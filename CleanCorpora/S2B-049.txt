I am extremely grateful to the Executive Committee of the
Indian Association  and to my fellow delegates
 for electing me to preside over the twenty-seventh annual conference
""
""
As the President of the  I deem it
my previlege  distinguished guests from India and
abroad  fellow academics from the Goa
University  to the twenty-seventh annual
conference 
""
American studies in India  had a chequered growth during the
last forty-five years  came under
the clouds  of international cold
war 
""
American studies in a systematic way  leaving it mainly to the
American funding  uh funding agencies or the binational agencies like the
""
""
However Indian policy makers  necessary
do their own bit 
""
A facile reason sometimes offered for American studies not being
considered  study of a
foreign language 
""
Thus in India and America  uh thus India and America are
separated by common language 
""
Hence outside the J N U  I doubt whether there is any University
in India 
""
In University of Bombay for instance  American studies were
sought to be introduced 
nineteen-sixties  with the help of University of Pennsylvania
""
""
But the conventional  was so strong
 amongst
the department of history  rather than
remain as one unit 
""
But since then one person specialising on America in each
department  Parkinson's
""
""
This is in contrast to study of the erstwhile Soviet Union 
""
What the Indian Americanist have 
""
""
However whenever any discussion has taken place on the question of
increasing contact  between the Indian scholars and their American
counterparts  our educational
bureaucrats  that they too be included in
the academic exchange programme 
""
Be that as it may  always tried to find answers
to the question  ?
""
Be its politics  or history or literature or culture or
civilisation 
""
There are many reasons  which could be advanced to answer the
question 
""
One vital reason  the U S today has emerged as the
only veto weilding  with a will
power to commit  collective
good albeit as it sees it 
""
To learn about the U S therefore is to remove our own ignorance
 in achieving
their goals 
""
Such ignorance galored in our  and policy
makers 
""
Public ignorance  but its impact
on our bilateral relations is indirect 
""
But ignorance on the part of policy maker can cause avoidable harm
to the friendly relations 
""
To give one example very few of our policy makers are aware  of
the fact that  cannot
always act 
""
Thus in nineteen eighty-three when a few legislators  along
with a very low level state departmental official met some Sikh separatist
outside the committees home  created an uproar
""
""
Another reason is that 
with a continous history of two hundred and sixteen years  feel
that 
our ever evolving political system 
""
This is true of our 
""
Most of those who have contributed  a great deal to creative
work in our regional language  like Marathi or
Kannada  or more specifically
""
""
If I do not venture to mention  some names of such creative
writers  that I do not wish to generate
 as well as those included
""
""
In the area  where I can
claim some expertise  search for some
answers  from the American political
system 
""
There is nothing wrong if we look at the American political system
for answers to our own problem 
""
As the American political 
certain unique political concepts  to organise sharing of political power
like federalism 
""
The countries of South Asian region for instance  look to our
democratic political experience  to develop their own democratic
institutions 
""
Today India as an ancient society  attempting to build a modern
political system 
""
First communalisation of politics second  political instability
 a threat to
national unity 
""
As India has faced many challenges in the past and somehow 
managed to survive  there is a false complacency that we could overcome
""
""
But it is my considered opinion  that we are sitting on the tip
of a volcano  if corrective steps are
not taken 
""
Hence before these challenges go out of control  I strongly feel
that we need to switch over  to uh a presidential system of government
""
""
Tinkering with the existing parliamentary system won't help us
anymore 
""
Presidential government need not be a copy of the American system
""
""
But  borrowing essential
from American system 
our major political problems can be brought under control 
""
India is a multi-regional  multi- linguistic and multi-religious
society 
""
This diversity and this uh  our founding
fathers tried to hold together  in a parliamentary system within a federal
structure 
""
This was  as
introduced by the Government of India Act nineteen thirty-five 
""
This is unlike the American experience  after their
independence from the British colonialism  Americans though familiar with
the British parliamentary system  created a unique system of presidential
government  their
hetrogenous population 
""
The parliamentary system can function well only when  there is
a two party system 
""
In a more homogenous society as in Britain  Parliamentary
system add political instability  face
splits as in nineteen twenty-four and nineteen twenty-nine 
""
Basic problem with the parliamentary democracy in India  is one
of our failure to develop 
""
With the Indian National Congress inheriting the mantle of glory of
freedom struggle  the congress party enjoyed one party dominions
nationally 
""
But by nineteen sixty-seven  there were clear signs that All
India National Congress  and
emerging as only vote catching  in the uh
""
""
In the process 
political majority in different states by putting together  dominant caste
and uh  coalitions like KHAM Kshatriya
Harijans Adivasis and Muslims 
""
The  selecting candidates
 executive positions on caste and communal uh
""
""
This was only vulgarised by V P Singh in his uh  effort to
develop an alternative to the congress 
""
He started with uh  Jath Gurjars
and uh Rajputs coalitions 
""
And later tried to expand it by adding the O B C  by announcing
the acceptance of uh  Mandal
Commission 
""
The B J P answered  and
trying to bring together highly pluralistic Hindus  under their political
banner 
""
Today  all political parties from the left to the right are
basically communal  Justice Krishna
Iyyer 
""
Why this communalisation of political process  ?
""
It is mainly 
who aspires to lead the  nation as the Prime Minister must command a
sizable following  within the party to be the leader of the legislature
party 
""
To do so Indian leaders have found it easy to appeal  on caste
and communal basis  or the
other section of the community  uh issue
and programme based party 
""
In this kind of caste and community based politics  power
sharing 
bas  or community in the
parliament 
""
As a result it is better to be a leader of a small party commanding
loyalties 
of issue based political party 
""
When uh  forming a stable
government becomes difficult 
becomes inevitable 
""
But from the caste or communal angle  a cabinet post in a
coalition  rather than when the
particular caste or community 
""
This has tended to fragment Indian political parties 
""
Thus inspite of the Congress and Janata Dal  and others wooing
scheduled castes  they have found it necessary to found their own party
""
out from the Janata Dal after it lost the power in nineteen ninety 
""
Today there are thirty-three political parties  all fractions in
""
""
While the first  after fifty-two election
""
""
In the process  no political party has been able to get a
rolling majority after nineteen eighty-four elections 
""
So long this trend of appealing for votes and post on caste and
communal basis continues  fragmentation of political parties is bound to
continue 
""
The result of communalisation of electoral politics  has
been political  instability both at the
states 
""
Instability in state is not a new phenomenon  but political
instability at the centre  is a new phenomenon particularly under the
Congress party 
""
What has brought this thing at the centre  ?
""
Clearly the absence of a ruling family 
""
Mrs Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi  tried to maintain
their individual control over the party  through
the iron rule of political instability  uh political destabilisation of
individual Chief Ministers  whenever
they showed any 
""
Since the end of the Nehru-Gandhi family rule  the centre has
seen  as well on a day to day
base 
""
It is politics all the way 
""
Hence the government has no time to govern 
""
If in the past non congress efforts to form the government  at
the centre have invariably ended in the political uh in the vertical splits
in the ruling party  Janata Party in nineteen seventy-nine and the Janata
Dal in nineteen ninety  is not
cleared today 
""
In contrast to this  American presidential system has been able
to provide 
""
Reasonable because 
on presidential aspirants  after Franklin D Roosevelt was elected for a
fourth term 
""
Only two  Eisenhover and Reagan where able to complete eight
years in the office  seven presidents were in the White
House for less than two terms 
""
It still  when we note that
Carter in his four year term 
and Bush in 
""
This stability 
is based on the principle  between the
executive and legislative branches  which has made President co-ordinate
and independant  functions
""
""
President thus enjoys a fixed tenure  and cannot be removed by
the Congress except through impeachment  which is extremely difficult and
rare
