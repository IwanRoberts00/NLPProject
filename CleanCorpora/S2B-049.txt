<I>
""

I am extremely grateful to the Executive Committee of the
""
""
""
""
As the President of the  I deem it
""
""
University  to the twenty-seventh annual
""
""
""
""
the clouds  of international cold
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A facile reason sometimes offered for American studies not being
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in India 
""
""
sought to be introduced 
""
""
""
""
""
the department of history  rather than
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What the Indian Americanist have 
""
""
""
increasing contact  between the Indian scholars and their American
counterparts  our educational
""
""
""
Be that as it may  always tried to find answers
to the question  ?
""
""
civilisation 
""
""
question 
""
""
only veto weilding  with a will
power to commit  collective
""
""
""
 in achieving
their goals 
""
""
""
""
""
on our bilateral relations is indirect 
""
""
to the friendly relations 
""
""
the fact that  cannot
always act 
""
Thus in nineteen eighty-three when a few legislators  along
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
writers  that I do not wish to generate
 as well as those included
""
""
In the area  where I can
claim some expertise  search for some
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
democratic political experience  to develop their own democratic
""
""
""
""
""
First communalisation of politics second  political instability
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But it is my considered opinion  that we are sitting on the tip
""
not taken 
""
Hence before these challenges go out of control  I strongly feel
that we need to switch over  to uh a presidential system of government
""
""
""
anymore 
""
Presidential government need not be a copy of the American system
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fathers tried to hold together  in a parliamentary system within a federal
""
""
""
""
""
This is unlike the American experience  after their
""
""
government  their
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of our failure to develop 
""
""
freedom struggle  the congress party enjoyed one party dominions
""
""
""
""
emerging as only vote catching  in the uh
""
""
""
""
""
Harijans Adivasis and Muslims 
""
""
 executive positions on caste and communal uh
""
""
This was only vulgarised by V P Singh in his uh  effort to
""
""
""
""
""
And later tried to expand it by adding the O B C  by announcing
the acceptance of uh  Mandal
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Iyyer 
""
""
""
""
who aspires to lead the  nation as the Prime Minister must command a
""
""
""
""
""
other section of the community  uh issue
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As a result it is better to be a leader of a small party commanding
loyalties 
of issue based political party 
""
""
""
""
""
""
coalition  rather than when the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
out from the Janata Dal after it lost the power in nineteen ninety 
""
Today there are thirty-three political parties  all fractions in
""
""
While the first  after fifty-two election
""
""
""
""
""
""
communal basis continues  fragmentation of political parties is bound to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
instability at the centre  is a new phenomenon particularly under the
Congress party 
""
What has brought this thing at the centre  ?
""
Clearly the absence of a ruling family 
""
""
their individual control over the party  through
""
individual Chief Ministers  whenever
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If in the past non congress efforts to form the government  at
""
in the ruling party  Janata Party in nineteen seventy-nine and the Janata
""
cleared today 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
years in the office  seven presidents were in the White
""
""
""
Carter in his four year term 
""
""
This stability 
is based on the principle  between the
""
""
""
""
""
the Congress except through impeachment  which is extremely difficult and
rare
