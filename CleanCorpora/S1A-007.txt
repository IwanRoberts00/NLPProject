costly yeah 
""
""
The sea fish from Andhra
""
""
No no we have river fishes here
""
""
No I mean from Andhra that fish goes from Andhra is from the
river
""
""
Sweet water

""
""
""
""
We we take 
""
""
We also take elish 
little bit of salt
""
""
Yeah
""
""
We don't have here this usage as such in our language 
""
We have a ho hon  it makes the different
you know we people get problematic from phonetics again 
""
So what about you  ?
""
What you
""
""
""
""
Sometimes we take eggs 
""
Like my family all the people they are taking non-veg  but only
me 
""
""
Can you tell us something
""
""
""
""
""
Ah my  my personal choice
""
""
You like you know  better things when you feel
""
""
Could you tell us some recipes that we can learn it ?
""
""
Aha 
""
""
Recipe is simple thing is I  uh
boiled vegetables
""
I think you won't like 
""
""
 boiled vegetables
""
When 
that's 
""
""
So uh  and
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah it should be very much 
""
""
""
""
Just 
 that mustard leaves
""
""
""
""
""
We 
""
""
Into small
""
""
Into small pieces very small pieces 
""
And then at least in my house like we have got a  choola
""
""
 what you
call
""
""
Yes
""
""
So in that there is uh  and in that we put
""
In the morning we  I mean we put some water in it
and in the afternoon it becomes very much well mashed up  well prepared
""
Then we put all those 
 we put
""
""
It becomes very tasty
""
""
""
""
""
But the main thing is we stress upon butter and  desi
ghee 
""
""
""
""
Do you add a bit of flour later ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You keep some  of
""
""
No 
""
""
 and that makes it much tasty
""
""
Tasty 
""
""
Tasty to have to eat
""
Tasty that in many punjabi family staying near we get it
""
But then somehow I can't prepare it
""
 the burning as per the initials
""
""
Even you can't do it in a pressure cooker ?
""
""
No we can do it in a pressure cooker
""
""
But it won't be that tasty 
""
""
Actually that family  my family is traditional
""
""
So  got my old grandmother and making for us you know
""
""
So like if we have to make 
""
""
""
 saag
 ?
""
""
Yeah we boil the 
""
""
Then you fry it 
""
""
Uh not nothing to fry  desi ghee
 and all those
""
""
After that cook it for some time
""
""
 make it red
""
""
Then put some  powder and some little bit of
chilli 
""
Then we put that masala into the mustard 
""
""
You put tomatoes also in it ?
""
""
""
""
It gives taste  even tomatoes
""
""
But what you like eating ?
""
""
""
""
 a kind of
essential for 
""
""
""
""
""
Lunch and dinner 
""
""
""
when  got
""
""
""
""
""
Fried fish 
""
""
Fried fish 
""
So we have fish we have to have it
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Plenty of fish
""
""
Plenty of fish
""
If we don't eat fish we feel very  we haven't eaten any
thing 
""
""
""
""
""
And you know it  you know it
can go upto seventy eighty a kg and even then 
""
On every occasion you have to have fish 
""
How do you 
""
""
 a very tasty
fish
""
""
You put some curd also making a fish ?
""
""
Yes
""
""
Curd and cream also
""
""
Yes sometimes 
""
That depends upon the  preparing
""
""
Yeah 
""
If you want to make a fried fish  what you do
""
""
You just 
""
""
 in mustard oil
""
""
Mustard oil
""
We use mustard oil for  fish preparation I mean even the newer
generation which is using uh refined oil  uhm it uses mustard oil for the
 fish preparation
""
""
You can use refined oil for whatever 
""
""
Yes you know refined you know  or
""
""
No
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The taste it is very flavour but they say  lot
of cholestrol there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But fish in itself doesn't contain as much as cholestrol as a
egg or meat 
""
""
And I think you must be frying in 
kadai 
""
""
Yeah  yes
""
""
Iron one or
""
""
Iron one 
""
""
Or the brass ?
""
""
Better  Iron one is better because it doesn't stick to the
""
""
Stick to it
""
""
And those  uh non stick things if you don't have because
""
""
They don't have a rounded base
""
""
""
shallow base 
""
So there should be plenty of
""
""
""
""
""
Then uh then you just fry it and then what you do ?
""
""
First we  I mean wash cut and wash the fishes and then we
put some uh salt and 
and leave it to marinate say for about 
uhm  deep fry it more or less in oil
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I mean the most common preparation is with  uh
grounded mustard 
""
We fry the fish 
haldi 
kadai  and
 all
""
""
""
""
""
I mean that is the easiest way
""
And you can even steam it
""
""
Steam it with the ingredients
""
""
""
""
""
 you do it
""
 you know you can
put in the pressure if you want it separated and get 
""
""
 all means you don't cook the heat or just
""
Because the  itself is a very I mean easily
cooked fish 
""
And I mean we prefer sweet water fish to  sea fish
""
""
Sea fish
""
""
Yes we don't eat the sea fish 
""
 in the
market
""
""
""
""
""
Especially in winter 
""
That too we go for prawns
""
""
Prawns
""
""
 you get the prawns
""
""
Don't like prawns 
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
Yes of course  you know people they when they talk of
prawns you know when
""
""
See you know we people are so considerate that we take
 and
 much more
concentrated on these type of foods you know 
""
Regarding non-veg we take that meat and 
and all that 
""
But atleast I don't take
""
""
""
""
""
Have you tried uh  taking fish in uh
""
""
In the Oven ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
No I haven't
""
Have you ?
""
""
Yes  uh I prefer it more you know that means you have to
have less  of oil
""
""
Any fish ?
""
""
Any fish
""
No we get this you know
""
I don't know what you call it this side 
""
 what do you
call it
""
""
Uh no
""
We have we call it semi  and we have
different  putthi
 very sweet
""
""
""
""
""
 we just
marinate it with lemon or something and all
""
Keep it for sometime then I usually make a sauce 
""
""
""
""
""
Sauce ?
""
""
Maybe a cheese sauce  white sauce
with egg 
""
And you don't need to do it
""
Sometimes I just  put
you know  ginger and
garlic 
""
Then you just give a topping 
""
""
""
""
""
So that cheese melts and 
""
""
 got
this 
""
So  the easiest way you put it inside and then you are studying
you don't have to fry it it takes time then I make the  one or
two words 
""
Press inside the fish cut it from
