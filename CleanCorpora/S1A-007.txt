Ah my it's my personal choice
You like you know it's better things when you feel

Could you tell us some recipes that we can learn it ?
Aha 
Recipe is simple thing is I mostly I stress upon uh
boiled vegetables
I think you won't like to take it 
 No I'm not boiled vegetables
When I'm all by myself I had to do that cooking so 
that's the best thing I suppose 
So uh we prefer more on makke ki roti and
 sarson ka sag laughter 
 Sarson ka sag 
Yeah it should be very much sarson ka sag 
 I'm very fond of it 
Just uh this what you call that leaves and you know all 
 mustard leaves that mustard leaves
 Mustard leaves 
We first of all we wash it then we cut and uh 
Into small
Into small pieces very small pieces 
And then at least in my house like we have got a choola
 
 We've got a uhm angeethi what you
call
Yes
So in that there is uh earthen pot and in that we put
In the morning we ca we I mean we put some water in it
and in the afternoon it becomes very much well mashed up well prepared
Then we put all those coriander and something uh 
 tomato tomato and everything all the masalas we put
It becomes very tasty
 Tomato 
But the main thing is we stress upon butter and desi
ghee 
 Desi ghee 
Do you add a bit of flour later ?
Yeah 
You keep some basen of
No haan we put some basen 
 Basen and that makes it much tasty
Tasty 
Tasty to have to eat
Tasty that in many punjabi family staying near we get it
But then somehow I can't prepare it
 It's the burning as per the initials
Even you can't do it in a pressure cooker ?
No we can do it in a pressure cooker
But it won't be that tasty 
Actually that family it's my family is traditional
So I've got my old grandmother and making for us you know
So like if we have to make we'll naturally prefer a 
 pressure cooker 
 Pressure cooker you boil the saag
 ?
Yeah we boil the saag 
Then you fry it 
Uh not nothing to fry just to put desi ghee
 and all those
After that cook it for some time
 Haan onion we pre make it red
Then put some haldi powder and some little bit of
chilli as per the taste 
Then we put that masala into the mustard 
You put tomatoes also in it ?
 Haan tomatoes also 
It gives taste even tomatoes
But what you like eating ?
 It's uh I mean fish laughter 
 We'll have it in uh I mean it's a kind of
essential for both the lunch and uh 
 Yes that's it is you feel like uh 
Lunch and dinner you take 
 Yeah both even the chapatis 
when we've got
 Accha 
Fried fish 
Fried fish 
So we have fish we have to have it
Uhm
Plenty of fish
Plenty of fish
If we don't eat fish we feel very we haven't eaten any
thing 
 We haven't eaten any thing 
And you know it price is not the thing you know it
can go upto seventy eighty a kg and even then you've it 
On every occasion you have to have fish 
How do you you have kaliya 
 Kaliya I mean it's a very tasty
fish
You put some curd also making a fish ?
Yes
Curd and cream also
Yes sometimes 
That depends upon the dish you're preparing
Yeah 
If you want to make a fried fish what you do
You just fry it 
 Fry it in mustard oil
Mustard oil
We use mustard oil for fish preparation I mean even the newer
generation which is using uh refined oil uhm it uses mustard oil for the
 fish preparation
You can use refined oil for whatever 
Yes you know refined you know postman or
 saffola whatever you use its of no use 
No
 It won't allow the taste to come through 
 It won't allow the taste to come through 
The taste it is very flavour but they say you've lot
of cholestrol there 
 Mustard oil 
 Mustard oil 
But fish in itself doesn't contain as much as cholestrol as a
egg or meat 
And I think you must be frying in uh this iron 
kadai 
Yeah kadai yes
Iron one or
Iron one hi 
Or the brass ?
Better Iron one is better because it doesn't stick to the
Stick to it
And those uh non stick things if you don't have because
They don't have a rounded base
 Na they're shal 
shallow base 
So there should be plenty of
 So that uh 
Then uh then you just fry it and then what you do ?
First we I mean wash cut and wash the fishes and then we
put some uh salt and haldi uhm in it 
and leave it to marinate say for about five or ten minutes 
uhm and then we fry it deep fry it more or less in oil
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
And I mean the most common preparation is with uh
grounded mustard 
We fry the fish and then we grind the mustard put 
haldi water and green chillies and put into the 
kadai along with the fish and salt to taste and
 that's all
 One word 
I mean that is the easiest way
And you can even steam it
Steam it with the ingredients
 Hilsa 
 Hilsa you do it
 It's like you put in if you don't you know you can
put in the pressure if you want it separated and get 
 It's all means you don't cook the heat or just
Because the Hilsa itself is a very I mean easily
cooked fish 
And I mean we prefer sweet water fish to sea fish
Sea fish
Yes we don't eat the sea fish 
 It's only occasionally when it comes in the
market
 Occasionally 
Especially in winter 
That too we go for prawns
Prawns
 Haan you get the prawns
Don't like prawns 
No laughs 
 I've never seen anybody taking that in my family 
Yes of course you know people they when they talk of
prawns you know when
See you know we people are so considerate that we take
 alu ke parathe and gobi ke parathe and
 sarso ka saag makke ki roti we're much more
concentrated on these type of foods you know 
Regarding non-veg we take that meat and chicken 
and all that 
But atleast I don't take
 Biryani 
Have you tried uh taking fish in uh
In the Oven ?
Yeah
No I haven't
Have you ?
Yes uh I prefer it more you know that means you have to
have less of oil
Any fish ?
Any fish
No we get this you know
I don't know what you call it this side 
 We've the names of uh supposed to call what do you
call it
Uh no
We have we call it semi putthi and we have
different putthi semi putthi
 and it's very sweet
 Putthi 
 Semi means sugar and then we just
marinate it with lemon or something and all
Keep it for sometime then I usually make a sauce 
 Yeah 
Sauce ?
Maybe a cheese sauce and get into a egg white sauce
with egg 
And you don't need to do it
Sometimes I just just fry a bit slightly and then put
you know I just put into a tomato sauce and onion then ginger and
garlic and big chillies or capsicum whatever you've 
Then you just give a topping you give uh cheese 
 Ginger and garlic 
So that cheese melts and one word 
 I've uh actually I've got
this griller also in my gas stove 
So the easiest way you put it inside and then you are studying
you don't have to fry it it takes time then I make the fish uh one or
two words 
Press inside the fish cut it from one word
