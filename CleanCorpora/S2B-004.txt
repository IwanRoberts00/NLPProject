The system of providing telephone connections through radio

through line 
More so in the rural areas 
Sometimes it is not feasible to provide telephone connections in

The system operates on a very high frequency V H F 
The radio unit will be kept in the central place from where 
telephone wire can be thrown and only the telephone set has to be
installed in the subscribers premises

of tele-communication to change the frequency of the sets whenever needed
Whole blood need not be given to a patient any longer 
Fractionation of blood or separation of blood into its components
 has come to India too 
The Central government has recently set up a three point seven
 crore rupee project in Bombay for this purpose 
Our correspondent Seema Murlidhar has the details 
Blood can now be broken down to its elements in India
also 
Broadly speaking human blood has red blood corpuscles 
platalet and proteins like algumin fibrogin and immoglobins suspended in
water 
Each component has a specific role to play in the body 
Uptill now whole blood had to be given to a patient in need of
even one of these components 
Now with the breakdown of blood at the plasma centre of K
E M hospital a patient of anaemia can be given R B C's alone 
or a victim of burns can get algumin only 
A highly sophisticated technique called tromatography is being
used for separation of blood components 
This way one unit of blood which was being used for one person
alone can now be used by eight 
This can go a long way in overcoming the shortage of blood in
India
