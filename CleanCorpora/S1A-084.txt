<I>
""
""
See my  from
Cochin 
""
""
""
Do you  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yes I feel that 
agriculture 
""
""
""
""
""
Then 
the development of agriculture during this 
age  ?
""
""
""
""
""
No
""
""
Then 
""
""
I think so that  important at
this stage 
climatic conditions  before
just two months back 
that it was not 
""
""
Actually what the crops needed  I feel like that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But now it has uh  uhm
 extend I feel
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  going to talk about the
development 
comparing India with other 
""
I want to know more about the development  how we can develop
our own 
""
Now it is we are depending 
 other countries we are depending now a
days 
""
But I want to  how we can develop our agriculture
in India 
""
How we can keep  uh
biological  and we are totally
 we are
grafting  to develop it
more and more  that you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh
""
""
But I feel 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Soil 
""
""
Soil 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Okay  and each
one chemical fertilizers differ
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Chemicals were being used  for growing the
crops
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
I feel like that
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
If they depend on the high quality chemicals 
then the crops will grow better 
 I
don't think the crops will grow 
means this all depends on  what they use
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  uhm
 haan
""
twenty-five years back  we are not much depending on the chemicals
 we are using that cowdung
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Cowdung and all
""
""
We are using that  waste
""
""
""
""
""
""
Waste materials
""
""
Waste materials 
 uh keep the
fertility  and we can keep the taste of that
""
""
Now a days we are not getting that taste  we
were enjoying  twenty-five years back
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
That taste is  and now a days is uh
 quite different
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What you know  they are
using all the superior materials  because of that only the
taste is going  in olden days they used to use all old
methods  now new methods have been started
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Like uh  water facilities
and all
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Due to that also and especially they use this different types
of chemicals what they use
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Rough chemicals
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
In olden days what they used to use that cowdung manure 
 and different types of soil
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But now those soil also are not  I
 due to the
soil is not 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Soil is not 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
whether we can go to the  is it useful to our
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
 they don't
 use of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I want 
""
""
I feel like that
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
What is my opinion is no  we can have the
olden methods  but in a modern type
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Way ah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See  irrigation
system  we can use
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And we can use this uh waste material  of our things
 and we
must keep in that uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Bio gas 
""
""
Bio  gas
""
""
""
""
""
This bio means 
""
""
Manure manure
""
""
Manure  bio manure
""
""
Ah  that cowdung if we waste uh which is decayed and we
can keep those 
if we use  everything
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Now what we are eating no 
""
""
 I
feel
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn  uh the
Americans will only will prove that it is a poisonous thing  after using
this chemicals and all no you will become a  uh this uh harmful only for
our health 
""
My opinion is that if we go to our olden days  but in a modern
way 
irrigation we can use for dripping and all that is quite 
and useful for us 
""
But manure which we use now a days we can change
""
If we change that  and if if we
concentrate 
the  Gandhiji
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Had started
""
""
Dreamt  I would say
""
It is not materialised
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
It is only a 
""
If everyone 
after  and services and industries
""
If we use our own  our own land for our
agriculture purpose 
food 
""
And  if we
concentrate our  we need not depend on others
and we can have our own things so 
""
And uh this uhm  if we use all this
without using chemicals more  manure it is quite
good  that in India it
is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in in other countries it is not
possible but in India it is possible  because it is each
one in uh 
old things only  all these
things 
""
Many villages  so their
crops are growing  like that way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now it has  no that
""
""
""
""
""
Due to the temperatures no  due to the
monsoons also  it depends how much
 mostly it
depends upon the soil 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
 rain soil
""
""
Uhm soil 
""
""
And different types of manure  when
these three things are used or levelled  when they are
 there is no harm
in agriculture 
""
That is no harm in growing the crops  but
these things must be in a right order I feel 
 because all these three must three
things must come in a  we
can grow agriculture
""
But I found some of them  even though they are means even in
their house they have a small crop  haan
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 we can
""
""
They do  uhm
 store water for the crops to grow
""
""
What they are making for their own 
uhm 
""
Now some people are doing like that way 
simply keep on buying buying  first
of all 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 are
""
uhm  I feel like that way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Because we ourself are doing there  in our
place  beans and all
 we have done
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And it is growing 
 we are putting
""
""
uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh this inventions
are there  depend on sun now
a days 
""
If gardens are there we can  uh keep the heat with
the proper want  and we
can keep those heat temperature I mean
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Temperature and all
""
""
Temperature  how
much water that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
you 
 then and India will become a prosperous
country  then all
these three things  I
feel that way 
""
Even if there is no water  we can bring water
from  we can
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the cultivation is 
""
""
 important
""
""
Essential now 
""
We can 
machines  with the use of that mechanical technology technology with
technology we can  this machine
""
""
But agriculture  this uh
inflation will go high 
one word 
""
After all uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There is some
""
""
An Indian
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Means  we have to depend fully on agriculture and we have
to develop our land 
""
We have to develop our 
""
And in such a way  that it is useful for the ordinary man
""
""
Man 
""
""
Common man can do this agriculture  uhm uh
""
""
Materials and all 
""
""
 we can
cultivate the land  and our uh people also
should be very 
""
And especially
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Hard working makes more  yeah
 I feel like that way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
When once you are hard working in your work what you do 
 in the
end
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  and for health of the old man or medium man
""
""
Yeah
""
""
If we start the agriculture no I I don't mean that it should
go on the large scale  if it is
""
""
Just you start  small scale
""
""
""
""
""
You may have heard no
""
""
 yeah
""
""
Even one drops make a  ocean
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
