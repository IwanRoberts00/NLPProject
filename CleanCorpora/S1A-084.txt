<I>
See my name is Susheela Padmanabhan from
Cochin 
 I'd like to deal with agriculture in India 
Do you ?
 Uh 
Yes I feel that I'm interested in too 
agriculture 
 Too 
Then can you suggest to me something about 
the development of agriculture during this age in this 
age and this year ?
 At this stage 
No
Then 
I think so that agriculture is not more important at
this stage due to the uhn climate uhn 
climatic conditions uhn because I found that before
just two months back uh just one month time uhn 
that it was not rain raining very heavily 
 uh see the monsoon was not that much perfect uhn 
Actually what the crops needed uhn I feel like that
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
 Uh 
 uhn 
 Uh 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
Uhm 
But now it has uh the monsoon has started uhm
 to a middle extend I feel
 Uhm 
Uhm uhn I'm going to talk about the
development we want in especially in India when are 
comparing India with other countries 
I want to know more about the development how we can develop
our own crops uhm 
Now it is we are depending more more for 
 on othe other countries we are depending now a
days uhm 
But I want to have idea how we can develop our agriculture
in India with our own efforts 
How we can keep our own crops means now a days that uh
biological experiments are going on ahn and we are totally
 changing our crops all this uh biological experiments we are
grafting we are taking other crops uh to develop it
more and more to uhm produce more size uhn uhm that you
 may be knowing 
 Countries 
 Uhm 
 More 
 Uhm 
 Efforts 
 Ahn 
 Uh 
 Uhm 
But uh
But I feel uhn you told me about the crop 
 uhm much depends upon the soil 
 Uhn 
 Uhm 
Soil 
Soil 
Uhn 
Okay each one soil differs uhm and each
one chemical fertilizers differ
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Chemicals were being used uhm for growing the
crops
 Uhm 
Yeah 
I feel like that
Uhm uhm 
If they depend on the high quality chemicals uhm 
then the crops will grow better uhm I feel like that way 
 uhn and if they use uh just rough materials uhm I
don't think the crops will grow uhm grow uhm 
means this all depends on the materials uhm what they use
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhn 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm but my opinion is know uhm
 if we don't use chemicals ah also haan
 we can uh keep our crops when we are during uh 
twenty-five years back we are not much depending on the chemicals
 uhm we are using that cowdung
 I think 
 Uhm 
 Ah 
 Haan 
 Twenty-five years back ahn 
 Uhm 
Cowdung and all
We are using that one word uhn waste
 Uhn 
Waste materials
Waste materials uhm with that no if we 
 continues continue that only we can uh keep the
fertility of the soil and we can keep the taste of that
 uh vegetable or fruits 
Now a days we are not getting that taste which we
were enjoying twenty-five years back
 Uhm 
 Of the soil uhm 
 But 
Uhm 
That taste is different and now a days is uh
 taste is quite different
 Different 
 But now 
What you know but now a days uhm they are
using all the superior materials uhm because of that only the
taste is going I see in olden days they used to use all old
methods uhm now new methods have been started
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 I see 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Like uh that uh different types of water facilities
and all
Uhm 
Due to that also and especially they use this different types
of chemicals what they use
Uhn 
Rough chemicals
Uhn 
In olden days what they used to use that cowdung manure 
 uhn and different types of soil
 Uhn 
Uhm 
But now those soil also are not available I
 think due to the uh this uh poverty and due to the
soil is not levelled 
 Uhn 
 That soil I know want 
Soil is not levelled here na 
 Ahn 
Uhm I want to uhm have an idea uhm 
whether we can go to the olden days agriculture is it useful to our
 Uhm 
Yes but I think so few of them follow this method 
 uhm few of them not to use the one word they don't
 laughs even know use of the
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
I want 
I feel like that
Yeah yeah 
What is my opinion is no ah we can have the
olden methods ah but in a modern type
 Ah 
 Ah 
Way ah
 In modern way 
 Ah modern way 
See uh dripping uh wat irrigation
system we can use
 Irrigation system 
Yeah 
And we can use this uh waste material of our things
 what this uh waste of vegetables and leaves and we
must keep in that uh cowdung cowdung and uh bio 
 Waste kya hota hai 
 Vegetables leaves and all 
 Cowdung 
Bio gas 
Bio it is not bio gas
 Gas is also bio 
This bio means 
Manure manure
Manure bio manure
Ah that cowdung if we waste uh which is decayed and we
can keep those uh give those manure and uh that system we can 
if we use no that taste the quality everything
 If follows 
Uhm
Now what we are eating no just a waste 
 It is just of a grass it is I
feel
 It is 
Uhn it is quite harmful after your years uh the
Americans will only will prove that it is a poisonous thing after using
this chemicals and all no you will become a uh this uh harmful only for
our health 
My opinion is that if we go to our olden days but in a modern
way modern type type of irrigation or 
irrigation we can use for dripping and all that is quite convinient 
and useful for us ah 
But manure which we use now a days we can change
If we change that system of manure and if if we
concentrate on this agriculture we can have our own India which 
the Gandhiji
 Type 
 Yeah 
 Ah 
Had started
Dreamt dreamt I would say
It is not materialised
 Dreamt 
Uhn 
It is only a dream of Gandhi 
If everyone uh instead of running beh uh 
after this jobs and services and industries
If we use our own India our own land for our
agriculture purpose we need not depend on other countries for 
food uhm that is my opinion 
And from let it be we got small poor or rich if we
concentrate our aim on this agriculture we need not depend on others
and we can have our own things so 
And uh this uhm my uh aim is know if we use all this
without using chemicals more if we use natural manure it is quite
good for our health for the taste uh that in India it
is possible 
 Dream of our Gandhi 
 Taking uh 
 India 
 Food 
 Ah yes natural manure 
 Possible in in other countries it is not
possible but in India it is possible uhm because it is each
one in uh we actually we Indians uhm use different 
old things only uhm old material old manure all these
things 
Many villages are using this type of old things so their
crops are growing I feel like that way
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Growing but uh 
Now it has some no that
 But 
Due to the temperatures no uhm due to the
monsoons also uhm and due to the it depends how much
 ma manure and all the this soil uhm mostly it
depends upon the soil 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm that is depend on the rain 
 That is the and rain soil
Uhm soil 
And different types of manure uhm when
these three things are used or levelled uhm when they are
 put in a proper order uhm I feel there is no harm
in agriculture 
That is no harm in growing the crops uhm but
these things must be in a right order I feel I feel like this 
 uhm uhm uh okay because all these three must three
things must come in a right line then only you I feel that we
can grow agriculture
But I found some of them even though they are means even in
their house they have a small crop they grow uh haan
 kitchen garden 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
 Okay 
 Uhm garden 
 Kitchen garden we can
They do they even if there is no rain uhm
 they just try to uhm store water for the crops to grow
What they are making for their own livelihood 
uhm for their own purpose uhm I feel like that way 
Now some people are doing like that way uhm 
simply keep on buying buying then it is no means actually first
of all it is one word 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Means there is some kind of satisfaction 
 yeah at the time same time we are 
 Yeah 
 And you can say no that we are
 have done our own with our efforts 
uhm I feel like that way
 Making our 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Because we ourself are doing there uhm in our
place uhm different types of uh this beans and all
 uhm we have done
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
And it is growing uhm but we are doing 
 uhm when there is no rain uhm we are putting
 laughs we are storing one word for the water and all 
 uhm like that way when we get proper sunlight 
uhm heat soil monsoon all these things 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Now a days uh so many uh this inventions
are there uhm we can heat we need not uh depend on sun now
a days 
If gardens are there we can ke uh keep the heat with
the proper want those inventions are going on yeah and we
can keep those heat temperature I mean
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
Temperature and all
Temperature water we can give in time how
much water that crop need 
 Yeah exact 
 Ah that only I feel all these when 
you are have given everything in time know 
 uhm I think so then and India will become a prosperous
country uhm in agriculture uhm then all
these three things if they are looked after well uhm I
feel that way uhm 
Even if there is no water uhm we can bring water
from some dam storage or bring from anywhere and we can
 cultivate the land 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Yeah yeah 
And the cultivation is more 
 Most important
Essential now 
We can produce manufacture the 
machines with the use of that mechanical technology technology with
technology we can produce manufacture this machine
But agriculture is we depend on other countries this uh
inflation will go high high and uh it is not our 
one word to meet all this expenses 
After all uh 
 High 
 One word 
There is some
An Indian
Uhm 
Means we have to depend fully on agriculture and we have
to develop our land 
We have to develop our cro crops 
And in such a way that it is useful for the ordinary man
Man 
Common man can do this agriculture if all this uhm uh
Materials and all the soil 
 What is needed that if it is given we can
cultivate the land properly uh and our uh people also
should be very hard working 
And especially
 Land properly 
 Hard working 
Hard working makes more ah man yeah
 uh ha happier life yeah I feel like that way
 Ah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Uhn 
When once you are hard working in your work what you do 
 uhm you will gain for what you have done yeah in the
end
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
Yeah and for health of the old man or medium man
Yeah
If we start the agriculture no I I don't mean that it should
go on the large scale if it is
Just you start from the small scale
 Large scale 
You may have heard no
 Haan yeah
Even one drops make a a sea ocean
 Sea 
Yeah
