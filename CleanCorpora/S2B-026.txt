Hello viewers 
""
All of us are interested  to speak
English fluently 
""
But many of us are unnecessarily diffident about it 
""
You will find  and constant
effort  in the
ability to speak English 
""
The aim of this programme  some of those
aspects of speech 
""
I am sure all of us refer to a dictionary  whenever we don't know
the meaning of a word 
""
But we quickly have a look at the meaning  and then close the
dictionary 
""
There is one important bit of information  which we generally
don't use 
""
Every good dictionary 
""
Whenever you refer to a dictionary  that
immediately after the entry of the word  or
transcription is given in bracket 
""
 given
in the dictionary 
""
This word  agreement
""
""
Listen carefully 
""
We are aware  agreement
 and this pronunciation seems to be influenced by spelling
""
""
Look at the first symbol 
""
It is rather a strange letter 
in the ordinary letters 
""
That  for the sound
 in English
""
""
The next three symbols  gree
""
""
""
If you put this together  agreement
""
""
You will find that there are about fifteen such strange looking
symbols 
""
And it is a matter of a few minutes  to get familiar with those
symbols 
""
You will find that once you know those symbols  you will have
the ability  given in a dictionary
""
""
Any dictionary gives  right at
the beginning 
""
For example 
""
In this table  there are some
symbols 
""
Towards the right  which point out
what are the sounds 
""
If you go through this carefully  in
fact you already know many of the symbols 
""
As I said  that you will have
to try and remember 
""
Let us move on 
""
As we all know  and consonant sounds
""
""
""
""
First  lip
""
""
Listen carefully again to these two words  lip
""
""
You will find 
of these two words 
""
The first sound  i
""
""
The second one is a long sound  and
that gives you 
""
Have a look at the next pair of words  pull
""
""
Listen again  pool
""
""
The contrast  and long
""
""
I would like to give you a simple hint 
""
In case of short vowels  try to make your vowels as short as
possible 
""
And in case of long vowels  try to make them as long as you can
""
""
This will help you retain the distinction  between the short
vowels and long vowels 
""
 which are
problematic to many Indian users of English 
""
""
fan 
""
Listen again  finish
""
""
Many Indians have a problem  in articulating the first sound
""
""
Instead of saying  they say
""
""
""
Have a close look at my lips now 
""
The English sound is  fan
""
""
And you will observe  between the
lower lip and the upper teeth 
""
Please observe again 
finish 
""
In the Indian equivalent  you will find that there is a contact
between the two lips 
""
Look carefully 
""
Many Indians say 
phinish  fan
""
""
""
think 
""
Again 
""
The first sound is 
tha 
""
Many Indians say  thank
""
""
I hope you hear the difference 
and the Indian equivalent 
""
Listen again to the difference 
""
The English pronunciation  the Indian
pronunciation  the English pronunciation
 thank
""
""
What really happens in the articulation of the English sounds is
 the air
comes out 
""
Look again 
""
And if you are a little aware  of how these sounds are produced
""
""
We have to take one important piece of care 
""
Many of us  and then to
pronunciation 
""
This gives rise  as
spelling pronunciation 
""
Look at the next three words on the screen 
""
The first word 
""
Some of you might wonder  that this word has another possible
pronunciation 
""
""
""
Some words in English  have two or more acceptable
pronunciations 
""
This word is either  IPA
symbols - immediate 
""
""
Many Indians think  m
""
""
And therefore they think  that the pronunciation must be
immediately 
""
But  m
 IPA symbols -
immediate 
""
The next word 
ring 
""
Listen again 
""
But the British pronunciation would be  IPA symbols - rin
""
""
The difference is in the last sound 
""
In the British pronunciation  ga
""
""
 IPA symbol -
ring 
""
Similarly  IPA
symbols - ringing 
""
Again there is no 
""
There is a tendency to go by spelling  and this is one
important piece of care  about
English pronunciation 
""
In the pronunciation that we showed you  from the dictionary
""
""
Before  you must have seen a short
vertical stroke 
what it was 
""
In fact  or the stress mark
""
""
Accent or stress  is a very important feature of English speech
 that that lead to intelligibility of English
""
""
Between the correct articulation of vowels and consonants  and
the correct accent  is the right
accent 
""
And therefore  all of us should be bothered about this feature
""
""
You will find that  the accent is
indicated 
""
Most of them  before the
accented syllable 
""
 have a look at some of these words on the screen
""
""
The first word is 
""
Now this word is made up of three syllables 
 ter
""
""
Remember that all these three parts are not said with equal
emphasis 
""
Listen again  and you will
find  the first
part 
""
I must not pronounce the word  or character
""
""
It has been found out  by
the right accent 
""
And there has been an experiment  where
it was found 
English speakers 
""
You might wonder why this happened 
""
Look at the next word on the screen  find
""
""
Therefore  that if the
word  had accent on the second syllable it
couldn't be that word 
""
It has to be a word  which has accent on the second syllable
""
""
And therefore  which has
accent on the second syllable 
""
In the word director  there is accent on the second syllable
""
""
Again as I told you before  this word has another possible
pronunciation 
""
In whichever way you pronounce it  the accent must be on the
second syllable 
""
 which is often
mispronounced by Indians 
""
There is accent on the third syllable  neither on the first
syllable nor on the second  employee
""
""
Whereas many of us tend to say  I am an employee of this
institution 
""
The correct pronunciation would be  I am an employee of this
organisation 
""
The next word is an interesting case 
""
All of us know this word  that this word
functions 
""
Depending on its grammatical role  there is a change in accent
""
""
When it is a noun or an adjective  there is accent on the
first syllable 
""
When it is a verb  to the second
syllable 
""
""
""
First of all  as a
noun 
""
He gave me a nice birthday present 
""
The word as an adjective  thirty students were present in the
class yesterday 
""
The word as a verb  we are going to present a play tonight
""
""
And I hope you have listened to the two different pronunciations
""
""
The main difference 
""
In English there are a few words  pairs of nouns and verbs
""
""
If they are nouns  there is usually accent on the first
syllable  there is usually accent on the second
syllable 
""
""
""
The next word on the screen 
""
If it is a noun  if it is
a verb 
""
And I hope you hear the difference in accent 
""
""
""
The agricultural produce in India has gone up 
""
India produces a lot of wheat 
""
Therefore  which can function either
as nouns or verbs 
""
When we move from words to sentences  there are certain
problems 
""
 on the
screen 
""
Each sentence consists of a few words  and many Indians try to
give equal emphasis 
""
For example  many Indians might read the first sentence like
this 
""
Whereas  you might
read it in some such way 
""
My friend has finished the job 
""
Listen again to the difference between the two 
""
My friend has finished the job 
""
And 
""
In the English sentence properly said  that
certain words 
""
In this sentence  are
""
""
The words my  are relatively unimportant
""
""
Listen to the sentence again  My friend has finished
the job 
""
Consider the next sentence 
""
""
""
Many Indians might read it as 
""
""
""
Compare this with 
""
""
""
Look at the first phrase 
""
Now you hardly hear 
""
I am not saying  the
machine  is relatively unimportant in
this sentence 
""
If you remember this simple fact  that
is  are usually more
important  auxiliary
verbs 
""
You will find that it will make a lot of difference to your speech
""
""
 at the
right places 
""
Because if you don't pause at the right place  you will find
that the sentence can convey a wrong meaning 
""
Many of us are also aware  of the necessity of using the right
tone 
""
""
""
The first sentence 
in a sense is not ambiguous 
""
The word  has one meaning here
""
it can convey different meanings 
""
I am going to say this sentence 
and listen carefully to the difference 
""
One 
""
Two 
""
""
I am sure you have heard  the difference between the three
sentences 
""
And  said
with three different tones  in English
""
""
""
""
Number one 
""
This is a matter of fact statement 
""
The speaker really appreciates  of the person
that he is talking about 
""
But if he says it with a different tone 
 you might perceive it as a
question  that the speaker wants to add something
after this 
""
This might convey 
""
Consider the third way  She is
beautiful 
""
This in English  indicates that there is some kind of implied
meaning 
""
This sentence  could
mean  or unreliable or
something like that 
""
So the praise  is not really unqualified
""
""
There is some kind of implied meaning  that the speaker is
trying to convey 
""
""
""
""
""
This sentence in isolation 
""
But if you use the right kind of tone  this can be perceived
as a request 
""
Let me point out  of making
requests in English 
""
You can add words like 
""
You can change the sentence construction and say 
Would you mind closing the door  May I ask a
favour of you  and then you ask the person to close the door
""
""
For example  between these two
sentences 
""
""
""
""
""
The first sentence is perceived as a strong command  whereas
the second one is seen as a polite request 
""
This indicates  that intonation or tone plays a very important
role 
""
A wrong intonation 
""
And this can cause a lot of misunderstanding 
""
As we said at the beginning  all of us would like to speak
fluently  that fluency means
fast speech 
""
This is not really right 
""
You can be slow in speed  because
fluency depends 
""
The speed must be controlled by what you are talking about  and
it is also directed 
to some extent 
""
Even if you take into account 
which we have discussed  and
that is confidence 
""
Unless you feel self- confident  you will not be able to make
significant progress 
""
Of course  your confidence must be supplemented by hard work
and patience 
""
At the end  the important
aspects of speech 
""
One 
""
Two 
""
Three  accenting
important words 
""
And lastly 
""
As I said 
and hard work 
""
Thank you
