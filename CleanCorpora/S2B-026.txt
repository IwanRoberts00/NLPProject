Hello viewers

English fluently

But many of us are unnecessarily diffident about it

effort  in the

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Every good dictionary 
""

immediately after the entry of the word  or

 given

""
""
""
We are aware  agreement

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If you put this together  agreement
""
""
You will find that there are about fifteen such strange looking
symbols 
""
And it is a matter of a few minutes  to get familiar with those
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the beginning 
""
""
""
""
symbols 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As we all know  and consonant sounds
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that gives you 
""
""
""
""
Listen again  pool
""
""
The contrast  and long
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
vowels and long vowels 
""

""
""
fan 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Instead of saying  they say
""
""
""
Have a close look at my lips now 
""
""
""
""
And you will observe  between the

""

Many Indians say 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The English pronunciation  the Indian
""
 thank
""
""
What really happens in the articulation of the English sounds is
""
comes out 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Many of us  and then to
""
""
This gives rise  as
""
""
Look at the next three words on the screen 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Many Indians think  m
""
""
And therefore they think  that the pronunciation must be
""
""
""
""
immediate 
""
""
ring 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In the British pronunciation  ga
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Before  you must have seen a short
""
what it was 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You will find that  the accent is
indicated 
""
Most of them  before the
""
""
 have a look at some of these words on the screen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Listen again  and you will
""
part 
""
""
""
""
It has been found out  by
the right accent 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore  that if the
""
couldn't be that word 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Again as I told you before  this word has another possible
""
""
In whichever way you pronounce it  the accent must be on the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
institution 
""
The correct pronunciation would be  I am an employee of this
""
""
The next word is an interesting case 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
first syllable 
""
When it is a verb  to the second
""
""
""
""
First of all  as a
""
""
He gave me a nice birthday present 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I hope you have listened to the two different pronunciations
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If they are nouns  there is usually accent on the first
syllable  there is usually accent on the second
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a verb 
""
""
""
""
""
The agricultural produce in India has gone up 
""
India produces a lot of wheat 
""
""
as nouns or verbs 
""
""
""
""
 on the
""
""
""
give equal emphasis 
""
For example  many Indians might read the first sentence like
""
""
""
read it in some such way 
""
""
""
""
""
My friend has finished the job 
""
And 
""
""
certain words 
""
In this sentence  are
""
""
""
""
""
Listen to the sentence again  My friend has finished
""
""
Consider the next sentence 
""
""
""
Many Indians might read it as 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I am not saying  the
""
""
""
""
""
important  auxiliary
""
""
""
""
""
 at the
""
""
Because if you don't pause at the right place  you will find
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The first sentence 
""
""
""
""
""
""
I am going to say this sentence 
and listen carefully to the difference 
""
One 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The speaker really appreciates  of the person
""
""
""
""
""
after this 
""
""
""
""
beautiful 
""
""
meaning 
""
""
mean  or unreliable or
something like that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if you use the right kind of tone  this can be perceived
""
""
Let me point out  of making
""
""
You can add words like 
""
""
Would you mind closing the door  May I ask a
""
""
""
For example  between these two
""
""
""
""
""
""
The first sentence is perceived as a strong command  whereas
the second one is seen as a polite request 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As we said at the beginning  all of us would like to speak
""
""
""
This is not really right 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which we have discussed  and
""
""
Unless you feel self- confident  you will not be able to make
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
Three  accenting
