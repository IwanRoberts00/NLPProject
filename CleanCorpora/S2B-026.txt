Hello viewers 
All of us are interested in developing the ability to speak
English fluently and expressively 
But many of us are unnecessarily diffident about it 
You will find that with a little guidance and constant
effort it's possible to make remarkable improvement in the
ability to speak English 
The aim of this programme is to highlight some of those
aspects of speech which contribute to better spoken English 
I am sure all of us refer to a dictionary whenever we don't know
the meaning of a word 
But we quickly have a look at the meaning and then close the
dictionary 
There is one important bit of information which we generally
don't use and that is pronunciation 
Every good dictionary gives the pronunciation of a word 
Whenever you refer to a dictionary you will find that
immediately after the entry of the word its pronunciation or
transcription is given in bracket 
 Let's have a look at one such transcription given
in the dictionary 
This word is to be pronounced as agreement
 
Listen carefully agreement 
We are aware that many of us say agreement
 and this pronunciation seems to be influenced by spelling
Look at the first symbol in this transcription 
It is rather a strange letter because that doesn't appear 
in the ordinary letters of the alphabet 
That sta stands for the sound
 IPA symbol the weak sound IPA symbol in English
The next three symbols give us the sound gree
 and the next four symbols give us the sound 
 ment 
If you put this together you get agreement
 
You will find that there are about fifteen such strange looking
symbols used in most dictionaries 
And it is a matter of a few minutes to get familiar with those
symbols 
You will find that once you know those symbols you will have
the ability to read the correct pronunciation given in a dictionary
Any dictionary gives a list of phonetic symbols right at
the beginning 
For example have a look at this table 
In this table you find that on the left there are some
symbols phonetic symbols as we call them 
Towards the right there are some words which point out
what are the sounds represented by those symbols 
If you go through this carefully you will find that in
fact you already know many of the symbols 
As I said there are only a few symbols that you will have
to try and remember 
Let us move on to one important aspect of speech 
As we all know there are vowel sounds and consonant sounds
 Let's consider two important vowel sounds 
First let's take up these words lip
 leap 
Listen carefully again to these two words lip
 leap 
You will find that there is difference in the vowel sound 
of these two words 
The first sound is a short sound the sound is i
 
The second one is a long sound i: and
that gives you lip leap 
Have a look at the next pair of words pull
 pool 
Listen again pull pool
 
The contrast is between short IPA symbol and long
 IPA symbol 
I would like to give you a simple hint 
In case of short vowels try to make your vowels as short as
possible 
And in case of long vowels try to make them as long as you can
This will help you retain the distinction between the short
vowels and long vowels 
 Let's briefly talk about some consonants which are
problematic to many Indian users of English 
 Let's have a look at the next pair of words 
fan finish 
Listen again fan finish
 
Many Indians have a problem in articulating the first sound
Instead of saying fan they say
 phan instead of saying finish 
 they say phinish 
Have a close look at my lips now 
The English sound is fa fan
 finish 
And you will observe that there is a contact between the
lower lip and the upper teeth 
Please observe again fan 
finish 
In the Indian equivalent you will find that there is a contact
between the two lips 
Look carefully pha 
Many Indians say phan 
phinish instead they should say fan
 and finish 
 Let's have a look at the next pair of words 
think and thank 
Again note carefully the first sound 
The first sound is IPA symbol and not 
tha 
Many Indians say think and thank
 
I hope you hear the difference between the English sound 
and the Indian equivalent 
Listen again to the difference 
The English pronunciation IPA symbols the Indian
pronunciation think the English pronunciation
 IPA symbols the Indian pronunciation thank
 
What really happens in the articulation of the English sounds is
 that the first sound in these words is a friction sound the air
comes out between the lower and the upper teeth 
Look again think thank 
And if you are a little aware of how these sounds are produced
 that will make a lot of difference to our spoken English 
We have to take one important piece of care 
Many of us are exposed to spelling first and then to
pronunciation 
This gives rise to what some people have described as
spelling pronunciation 
Look at the next three words on the screen 
The first word is immediate 
Some of you might wonder that this word has another possible
pronunciation immediate 
 That's right 
Some words in English have two or more acceptable
pronunciations 
This word is either IPA symbols - immediate or IPA
symbols - immediate but not IPA symbols - immediate 
Many Indians think that because there is double m
 in spelling there must be two IPA symbols sounds 
And therefore they think that the pronunciation must be
immediately 
But let's remember that there is only one m
 there and therefore the pronunciation is IPA symbols -
immediate or IPA symbols - immediate 
The next word is often pronounced by Indians as 
ring 
Listen again ring 
But the British pronunciation would be IPA symbols - rin
 
The difference is in the last sound 
In the British pronunciation there is no ga
 at the end 
 It's IPA symbols - ring and not IPA symbol -
ring 
Similarly in the next word it's not IPA
symbols - ringing but IPA symbols - ringing 
Again there is no ga 
There is a tendency to go by spelling and this is one
important piece of care that we'll have to take about
English pronunciation 
In the pronunciation that we showed you from the dictionary
 there was one mark which I didn't explain earlier 
Before g you must have seen a short
vertical stroke on top of the word and you might have wondered 
what it was 
In fact that is called the accent mark or the stress mark
Accent or stress is a very important feature of English speech
 and it has been proved that that lead to intelligibility of English
Between the correct articulation of vowels and consonants and
the correct accent what is definitely more important is the right
accent 
And therefore all of us should be bothered about this feature
 of English speech 
You will find that in any dictionary the accent is
indicated by certain kinds of strokes 
Most of them use a short vertical stroke before the
accented syllable 
 Let's have a look at some of these words on the screen
The first word is character 
Now this word is made up of three syllables or three parts 
 cha ric and ter
 
Remember that all these three parts are not said with equal
emphasis 
Listen again character and you will
find that I am emphasising I am somehow highlighting the first
part cha character 
I must not pronounce the word as character or character
 because this would be a shift in accent 
It has been found out that English is often understood by
the right accent 
And there has been an experiment an interesting one where
it was found that if Indians pronounce the word as character 
English speakers heard the word as director 
You might wonder why this happened 
Look at the next word on the screen and you'll find
 that that has accent on the second syllable 
Therefore the English listeners thought that if the
word character had accent on the second syllable it
couldn't be that word 
It has to be a word which has accent on the second syllable
And therefore they thought of the nearest word which has
accent on the second syllable 
In the word director there is accent on the second syllable
Again as I told you before this word has another possible
pronunciation you might pronounce it as director 
In whichever way you pronounce it the accent must be on the
second syllable 
 Let's have a look at the next word which is often
mispronounced by Indians employee 
There is accent on the third syllable neither on the first
syllable nor on the second but on the third employee
 
Whereas many of us tend to say I am an employee of this
institution 
The correct pronunciation would be I am an employee of this
organisation 
The next word is an interesting case 
All of us know this word and we know that this word
functions as a noun an adjective or a verb 
Depending on its grammatical role there is a change in accent
When it is a noun or an adjective there is accent on the
first syllable and therefore the pronunciation is present 
When it is a verb the accent shifts to the second
syllable and the pronunciation is present 
 Let's try to use this in sentences 
First of all the word present as a
noun 
He gave me a nice birthday present 
The word as an adjective thirty students were present in the
class yesterday 
The word as a verb we are going to present a play tonight
And I hope you have listened to the two different pronunciations
 of the same word 
The main difference was that of accent 
In English there are a few words pairs of nouns and verbs
 which behave in this particular way 
If they are nouns there is usually accent on the first
syllable and if they are verbs there is usually accent on the second
syllable 
 Let's consider one more example like this 
The next word on the screen is both a noun and a verb 
If it is a noun it can be pronounced as produce if it is
a verb it should be pronounced as produce 
And I hope you hear the difference in accent 
 Let's use these words in sentences 
The agricultural produce in India has gone up 
India produces a lot of wheat 
Therefore whenever we use words which can function either
as nouns or verbs we should be careful about the accent 
When we move from words to sentences there are certain
problems 
 Let's have a look at the next two sentences on the
screen 
Each sentence consists of a few words and many Indians try to
give equal emphasis on each word 
For example many Indians might read the first sentence like
this my friend has finished the job 
Whereas if you are a good speaker of English you might
read it in some such way 
My friend has finished the job 
Listen again to the difference between the two 
My friend has finished the job 
And my friend has finished the job 
In the English sentence properly said you will find that
certain words stand out as more prominent 
In this sentence the words that stand out as prominent are
 friend finished and job 
The words my has and the are relatively unimportant
 and therefore you can speak them faster and more weakly 
Listen to the sentence again My friend has finished
the job 
Consider the next sentence 
 The machine is being repaired 
Many Indians might read it as 
 The machine is being repaired 
Compare this with 
 The machine is being repaired 
Look at the first phrase the machine 
Now you hardly hear the article the 
I am not saying the machine but I am saying the
machine the is relatively unimportant in
this sentence 
If you remember this simple fact that content words that
is nouns adjectives adverbs and main verbs are usually more
important than words like conjunctions articles auxiliary
verbs 
You will find that it will make a lot of difference to your speech
 It's also necessary to have proper pauses at the
right places 
Because if you don't pause at the right place you will find
that the sentence can convey a wrong meaning 
Many of us are also aware of the necessity of using the right
tone or the right intonation 
 Let's have a look at the next two sentences 
The first sentence She is beautiful 
in a sense is not ambiguous 
The word beautiful has one meaning here
 but depending on the tone that you use in order to say this 
it can convey different meanings 
I am going to say this sentence in three different ways 
and listen carefully to the difference 
One She is beautiful 
Two She is beautiful and three 
 She is beautiful 
I am sure you have heard the difference between the three
sentences 
And you'll find that all these three sentences said
with three different tones convey three different meanings in English
 Let's consider their meanings 
Number one She is beautiful 
This is a matter of fact statement 
The speaker really appreciates the beauty of the person
that he is talking about 
But if he says it with a different tone as in number two 
 She is beautiful you might perceive it as a
question or you might think that the speaker wants to add something
after this 
This might convey the sense of incompleteness 
Consider the third way of saying that She is
beautiful 
This in English indicates that there is some kind of implied
meaning and that is left to the imagination of the listener 
This sentence She is beautiful could
mean okay she is beautiful but foolish or unreliable or
something like that 
So the praise the appreciation is not really unqualified
There is some kind of implied meaning that the speaker is
trying to convey 
 Let's consider the next sentence 
 Close the door 
This sentence in isolation is a command 
But if you use the right kind of tone this can be perceived
as a request 
Let me point out that there are different way of making
requests in English 
You can add words like please or kindly 
You can change the sentence construction and say 
Would you mind closing the door or May I ask a
favour of you and then you ask the person to close the door
 or a third possibility is to use the right tone 
For example listen to the difference between these two
sentences 
 Close the door 
 Close the door 
The first sentence is perceived as a strong command whereas
the second one is seen as a polite request 
This indicates that intonation or tone plays a very important
role in speech 
A wrong intonation can sometimes convey wrong meaning 
And this can cause a lot of misunderstanding 
As we said at the beginning all of us would like to speak
fluently and there is a common misunderstanding that fluency means
fast speech 
This is not really right 
You can be slow in speed and yet be fluent because
fluency depends on the kind of flow that your speech has 
The speed must be controlled by what you are talking about and
it is also directed it's also controlled by your personality 
to some extent 
Even if you take into account all these aspects of speech 
which we have discussed there is one extremely important thing and
that is confidence 
Unless you feel self- confident you will not be able to make
significant progress in spoken English 
Of course your confidence must be supplemented by hard work
and patience 
At the end let's try to sum up the important
aspects of speech to which we must pay attention 
One the correct articulation of vowels and consonants 
Two the right accent 
Three the right kind of rhythm depending on accenting
important words 
And lastly intonation 
As I said all these should be supplemented by confidence 
and hard work 
Thank you
