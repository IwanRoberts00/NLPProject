Respected Chairman distinguished guests and fellow
 delegates 
I would like to say at the outset I'm very much
illequipped paper reader 
Actually I didn't I was not aware of the change in the
schedule which was not really supplied to me yesterday I was one of
the first paper Readers put down 
But anyhow I am happy that I am able to read it read it out
today 
And taking into consideration the limitations of time usually in
such seminars I have jotted down some stray thoughts that too
on a known author well discussed by you 
Of course I am not a committed feminist or anything like that but
 based on my own reading I would like to share a few thoughts on
Sylvia Plath's poem 
Of course with a slight difference from the normally vaulted
 past adpoted by most of the major voices 
Uh the actually I struck upon this idea when I was
reading Yung in some another context 
And I had a feeling that uh perhaps uh Plath's 
insistance struggle or some sort of an obssession with the definition
or redefinition of self could be looked at from the complex concept
of sex as sorry of the individual in which two polarities the
male and female are combined 
But anyhow I have not made a very deep analysis of that problem
here 
But on the other hand I have taken up a few poems and try to
suggest why don't we look at this way and try to see a perhaps 
another major concern of Plath rather than labelling her as an out
and out feminist or a committed confessional poet or anything of
that sort
Perhaps I think one of the major problems which could still be
studied in relation to her poetry is the integrity of the self
 without being st strictly 
related to any gender 
Or the thrust of my paper which I have intend to elaborate
later on is to see that the concept of the self which could be perhaps
studied in relation to her poems could be quite free from the gender
concerns 
She takes into consideration the problems created by the male
 as well as the female in defining a self intact 
So with this introductory remarks I am reading my
paper 
The self in Sylvia Plath's plays it is different 
In a very general sense Sylvia Plath's poetry as a
whole has been an insistant search to find and define the self 
Though she is often labelled as a confessional poet in her
perception of the self and the poetic process she is quite different
from say Dorothy Robert Loyal John Berryman and
 Annie Saxon and the like 
She links private motives and images into sequences that
form the part of a coherent drama a symbolic enactment 
The approach adopted by her in the last poem about which I
am making some observations 
The last poem contained An aerial 
adventurous spirit throws in temporarily for highly individualistic and
peculiar perception of the self 
The victim sends feminist stance concessional strain 
and the suicidal mania gain relevance and meaning when one should
read to link these factors with her self or in other words herself
 with a difference 
 Plath's feminism her confessionalism and suicide are
to be seen in relation to her relentless poetic transformation 
An inevitable rebirth through death 
A hightened awareness of the individuals painful one word 
 in contemporary society becomes the central focus of
their I mean contemporary poet's poems 
 Plath's poetry of imit 
 of initiation transformation thus appears within its
general social framework as a means of escape from the identities and
forces that imprisoned the self in America or perhaps elsewhere
In the light of the developments in the post- nineteen sixty
context there is some scope for looking at Plath's work 
from a feminist point of view 
This view centres upon her supposed victimisation by a
male dominated world and her consequence feminist's stance
Lack of recognition in a male dominated world shocking
childhood experiences and the separation from her husband of
course these are all autobiographical factors which may or may not be of
relevance paranthetically might have contributed to shape her fury
 and even to unchange her true self 
Feminist views her death as a form of martyrdom 
Her life a case history in the devilish cultural politics 
that favours men over women and destroys women's creativity 
Actual biographical details of Plath's may not augment
this stance 
However because I think she had sufficient acclaim 
her poetry was fairly well ratified but in the particular time at
which she was writing say I think poetry was at a lower base 
I think even now it is applied 
When we list this one word I'm sure the
response will be much better when we discuss poetry probably the response
is limited because it shows on the one hand the readers' 
response response and I think poetry is not in great demand 
So that may not be something very peculiar to Plath 
However the distinguishing feature of Plath's self in
her poems particularly her later ones is that she looks at the world
from the point of view of an oppressed one not strictly gender bound 
In the last poems there is a rare fury a total release from
fear 
The recourse to a aggression in the last poem is neither
abreast nor aesthetically uncalled for 
I think if you make a total study of her poems beginning with her
earlier poems and if you come up to her very late poems this trend could
be seen 
This was some sort of a progressive release from the clutches
 of fear and which culminates in a sort of fury which I think
render possible the liberation of the self 
Of course we can cite poems belonging to both groups 
 I ci I quote a few lines from
 a poem which is usually quoted to cite her feminist strength in
 Pardah for example she makes a
declaration of independence I shall unloose from the small
jewelled form from the small jewelled doll she got like a heart 
the lioness the shriek in the barks the cloak of whole 
In another poem which is a longer poem Three Women
 
Through the voices of a wife a secretary and a girl she brings
to life the feminine sensibilities in relation to being an approved
mother with a son a woman with a miscarriage and a girl 
with an accidental daughter whom she gives away 
Here one would perceive the subtle variation that Plath effect
 to bring to the fore herself 
Perhaps even in this period of emotional fury and psychological
collapse she plucks at courage and pronounces rather forcefully 
I quote from Winter Tree I am
no shadow though there is a shadow starting from my feet I am a
wife 
The city waits and aches 
The little grasses cracked through stone and they are green
 with light 
This robust assertion on the elemental beauty of life 
green with life brings in the difference in Plath's self 
even while being one with a one word a feminist or 
a confessionist 
While looking at Plath's poem from a feminist point of
view one has to bear in mind two vital points 
One Sylvia Plath may not be a feminist as one is likely
to believe 
For she does not commit herself to ideological problems in her
writings 
If that is a major concern 
There is limited gender based class hatred in her poems to
my mind 
Time and again she directs her anger against select individuals
 her father her husband or their symbolic representatives 
Even the passages of a hot nature when I quote that we find in
a poem like Lady Lazarus further The
Applicant and Three Women may not be
sufficient evidence to argue that Plath had a committed well
defined feminist politics 
At best one could say that in such lines I quote from
 Daddy Her boss her Lucifer devour
devour out of the ash I write with my red hair and I eat men like
air 
 I'm sorry I've quoted these lines from 
 Lady Lazarus one word They are
 dancing and scanting jumping on you 
They always knew it was you 
Daddy daddy you bastard I am through 
Plath directed her rage against in the fantacy image of her
dead father and against her husband into an attack on marriage and
men or in a more inclusive way which I think maybe more 
beneficial against violence against total violence perhaps 
 With your permission to the audiance 
The strength of her mature poetry suddenly lies in her ability
to coilate polarities particularly the male female polarities 
Yielding a delicate or even diabolic of course it is
questionable balance in the human strain 
This aspect is borne out by her poems Lasposs
 Medusa and the other 
Really she lashes out with equal violence on women 
I quote Violent attacks on women in this well sort of
 not far and few 
This only points to herself with a difference 
In Lassposs she mocks any bounds
that exists between one woman and another as a result of their common gender
 or shared oppression 
I have quoted the poet herself 
I quote from one of her poem Your voice my earing
 flapping and sucking blood loving bath that's that 
that's that you peer from the doors sad had every woman is a
whore I can't communicate 
So I think her problem of defining the self or her problem of
establishing a camaraderie is not strictly regimented to or confined
to the men 
But on the other hand she has been more or less undergoing this
dramatic experience in relation to women also which I think critics have
not very often taken into serious consideration 
 That's my feeling 
It may be noted that one of her recurrent images of for 
women is the Medusa image which I think is not a very
enduring one 
Plath unlike the later feminist never struck to any particular
ideology in relation to male female conflicts or what we have now
begun to term as even the male female crisis 
Depending on the poetic situations she shifted her views on the
male female issues 
For her the prime concern is the integrity of herself 
Perhaps the difference in her perception and hence her self
lies in her existencial streak 
I think I'll be in agreement with previous paper reader
She strikes again the male and female with equal venom and
vehemence whenever they irrespective of the gender become a
threat to her self 
Plath discusses a consciousness of political issues but the
focus of her politics was neither women nor men's role in 
women's oppression 
As she explained in a B B C interview 
I quote She was imaginatively involved in those
historical political events that are closest to the concerned voice in
her poems 
She herself has listed a number of concerns Hiroshima atom
bomb one word and Nazism which again points to her
protest against the general violence total violence rather than the
violence impeached on women by men strictly 
The sequence of her late poems The bee keeper's
 daughter is quite revealing in this sense 
In a way it anticipates the Lady Lazarus mood 
The crux of the sequence in a quest is a quest for an
independent queenly self 
The first poem the The Bee Meeting just
describes the usual practice of replacing old hives 
But it soon becomes an awful ritual for the protagonist 
for it is directed by I quote dreary depersonlised 
a one word like figures of a midwife a rector and a sexton
 as they are also agents respectively of birth marriage and death
 
The poem turns out to be the first step in a cyclic exploration
of the self 
Curiously these agents are protected 
But the protagonist is utterly exposed 
I quote nude as a chicken neck 
unquote 
However the mood of aggression asserting the peculiar strength
of her self is sustained in the arrival of the Bee-box and stings
The end of the Rabbit catcher another good poem to be looked at
from this point of view clearly suggest the constraints set by 
the man in personal relationships maybe a male female relationship
 maybe a male say a female female relationship 
Obviously here too she is concerned with the integrity of the
self 
She abhors I quote And we two had a relationship
 tight wire between us 
Takes too deep to approve and a mind like earring sliding
shut on some quick sand 
The constrict the constriction killing me also 
two words 
Even in this way the difference in her self is reflected in
her persistance on themes relating to children and rebirths in the
poems of her last phase 
Sylvia Plath's confessional mood and mood is a
designed to bring forth the peculiarities of herself 
 Morning Song Nick and the Candletick Death and
Company Cuts the Bee-Meeting Tulips etcetera are some
poems which enable us to go far beyond mere autobiographical
revealations 
These poems record I quote Personal experience in
the patterns that obtain an objective character of though repetition
 illusion and symbolic inactment 
Unquote Plath right from the beginning to the end in her
creative essay has been experimenting with the integrity of the self 
I underline the integrity of the self through a series of
emotionally charged even hyper charged explorations by her feminist
concerns confessional overtures suicidal leaps and through her
bold linguistic innovations she could present a self with a
difference to the reading public 
Thank you
