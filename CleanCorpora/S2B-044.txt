Respected Chairman  and fellow
""
""
I would like to say at the outset  very much
illequipped paper reader 
""
Actually I didn't  change in the
schedule  I was one of
the first paper Readers put down 
""
But anyhow I am happy that I am able to  read it out
today 
""
And taking into consideration  the limitations of time usually in
such  that too
on a known author well discussed by you 
""
Of course I am not a committed feminist or anything like that but
 I would like to share a few thoughts on
Sylvia 
""
Of course with a slight difference  from the normally vaulted
""
""
Uh the actually  when I was
reading Yung in some another context 
""
And I had a feeling that uh 
insistance  with the definition
or redefinition of self  the complex concept
of sex as  two polarities the
male and female are combined 
""
But anyhow I have not made a very deep analysis of that problem
here 
""
But on the other hand I have taken up a few poems  and try to
suggest why don't we look at this way 
another major concern of Plath  an out
and out feminist  or anything of
that sort
""
Perhaps I think one of the major  problems which could still be
studied  of the self
""
related to 
""
Or the thrust of my paper  elaborate
later on is  to see that the concept of the self which could be perhaps
studied  could be quite free from the gender
concerns 
""
She takes into consideration the problems created  by the male
""
""
So with this  reading my
paper 
""
The self in Sylvia 
""
In a very general sense Sylvia  as a
whole has been 
""
Though she is often labelled as a confessional poet  in her
perception  she is quite different
from  and
""
""
She links private motives  into sequences that
form the part of a coherent drama 
""
The approach adopted by her  about which I
am making some observations 
""
The last poem 
adventurous spirit  throws in temporarily for highly individualistic and
peculiar perception of the self 
""
The victim sends 
and the suicidal mania  when one should
read to link these factors  or in other words herself
""
""
 are
to be seen in relation to her relentless 
""
An inevitable rebirth through death 
""
A hightened awareness of the individuals painful 
 of
their I mean contemporary 
""
""
 thus appears within its
general social framework  from the identities and
forces  or perhaps elsewhere
""
""
In the light of the developments in the post- nineteen sixty
context 
from a feminist point of view 
""
This view centres upon her supposed  by a
male dominated world  stance
""
""
Lack of recognition  shocking
childhood experiences  of
course these are all autobiographical factors  which may or may not be of
relevance  might have contributed to shape her fury
""
""
Feminist 
""
Her life 
that favours men over women 
""
Actual biographical details of  may not augment
this stance 
""
However 
her poetry was  but in the particular time at
which she was writing say 
""
I think even now it is applied 
""
When we list this  the
response will be much better  when we discuss poetry probably the response
is limited because 
response 
""
So that may not be something very peculiar to Plath 
""
However  self in
her poems particularly her later ones  is that she looks at the world
from the point of view of an oppressed one 
""
In the last poems there is a rare fury  a total release from
fear 
""
The recourse to  aggression in the last poem is neither
abreast 
""
I think if you make a total study of her poems beginning with her
earlier poems and if you come up to her very late poems  this trend could
be seen 
""
This was some sort of a progressive release  from the clutches
 which I think
render possible 
""
Of course we can cite poems belonging to both groups 
""
 a few lines from
 feminist strength in
 she makes a
declaration of independence  from the small
jewelled form 
the lioness 
""
In another poem which is a longer poem  Three Women
""
""
Through the voices of a wife a secretary and a girl  she brings
to life the feminine sensibilities in relation to being  an approved
mother 
with an accidental 
""
Here one would perceive  the subtle variation that Plath effect
""
""
Perhaps even in this period of emotional fury  and psychological
collapse 
""
I quote  I am
no shadow  I am a
wife 
""
The city waits and aches 
""
The little grasses  and they are green
""
""
This robust 
green with life 
even while being one 
a confessionist 
""
While looking at  poem from a feminist point of
view one has to bear in mind two vital points 
""
One  may not be a feminist as one is likely
to believe 
""
For she does not commit herself to  ideological problems in her
writings 
""
If that is a major concern 
""
There is limited gender based  to
my mind 
""
Time and again she directs her anger  against select individuals
""
""
Even the passages of a hot nature when I quote  that we find in
a poem like  The
Applicant  may not be
sufficient evidence  well
defined 
""
At best one could say  I quote from
 devour
devour  and I eat men like
air 
""
""
 They are
""
""
They always knew it was you 
""
Daddy 
""
Plath  directed her rage against in the fantacy image of her
dead father  into an attack on marriage and
men 
beneficial 
""
""
""
""
The strength of her mature poetry  suddenly lies in her ability
to coilate polarities 
""
Yielding a delicate  or even diabolic of course it is
questionable 
""
This aspect is borne out by her poems  Lasposs
""
""
Really she 
""
I quote  Violent attacks on women in this well sort of
""
""
This only points to herself with a difference 
""
In  any bounds
that exists between one woman and another as a result of their common gender
""
""
I have quoted 
""
I quote from one of her poem  my earing
""
that's  is a
whore 
""
So I think her problem of defining the self or her problem of
establishing a camaraderie  or confined
to the men 
""
But on the other hand she has been  more or less undergoing this
dramatic experience in relation to women also  which I think critics have
not very often taken into 
""
""
""
It may be noted that one of her recurrent images of 
women  is not a very
enduring one 
""
Plath unlike the later feminist  never struck to any particular
ideology  or what we have now
begun to term as 
""
Depending on the poetic situations  she shifted her views on the
male female issues 
""
For her the prime concern 
""
Perhaps  the difference in her perception and hence her self
lies in her existencial streak 
""
I think  be in agreement with previous paper reader
""
""
She strikes again the male and female  with equal venom and
vehemence  become a
threat to her self 
""
Plath discusses  but the
focus of her politics was neither women nor 
women's 
""
As she explained in a B B C interview 
""
I quote  She was imaginatively involved in those
historical political events  that are closest to the concerned voice in
her poems 
""
She herself has listed a number of concerns  atom
bomb  her
protest against the general violence total violence  rather than the
violence 
""
The sequence of her late poems  keeper's
""
""
In a way it anticipates the Lady Lazarus mood 
""
The crux of the sequence in a quest  a quest for an
independent queenly self 
""
The first poem the  just
describes the usual practice of replacing old hives 
""
But it soon becomes an awful ritual 
for 
a  a rector and a sexton
 respectively of birth marriage and death
""
""
The poem turns out to be  the first step in a cyclic exploration
of the self 
""
Curiously 
""
But the protagonist is utterly exposed 
""
I quote 
unquote 
""
However the mood of aggression  asserting the peculiar strength
of her self  stings
""
""
The end of the Rabbit catcher  another good poem to be looked at
from this point of view 
the man in personal relationships  a male female relationship
""
""
Obviously here too she is concerned  with the integrity of the
self 
""
She abhors  And we two had a relationship
""
""
Takes too deep to approve  sliding
shut on some quick 
""
The constrict 
two words 
""
Even in this way  the difference in her self is reflected in
her persistance on  in the
poems of her last phase 
""
Sylvia  is a
designed to bring forth the peculiarities of herself 
""
 Death and
Company  etcetera are some
poems  which enable us to go far beyond mere autobiographical
revealations 
""
These poems record  in
the patterns  though repetition
""
""
Unquote  in her
creative essay 
""
I underline the integrity of the self  through a series of
emotionally charged  by her feminist
concerns  and through her
bold linguistic innovations  with a
difference 
""
Thank you
