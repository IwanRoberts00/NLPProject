Respected Chairman  and fellow
""
""
I would like to say at the outset  very much
""
""
""
""
the first paper Readers put down 
""
But anyhow I am happy that I am able to  read it out
""
""
And taking into consideration  the limitations of time usually in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
or redefinition of self  the complex concept
""
male and female are combined 
""
""
here 
""
""
suggest why don't we look at this way 
""
""
that sort
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
studied  could be quite free from the gender
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The self in Sylvia 
""
In a very general sense Sylvia  as a
""
""
""
""
from  and
""
""
She links private motives  into sequences that
form the part of a coherent drama 
""
The approach adopted by her  about which I
""
""
The last poem 
""
""
""
""
""
read to link these factors  or in other words herself
""
""
 are
""
""
An inevitable rebirth through death 
""
""
 of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
childhood experiences  of
course these are all autobiographical factors  which may or may not be of
relevance  might have contributed to shape her fury
""
""
Feminist 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think even now it is applied 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fear 
""
The recourse to  aggression in the last poem is neither
""
""
I think if you make a total study of her poems beginning with her
""
be seen 
""
This was some sort of a progressive release  from the clutches
""
render possible 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the lioness 
""
In another poem which is a longer poem  Three Women
""
""
""
""
""
with an accidental 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The city waits and aches 
""
The little grasses  and they are green
""
""
This robust 
""
even while being one 
""
""
While looking at  poem from a feminist point of
""
""
""
""
""
For she does not commit herself to  ideological problems in her
""
""
If that is a major concern 
""
""
my mind 
""
""
""
""
""
a poem like  The
Applicant  may not be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Plath  directed her rage against in the fantacy image of her
""
""
beneficial 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yielding a delicate  or even diabolic of course it is
questionable 
""
This aspect is borne out by her poems  Lasposs
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This only points to herself with a difference 
""
""
""
""
""
I have quoted 
""
I quote from one of her poem  my earing
""
that's  is a
whore 
""
""
""
""
""
""
dramatic experience in relation to women also  which I think critics have
""
""
""
""
""
women  is not a very
""
""
Plath unlike the later feminist  never struck to any particular
""
begun to term as 
""
Depending on the poetic situations  she shifted her views on the
male female issues 
""
For her the prime concern 
""
Perhaps  the difference in her perception and hence her self
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
threat to her self 
""
Plath discusses  but the
focus of her politics was neither women nor 
""
""
""
""
I quote  She was imaginatively involved in those

""
""
The sequence of her late poems  keeper's
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The first poem the  just
""
""
But it soon becomes an awful ritual 
""
""
 respectively of birth marriage and death
""
""
""
of the self 
""
Curiously 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The end of the Rabbit catcher  another good poem to be looked at
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
shut on some quick 
""
The constrict 
""
""
""
""
poems of her last phase 
""
""
designed to bring forth the peculiarities of herself 
""
""
""
poems  which enable us to go far beyond mere autobiographical
""
""
""
the patterns  though repetition
""
""
""
creative essay

I underline the integrity of the self  through a series of

concerns  and through her
bold linguistic innovations  with a
