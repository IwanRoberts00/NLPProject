The ground water 
""
I was talking about  the rain water which enters which falls on
the surface of the earth  is distributed in three ways
""
Now can you tell me the three ways in which it is distributed 
""
Yes Naresh ?
""
""
Uh  it
percolates 
""
""
 ?
""
""
Uh  when it falls on the ground
""
""
Yes  ?
""
What happens to it ?
""
""
It gathers into ponds
""
""
Correct 
""
""
And it falls as rain
""
""
Sit down 
""
Which is the other one  ?
""
""
Miss it is evaporated 
""
""
Okay
""
It evaporates 
""
Third one  ?
""
Which is the third way in which  the rain water is
""
""
It goes underground 
""
""
Okay he said it goes underground
""
""
On slopes the streams are formed 
""
""
Correct 
""
""
""
""
Good afternoon sir  addressed to another teacher who came
in 
""
""
""
""
""
Sit down 
""
So which is the third way ?
""
It flows down the slope  to form a
river 
""
So the three ways in which the rain water  falls
on the surface of the earth is distributed 
""
First thing it is 
""
Second one  streams to join
to form a river 
""
And the third one is 
surface of the earth 
""
Now the third one  inside the
earth  what would you call it ?
""
""
""
""
""
Well 
""
""
Okay well 
""
But where are these wells  ?
""
 the water in the
well  ?
""
""
Ground
""
""
Correct 
""
That is underground water 
""
So  how this
""
""
How this underground water is useful to man 
""
Now  underground water you know the water percolates inside the
earth 
""
But it is not the same  on every part of the
surface 
""
It is going to be different and it depends 
factors 
""
Now  I told you about how water
falls are formed 
""
Okay  ?
""
And we were talking about the structure of the earth 
""
Now suppose we take a mountain 
""
This is 
""
As I told you yesterday the waterfall 
you have 
""
""
""
""
""
What do you mean by non-permiable  ?
""
""
In which the water doesn't percolate
""
""
Correct 
""
Because  not
porous the water 
""
Now  it gets
as you told me goes inside 
""
Now where is this water going to settle  ?
""
Yes ?
""
""
It goes under ground
""
""
Where do you mean  ?
""
What do you mean by ?
""
""
At the base
""
""
Correct 
""
Somewhere here 
""
Is it not ?
""
Now this part is going to form what you call as  the water
table 
""
Is it not ?
""
This part where the water  is settled down is called as a water
table 
""
 amount of
water 
""
Can you tell me what would it depend on  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Correct the amount of rainfall 
""
Now 
high rainfall the water is going to  more
inside
""
Anything else ?
""
""
Nature of the soil inside the water table
""
""
Correct the nature of the soil 
""
Excellent answer 
""
Where esle  ?
""
What all  ?
""
Third one yes  ?
""
""
Inside the earth
""
""
Loudly please 
""
""
Inside the earth 
""
""
Correct he said  he said the same thing the nature of the
soil 
""
""
Structure or level of
""
""
Level of the water table
""
Okay 
""
He is given a different answer but that is also
""
Sometimes what happens  mountain may
have two  water table
""
You know two 
non-permiable  like in the cases I told you
about 
""
Now here the waterfall is going to be above 
""
There are going to be two different waterfalls 
""
This 
water table 
""
Is that understood  ?
""
Now which  the water table
the amount of water is going is going to depend on  ?
""
""
Level of the ground 
""
""
Okay the level of the ground 
""
What else  ?
""
Loudly
""
please close the door 
""
""
Size of the mountain
""
""
Size of the mountain
""
Anything else  ?
""
See  big
place not a very 
uh how would you define a mountain  ?
""
Yes Naresh ?
""
""
The area of high altitude with steep slopes to the land
""
""
Correct
""
Now what is the second point you said was steep slope 
""
Is it not  ?
""
Nahid 
""
Now this area is going to continue 
""
If  ?
""
Yes uh  ?
""
""
The circulation will be easy
""
""
The circulation would be easy of what  ?
""
Anybody else  ?
""
Sit down 
""
Yes Kabra  ?
""
""
The water is sloped down 
""
""
Okay and what would happen ?
""
Continue with that now what ?
""
""
The water is percolated
""
""
Correct  the slopes some you know more steep
you would have more water getting inside the water table 
""
So these are the various  the waterfall
""
""
Something else ah
""
Now 
""
How do rain  ?
""
On what do they depend on  ?
""
""
The amount of water evaporated
""
""
Correct 
""
Evaporation
""
Correct
""
Something else  ?
""
Good point when something else related to that  yes Ballal ?
""
""
There is there more water
""
""
Okay
""
What happens where where which are the regions where you would
have  ?
""
You know more more rains  to be more precise
""
Yes ?
""
""
The slope of the mountain
""
""
Correct 
""
Something else ?
""
""
It is actually  which is uh
""
""
Okay 
""
""
And then
""
""
""
""
""
Miss uh 
""
""
Okay now next 
""
All the points  hilly region
 okay hilly regions
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  ?
""
""
From the sea 
""
""
Sea okay
""
 getting you know
""
""
Trees
""
""
Correct 
""
Excellent
""
Where there is more vegetation  because of the leaves attract
the water as a more scientific reason 
""
You would have  more rainfall there
because of the trees
""
So vegetation is the point 
""
The other is 
""
Yes  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
Now these are the various  factors on which the water
table  is formed
""
Now what does this water table  why is it used ?
""
How is it used  ?
""
How does man use this water table ?
""
Can you think  ?
""
How does the man  how does man use this water table ?
""
""
By taking water from the well
""
""
Correct  in the form of well
""
Yes ?
""
""
By digging canals 
""
""
Its inside 
""
Yes ?
""
""
Wells
""
""
Okay wells of different type 
""
Now  and we have
heard in various  read in
newspapers and we just know through our general knowledge 
we cannot 
""
Now can you tell me why is it so ?
""
""
Underground
""
""
Underground ?
""
""
Springs are there
""
""
Okay
""
He says underground springs exist
""
We will talk about what is a spring afterwards
""
""
Some places are uh weak 
""
""
Okay very weak but something else you know
""
""
Water is not getting in
""
""
Correct yes 
anything
""
""
The area is non-permiable
""
""
Yes  non-permiable
""
Yet  then you
have water table and where it is easy for the man to dig 
""
""
You know where the water table is high and exist  possible for
man to 
""
Now in Maharashtra you have  under Konkan coast Tapi Purna
basin
""
Other various areas where  a lot of wells are found because of
the water table 
""
Now can you tell me why in the Sahyadri  ?
""
The reason is very obvious 
""
In the hilly region  because of excessive rainfall and it may
have  you may
have 
""
Somebody said  that the wells are dug in areas where there are
springs 
""
Now how would you define  ?
""
You know what a spring is ?
""
Everybody likes to go to Lonavala  ti
 and waterfalls
also 
""
Now how would you describe a spring  ?
""
Yes ?
""
""
The water which uh  slope underground falls from a head
""
""
""
We did something like that way  it is similar definition
""
""
What was that  ?
""
A waterfall  and
a spring 
""
""
Ground water is  the ground water
""
""
You can see on uh tap also 
""
Is it not  ?
""
How would you differentiate between a spring a tap and a waterfall
 ?
""
""
The underground water coming out with force
""
""
Correct 
""
Underground water comes out with force 
""
It is a natural outflow of water  from the interior of the
earth 
""
Now  ?
""
Can you just link up whatever we did till now and try to tell me
the answer 
""
Yes Bilwa  ?
""
""
The water table and
""
""
Loudly Bilwa  ?
""
""
There are water table and the
""
""
Okay
""
 water table and the
earth crust is weak 
""
So 
""
Where you have 
""
Now suppose 
""
Now the water this is 
""
""
The water is coming out 
""
And you would have 
""
So spring is the natural outflow of water  some from the
interior of the earth where the crust is weak 
""
Now the springs are of different types 
""
Springs
""
Suppose there is a cavity you know there is she said the crust is
weak
""
Now suppose if there is a cavity here 
""
You know what a cavity is  ?
""
What is a Cavity  ?
""
""
Empty space
""
""
Yes ?
""
""
Empty space
""
""
Empty space 
""
Okay  you see here
""
Where is this term used mostly  ?
""
Where have you heard this term  ?
""
""
Dental problem
""
""
Dental problem 
""
Cavity is with all the people 
""
Everybody all of us like eating sweets and we develop what you
call as  a cavity
""
Is it not ?
""
So  the
structure of the earth the mountain or any place 
""
Like a mouth  having a cavity
""
Now when the rain water falls on the surface  what is going to
happen ?
""
""
There it store water
""
""
Correct  all the water might get inside and get stored
here 
""
And suppose there is a crack due to  you would
have a spring coming out 
""
Now this spring  cycle spring
""
""
A cycle spring 
""
Where there is a cavity  in the you know in
interiors  get stored and due to some crack
or erosion of some kind the water comes out  to
form a spring and that kind of spring is called as a cycle spring 
""
Now from the spring we will go to something which I was telling
you yesterday  because of the structure of the
earth and because of the various minerals found in the earth  you have
beautiful structures underground caves formed somewhere 
""
Now I will show you 
""
You know 
""
Now suppose there is  which is
 got a lot of lime in it
""
Lime stone structure  limestone
""
How uh how  you know how
would you call that uh  ?
""
The 
""
Now H two O is carbon uh water you say
""
How  ?
""
""
Calcium
""
""
Give me in alphabets
""
""
C A C O three
""
""
Okay 
""
If an area has got a lot of C A C O three as you say  what
would happen ?
""
How does this dissolve ?
""
This does not dissolve in water alone 
""
You have some
""
Yes ?
""
""
Carbon di-oxide
""
""
Correct 
""
The carbon di-oxide which is 
you know join the uh 
weakens the limestone structure  erosion
takes place 
""
And this area where this surface of the earth where limestone
structure is in dominant  is a dominant rock structure we would call it as
a limestone 
""
Limestone 
""
Or 
""
It is also called as a 
""
 cast
""
""
It is a name of a district in Yugoslovia 
""
It is got which is  prominent rock structure is the limestone
structure 
""
That is why 
topography 
""
Now as I told you erosion takes place with when C A C O three 
mixed and the water which you have carbon di-oxide 
uh  and having
dis
""
Now  BB-Work
""
gorges 
""
Now  years together you have very
beautiful structure forming then 
""
Now 
and sometimes what happen when the limestone dissolves with the water some
part of the the lime 
""
Others get  and a
very small millimeter of 
""
Is that understood  ?
""
Similar structure will take place at the  at the
surface 
""
A small structure may remain here or the other water  which has
lime 
""
Now this  you know
""
Millions of years  particles
remaining behind 
""
Now this is called as 
""
Stalag  t i t e
s  stalactites
""
Now for you this is very confusing
""
How or how you are going to remember which is stalactite and which
is stalagmite stalagmite  stalagmite ?
""
I will tell you something to remember 
""
Mite 
""
Due to some extent  ?
""
On the surface 
""
So stalagmites are on the ground  on the
""
