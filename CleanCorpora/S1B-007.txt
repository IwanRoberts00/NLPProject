The ground water 
I was talking about the rain water which enters which falls on
the surface of the earth is distributed in three ways
Now can you tell me the three ways in which it is distributed 
Yes Naresh ?
Uh first it percolates uh means uh it
percolates 
 Where does it percolate ?
Uh when it falls on the ground
Yes ?
What happens to it ?
It gathers into ponds
Correct 
And it falls as rain
Sit down 
Which is the other one ?
Miss it is evaporated 
Okay
It evaporates 
Third one ?
Which is the third way in which the rain water is
It goes underground 
Okay he said it goes underground
On slopes the streams are formed 
Correct 
 Slopes down the slope the streams are formed 
Good afternoon sir addressed to another teacher who came
in 
 Sit down sit down 
Sit down 
So which is the third way ?
It flows down the slope to the river to form a
river 
So the three ways in which the rain water which falls
on the surface of the earth is distributed 
First thing it is eva some part of it evaporate 
Second one it flows into small streams streams to join
to form a river 
And the third one is that it percolates inside into the 
surface of the earth 
Now the third one which the water percolates inside the
earth forms what we'll call as what would you call it ?
 To the river 
Well 
Okay well 
But where are these wells ?
 Where does where is the water in the
well ?
Ground
Correct 
That is underground water 
So today we are going to study about the work how this
 of underground water BB-Work 
How this underground water is useful to man 
Now underground water you know the water percolates inside the
earth 
But it is not the same throughout on every part of the
surface 
It is going to be different and it depends on various 
factors 
Now yesterday we were doing I told you about how water
falls are formed 
Okay ?
And we were talking about the structure of the earth 
Now suppose we take a mountain 
This is the base noise 
As I told you yesterday the waterfall has underneath it 
you have permiable non-permiable 
 Non-permiable 
What do you mean by non-permiable structure ?
In which the water doesn't percolate
Correct 
Because the surface is hard and because it's not
porous the water cannot get inside 
Now when the rain water is falling on the surface it gets
as you told me goes inside 
Now where is this water going to settle ?
Yes ?
It goes under ground
Where do you mean ?
What do you mean by ?
At the base
Correct 
Somewhere here 
Is it not ?
Now this part is going to form what you call as the water
table 
Is it not ?
This part where the water is settled down is called as a water
table 
 Now this now this amount of
water in this water table would depend on various factors 
Can you tell me what would it depend on ?
 One or two words 
Correct the amount of rainfall 
Now wherever er those areas which have 
high rainfall the water is going to be more in percolate more
inside
Anything else ?
Nature of the soil inside the water table
Correct the nature of the soil 
Excellent answer 
Where esle ?
What all what are the other points ?
Third one yes ?
Inside the earth
Loudly please 
Inside the earth 
Correct he said he said the same thing the nature of the
soil 
Structure or level of
Level of the water table
Okay sometimes 
He is given a different answer but that is also
Sometimes what happens that er uh mountain may
have two water table
You know two in the in a 
non-permiable wa structures like in the cases I told you
about a waterfall 
Now here the waterfall is going to be above 
There are going to be two different waterfalls water tables 
This wat kind of water table is called as perched 
water table 
Is that understood ?
Now which is the other point on which the water table
the amount of water is going is going to depend on ?
Level of the ground 
Okay the level of the ground 
What else ?
Loudly
please close the door 
Size of the mountain
Size of the mountain
Anything else ?
See the top of the mountain the tip is not a very big
place not a very you know it's it's got it has 
uh how would you define a mountain ?
Yes Naresh ?
The area of high altitude with steep slopes to the land
Correct
Now what is the second point you said was steep slope 
Is it not ?
Nahid 
Now this area is going to continue 
If the slope is steep what will happen ?
Yes uh Mukesh ?
The circulation will be easy
The circulation would be easy of what ?
Anybody else ?
Sit down 
Yes Kabra ?
The water is sloped down 
Okay and what would happen ?
Continue with that now what ?
The water is percolated
Correct the the slopes some you know more steep
you would have more water getting inside the water table 
So these are the various aspects on which the waterfall
 the water table depends 
Something else ah
Now let's go back to our very basic 
How do rain fall ?
On what do they depend on ?
The amount of water evaporated
Correct 
Evaporation
Correct
Something else ?
Good point when something else related to that yes Ballal ?
There is there more water
Okay
What happens where where which are the regions where you would
have more water ?
You know more more rains to be more precise
Yes ?
The slope of the mountain
Correct 
Something else ?
It is actually two words which is uh
Okay 
And then
 You're coming somewhere near 
Miss uh the water get deposit 
Okay now next 
All the points you hilly regions hilly region
 okay hilly regions
 Hilly regions hilly region 
Yes ?
From the sea 
Sea okay
 You're getting you know
Trees
Correct 
Excellent
Where there is more vegetation because of the leaves attract
the water as a more scientific reason 
You would have what is called as more rainfall there
because of the trees
So vegetation is the point noise 
The other is evaporation 
Yes ?
 One or two words 
Okay afterwards 
Now these are the various fa factors on which the water
table is formed
Now what does this water table why is it used ?
How is it used ?
How does man use this water table ?
Can you think ?
How does the man how does man use this water table ?
By taking water from the well
Correct in the form of well
Yes ?
By digging canals 
Its inside 
Yes ?
Wells
Okay wells of different type 
Now we see now we have seen in various movies and we have
heard in various documentory we have heard in we've read in
newspapers and we just know through our general knowledge that uh 
we cannot you know dig a well any way which you like 
Now can you tell me why is it so ?
Underground
Underground ?
Springs are there
Okay
He says underground springs exist
We will talk about what is a spring afterwards
Some places are uh weak 
Okay very weak but something else you know
Water is not getting in
Correct yes or they may be to be more precise 
anything
The area is non-permiable
Yes non-permiable
Yet some wherever vary where those regions then you
have water table and where it is easy for the man to dig you may have 
 what wells 
You know where the water table is high and exist possible for
man to find dig for a well 
Now in Maharashtra you have under Konkan coast Tapi Purna
basin
Other various areas where a lot of wells are found because of
the water table is even in the Sahyadri 
Now can you tell me why in the Sahyadri ?
The reason is very obvious 
In the hilly region because of excessive rainfall and it may
have the structure of permiable and non-permiable rocks you may
have well there 
Somebody said that the wells are dug in areas where there are
springs 
Now how would you define a spring ?
You know what a spring is ?
Everybody likes to go to Lonavala for holidays rainy ti
 season specially and you see a lot of springs and waterfalls
also 
Now how would you describe a spring ?
Yes ?
The water which uh slope underground falls from a head
We did something like that way it is similar definition
What was that ?
A waterfall there is a difference between a waterfall and
a spring 
Ground water is one word the ground water
You can see on uh tap also 
Is it not ?
How would you differentiate between a spring a tap and a waterfall
 ?
The underground water coming out with force
Correct 
Underground water comes out with force as she said 
It is a natural outflow of water from the interior of the
earth 
Now where does this water come out from ?
Can you just link up whatever we did till now and try to tell me
the answer 
Yes Bilwa ?
The water table and
Loudly Bilwa ?
There are water table and the
Okay
 They were there are water table and the
earth crust is weak 
So there are the regions where you have waterfalls 
Where you have something called a spring BB-Work 
Now suppose here there is a crack or a weak structure 
Now the water this is the whole the whole 
 water table 
The water is coming out 
And you would have what you would term as a spring 
So spring is the natural outflow of water some from the
interior of the earth where the crust is weak 
Now the springs are of different types 
Springs
Suppose there is a cavity you know there is she said the crust is
weak
Now suppose if there is a cavity here 
You know what a cavity is ?
What is a Cavity ?
Empty space
Yes ?
Empty space
Empty space 
Okay a kind of a hole you see here
Where is this term used mostly cavity ?
Where have you heard this term ?
Dental problem
Dental problem 
Cavity is with all the people 
Everybody all of us like eating sweets and we develop what you
call as a cavity
Is it not ?
So suppose similarly the now take imagine the
structure of the earth the mountain or any place BB-Work 
Like a mouth having a cavity
Now when the rain water falls on the surface what is going to
happen ?
There it store water
Correct all the water might get inside and get stored
here 
And suppose there is a crack due to erosion you would
have a spring coming out 
Now this spring it may be termed as uh cycle spring
A cycle spring 
Where there is a cavity in the earth in the you know in
interiors you would have the water get stored and due to some crack
or erosion of some kind the water comes out through some outlet to
form a spring and that kind of spring is called as a cycle spring 
Now from the spring we will go to something which I was telling
you yesterday as a continuation that because of the structure of the
earth and because of the various minerals found in the earth you have
beautiful structures underground caves formed somewhere 
Now I will show you suppose there is an area 
You know earth consist of maleable minerals 
Now suppose there is this surface of the earth which is
 which's got a lot of lime in it
Lime stone structure limestone
How uh how how would you what is the you know how
would you call that uh the scientific name for it ?
The I don't know how to tell you that 
Now H two O is carbon uh water you say
How uh how would you call limes ?
Calcium
Give me in alphabets
C A C O three
Okay BB-Work somebody said C A C O three 
If an area has got a lot of C A C O three as you say what
would happen ?
How does this dissolve ?
This does not dissolve in water alone 
You have some
Yes ?
Carbon di-oxide
Correct 
The carbon di-oxide which is in the air and which 
you know join the uh is mixed with the rain water makes it to 
weakens the limestone structure and make a lot of depressions erosion
takes place 
And this area where this surface of the earth where limestone
structure is in dominant is a dominant rock structure we would call it as
a limestone topa topography 
Limestone topography 
Or for you to know something more about BB-Work 
It is also called as a cast topography 
 Cast topography it is taken from the word cast
It is a name of a district in Yugoslovia 
It is got which is prominent rock structure is the limestone
structure 
That is why it is also called as termed as a cast 
topography from its name of the district cast in Yugoslavia 
Now as I told you erosion takes place with when C A C O three 
mixed and the water which you have carbon di-oxide leads to dis 
uh leads to limestone dissolving with water and having
displaced small kind of depression 
Now small this may be termed as a pot hole BB-Work
 a bigger one may be termed as a as gorges to termed as 
gorges 
Now if this continuous say years together you have very
beautiful structure forming then 
Now this you know this the limestone dissolving this water 
and sometimes what happen when the limestone dissolves with the water some
part of the the lime remains behind 
Others get you know it washes away with the water and a
very small millimeter of lime is remained there 
Is that understood ?
Similar structure will take place at the base at the
surface 
A small structure may remain here or the other water which has
lime is washed away 
Now this goes on for years you know
Millions of years small small limestones particles
remaining behind and they have been given different term 
Now this is called as stalagmite 
Stalag mite the other is the stalactites t i t e
s stalactites
Now for you this is very confusing
How or how you are going to remember which is stalactite and which
is stalagmite stalagmite which is stalagmite ?
I will tell you something to remember 
Mite something to do with mice it rhymes with it 
Due to some extent mice where is it found ?
On the surface 
So stalagmites are on the ground stalactites are on the
 ce ceiling
