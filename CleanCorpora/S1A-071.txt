<I>
Well Ranju we will talk about the procedure of the con 
 uh conduction conduct of B S R B exam 
Yes let it be we'll talk about that 
What idea we have uh how we are called for the ex 
exam 
First of all the board will uh give an advertisement in the
paper and full information will be given in that advertisement such as
eligibility criteria time duration and the date of conduction
 etcetera conduct 
Uh what are the different kinds of text that are to be test
in the exam ?
Uh there are four kinds of tests in the exam mainly uh test
of English language uh English comprehens comprahensive 
clerical aptitude numerical ability and test of reasoning 
Uhm I will tell you about the uh test of English language
firstly 
In that we'll in that English language include 
uh e du spotting the error uh completion of
sentences rearrangement of sentences etcetera 
Spotting the error means uh in that we have to find out an error
 uh which one is the mistake we have to find out and uh answer it
whether it is right or wrong 
And in completion of the sentences uh the appropriate word
should be selected and filled up in the blank 
And uh rearrangement of sentences should be done accordingly
Uh well next comes the test of reasoning in that uh 
 three topics are 
 In the English language 
In the En English language you are having a passage also
no ?
Yes we have passage also 
Uh amo from the passage questions will be asked and
 uh 
 Like 
Like uh the passage will be given and then from that
passage we have to write the answers and uhm they will 
one word 
 They will ask questions for you ?
Yes 
Uh questions also include the words like this synonyms and
antonymns etcetera from the passage only they have to chose the synonymns
and antonymns and uh write accordingly 
Uh secondly I want to tell you about the reasoning ability 
It includes series uh analogies and classification 
Uh series is uh uh comparatively it is difficult from the other
two that is analogies and classifications 
In series uh two figures will be given such as problem figures
and uh answer figures 
Uh in problem figures four or five figures will be given 
and from that we have to chose the succeeding figure from the answer
figures 
We have to chose the correct one 
The questions include such as they will ask that is they
will ask uhm uh we have to compare them accordingly 
We have to compare them uh according to the clockwise direction
 ante-clockwise direction whether it is the figure is uh in the
left direction or in the right direction etcetera 
And in analogies uh it it is also same 
It is also same as the series 
In analogies problem figures and answer figures will be given
We have to compare the first two figures of the problem figure
 and the third unit should be found out from the answer figures 
 haan 
And uh nextly next comes the
classification in the in which we have we have to find the odd man out
Okay then what the what ideas are you having about the
clerical aptitude ?
Uhn 
As as far as my knowledge is concerned I know that uh four
addresses will be given
Yes of course uhn you are right
 Uhn 
Four address addresses is it is
correct na 
Yeah
Four addresses will be given 
You have to chose uh the in a problems uh problem part 
there will be given one address you have to chose exactly the same
address out of those five options yes you have to chose
 na 
And you've you have to tick off it
 Yes 
Tick off the right one
Hey what is the procedure of uh answering the
questions in uh in this exam 
Will you tell me about that that
 Which 
Well the answer figure also co means in the questions
we have five optionals for each questions
Uhm
Totally we'll be having two hundred questions for
four test you know 
One test consist consists of fifty
questions
And totally you'll be having two hundred questions 
In answer paper also for two hundred questions in front of each
uh means each answer you will be given five oval 
And in question paper you will be given optionals no in uh
which one is the right opt uh which one is the right one no you
have to uh darken the oval in the answer in the answer paper 
Uh so which one you find correct you should have you should
darken the oval particular oval
Uhm
And if you want to change the answer you should
completely erase the oval 
Uhm 
If you want to change otherwise no you have to completely
erase the oval 
You should not uh leave uh means there
Any sign
Yes uh because the answer papers you know they will be
feeded under into the computers you know
Yeah
So they will be fully erased they should be fully
erased off
And you should darken a new oval 
And if you want to uh if you do not have to you do not have
the time to erase also you should cross the oval 
Uh you should put a cross mark on the oval and you have to give
the correct answer 
Our total time duration will be given uh ninety-five 
ninety no 
It should be divided eq eq yes in a
certain manner
 Ninety-five 
 Yes 
Yes
It should be divided orderly
Of course
First you have to solve English language and then you have to
solve reasoning ability
Uhm
Then thirdly you have to solve this numerical
ability 
 No I think you are wrong 
Secondly you shou you should solve the numerical ability
Ah
Means ma calculation should be finished off you
know first only
Yeah
Because uh after after means reasoning after you try
after reasoning uh you'll be you'll get some difficulty
in solving the numerical ability uhm because the
calculation sometimes will uh they will be difficult
 Uhm 
The time allotted will be yes uh of uh
ninety-five minutes in that you should divide yeah four
