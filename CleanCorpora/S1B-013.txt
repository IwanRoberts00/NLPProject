""
""
So what is a regular solid  ?
""
A regular solid is one in which  and angles are
""
""
""
""
""
""
Can you observe here ?
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
All sides and angles are equal
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
So what is the name of this figure  ?
""
What is the name of this solid ?
""
""
Prism prism
""
""
Yes  prism
""
""
Prism 
""
""
Now observe this 
""
So here  top
""
""
Top 
""
""
This is base  height
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The lateral faces
""
""
Lateral faces
""
""
Now see this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And now the shape of  base and
lateral faces are different 
""
Shape of 
""
""
""
""
""
Now compare these 
""
What is the shape of the lateral faces ?
""
""
Rectangular rectangular
""
""
Rectangular 
""
""
""
""
""
And compare to what is it ?
""
""
Rectangular
""
""
Compare the  top and the base
""
""
Base 
""
""
What is the name of this one ?
""
""
Square
""
""
Square base  ?
""
Now  top as well as what is it the lateral faces
 ?
""
""
Which  ?
""
""
Top as well as 
""
Are these perpendicular to one another ?
""
""
""
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
No sir 
""
""
Lateral faces and  are
""
""
""
""
""
""
Understood  ?
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
So such a  figure or such a solid is known as what does it
is ?
""
""
Prism 
""
""
And here this figure that is prism  ?
""
""
Six faces
""
""
Six faces
""
""
Sir Shailaja patil 
""
""
Here this 
face
""
Therefore this is called 
""
And  three
lateral faces 
""
Understood  ?
""
So here what is the shape of the lateral face  ?
""
""
Rectangle
""
""
Rectangle  face
""
And shape of the top of the 
""
""
""
""
""
Triangle bases
""
So this  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
Do you know how to find the surface area  ?
""
Or do you know how to find the  ?
""
""
Yes
""
""
How do you find the area of a rectangle  ?
""
""
Half base into height
""
""
Area of a rectangle
""
""
Length into breadth
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And how do you find the area of a square  ?
""
""
Side into side side into side
""
""
Side into  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now see here
""
How to find  prism ?
""
In order to find what is its total surface area  what we should
do  ?
""
Total surface area  the area
of  rectangle
""
""
""
""
""
That is of one shape 
""
Similarly you can find the area of this shape
""
Similarly you can find  the area of this shape
""
Means we can find the areas of quadrilateral lateral faces 
""
And we can also find what is it is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So total surface area means what  ?
""
Total surface area ?
""
Now we can calculate the  of what
is it each face 
""
But to uhm find the what is total surface area  ?
""
It means what we have to do  ?
""
We have to find the we have to  find the sum of the what is it
is 
""
So total surface area include  the area of what is it is the
lateral faces 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now here we have the what is it is model 
""
Model of the 
""
Understood  ?
""
Can you prepare  a model of this type ?
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
So you can cut out the shape of a prism 
""
Now here  prism
""
And 
""
When you open it up what happens  ?
""
You will get what is it is 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Do you get the figure of this kind or not ?
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Suppose here the length of the what is it is 
""
""
Prism
""
""
The length of the what is it is
""
""
Prism 
""
""
Rectangle
""
""
Rectangle
""
""
Taking the rectangle 
""
Length of the rectangle is  and its
breadth is 
""
""
""
""
""
Now here do you see that part  ?
""
Do you find that it is a  big rectangle ?
""
""
They are not the same 
""
""
And here what are these ?
""
""
Square 
""
""
Yes what are these actually ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
So it means we want to find what is the total surface area of the
prism 
""
To find the total surface area of the prism what we have to do  ?
""
We have to find and we have to add  the surface areas of these
lateral  ?
""
""
The base is
""
""
The area of the top and the 
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
So  of
prism  and
base  plus area of
""
""
""
""
""
Rectangle 
""
""
Area of
""
""
Lateral faces 
""
""
Four rectangles
""
""
Four rectangles  four rectangle
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
So area of top and bases
""
These two have the shape of a 
""
Therefore what you can write here ?
""
Area of base  because these two have what is
it is 
""
These two squares have same area 
""
Plus what is it is area of four rectangle 
""
Now compare here 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
That is same length  and they have same breadth that is A
centimetre 
""
Understood  ?
""
So area of four rectangles 
area of 
""
Area of a 
""
""
""
""
""
Now how do you find the area of a rectangle here  ?
""
And how do you find the area of a square ?
""
Just find out this one 
""
So what is the  ?
""
""
Side into side
""
""
Side into 
""
""
""
""
""
So here area of  but the bases
have the what is it shape of  therefore what is the
formula here  ?
""
""
Side into side
""
""
What is the side of the square ?
""
""
A
""
""
A
""
""
A
""
""
A square 
""
""
A
""
""
Therefore  into two is equal to what
you can write 
""
""
""
""
""
Plus 
""
""
""
""
""
Sir four
""
""
Four 
""
Now find the area of a rectangle
""
How do you find the area of a rectangle  ?
""
We require length and 
""
""
""
""
""
So what is the length of the rectangle here ?
""
""
H
""
""
H centimetres  and breadth of the
""
""
A 
""
""
So it is  breadth
""
""
Breadth 
""
""
Understood  ?
""
Now here 
""
Four into 
""
""
""
""
""
Four into A means what it gives us  ?
""
""
Four A square 
""
""
Four into A 
plus A  means what is it ?
""
""
Four A square
""
""
What is it  ?
""
""
A length
""
""
Yes  A
""
""
A
""
""
This is  this is A
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You are adding A 
""
""
""
""
""
It means what it gives you  ?
""
""
Four A 
""
""
Breadth of four triangles 
""
""
Length of 
""
""
Breadth of four triangles 
""
""
Not breadth man
""
Sit down 
""
That is called as perimetre 
""
This is the perimetre uhm 
""
Perimetre means what  ?
""
Sum of the sides 
""
Sum of the sides
""
Do you know that ?
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
So here we can do what is it sum of the sides of this 
base
""
""
Base
""
""
So four A means what is it is  two A square plus four A
 into what is it base
""
""
Base 
""
""
So two A square means what is it  area of the
base  perimetre
""
""
""
""
""
""
Perimetre 
""
""
Height 
""
""
Height of what is it  ?
""
""
Prism
""
""
Height of the 
""
It is as well as height of the 
""
""
""
""
""
Height of the prism 
""
So will you solve an example now  ?
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
So  model example that is given
here 
""
Find the total surface area of a prism with 
in which the side of  four centimetres and height
""
""
So what is given in this problem I shall write here  just here
""
""
""
""
Find the total surface area 
prism  in which the
side of the square is  six
centimetres 
""
Yes what is given in the problem  ?
""
""
Side and height
""
""
Side of the what is it is  square base and height of the
""
""
Then what we have to find here  ?
""
""
Total surface
""
""
Total surface area 
""
Now here  to
calculate what is it is 
""
""
""
""
""
So what is the formula to  calculate the total surface
area of the prism  ?
""
Two  area of the base plus perimetre of the base
""
""
Simple
""
""
""
""
""
Height into height plus base 
""
""
So substitute these values in your what does it is 
formula 
""
So total surface area  total surface
area is equal to  ?
""
""
Two  area of square
""
""
Area of the 
""
""
""
""
""
How do you calculate area of the base  ?
""
""
Four into four 
""
""
Has he given the  side of the base ?
""
""
Yes sir yes
""
""
Here 
""
What is the length of this one ?
""
""
Four centimetres
""
""
If this is four  can you calculate the area of this base ?
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
How do you calculate it  ?
""
""
Side into side 
""
""
""
""
Area of the  is equal to what is it is
""
what is it 
centimetres 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So here two into area of the base
""
What is the area of the base  ?
""
""
Sixteen square centimetres
""
""
""
""
Square 
perimetre of the base 
""
So how do you find  ?
""
""
""
""
""
That is nothing but what is it 
""
So here how do you find  ?
""
Sum of the sides of what is it is 
""
So what is the  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Four plus four 
""
""
""
""
Sixteen
""
""
So here we can calculate and what is it is all the sides or
you can also multiply the side of the  four
""
So what is the  ?
""
""
Four A four 
""
""
What is the length of the ?
""
""
Four  four
""
""
Four centimetres
""
""
""
So four into 
""
""
""
""
""
And what is the  ?
""
""
Three
""
""
Three
""
""
Height of the prism is  six centimetres
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now solve this one 
""
Here two into  centimetres
""
""
""
""
""
Thirty-two 
""
""
""
""
""
Square centimetres plus 
""
 plus what is it is ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Twenty-two 
""
""
Twenty-two  so
""
""
Fifty-four 
""
""
Fifty 
""
""
""
