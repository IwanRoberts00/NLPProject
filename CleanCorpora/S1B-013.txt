Yes  prism
""
""
Prism 
""
""
Now observe this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Lateral faces
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And now the shape of  base and
lateral faces are different 
""
Shape of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Square base  ?
""
Now  top as well as what is it the lateral faces
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
So such a  figure or such a solid is known as what does it
""
""
""
Prism 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Six faces
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  three
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rectangle  face
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Triangle bases
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or do you know how to find the  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Length into breadth
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Side into  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is of one shape 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So total surface area means what  ?
""
""
""
""
is it each face 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Understood  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You will get what is it is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rectangle
""
""
Rectangle
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Square 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it means we want to find what is the total surface area of the
prism 
""
To find the total surface area of the prism what we have to do  ?
""
We have to find and we have to add  the surface areas of these
""
""
""
The base is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
prism  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Area of
""
""
Lateral faces 
""
""
Four rectangles
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore what you can write here ?
""
""
it is 
""
""
""
Plus what is it is area of four rectangle 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
centimetre 
""
Understood  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And how do you find the area of a square ?
""
Just find out this one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
formula here  ?
""
""
Side into side
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now find the area of a rectangle
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now here 
""
Four into 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Four A square 
""
""
Four into A 
plus A  means what is it ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A
""
""
This is  this is A
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Perimetre means what  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Do you know that ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
base
""
""
""
""
""
So four A means what is it is  two A square plus four A
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
base  perimetre
""
""
""
""
""
""
Perimetre 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So will you solve an example now  ?
""
""
""
""
""
So  model example that is given
""
""
Find the total surface area of a prism with 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Find the total surface area 
""
""
centimetres 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Side of the what is it is  square base and height of the
""
""
Then what we have to find here  ?
""
""
Total surface
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
