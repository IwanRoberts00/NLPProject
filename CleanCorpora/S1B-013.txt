Now we want to find what is it is surface area 
Do you know how to find the surface area ?
Or do you know how to find the area of a rectangle ?
Yes
How do you find the area of a rectangle ?
Half base into height
Area of a rectangle
Length into breadth
 Length into breadth 
 Length into breadth 
And how do you find the area of a square ?
Side into side side into side
Side into side because all the sides are equal in
 square 
 Square 
Now see here
How to find the surface area of what is it is prism ?
In order to find what is its total surface area what we should
do ?
Total surface area here we can find what is it is the area
of rectangle rectangle
 Rectangle 
That is of one shape 
Similarly you can find the area of this shape
Similarly you can find the area of this shape
Means we can find the areas of quadrilateral lateral faces 
And we can also find what is it is areas of top as well as 
 base 
 Base 
So total surface area means what ?
Total surface area ?
Now we can calculate the what is it surface area of what
is it each face 
But to uhm find the what is total surface area ?
It means what we have to do ?
We have to find the we have to find the sum of the what is it
is areas of all these faces 
So total surface area include the area of what is it is the
lateral faces as well as the area of what is it top and base 
 Base 
Now here we have the what is it is model 
Model of the prism 
Understood ?
Can you prepare a model of this type ?
Yes sir
So you can cut out the shape of a prism in cardboard 
Now here see you have what is it is prism
And you have prepared what is it model and open it up 
When you open it up what happens ?
You will get what is it is figure of this prism 
Yes sir 
Do you get the figure of this kind or not ?
Yes sir 
Suppose here the length of the what is it is 
Prism
The length of the what is it is
Prism 
Rectangle
Rectangle
Taking the rectangle 
Length of the rectangle is eight centimetres and its
breadth is A centimetres 
 A centimetres 
Now here do you see that part ?
Do you find that it is a big rectangle ?
They are not the same 
And here what are these ?
Square 
Yes what are these actually ?
 Top and the base 
 Top 
 Base 
Right 
So it means we want to find what is the total surface area of the
prism 
To find the total surface area of the prism what we have to do ?
We have to find and we have to add the surface areas of these
lateral fa faces plus what is it ?
The base is
The area of the top and the base 
 Base 
Right 
So total BB Writing surface area area of
prism is equal to what is it is area of top and
base plus area of
 And base 
Rectangle 
Area of
Lateral faces 
Four rectangles
Four rectangles four rectangle
Yes sir 
So area of top and bases
These two have the shape of a square 
Therefore what you can write here ?
Area of base into two because these two have what is
it is same area 
These two squares have same area 
Plus what is it is area of four rectangle 
Now compare here all the rectangles have same height 
Yes sir 
That is same length and they have same breadth that is A
centimetre 
Understood ?
So area of four rectangles what you can write four into 
area of a rectangle 
Area of a rectangle 
 Rectangle 
Now how do you find the area of a rectangle here ?
And how do you find the area of a square ?
Just find out this one 
So what is the formula to find the area of a square ?
Side into side
Side into side 
 side 
So here area of base these are base but the bases
have the what is it shape of what is it square therefore what is the
formula here ?
Side into side
What is the side of the square ?
A
A
A
A square 
A
Therefore area of base into two is equal to what
you can write two into A square 
 Two into A square 
Plus four 
 Two 
Sir four
Four 
Now find the area of a rectangle
How do you find the area of a rectangle ?
We require length and breadth 
 breadth 
So what is the length of the rectangle here ?
H
H centimetres and breadth of the
A 
So it is length into what is it is breadth
Breadth 
Understood ?
Now here two into A square plus four into A 
Four into A 
 A 
Four into A means what it gives us ?
Four A square 
Four into A four A's are here A plus A 
plus A plus A means what is it ?
Four A square
What is it ?
A length
Yes what is the length of this side A
A
This is A this is A this is A
 A 
 A 
You are adding A four times 
 Four times 
It means what it gives you ?
Four A four uh four A 
Breadth of four triangles 
Length of 
Breadth of four triangles 
Not breadth man
Sit down 
That is called as perimetre 
This is the perimetre uhm 
Perimetre means what ?
Sum of the sides 
Sum of the sides
Do you know that ?
Yes sir
So here we can do what is it sum of the sides of this 
base
Base
So four A means what is it is two A square plus four A
 into what is it base
Base 
So two A square means what is it two into area of the
base BB Writing base plus plus four perimetre
 Plus four 
Perimetre of the base into height BB close 
Height 
Height of what is it ?
Prism
Height of the prism 
It is as well as height of the rectangle 
 Rectangle 
Height of the prism 
So will you solve an example now ?
Yes sir 
So let's see the model example that is given
here 
Find the total surface area of a prism with square base 
in which the side of the square base is four centimetres and height
 six centimetres 
So what is given in this problem I shall write here just here
 Blackboard work 
Find the total surface area surface area of a prism 
prism with a square base with a square base in which the
side of the square is four centimetres and height six
centimetres BB work end 
Yes what is given in the problem ?
Side and height
Side of the what is it is square base and height of the
 prism is given 
Then what we have to find here ?
Total surface
Total surface area 
Now here we've derived what is formula to
calculate what is it is total surface area of the prism 
 Prism 
So what is the formula to calculate the total surface
area of the prism ?
Two into area of the base plus perimetre of the base
Simple
 Into area of the base plus perimetre of the base 
Height into height plus base 
So substitute these values in your what does it is 
formula 
So total surface area BB work begin total surface
area is equal to BB work end what is given ?
Two area of square
Area of the base 
 Base 
How do you calculate area of the base ?
Four into four 
Has he given the side of the base ?
Yes sir yes
Here 
What is the length of this one ?
Four centimetres
If this is four can you calculate the area of this base ?
Yes sir
How do you calculate it ?
Side into side 
 BB work begin 
Area of the base is equal to what is it is
 four into four that is equal to sixteen 
what is it square centimetres square 
centimetres BB work end 
 Base 
 Four into four 
 Sixteen 
 Square centimetres 
 Centimetres 
So here two into area of the base
What is the area of the base ?
Sixteen square centimetres
 BB work begins 
Square centimetres BB work end plus 
perimetre of the base 
So how do you find perimetre ?
 Centimetres 
That is nothing but what is it sum of the sides 
So here how do you find the perimetre ?
Sum of the sides of what is it is base 
So what is the length of this base ?
 Four centimetres 
 Four centimetres 
Four plus four plus four plus four 
 Plus four plus four 
Sixteen
So here we can calculate and what is it is all the sides or
you can also multiply the side of the square by four
So what is the length of the side here ?
Four A four 
What is the length of the ?
Four four
Four centimetres
 BB work begins 
So four into four 
 Four 
And what is the height of the prism ?
Three
