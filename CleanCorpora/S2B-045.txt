Hello  going to
""
""
There have been many wonderful discoveries by scientists  to make
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to us  it is in our mind
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
It does not come to you when you try to get it 
""
""
""
""
Just think about it 
""
""
""
""
""
He gets it but he is not satisfied 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A boy wants a bicycle 
""
His father gives him one 
""
He sees someone with a 
""
""
""
""
Then he wants a motor car 
""
If he has enough money to buy one he wants another  and a bigger
""
""
""
""
""
The wisest men in the world  have taught us that the only
""
""
It is difficult for us to be like that 
""
But nevertheless  more does
""
""
That is why most people are not happier today  even with many
""
""
""
""
""
Science has helped us to get rid of many sickness of the body 
""
""
""
""
""
""
We have learnt of  the many discoveries made by scientists to
""
""
""
""
lenghtened the life of the average man 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that people were less happy in those times
""
""
What is the use  what is the use of living longer
unless you are also happy  ?

are using them badly 
""
For example  and of
""
""
In ancient times men could wound and kill each other only if they
""

""
Even in the battles of the olden times  which history calls
""
a few thousand men 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
single man  in a few minutes
""
""
""
""
""
hundreds of thousands of people immediately  if it was dropped on a big
""
""
The scientists  weapons are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
o 
""
The same country  could be used only for useful
""
""
Explosives are not harmful  if they are used for such purposes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Unless you can find it out  there will be more and more terrible

Thank you once again

On the world scene on one hand India can stand proudly shoulder to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
illiteracy can be a major handicap for the growth and development of
""
""
In this context functional literacy  becomes all the more
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Literacy teaching is resolutely oriented towards development 
and should be an integral part of not only of any national educational plans
 all sectors of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
few more specific situations 
""
""
""
""
""
""

sector  is also in need of access

Yet another important segment of the society is the rural artisans

In the social background

And if a person is literate  he

Thus literacy in a sense is not a dose which can produce instant

It can  through though

These few words of mine add up to the inevitability of total

Thank you
