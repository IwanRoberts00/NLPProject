Hello  going to
speak 
""
There have been many wonderful discoveries by scientists  to make
our lives 
""
But if we ask the question  Have these discoveries made
men happier  ?
""
It is difficult 
""
The chief difficulty in giving a true answer is because 
 which can be given
to us  it is in our mind
""
""
Just think carefully 
""
If you get something which pleases you  the happiness is not in
the thing 
""
There is another point about 
which is also worth thinking about 
""
Happiness does not depend upon the amount of things you have 
""
It does not come to you when you try to get it 
""
On the contrary it depends on the fewer  fewness of your wants
""
""
Just think about it 
""
A man who has 
""
He wants one thing and tries to get it 
""
He gets it but he is not satisfied 
""
He wants something else 
""
The more he gets 
""
Is not that true  or
high position  ?
""
Most people are like that 
smaller things 
""
A boy wants a bicycle 
""
His father gives him one 
""
He sees someone with a 
""
""
When he is a little older he wants a motor cycle 
""
Then he wants a motor car 
""
If he has enough money to buy one he wants another  and a bigger
one 
""
But a man who has few wants  has
a much better chance of being happy 
""
The wisest men in the world  have taught us that the only
complete happiness 
""
It is difficult for us to be like that 
""
But nevertheless  more does
not make us happier 
""
That is why most people are not happier today  even with many
wonderful and useful new things that science has discovered and given us 
""
Some of the things which science has given us have certainly helped
""
""
Science has helped us to get rid of many sickness of the body 
""
That is a great thing 
""
It is difficult to be happy in your body  is
full of pain 
""
We have learnt of  the many discoveries made by scientists to
make us painless and to get rid of the cause of pain and sickness 
""
By making it possible to cure terrible diseases such as malaria
 science has
lenghtened the life of the average man 
""
In nineteen hundred every baby born in the U S A  could be
expected to live less than fifty years 
""
Fifty years later the health conditions  have so much improved
that the average length of life 
""
A few hundred years ago the average length of life  was less
than thirty years 
""
""
 that people were less happy in those times
 ?
""
What is the use  what is the use of living longer
unless you are also happy  ?
""
Science is helping man to produce much more food from the earth
""
""
By this it is helping to prevent famine  and sickness due to
undernourishment 
""
It has also made it possible to send quick relief  to places
where there is shortage of food and medicines  with the help of motor uh
motor lorries 
""
This is also very good and many lives are saved in such ways 
""
But in India and some other countries such as Indonesia  and
South America  is increasing faster than than the
food supply 
""
Science has not yet 
""
It is  very serious because there will be worse and worse
famine 
""
And people certainly cannot be happy 
can they  ?
""
There are also many discoveries of science which have definitely
brought 
""
That is not  but because men
are using them badly 
""
For example  and of
other explosives 
""
In ancient times men could wound and kill each other only if they
were near enough to strike each other with stones  spears or
swords 
""
Even in the battles of the olden times  which history calls
great battles  only of
a few thousand men 
of those times 
""
In most wars  except a few such as the wars which destroyed the
Roman Empire 
even when the armies were fighting a few miles away 
""
But the invention of fire arms and high explosives  caused a
great change 
""
A modern machine gun  worked by a
single man  in a few minutes
""
""
One modern bomb can kill thousands 
""
It is said that the latest type of 
hundreds of thousands of people immediately  if it was dropped on a big
city 
""
The scientists  weapons are
not wicked men 
""
They are people with kind hearts  but
they are more clever  and they can earn their living by discovering new
things 
""
It is the leaders of the various nations  who employ them to
make discoveries 
o 
""
The same country  could be used only for useful
purposes if the leaders did not allow them 
""
Explosives are not harmful  if they are used for such purposes
as helping to get coal 
""
The same motors and aeroplanes  which are used to carry guns and
drop bombs 
""
So you see that it is not the discoveries and inventions that are
bad 
""
Now let us try to find out why men use them  for harmful
purposes 
""
It is not easy to find this out 
""
Unless you can find it out  there will be more and more terrible
wars in your  and if we go on like that our
grand-children 
""
The earth will become a desert and mankind will come to an end 
""
With these few words I end my speech 
""
Thank you for giving me an oppotunity to speak 
""
Thank you once again 
""
""
""
Hello  uh speaking
 inevitable
 economic development of a country
""
""
On the world scene on one hand India can stand proudly shoulder to
shoulder with frontline countries 
advanced technology etcetera 
""
But in literacy queue we are far behind other countries 
""
 well known world over that the areas of poverty and
illiteracy  in a map and continued
illiteracy can be a major handicap for the growth and development of
democratic institution in a country 
""
In this context functional literacy  becomes all the more
significant and important 
""
Mere  is of no
consequence 
""
Rather than an end in itself  literacy should be regarded as a
way of preparing man for social and civil and economic role 
""
Literacy teaching is resolutely oriented towards development 
and should be an integral part of not only of any national educational plans
 all sectors of
national life 
""
Considering the experience of many other countries  the targets
fixed by  educational planners are by no means beyond
realisation 
""
 analyse the need for our relevance of literacy in a
few more specific situations 
""
There are very prejudices facts and  which frown
upon literacy  its strength
""
Let us start with the example of industrial workers 
""
An Industrial worker in  organised
sector  is also in need of access
to information about the source of raw material  and its conversation to
""
rate fixation process  at
the work place etcetera 
""
A belief that  thus an illiterate worker can also successfully
operate machines  and
maintain them is nothing but 
of a blind prejudice 
""
A worker in the  sector
is in need of  access to
information about various process  improved farming
 to a particular crop quality of
seeds fertilisers and other modern methods 
""
The malfunctional middlemen  who rob the legitimate share of the
farm and the forest produce 
""
The plight of the share croppers  of the landless agricultural
labourers  which lead to
their indebtness and bondage will be improved to a very great extent 
""
Yet another important segment of the society is the rural artisans
""
""
They should also wake up from their traditional slumber and look
around them and the world 
""
They must look beyond the crude and antiquited ways of making goods
""
""
Example of 
should leave his old slumber  switch on to new electric arc
furnace etcetera
""
The potter to electric wheels 
""
In the social background 
 uh depends mostly on literating the
woman 
""
It helps in warding off the superstition and other social evils too
""
""
Woman  and strength
and weakness herself 
""
No more she is what we say in Sanskrit  Koop Manduke
""
""
And even in the political situation the voting right of a person
is 
""
And if a person is literate  he
cannot 
political 
""
They can fight for the rights to a greater extent 
""
Thus literacy in a sense is not a dose which can produce instant
and dramatic results 
""
It can  through though
powerful which gradually trains and equips some  human mind and prepares
it 
""
These few words of mine add up to the inevitability of total
literacy 
""
Thank you
