Hello I'm Meenakshi V today I'm going to
speak on the topic Science and Happiness 
There have been many wonderful discoveries by scientists to make
our lives more comfortable more safe and more interesting 
But if we ask the question Have these discoveries made
men happier ?
It is difficult to give a true answer 
The chief difficulty in giving a true answer is because 
 happiness is not a material thing which can be given
to us like food or motor or a radio set it is in our mind
Just think carefully and you will see that this is so 
If you get something which pleases you the happiness is not in
the thing but in your mind which finds the thing pleasurable 
There is another point about happiness 
which is also worth thinking about 
Happiness does not depend upon the amount of things you have 
It does not come to you when you try to get it and keep it 
On the contrary it depends on the fewer fewness of your wants
Just think about it this also carefully 
A man who has many wants always wants more 
He wants one thing and tries to get it 
He gets it but he is not satisfied 
He wants something else 
The more he gets the more he wants 
Is not that true of most people who want wealth or power or
high position ?
Most people are like that even if their wants are for 
smaller things 
A boy wants a bicycle 
His father gives him one 
He sees someone with a be better 
 bicycle so he wants one like that 
When he is a little older he wants a motor cycle 
Then he wants a motor car 
If he has enough money to buy one he wants another and a bigger
one and so on 
But a man who has few wants whether he is poor or rich has
a much better chance of being happy 
The wisest men in the world have taught us that the only
complete happiness is when one wants nothing 
It is difficult for us to be like that 
But nevertheless it is true that merely having more does
not make us happier 
That is why most people are not happier today even with many
wonderful and useful new things that science has discovered and given us 
Some of the things which science has given us have certainly helped
 to make our lives happier 
Science has helped us to get rid of many sickness of the body 
That is a great thing 
It is difficult to be happy in your body if your body is
full of pain 
We have learnt of the many discoveries made by scientists to
make us painless and to get rid of the cause of pain and sickness 
By making it possible to cure terrible diseases such as malaria
 small-pox plague pneumonia and tuberculosis science has
lenghtened the life of the average man 
In nineteen hundred every baby born in the U S A could be
expected to live less than fifty years 
Fifty years later the health conditions have so much improved
that the average length of life was nearly seventy years 
A few hundred years ago the average length of life was less
than thirty years 
 But it certain but it is certain sorry 
 but is it certain that people were less happy in those times
 ?
What is the use what what is the use of living longer
unless you are also happy ?
Science is helping man to produce much more food from the earth
By this it is helping to prevent famine and sickness due to
undernourishment 
It has also made it possible to send quick relief to places
where there is shortage of food and medicines with the help of motor uh
motor lorries railway trains ships and aeroplanes 
This is also very good and many lives are saved in such ways 
But in India and some other countries such as Indonesia and
South America the number of people is increasing faster than than the
food supply 
Science has not yet found out how to solve that problem 
It is a very serious because there will be worse and worse
famine unless it is solved 
And people certainly cannot be happy if they are starving 
can they ?
There are also many discoveries of science which have definitely
brought unhappiness into the world 
That is not because the discoveries are bad but because men
are using them badly 
For example consider the discovery of the gun powder and of
other explosives each more powerful than the previous one discovered 
In ancient times men could wound and kill each other only if they
were near enough to strike each other with stones arrows spears or
swords 
Even in the battles of the olden times which history calls
great battles the armies on both the sides usually consisted only of
a few thousand men and the number of wounded and killed in the wars 
of those times was not very great 
In most wars except a few such as the wars which destroyed the
Roman Empire the peasant went on cultivating their fields peacefully 
even when the armies were fighting a few miles away 
But the invention of fire arms and high explosives caused a
great change 
A modern machine gun or quick firing gun worked by a
single man can wound and kill hundreds of people in a few minutes
One modern bomb can kill thousands 
It is said that the latest type of atomic bomb could kill 
hundreds of thousands of people immediately if it was dropped on a big
city 
The scientists who invented these terrible weapons are
not wicked men who enjoy killing 
They are people with kind hearts like yours and mine but
they are more clever and they can earn their living by discovering new
things 
It is the leaders of the various nations who employ them to
make discoveries which can be used to kill the people of 
o other nations that are to blame 
The same country discoveries could be used only for useful
purposes if the leaders did not allow them to be used for killing 
Explosives are not harmful if they are used for such purposes
as helping to get coal metals and other minerals out of the earth 
The same motors and aeroplanes which are used to carry guns and
drop bombs can be very useful for good purposes 
So you see that it is not the discoveries and inventions that are
bad but the ways in which men use them 
Now let us try to find out why men use them for harmful
purposes 
It is not easy to find this out but it is very important 
Unless you can find it out there will be more and more terrible
wars in your your own time and if we go on like that our
grand-children will not be able to live in this world at all 
The earth will become a desert and mankind will come to an end 
With these few words I end my speech 
Thank you for giving me an oppotunity to speak 
Thank you once again 
Hello I'm Shantala speaking in uh speaking
 for the total literacy in if inevitable
 for the political social and economic development of a country
On the world scene on one hand India can stand proudly shoulder to
shoulder with frontline countries in matters of space research 
advanced technology etcetera 
But in literacy queue we are far behind other countries 
 It's well known world over that the areas of poverty and
illiteracy more or less overlap each other in a map and continued
illiteracy can be a major handicap for the growth and development of
democratic institution in a country 
In this context functional literacy becomes all the more
significant and important 
Mere advertisement and learning three hours is of no
consequence 
Rather than an end in itself literacy should be regarded as a
way of preparing man for social and civil and economic role 
Literacy teaching is resolutely oriented towards development 
and should be an integral part of not only of any national educational plans
 but also of plans and projects for development of all sectors of
national life 
Considering the experience of many other countries the targets
fixed by India's educational planners are by no means beyond
realisation but still are lagging behind 
 Let's analyse the need for our relevance of literacy in a
few more specific situations 
There are very prejudices facts and taboos which frown
upon literacy go indeed to demonstrate its strength
Let us start with the example of industrial workers 
An Industrial worker in a an organised
sector however intelligent and enterprising is also in need of access
to information about the source of raw material and its conversation to
 finished goods price standardisation and quality control marketing 
rate fixation process provision relating to safety and the work at
the work place etcetera 
A belief that thus an illiterate worker can also successfully
operate machines can repar repair and
maintain them is nothing but a an affirmation 
of a blind prejudice could be the outcome of vested interests 
A worker in the unorganised or the semi- organised sector
is in need of sem similar access to
information about various process of modernisation improved farming
 suitability of a particular soil to a particular crop quality of
seeds fertilisers and other modern methods 
The malfunctional middlemen who rob the legitimate share of the
farm and the forest produce may be tactfully dropped 
The plight of the share croppers of the landless agricultural
labourers fact factors which lead to
their indebtness and bondage will be improved to a very great extent 
Yet another important segment of the society is the rural artisans
They should also wake up from their traditional slumber and look
around them and the world 
They must look beyond the crude and antiquited ways of making goods
Example of back blacksmith 
should leave his old slumber and switch on to new electric arc
furnace etcetera
The potter to electric wheels and others 
In the social background improving the sta 
 status of women uh depends mostly on literating the
woman 
It helps in warding off the superstition and other social evils too
Woman it helps a woman in tracing her identity and strength
and weakness herself 
No more she is what we say in Sanskrit Koop Manduke
 that's the frog in the well 
And even in the political situation the voting right of a person
is denied that is because a person is illiterate 
And if a person is literate he ca he
cannot be deceived by the politi 
political parties or the politicians 
They can fight for the rights to a greater extent 
Thus literacy in a sense is not a dose which can produce instant
and dramatic results 
It can it's an absract weapon through though
powerful which gradually trains and equips some human mind and prepares
it increasingly for eventual change 
These few words of mine add up to the inevitability of total
literacy for a countries all round development 
Thank you
