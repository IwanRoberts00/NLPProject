<I>
I am told I have coronary artery disease what does it 
it actual actually mean ?
You see normally your heart requires inadequate
supply of blood 
Right
To enable it to perform its function of pumping blood to
the body 
Now this blood it receives through three major arteries 
which as you see on this model
Yeah
Goes on the surface of the heart 
Right 
When these arteries get blocked the process is known
as atherosclerosis 
Uhm uhm
Then the blood supply to the heart suffers 
And when this occurs during periods of stress the
diminished blood supply to the heart manifests as pain 
Uhm
Which is called angina 
So if one of these vessels were to get suddenly completely
blocked 
I see 
Then a portion of the heart muscle would die 
Oh 
And this is called miocardial infarction or in 
layman's term a heart attack 
And therefore why does this disease occur ?
Nobody really knows the exact cause for this disease 
I see 
But medical science has been able to identify certain
risk factors which predispose a patient for this disease
Uhm 
Of these risk factors one of the important ones is
smoking 
Oh 
The other risk factors are diabetes hypertension
 a high cholestrol diet belonging to the male sex and a
strong family history 
For example if your father or brother were to have pulmonary
artery disease ahn hn hn then the risk of having this
disease is increased 
 Ahn hn hn 
How do you confirm that uh an individual has got the
disease ?
You see initial investigations like a chest X-ray and
an E C G ahn ahn which should be performed by a private
practitioner would give a clue to the existence of this disease 
 ahn 
But the actual confirmation that one has this disease can
be made only by taking recourse to certain sophisticated investigations
 Ahn ahn 
 Ahn 
Right 
And the first of this is called an exercise
electrocardiogram 
Uhm uhm 
In this a continuous record of the patient's 
electrocardiogram is taken while he is subjected to graded exercise 
Right 
And this gives us an idea of the capacity of the heart
 to cope up with the exercise 
Right 
And if the heart is unable to do so uhm uhm 
then this manifests as chest pain or as changes in the
electrocardiogram which is recorded uhm uhm or as a
rise in the blood pressure 
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
Nuclear anginography is another recent innovation in
modern medicine I see which helps us to further define
the function of the heart 
And in this a radioactive drug is injected into the blood
stream 
 I see 
Right 
This accumulates in the heart and is picked up by
sensitive sensors 
Uhm uhm 
This gives us an idea of the exact amount of blood being
 pumped by the heart during each beat 
Uhm uhm 
It also tells us that the certain portions of the heart
 are not contracting properly uhm uhm or there are
certain areas of the heart which are receiving less blood supply 
 Uhm uhm 
Right 
The final diagnosis of course can be made after
a test called coronary archiography angiography 
Uhm uhm 
And this is the test which is performed under local
anaesthesia by the cardiologist and radiologist 
Uhm uhm 
And in this test a cathater is passed through the
femoral artery which is the blood vessel supplying the leg 
Right 
This cathater is pushed into the heart uhm 
and the radio opaque dye is injected into the heart and the coronary
arteries 
 Uhm 
Right 
This tells us firstly the function of the heart 
uhm uhm as well as delineates the anatomy of the coronary arteries
 uhm and shows us exactly where the disease process is
blocking the arteries 
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
This not only confirms the diagnosis for us uhm
uhm but it also tells us whether surgery is feasible and
if so uhm which portion of the artery should be repaired
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm 
I see 
So what is this bypass surgery ?
You see in bypass surgery our aim is to increase
the blood supply to the heart by surgical methods 
I see 
There are two ways to tackle this disease 
One is by giving medicines 
Uhm uhm 
However medicines can only improve the blood supply 
to the heart marginally 
Uhm uhm 
They mainly act by reducing the demands of the heart
 uhm and thereby the work capacity of the patient is
now significantly increased 
 Uhm 
Oh 
In bypass surgery we aim to actually increase the blood
 supply to the heart by creating bypass channels surgically 
Right 
Thereby not only the capacity of the heart is increased 
 uhm uhm but the capacity of the patient to lead a normal
active life right is increased 
 Uhm uhm 
 Right 
I see 
But what do you exactly do during this bypass surgery ?
I mean 
The exact surgical procedure is difficult to explain 
Uhm uhm 
But I have a video recording of a bypass surgery 
uhm uhm in progress 
 Uhm uhm 
Oh 
If you would like to see it ?
I will show it to you 
Ah ha certainly love to 
You are looking into an operation theatre 
The preparations for a coronary artery bypass procedure up in the
way 
The patient suffers background noise from coronary artery
disease and requires bypass graft of the blocked artery all the
perfusionists the nurses and the anaesthetists get ready
The patient is put under anaesthesia 
The chest and the leg are draped in sterile towels 
To expose the heart the skin overlying the breast bone
 is cut 
The underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue are then
divided to expose the breast bone 
Which is then cut through with an electric saw 
The procedure called sternotomy noise of sawing 
The heart is covered by a membranous sheet called the
pericordium and when this is cut the first view of the heart
beating underneath is accorded 
Meanwhile another set of surgeons has exposed the
long vein of the leg known as the saphenous vein 
Portions of this vein will be used as conduits by bypass
graphs cough 
When this has been done the stage is set to connect the
heart to the heart lung machine 
This machine will perform the function of the heart and lung
 during the entire procedure 
So this blood must be drained from the heart to the heart
lung machine and this is done by means of special plastic cannulae
This tube attached from the right side of the heart will
drain impure blood from the heart to the heart lung machine 
The blood will be purified in the heart lung machine and
will then be returned to the heart by means of another tube attached
to the aorta background noise 
This then completes the circuit which diverts the blood 
from the heart to the heart lung machine and then returns it to the
patient 
Thereby bypassing the heart and lungs 
During this time the heart can be made to stop and the
main operation performed 
The connections between the tubings and the heart must
not only be watertight but must also be secure to prevent any
accidental blow out during the operation 
Also care must be taken to prevent any air bubbles
from entering the circulation 
And the heart lung machine is started 
Blood will be pumped into the body and the patient's 
own heart will slow down and will stop injecting 
The saphenous vein is then distended and checked for any leaks 
and prepared for the anastomosis 
For this the heart must be completly stopped and so 
the blood supply to the heart is cut out by planting the aorta 
The cordioplagic solution is injected into the heart an
ice cold saline is poured on its surface to lower its temperature
This protects the heart during the period that is blood
supply is entirely cut off 
The selected artery is then cut beyond the block and
this probe shows that one end of the artery is completely obstructed
The grafting procedure starts by attaching one end of this
saphenous vein to this cut in the artery 
This anastomosis is performed with a very fine 
polypropelene suture 
A high degree of precision is required at this stage 
For this anastomosis must not only be watertight but
must be absolutely smooth so that the blood flow from the vein to
the artery is absolutely unhindered cough 
While all this is being done the heart lies completly
still protected by its lowered temperature as well as the
effects of the cardioplagic solution that has been injected into it
 surgeons at work: visuals 
Once this end of the anastomosis is completed the completion
of the graft requires that the other end of the graft be connected to
the aorta 
But this does not require a stand still heart and so 
the heart at this stage can be made to beat again after its blood
supply has been restored 
The other end of the saphenous vein is now prepared 
This end has to be connected to the aorta 
And for this a portion of this bl 
blood vessel is isolated in a special form 
An opening is made in this isolated portion of the aorta 
And to this opening the other end of the saphenous vein is
carefully sewn sewing the vein 
This again is performed with a very fine polypropelene suture
The completed graft now fills with blood and supplies
blood to the portion of the heart which was earlier deprived of blood
supply 
The oxygenator is the centre piece of the heart lung machine
 and performs the vital function of purifying the impure blood
that it receives from the body 
It oxygenates the blood and removes carbon dioxide 
Advances in modern medicine have made coronary artery
bypass surgery not only a safe procedure but also accessible to
the common man 
The same sequence of events continues and the second and
the third graft are placed in succession 
Thereby bypassing all three blocked vessels 
The completion of the procedure the heart beats vigorously
 and is now ready to be disconnected from the heart lung machine 
The connecting tubes are then removed one by one 
disconnecting tubes in machine 
All the openings in the heart are carefully stitched and
a final check is made to look for any bleeding points at the side
 of the anastomosis 
The major operation over the chest can now be closed 
The divided breast bone is approximated with stout
sutures and the subcutaneous tissue and the overlying skin are
stitched together in layers 
The graft at the end of the operation the patient will be
revived from anaesthesia and shifted to the intensive care unit
 for recovery
