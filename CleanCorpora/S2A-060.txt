<I>
""

I am told I have coronary artery disease 
it  ?
""
""
You see  inadequate
supply of blood 
""
""
Right
""
""
To enable it to perform its function  of pumping blood to
the body 
""
Now this blood 
which as you see on this model
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Goes on the surface of the heart 
""
""
Right 
""
""
When these arteries  the process is known
as atherosclerosis 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Then the blood supply to the heart suffers 
""
And when this occurs  the
diminished blood supply to the heart 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Which is called angina 
""
So if one of these vessels were to get suddenly  completely
blocked 
""
""
I see 
""
""
Then a portion of the heart muscle would die 
""
""
Oh 
""
""
And this is called miocardial infarction 
layman's 
""
""
And therefore why does this disease occur  ?
""
""
Nobody really knows 
""
""
I see 
""
""
But medical science has been able to identify  certain
risk factors  for this disease
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Of these risk factors  ones is
smoking 
""
""
Oh 
""
""
The other risk factors are  hypertension
 a
strong family history 
""
For example if your father or brother were to have  pulmonary
artery disease  having this
disease is increased 
""
""
""
""
""
How do you confirm that uh  an individual has got the
disease  ?
""
""
You see initial investigations  and
an E C G  which should be performed by a private
practitioner 
""
""
But the actual confirmation  can
be made only by  taking recourse to certain sophisticated investigations
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
And the first of this  is called an exercise
electrocardiogram 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
In this 
electrocardiogram is taken 
""
""
Right 
""
""
And this gives us an idea of  the capacity of the heart
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
And if the heart is unable to do so 
then this manifests as chest pain  in the
electrocardiogram  or as a
rise in the blood pressure 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Nuclear anginography  in
modern medicine  define
the function of the heart 
""
And in this  a radioactive drug is injected into the blood
stream 
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
This accumulates in the heart  and is picked up by
sensitive sensors 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
This gives us an idea  of the exact amount of blood being
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
It also tells us  that the certain portions of the heart
 or there are
certain areas of the heart which are receiving less blood supply 
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
The final diagnosis  after
a test called coronary 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And this is the test  which is performed under local
anaesthesia 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And in this test  through the
femoral artery 
""
""
Right 
""
""
This cathater is pushed 
and the radio opaque dye is injected  and the coronary
arteries 
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
This tells us firstly the function of the heart 
uhm uhm  the anatomy of the coronary arteries
 where the disease process is
blocking the arteries 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
This not only confirms the diagnosis for us  uhm
uhm  and
if so  which portion of the artery should be repaired
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
So what is this bypass surgery  ?
""
""
You see  to increase
the blood supply to the heart 
""
""
I see 
""
""
There are two ways to tackle this disease 
""
One is by giving medicines 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
However 
to the heart 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
They mainly act  the demands of the heart
 is
now significantly increased 
""
""
""
""
""
Oh 
""
""
In bypass surgery  we aim to actually increase the blood
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
Thereby not only the capacity of the heart is increased 
 to lead a normal
active life 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
But what do you exactly do during this bypass surgery  ?
""
I mean 
""
""
The exact surgical procedure 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
But I have a video recording of a bypass surgery 
uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
Oh 
""
""
If you would like to see it  ?
""
I will show it to you 
""
""
Ah ha certainly love to 
""
""
You are looking into an operation theatre 
""
The preparations for a coronary artery bypass procedure up in the
way 
""
The patient suffers  from coronary artery
disease  all the
perfusionists  get ready
""
The patient is put under anaesthesia 
""
The chest and the leg are draped in sterile towels 
""
To expose the heart  overlying the breast bone
""
""
The underlying fat  are then
divided 
""
Which is then cut through 
""
The procedure called sternotomy 
""
The heart is covered  by a membranous sheet called the
pericordium  the first view of the heart
beating underneath 
""
Meanwhile  the
long vein of the leg known as the saphenous vein 
""
Portions of this vein  by bypass
graphs 
""
When this has been done  to connect the
heart 
""
This machine  will perform the function of the heart and lung
""
""
So this  to the heart
lung machine  of special plastic cannulae
""
""
This tube attached from the right side of the heart  will
drain 
""
The blood will be purified  and
will then be returned to the heart  attached
to the aorta 
""
This then completes the circuit 
from the heart  and then returns it to the
patient 
""
Thereby bypassing the heart 
""
During this time  and the
main operation performed 
""
The connections  must
not only be watertight  to prevent any
accidental blow out 
""
Also  air bubbles
from entering the circulation 
""
And the heart lung machine 
""
Blood will be pumped into the body 
own heart 
""
The saphenous vein is then distended and checked for any leaks 
and prepared for the anastomosis 
""
For this 
the blood supply to the heart is cut out 
""
The cordioplagic solution  an
ice cold saline  to lower its temperature
""
""
This protects the heart  that is blood
supply 
""
The selected artery is then cut  and
this probe shows  is completely obstructed
""
""
The grafting procedure starts by attaching  one end of this
saphenous vein 
""
This anastomosis 
polypropelene suture 
""
A high degree of precision is required at this stage 
""
For this anastomosis  but
must be absolutely smooth  to
the artery 
""
While all this is being done  completly
still  as well as the
effects  that has been injected into it
""
""
Once this end of the anastomosis is completed  the completion
of the graft  that the other end of the graft be connected to
the aorta 
""
But this does not require 
the heart at this stage  after its blood
supply has been restored 
""
The other end of the saphenous vein 
""
This end has to be connected 
""
And for this 
blood 
""
An opening is made 
""
And to this opening  the other end of the saphenous vein is
carefully sewn 
""
This again is performed  with a very fine polypropelene suture
""
""
The completed graft  and supplies
blood  to the portion of the heart which was earlier deprived of blood
supply 
""
The oxygenator  is the centre piece of the heart lung machine
 the impure blood
that it receives from the body 
""
It oxygenates the blood 
""
Advances in modern medicine  coronary artery
bypass surgery  accessible to
the common man 
""
The same sequence of events continues  and
the third graft 
""
Thereby bypassing 
""
The completion of the procedure  the heart beats vigorously
""
""
The connecting tubes 
disconnecting tubes in machine 
""
All the openings in the heart  and
a final check is made  at the side
""
""
The major operation over 
""
The divided  with stout
sutures  are
stitched together in layers 
""
The graft at the end of the operation  will be
revived from anaesthesia  to the intensive care unit
""
