I am told I have coronary artery disease 
""
""
""
""
supply of blood 
""
""
Right
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Then the blood supply to the heart suffers 
""
""
diminished blood supply to the heart 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And this is called miocardial infarction 
layman's 
""
""
And therefore why does this disease occur  ?
""
""
Nobody really knows 
""
""
I see 
""
""
But medical science has been able to identify  certain
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 a
strong family history 
""
For example if your father or brother were to have  pulmonary
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
be made only by  taking recourse to certain sophisticated investigations
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
""
then this manifests as chest pain  in the
electrocardiogram  or as a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
stream 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
certain areas of the heart which are receiving less blood supply 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
anaesthesia 
""
""
""
""
""
And in this test  through the
femoral artery 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
This tells us firstly the function of the heart 
""
""
blocking the arteries 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You see  to increase
the blood supply to the heart 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to the heart 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
They mainly act  the demands of the heart
""
now significantly increased 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
""
 to lead a normal
active life 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
But what do you exactly do during this bypass surgery  ?
""
I mean 
""
""
The exact surgical procedure 
""
""
""
""
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
Oh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You are looking into an operation theatre 
""
""
way 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The underlying fat  are then
""
""
Which is then cut through 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
long vein of the leg known as the saphenous vein 
""
Portions of this vein  by bypass
""
""
""
heart 
""
This machine  will perform the function of the heart and lung
""
""
So this  to the heart
""
""
""
This tube attached from the right side of the heart  will
""
""
""
will then be returned to the heart  attached
""
""
This then completes the circuit 
from the heart  and then returns it to the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Also  air bubbles
""
""
""
""
""
own heart 
""
The saphenous vein is then distended and checked for any leaks 
""
""
For this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
This protects the heart  that is blood
""
""
The selected artery is then cut  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
polypropelene suture 
""
""
""
""
""
the artery 
""
""
""
effects  that has been injected into it
""
""
Once this end of the anastomosis is completed  the completion
""
""
""
""
the heart at this stage  after its blood
supply has been restored 
""
""
""
""
""
And for this 
""
""
""
""
And to this opening  the other end of the saphenous vein is
carefully sewn 
""
This again is performed  with a very fine polypropelene suture
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that it receives from the body 
""
""
""
Advances in modern medicine  coronary artery
""
""
""
The same sequence of events continues  and
""
""
Thereby bypassing 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a final check is made  at the side
""
""
""
""
""
""
stitched together in layers 
""
""
