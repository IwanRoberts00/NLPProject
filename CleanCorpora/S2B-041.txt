Professor Jahagirdar  has been

 day's
""
""
""
""
The other  to be standing
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
wish to speak  in many other places in the
""
""
As you have come here  I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it  In itself may not be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
level study  of English teaching
""
""
""
Now what are these two threats 
""
""
""
""
School and college teachers  and even some
university teachers 
""
""
""
""
""
I shall mention only one  that
they do not 
""
Anyhow the result is  and
rationalize  by arguing that we really do not know
""
""
""
Raj  or
mother tongue 
""
""
""
""
""
More of that 
""
""
exponents  urban
""
""
And also  in
very sophisticated 
""
These people argue 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That we should not study English literature  and
""
""
They attempt to convert English Departments 
study's 
""
""
""
Can we do both English studies  we
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I propose to examine the basic problems  in being
""
""
""
""
""
English in India it appears 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
war with English 
""
An International Congress of Marathi  made a great
""
""
""
""
there is no real crisis  for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
political merit 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Mixed up in this crisis scenerio  or
""
""
Some in English teaching establishments are saying  Why
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
English department 
""
""
mean other language literatures Marathi Hindi Telugu  imply
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
or literature  or a super-
""
""
""
""
""
""
To take just one parallel instance 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
schizophrenia 
""
""
""
""
For anything between 
""
""
we settle the question once  have not
""
""
What is this crisis politically  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Hindi  takes over as a link
language of our national  ?
""
What shall we do  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 or rather
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And what is complicating if not worst they seem to come  in
English via Europe and America 
""
""
""
""
""
""
If not English  ?
""
""
""
""
""
What is the crisis  ?
""
In simple terms  and again and
again 
""
""
""
If our aim is taken for granted  then this amongsts to
among other things  and
""
have set for ourselves in this regard 
""
Should we not ask such a fundamental question  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
question already  I would like to emphasis that we ought not to allow
""
""
""
""
well claim the right to reopen 
""
Take away  create the condition that our
previous decision need not be considered  fate accompli
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What must we do if we do decide  not to teach or learn English
""
""
""
""
""
""
Alternative one  Shall we teach the rest of the world
an Indian language 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Alternative two  Shall we try to live our national
""
""
""
""
 Russian French or Japanese
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the world 
""
""
international language which we can then continue 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
obviously to all sorts of threats of new colonization from many many sources
""
""
""
""
integrity and even our sovereignity ?
""
""
query 
""
""
""
feeling even today 
""
Suppose we take the third alternative  to switch to another
""
""
""
""
""
By the way  that is not
""
""
""
to languages like Sanskrit 
""
""
""
Dismantling all our international and also related  national
business and activity 
""
Dismantling our machinery for proliferation of English 
""
 that new international
