Professor Jahagirdar  has been
extremely kind  deserving
""
""
My friend Ashok 
""
Uh before you  work in the morning
 put the
 day's
""
""
Which he has done for me 
""
The other  to be standing
here and giving a public lecture  clearing
his throat 
""
As you can see 
uhm  uh is meant for people
who are 
""
I am somewhat 
do  because the subject on which I
wish to speak  in many other places in the
country 
""
As you have come here  I
will not take more time  tell you how I do not deserve to
be here but get on with it now that I am 
""
Dear 
""
By way of introduction to my talk today 
ground 
""
One which is pervasive  India
""
""
The other which is threatening to change  of
English teaching  with
it  In itself may not be
a bad thing at all
""
I don't mind if English is destroyed  the worst thing that will
happen is 
""
I think I can find another one 
""
The first uh let me say that my talk does not concerned university
level study  of English teaching
 and College level
""
""
Now what are these two threats 
""
The first one comes  teaching of the English
""
""
School and college teachers  and even some
university teachers 
""
What is that they do can be given 
""
But instead 
""
I shall mention only one  that
they do not 
""
Anyhow the result is  and
rationalize  by arguing that we really do not know
English 
""
English  British
Raj  or
mother tongue 
""
Now these are destruction tactics  because those who wish to
honour their  under any
circumstances 
""
More of that 
""
The second threat  powerful because its
exponents  urban
education 
""
And also  in
very sophisticated 
""
These people argue 
Chiplunkar  that to study English is to
continue 
""
That if we study English  we
become post-colonially colonized 
""
And besides  of the means to
engage in culture studies 
that the greatest  is its literature
""
""
Therefore they argue that we should not study English literature
""
""
That we should not study English literature  and
world 
""
They attempt to convert English Departments 
study's 
""
Is there anything  ?
""
Can we do both English studies  we
wish to  ?
""
History tells us most emphatically 
""
There are persons in my own audience here today  who have done
this 
""
Therefore  on
English  who has both studied and taught
English well 
""
I propose to examine the basic problems  in being
uncertain 
""
That is why my title  or not to
English 
""
English in India it appears 
""
It appears to be insecure 
political arena 
some academia is also  as though
""
""
At least one State in India  seems openly at
war with English 
""
An International Congress of Marathi  made a great
deal of noise about the continuing  of English in Maharashtra
""
""
Without any hesitation however  it needs to be said that either
there is no real crisis  for
ideological 
""
Or that it is essentially the same old  pre-Independence crisis
""
""
More than four whole decades  have past since the crucial
achievement  of an essentially older
generation 
""
To be found still harping on the same crisis  in the belief that
it still  that from keeping it
alive will approve  and
political merit 
""
""
And at least for that reason  and unjustifiable
for a nation  that hopes to march through centuries of backlog of
development  in the space of a very few Five Years Plans
""
""
Mixed up in this crisis scenerio  or
what is at least made to look like it 
""
Some in English teaching establishments are saying  Why
should they be teaching English  for
instance  departments of
English 
""
There are also those who would like to keep reminding us  that
English in India today 
""
Regarding the first sort of question  first
""
taught or study  they can be taught without teaching them in the
English department 
""
To wish to teach other literatures in English department  and I
mean other language literatures Marathi Hindi Telugu  imply
some great confusion 
""
Second  that India does
not need 
""
Third 
""
Third there is nothing more colonial 
British American  in a department of
English  in a department of Hindi
""
""
As for the more fundamental  Why English at all
 ?
""
If anyone feels deeply that their career in English  language
or literature  or a super-
colonial betrayal 
take up some less renegade 
""
This is not to dismiss  but to place
them on par with other such 
""
To take just one parallel instance 
""
Those who feel that western medicine is a betrayal of 
Ayurveda  should give up
western medicine 
Ayurveda 
""
I would like to leave such cases behind right at the outset by
saying 
schizophrenia 
""
Further is  or not to English
""
""
For anything between 
""
Let us take another look at this crisis  or dilemma even though
we settle the question once  have not
changed 
""
What is this crisis politically  ?
""
How long shall we  let this English language
continue as the major link language of the country  ?
""
When will Hindi  ?
""
No one seems to be in right mood to ask 
Hindi  takes over as a link
language of our national  ?
""
What shall we do  ?
""
Which  does endanger those subtle
and growth way 
""
What is the crisis ideologically 
""
Apparently  to being or to
 or rather
earlier 
""
But that reaction is a feeling known 
""
And indeed to such a question that should be our answer 
""
But ideological arguments in this connection  come in English
""
""
And what is complicating if not worst they seem to come  in
English via Europe and America 
""
At least for me  in
any case this agrument also seems  just like the political argument to
fail to address the very practical problem before us  or before the nation
""
""
If not English  ?
""
For the English teaching establishments the apparently active
English departments in the university  but by implication of the passive
departments in colleges and schools
""
What is the crisis  ?
""
In simple terms  and again and
again 
""
""
""
If our aim is taken for granted  then this amongsts to
among other things  and
eventually a most horandous shortfall  in our achievement of the goals we
have set for ourselves in this regard 
""
Should we not ask such a fundamental question  ?
""
Obviously we may 
""
But whether we ignore its practical implications  is the issue
for me 
""
And assuming that our nation has  affirmatively answer the
question already  I would like to emphasis that we ought not to allow
confusion or distraction to affect adversly  our performance of the task
""
""
Now as a democracy  we might
well claim the right to reopen 
""
Take away  create the condition that our
previous decision need not be considered  fate accompli
""
""
But as long as we do not do so  with full awareness of
consequences  or
enhance 
""
Not as a negative 
""
What must we do if we do decide  not to teach or learn English
any more  ?
""
Well we must then decide 
""
I see only three alternatives 
""
Alternative one  Shall we teach the rest of the world
an Indian language 
""
Even say if you like 
""
So that we may converse with them or in all ways  that
international and therefore national life demands 
""
Alternative two  Shall we try to live our national
international life without English  for it
""
""
And three  Or shall we choose an alternative language
 Russian French or Japanese
 in which to conduct our
international business 
""
If we choose the first alternative 
""
Let us girdle our loins for the task of the next couple of hundred
years or so  that
outsiders wish to learn Hindi 
""
Then  all over
the world 
""
Find in other words the ways and means  to install Hindi as our
international language which we can then continue 
""
Lessons of the last four decades or so right here in India 
ought to teach us what the real response to this questions should be 
""
If we choose the second alternative  not to bother with any
international language  and
nation  given the cultural linguistic diversity in India
""
""
We have a very rich culture  so
obviously to all sorts of threats of new colonization from many many sources
""
""
That is to say even if we could imagine situation of international
linguistic vacuum for India  our
integrity and even our sovereignity ?
""
In a fiercly international world  is not in a moot
query 
""
The answer is too depressing to contemplate  especially I hope
it is depressing to those  who feel the wealth of previous colonization
feeling even today 
""
Suppose we take the third alternative  to switch to another
language than English 
""
A language not tainted by colonial  for us
""
""
By the way  that is not
tainted by  ?
""
This question is just as revealing in the past tense  and apply
to languages like Sanskrit 
""
What will that decision entail  ?
""
Dismantling all our international and also related  national
business and activity 
""
Dismantling our machinery for proliferation of English 
preparing for and installing in its place  the entire machinery required
 that new international
language
