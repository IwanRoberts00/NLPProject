<I>
Professor Jahagirdar sound of bell has been
extremely kind to me I can thank him without deserving
 for my work 
My friend Ashok has given me the right treatment 
Uh before you start your day's work in the morning
 you have to catch your oxen and then you must put the
 ropes through their nose and then get on with the day's
 jobs 
Which he has done for me cough 
The other reason why I feel I do not deserve to be standing
here and giving a public lecture is quite obvious clearing
his throat 
As you can see the lecture is not meant for people like me 
uhm I can't keep my papers on and then read uh is meant for people
who are normal clearing his throat 
I am somewhat different from normal but I'll 
do what I think needs to be done because the subject on which I
wish to speak has become if not here in many other places in the
country and awfully important question 
As you have come here uh uh forsaking your lunch hour I
will not take more time to uh tell you how I do not deserve to
be here but get on with it now that I am here 
Dear panel students 
By way of introduction to my talk today I must explain two 
ground facts 
One which is pervasive throughout non-metropolitant India
The other which is threatening to change the foundation of
English teaching or rather to do kar seva with
it that is to say to destroy it completely In itself may not be
a bad thing at all
I don't mind if English is destroyed the worst thing that will
happen is I'll lose my job 
I think I can find another one somewhere 
The first uh let me say that my talk does not concerned university
level study alone but also the basic levels of English teaching
 and learning at the High School Junior College and College level
 as well 
Now what are these two threats that I spoke of 
The first one comes from the non- teaching of the English
School and college teachers generally and even some
university teachers actually do not teach English 
What is that they do can be given other names 
But instead the students don't learn English 
I shall mention only one perhaps the central reason that
they do not know English 
Anyhow the result is that they begin to justify and
rationalize their failure by arguing that we really do not know
English 
English that it is a hang over from the colonial British
Raj that we must really attend to our regional language or
mother tongue 
Now these are destruction tactics because those who wish to
honour their mother tongue have always learnt it under any
circumstances 
More of that a little later 
The second threat more recent powerful because its
exponents have generally have the advantage of English medium urban
education 
And also because their arguments come from abroad in
very sophisticated and precise words 
These people argue as though we have not have any Tilak 
Chiplunkar Phule or Karmveer that to study English is to
continue English or British colonization 
That if we study English because of any reason whatever we
become post-colonially colonized 
And besides they also speak in the same way of the means to
engage in culture studies but deny the simple and obvious fact 
that the greatest single repository of culture is its literature
Therefore they argue that we should not study English literature
 but only Indo- English literature 
That we should not study English literature but local and
world literature 
They attempt to convert English Departments into cultural 
study's department or departments of world literature 
Is there anything seriously wrong with these two threats ?
Can we do both English studies and Indian studies if we
wish to ?
History tells us most emphatically yes 
There are persons in my own audience here today who have done
this 
Therefore on the excuse of looking at one such teacher on
English Ayyappa Panikar from Kerala who has both studied and taught
English well and worked effectively in his own mother tongue 
I propose to examine the basic problems involved in being
uncertain regarding whether to study and teach English or not 
That is why my title To be uh to English or not to
English the lesson of Ayyappa Panikar 
English in India it appears is in a crisis 
It appears to be insecure to observers of the linguistic 
political arena as also to those in the academic arena which 
some academia is also another linguistic political arena as though
 we did not always know it 
At least one State in India Uttar Pradesh seems openly at
war with English 
An International Congress of Marathi recently made a great
deal of noise about the continuing hegemony of English in Maharashtra
Without any hesitation however it needs to be said that either
there is no real crisis but that one is being conjured up for
ideological game by ideologues 
Or that it is essentially the same old pre-Independence crisis
 which is hoped to have stoped with Independence 
More than four whole decades have past since the crucial
achievement I mean Independance of an essentially older
generation 
To be found still harping on the same crisis in the belief that
it still exists unchanged or in the hope that from keeping it
alive will approve linguistic political or academic and
political merit seems backward looking if not one word 
And at least for that reason unjustified and unjustifiable
for a nation that hopes to march through centuries of backlog of
development not my word in the space of a very few Five Years Plans
Mixed up in this crisis scenerio is a conscience crisis or
what is at least made to look like it 
Some in English teaching establishments are saying Why
should they be teaching English literature why not our own for
instance why should be the departments be called departments of
English and not departments of literature 
There are also those who would like to keep reminding us that
English in India today is a matter of post-colonial colonization 
Regarding the first sort of question we may answer first
 that if other literatures need to be stu 
taught or study they can be taught without teaching them in the
English department 
To wish to teach other literatures in English department and I
mean other language literatures Marathi Hindi Telugu Malyalam imply
some great confusion regarding the function of English in India 
Second there seems to be no reason to deny that India does
not need so many departments of English literature 
Third there is nothing sound of bell 
Third there is nothing more colonial in teaching English 
British American Commonwealth included in a department of
English than in teaching Hindi literature in a department of Hindi
 or Organic Chemistry in a department of Organic Chemistry 
As for the more fundamental question Why English at all
 ?
If anyone feels deeply that their career in English language
or literature teaching is either empty patriotic or a super-
colonial betrayal they can atleast by way of that career to 
take up some less renegade or more self-respectful career 
This is not to dismiss struggling consciences but to place
them on par with other such 
To take just one parallel instance 
Those who feel that western medicine is a betrayal of 
Ayurveda in the same way such Allopath should give up
western medicine and trained train in 
Ayurveda or another career 
I would like to leave such cases behind right at the outset by
saying that unskilled assessment will help avoid 
schizophrenia 
Further is To English or not to English
 that seems to be the question 
For anything between means waste through confusion 
Let us take another look at this crisis or dilemma even though
we settle the question once and the reasons for doing so have not
changed since then 
What is this crisis politically ?
How long shall we if we shall let this English language
continue as the major link language of the country ?
When will Hindi take over ?
No one seems to be in right mood to ask Why should 
Hindi take over or what if Hindi takes over as a link
language of our national life ?
What shall we do about our international life ?
Which whether we like it or not does endanger those subtle
and growth way on our national life 
What is the crisis ideologically are we ? 
Apparently it's a rhetorical question to being or to
 to be or to to continue to be colonized by the language or rather
earlier colonial rulers 
But that reaction is a feeling known 
And indeed to such a question that should be our answer 
But ideological arguments in this connection come in English
 mostly addressd to English users 
And what is complicating if not worst they seem to come in
English via Europe and America 
At least for me after such knowledge what forgiveness in
any case this agrument also seems just like the political argument to
fail to address the very practical problem before us or before the nation
If not English then what ?
For the English teaching establishments the apparently active
English departments in the university but by implication of the passive
departments in colleges and schools
What is the crisis ?
In simple terms people are asking again and again and
again Ought we to be teaching studying Engish 
 I've already tried to indicate my answer to that 
If our aim is taken for granted when then this amongsts to
among other things distraction confusion waste of time and effort and
eventually a most horandous shortfall in our achievement of the goals we
have set for ourselves in this regard 
Should we not ask such a fundamental question ?
Obviously we may and we shall 
But whether we ignore its practical implications is the issue
for me 
And assuming that our nation has affirmatively answer the
question already I would like to emphasis that we ought not to allow
confusion or distraction to affect adversly our performance of the task
Now as a democracy let us have admited right away we might
well claim the right to reopen the issue 
Take away the assumption create the condition that our
previous decision need not be considered our fate accompli
 
But as long as we do not do so with full awareness of
consequences we have better not do anything that will foster or
enhance the downward trend in achievement of the task 
Not as a negative implication 
What must we do if we do decide not to teach or learn English
any more ?
Well we must then decide what we shall do 
I see only three alternatives 
Alternative one Shall we teach the rest of the world
an Indian language 
Even say if you like Hindi 
So that we may converse with them or in all ways that
international and therefore national life demands 
Alternative two Shall we try to live our national
international life without English and without any replacement for it
 
And three Or shall we choose an alternative language
 another international language like German Russian French or Japanese
 or another of our very own choice in which to conduct our
international business 
If we choose the first alternative fine 
Let us girdle our loins for the task of the next couple of hundred
years or so in which we must become internationally so important that
outsiders wish to learn Hindi 
Then arrrange a one word like programme all over
the world or a Hindi Council to rival the British Council 
Find in other words the ways and means to install Hindi as our
international language which we can then continue to use 
Lessons of the last four decades or so right here in India 
ought to teach us what the real response to this questions should be 
If we choose the second alternative not to bother with any
international language we shall either create an Indian culture and
nation precisely given the cultural linguistic diversity in India
 it may not be quite so bad 
We have a very rich culture or we shall be subject to so
obviously to all sorts of threats of new colonization from many many sources
 have had 
That is to say even if we could imagine situation of international
linguistic vacuum for India how long we may be able to sustain our
integrity and even our sovereignity ?
In a fiercly international world this is not in a moot
query 
The answer is too depressing to contemplate especially I hope
it is depressing to those who feel the wealth of previous colonization
feeling even today 
Suppose we take the third alternative to switch to another
language than English 
A language not tainted by colonial oppressive past for us
By the way is there a major language anywhere that is not
tainted by a colonial oppressive past ?
This question is just as revealing in the past tense and apply
to languages like Sanskrit or Telugu or Marathi 
What will that decision entail ?
Dismantling all our international and also related national
business and activity that depends on English today 
Dismantling our machinery for proliferation of English 
preparing for and installing in its place the entire machinery required
 in the process of teaching and learning that new international
language
