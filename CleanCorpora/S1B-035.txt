Almost every country in the world today has to grapple with the
""
""
""
""
referred to as demographic transition 
""
""
will raise many vital and new questions which need to be addressed urgently
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
May we introduce them to you
""
""
the president of the International Federation 
""
""
former Vice  Pro-Vice-Chancellor Delhi University and a United Nation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
years ago 
""
 in membership of this
organization 
""
""
of this organization 
""
We are interested  at the policy level which
means  we have research programmes in medical as
""
""
""
""
where we provide the necessary technical know-how 
""
""
United Nations 
""
""
""
""
Dr Gokhale there is also an Indian Federation of Aging 
 what about this organization ?
""
""
""
""
""
Indian Federation of Aging was started about five years ago
""
""
They are interested in developing old age homes 
""
""
""
So now they are developing day care centres 
""
They also have their own publication called 
""
""
They also relate to a number of voluntary organizations in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Delhi 
""
""
Dr Gangarade  uh you are an expert on aging again Sudhir
before you take over 
""
""
As a expert
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
eighty-six percent of the  will be found only in the Asian
""
""
""
""
""
the people old in the 
""
""
""
""
""
In fact if you take third world as such 
""
""
""
""
""
Well you see  the kind of changes
which were odd in the  the old people
""
""
""
old people 
""
Both  as well as in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That he is not a productive market 
""
So whatever we hear  that whenever we talk of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fortieth 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 youngster living the sixty year fifty
""
""
""
""
""
""
is  as a
""
""
Thereby  thereby they retained
""
""
""
""
""
As far as I can see it there are two  primary causes for this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The most important point to remember  let us identify three
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If an old person is physically sound  if the old person is also
economically 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the relationships are certainly maintained 
""
""
""
""
""
That kind of emotional tie is is remaining there 
""
So but  the kind of inflation which is taking place all-round
""
problem etcetera 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because firstly the scarcity of the space in the  in the house
""
""
""
high 
""
""
""
""
both are working wife and husband 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 Kisi bhi samaj ki kisi bhi desh ki arthik vyavasta jo
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  will be the
""
""
""
""
""
""
Basically Deepakjee  you have a large
population of people of sixty plus age group or age bracket  the
""
""
Many thereby should take the 
""
""
There are more people at the younger age who depend on the people
who earn 
""
""
""
""
Which means  on the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
social security 
""
Social security  presently is only for the organized sector of
""
""
farmer 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
whereby pension could be replaced  by some funding while they are earning
""
""
""
provident fund etcetera 
""
""
encourage people  to take up a new assignment at the age of forty
""
""
""
""
""
""
They start giving the person one day off at the age of fifty-five
""
""
""
 to change job
""
""
""
""
""
In other words  at
""
be after discussion of some agency like the government  or of the
individual himself
""
""
It has got to be with the individual  and not with any
government 
""
Because whether you are able to work or not  is something you
""
""
""
""
""
Farmers doesn't retire  and politicians you know they just
""
""
""
he should retire 
""
""
 incident recently
""
""
""
""
And she said  I had a full time
""
""
""
which is 
""
""
""
""
""
jara hai ke mahilaye jo hain woh  purushon ki apeksha unka jo jeevan hai
wo jyada lamba hota hai 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Dekhye jo  hota hai woh bhi karib karib
""
""
Nahi usne kaam nahi kiya hai usne  ko
""
hota hai  society must also
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Without the work men feels some vaccum kind of it 
""
""
""
government service 
""
""
study-room 
""
""
laughs 
""
""
He gets into a particular kind of routine
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
time  uh really we should have talked about it a little earlier
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that are being discussed
""
""
""
You see out of the total disable population in the world  sixty
""
""
So we would like to discuss that 
""
""
for the elderly population 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
rights and the responsibilities of elderly 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And of course in addition to this there would be a number of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Number one 
""
You know presently people  that aging is a
problem 
""
We want to change it 
they must be ready 
""
""
So the change of emphasis 
""
""
""
""
""
""
from their family  but make them live in their families and be productive
""
""
""
Well I would just like to add here
""
""
Sir
""
""
Most important point the conference will arrive at it 
""
""
""
""
""
of the old  it will be very
difficult for any other agencies to take care of it 
""
""
beautifully said  the best thing yet to
""
""
""
Wonderfull 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
not be considered as burden or a problem
""
""
""
Well thank you very much gentlemen for being with us
""
