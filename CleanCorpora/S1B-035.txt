Almost every country in the world today has to grapple with the
challenge of population aging or the growth of the number of older
persons in any society or population 
Death appears to be more or less a universal phenomenon and it is
referred to as demographic transition 
In the century to come this isssue of population aging 
will raise many vital and new questions which need to be addressed urgently
In India for example at present the number of people in our
society in the sixty plus age group is some fifty-five million 
In about thirty years the number could well be 
two hundred million 
The first international conference on aging is to be held and in
fact being held in India
At this time we have with us in our studios today two eminent
experts in the field of aging 
May we introduce them to you
We have first on my far right Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale who is
the president of the International Federation on Aging 
And then we have immediately to my right Dr K B Gangarade
former Vice Pro-Vice-Chancellor Delhi University and a United Nation
expert on aging
I can't think of anything else to call your designation laughs
 a few words 
Quite right
I use that I for what uh uh many other 
Uh may we begin with you Dr Gokhale
There is an International Federation on aging which is the
moving spirit behind this conference recently being held in Bombay and Pune
Would you tell us about this International Federation ?
Yes this federation was established about twenty-five
years ago 
 We've about hundred countries in membership of this
organization 
We have about twenty international agencies which are in membership
of this organization 
We are interested in programmes at the policy level which
means we have conferences we have research programmes in medical as
well as non-medical subjects 
We have publications and the field programmes or the
grass-root programmes are really developed at the country level 
where we provide the necessary technical know-how and support 
And we also act as a body which is consulted by the
United Nations on the subject of population aging 
That is what is the broad description of this organization 
Dr Gokhale there is also an Indian Federation of Aging 
 yeah what about this organization ?
 Yeah 
Indian Federation of Aging was started about five years ago
They are interested in developing old age homes 
But old age home is a concept which is becoming out of date 
So now they are developing day care centres 
They also have their own publication called 
Kanchan-Kalp 
They also relate to a number of voluntary organizations in the
country which are working in the field of aging
They co-ordinate them 
They are also in the area of development of policy and
advocates 
That is briefly the role of the Indian Federation of Aging 
And in addition to Indian Federation there are other five-member
agencies such as Lok-Kalyan Samitee in
Delhi and other which work in this particular area 
Dr Gangarade uh you are an expert on aging again Sudhir
before you take over 
As a expert
But there is a global dimension to this demographic
transition through which so many societies are passing 
 Kyon ke jitni bhi samay jitne bhi samaj hai lagta hai
ke jo bujurg umr ke loog hai unki sankhya badhti jarahi hai 
What are the global dimensions of this issue ?
Let me tell you first by two thousand AD 
eighty-six percent of the old people will be found only in the Asian
region 
We can say dimension of the Asian region 
If you take the whole world as such about fifty-six percent of
the people old in the whole world 
From that particular point of view ninteen-eighty to two
thousand the period will be that the population of the old people
 will be much more than the young and the younger 
In fact if you take third world as such there is a 
somewhere there is a very good formula that's third age
 plus third world and third is it equivalent to third class 
 Laughs 
Well you see a and that means the kind of changes
which were odd in the one word they are most the old people
 after modernization has done not the time to do it 
In fact modernization has been a kind of a curse to the
old people 
Both in the western and industrial society as well as in
 our society also 
In the western society the young is accepted because he
is a productive element 
But the moment the one becomes old he 
dis out of the you can say productive market 
That he is not a productive market he is not respected 
So whatever we hear it is true that whenever we talk of the
old age let me slightly say here that the concept of aging must
change in the sense there are some people who may have what I
call the functional age 
That even after the age of hundred years they are active 
We can have a number of example that before eighty eighty-five 
the one or two word may be more a active than on the
fortieth 
There may be some people who are not so much active 
For it is it is not a chronological age that becomes important 
But what is the age become important personal age 
So to what extent you can one word functionally important
 depends that is it possible youngster living the sixty year fifty
year age the retirement age
Because what we call retired not the reason of old but he
is retired because of the chronological age 
So they all majo major problem
is to what extent we can continue to make the old people as a
productive agent of the society
Thereby they retained their status thereby they retained
their spirit thereby also they become proud of themselves 
Dr Gangarade may I interrupt at this stage 
As far as I can see it there are two primary causes for this
 global phenomenon of demographic transition about old people in
society
The first would be declining fertility rate and the second
possibly increase in life expectency 
That being so what are the repercussion on a country's
 socio-economic structure of this phenomenon of aging ?
 Let's ask Dr Gangarade
The most important point to remember let us identify three
factors which are which are very important
Okay 
One is let's say one word Indian society
itself
At one time there was no occupational difference between the
old and the young 
Whatever the father did the son did the same thing 
Now with the technological change there is a lot of
occupational differences taken taking place 
Similarly with the migration some time old people remains in
the village and the younger persons comes to the town 
So that is the another problem 
Third is also our individualistic way of life is also gradually
 taken place 
To that extent the first socio-economic problem is what I call
it if you take into four four kind of formula or criteria 
If an old person is physically sound if the old person is also
economically happy or healthier that is economically sound 
Socially and mentally if he is also alert then that old person
becomes a wanted person 
But if you minus each of these than becomes an unwanted person
But what happens even a let us say in our society where still
the relationships are certainly maintained 
Because even if you see sometime even though the uh younger
may not like the older people but the older people wants to remain with
their grand children 
That kind of emotional tie is is remaining there 
So but the kind of inflation which is taking place all-round
when I use the word all-round prices see in a city the housing
problem etcetera 
So sometimes the younger people begin to feel either the old
people should remain in the village or get out of the house as soon
as possible 
To give you a very concrete example in one of my surveys I
found that even the father in Delhi is welcome for three days 
If after fourth day remains the both the in-laws that
is daughter otherwise son-in-law begins to feel there is something wrong
somewhere and he must get out 
So even the father is not welcome to
Why ?
Because firstly the scarcity of the space in the in the house
Secondly also because now- a-days the rate prices are
high 
Economically it is not possible 
But what happens is why sometimes they are welcoming when they
both are working wife and husband 
Sometime they feel to have the old people is good so that
they can do baby-sitting job 
So the yane most perhaps they begin to
feel that old people are needed for a baby-sitting job 
Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale agala prashna apke liye hai
 Ji kahiye 
 Kisi bhi samaj ki kisi bhi desh ki arthik vyavasta jo
hai uspar kya prabhav padta hai is uh prashna ka 
I I means mean I'm little
reluctant to refer to it as a problem
 But aging is not really a problem it's an
issue 
So wha wha what will be the
impact on the economic health of the country ?
 Ahn 
Basically Deepakjee uh once you have a large
population of people of sixty plus age group or age bracket the
dependency ratio starts increasing 
Many thereby should take the continue 
continuation of life from zero to hundred 
There are more people at the younger age who depend on the people
who earn 
Similarly there is a larger group of people above the age of sixty
 who're depending on the earnings of the fewer people 
Which means that more people are dependent on the
earnings of fewer people 
Which is a basically economic problem 
And countries like Japan are really facing this problem very
 serious seriously 
The other issue is the issue of pension graduity or
social security 
Social security presently is only for the organized sector of
society uhm and not for the unorga 
unorganized sectors like the landless labours or the small
farmer 
So how to provide security to these groups is another issue 
And thirdly most of the countries in the West are finding
 that pension is no more an answer to meet the needs of the
people who are sixty plus 
And therefore they are finding or searching for new ways 
whereby pension could be replaced by some funding while they are earning
Also the other issue related to this uh uh by pension and
provident fund etcetera is providing the third career to the people 
Now the uh most of the countries in the West are trying to
encourage people to take up a new assignment at the age of forty
They can change jobs 
And lastly they are trying to prepare people for so called
retirement 
They start giving the person one day off at the age of fifty-five
 so that he can develop some alternatives 
At the age of fifty-six they will give him two days off like that
 at the age of sitxy years he is totally ready to change job
 Uhm 
In other words Dr Gokhale the time at which at
the age at which the person withdraws from the labour force should this
be after discussion of some agency like the government or of the
individual himself
It has got to be with the individual and not with any
government 
Because whether you are able to work or not is something you
can decide 
In India for example a businessman doesn't retired 
 retire untill he himself feel that he has to retire 
Farmers doesn't retire and politicians you know they just
don't retire 
So point is if a person feels that he should retire certainly
he should retire 
But if he feels that he can work I I remember Deepak mm mm
 incident recently
One of my collegues in the UN retired uh and I was asking his
wife how does she feels now when the husband is in the home ?
And she said that previousely I had a full time
salary and a part-time husband 
And now I have a part-time salary and full time husband 
which is a few words laughs 
Dr Gangarade uh may we come to you for a movement now 
 Kai aise sawal hai aaj hamare sansar mei jahan yeh dekha
jara hai ke mahilaye jo hain woh purushon ki apeksha unka jo jeevan hai
wo jyada lamba hota hai they can they live longer than man 
ab iska kya asar padhta hai samaj par 
 Ek jo abhi jo Gokhale saheb ne kaha jo aap
 economic sawal puchhe uspar mai kahna chahunga 
Dekhye jo young hota hai woh bhi karib karib
chaar decade tak jyada saal tak kam karta hai 
Nahi usne kaam nahi kiya hai usne society ko
 contribute kiya hai ab society ka ye jaroor
hota hai response the reciprocation society must also
reciprocate him 
 Dekhye jo is wakht hamara jo khas sawal is prakar ka hai
 ke jab life expectency bad rahi hai to world
 a few words 
It is not only the money which is important but what is
important is the work or occupation is a therapy 
Without the work men feels lonely 
Without the work men feels some vaccum kind of it 
As Dr Gokhale was saying I can give an example as I said
again to repeat in my own study I found a person who retired from the
government service 
By ten O'clock he would put his shoes go in his
study-room take all the files 
Whatever the files he had and look everyday upto five 
laughs 
He gets into a particular kind of routine
Whole organization get disturbed 
Yeah
So so one of his routinisation like you said the wife
will have no problem laughter a few words 
Dr Gokhale now this conference that is going on right at this
time uh really we should have talked about it a little earlier
But then in the morning show we are different from the rest so 
we have just a couple of minutes left 
Now what are issues that you are discussing in this conference ?
You see there are uh major issues pertaining to aging
that are being discussed
Such as disability and aging 
You see out of the total disable population in the world sixty
percent people are elder 
So we would like to discuss that 
We would like to discuss the issues regarding social security 
for the elderly population 
We would like to discuss indigenious health services such as
 Ayurveda Acupuncture Unani system
What can they do for aging ?
 That's another subject we are going to discuss 
But more than that we are going to discuss the subject of the
rights and the responsibilities of elderly 
A charter that was discussed at the economic and social
council of UN which is being discussed in this informal sector and
subsequently it will go to United Nations 
That is a very important subject that we have to discuss 
And of course in addition to this there would be a number of 
subjects number of lectures etcetra
And finally Dr Gokhale uh the conference will 
one or two words 
What do you expect to emerge at the end of the conference ?
We are really hoping 
Number one that the whole emphasis will change 
You know presently people tend to think that aging is a
problem or its a subject of charity 
We want to change it to make that aging an elderly 
they must be ready participated to participate 
they must be productive 
So the change of emphasis that's what we we want 
Secondly what we want is an acceptance of the charter of the
rights of the elderly 
And thirdly what we want is to prepare a kind of a blue print
of action at the national level where we need not uproot the people
from their family but make them live in their families and be productive
Well I would just like to add here
Sir
Most important point the conference will arrive at it 
The care of the elderly is in the home that is in his own family
 and in his own community 
And unless the community and the family participates in the care
of the old whether he is a disabled or not it will be very
difficult for any other agencies to take care of it 
I would also like to quote here that Robert Browning has very
beautifully said Grow old along with me the best thing yet to
be 
Wonderfull 
Dr Gokhale Dr Gangarade thank you very much for being with us
in our studios and as you have heard that this vital issue of aging is going
to be discussed at this conference
There will be greater international awareness after it 
And there is also hope for people like me in a couple of hundred
years when I'm retired it's possible that I'll 
not be considered as burden or a problem
But uh still a productive force
Well thank you very much gentlemen for being with us
Thank you
