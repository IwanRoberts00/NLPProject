Almost every country in the world today has to grapple with the
challenge of population  the growth of the number of older
persons in any society or population 
""
Death appears to be more or less a universal phenomenon and it is
referred to as demographic transition 
""
In the century to come 
will raise many vital and new questions which need to be addressed urgently
""
""
In India for example at present  the number of people in our
society in the sixty plus age group is some fifty-five million 
""
In about thirty years 
two hundred million 
""
The first international conference on aging is to be held and in
fact being held in India
""
At this time  we have with us in our studios today two eminent
experts in the field of aging 
""
May we introduce them to you
""
We have first on my far right  Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale who is
the president of the International Federation 
""
And then we have  immediately to my right Dr K B Gangarade
former Vice  Pro-Vice-Chancellor Delhi University and a United Nation
expert on  aging
""
I can't think of anything else to call your designation  laughs
""
""
""
Quite right
""
""
I use that I for what 
""
Uh may we begin with you Dr  Gokhale
""
There is an International Federation on aging  which is the
moving spirit behind this conference recently being held in Bombay and Pune
""
""
Would you tell us about this International Federation ?
""
""
Yes this federation was established  about twenty-five
years ago 
""
 in membership of this
organization 
""
We have about twenty international agencies which are in membership
of this organization 
""
We are interested  at the policy level which
means  we have research programmes in medical as
well as non-medical subjects 
""
We have publications  or the
grass-root programmes 
where we provide the necessary technical know-how 
""
And we also act  which is consulted by the
United Nations 
""
That is what is the broad description of this 
""
""
Dr Gokhale there is also an Indian Federation of Aging 
 what about this organization ?
""
""
""
""
""
Indian Federation of Aging was started about five years ago
""
""
They are interested in developing old age homes 
""
But old age home is a concept which is becoming out of date 
""
So now they are developing day care centres 
""
They also have their own publication called 
Kanchan-Kalp 
""
They also relate to a number of voluntary organizations in the
country  which are working in the field of aging
""
They co-ordinate them 
""
They are also in the area of development of policy  and
advocates 
""
That is briefly the role of the Indian Federation of Aging 
""
And in addition to Indian Federation there are other five-member
agencies such as  in
Delhi 
""
""
Dr Gangarade  uh you are an expert on aging again Sudhir
before you take over 
""
""
As a expert
""
""
But there is a global dimension  to this demographic
transition through which so many societies are passing 
""
 jitne bhi samaj hai lagta hai
ke jo 
""
What are the global dimensions of this issue  ?
""
""
Let me tell you first 
eighty-six percent of the  will be found only in the Asian
region 
""
We can say dimension of the Asian region 
""
If you take the whole world as such  about fifty-six percent of
the people old in the 
""
From that particular point of view  ninteen-eighty to two
thousand  that the population of the old people
""
""
In fact if you take third world as such 
somewhere there is a very good formula  third age
""
""
""
""
Well you see  the kind of changes
which were odd in the  the old people
""
""
In fact modernization  a kind of a curse to the
old people 
""
Both  as well as in
""
""
In the western society  because he
is a productive element 
""
But 
dis 
""
That he is not a productive market 
""
So whatever we hear  that whenever we talk of the
old age  that the concept of aging must
change  who may have what I
call the functional age 
""
That even after the age of hundred years 
""
We can have a number of example that before eighty eighty-five 
the  active than on the
fortieth 
""
There may be some people 
""
For it is it is not a chronological age that becomes important 
""
But what is the age become important personal age 
""
So to what extent you can  functionally important
 youngster living the sixty year fifty
year age the retirement age
""
Because what we call  not the reason of old but he
is retired because of the chronological age 
""
So they all  problem
is  as a
productive agent of the society
""
Thereby  thereby they retained
their spirit 
""
""
Dr Gangarade may I interrupt at this stage 
""
As far as I can see it there are two  primary causes for this
 of demographic transition about old people in
society
""
The first would be  declining fertility rate and the second
possibly 
""
That being so  country's
 socio-economic structure of this phenomenon of aging ?
""
 ask Dr Gangarade
""
""
The most important point to remember  let us identify three
factors which are  which are very important
""
""
Okay 
""
""
One is  Indian society
itself
""
At one time there was no occupational difference  between the
old and the young 
""
Whatever the father did the 
""
Now with the technological change  there is a lot of
occupational differences 
""
Similarly with the migration  some time old people remains in
the 
""
So that is 
""
Third is also our individualistic way of life is also gradually
""
""
To that extent the first socio-economic problem is  what I call
it if you take into 
""
If an old person is physically sound  if the old person is also
economically 
""
Socially and mentally if he is also alert  then that old person
becomes a wanted person 
""
But if you minus each of these  than becomes an unwanted person
""
""
But what happens even a let us say in our society  where still
the relationships are certainly maintained 
""
Because even if you see  uh younger
may not like the older people  but the older people wants to remain with
their grand children 
""
That kind of emotional tie is is remaining there 
""
So but  the kind of inflation which is taking place all-round
when I use the word all-round  see in a city the housing
problem etcetera 
""
So sometimes the younger people begin to feel  either the old
people should remain in the village  soon
as possible 
""
To give you a very concrete example  in one of my surveys I
found 
""
If after fourth day remains  in-laws that
is daughter  otherwise son-in-law begins to feel there is something wrong
somewhere and he must 
""
So even the father is not  welcome to
""
Why ?
""
Because firstly the scarcity of the space in the  in the house
""
""
Secondly also because now- a-days  prices are
high 
""
Economically it is not possible 
""
But what happens is why sometimes they are welcoming  when they
both are working wife and husband 
""
Sometime they feel  so that
they can do baby-sitting job 
""
So the  most perhaps they begin to
feel 
""
""
Dr Sharadchandra Gokhale  agala prashna apke liye hai
""
""
""
""
""
""
 Kisi bhi samaj ki kisi bhi desh ki arthik vyavasta jo
hai uspar kya prabhav padta hai is 
""
I  little
reluctant to refer to it as a problem
""
 an
issue 
""
So  will be the
impact on the economic health of the country  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Basically Deepakjee  you have a large
population of people of sixty plus age group or age bracket  the
dependency ratio starts increasing 
""
Many thereby should take the 
continuation 
""
There are more people at the younger age who depend on the people
who earn 
""
Similarly there is a larger group of people above the age of sixty
""
""
Which means  on the
earnings of fewer people 
""
Which is a basically 
""
And countries like Japan  are really facing this problem very
""
""
The other issue is  graduity or
social security 
""
Social security  presently is only for the organized sector of
society 
unorganized  small
farmer 
""
So how to provide security to these groups is another issue 
""
And thirdly most of the countries in the West  are finding
 meet the needs of the
people who are sixty plus 
""
And therefore they are finding or searching for new ways 
whereby pension could be replaced  by some funding while they are earning
""
""
Also the other issue related to this  uh uh by pension and
provident fund etcetera 
""
Now the  uh most of the countries in the West are trying to
encourage people  to take up a new assignment at the age of forty
""
They can change jobs 
""
And lastly  they are trying to prepare people for so called
retirement 
""
They start giving the person one day off at the age of fifty-five
""
""
At the age of fifty-six they will give him two days off like that
 to change job
""
""
""
""
""
In other words  at
the age at which the person withdraws from the labour force  should this
be after discussion of some agency like the government  or of the
individual himself
""
""
It has got to be with the individual  and not with any
government 
""
Because whether you are able to work or not  is something you
can decide 
""
In India for example a businessman doesn't 
""
""
Farmers doesn't retire  and politicians you know they just
don't retire 
""
So point is if a person feels that he should retire  certainly
he should retire 
""
But if he feels that he can work  I I remember Deepak mm mm
 incident recently
""
One of my collegues in the UN retired  uh and I was asking his
wife  when the husband is in the home ?
""
And she said  I had a full time
salary 
""
And now I have a part-time salary and full time husband 
which is 
""
""
Dr Gangarade 
""
 Kai aise sawal hai aaj hamare sansar mei jahan yeh dekha
jara hai ke mahilaye jo hain woh  purushon ki apeksha unka jo jeevan hai
wo jyada lamba hota hai 
ab iska kya asar padhta hai samaj par 
""
""
 jo aap
""
""
Dekhye jo  hota hai woh bhi karib karib
chaar 
""
Nahi usne kaam nahi kiya hai usne  ko
 ka ye jaroor
hota hai  society must also
reciprocate him 
""
 Dekhye jo is wakht hamara jo khas sawal is prakar ka hai
 world
""
""
It is not only the money which is important  but what is
important is 
""
Without the work 
""
Without the work men feels some vaccum kind of it 
""
As Dr Gokhale was saying  as I said
again to repeat in my own study  I found a person who retired from the
government service 
""
By ten  go in his
study-room 
""
Whatever the files he had 
laughs 
""
""
He gets into a particular kind of routine
""
""
Whole organization get disturbed 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So so one of his routinisation  like you said the wife
will have no problem 
""
""
Dr Gokhale now this conference that is going on right at this
time  uh really we should have talked about it a little earlier
""
But then in the morning show we are different from the rest so 
we have just a couple of minutes left 
""
Now what are issues that you are discussing in this conference  ?
""
""
You see there are  uh major issues pertaining to aging
that are being discussed
""
Such as 
""
You see out of the total disable population in the world  sixty
percent people are elder 
""
So we would like to discuss that 
""
We would like to discuss the issues regarding social security 
for the elderly population 
""
We would like to discuss indigenious health services such as
 system
""
What can they do  for aging ?
""
""
""
But more than that we are going to discuss the subject  of the
rights and the responsibilities of elderly 
""
A charter that was discussed  at the economic and social
council of UN  and
subsequently it will go to United Nations 
""
That is a very important subject that we have to discuss 
""
And of course in addition to this there would be a number of 
subjects number of lectures etcetra
""
""
And finally 
one or two words 
""
What do you expect  ?
""
""
We are really 
""
Number one 
""
You know presently people  that aging is a
problem 
""
We want to change it 
they must be ready 
they must be productive 
""
So the change of emphasis 
""
Secondly what we want  is an acceptance of the charter of the
rights of the elderly 
""
And thirdly what we want  is to prepare a kind of a blue print
of action  where we need not uproot the people
from their family  but make them live in their families and be productive
""
""
""
Well I would just like to add here
""
""
Sir
""
""
Most important point the conference will arrive at it 
""
The care of the elderly is in the home that is in his own family
""
""
And unless the community and the family participates in the care
of the old  it will be very
difficult for any other agencies to take care of it 
""
I would also like to quote here  that Robert Browning has very
beautifully said  the best thing yet to
be 
""
""
Wonderfull 
""
Dr Gokhale  Dr Gangarade thank you very much for being with us
in our studios and as you have heard that this vital issue of aging is going
to be discussed at this conference
""
There will be greater international awareness after it 
""
And there is also hope for people like me in a couple of hundred
years when 
not be considered as burden or a problem
""
But  uh still a productive force
""
Well thank you very much gentlemen for being with us
""
Thank you
