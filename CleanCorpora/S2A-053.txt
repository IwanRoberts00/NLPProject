Okay now 
and this has a lot of hardware inside and also  ROM there
is software 
""
So the several commands we feed in it takes in and processes or do
""
""
And 
it's 
""
Then this is the monitor  of two fifty-six colour
shade monitor 
""
You can see the  uh mike on
""
""
Mike
""
""
Microphone is on uh  his name ?
""
""
Last man
""
""
Now who is the last man  ?
""
""
Uh Anupam 
""
""
 in
a 
""
Uh uh 
""
Uhm this is a very sensitive  it can give
you two hundred and fifty-six grades of colour 
""
Compared with a V G E monitor which you see usually a good monitor
which gives you four shades 
""
We get uh nice uh this thing and  a flat screen too
""
""
 a flat screen
""
""
And this also could also be connected to a computer
""
Right now  these guys are trying and not able to
succeed 
""
You can operate certain things from the computer 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uhm  all the
controls are at the front panel 
""
There are some controls at the back panel but they have to be 
used 
""
Output  there are certain outputs that could be taken from the
back panel 
""
Here  and this
is the output 
""
You input speech  you can also get the output
of the sound 
""
Usually  the output comes
through the speakers which are connected at the back 
""
You can also listen through a headphone here 
""
The inputting is done  you can choose
two channels 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And then 
""
When you are recording through a microphone  you have to insert
this into the microphone here 
""
This this is channel one 
""
This is for microphone and this is for auxilary that is tape
recorder and such purpose 
""
""
It will be higher voltage input 
""
""
And similarly the other two 
""
You also select your input level  it is at thirty degree which
is a comfortable 
""
You can also increase it 
and it becomes 
""
See 
hello 
""
""
""
So we go down to thirty 
""
Now 
""
Let me get out of that  takes time to display
""
""
Yeah 
""
This is the convention spectrogram  that has bottom of the layer
""
""
So  either through
microphone or through the auxiliary input 
""
And then  you
have to be in record mode 
""
Once you press this one this is a very sacred button 
""
If you press anything here whatever is recored gets erased  as
there is this  continously
records and erases 
""
As it proceeds it goes in a circle 
""
So 
recording is going on 
I'm 
""
Now to stop it  and to preserve that signal I have to press this
knob 
""
And then always that enhance is necessary comes you just press this
button E 
""
Now the settings have been changed let me 
""
""
 yeah
""
I have increased the input level here  you
can see the difference in the  the amplitude is getting
displayed there 
""
Now when I decrease it to thirty you will see that it becomes less
""
""
Okay  uh sometimes
it becomes a bit loud 
""
What we can get here 
""
Right now what we have chosen a spectrogram at the bottom 
screen and the 
""
So  akka
""
""
In fact there is a clipping here  this kind of straight line
means  that clipping is going
on 
""
That clipping is going on 
""
Clipping means 
overloading 
""
You can see that 
""
So we should not be too close there 
""
So  this is
quite 
""
Uh  akka
 you can get a few points in this
""
I mean the interesting points you can see there 
""
One thing is you can see  it is something like I produce
something like a sentence  with a pitch falling
 and
here too  the distance between pulse to pulse is becoming more and more
 in a given period of time so the
pitch is less 
""
And we can do many many things with this signal here 
""
 put some cursors now this this brings cursors in and
out 
""
So the cursors give you the facility to measure
""
Let me shift them  the red
cursor  shift it to the upper screen
""
""
Now there  not one
cursor there is a green cursor behind it 
""
Just we are moving this moves the cursors 
""
By moving it  both the cursors
separated  is three point six five
something  the
""
""
Yeah  point one three
""
So this  has come out
as point one three four one three 
""
We can use this 
""
Let me expand this very form but as  in two contract
form
""
So I can go back to time access  and select the time
access  I activate
that 
enhanced now 
""
Yeah it will rewrite 
""
Redraw that  still this we have
to enhance 
""
So I say enhanced  it has redrawn in an
expanded way 
""
What I can do is I can precisely measure  of the
closure  akka
""
""
Okay now this store business is that it makes the cursors 
where it converts the red and green to green and red 
""
It has the only the red cursor moves the green cursor does not move
""
""
So if I want  move this cursor I have to have it in red
colour 
""
If I want to move this first I have to  then I
can move it 
""
Or if I want to move back  convert into red and then move it
""
""
Okay now  that
is the maintaining  the closure period
of the K in 
""
That is point one nine second  seconds
""
""
Point two seconds 
""
So  immediately you can get the measurement of the durations
""
""
I want to measure the duration of this 
as opposed this 
""
 point one seconds
""
""
And then  and somewhere roughly
there  that was hundred
milli-seconds 
okay 
""
""
""
See what is the difference between the 
shwa  karto
""
""
This is a 
means you do the work 
""
""
And it is phonetically 
""
""
a 
""
Uhn  point
one eight 
""
This is 
""
""
This is  this is K is
here 
simply 
""
In fact you can hear that  you can choose a particular portion
here how it sounds  or indeed the head phones otherwise it will disturb
everybody and you know if you go on playing that 
""
And then this is  me kaam karto
""
""
Now this is the 
 fading away
""
""
Fading out 
""
Now here 
okay  is point
zero seven 
""
So this way immediate measurement you can get  and if you have
let us say hundred or  just transfer them
one by one 
""
There is a  buffer also
""
And you can choose the buffer size 
""
Now sometimes you have a doubt  where a particular
segment started and where a 
stopped 
""
We have both systems 
""
Let me realign them 
""
Okay 
 you can see this this is spectogram of the same thing I gave the same
signal in both the screens  and this is the
sound spectogram 
""
Sound spectogram  two
dimensional 
""
And here  that means change in
colour 
""
You see the F one  and each vertical
slash let me explain this 
""
Okay now  one
after another corresponding to this pulses  each slashes is one lot of
pulse 
""
You can make it even even uh 
""
Now  how the pulses look like
""
""
Look at each pulse 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Each pulse 
""
So it is like that 
""
Then 
""
""
You can see the formant transition 
""
""
""
This is falling down to 
 has that S two rise S two
fall 
""
Uhn so those make you about what is a formant  just
immediately show you what it is
""
Let me 
""
""
""
Now 
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
Take the 
""
Vowel 
at around 
""
Second spectral peek 
""
So this is the usual configuration 
""
""
""
""
""
Oh 
""
""
""
""
""
This is an expanded we can see each  each pitch pulse
""
""
And then the information  you can pick up one
glottal pulse 
""
Okay  it's
 what we call
F one 
and the second spectral peak you know here it may be difficult for you to
follow let me change the colour 
""
Okay 
and you can see the central point there 
that's  two fifty hertz is the first
spectral peak of the 
""
First form of the F one is at two fifty hertz 
""
This is spectrum  after you know you do this
enhance for your analyses you get the spectrum 
""
Then the second spectral peak  is here you can see it
visually 
""
This guy that is the second formant  which will correspond this
peak you know both of them are moving in the similar  they are moving
together 
""
This is again 
""
If you look at ledger if you remember ledger of this chart of F
one F two F three 
""
And this third one has got a split there actually third and fourth
are 
""
Oh 
""
Third and fourth is a 
""
I don't know I I think it shift aside 
""
Ah this is a better one yeah 
""
Let me clear this 
""
Now here 
""
Now there is the fourth formant 
""
So first form and second third fourth  first second third
fourth 
""
Now 
""
Remember 
""
Let me produce a  and see what
happens to that 
""
Yeah 
the 
""
So that F one F two F three F four 
you can see the each formant  not only by
looking at this if you want much precise measurement you can do it by this
spectrum 
""
This is the spectrum of the signal at that red cursor 
""
If you want spectrum  over a period of time
""
""
""
""
Now you need two cursors now  power suppose I want to have an
averaged  I simply press
D 
""
So 
""
But you can even analyse pitch pulse by pulse here  pulse by
pulse you can analyse here 
""
So  characteristics of different vowels
""
""
