<I>
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is software 
""
So the several commands we feed in it takes in and processes or do
""
""
And 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now who is the last man  ?
""
""
Uh Anupam 
""
""
 in
""
""
Uh uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 a flat screen
""
""
And this also could also be connected to a computer
""
""
succeed 
""
You can operate certain things from the computer 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uhm  all the
controls are at the front panel 
""
There are some controls at the back panel but they have to be 
used 
""
Output  there are certain outputs that could be taken from the
""
""
Here  and this
""
""
""
""
""
Usually  the output comes
""
""
You can also listen through a headphone here 
""
""
two channels 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And then 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You also select your input level  it is at thirty degree which
is a comfortable 
""
You can also increase it 
and it becomes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
there is this  continously
""
""
As it proceeds it goes in a circle 
""
So 
""
I'm 
""
Now to stop it  and to preserve that signal I have to press this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 yeah
""
I have increased the input level here  you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In fact there is a clipping here  this kind of straight line
""
on 
""
""
""
""
overloading 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  akka
""
""
I mean the interesting points you can see there 
""
""
something like a sentence  with a pitch falling
""
""
""
""
""
And we can do many many things with this signal here 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
something  the
""
""
Yeah  point one three
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
form
""
So I can go back to time access  and select the time
access  I activate
""
""
""
""
""
Redraw that  still this we have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay now this store business is that it makes the cursors 
""
""
It has the only the red cursor moves the green cursor does not move
""
""
""
""
""
""
can move it 
""
""
""
""
""
is the maintaining  the closure period
""
""
That is point one nine second  seconds
""
""
""
""
So  immediately you can get the measurement of the durations
""
""
""
as opposed this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
okay 
""
""
""
""
shwa  karto
""
""
This is a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn  point
""
""
""
""
""
""
here 
simply 
""
""
here how it sounds  or indeed the head phones otherwise it will disturb
""
""
And then this is  me kaam karto
""
""
""
 fading away
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
one by one 
""
There is a  buffer also
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
signal in both the screens  and this is the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay now  one
""
pulse 
""
You can make it even even uh 
""
Now  how the pulses look like
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Each pulse 
""
So it is like that 
""
Then 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 has that S two rise S two
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
Take the 
""
Vowel 
""
""
Second spectral peek 
""
So this is the usual configuration 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
glottal pulse 
""
""
 what we call
""
""
follow let me change the colour 
""
""
""
that's  two fifty hertz is the first
""
""
First form of the F one is at two fifty hertz 
""
""
enhance for your analyses you get the spectrum 
""
Then the second spectral peak  is here you can see it
visually 
""
""
""
""
""
This is again 
""
If you look at ledger if you remember ledger of this chart of F
""
""
And this third one has got a split there actually third and fourth
are 
""
Oh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
Remember 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
looking at this if you want much precise measurement you can do it by this
spectrum 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
""
pulse you can analyse here 
""
So  characteristics of different vowels
""
""
