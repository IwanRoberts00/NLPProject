<I>
 It's moving 
 It's moving okay 
Okay now cough this is the D S P Sonograph 
and this has a lot of hardware inside and also in it's ROM there
is software 
So the several commands we feed in it takes in and processes or do
 done through this software which is built-in in it 
And it's a special special purpose you can say 
it's a special purpose computer 
Then this is the monitor it's of two fifty-six colour
shade monitor 
You can see the I have to get the uh mike on
Mike
Microphone is on uh what's his name ?
Last man
Now who is the last man ?
Uh Anupam 
 Anupam's table is there in a in a in
a package you can pick it up 
Uh uh hello 
Uhm this is a very sensitive uhm uh monitor it can give
you two hundred and fifty-six grades of colour 
Compared with a V G E monitor which you see usually a good monitor
which gives you four shades 
We get uh nice uh this thing and it's a flat screen too
 It's not protruding this way it's a flat screen
 monitor 
And this also could also be connected to a computer
Right now laughs these guys are trying and not able to
succeed that's another problem they have 
You can operate certain things from the computer 
Yeah 
Uhm there are we should look at this all the
controls are at the front panel 
There are some controls at the back panel but they have to be 
used very rarely for a initial setting sense on 
Output there are certain outputs that could be taken from the
back panel 
Here you have this this is the input section and this
is the output section 
You input speech or any sound you can also get the output
of the sound 
Usually it is if you don't mute it the output comes
through the speakers which are connected at the back 
You can also listen through a headphone here 
The inputting is done you have two channels you can choose
two channels channel one and channel two 
Yeah 
And then first do the recording 
When you are recording through a microphone you have to insert
this into the microphone here 
This this is channel one this is channel two 
This is for microphone and this is for auxilary that is tape
recorder and such purpose 
It will be higher voltage input 
And similarly the other two cough 
You also select your input level it is at thirty degree which
is a comfortable input level 
You can also increase it to seventy seventy is the maximum 
and it becomes you can see that it is getting over loaded 
See even it's picking up from here 
hello hello hello 
 That's too much actually 
So we go down to thirty 
Now it's not so sensitive 
Let me get out of that actually that takes time to display
Yeah hello 
This is the convention spectrogram that has bottom of the layer
 and the top one is a it's in a wave form 
So you can input it here from here either through
microphone or through the auxiliary input 
And then okay for inputting you have to do record you
have to be in record mode 
Once you press this one this is a very sacred button 
If you press anything here whatever is recored gets erased as
there is this it's a circular buffer is there continously
records and erases 
As it proceeds it goes in a circle 
So once I press this it's now recording 
recording is going on recording is going on right now whatever 
I'm saying is going inside and it is being kept inside 
Now to stop it and to preserve that signal I have to press this
knob 
And then always that enhance is necessary comes you just press this
button E it will do the enhancement on its own 
Now the settings have been changed let me come back 
 go back to my settings cough 
 Hello yeah
I have increased the input level here to forty degree you
can see the difference in the the way the amplitude is getting
displayed there 
Now when I decrease it to thirty you will see that it becomes less
 and twenty still less 
Okay forty forty is quite comfortable in fact uh sometimes
it becomes a bit loud 
What we can get here is a continous spect 
Right now what we have chosen a spectrogram at the bottom 
screen and the wave form at the top screen 
So let's say something like akka
 
In fact there is a clipping here this kind of straight line
means there is too much space means too loud that clipping is going
on 
That clipping is going on which should be avoided 
Clipping means it's it's it's called overloading 
overloading 
You can see that it's it's clipping here too 
So we should not be too close there 
So akka akka this is
quite comfortable cough 
Uh just if you take this signal akka
 here you can you can get a few points in this
I mean the interesting points you can see there 
One thing is you can see it is something like I produce
something like a sentence a declarative sentence with a pitch falling
 you see the pulses are going down becoming separated here and
here too the distance between pulse to pulse is becoming more and more
 that means your pulses in in a in a given period of time so the
pitch is less 
And we can do many many things with this signal here 
 Let's put some cursors now this this brings cursors in and
out okay 
So the cursors give you the facility to measure
Let me shift them now they are on the lower screen the red
cursor I'll shift them to a shift it to the upper screen
Now there you see a red cursor but that's not one
cursor there is a green cursor behind it 
Just we are moving this moves the cursors 
By moving it okay you get the both the cursors
separated the reading at the red cursor is three point six five
something reading of the green one is three point five the
 dif the difference is point one three 
Yeah okay point one three
So this duration between these two cursors has come out
as point one three four one three four four seconds 
We can use this kind of information 
Let me expand this very form but as it's in two contract
form
So I can go back to time access okay and select the time
access and the upper screen this is my upper screen I activate
that small knob there and make it expanded and it's 
enhanced now 
Yeah it will rewrite 
Redraw that I unselect I unselect still this we have
to enhance 
So I say enhanced it has enhanced it has redrawn in an
expanded way okay 
What I can do is I can precisely measure the length of the
closure the length of the closure of K in akka
 
Okay now this store business is that it makes the cursors 
where it converts the red and green to green and red 
It has the only the red cursor moves the green cursor does not move
So if I want to move this cursor I have to have it in red
colour 
If I want to move this first I have to make it red then I
can move it 
Or if I want to move back convert into red and then move it
Okay now roughly that is the time taken for the K to that
is the maintaining that's it due that's the closure period
of the K in akka 
That is point one nine second roughly point two seconds
 okay 
Point two seconds cough 
So immediately you can get the measurement of the durations
I want to measure the duration of this aa 
as opposed this aa 
 That's very easy point one point one seconds
And then somewhere roughly there and somewhere roughly
there it's point point one four seconds that was hundred
milli-seconds and this is hundred and forty-seven milli-seconds 
okay 
 Let's take a word two words in Marathi 
See what is the difference between the so called 
shwa vowel there kara kar karto
 kar karto 
This is a kar tu kar 
means you do the work imperative form of kar 
 
And it is phonetically shwa 
 It's not a long shwaa it's 
a shwa 
Uhn let's look at it's length point
one eight point one eight four six 
This is aa of 
 kar 
This is a this is K is
here you can't see K this a 
simply a okay 
In fact you can hear that you can choose a particular portion
here how it sounds or indeed the head phones otherwise it will disturb
everybody and you know if you go on playing that 
And then this is karto me kaam karto
 let's say 
Now this is the now this is the K closure 
 a a ki closure O fading away
Fading out 
Now here remember that was point one eight four seconds 
okay kar a this guy is point
zero seven okay almost half 
So this way immediate measurement you can get and if you have
let us say hundred or hundred two hundred samples just transfer them
one by one 
There is a you can have a large uh buffer also
And you can choose the buffer size and measure them 
Now sometimes you have a doubt about where a particular
segment started and where a seg segment 
stopped let's say ended 
We have both systems 
Let me realign them 
Okay this is the kar 
 you can see this this is spectogram of the same thing I gave the same
signal in both the screens this is the wave form and this is the
sound spectogram cough 
Sound spectogram is a is a two
dimensional thing 
And here you can see the formants that means change in
colour 
You see the F one F two F three F four and each vertical
slash let me explain this you will see this 
Okay now it's clear you can see the slash one
after another corresponding to this pulses each slashes is one lot of
pulse 
You can make it even even uh more a 
Now let's watch how the how the pulses look like
Look at each pulse each pulse 
Yeah 
Each pulse 
So it is like that 
Then uh we come back go back to 
 the original earlier one 
You can see the formant transition this is the 
 aa and going higher going into 
 ra 
This is falling down to ra 
 as ra has that S two rise S two
fall kind of thing 
Uhn so those make you about what is a formant I'll just
immediately show you what it is
Let me invoke another module 
 It's a rerecorded the signal is a bit loud here 
Now cough because of this 
Yeah 
 I'll rerecord this signal 
Take the let's take the vowel e 
Vowel e has the first spectral peak 
at around two hundred fifty hertz 
Second spectral peek should be around two thousands hertz 
So this is the usual configuration 
 Let's see how it looks like 
 ee ee okay 
Oh that's just a minute 
 ee ee 
 That's good 
This is an expanded we can see each uh each pitch pulse
 each has a pulse here 
And then the information uh of that you can pick up one
glottal pulse 
Okay it's a bit loud here and see it's
 you can actually get the measurements of the what we call
F one conventionally call F one that is the first spectral peak 
and the second spectral peak you know here it may be difficult for you to
follow let me change the colour 
Okay okay this the spectral peak first spectral peak 
and you can see the central point there and it is two forty hertz 
that's the standard text book you saw two fifty hertz is the first
spectral peak of the e 
First form of the F one is at two fifty hertz 
This is spectrum spectrum after you know you do this
enhance for your analyses you get the spectrum 
Then the second spectral peak is is here you can see it
visually 
This guy that is the second formant which will correspond this
peak you know both of them are moving in the similar they are moving
together both the cursors this two three six zero 
This is again a text book case okay 
If you look at ledger if you remember ledger of this chart of F
one F two F three 
And this third one has got a split there actually third and fourth
are bit 
Oh 
Third and fourth is a are bit merged 
I don't know I I think it shift aside yeah 
Ah this is a better one yeah 
Let me clear this uh let me clear this guy yeah 
Now here see that the fourth spectral peak is here 
Now there is the fourth formant 
So first form and second third fourth first second third
fourth okay 
Now let's go back to the second spectral peak here 
Remember it's two three two zero 
Let me produce a an aa and see what
happens to that aa aa aa 
Yeah the F F three F two has come so low compared to 
the this one it has come down to eight forty 
So that F one F two F three F four the movement of these 
you can see the each formant you can precisely measure not only by
looking at this if you want much precise measurement you can do it by this
spectrum 
This is the spectrum of the signal at that red cursor 
If you want spectrum of this signal over a period of time
 you have another choice power between cursors 
 It's a power actually okay 
Now you need two cursors now power suppose I want to have an
averaged spectrum of this I put the cursors there I simply press
D it'll come there 
So it's over a larger period 
But you can even analyse pitch pulse by pulse here pulse by
pulse you can analyse here 
So ao characteristics of different vowels
 could be analysed by looking at their formant characteristics
