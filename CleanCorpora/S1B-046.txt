Today 
""
And  on
various aspects of uh  modern research which is going on in the Biology
""
""
Prof Das  in
Jawaharlal Nehru University 
""
And currently  uh Centre for
Biotechnology  in the same university that is Jawaharlal Nehru University
""
""
Prof Das  the
background or the history  in India
 ?
""
""
Yes uh bb I think it will be  interesting to trace back the
history 
""
Uhm  uh Prof
M G K Menon 
uh 
""
Trying to discuss  should
receive thrust 
""
And  uh had emphasised
 running out of time and we should initiate genetic
engineering research in India
""
You see prior to that  had
always felt that genetic engineering  it
cannot be done in India 
""
It can be done only in the highly developed countries 
""
But 
nothing so sophisticated in genetic engineering or recombinant in technology
 uh in our country
""
Uh and 
""
And uh  Science and
Technology uh  to
initiate genetic engineering research in India
""
Uh 
 units were established
""
One  uhm
another in Bose Institute Calcutta  and the third one in Jawaharlal Nehru
University 
""
Later another unit was added and uh  in Madurai
 Kamraj University
""
Uh  they should serve as a focal point
""
""
So that  people from the nearby area could come and learn the
techniques  can spread in the country
""
""
Uh you know this has worked very well
""
Now  good biological laboratories in the
country 
""
But 
""
""
Uh coming to the next one 
""
In fact I wanted to ask you after this  brief background which
is not a very 
""
Eighty-two is not far off 
""
What is the current status of genetic engineering research  uh
in India or in  ?
""
""
Uh uh  is is a very encouraging I
must say
""
And uh  to what I was saying
""
Uh  each of these centres three units of genetic engineering uh
 entrusted with the job of doing a particular kind of genetic
engineering research  in the country
""
Uhm  Jawaharlal Nehru University was
supposed to work on 
""
""
You have mentioned that your unit  of which you are the
director  responsibility of uh carrying out
research  on nitrogen fixation
""
""
""
""
""
So uh  will you elaborate a little bit what is nitrogen
fixation ?
""
Because we keep hearing about  yes
 and perhaps they have some other
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
The the  uh is
reduction of a molecular nitrogen 
""
And uh when I was a student or you were a student  we've
""
industrially reducing nitrogen
""
Uh  who can
also reduce nitrogen on that
""
Reduce nitrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure
""
You don't have to  uh in the temperature or
pressure 
""
And this micro-organisms  and form amonia
and its derivatives 
""
And 
""
And I don't have to  uh overemphasis the importance of this
because  in
the living world 
""
Like the meat or fish we consume today  uh the the
animals or the fish cannot fix nitrogen 
right  so they get the nitrogen
fixed from the microbes 
""
So  is is the only biological
source in addition to of course the industrially  fixed nitrogen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Fixed nitrogen
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So these nitrogen fixtures  as you say are microbes and
your work  is also related to them
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So uh there may be many  nitrogen
fixing or of many types 
""
""
 uh uhm
""
""
Uh generally speaking 
could  symbiotic
nitrogen fixation 
""
Uh which means that 
cannot fix nitrogen but they must  uh enter into a symbiotic arrangement
""
""
Uh uhm 
I'm  uh is is the one which does it
""
""
""
""
""
""
So uh  would
enter into symbiotic relationship 
except 
""
""
""
""
""
By 
the pulses
""
""
 right
""
""
Uh uh
""
""
Leguminous plants 
one word 
diet consuming 
uh nitrogen
""
""
""
""
""
Nitrogen or protein 
""
""
Even if one is a non-vegetarian  because the cost of
non-vegetarian food is very high
""
So  the general mass of the country would live on vegetarian
dishes 
""
And the pulses are very important suppliers of nitrogen 
""
""
So these risobia  enter into an association
 with these leguminous plants
""
""
""
""
""
And then  what is the benefit of
that association
""
""
I will tell you
""
The form what you call  which can be very small or
slightly big  of these plants
""
And some stray instances of shoot  or stem nodules also
""
But generally speaking root nodules 
""
And as a result  fix nitrogen would be given to
the plant 
""
So that the legumes  form
""
""
Uh fixing atmospheric nitrogen uh by using  these bacterial
species 
""
Uh this is one kind uh
""
There is another kind which we call  associative nitrogen
fixation 
micros  micro-organisms
""
But there is no 
""
And that uh  uh uh fixation of nitrogen
""
""
The cereal plants for 
rice etcetera
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And as a spirillum  uh
which enters into association with cereal plants 
""
There could be a third class where there is no association 
""
The micro organisms can fix nitrogen  in a free living state
""
Doesn't need any plant nothing  is an
example of the third class
""
And  both as a spirillum species and as
agrobactor species are used in the fields  for cereal plants to augument
the crop production
""
And there is absolutely no doubt  impart
beneficial affect to cereal crop production 
""
""
Prof Das you are working on uh 
uh on NDIE  living nitrogen
fixture 
""
So why have you uh  to work out its
genetics or bio fixing ?
""
""
""
""
""
You see uh uh I  basically a bio-chemist
""
And uh  uh
because of 
""
One is that  a
machinery inside a cell 
""
In agrobactor the fixatiion goes on in air 
presence of oxygen 
""
""
""
""
""
So it has its own mechanism  by which it protects the
nitrogen fixation machinery  which is not there in other organisms
""
Uh uh  some organisms can protect but only when some
specialised structures are formed
""
But in agrobactor  does it
""
This was  one very interesting point for us to get interest in
agrobactor 
""
The other point was of course  we wanted to work
with something 
""
Uh because  uh the more
important crop in India
""
Uhm  and of course slowly we have learnt that there are many
other interesting points in agrobactor as we have  worked with agrobactor
""
""
Like it has 
""
Which uh 
uh bacterial species
""
""
So besides uh  pathway for nitrogen
fixation 
""
Uh what are the other uh unique findings  uh
been done in your  lab ?
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Or in under  your directorship ?
""
""
Sure 
""
""
Or you can elaborate that this  is the only thing
which contains everything itself 
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
Agrobactor we have learnt  has another unique
character 
""
Uh and that is it has a huge amount of DNA in it 
""
DNA as you know is the 
uh for a bacteria  uh it is really huge
""
Uh  the micro
organism  in organs
""
 friendly bacteria which synthesises vitamins in us
""
""
And agrobactor has as much as forty times more DNA  in in its
single cell 
""
And  our attention
""
""
""
""
""
""
And we have recently uh uh  established that agrobactor
""
""
Which are almost the size 
chromosome 
""
But uh  uh looks like all of
them are similar 
""
And nobody knows why they are there  and what they are doing
""
""
And this is what  at this present
moment
""
So in addition to the nitrogen  interest that
we have first agrobactor this is also another 
that needs attention in agrobactor 
""
""
Uh these  are
also doing another job that is they are economising on the  fertilizer
requirement  application
in agriculture
""
""
""
""
""
Very much 
""
""
So uh can you please elaborate on 
""
""
""
 you see the most effective
""
""
The effect that you get is is a  in case
of risobium 
""
Uh but the problem with risobium is that  uh you can use it
only  for legumes
""
Or the or the pulses
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Uh  uh
""
And  it it brings up
yield 
""
But 
not as good as  as risobium
""
But again  uh risobium cannot do anything for your cereal crops
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And for cereal crops 
uh again 
""
Not not just in the lab  it gives an
yield somewhere  could be anywhere between ten to forty percent more
""
""
""
""
""
And for some  the yield could be even
double 
""
And specifically only for fodder crops
""
""
""
So you simply  with these bacteria
""
""
""
""
""
""
And there the  and then
supply the nitrogen 
""
And the other point is that it not only  uhm has the good
effect on that crop  also gets the benefit
because 
""
And the next crop also 
of this inoculation 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh since you are  and
dedicated  uh there
previously there was a euphoria of genetic engineering 
""
Now we hear quite often of biotechnology 
""
Uh since you are an expert in this area 
uh is there any distinction between the two or do they overlap  or they
are  one and the same thing
""
""
No uh  Genetic Engineering
is included in biotechnology 
""
Uh the the so much that you hear about biotechnology today  I
dare say  is because of genetic engineering
""
Because  like like the wine that
was there from the time immemorial
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You you you could consider it 
uh uh phenomenon 
""
""
""
""
""
Or even  gas that you hear so
much about  the
genetic engineering  uh development of genetic engineering that has given
a real boost to biotechnology 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh genetic engineering is included in biotechnology but
biotechnology  uh could deal with other things also like tissue culture
""
""
Which is also very important today 
""
Like certain certain plants have been propogated by tissue culture
""
""
And those are disease free plants 
""
And there there is no genetic engineering  but thats included
in biotechnology 
""
Or or even this conventional  is is
biotechnology
""
But I am sure you heard that  you you have better
vaccines  which have been uh constructed using genetic engineering tools
or 
""
""
That means biotechnology was already there  very
much  has hasten
the process of
""
""
""
""
""
 the way I I I would look at
biotechnology today 
""
""
Prof Das do you think that whatever you are doing  or your
group or  do they
have  ?
""
Like your organism for example has 
in agriculture 
""
What are the other areas where we can uhm make best use of this
 or
researches in modern biology
""
""
There can be many examples  and some of these have been
tried abroad 
""
I I I will start with an example which I always give 
that's 
""
You know the uh all diabetics 
""
Now insulin  is naturally made in the pancreas of animals
including us 
""
So  when we fail to make our own insulin we have to take
insulin from outside 
""
And that insulin used to come 
""
So animals would have to be slaughtered  and the insulin would
have to be isolated 
""
Uh so  what they have done is they had projected
the need of insulin 
""
And they have found that they would soon come  when you just
would not able to kill as many animals  uh insulin
""
This is point number one
