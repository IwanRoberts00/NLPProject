Today we've Prof H K Das in the studios 
And we will uh enter into discussion with Prof H K Das on
various aspects of uh modern research which is going on in the Biology
Prof Das is Director of Genetic Engineering Unit in
Jawaharlal Nehru University 
And currently he is the chairman of uh Centre for
Biotechnology in the same university that is Jawaharlal Nehru University
Prof Das I would like to ask you what is uh the
background or the history of Genetic Engineering Research in India
 ?
Yes uh bb I think it will be interesting to trace back the
history 
Uhm you see somewhere around nineteen eighty-two uh Prof
M G K Menon had called some of the Biologists of the country 
uh for a meeting at Baroda 
Trying to discuss as to what are the areas that should
receive thrust for research in India 
And that's where uh people like us uh had emphasised
 that uh we are running out of time and we should initiate genetic
engineering research in India
You see prior to that uh the science administrators had
always felt that genetic engineering is too sophisticated and uh it
cannot be done in India 
It can be done only in the highly developed countries 
But we we could convince Prof Menon that there is nothing 
nothing so sophisticated in genetic engineering or recombinant in technology
 and it can very well be done uh in our country
Uh and he didn't take long to understand the point 
And uh it was decided that the Department of Science and
Technology uh should start some core research units uh to to
initiate genetic engineering research in India
Uh applications were invited and uh that's how 
 a three units were established
One in the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore uhm
another in Bose Institute Calcutta and the third one in Jawaharlal Nehru
University in Delhi 
Later another unit was added and uh that was uh in Madurai
 Kamraj University
Uh the purpose was that they should serve as a focal point
So that people from the nearby area could come and learn the
techniques and genetic engineering research can spread in the country
Uh you know this has worked very well
Now almost in all good biological laboratories in the
country genetic engineering is being used 
But that's how the whole thing was started 
Uh coming to the next one 
In fact I wanted to ask you after this brief background which
is not a very long history for genetic engineering to start in India 
Eighty-two is not far off 
What is the current status of genetic engineering research uh
in India or in it's labs of India ?
Uh uh the current status uh is is a very encouraging I
must say
And uh uhm if I may go back again uhm to what I was saying
Uh each of these centres three units of genetic engineering uh
 was uh entrusted with the job of doing a particular kind of genetic
engineering research in the country
Uhm uhm the unit in Jawaharlal Nehru University was
supposed to work on uh the molecular genetic of nitrogen fixation 
You have mentioned that your unit of which you are the
director is endowed with the responsibility of uh carrying out
research on nitrogen fixation
 That's right 
So uh will you elaborate a little bit what is nitrogen
fixation ?
Because we keep hearing about nitrogen fixing yes
 microbe yes and perhaps they have some other
 Yes 
 Yes 
Yes
The the meaning of nitrogen fixation chemically uh is
reduction of a molecular nitrogen 
And uh when I was a student or you were a student we've
 heard about the Hoberbosh process yeah of uh 
industrially reducing nitrogen
Uh but uh you know there are micro-organisms who can
also reduce nitrogen on that
Reduce nitrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure
You don't have to go very high uh in the temperature or
pressure 
And this micro-organisms uh reduce nitrogen and form amonia
and its derivatives 
And that's what is biological nitrogen fixation 
And I don't have to uh overemphasis the importance of this
because uh uh this is the only source of all nitrogenous compounds in
the living world 
Like the meat or fish we consume today though uh the the
animals or the fish cannot fix nitrogen they live on plants 
right and and the plants cannot fix nitrogen so they get the nitrogen
fixed from the microbes 
So so bb this fixed nitrogen is is the only biological
source in addition to of course the industrially fixed nitrogen
 Yeah 
 Right 
Fixed nitrogen
Yes 
So these nitrogen fixtures as you say are microbes and
your work is also related to them
Yes 
So uh there may be many types of uh nitrogen
fixing or of many types 
 Sure there are many there are many types uh uhm
 if I may classify them 
Uh generally speaking wa you 
could uh uh group them in a classes like symbiotic
nitrogen fixation 
Uh which means that the micro-organisms by themselves 
cannot fix nitrogen but they must uh enter into a symbiotic arrangement
 with a particular plant 
Uh uhm and the genous risobium yeah and uh 
I'm sure this is a very familiar name uh is is the one which does it
 Yeah 
So uh the genous the various species of risobium would
enter into symbiotic relationship with various leguminous plants 
except for one or two plants 
 For one or two plants 
By legu excuse me by leguminous plants you mean 
the pulses
 That's right
Uh uh
Leguminous plants uh uh are are the pulses 
one word yeah and uh since India is uh a a big vegetarian uh 
diet consuming uh country the pulses are very important source of 
uh nitrogen
 One word 
Nitrogen or protein 
Even if one is a non-vegetarian because the cost of
non-vegetarian food is very high
So the general mass of the country would live on vegetarian
dishes 
And the pulses are very important suppliers of nitrogen 
So these risobia they uh enter into an association
 with these leguminous plants
 That's right 
And then the what have what is the benefit of
that association
I will tell you
The form what you call nodules which can be very small or
slightly big in the roots of these plants
And some stray instances of shoot or stem nodules also
But generally speaking root nodules 
And as a result uh a lot of fix nitrogen would be given to
the plant 
So that the legumes uh would fo form
 the crop 
Uh fixing atmospheric nitrogen uh by using these bacterial
species 
Uh this is one kind uh
There is another kind which we call associative nitrogen
fixation where the plant uh would associate themselves with 
micros micro-organisms
But there is no uh uh rigid symbiotic arrangement 
And that uh kind of syn uh uh fixation of nitrogen
 is very important for nonlegumes 
The cereal plants for example like uh we rice 
rice etcetera
 Right 
Uhm uhm
And as a spirillum this is one important genus uh
which enters into association with cereal plants 
There could be a third class where there is no association 
The micro organisms can fix nitrogen in a free living state
Doesn't need any plant nothing and as agrobactor is an
example of the third class
And today in India both as a spirillum species and as
agrobactor species are used in the fields for cereal plants to augument
the crop production
And there is absolutely no doubt that both these uh impart
beneficial affect to cereal crop production 
Prof Das you are working on uh a agrobactor 
uh on NDIE uhm uhm uh which is a free living nitrogen
fixture 
So why have you uh selected this field to work out its
genetics or bio fixing ?
 Uhm uhm 
You see uh uh I I'm I'm basically a bio-chemist
And uh I I had been uh quite attracted by a agrobactor uh
because of uh mainly two reasons 
One is that though in general this nitrogen fixation a
machinery inside a cell is very sensitive to oxygen 
In agrobactor the fixatiion goes on in air in the 
presence of oxygen 
 Yeah yeah 
So it has its own mechanism by which it protects the
nitrogen fixation machinery which is not there in other organisms
Uh uh some organisms can protect but only when some
specialised structures are formed
But in agrobactor the the cell by itself does it
This was one very interesting point for us to get interest in
agrobactor 
The other point was of course that uh we wanted to work
with something that would be useful for cereal crops 
Uh because that's by far uh the uh the more
important crop in India
Uhm and of course slowly we have learnt that there are many
other interesting points in agrobactor as we have worked with agrobactor
Like it has some alternative pathways of nitrogen fixation 
Which uh possibly is not there in the other conventional 
uh bacterial species
So besides uh this alternative pathway for nitrogen
fixation 
Uh what are the other uh unique findings that have uh uh
been done in your lab ?
Uhm
Or in under in your directorship ?
Sure uh uhm 
Or you can elaborate that this is the only thing
which contains everything itself 
 Yes if I can tell everything itself 
Yes 
Agrobactor we have learnt the has another unique
character 
Uh and that is it has a huge amount of DNA in it 
DNA as you know is the is the genetic material and uh 
uh for a bacteria uh it is really huge
Uh the standard in bacteria is considered to be the micro
organism one word which all of us have in the in organs
 It's friendly bacteria which synthesises vitamins in us
And agrobactor has as much as forty times more DNA in in its
single cell 
And that's what has attracted our attention
 Might have one word 
And we have recently uh uh established that agrobactor
 one word has as many as eighty chromosomes in it 
Which are almost the size uh of an one word 
chromosome 
But uh altogether eighty chromosomes uh looks like all of
them are similar 
And nobody knows why they are there and what they are doing
And this is what is of interest to us at this present
moment
So in addition to the nitrogen fixation uh interest that
we have first agrobactor this is also another interesting point uh 
that needs attention in agrobactor 
Uh these microbes that you have talked about are
also doing another job that is they are economising on the fertilizer
requirement of the crop that means it has some application
in agriculture
 That's right 
Very much so very much 
So uh can you please elaborate on on those aspects 
 that's 
 You see uh uh you see the most effective
 the biological fertilizer is of course risobium 
The effect that you get is is a much more striking in case
of risobium 
Uh but the problem with risobium is that uh you can use it
only for legumes
Or the or the pulses
Uhm uhm 
Uh dals that we take uh
And there's absolutely no doubt that it it brings up
yield several wholes high 
But in the case of one word agrobactor it's 
not as good as as risobium
But again uh risobium cannot do anything for your cereal crops
Yeah
And for cereal crops uh it has been established that 
uh again it's in the field 
Not not just in the lab that uh uh it it it gives an
yield somewhere could be anywhere between ten to forty percent more
 Haan 
And for some fodder crops the yield could be even
double 
And specifically only for fodder crops
 Using uhm agrobactor 
So you simply uh inoculate the seed with these bacteria
 and then sow the seed 
 Uhm uhm 
And there the micro organisms multiply and then
supply the nitrogen 
And the other point is that it not only uhm has the good
effect on that crop the crop that comes next also gets the benefit
because some of the fix nitrogen stay on in the soil 
And the next crop also getting gets the benefit 
of this inoculation 
 Gets the benefit 
Uh since you are uh heading such a good and
dedicated scientists team of genetic engineering unit uh there
previously there was a euphoria of genetic engineering 
Now we hear quite often of biotechnology 
Uh since you are an expert in this area can you uh tell us 
uh is there any distinction between the two or do they overlap or they
are one and the same thing
No uh let me put it this way uh Genetic Engineering
is included in biotechnology 
Uh the the so much that you hear about biotechnology today I
dare say is because of genetic engineering
Because biotechnology was there like like the wine that
was there from the time immemorial
Yeah
You you you could consider it as a biotechnological 
uh uh phenomenon yeah preparing a wine 
 Yeah 
Or even the gober gas that you hear so
much about is biotechnology uh but it's the
genetic engineering uh development of genetic engineering that has given
a real boost to biotechnology 
 A few words 
Uh genetic engineering is included in biotechnology but
biotechnology uh could deal with other things also like tissue culture
Which is also very important today 
Like certain certain plants have been propogated by tissue culture
And those are disease free plants 
And there there is no genetic engineering but thats included
in biotechnology 
Or or even this conventional vaccine making is is
biotechnology
But I am sure you heard that now you you have better
vaccines which have been uh constructed using genetic engineering tools
or one word tools 
That means biotechnology was already there very
much but genetic engineering provided uh tools which has hasten
the process of
 Very much 
 That's that's the way I I I would look at
biotechnology today 
Prof Das do you think that whatever you are doing or your
group or genetic engineers are doing in India or all over do they
have any relevance to the people or masses ?
Like your organism for example has uh the direct benefit 
in agriculture 
What are the other areas where we can uhm make best use of this
 uh genetic engineering unit or genetic engineering researches or
researches in modern biology
There can be many examples and some of these have been
tried abroad 
I I I will start with an example which I always give and 
that's the example of human insulin 
You know the uh all diabetics must take insulin 
Now insulin is naturally made in the pancreas of animals
including us 
So when we fail to make our own insulin we have to take
insulin from outside 
And that insulin used to come only from animal pancreas 
So animals would have to be slaughtered and the insulin would
have to be isolated and then processed and we take injection 
Uh so that's what they have done is they had projected
the need of insulin 
And they have found that they would soon come when you just
would not able to kill as many animals to supply the uh insulin
This is point number one
