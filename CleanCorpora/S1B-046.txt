Today 
""
""
various aspects of uh  modern research which is going on in the Biology
""
""
""
""
""
""
Biotechnology  in the same university that is Jawaharlal Nehru University
""
""
Prof Das  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh 
""
""
receive thrust 
""
""
 running out of time and we should initiate genetic
""
""
""
""
cannot be done in India 
""
""
""
""
""
 uh in our country
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 units were established
""
One  uhm
""
University 
""
""
""
""
Uh  they should serve as a focal point
""
""
""
techniques  can spread in the country
""
""
Uh you know this has worked very well
""
""
country 
""
""
""
""
Uh coming to the next one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is the current status of genetic engineering research  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  to what I was saying
""
Uh  each of these centres three units of genetic engineering uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because we keep hearing about  yes
 and perhaps they have some other
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Reduce nitrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure
""
""
""
""
""
and its derivatives 
""
And 
""
And I don't have to  uh overemphasis the importance of this
""
the living world 
""
""
animals or the fish cannot fix nitrogen 
""
fixed from the microbes 
""
So  is is the only biological
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
your work  is also related to them
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
could  symbiotic
""
""
Uh which means that 
""
""
""
""
I'm  uh is is the one which does it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
except 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 right
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh nitrogen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 with these leguminous plants
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But generally speaking root nodules 
""
And as a result  fix nitrogen would be given to
""
""
So that the legumes  form
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
rice etcetera
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
example of the third class
""
""
agrobactor species are used in the fields  for cereal plants to augument
""
""
And there is absolutely no doubt  impart
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
genetics or bio fixing ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  uh
""
""
One is that  a
""
""
In agrobactor the fixatiion goes on in air 
presence of oxygen 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This was  one very interesting point for us to get interest in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh bacterial species
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sure 
""
""
""
which contains everything itself 
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
Agrobactor we have learnt  has another unique
character 
""
""
""
""
uh for a bacteria  uh it is really huge
""
""
organism  in organs
""
""
""
""
And agrobactor has as much as forty times more DNA  in in its
""
""
And  our attention
""
""
""
""
""
""
And we have recently uh uh  established that agrobactor
""
""
""
chromosome 
""
But uh  uh looks like all of
""
""
And nobody knows why they are there  and what they are doing
""
""
""
""
""
""
we have first agrobactor this is also another 
""
""
""
""
also doing another job that is they are economising on the  fertilizer
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of risobium 
""
""
only  for legumes
""
Or the or the pulses
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
yield 
""
""
not as good as  as risobium
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
yield somewhere  could be anywhere between ten to forty percent more
""
""
""
""
""
""
double 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And there the  and then
supply the nitrogen 
""
""
""
""
""
And the next crop also 
of this inoculation 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh since you are  and
""
""
""
""
""
Uh since you are an expert in this area 
""
are  one and the same thing
""
""
No uh  Genetic Engineering
is included in biotechnology 
""
""
dare say  is because of genetic engineering
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
much about  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Like certain certain plants have been propogated by tissue culture
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
or 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 the way I I I would look at
""
""
""
""
group or  do they
""
""
Like your organism for example has 
""
""
What are the other areas where we can uhm make best use of this
""
""
""
""
There can be many examples  and some of these have been
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  when we fail to make our own insulin we have to take
""
""
And that insulin used to come 
""
""
have to be isolated 
""
""
the need of insulin 
""
""
would not able to kill as many animals  uh insulin
