<I>
Uhm Mr Yadav you told something about your native
place na 
Yeah
Which is your native place 
Native Place is uh U P Azamgarh 
Oh I see 
So when did you finish your M A degree 
In fact I finished my M A some uh from the University
of Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 
Uhm I see 
That means uh you finished it in the university itself 
Which year could you tell me the year 
Yeah 
Right in nineteen eighty-seven 
After that what have you been doing since then 
Infact after uh in uh nineteen eighty-seven almost uh
 in July I got my degree M A degree
And uh after that I taught in a college almost for four year
uh four months and uh of course and uh after that 
since it was a private college and uh I didn't hope much from
this college 
And meanwhile fortunately I got a job in state
government school and uh I took up this job now I'm 
going on with this job 
 Oh is that 
Uh uh are you happy with this present job 
 It's all it laughs to a certain extent
 uh I'm happy 
But since it's a very interior part of uh Jabalpur
city 
So sometimes I don't find uhm me at ease 
Eh in the in the sense it was uh high I'm 
appointed there as a English teacher uh but things are quite
different there
I don't find people who can uh speak with me in
English ah or even whenever I teach in in the classes uh
I quiet often I used by mother tongue Hindi
So from uh my part I like something that
uh 
 Ah 
 It means uh since you do not get the
opportunity to use English outside the classroom or even inside the
classroom you are not fully satisfied with the present Job 
 Oh yeah well I'm not uh fully satisfied
 because in fact uh English is a second language for me and 
uh unless uh we uh take up or continue with the uhm unless
we follow the uhm four available skills of learning second language 
then I don't think it will be better for a learner to develop or uh
Okay I understand that
Now since you are doing the P G C T now after going back
 is it possible for you to use simple English in the classroom itself
Yeah I would like to uhm use simple English as
much as uh possible 
Since uh student there where I teach they're 
not able to understand uh even simple sentences 
But even then I would like to do uhm my best particularly
I would like to use English sentences simple sentences
So that uh they can uh make an effort to understand the
sentences 
Yeah that's what I also feel better because 
to to begin with you can use simple English simple sentences
And uh after one month or so on after one month or so 
you can increase the standard step by step 
And I think you'll be successful in using English inside
the classroom also 
And when you meet some friends when you go here and there to
different places you can use uh English and so I think uh you
can improve a lot 
Then what's your future plan 
That is uh to continue the school or to search for another job 
Well uhm infact uh I need a lot of improvement 
particularly in my spoken English and uh particularly
pronunciation stress intonation and uh there're uh
other fields of English there I find myself uh uhm but I
realise that uh I lack something 
So my next plan would be eh to take up Diploma course from
C I E F L Hyderabad
And I wish I would be able to do my best 
Yeah
Now I've understood uh much from you I've
 understood your carrer and so on 
But so far I've not informed to you anything about me 
Uhm well you as you know my name is Chandrashekhar 
And actually I belong to the south India Tamil Nadu 
Kanyakumari district 
And presently I'm teaching in st Joseph's College
 Chakama Kohima Nagaland 
Teaching in a college where there is P U degree pre degree 
Then B A also is there 
B A two year plus one year 
B A pass course and B A honours 
 I'm teaching there for all the three year students
And I'm happy with my job 
Uhm salary is okay 
Then the people the students are also well co-operative
Then my wife is also working in the college
So everything is quite okay with me 
Uh if you want to know something more about me you are free to
ask 
Uh when did you get this job 
I got this job in nineteen eighty-six
Nineteen nineteen eighty-six 
And uh when did you finish your post graduate
My post graduation degree I finished it in uh mid June
nineteen eighty-six
June nineteen eighty-six 
 Yes 
And immediately after that in July nineteen eighty-six I joined the
post
Yeah all right
Uh in fact since you're also doing your uh post
graduation certificate in teaching English uh after I hope as you
are doing well and laughs and uh you are supposed to get
good grade as well in the what would be your next step 
Are you going to take up your Diploma course
Or uh if you get suppose if you get uh uh A grade or A plus 
then uh would you like to take up your M Litt
Certainly
Master of Litt
Yeah certainly 
I my ambition is this one to do my Diploma and
complete my M Litt then if possible M Phil also so that I can cover
the literature side also English literature then at last do
my Ph D it's my aim 
But I think things will go on well 
Shall I take your opinion about your 
academic career 
Uh you talk talk about your M Phil and Diploma as well
But I don't think it's my own opinion uh once
you have degree of uh Diploma in the teaching of English from C I E F L
Hyderabad and most of the universities of our country uh have uh
accepted this Diploma equivalent to M Phil degree 
Then I don't think it would better for you to do again 
your M Phil 
And it would be better to do your M Litt after your Diploma
Yeah what you've said is correct
But uh after doing M Phil uh Diploma I directly wanted to
 do my M Litt course 
And then if possible I'll cover up in order to
cover up the literature area also I feel like doing M Phil if possible
Suppose if uh you finish your M Litt I think it's
 your ambition and is a desire as well 
And then uh would you like to think something uh about
your Ph D 
Quite often we find people interested uh in doing Ph D 
Uhm somewhere even some from the from some universities
But uh doing Ph D from C I E F L Hyderabad is not an easy
task 
Because uh we are supposed to perform well there only then
Ph D degree is awarded there
So uh what is your next plan
What about your next plan in future to do your Ph D from C I E F L
Hyderabad or some uh other universities of our country 
It is yet uhm uhm very interesting question that you have
asked me 
Actually it is not an easy task to do our Ph D from C I E 
especially in E L T 
But before that I want to give extra reading to improve
myself 
So that I can when I finish my Diploma M Litt and M Phil
 with wider reading I think I'll be able to uh complete
my Ph D very well in a satisfactory way 
Okay
You have told me all about yourself
Now could you tell me something about your family background
 your parents and how many children are there in the family and so on 
Right I infact my family is cons consist of
 uh six seven members seven members 
Uh my parents and uh my two brothers and uh two
sisters and I've a wife and I've a son as well
Right infact my father is uh at Calcutta he
is in Port Trust as a Cargo Officer there
And uh next year sometime uh in June he is going to
 retire 
And uh as far as uh my question is concerned I'm 
the man uhm yeah 
Are you the eldest in the family 
Yeah no my one of my sister is the youngest
 I'm sorry eldest and uh I'm the next to her 
I see 
What about you
Would you like to uhm give some details about yourself
Why not sure
See in our family we're five children to our
parents 
Three sisters and two brothers including me 
My both the parents are farmers only 
My eldest sister is married to a Police Officer 
He is in Tamil Nadu 
The second sister is married to A N J C O serving in the army
And myself you know a lot about me since we've 
been staying for a long time 
Not long time about two weeks back 
Then my youngest younger brother he is doing his B E now
Then youngest one is doing her B A class B A Economics 
 so 
 What about your wife
Ah I forgot to tell me laughs tell you about my wife
 I'm sorry 
Uhm she is also a Post Graduate in English 
And she is working in the same college 
Along with you
Along with me 
And I've got a son also
Yeah that's the thing
Yeah laughs he is one year old and one year and
two months old 
A very naughty boy 
Naughty boy 
Yeah very clever
He has got after you
Say like this quiet naughty boy cough 
Yeah children are supposed to be naughty at the
beginning
Hope it is 
But he is very clever so everything is well 
And uh I like the family I'm a happy man so to
so to say 
That is the matter uh for you its good that you
have uh a wife and a son 
You must be very happy man having a wife who is
working with you in the same college 
And uh don't you think uh whenever you work in the same
college you find some sort of uh uhm problem 
Problem I mean uh working in a same college in same in
the same de department 
Don't you find uh some sort of trouble or some sort of 
cont or controversy as such
 You see uh 
There is no trouble or problem as such 
But the only problem with us is getting leave from 
the principal 
 That's the only problem 
When she wants to do any course or anything she can't get
leave
And when I want to do anything I also I'm not free to
get leave 
This is the only problem we face when we work together in the
same college and nothing else 
The other things are okay because we're working in
the same place 
And we have the opportunity of being together always and it
is something interesting 
A few days infact I would like to take you to uhm I
would like to take you in this politics 
And uh I think uh you you must be familiar uh with the
conditions going on that our country is facing 
Uhm political disasters and uh disorders and election has
taken place a few weeks earlier 
And uh what shall would be your opinion and that no
party again has come into power
And I think uh uh in your opinion as far as my opinion is
concerned I would like to uh uh I want uh if India needs uh 
British rule or uh next alternative 
What would be the next alternative would you like to suggest 
But uh clearing the throat what has happened
this year is really a political disaster 
But even then I still have faith in democracy 
But all the political systems ha have their own
defects 
Even then I believe in democracy and uh India needs
a better leader 
One who can do and one who can do well for the people
Now we have been talking about everything since you belong to
 since you belong to M P could you tell me something about your state
 It's alright infact I went to Jabalpur 
A well known city of uh M P state 
I went there in nineteen eighty-five 
I uh before uh I had uh no sort of any idea about uh M P
And uh but there I found people particularly in the
field of pol politics 
There politics is based on some sort of principles 
And uh leaders are supposed to do some work concrete work
 uh for the public 
And infact uh same people sometime they favour uh
 Congress-I and sometime they favour 
 Bharatiya Janata Party but they're but
infact there uh politics is based there uh on uh some sort of
principles 
They are not going to show the same beaten track like uh
 other states U P Bihar where politics is totally based on uhm
casteism
