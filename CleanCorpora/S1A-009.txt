<I>
""
""
Uhm  you told something about your native
place 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Which is your native place 
""
""
Native Place is uh 
""
""
Oh I see 
""
So 
""
""
In fact I finished my  from the University
of Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 
""
""
Uhm 
""
That means uh you finished it 
""
Which year 
""
""
Yeah 
""
Right 
""
""
After that 
""
""
Infact after uh  almost uh
 M A degree
""
And uh after that  I taught in a college almost for four year
uh four months 
since it was a private college  from
this college 
""
And meanwhile  in state
government school 
going on with this job 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
 to a certain extent
""
""
But since  Jabalpur
city 
""
So sometimes I don't find 
""
Eh in the in the sense 
appointed there  uh but things are quite
different there
""
I don't find people  with me in
English  uh
I quiet often I used by mother tongue  Hindi
""
So  that
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
 since you do not get the
opportunity to use English outside the classroom  or even inside the
classroom 
""
""
 not uh fully satisfied
""
uh unless uh we  unless
we follow the uhm four available skills 
then I don't think it will be better for a learner  develop or uh
""
""
""
Okay I understand that
""
Now  after going back
 in the classroom itself
""
""
""
Yeah I would like to  as
much as uh 
""
Since uh 
not able to understand uh 
""
But even then I would like to do  particularly
I would like to use  English sentences simple sentences
""
So that uh  understand the
sentences 
""
""
Yeah 
to to begin with you can use simple English  simple sentences
""
And uh 
you can increase the standard 
""
And I think  be successful in using English inside
the classroom also 
""
And when you meet some friends  when you go here and there to
different places  uh you
can improve a lot 
""
Then 
""
That is uh to continue the school or to search for another job 
""
""
Well uhm infact 
particularly in my  particularly
pronunciation  uh
other fields of English  but I
realise that uh I lack something 
""
So my next plan would be  from
C I E F L Hyderabad
""
And 
""
""
Yeah
""
Now  I've
""
""
But so far 
""
Uhm well you as you know my name is Chandrashekhar 
""
And actually I belong to 
Kanyakumari district 
""
And presently  College
""
""
Teaching in a college where there is P U degree 
""
Then B A also is there 
""
B A 
""
B A pass course 
""
 year students
""
""
And 
""
Uhm salary is okay 
""
Then the people  well co-operative
""
""
Then  my wife is also working in the college
""
So everything is quite okay with me 
""
Uh if you want to know something more about me  you are free to
ask 
""
""
Uh when did you 
""
""
I got this job  in nineteen eighty-six
""
""
Nineteen nineteen eighty-six 
""
And uh when did you finish your  post graduate
""
""
My post graduation degree I finished it in  uh mid June
nineteen eighty-six
""
""
June nineteen 
""
""
""
""
And immediately after that in July nineteen eighty-six I joined the
post
""
""
Yeah  all right
""
Uh in fact  uh post
graduation certificate in teaching English  as you
are doing well and  get
good grade 
""
Are you going to take up your Diploma course
""
Or uh if you get suppose if you get 
then  M Litt
""
""
Certainly
""
""
Master of Litt
""
""
Yeah certainly 
""
I my ambition is this one  and
complete my M Litt  so that I can cover
the literature  at last do
my Ph D 
""
But I think 
""
""
Shall I 
academic career 
""
Uh you talk  and Diploma as well
""
""
But I don't think  uh once
you have degree  of uh Diploma in the teaching of English from C I E F L
Hyderabad  uh have uh
accepted this Diploma 
""
Then I don't think 
your M Phil 
""
And it would be better to do  after your Diploma
""
""
""
Yeah  said is correct
""
But  I directly wanted to
""
""
And then if possible  in order to
cover up the literature area also  I feel like doing M Phil if possible
""
""
""
Suppose if  it's
""
""
And then  uh about
your Ph D 
""
Quite often we find people interested uh in doing Ph D 
""
Uhm somewhere even some  from the from some universities
""
But uh doing Ph D from  is not an easy
task 
""
Because uh we are supposed to  only then
Ph D degree  is awarded there
""
So  uh what is your next plan
""
What about your next plan in future to do your Ph D from C I E F L
Hyderabad or some 
""
""
It is yet  uhm uhm very interesting question that you have
asked me 
""
Actually it is not an easy task 
especially in E L T 
""
But  to improve
myself 
""
So that I can  M Litt and M Phil
 uh complete
my Ph D 
""
Okay
""
You have told me all about yourself
""
Now  could you tell me something about your family background
""
""
""
Right  consist of
""
""
Uh my parents  uh two
sisters  a son as well
""
""

""
""
""

""
""
What about you
""
Would you like to  details about yourself
""
""
Why not  sure
""
See in our family  to our
parents 
""
Three sisters and two brothers 
""
My both the parents are 
""
My eldest sister 
""
He is in Tamil Nadu 
""
The second sister is married to  A N J C O serving in the army
""
""
And myself you know 
been staying for a long time 
""
Not long time about two weeks back 
""
Then my youngest younger brother  B E now
""
""
Then youngest one is doing her 
""
""
""
 about your wife
""
""
Ah I forgot to tell me  tell you about my wife
""
""
""
""
Uhm she is also a Post Graduate in English 
""
And she is working in the same college 
""
""
Along with you
""
""
Along with me 
""
And  got a son also
""
""
Yeah  the thing
""
""
Yeah  and one year and
two months old 
""
A very naughty boy 
""
""
Naughty boy 
""
""
Yeah very clever
""
""
He has got after you
""
""
Say like this 
""
""
Yeah children are supposed to be naughty  at the
beginning
""
""
Hope it is 
""
But he is very clever so 
""
And  a happy man so to
so to say 
""
""
That is the matter  its good that you
have 
""
You must be very  who is
working

And uh  uh whenever you work in the same
college you find some sort of uh 
""
Problem I mean  in same in
the same 
""
Don't you find uh some sort of trouble 
cont  as such
""
""
""
""
""
There is no trouble or problem as such 
""
But the only problem with us is 
the principal 
""
""
""
When she wants to do any course or anything  get
leave
""
And when I want to do anything I also  not free to
get leave 
""
This is the only problem we face  when we work together in the
same college 
""
The other things are okay because  working in
the same place 
""
And we have the opportunity of being together always  and it
is something interesting 
""
""
A few days  uhm I
would like to take you 
""
And uh I think uh you  uh with the
conditions going on that our country is facing 
""
Uhm political disasters  and election has
taken place 
""
And uh  no
party again  has come into power
""
And I think  as far as my opinion is
concerned 
British 
""
What would be the next alternative would you like to suggest 
""
""
But uh  what has happened
this year 
""
But even then I still have faith in democracy 
""
But  have their own
defects 
""
Even then  India needs
a better leader 
""
One who can do  one who can do well for the people
""
""
Now we have been talking about everything  since you belong to
 could you tell me something about your state
""
""

""
""
A well known city of uh M P state 
""
I went there in nineteen eighty-five 
""
I uh before  uh M P
""
""
And uh  the
field of 
""
There 
""
And uh leaders are supposed to do  some work concrete work
""
""
And infact  they favour uh
""
 but
infact there  uh on uh some sort of
principles 
""
They are not going to  like uh
 uhm
casteism
