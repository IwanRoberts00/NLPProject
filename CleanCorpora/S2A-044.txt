""
I will take  to brief you
""
""
Many people may not know  under which this
institution was born 
""
I don't want  but some of my friends
for example now  he has been
associated with me indirectly for this school  right from the first day
 he has a soft
corner for the institution 
""
Whenever  goes out of
the way 
""
Now he knows the background  elder people
 they are
knowing the background 
""
In this particular instance we must remember 
revered  who was
the first person  and also blessed us
""
""
And  and
even in his absence 
Vidyasimhacharya  and
he has been blessing us all along 
""
Now we 
blessings 
""
Building an institution  social
work  to humanity
 or
religious aspect 
""
Now this institution  when I migrated to Mulund in nineteen
fifty-seven  there were some
enterprising  Mulund
""
""
They came to me  why not we start
some 
""
I said okay 
""
Any cultural activity 
before  Dharwar Belgaum Bijapur Karwar districts
were  many Kannada speaking people
""
migrated to Bombay  building up
their career commercial activities 
""
They became one  and
they started 
""
Naturally  and the tradition
""
 slightly
""
Though  so far as the thinking is concerned
""
""
But  some
difference take place 
""
So some people said we should maintain our 
though we have migrated from our 
came  and settled down here
""
Now 
""
Of course  here from nineteen
forty-five 
""
""
""
Today  some of the grandchildren or great grandchildren of the
people who came fifty hundred years ago from Karnataka  their children do
not know even kannada language 
""
But that doesn't mean  we are not here on a linguist aspect or
the communal aspect other thing
""
It is only to maintain 
""
Each culture and tradition  has
its own good points  the good
points 
""
Now for example  speaking this language he is
speaking this language I must hate him
""
No not that way 
""
Bombay is a cosmopolitan 
""
Every language every caste every creed 
""
And we are also a part of mini India  though originally we come
from some place  but we have to maintain our culture and tradition
""
We are trying to maintain 
""
For that purpose only I agreed we started 
""
But I used to see  there was only one
Kannada school somewhere in 
that too in 
""
And ultimately  and I used to
see 
railway  all the way from Ambarnath Dombivali
Kalyan and other thing etcetera or Wadala 
""
So I said look  it is
education 
""
With the education 
or  become a
part of Bombay  be benefitted
""
So 
""
Everybody appreciated 
""
Then 
activities 
Vidya Prasaraka Mandala  and in those days we used to call it
Mulund-Thana  there were many people from Mulund many people
from Thana even Dombivali everybody was coming 
""
So  Mulund-Thana that was the name given and we
started 
""
In the initial stages 
they associated with the institution  and some of them were not still
born in the institution 
""
They were born a few years later 
""
Now I can say Kamath or Joshi or uh 
""
They came and joined a little later 
""
Then this institution  increasing the activities
""
""
We didn't have 
""
So the first 
at my premises where I was staying 
""
And there was one teacher  who sacrificed for couple of years
""
you'll 
rupees 
Kannada first standard Kannada second standard 
""
One teacher conducting all the schools 
""
And we had devoted workers  like one Mr Bharbare he was working
in the 
""
And there was another Mr Malagi  had
sufficient time at their disposal being a government servants  not I want
to belittle 
""
But  you have to go
right eight 
""
""
But the government officer he can go at ten  and
come back at five 
""
But they were devoted workers 
""
They used to go door to door where Kannada people are staying 
and request them 
""
That some of the parents were uneducated they were not able to send
""
""
Somehow convincing forcibly they used to bring 
they were these two were  aaya
 who bring the school children to the school and take them back home
""
""
I mean that was the kind of  for the
work they had 
""
And this way the school went on 
""
Then 
thirty thousand 
""
Fortunately or unfortunately  who
developed 
""
Of which  the oldest M B B S doctor
general practitioner  and some of the people we
started the activities 
""
And then  converted them you know now
conversion takes place  to devote something for the
school 
""
During this contact I came across  the managing committee
members chairman president everything etcetera of the Gujrathi schools 
""
So Manilal Chaturbhuj Gandhi  became a very good friend of mine
""
""
Because of my association with these people  and my activities
""
""
I requested him one day  we are small people we don't have
money we don't have funds we don't have workers  can we use can we use
""
""
He said most welcome 
""
Then I asked him we don't have big money to pay the rents also 
""
He said 
""
They didn't ask a single  and then
 and
they also  from that managing committee they looked after us very well
 upto S S C standard
""
""
They used to break the glass 
they don't uh 
""
Then tear the paper and throw it somewhere 
""
Now we were running in the morning shift  hardly there
was half an hour 
between their school and our school  from the
headmaster  of the Gujrathi school started coming this this this this this
""
""
But let me tell you  Manilal and his team
of committee members  they were so cooperative
""
One day they called me  tum ek kam karo
""
""
Tell me what is it  dekho tum ek jhadu wale ko laga do
""
""
Children make mischief and other thing etcetera 
""
So therefore  they will just clean
it and make it good so that I don't have to listen to my own principal to
coming 
""
So 
""
It should have struck  struck the headmaster there at that time
""
""
Our Gudi was there 
""
I forced Gudi to come and join this institution
""
He was not willing to come  today
we all of us look to 
""
Now 
""
Okay what are you going to do  ?
""
So in good old days  ?
""
Close the eye and join 
""
So private company 
""
If it is a private company  oh nobody knows
whether after five years this will remain or not 
""
So those were the days  a
secured job 
""
Mr Gudi had already a secured permanent job  in one of the
leading schools  but somehow I succeeded in brainwashing
him  we may not pay you
what you are getting  but we have a soft corner for you if you come and
sacrifice 
""
Who is at the back of you  ?
""
He even today a bachelor  still there associated with the
school indirectly 
""
Who is at the back of you  ?
""
For whom you want to have a  ?
""
Come join 
""
Do some social work at least 
""
He came 
""
Then 
""
Then we were on the look out for a place 
""
And this Kamath came across the landlord of this place  and uh
we had nobody to pay 
""
This man Mahalay had a very big land 
""
So he was selling piece by piece 
""
We selected 
""
Do you know it took us  five years to make the payment to him
piece by piece piece by piece  two hundred
""
rupees 
""
In those days what was the mode of collection  ?
""
Sorry  at that time
""
""
I was a very small man in those years 
""
I used to go to them 
""
Look  we have started a Kannada
school  government is not
giving us any grant  ?
""
So  okay here
is our fifty 
""
In those days fifty 
nineteen fifty-seven fifty-eight 
""
Hundred 
""
Some people used to ask me 
they asked me point blank question 
""
Are you sending your children to this school  ?
""
I said no my children are going to English medium school
""
There was a Simpson School or something like that 
""
Then why do you want this headache  ?
""
Better go away 
""
Even people insulted me like this 
""
So  any help or
donation will come from  if I go and ask them who do
not have what can they give  ?
""
At the most  they
may give the sympathy 
""
If they are elders they may bless 
""
If they are youngsters  I will go
run about beg borrow 
""
If they are youngsters 
""
So I tried  fortunately for me associated with a chemical
trade in uh Bombay 
""
I started only one aspect 
""
This  most of the Gujrati people were in the chemical trade in
those years 
""
I used to give them  whenever they
came 
""
They had a sympathy for me 
""
So I said let me try to tap the source 
""
So once a year  with a small request
""
""
And in those days  we used to keep hundred
""
""
And hundred 
""
Half page quarter page one eighth page 
and go door to door 
""
Some people say  arey jao tum pachas rupye leke jao
""
""
Even they would not ask for a receipts 
""
I said no you must take the receipt 
""
This money collected in those years  was utilised only for
 plus whatever we were able
to contribute from our pockets 
""
Then I said this way we cannot do it 
""
Bhimsen Joshi being a very good friend of mine  invariably
whenever he was in Bombay he was 
""
Those days also  fifty thousand
""
""
In those days  if you give a good
cup of tea at your house 
""
So  okay for
your school 
""
And what I was in return giving  for some
other programme at their expense 
and we didn't have a big money to purchase the  I mean to hire a big hall
""
""
So we used to request the Poddar college  Principal take that
Poddar College hall  run this small show
""
And to Bhimsen Joshi  rupee ghuch
""
""
He was very happy and convinced  and he gave us couple of
programmes 
""
Then not only that  what
is his name from Benaras 
""
Yeah 
""
He told Bismillah  were studying
together somewhere in North India  of the
 and uh serving
the  therefore they
were good friends 
""
He said 
phokat mei karneka 
""
Of course we paid in those days hundred  or
something like that to  coming from Benaras and all
that
