<I>
I will take exactly ten minutes of yours to brief you
 about our institution 
Many people may not know the background under which this
institution was born 
I don't want to boast about myself but some of my friends
for example now my good friend Mr Leherchand Shah he has been
associated with me indirectly for this school right from the first day
 we decided to start this institution and still he has a soft
corner for the institution 
Whenever I request him to do something he goes out of
the way and does it 
Now he knows the background and some of the elder people
 of the so called founder members of the institution they are
knowing the background of course 
In this particular instance we must remember our late 
revered parampujya Gopalacharya Mouli who was
the first person to inaugurate this institution and also blessed us
And till his last he had his blessings with us and
even in his absence our present parampujya 
Vidyasimhacharya is at the back of the institution invisibly and
he has been blessing us all along 
Now we believe God's grace elder's 
blessings always lead to success of anything 
Building an institution starting your activities social
work commercial activities anything to do good to humanity
 whether it is a medical aspect or any kind of thing or
religious aspect 
Now this institution when I migrated to Mulund in nineteen
fifty-seven beginning or fifty-six end there were some
enterprising Kannada speaking people in Dombivali Thana Mulund
 and uh neighbouring suburbs 
They came to me they just requested me why not we start
some Karnataka Sangha and continue some activities 
I said okay 
Any cultural activity and naturally in those years 
before nineteen fifty-six Dharwar Belgaum Bijapur Karwar districts
were the part of Bombay state and many Kannada speaking people
 in those from these districts they came and 
migrated to Bombay for education for their building up
their career commercial activities came and settled down 
They became one with the masses of the locality and
they started their own activities 
Naturally culture and civilisation and the tradition
 in India differs right from Himalaya up to Ka 
 Kanyakumari slightly
Though we are all one so far as the thinking is concerned
But the traditions in areawise languagewise some
difference take place 
So some people said we should maintain our tradition also 
though we have migrated from our districts and come 
came and settled down here
Now we've become a part of this place 
Of course I should say I'm here from nineteen
forty-five 
 I've seen the generation passing 
Today some of the grandchildren or great grandchildren of the
people who came fifty hundred years ago from Karnataka their children do
not know even kannada language 
But that doesn't mean we are not here on a linguist aspect or
the communal aspect other thing
It is only to maintain the culture and tradition 
Each culture and tradition has its own history has
its own good points and therefore we are only seeing the good
points of the culture and civilization and not the bad points 
Now for example he is uh speaking this language he is
speaking this language I must hate him
No not that way 
Bombay is a cosmopolitan 
Every language every caste every creed it is a mini India 
And we are also a part of mini India though originally we come
from some place but we have to maintain our culture and tradition
We are trying to maintain 
For that purpose only I agreed we started 
But I used to see in those days there was only one
Kannada school somewhere in a corner of Sion and Matunga 
that too in a hutments military barracks running 
And ultimately this was shifted to Wadala and I used to
see young boys seven years eight years going in the 
railway train all the way from Ambarnath Dombivali
Kalyan and other thing etcetera or Wadala cough 
So I said look if at all there is anything it is
education 
With the education we can bring up our people 
or the society which has come and settle down here become a
part of Bombay they will definitely be benefitted
So why not we start uh an education institution 
Everybody appreciated 
Then we more or less decreased the cultural 
activities of the Karnataka Sangha and started the 
Vidya Prasaraka Mandala and in those days we used to call it
Mulund-Thana because there were many people from Mulund many people
from Thana even Dombivali everybody was coming 
So it was Mulund-Thana that was the name given and we
started 
In the initial stages some devoted few workers 
they associated with the institution and some of them were not still
born in the institution 
They were born a few years later 
Now I can say Kamath or Joshi or uh Shastri 
They came and joined a little later 
Then this institution started increasing the activities
We didn't have any place 
So the first one year the institution started working 
at my premises where I was staying in the balcony 
And there was one teacher who sacrificed for couple of years
 one by name Mrs Setlur she was a qualified teacher and 
you'll be surprised I used to pay from my pocket fifteen 
rupees per month to her to conduct the Kannada K G 
Kannada first standard Kannada second standard 
One teacher conducting all the schools 
And we had devoted workers like one Mr Bharbare he was working
in the A G's office now I do not know where he is 
And there was another Mr Malagi these two people had
sufficient time at their disposal being a government servants not I want
to belittle a government servants 
But when you've got your own shop you have to go
right eight O'clock and open it and keep be 
 there whether the customers come or not 
But the government officer he can go at ten O'clock and
come back at five O'clock so long he completes the work 
But they were devoted workers 
They used to go door to door where Kannada people are staying 
and request them please send your child to our school 
That some of the parents were uneducated they were not able to send
Somehow convincing forcibly they used to bring they were 
they were these two were the boys who were todays aaya
 who bring the school children to the school and take them back home
 that kind of activity they have done 
I mean that was the kind of attachment devotions for the
work they had 
And this way the school went on 
Then in Mulund in those days the population was about 
thirty thousand 
Fortunately or unfortunately I had many Kacchi friends who
developed and we started one small social club of Mulund 
Of which our Dr Lalan the first the oldest M B B S doctor
general practitioner Leherchand Shah and some of the people we
started the activities 
And then slowly I rather converted them you know now
conversion takes place converted them to devote something for the
school 
During this contact I came across the managing committee
members chairman president everything etcetera of the Gujrathi schools 
So Manilal Chaturbhuj Gandhi became a very good friend of mine
Because of my association with these people and my activities
 so became a friend 
I requested him one day we are small people we don't have
money we don't have funds we don't have workers can we use can we use
 your school when you are not using without disturbing you 
He said most welcome 
Then I asked him we don't have big money to pay the rents also 
He said who asks you to pay the rent ? 
They didn't ask a single nayapaisa and then
 Manibhai's all the children became our good friends and
they also from that managing committee they looked after us very well
 and sometime you know when our school grew upto S S C standard
 cough the grown up children sometime become mischievous 
They used to break the glass they used to make it dirty 
they don't uh take care of the toilet 
Then tear the paper and throw it somewhere 
Now we were running in the morning shift and hardly there
was half an hour dist difference 
between their school and our school and lot of complaint from the
headmaster of the Gujrathi school started coming this this this this this
But let me tell you my good friend Manilal and his team
of committee members they were so cooperative
One day they called me Arey Kulkarni tum ek kam karo
 
Tell me what is it dekho tum ek jhadu wale ko laga do
 
Children make mischief and other thing etcetera 
So therefore before this school come they will just clean
it and make it good so that I don't have to listen to my own principal to
coming uh I mean uh making complaint against you people 
So this is a good idea 
It should have struck struck the headmaster there at that time
 but he didn't 
Our Gudi was there 
I forced Gudi to come and join this institution
He was not willing to come because two reasons today
we all of us look to security 
Now our children grow 
Okay what are you going to do ?
So in good old days are you getting a government job ?
Close the eye and join because it is secured 
So private company is it a long standing then join 
If it is a private company just started oh nobody knows
whether after five years this will remain or not 
So those were the days when everybody was looking for a
secured job 
Mr Gudi had already a secured permanent job in one of the
leading schools of N K E S but somehow I succeeded in brainwashing
him and I told him we may not have money we may not pay you
what you are getting but we have a soft corner for you if you come and
sacrifice and ultimately I had to cut a joke at him 
Who is at the back of you ?
He even today a bachelor still there associated with the
school indirectly 
Who is at the back of you ?
For whom you want to have a a secure job ?
Come join 
Do some social work at least you'll get a good name 
He came joined 
Then all the youngsters team came and joined 
Then we were on the look out for a place 
And this Kamath came across the landlord of this place and uh
we had nobody to pay 
This man Mahalay had a very big land 
So he was selling piece by piece 
We selected 
Do you know it took us five years to make the payment to him
piece by piece piece by piece hundred rupees two hundred
 rupees thousand rupees two thousand 
rupees because we were to collect and give it 
In those days what was the mode of collection ?
Sorry to say some of our Kannada people at that time
 were in trade in business in industry 
I was a very small man in those years 
I used to go to them 
Look you are from Karnataka we have started a Kannada
school we want to do this we don't have funds government is not
giving us any grant shall we will you help us ?
So some people who had love for education okay here
is our fifty rupees 
In those days fifty rupees was a big amount 
nineteen fifty-seven fifty-eight 
Hundred rupees was a big amount 
Some people used to ask me are you sending your ch 
they asked me point blank question 
Are you sending your children to this school ?
I said no my children are going to English medium school
There was a Simpson School or something like that 
Then why do you want this headache ?
Better go away 
Even people insulted me like this 
So ultimately I came to the conclusion any help or
donation will come from people who have if I go and ask them who do
not have what can they give ?
At the most people who have got a love for education they
may give the sympathy 
If they are elders they may bless 
If they are youngsters okay you ask me run about I will go
run about beg borrow won't steal but I'll get something 
If they are youngsters who has a devotion for education 
So I tried fortunately for me associated with a chemical
trade in uh Bombay 
I started only one aspect 
This most of the Gujrati people were in the chemical trade in
those years and I was associated with the chemical trade 
I used to give them advice guidance whenever they
came 
They had a sympathy for me 
So I said let me try to tap the source 
So once a year I used to go to them with a small request
And in those days for a souvenir we used to keep hundred
 rupees is the highest for advertisement fees 
And hundred rupees very few people will pay 
Half page quarter page one eighth page based on hundred 
and go door to door 
Some people say arey jao tum pachas rupye leke jao
 
Even they would not ask for a receipts 
I said no you must take the receipt 
This money collected in those years was utilised only for
 paying the salary of the teachers plus whatever we were able
to contribute from our pockets 
Then I said this way we cannot do it 
Bhimsen Joshi being a very good friend of mine invariably
whenever he was in Bombay he was camping in my house 
Those days also like today his fees are fifty thousand
 rupees 
In those days he would go and sing if you give a good
cup of tea at your house 
So I used to request him and he said okay for
your school I'll give you a free performance 
And what I was in return giving he would come for some
other programme at their expense and one day give it for our school 
and we didn't have a big money to purchase the I mean to hire a big hall
So we used to request the Poddar college Principal take that
Poddar College hall and run this small show
And to Bhimsen Joshi one and a half rupee ghuch
 that's all was given to him 
He was very happy and convinced and he gave us couple of
programmes 
Then not only that he brought that Ustad uh uhm what
is his name from Benaras Shehenaiwallah 
Yeah Bismillah Khan 
He told Bismillah because Bismillah and he were studying
together somewhere in North India sleeping on the footpath of the
 Guru's house both of them and uh serving
the Guru in Northern India and therefore they
were good friends 
He said dekho ye hamara shaala hai uske liye tum 
phokat mei karneka 
Of course we paid in those days hundred rupees or
something like that to meet his expenses coming from Benaras and all
that and that is how begging borrowing we started
