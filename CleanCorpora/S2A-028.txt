Doctor Agarwal and my  and professor Pandya and my friends
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Earlier I was in uh  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
create something new  begin
""
""
And if you do it you will simply improve upon it you cannot 
""
""
Well I do not know how to start afresh because wherever I have gone
""
started afresh  a new
""
""
have got doctorate 
""
""
my university  to run here and there
""
""
Whatever I got I wanted to make it better  most suitable for me
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
work two three places  resource person and a
""
""
""
of states and very intelligent people we are 
""
""
""
life and thinking process is just mechanical  whereas our thinking
process is radical 
""
That is why we think very high  but when we achieve little we
""
think high and get little bit less you get frustrated nothing else 
""
""
""
And I am very sure and very  that India will emerge
""
thousand 
""
""
thing to say  it
""
well as for individuals 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
person in our country ever born 
""
""
""
Now this is all regarding that  business
""
tolerate others 
""
""
particular question or  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The  India which was existing in Vedic period is
""
""
The India of Medieval ages have also gone 
""
And India born in nineteen forty-seven is the real deadline 
""
nation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
like that 
""
""
""
""
""
And accordingly this committee has been set up  to scrutinize
""
some anamolies  avoiding those
""
""
""
want the original question papers  which you will be scrutinizing so we
will be dispatching this whole bunch 
""
So that 
""
India remains as a secular India 
""
And uh  nobody should have any sort of grievance that this was
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
atrocities on women  folk and bias also
""
I remember one instance in a  that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Of course we should do away with that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You may be again invited another team may come  to do further uh
""
""
""
""
laughter 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Wherever there is a society of human beings  some people you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the people  that this it
should not be feeling should not be hurt 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if you work very hard to achieve your goal you will find that
""
""
I feel that at the fag end of my career  say only five or six
""
this 
""
""
 very difficult
""
""
When I see the plight of our young people  when I see the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So my pound of wisdom is almost going to dry 
""
To keep myself fresh I still  continue
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
When I make a comparison  last week on Wednesday I was
""
department  and directors
""
""
I said  between the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If we invite fifty teachers from Gujarat five come 
""
Fifty-five are forty-five are absent 
""
""
doing tuitions 
""
So 
""
""
""
""
He will be visiting us very shortly  to find out the problems
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
classroom 
""
""
like other states 
""
It is such a language  by
even order 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
And more you get  more you will be in
""
""
""
""
""
And for that 
""
""
You know we are all using our faculty upto cognitive domain only
""
""
And there only upto  that
is knowledge 
""
""
understanding 
""
We have done away with understanding part 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
inculcate 
""
Your job 
""
""
it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which may not be to your taste I am sure 
""
But still  we have to do with them
""
Thank you very much
