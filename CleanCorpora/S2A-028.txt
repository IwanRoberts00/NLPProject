Doctor Agarwal and my  and professor Pandya and my friends
 whatever doctor
Agarwal has said it is exaggerating it 
""
I do not have those qualifications which he has narrated just now
""
""
Only thing is that uh  throughout a teacher
""
""
Earlier I was in uh  a
foundation for new education society 
Foundation 
""
And uh then I  in fact I had no intention to
become a teacher but after hearing several lectures of doctor Krishnamurthy
 brought a change in my
attitudes in life 
""
I have not become disciple of anybody so far  but most of these
philosophers 
""
And I remember Krishnamurthy  as saying that when you want to
create something new  begin
with the middle 
""
And if you do it you will simply improve upon it you cannot 
create something new 
""
Well I do not know how to start afresh because wherever I have gone
I had  my studies I have
started afresh  a new
discipline in the Botany 
discipline of micro- ecology in which some  twenty-five research scholars
have got doctorate 
""
Straight away I joined this college  uh uh soon after passing
my university  to run here and there
""
""
Whatever I got I wanted to make it better  most suitable for me
""
""
And here the people are so  that they
moulded me into a science educationist  and
then a science educationist and then environmentologist  and then
ecologist  ist were added to my name and then ultimately I
became  out of science school science activity
 to
work two three places  resource person and a
Canadian resource person 
""
So the credit goes to our my great country  which has a variety
of states and very intelligent people we are 
""
I can tell you  because I have seen many people and I have
studied in United States of America also and I find  that their entire
life and thinking process is just mechanical  whereas our thinking
process is radical 
""
That is why we think very high  but when we achieve little we
get frustrated  just because when you
think high and get little bit less you get frustrated nothing else 
""
We are no way inferior to any nation 
""
And I am very sure and very  that India will emerge
 uh by the year two
thousand 
""
And uh  I have only one
thing to say  it
will have to show the greatness  is required for a nation as
well as for individuals 
""
And the greatness in Indian philosophy is  dhairya
""
""
You have to listen to others with great patience  tolerate his
views 
""
 you are
coming from  I think bravest
person in our country ever born 
""
And of course patriotism is there 
""
Now this is all regarding that  business
""
tolerate others 
""
There may be hundred and thousand views about presenting a
particular question or  a
particular question a 
""
Say for example when somebody asks me what is the culture of India
 ?
""
Which they said 
""
From which period we should count the history of India  from
Vedic period  or post
Independence period  ?
""
The  India which was existing in Vedic period is
no more that India existing 
""
The India of Medieval ages have also gone 
""
And India born in nineteen forty-seven is the real deadline 
from which we should think ahead  and think about building a strong
nation
""
Whatever is there it is 
in fact that much part of India was made free  and made available to us
""
""
The government of India is uh  very much worried about certain
aspects of national integration 
""
And also atrocities on  uh either in the written form
or verbal or gestural or what sort 
""
Say for example  a particualr religion
""
""
Now why should we do it  ?
""
If  my words are hurting somebody we should
avoid speaking those words avoid writing those words avoid seeking questions
like that 
""
So if  secular infrastructure
of this country  variety
of people 
""
And accordingly this committee has been set up  to scrutinize
 to see if there are
some anamolies  avoiding those
anamolies 
""
Recently we received a letter from the council  they they also
want the original question papers  which you will be scrutinizing so we
will be dispatching this whole bunch 
""
So that 
""
India remains as a secular India 
""
And uh  nobody should have any sort of grievance that this was
done therefore this has 
""
So  this step
is essential 
""
We have  analysed the
textbooks of various languages and various states  on several aspects
like uh 
atrocities on women  folk and bias also
""
I remember one instance in a  that
Ram asked Sita  bucketful of water from the well
""
""
The objection was raised  why Seeta should go to fetch water
""
""
Uh the male dominance is not liked 
""
Of course we should do away with that 
""
Too much dominance of female is also not good 
""
It happens in our homes 
""
So 
laughter 
happier 
""
So  all sorts of things are there and there is no end to it also
""
Don't think that this will be the final 
""
You may be again invited another team may come  to do further uh
""
""
Because if somebody wants to be hurt 
read your text he may just simply see your face and get hurt 
laughter 
""
What we see that  uh some people say that I am allergic to that
gentleman whenever I see him  I get annoyed
""
""
""
That is what happens in the college also 
""
Wherever there is a society of human beings  some people you
will always find annoyed  no reason behind
it but simply they are annoyed 
""
And you can't do anything 
""
Similarly here also you see only that  the religious questions
and the questions regarding to a particular religion are not there  and if
they are there how they can be moulded  uh views of
the people  that this it
should not be feeling should not be hurt 
""
Now as a teacher I find that our role is the most difficult role
which the society has given to us 
""
We have made it easier 
telling whatever little you know  to the students and then thinking that
your job is over 
""
But if you work very hard to achieve your goal you will find that
your life span is very little 
""
I feel that at the fag end of my career  say only five or six
years are left  I feel that I have been able to achieve very little in
this 
""
And I wish that I  to see
 very difficult
""
""
When I see the plight of our young people  when I see the
unemployment 
and uhn 
""
And in this college also 
""
Routine duties are so heavy  that you cannot just do the other
things 
""
So my pound of wisdom is almost going to dry 
""
To keep myself fresh I still  continue
 that compels me to learn
""
""
Otherwise  this college or any other college they are all true
reflection of whatever society we have 
""
Now when anything goes wrong the teachers are caught and blamed
""
""
So as a community  especially there is
nothing to warn to people of Maharashtra and Goa 
in our region 
""
When I make a comparison  last week on Wednesday I was
at Ahmedabad  education
department  and directors
of education and boards and all these people sitting 
""
I said  between the
different 
Goa  because the people are there
sincere they want to work 
""
And then comes  and Gujarat is the last
state 
""
And you must take care of this thing why Gujarat is  lagging
behind  ?
""
Why your teachers are not coming forward  ?
""
If we invite fifty teachers from Gujarat five come 
""
Fifty-five are forty-five are absent 
""
Then one of them remarked  that it is because they are all
doing tuitions 
""
So 
""
And this is this condition so they said that  I will send
""
""
He will be visiting us very shortly  to find out the problems
of Gujarati students 
""
That how is it  they do not
know any language other than Gujarati 
""
They don't neither follow English  and we don't
know 
""
So how can we communicate with them  so they are sitting in the
classroom 
""
So I said  in Gujarat state also
like other states 
""
It is such a language  by
even order 
""
Hindi will replace English in some hundred years 
""
It is not a matter of 
""
So he is coming to study the whole thing and then he will make a
report 
""
So 
""
And more you get  more you will be in
trouble 
""
But  not just an orator of
your subject 
""
And for that 
your 
""
You know we are all using our faculty upto cognitive domain only
""
""
And there only upto  that
is knowledge 
""
And in knowledge  when knowledge enters you develop
understanding 
""
We have done away with understanding part 
""
And when you achieve understanding  then you develop
application of knowledge 
""
That is why Indians are more philosophical  more
skilled people 
""
So these things we have to 
inculcate 
""
Your job 
""
And I think such a galaxy of stars  will be able to complete
it 
""
And I will request doctor Agarwal  the moment you complete your
work 
""
""
So I have to attend another meeting at four  so I take leave
from you people thanking you very much 
over here 
which may not be to your taste I am sure 
""
But still  we have to do with them
""
Thank you very much
