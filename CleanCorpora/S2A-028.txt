<I>
Doctor Agarwal and my and professor Pandya and my friends
 it is my previlege to be with you and uh whatever doctor
Agarwal has said it is exaggerating it uh form or thing 
I do not have those qualifications which he has narrated just now
Only thing is that uh I have been throughout a teacher
 and a very long career of a teacher 
Earlier I was in uh Rajghat Baseti school a
foundation for new education society run by doctor J Krishnamurthy 
Foundation 
And uh then I heard him in fact I had no intention to
become a teacher but after hearing several lectures of doctor Krishnamurthy
 which was which had changed brought a change in my
attitudes in life 
I have not become disciple of anybody so far but most of these
philosophers had been uh having some or the other impact on me 
And I remember Krishnamurthy as saying that when you want to
create something new you have to start afresh you can't uh begin
with the middle 
And if you do it you will simply improve upon it you cannot 
create something new 
Well I do not know how to start afresh because wherever I have gone
I had got an established institution of course my studies I have
started afresh and of course there I have been able to create a new
discipline in the Botany department of Banaras Hindu University 
discipline of micro- ecology in which some twenty-five research scholars
have got doctorate and a couple of them are registered 
Straight away I joined this college uh uh soon after passing
my university and uh I am not that smart to run here and there
 for a better job 
Whatever I got I wanted to make it better most suitable for me
And here the people are so wise and intelligent that they
moulded me into a science educationist and being a botanist and
then a science educationist and then environmentologist and then
ecologist and so many ist were added to my name and then ultimately I
became a expert in uh out of science school science activity
 and UNESCO accepted me as expert and resource person and sent me to
work two three places along with an Australian resource person and a
Canadian resource person 
So the credit goes to our my great country which has a variety
of states and very intelligent people we are 
I can tell you because I have seen many people and I have
studied in United States of America also and I find that their entire
life and thinking process is just mechanical whereas our thinking
process is radical and rather more philosophical 
That is why we think very high but when we achieve little we
get frustrated unnecessarily because this is just because when you
think high and get little bit less you get frustrated nothing else 
We are no way inferior to any nation in the world 
And I am very sure and very hopeful that India will emerge
 as one of the strongest and well built nation uh by the year two
thousand is over 
And uh regarding this particular programme I have only one
thing to say that if India has to sustain as a great nation it
will have to show the greatness which is required for a nation as
well as for individuals 
And the greatness in Indian philosophy is dhairya
 that is patience 
You have to listen to others with great patience tolerate his
views vidya education another aspect 
 Dhairya vidya and then bravery you are
coming from Shivaji's place who was the I think bravest
person in our country ever born 
And of course patriotism is there 
Now this is all regarding that dhairya business
 whatever we are going to do because tolerance comes when you 
tolerate others 
There may be hundred and thousand views about presenting a
particular question or pasen presenting a
particular question a subject in the text 
Say for example when somebody asks me what is the culture of India
 ?
Which they said they say sanskriti 
From which period we should count the history of India from
Vedic period Aryan period or the Medieval period or post
Independence period ?
The that India which was existing in Vedic period is
no more that India existing 
The India of Medieval ages have also gone 
And India born in nineteen forty-seven is the real deadline 
from which we should think ahead and think about building a strong
nation
Whatever is there it is we cannot call it partition India 
in fact that much part of India was made free and made available to us
 to live in and to work 
The government of India is uh very much worried about certain
aspects of national integration 
And also atrocities on women uh either in the written form
or verbal or gestural or what sort what may be the gists 
Say for example if somebody quotes a particualr religion
 or a text of a religion others get hurt 
Now why should we do it ?
If he is if if my words are hurting somebody we should
avoid speaking those words avoid writing those words avoid seeking questions
like that 
So if if you want to maintain this secular infrastructure
of this country we have to be very cautious in dealing with variety
of people 
And accordingly this committee has been set up to scrutinize
 the question papers of Maharashtra and Gujarat to see if there are
some anamolies and also to suggest methods of avoiding those
anamolies 
Recently we received a letter from the council they they also
want the original question papers which you will be scrutinizing so we
will be dispatching this whole bunch to the headquarters also 
So that India remains as India 
India remains as a secular India 
And uh nobody should have any sort of grievance that this was
done therefore this has been this has happened 
So to build up a real strong national character this step
is essential 
We have al already analysed the
textbooks of various languages and various states on several aspects
like uh bias uh religious bias or political bias or the 
atrocities on women folk and bias also
I remember one instance in a textbook it was cited that
Ram asked Sita to go and fetch a bucketful of water from the well
The objection was raised why Seeta should go to fetch water
 why not Ram should go laughter 
Uh the male dominance is not liked 
Of course we should do away with that 
Too much dominance of female is also not good 
It happens in our homes laughter 
So we do away with that and you do away with this 
laughter to make our li life 
happier 
So all sorts of things are there and there is no end to it also
Don't think that this will be the final 
You may be again invited another team may come to do further uh
 screening of the question paper 
Because if somebody wants to be hurt he need not even 
read your text he may just simply see your face and get hurt 
laughter 
What we see that uh some people say that I am allergic to that
gentleman whenever I see him laughter I get annoyed
 It's alright you have every right to be annoyed 
That is what happens in the college also 
Wherever there is a society of human beings some people you
will always find annoyed annoyed unnecessarily no reason behind
it but simply they are annoyed that's all 
And you can't do anything 
Similarly here also you see only that the religious questions
and the questions regarding to a particular religion are not there and if
they are there how they can be moulded to keep the uh views of
the people in their desirable limit or you can say that this it
should not be feeling should not be hurt 
Now as a teacher I find that our role is the most difficult role
which the society has given to us 
We have made it easier by simply visiting the class and 
telling whatever little you know to the students and then thinking that
your job is over 
But if you work very hard to achieve your goal you will find that
your life span is very little 
I feel that at the fag end of my career say only five or six
years are left I feel that I have been able to achieve very little in
this and a lot of things are to be done 
And I wish that I live for another hundred years to see
 a real good teacher being produced it's very difficult
When I see the plight of our young people when I see the
unemployment when I see the students struggling here for nothing 
and uhn others other such cases also I intend 
And in this college also I am only doing my routine duty 
Routine duties are so heavy that you cannot just do the other
things 
So my pound of wisdom is almost going to dry 
To keep myself fresh I still continuing continue
 taking a couple of classes so that that compels me to learn
 and to go to the class 
Otherwise this college or any other college they are all true
reflection of whatever society we have 
Now when anything goes wrong the teachers are caught and blamed
So as a community I am warning you especially there is
nothing to warn to people of Maharashtra and Goa they are wonderful 
in our region 
When I make a comparison only last week on Wednesday I was
at Ahmedabad uh talking to the chief executives of education
department with chief secretary and education secretary and directors
of education and boards and all these people sitting 
I said If you ask me to compare between the
different between different states of the region I will say 
Goa and Maharashtra are the best because the people are there
sincere they want to work they want to work hard 
And then comes Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat is the last
state 
And you must take care of this thing why Gujarat is lagging
behind ?
Why your teachers are not coming forward ?
If we invite fifty teachers from Gujarat five come 
Fifty-five are forty-five are absent without reason 
Then one of them remarked that it is because they are all
doing tuitions 
So that is you to that is you to go into it 
And this is this condition so they said that I will send
 one person top officer at Regional College of Education Bhopal 
He will be visiting us very shortly to find out the problems
of Gujarati students students of Gujarat state 
That how is it there problems are genuine they do not
know any language other than Gujarati 
They don't neither follow English nor Hindi and we don't
know Gujarati at all 
So how can we communicate with them so they are sitting in the
classroom with open mouth and blank faces 
So I said You introduce English in Gujarat state also
like other states because English is going to stay in our country 
It is such a language which cannot simply be thrown out by
even order 
Hindi will replace English in some hundred years 
It is not a matter of say a decade or two 
So he is coming to study the whole thing and then he will make a
report and submit it to the Gujarat government 
So teachers' job is a very difficult job I tell you 
And more you get bobbed down into it more you will be in
trouble 
But you should be a real teacher not just an orator of
your subject 
And for that you have to have a very deep understanding 
your of your subject 
You know we are all using our faculty upto cognitive domain only
And there only upto recall and memory type of thing that
is knowledge 
And in knowledge when knowledge enters you develop
understanding 
We have done away with understanding part 
And when you achieve understanding then you develop
application of knowledge and skill 
That is why Indians are more philosophical than more
skilled people 
So these things we have to inculcul 
inculcate among the students 
Your job is very simple one 
And I think such a galaxy of stars will be able to complete
it within a day or two or three not more than that 
And I will request doctor Agarwal the moment you complete your
work you may be free to go to your places because we want uh 
 we want only a report on the analysis of question paper 
So I have to attend another meeting at four so I take leave
from you people thanking you very much to have come to come 
over here and to do this particular type of job which not 
which may not be to your taste I am sure 
But still we have to do with them
Thank you very much clapping
