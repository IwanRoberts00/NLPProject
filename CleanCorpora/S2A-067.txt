Yes next para
Mr uh Nanya appearing for the accused 
has canvassed before this court that uh disposed that uh the accused
is charged for the offence under section three nought two I P C 
Fullstop 
He has canvassed three points before this full uh 
before this court for uh consideration 
They are as follows 
Point number one is whether this is a homicidal death second
 whether that uh homicidal death was uh caused by the stabbing
 the deceased by the accused and third if if it is so 
what is the offence 
Full stop 
Next para 
The learned special P P has uh canvassed before this court
 prosecution has laid evidence of P W number one to seven and the
documentary evidence to that effect in order to prove the
point number one the learned uh special P P has invited the
attention of this court to the evidence of Doctor Jaswant 
Tampure and P M notes ex at exhibit fifteen 
According to the learned special P P the death was caused by
uh haemorrhage and shock 
Therefore it was unnatural 
He has also invited the attention of this court to the 
postmortem notes and the opinion of the opinion express by
Doctor Jaswant uh Tanpure 
He has also canvassed before this court that one injury over the uh
 person of the deceased which which can also be prove fatal 
according to Doctor Tanpure 
In the instance case the injury sustained by the deceased 
was perforated uh was uh eh has perforated the wall of the 
abdomen 
That is the reason why there was uh Haematoma on both the
kidneys because of the impact and force used in assaulting the deceased
by the knife by the accused 
Full stop 
The injury was uh caused by a Rampuri 
knife
Full stop
 Rampuri knife is not used for uh suicide by a
person 
A person committing suicide can commit suicide in the 
house or uh at uh secluded place but not on the road 
at uh ten pm 
Therefore suicide eh uh suicide in this case if 
canvassed by the defence is ruled out in all possibilities and
probabilities looking to the uh nature of the injuries nature
of the injury sustained by the accused 
Full stop 
Even on fall uh falling on the ss some sharp
cut shovel uh object is also ruled out to cause uh accidental death
Therefore all the probabilities and possibilities regarding of
 injury by accidental and uh uh by accidental death is
also ruled out 
He has also canvass before this court that the defence 
has not uh suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses in that respect
that the deceased fell uh deceased met with an accident 
In fact the learned sp special 
P P has canvassed before this court that the defence of the accused is
shifting the liability of this injury and the death of the
deceased to P W number one two and three 
Therefore the learned special P P has canvassed before this court
that there is there uh there is and in all probabilities the
deceased met with the homicidal death 
Next para 
He has further canvased in order to elaborate and uh
 placed his reliance on uh second point is that that it is
not the accused but it is P W number one two and three jointly killed 
the deceased 
Full stop 
In this respect the evidence of P W number one two and three is
on the record 
They support each other 
They say that the deceased and the accused are known to P W
number one two and three as there are uh from the same locality 
Therefore there cannot be mistaken identity 
Provocation in fact was given by the accused to the deceased by
saying caw caw 
Full stop 
Also in this case cannot be make available to the accused
 because he gave provocation to the deceased 
It was not a sudden sudden quarrel 
Two parties at the outset were also separated by P W
number one uh P W number one alone and uh and the same have cooled
down as the accused thereafter went to his house and brought uh uh
 Rampuri knife article one from his house 
He has also canvassed before this court that the offence
 in this case was premeditated for the reason that the accused
brought a knife caught hold o caught hold uh caught hold
of the deceased by his uh one hand and pressed the neck of the
accused and stabbed the deceased in his abdomen 
He has also canvassed before before this court that there is no
time to connect the uh sto uh to concoct the story 
because P W numbers uh two and three came on the scene of offence
after hearing the shouts after hearing the shouts caught hold uh
 the hand of the accused in which knife was there and ask P W number
three to call police 
Sufficient light was there at the scene of offence of the
electric lampost of the municipal corporation uh on the road and
from the shops in the surr uh in the surrounding vicinity
Full stop 
There is no animosity between the accused uh and P W
numbers one two three 
There is no substitution of knife 
P W number uh four in this case is examined for uh taking
charge of knife and P W number uh five for taking charge of article
numbers article numbers one and uh two shirt and lungi
 
The lear next para
The learned special P P has also canvassed before this court that
the the blood group of the deceased could not be proved as
uh C A could not uh give the conclusive uh conclusive evidence 
and uh the same the blood uh the blood file which was sent to
the chemical analyser of which the result shows inconclusive 
The blood group of the accused appears to be of O group 
It also appears on articles one two and three cough
 the same blood of group O was also found on the above said uh 
articles 
The blood found on articles one two and three and article five
 is also uh is also the same 
If the blood of uh the blood group of O was also found article five
 then it fixes the liability of the accused that the accused had
 accused and the accused has only committed the offence in the
instance case 
Therefore the learned uh special P P has canvassed before this
court that the intention of the accused was uh to assualt the
deceased 
Hence the learned speical P P states that he was uh he
has proved the case against the accused and he may be convicted 
The learned defence counsel Shri 
Chari appearing uh for the accused has canvassed before this
court that that the blood group of accused is admittedly of O group
She has uh C A has also opined that exhibit numbers one
two three and five were having blood uh of blood group O 
In this case the uh uh accused assaulted the deceased
 with article uh three knife 
The knife article three is having blood group of O 
Uh O category that is of the accused 
The learned uh defence counsel then raised a query before this
court and then uh and has canvassed before this court that in that
case how is that that the blood of O group can be detected on
article uh three 
Because according to P W number uh P W number one two and
three accused assaulted the deceased by article three and that the
knife had uh uh on its blade 
Full stop
Admittedly that blood on the knife can also of the deceased of
O group 
Full stop
It is possible that the deceased can have also the blood group
 O 
But iron of the blood sent to the C A for blood grouping of
the deceased was analysed and the C A in his uh in this respect 
uh in his report exhibit sixteen opined that the blood group of 
uh exhibit uh one cannot be determined as the result results are
inconclusive 
He therefore uh doesn't say that the deceased was also
having O group 
But he says that the blood group of exhibit one cannot be
determined as the results are inconclusive 
Next para
Then uh next question arises for the consideration 
according to the learned defence counsel is that as to how the blood of
the accused appeared on article three and five who was not assaulted
by the deceased 
No witness is saying that the deceased had uh also uh
 also assaulted the accused 
Full stop 
According to Mr More therefore states that the
accused is falsely implicated in this case and that he may be 
acquitted 
I have considered the arguments canvassed from both
the sides 
While considering the points raised by the learned by the
learned uh special P P that whether this is a homicide
death 
Full stop 
Looking to the evidence of P W number uh P W number six
 Dr Jaswant Tanpure and P M notes exhibit fifteen and
the evidence of P W numbers one two and three is prima facie appears
to be a homicidal death 
It can be seen that from the P M notes exhibit uh
exhibit fifteen it appears that there is only one wound one injury
 on the person of the deceased that is incised wound over 
right apochondrial region
