Mr uh 
has canvassed before this court that uh  uh the accused
is charged for the offence under section three nought two I P C 
""
""
Fullstop 
""
""
He has canvassed 
before this court for uh 
""
They are as follows 
""
Point number one is whether this is a homicidal death  second
 stabbing
""
what is the offence 
""
""
Full stop 
""
Next para 
""
""
The learned special P P has  uh canvassed before this court
 and the
documentary evidence  the
point number one  has invited the
attention of this court to the evidence of Doctor 
Tampure 
""
According to the learned special P P  the death was caused by
uh 
""
Therefore it was unnatural 
""
He has also invited the attention of this court to the 
postmortem notes  the opinion express by
Doctor 
""
He has also canvassed before this court that one injury over the uh
""
according to Doctor 
""
In the instance case 
was perforated 
abdomen 
""
That is the reason why there was uh  Haematoma on both the
kidneys  because of the impact and force used in assaulting the deceased
by the knife 
""
Full stop 
""
The injury was uh caused 
knife
""
Full stop
""
 suicide by a
person 
""
A person committing suicide can commit suicide 
house or uh 
at uh 
""
Therefore suicide eh uh suicide 
canvassed by the defence is ruled out  possibilities and
probabilities  nature
of the injury sustained 
""
Full stop 
""
Even on  some sharp
cut shovel uh object  to cause uh accidental death
""
""
Therefore  all the probabilities and possibilities regarding of
 is
also ruled out 
""
He has also 
has not uh suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses  in that respect
that 
""
In fact the learned 
P P has canvassed before this court  that the defence of the accused is
shifting the liability  and the death of the
deceased 
""
Therefore the learned special P P has canvassed before this court
that there is  and in all probabilities the
deceased met with 
""
""
Next para 
""
""
He has  and uh
 it is
not 
the deceased 
""
Full stop 
""
In this respect the evidence of P W number one two and three  is
on the record 
""
They support each other 
""
They say that the deceased and the accused are known to  P W
number one two 
""
Therefore there cannot be 
""
Provocation in fact was  given by the accused to the deceased by
saying 
""
Full stop 
""
Also in this case  make available to the accused
""
""
It was not a sudden sudden quarrel 
""
Two parties  separated by P W
number one  and the same have cooled
down as the accused  uh uh
""
""
He has also  offence
 for the reason that the accused
brought a knife  caught hold
of  and pressed the neck of the
accused and stabbed the deceased in his abdomen 
""
He has also canvassed before before this court that there is no
time 
because P W numbers uh  came on the scene of offence
after hearing the shouts  caught hold uh
 and ask P W number
three 
""
Sufficient light was there at the scene of offence  of the
electric lampost  and
from the shops  in the surrounding vicinity
""
""
Full stop 
""
There is no  and P W
numbers one two three 
""
There is no 
""
P W number uh four  taking
charge of knife  five for taking charge of article
numbers  lungi
""
""
The  next para
""
The learned special P P has also canvassed before this court that
the  as
uh 
and uh  to
the chemical analyser 
""
The blood group of the accused appears to be 
""
It also appears on articles  cough
""
articles 
""
The blood found on articles one two and three  and article five
""
""
If the blood of uh the blood group of O was also found article five
 that the accused had
 the offence in the
instance case 
""
Therefore the learned uh  special P P has canvassed before this
court that the intention of the accused  to assualt the
deceased 
""
Hence  he
has proved the case against the accused 
""
The learned defence counsel 
Chari  has canvassed before this
court that  admittedly of O group
""
""
She has uh  numbers one
two 
""
In this case the uh  accused assaulted the deceased
""
""
The knife article three is having blood group of O 
""
Uh 
""
The learned uh  defence counsel then raised a query before this
court  in that
case how  detected on
article uh 
""
Because according to P W number uh  P W number one two and
three  and that the
knife had uh 
""
Full stop
""
Admittedly that blood on the knife can also  of the deceased of
O group 
""
Full stop
""
It is possible that the deceased can have  also the blood group
""
""
But iron of the blood sent to the C A for blood grouping  of
the deceased was analysed 
uh in his report 
uh exhibit uh one  results are
inconclusive 
""
He therefore uh  deceased was also
having O group 
""
But he says that  the blood group of exhibit one cannot be
determined as the results are inconclusive 
""
Next para
""
Then uh 
according to the learned defence counsel is that  as to how the blood of
the accused  who was not assaulted
by the deceased 
""
No  that the deceased had uh also uh
""
""
Full stop 
""
According to Mr  states that the
accused is falsely implicated in this case 
acquitted 
""
I have considered  from both
the sides 
""
While considering the points raised  by the
learned uh  this is a homicide
death 
""
Full stop 
""
Looking to the evidence  P W number six
 and
the  is prima facie appears
to be 
""
It can be seen  uh
exhibit fifteen it appears that there is only  one injury
""
right
