<I>
 It's a good morning to you all 
Uh in fact you see my aim is to give you as much
information about Indian English as possible during these two lectures
 It's uh there has been a lot there has been a lot of
work in fact you see done in order to establish Indian
English as uh a standard variety of uh British English 
So uh I will give you means in fact you see I'm 
just giving you information about whatever has uh gone in for 
the establishment of the identity of Indian English 
So most of you know that uh the term Indian
English is used to describe English as used by 
the Indians 
Uh there have been several attempts to establish the identity of
Indian English through investigations into its major distinctive features
Uh the seminar on Indian English held at uh C I E F L 
Hyderabad in nineteen hundred seventy-two may be described as the first
collective effort to arrive at some definite conclusions regarding
 the status of Indian English 
Now the conclusion arrived at were Indian English is
not a substandard English it is not pidgin English it is not
just British English with a few Indian spices added to it it has its
own distinct identity 
So these were the conclusions uh at which the seminar 
on Indian English held at uh Hyderabad arrived
you see 
So uh Ramesh Mohan later on edited the paper published
 the the papers I'm sorry the papers which were presented at
the seminar uh with the title Indian writing in English
 
Now as the title of the book suggests the emphasis was on
Indian writing in English only four papers attempted to describe
 the lexical phonological and syntactic features of Indian English
And one of the papers was by Kachru one of the papers was
by Kachru 
Now you must be knowing you see during the colonial days 
Englishmen considered Indian English as a substandard variety of British
English 
Uh now for instance you see certain uh derogatory terms were
used to describe Indian English terms like babu English butler
English 
Now you get reference to these terms in Yule and 
Bernell's Hobsan and Johnson uh Hobsan and Jobson I'm
 sorry Hobson Hobson Jobson it is Hobson Jobson uh which was
published in Eighteen hundred eighty-six 
Uh now Indian English was also described as kitchen English 
and Arey Bhai slof by P Lal in his article on uh
 Indian writing in English which was published in Harward educational
review uses these two terms kitchen English and Arey Bhai
slof 
So uh so the means uh during the early days Indian
English was not acceptable to the British people and uh probably the
Indians even did not think of Indian English as uh having its own
distinct identity 
But uh the sustained efforts made over years by Indian
English linguists critics creative writers and teachers of English
have now established Indian English as a standard variety of English
Now I would uh uh comment on you see Indian English as a non-
native variety of English 
Now some researchers or investigators would accept Indian
English as a non-native variety of English whereas some uh researchers
 would not accept some researchers like Daswani he would not accept
 Indian English as a non-native variety of English 
Uh now it was Prator who first talked of uh Indian
English this I have provided you with uh select bibliography and uh
there are references to some of the articles to which I'm
 going to refe to which I'm going to refer in my 
lecture you see 
So Prator uh dismissed Indian English as a local 
unintelligible model of English 
So he said this is a local model unintelligible and uh 
uh he objected to the setting up of the local variety of English
instead of R P as a model for the learners 
So he insisted that R P should be the model for the learners 
and there should not be uh any attempt to present the local
variety of English 
Now uh Prator in fact called it the heretical tenet 
He said it was uh it is the he said you see it was the
heretical tenet that the local model should be given uh for the
learning of the pronunciation 
Now uh you probably might be knowing you see it was Bansal who
insisted that there should be a local model a local model for 
the teaching of pronunciation 
Uh so far uh there have been some attempts you see but so far
 we have not been able to come to a local model
Probably it would be possible in future when uh the I C E
project will come out 
I C E project that is the international corpus of English project
 which is now being carried out you see
And the for the first time you would be uh for the first time
you see the spoken aspect of Indian English is taken into consideration
So later on it's quite possible the possible that the
local model of spoken English would be uh presented 
So Prator uh seems to have ignored the basic principle
regarding intelligibility which when he calls Indian English as uh
unintelligible he seems to have ignored the basic principle now 
Now Catford in his uh uh article the teaching of English as
a foreign language which was which was published in nineteen hundred
fifty says that the concept of intelligibility has to be related
 to the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness in a speech
situation 
So he wants that we should relate the concept of intelligibility to
the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness in a speech situation
Now Kachru adds to these to the parametre of the context of
situation 
Kachru talks of the context of situation now
Uh so I I Indian English has all of you know
 is used in uh socio-cultural context 
It is used even 
So Indian English as uh most of you know is used mainly in
Indian socio-cultural educational and administrative contexts 
 I Indian English has been used as a link language as a
 official language
So we need to take into consideration the context of situation
Now uh uh talking about the phonology or the
phonological aspect of Indian English it may be said that uh we
should give more importance to the meaning rather than the noise 
Now I would like to refer to J R one word book uh
 Speech which was published in nineteen hundred and
thirty-three and uh which was reprinted in nineteen hundred sixty-six 
Now J R one word says that uh uh meaning is as much
 a property of the situational context of people as the noise is 
So meaning is necessary and that's why uh I
think you see it would uh not be sensible at all to present the
speaker of R P as the model for spoken English uh to a junior
class in a village in India 
Uh it would not be possible uh uh it would not be sensible and
it wouldn't it would not be even necessary 
Now it has been claimed that uh uh Indians need not
concentrate much on the spoken form 
It has been claimed you see means when you uh take into
consideration the aspect of communication 
Uh now it is said that uh the meaning should be taken into
consideration rather than the noise that we make 
So the role of English in India has been to integrate 
culturally and linguistically the pluralistic societies within India 
And uh it has never been the primary aim of uh English in India
 to integrate with the British or American culture 
American culture and that's why we did not pay
much attention you see to the spoken aspect 
But uh we should rather concentrate on the written communication
So throughout the years Indians accepted English they
acculturated English and uh the acculturated English is what we
call Indian English what we call Indian English
So this linguistic assimilation that has taken place 
 in with regard to English in India may be
compared to it may be compared to the Indianisation of Persian language
 or the Dravidianisation of Sanskrit language or even the
Indo-Aryanisation of Dravidian languages in India 
It may be compared uh to these now 
Bhatia uh presents four criteria on the basis of
which he would establish Indian English as a non-native variety 
For the first criterion about which he talks is that in
India English is learnt from the school stage of education 
So before uh uh before a boy starts before a boy or a girl
 uh starts learning English he or she has already learnt the
mother tongue 
She has already learnt the mother tongue
So the use of English in India has been from fine to formal
 or sometimes even informal situation 
But uh uh English in India is never used for intimate
situations 
It is never used for intimate situation 
Uh so uh the according to him you see the second
criterion is this the intimate situations are not the region
of uh Indian English 
Then a non-native speaker has limited facility to use the
various registors of the language 
So the native speaker can use all the registors of the language
whereas uh uh Indians in uh Indians cannot use all the registors
of language 
Then as a non-native variety English in India has uh 
phonetic syntactic and symantic deviations 
So these deviations even would establish India English as a
non-native variety 
Now Bansal objected to Prator's observations
Uh Bansal Bansal infact you see uh wrote uh in his 
nineteen hundred sixty-nine article that the subjective element or the
 uh or the puritan attitude which uh Prator had been
representing in his criticism of Indian English was altogetherly wrong
So uh Bansal tried to measure the intelligibility of Indian
English 
So he wanted to establish that Indian in Indian English is
intelligible as against Prator's criticism of Indian English as
uintelligible 
So uh he uh came to the conclusion that uh an
average figure of intelligibility between educated Indian speaker and R P
speaker is seventy-three percent is seventy-three precent 
So uh Indian English cannot be dismissed as unintelligible
variety of English 
So his study was based on a on recorded specimens of English of
the Indian speech community and uh it described even the phonetic
features of Indian English speech which uh differ from the R P
 Bansal's nineteen hundred seventy-two study was an
attempt to analyse and describe the common core of language patterns
 the common core of language patterns 
Now uh later on you see perk even Quirk talked of the 
uh nuclei the nuclear English 
He talked about the nuclear English later on Quirk 
Now the common core uh of course uh uh one of the
conclusions I would be arriving at would be that when it comes
to the common core Indian English does not differ much from 
British English 
So this would be one of the conclusions uh at which I would
like to arrive at the end 
So Bansal wanted to uh find out if it was possible
to have the common core shared by all the members of Indian speech
community all the members of Indian speech community
Now he said you see uh now of course you see in India 
English is used for uh a variety of purposes 
But Bansal compares the variedness of Indian English with that of
human behaviour 
So he says human behaviour when we talk of human behaviour 
we concentrate on similarity and not on differences 
So in the same way we should think of this similar uh the
similar aspects or the similar features and uh that would enable us 
to have a common core for the spoken Indian English 
Now Verma uh describes Indian English as an offspring yielded
by English a second language with a distinct Indian flavour 
He would describe Indian English as one of the languages of India
 used by a community of people at different levels of communication
So and then further he says within the overall general
framework of the basic linguistic systems of British English it displays
certain distinguishing features and uh he would say it is the
interlanguage situation that contributes to the distinct status of Indian
English 
So he would say that it will be interlanguage situation
So his concentration is on the interlanguage situation 
So Verma did not want Indian English to be grouped 
with American English Canadian English and Australian English because
 he said these are the mother tongue varieties whereas Indian English
is a non-native second language variety it is a non- native second
language variety 
Now as I told you before Daswani would not accept Indian
English as a variety of British British English 
So but uh there is some positive element in his
criticism of Indian English 
He says if systematic relations uh if systematic
relationship between varieties of English such as American Australian
Canadian English and Indian English is established then only Indian
English may be accepted as uh a variety of British English 
So the relationship between the mother tongue variety
 and the Indian English needs to be established and then only we
would accept Indian English as a variety of British English 
Now if you know you see uh Chowmsky would uh say that 
uh the divergencies this when we talk of a language when we talk
of a a a language let us say uh divergencies at the divergencies are
shown at the level of surface structure rather than at the level of
deep structure rather than at the level of deep structure 
So Daswani says that it has not yet been proved that face
structure rules of British English and Indian English are the same 
are the same and that the difference is only in the area of uh 
transformational and phonological rules 
So only when it would be proved that at the level of deep
structure Indian English is the same as British English and
uh only at the level of uh the surface structure Indian English
differs from British English then only we may accept Indian English as a
variety of British English
This is what uh uh Daswani would say 
Uh Daswani also comments on the eratic use of articles and
prepositions in Indian English 
He even comments on the phoneic interference on account of
negligence of some phonological rules 
So we uh infact do not know certain rules and we ignore
certain rules and that's why there is phonic interference in Indian
English 
So he would say uh he would say you see it is out of our
 ignorance it is out of uh our ignorance or negligience that uh
 we use uh different structures 
We use different structures and that's why Indian English
is not a variety of uh British English 
This is Daswani's uh point of view
