Uh  as much
information about Indian English  as possible during these two lectures
""
""
 there has been a lot of
work  Indian
English 
""
So 
just giving you 
the establishment of 
""
So most of you  Indian
English 
the Indians 
""
Uh there have been several  attempts to establish the identity of
Indian English through investigations into its major distinctive features
""
""
Uh the seminar on Indian English 
Hyderabad in nineteen hundred seventy-two  may be described as the first
collective effort  some definite conclusions regarding
""
""
Now the conclusion  Indian English is
not a substandard English  it is not
just British English with a few Indian spices  it has its
own distinct identity 
""
So these were the conclusions 
on  arrived
you see 
""
So  published
 the papers which were presented at
the seminar  Indian writing in English
""
""
Now as the title of the book suggests  the emphasis was on
Indian writing in English  attempted to describe
 phonological and syntactic features of Indian English
""
And one of the papers was  one of the papers was
by Kachru 
""
Now 
Englishmen considered  Indian English as a substandard variety of British
English 
""
Uh now for instance you see certain  uh derogatory terms were
used to describe Indian English  butler
English 
""
Now you get reference 
Bernell's  I'm
 uh which was
published in Eighteen hundred eighty-six 
""
Uh 
and  on uh
 Indian writing in English which was published in Harward educational
review  Arey Bhai
slof 
""
So uh  Indian
English  and uh probably the
Indians even did not think of Indian English  having its own
distinct identity 
""
But uh  made over years by Indian
English linguists  creative writers and teachers of English
have now established  English
""
""
Now I would uh  uh comment on you see Indian English as a non-
native variety of English 
""
Now some  Indian
English as a non-native variety of English whereas some  uh researchers
 some researchers like Daswani he would not accept
""
""
Uh  talked of uh Indian
English this I have provided you with uh  and uh
there are  I'm
""
lecture you see 
""
So Prator 
unintelligible model of English 
""
So he said this is a local model 
uh he objected to the setting  of the local variety of English
instead of R P 
""
So he insisted that R P should be the model for the learners 
and there should not be uh  present the local
variety of English 
""
Now 
""
He said it was uh  it is the he said you see it was the
heretical tenet  for the
learning of the pronunciation 
""
Now uh you probably might be knowing you see it was Bansal who
insisted that there should be 
the teaching of pronunciation 
""
Uh so far  uh there have been some attempts you see but so far
 a local model
""
Probably it would be possible in future when  I C E
project will 
""
I C E project that is the international corpus of English project
 being carried out you see
""
And the for the first time you would be uh  for the first time
you see the spoken aspect of Indian English  is taken into consideration
""
""
So later on  possible that the
local model 
""
So Prator  the basic principle
regarding intelligibility  uh
unintelligible he seems to have ignored the 
""
Now Catford  uh article the teaching of English as
a foreign language which was  which was published in nineteen hundred
fifty  has to be related
 in a speech
situation 
""
So he wants that we should relate the concept of intelligibility to
the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness  in a speech situation
""
""
Now Kachru adds to these  to the parametre of the context of
situation 
""
Kachru talks of the context of situation now
""
Uh  all of you know
""
""
It is used even 
""
So Indian English as uh  is used mainly in
Indian socio-cultural educational and administrative contexts 
""
 as a link language as a
 official language
""
So we need to take into consideration  the context of situation
""
""
Now uh  or the
phonological aspect of Indian English  we
should give more 
""
Now I would like to refer to J R  uh
 in nineteen hundred and
thirty-three and uh which was reprinted in nineteen hundred sixty-six 
""
Now J R  uh meaning is as much
""
""
So meaning is necessary  uh I
think you see it would uh  to present the
speaker of R P  uh to a junior
class in a village in India 
""
Uh it would not be possible uh  uh it would not be sensible and
it wouldn't it would not be even necessary 
""
Now it has been claimed  need not
concentrate much on the spoken form 
""
It has been claimed you see means when you  uh take into
consideration 
""
Uh now it is said that  uh the meaning should be taken into
consideration rather than the noise that we make 
""
So the role of English in India has been 
culturally and linguistically 
""
And uh it has never been the primary aim of  uh English in India
""
""
American culture and  pay
much attention you see to the 
""
But uh we should rather concentrate on the written communication
""
""
So throughout the years  they
acculturated English  is what we
call Indian English  what we call Indian English
""
So this linguistic assimilation 
 may be
compared to  it may be compared to the Indianisation of Persian language
 the
Indo-Aryanisation of Dravidian languages in India 
""
It may be compared 
""
Bhatia  on the basis of
which he would establish Indian English as a non-native variety 
""
For the first  in
India English is learnt 
""
So before  before a boy or a girl
 he or she has already learnt the
mother tongue 
""
She has already learnt the mother tongue
""
So  from fine to formal
""
""
But uh  intimate
situations 
""
It is never used for intimate situation 
""
Uh so  according to him you see the second
criterion is this  the region
of uh Indian English 
""
Then a non-native speaker  limited facility to use the
various registors 
""
So the native speaker can use all the registors of the language
whereas uh  cannot use all the registors
of language 
""
Then 
phonetic 
""
So these deviations even would establish  India English as a
non-native variety 
""
Now Bansal  observations
""
""
Uh Bansal 
nineteen hundred sixty-nine article  that the subjective element or the
 had been
representing in his criticism of  Indian English was altogetherly wrong
""
""
So uh  Bansal tried to measure the intelligibility of Indian
English 
""
So he wanted to establish  in Indian English is
intelligible  criticism of Indian English as
uintelligible 
""
So uh  an
average figure of intelligibility between educated Indian speaker  and R P
speaker 
""
So uh  Indian English cannot be dismissed as unintelligible
variety 
""
So his study was based on a  on recorded specimens of English of
the Indian speech community  the phonetic
features of Indian English speech  R P
""
""
 was an
attempt to analyse  the common core of language patterns
""
""
Now uh 
uh nuclei the nuclear 
""
He talked about the nuclear English later on Quirk 
""
Now  uh one of the
conclusions  when it comes
to 
British English 
""
So this would be one of the conclusions  uh at which I would
like to arrive at the end 
""
So Bansal  if it was possible
to have the common core  all the members of Indian speech
community  all the members of Indian speech community
""
Now he said you see 
English is used for uh 
""
But Bansal compares the variedness of Indian English with that of
human behaviour 
""
So he says human behaviour when we 
we concentrate on similarity 
""
So in the same way we should think of this similar  uh the
similar aspects or the similar features 
to have 
""
Now Verma  uh describes Indian English as an offspring yielded
by English 
""
He would describe Indian English as one of the languages of India
 levels of communication
""
""
So  and then further he says within the overall general
framework of the basic linguistic systems of British English  it displays
certain distinguishing features  it is the
interlanguage situation  that contributes to the distinct status of Indian
English 
""
So  he would say that it will be interlanguage situation
""
So his concentration is on the interlanguage situation 
""
So Verma 
with American English  and Australian English because
 whereas Indian English
is a non-native  it is a non- native second
language variety 
""
Now as I told you before  would not accept Indian
English as a variety of British 
""
So  element in his
criticism of Indian English 
""
He says  uh if systematic
relationship between varieties of English  American Australian
Canadian English and Indian English is established  Indian
English may be accepted as 
""
So  the mother tongue variety
 and then only we
would accept Indian English as a variety of British English 
""
Now if you know you see 
uh the  when we talk
of a  uh divergencies at the divergencies are
shown  rather than at the level of
deep structure 
""
So Daswani says that  face
structure rules of British English 
are the same 
transformational 
""
So only when  that at the level of deep
structure  and
uh  the surface structure Indian English
differs from British English then only we may accept Indian English  as a
variety of British English
""
This is what uh 
""
Uh Daswani also comments on the eratic use of articles and
prepositions 
""
He even comments on the phoneic interference  on account of
negligence of some phonological rules 
""
So we  and we ignore
certain rules and  why there is phonic interference in Indian
English 
""
So he would say uh  out of our
 that uh
""
""
We use different structures and  why Indian English
is not a variety 
""
This is
