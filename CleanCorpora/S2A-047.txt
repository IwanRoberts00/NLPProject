information about Indian English  as possible during these two lectures
""
""
""
""
English 
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Hyderabad in nineteen hundred seventy-two  may be described as the first
""
""
""
""
""
just British English with a few Indian spices  it has its
""
""
""
""
you see 
""
""
 the papers which were presented at
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Englishmen considered  Indian English as a substandard variety of British
""
""
""
used to describe Indian English  butler
English 
""
""
Bernell's  I'm
 uh which was
published in Eighteen hundred eighty-six 
""
""
and  on uh
""
""
slof 
""
""
English  and uh probably the
Indians even did not think of Indian English  having its own
""
""
""
English linguists  creative writers and teachers of English
have now established  English
""
""
""
""
""
Now some  Indian
""
""
""
""
""
English this I have provided you with uh  and uh
there are  I'm
""
lecture you see 
""
""
unintelligible model of English 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He said it was uh  it is the he said you see it was the
""
""
""
Now uh you probably might be knowing you see it was Bansal who
insisted that there should be 
""
""
Uh so far  uh there have been some attempts you see but so far
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
unintelligible he seems to have ignored the 
""
""
""
""
""
situation 
""
So he wants that we should relate the concept of intelligibility to
""
""
""
Now Kachru adds to these  to the parametre of the context of
situation 
""
Kachru talks of the context of situation now
""
Uh  all of you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we need to take into consideration  the context of situation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in nineteen hundred and
""
""
Now J R  uh meaning is as much
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it wouldn't it would not be even necessary 
""
Now it has been claimed  need not
""
""
It has been claimed you see means when you  uh take into
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 may be
compared to  it may be compared to the Indianisation of Persian language
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For the first  in
""
""
So before  before a boy or a girl
""
mother tongue 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of uh Indian English 
""
Then a non-native speaker  limited facility to use the
various registors 
""
""
""
""
""
Then 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
nineteen hundred sixty-nine article  that the subjective element or the
""
representing in his criticism of  Indian English was altogetherly wrong
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uintelligible 
""
""
""
""
""
So uh  Indian English cannot be dismissed as unintelligible
""
""
So his study was based on a  on recorded specimens of English of
""
features of Indian English speech  R P
""
""
 was an
""
""
""
Now uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
British English 
""
So this would be one of the conclusions  uh at which I would
like to arrive at the end 
""
So Bansal  if it was possible
""
community  all the members of Indian speech community
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
similar aspects or the similar features 
""
""
""
""
""
He would describe Indian English as one of the languages of India
""
""
""
""
""
certain distinguishing features  it is the
interlanguage situation  that contributes to the distinct status of Indian
""
""
So  he would say that it will be interlanguage situation
""
So his concentration is on the interlanguage situation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
English as a variety of British 
""
So  element in his
""
""
He says  uh if systematic
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now if you know you see 
""
of a  uh divergencies at the divergencies are
""
deep structure 
""
""
structure rules of British English 
""
""
""
""
""
""
differs from British English then only we may accept Indian English  as a
""
""
""
""
""
prepositions 
""
He even comments on the phoneic interference  on account of
""
""
""
certain rules and  why there is phonic interference in Indian
English 
""
So he would say uh  out of our
 that uh
""
""
We use different structures and  why Indian English
""
""
""
