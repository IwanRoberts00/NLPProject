<I>
So you are doing this work no the project 
 Haan I'm what I'm
 doing is he has collected some cassettes and uh how you how
the English is spoken in different uh like how do you speak English
in classrooms colleges uhm and how do you uh while
conversation while conversing how do you talk and all 
So he has recorded all those in that uhm all
those in the cassettes 
And I have to input them just 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Only just typing work you printed out over there
 Yeah one word 
Just typing work I have to do 
Not writing the program and all and execution execution
 It's not like that laughs 
But uh this these languages what I'm learning 
na they are completely different completely different from what
 I'm what the work he is doing like 
Why I asked you is because I wanted to know how you can
use those languages
 Haan haan 
Like 
No you can use them 
Uh like it is not be like our courses like if you
do and all those 
Uhm
Like we work whatever theory we learnt uhm
 that is actually totally not applicable
 Uhm 
Ahn ha 
Uh in practice
Practice yeah 
You know like what are the metric system 
 one word on paper
 One word 
 Haan haan 
Ahn 
Actually it is uh in practice we use the uh foot and
pound or those F P S system
Uhm uhm
All those
Yeah yeah 
So you have to convert all those in the metric system 
 Yeah everything is done in one word 
and one word and all those things 
So what are you doing is very
Conversion it becomes difficult like
 Difficult 
Difficult in the sense you can't be uh if I say
this room is three metre uh if any then I can't just
immedietly convert it like
Yeah 
Or if anyone asks uh what is size of this say this big big
column
Uhm 
So I can I can be able to I would be able to 
tell him uh metric system 
 Metric system 
That will become difficult and common people they 
don't understand
You have to take paper yeah and sit
 Yeah 
So like that I thought in in practice it will be like
Theory and practice
But it's completely different 
Now suppose if I go like I have completed my D C M
Yeah 
If I go as a programmer and all what I have to do so
that I'll I probably may not be knowing
Yeah
I thought that way 
Yeah 
You have to learn from someone what is to be done and then
you have to do that according to it at least you are a one word 
 I thought like that
No no 
 One word 
Then what are your what all subjects are you having 
Uh I'll tell you later uhn 
Uhm
Because I don't have have that
syllabus right now 
 What do you mean 
Like uh what are your subjects you learnt in civil 
In civil
Yeah 
In civil uh construction management construction and
uh that irrigation and hydro-electrician 
 One word in diploma one word 
Then that environmental engineering
Uhm uhm
And applied electronics all those uh designing of sectors
 theory of sector like that all those 
Now again now a days actually you know in America and all 
everything is done on uh by machine
Uhm uhm
Only in India there is manual work
Yeah laughs 
So now now a days most of job one see is it
requires uh this like uh amp ample of plenty of 
time 
 Time yeah 
It consumes and if you want to do some changes again you
have to consume a lot of time over there
Yeah 
So on computer it becomes easy uh like I have seen one
paper two words you know this uh we had the programme of the
design of uh Taj Mahal and so we got it making changes according
to one word his point of view
Yeah 
There is one knob and you just fix on uh moving it
Uhm uhm 
And it goes on changing 
Uhm uhm
So that give me the inspiration like 
Uhm uhm
I could do all that
Uhm uhm
Like 
You are doing it on the computer
Yeah graphics
Graphics
Yeah all graphics and uh 
So how to like interior also you can do now this so
that will be the next step
Yeah
Like because this knowledge now now a days what 
I'm learn learn what we are learning it is twenty years old
Yeah 
This is twenty years old out of India yeah 
outside India
 Yeah 
Yeah 
So now you want to yeah use it like
 Yeah 
We should no some advance technique computers and some
Yeah
So that and apply it accordingly
Yeah
 That's why I'm uh I want to learn
Yeah 
 That's why I was telling these problems are one
word admission over there one word 
So now it's quite difficult 
Yeah it will it should be like and according to my
point of view I don't know how far it will be applicable 
but it should be 
Yeah 
Like once you are intro introduced to that
system so it becomes easy for you to grasp
Yeah
Like you know you have to one word and all those
things
Uhm 
You know this was there is uh little bit of uh
computers
Uhm 
Like just a basic knowledge and uh some small
programmes and all like to design structures road traffic and all 
you know
I don't know any thing about these one word 
 Two words 
Uhn that only manual just theoritically 
 one word I know but uh regarding deep knowledge I am
not having about it
 One word 
So flat now whatever flat designing and all actually
if you start uh calculating the designs structural
design of the building uhm then it becomes like uh taking
all the loads and all accurately
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm 
It becomes very difficult
 Two words 
And also it takes long time
Long time 
So with on on computer it will be able to
computerise 
 You're able to computerise 
Computerise everthing now 
Yeah
What you all have done in Diploma one word 
 It's good simultaneously doing B E in civil
Like it's useless just doing going on doing the same
yeah
Yeah
If you do something
Yeah 
What all a few words 
Now when af after completing my B E I 
shouldn't feel that I should have done computer 
Now everything has been computerised
Yeah 
So I'm lagging I shouldn't feel
that I'm lagging behind like 
 Lagging behind yeah 
I should immedietly get a job
Or I yeah should I should immedietly start my own
because actually see now in uh say in civil actually girls are 
very few like
 Yeah 
Yeah 
Hardly now this year I I think so I'll be the only
girl in my class
My God laughs 
Yeah like that 
And uh usually there are no girls in this field
So now again after completing my B E if I if I work as site
engineer it will be difficult
Uhm
So this year also I saw after my diploma also many of
the guys like my classmates they got job
Uhm uhm
But I it was difficult for me because la 
they don't prefer ladies like site engineers and all those things
Yeah
And designing then they want all those uh uh this uh
technical students because they can uh use them for just uh few 
like uh pay
Yeah
Ahn two hundred three hundred four hundred rupees
Uhn uhn 
So that is for for diploma engineer you yeah
 need something na 
 Yeah 
Yeah 
Just can't work on atleast you for
experience you can work without taking any 
Uhm uhm
Uhn salary or something
Uhm uhm 
But uh you can't just go and yeah 
and say I'll I'll work uh for a hundred rupees
 Yeah 
Uhm uhm
Or two hundred rupees that two words
 no
Yeah 
So that is two words actually 
And even I've seen I have seen many of my friends my
classmates
Only in my class there were eight girls
Uhm uhm 
Uh whole year for diploma 
Now they are working here for just some two fifty four hundred
five hundred two words 
You are working here 
Yeah in Kolhapur 
In Kolhapur 
Now actually my uh some of my friends they have 
their own firm 
So whenever they need me they call me
Uhm uhm 
And they ask me to come for designing and all
Even from for letter drafting like
we have some mutual relations like
Uhm
Homely relation family relation like 
So I I do their work but I don't take anything 
If at all one word my some some uh min
 minor expenses and all
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Like petrol and all
Sometimes they give like
Uhn 
Means like if they take my bike laughs 
Uhn uhn 
They put the petrol and give one word and like
that
Uh like uh 
 All the maintenance work and all they do
Uhm
Like for a bike or whatever it is
Uhm
So I don't get a salary as such because and that
too uh their job is like they are out of uh like
Out field 
Uh they don't they don't have a office
or anything like that
This is where you gain experience na 
Yeah
Well and good
 I'll be whenever they need me they call me
Uhn 
 I'll go to their house
Uhm
Then they tell me whatever even from for
 letter drafting
Yours is like 
Yeah ours is like 
 One word clearly discuss one word and we do 
But I don't like a working like like a job
and like a boss and uh this thing employee
Yeah 
I don't like that relation like
Uhm 
So it becomes difficult na 
There should be a friendly relationship between
 Yeah 
Yeah friendly relation 
So those uh they have their own firm like not a 
one word not a full fledged firm 
It is not a full fledged firm
Uhm 
So but just if you say this it is just the
beginning
Yeah 
So we just helping them 
So sometimes I go over there
Uhm uhm 
So say for six months I have been assisting them
Uhm 
So now atleast whenever they and their main job
 one word they do many one word like they have many this one
what you call distributorship and one word agencies 
and all 
So they have to go out
 Uhn ha 
Uhm uhm
In the morning and in the afternoon and all if at all any
 if uh even if they have to draft any a single letter for any company and
all they ask me
Uhm 
In English it has to be done and everything English
 In English yeah 
So my English writing is better uhm than
what I talk
 Uhm 
Yeah 
Then that's why they call
No you talk well laughter 
And over here since we uh after my college uh school 
 uhm after uh tenth
 Uhm 
Uhm
So ever since uh my since eighty-nine I have not
spoken I have not spoken English or Kannada to anyone
Why
With anyone here 
Why why
Like in the class in my college like uh it is
some what odd
Yeah 
Or people think uh talking in English is somewhat 
Yeah showing off
Yeah showing off laughs 
So that accent is losing uhn here
You lose 
Yeah 
 Two words 
When you have uh some when you learnt any language or
something you should have a mastery if you are in contact with it
 if you are in touch with it then you'll have the
mastery or hold or you get an accent or like that
 Yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
Yeah 
Right from the one word school days itself
Now see 
 One word six years have passed
Uhm yeah I think yeah six years have passed 
So over here everything
You are an English medium student I think
Yeah English medium
Then you should be in touch with English language
Yeah but over here they literally no one speaks in
English
Yeah 
Everyone speaks 
 One word pure Marathi 
Generally every time
Even Kannada I'm literally I am forgetting
everything laughs 
And I actually it's becoming difficult for me to read
Yeah 
Because I have I have never read anything since after my
You learnt it Kannada language 
 Yeah 
I had a subject no one word two words
 
 Two words 
From eighth 
From eighth yeah 
Some fifty marks uh something like that 
Third language 
I scored thirty-three in it out of fifty
