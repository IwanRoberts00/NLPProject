<I>
""
""
So you are doing this work no 
""
""
 I'm
 how
the English is spoken  how do you speak English
in classrooms  uh while
conversation 
""
So he has  all
those in the cassettes 
""
And I have to input them just 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 typing work you printed out over there
""
""
""
""
""
Just typing work I have to do 
""
""
Not writing the program and all and execution  execution
""
""
""
""
""
But uh this 
na  completely different from what
""
""
""
Why I asked you is because  I wanted to know how you can
use those languages
""
""
""
""
""
Like 
""
""
No you can use them 
""
""
Uh like it is not  like if you
do and all those 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Like we work  uhm
 that is actually totally not applicable
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn ha 
""
""
Uh in practice
""
""
Practice yeah 
""
""
You know like 
 on paper
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
Actually it is  uh foot and
pound or those F P S system
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
All those
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
So you have to convert all those in the metric 
""
""
""
and 
""
""
So what are you doing is very
""
""
Conversion it becomes  like
""
""
""
""
""
Difficult in the sense you  uh if I say
this room is three metre  just
immedietly convert it like
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Or if anyone asks  uh what is size of this say this big big
column
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So I can 
tell him 
""
""
""
""
""
That will become difficult and 
don't  understand
""
""
You have to take paper  and sit
""
""
""
""
""
So like that I thought  in in practice it will be like
""
""
Theory and practice
""
""
But 
""
Now suppose if I go  like I have completed my D C M
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
If I go as a programmer and all  so
that  I probably may not be knowing
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I thought that way 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You have to learn from someone what is to be done  and then
you have to do that according to it 
 I thought like that
""
""
No no 
""
""
""
""
""
Then what are your 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Because  have that
syllabus right now 
""
""
""
""
""
Like uh 
""
""
In civil
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
In civil uh construction management  and
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Then  that environmental engineering
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And applied electronics all those  uh designing of sectors
""
""
Now again 
everything is done on  uh by machine
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Only in India there is manual work
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So  it
requires uh 
time 
""
""
""
""
""
It consumes and if you want to do some changes  again you
have to  consume a lot of time over there
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So on computer it becomes easy  uh like I have seen one
paper  the
design of  changes according
to  his point of view
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
There is one knob and you just fix on  uh moving it
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And it goes on changing 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
So that give me the inspiration like 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
I could do all that
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Like 
""
""
You are doing it on the computer
""
""
Yeah graphics
""
""
Graphics
""
""
Yeah all graphics and uh 
""
So how to  so
that will be the next step
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Like 
I'm  what we are learning it is twenty years old
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
This is twenty years old 
outside India
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
So now you want to  use it like
""
""
""
""
""
We should no some advance technique  computers and some
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So that and apply it accordingly
""
""
Yeah
""
""
 uh I want to learn
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 one
word 
""
""
So now 
""
""
Yeah it will  and according to my
point of view 
but it should be 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Like once you are  introduced to that
system  so it becomes easy for you to grasp
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Like you know  and all those
things
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
You know this was  uh
computers
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Like  small
programmes and all 
you know
""
""
I 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn that only 
 deep knowledge I am
not having about it
""
""
""
""
""
So flat  actually
if you start uh  structural
design of the building  like uh taking
all the loads and all  accurately
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
It becomes very difficult
""
""
""
""
""
And also it takes long time
""
""
Long time 
""
""
So with  will be able to
computerise 
""
""
""
""
""
Computerise everthing now 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
What you all have done in Diploma 
""
""
 good simultaneously doing B E in civil
""
""
Like  useless just doing going on doing the same
yeah
""
""
Yeah
""
""
If you do something
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
What all 
""
""
Now when 
shouldn't 
""
Now everything has been computerised
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So  feel
that 
""
""
""
""
""
I should immedietly get a job
""
Or I  should I should immedietly start my own
because actually see 
very  few like
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Hardly now this year I I think so  be the only
girl  in my class
""
""
My God 
""
""
Yeah like that 
""
And uh  in this field
""
So now again  after completing my B E if I if I work as site
engineer it will be difficult
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So this year also I saw  many of
the guys like  my classmates they got job
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
But I 
they  prefer ladies like site engineers and all those things
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And designing then they want all those uh uh  this uh
technical students because 
like uh  pay
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Ahn two hundred three hundred four hundred  rupees
""
""
""
Uhn uhn 
""
""
So that is  yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Just  for
experience you can work 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Uhn salary or something
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
But uh you 
and say  rupees
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Or two hundred  two words
 no
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So that is 
""
And even  my
classmates
""
Only in my class there were eight girls
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Uh whole year for diploma 
""
Now they are working here for just  some two fifty four hundred
five hundred 
""
""
You are working here 
""
""
Yeah in Kolhapur 
""
""
In Kolhapur 
""
""
Now actually my uh 
their own firm 
""
So whenever they need me they call me
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And they ask  me to come for designing and all
""
Even  like
we have some mutual relations like
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Homely relation family 
""
So I 
""
If at all  min
 minor expenses and all
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Like petrol and all
""
Sometimes they give like
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Means like if they take my bike 
""
""
Uhn uhn 
""
""
They put the petrol and give  and like
that
""
""
Uh 
""
""
 maintenance work and all they do
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Like for a bike or whatever it is
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So I  because and that
too  uh their job is like they are out of uh like
""
""
Out field 
""
""
Uh they  have a office
or anything like that
""
""
This is where you gain experience 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Well and good
""
""
 be whenever they need me they call me
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
 go to their house
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Then they tell me whatever  for
 letter drafting
""
""
Yours is like 
""
""
Yeah ours is like 
""
""
""
But I  like like a job
and  employee
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
I  like that relation like
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So it becomes difficult 
""
There should  a friendly relationship between
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah friendly relation 
""
""
So those uh 
one word 
""
It is not a full fledged firm
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So but  it is just the
beginning
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So we just helping them 
""
So sometimes I go over there
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
So say for six months I have been assisting them
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So  and their main job
 like they have many this one
what you call 
and all 
""
So they have to go out
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
In the morning and  in the afternoon and all if at all any
 if uh even if they have to draft any a single letter for any company and
all  they ask me
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
In English it has to be done and everything  English
""
""
""
""
""
""
So my English writing is  than
what I talk
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Then  why they call
""
""
No you talk well 
""
""
And over here since we 
 after uh tenth
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So ever since  I have not
spoken  I have not spoken English or Kannada to anyone
""
""
Why
""
""
With anyone here 
""
""
Why why
""
""
Like in the class  it is
some what odd
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Or people think uh 
""
""
Yeah showing off
""
""
Yeah showing off 
""
So that accent is losing uhn  here
""
""
You lose 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
When you have  when you learnt any language or
something  if you are in contact with it
 have the
mastery or hold  or like that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Right from the  school days itself
""
""
Now see 
""
""
 six years have passed
""
""
Uhm yeah 
""
""
So over here everything
""
""
You are an English medium student I think
""
""
Yeah  English medium

""
Then  you should be in touch with English language
""
""
Yeah  literally no one speaks in
English
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Everyone 
""
""
""
""
Generally every time
""
""
Even Kannada  literally I am forgetting
everything 
""
And I actually  becoming difficult for me to read
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Because I have  I have never read anything since after my
""
""
You learnt it 
""
""
""
""
""
I had a subject no  two words
""
""
""
""
""
""
From eighth 
""
""
From eighth yeah 
""

""
""

""
""
