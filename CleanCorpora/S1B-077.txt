And we have already  mentioned

""
I hope the members approve 
""
Now about 
""
After this report uh  the
previous general body meeting 
""
Uh about teachers problems which are pending so far  we'll
""
""
But what has been done during  I
think can be stated in a very brief manner 
""
The President  and the member of the executive
council of  national executive
council meeting  on eighth March nineteen
ninety-four in Delhi 
""
At the same time they participated 
and 
""
Where the major demands were  that
is appointment of a panel for 
""
Number two  which have been pending for
a long time  India regarding
inclusion of  in
the total length of service for placement purposes 
""
Number three  promotion of Readers to Professors in the
universities 
""
But these were the three important major demands  uh which were
presented by  on the
Parliament 
""
And I am very happy to 
immediately at the same time  uh the minister for Human Resources
Development  you
know group of people representing 
""
They had a discussion 
""
Subsequently the U G C Chairman also invited a larger contingent
 where again most of the pending problems of the
teachers were discussed 
""
And uh  uh the most
important demand  uh has been
considered by  uh a committee for pay revision of
college and university teachers has been appointed  uh under the
chairmanship of 
""
Uh as a result of which incidently the thirty-first  uh July
 one word
""
""
Subsequent to that  casual manner I
would say 
where perhaps for the first time  organised some
cultural activities after a long gap 
""
Uh one was that  uh Laxman Deshpande
 kutumba
""
""
Then uh comes the mention regarding  the efforts made by
 for
installing  a good teacher
""
""
Every year to be awarded  on the day of the University
foundation 
""
Incidently  the announcement by
the authorities  for
only non-teaching employees of the university 
""
Not only that  of
non-teaching employees of the university they were to be given some prizes
for their 
""
When that circular  some of the office
bearers of  we immediately rushed to the
university authorities  and then
subsequently a written demand was placed  that the teachers are also
employees of the university  and they also must be considered for this
kind of treatment  in the subsequent executive council
meetings of the university the demand of the teachers was considered and I
hope  eighteenth November nineteen
ninety-four 
""
And uh let us hope  uh some of you is going to bag that award
""
""
Then 
women's 
""
A report has been prepared by that committee 
""
The report will be presented to the body 
""
Then as you all remember we organised 
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four 
""
We have also submitted a demand to the university authorities
regarding 
""
Uh they have been issued to the non-teaching employees  and
again we were 
""
And only after we approached the authorities and uh  brought it
to their notice  that similar
laminated I-cards will be issued 
""
Then  we have submitted another representation to the
university authorities regarding  problems of the
 one
word 
""
Their problems relate mainly to  cofusion regarding
new facilities  academic
non-vacational 
""
They are entitled to 
of the 
""
That kind of a demand has been placed  enquiries are
being made with the U G C as well as 
""
Recently  according to the
suggestion made  members
 very recently held to discuss Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen
ninety-four 
""
 some very important deficiencies in the Act were
discussed at that time  a committee be
constituted 
""
Uh we were supposed to 
""
I had been 
making request again and again 
""
Uh may be because of their other preoccupations  they were not
in a position to submit their 
""
Ultimately I had to prepare my own  uh note and I have sent a
note to the Government of Maharashtra  uh more particularly to the
Secretary 
""
Uh of course if you want the contents of the letter  I can read
them out 
""
Of course this is a very important 
""
So everybody should be aware of that uh 
to Honourable Pratima  Secretary Law and Judiciary
Department 
""
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four that is the
subject 
""
Madam  uh at the unanimous suggestion of the members of
 I in the capacity of Secretary seek your
permission to submit following modifications  for your kind consideration
and necessary action  Maharashtra
Act number thirty-five of nineteen ninety-four 
""
Number one 
as it will lead to awkward situations in the actual working of the university
""
becomes ex-officio member of management council of the university 
""
It would be more appropriate  the Senate of the
university 
""
I hope you remember  that in the selection committee for the
 a
committee of five persons  the
other nominee of the management council  the
nominee of the Univesity Grants Commission  the
secretary in-charge of higher and technical education  and the fifth is
the nominee of the 
""
""
Uh very interestingly  the position of the Secretary for higher
and technical education is  secondary to the position of a
Vice-chancellor  in the actual conduct or operation of this particular
Act  the secretary will be a member of the selection committee and
subsequently he will come to the executive council of this university and be
a member of the management council under the chairmanship of the the same
Vice-chancellor whom he appoints 
""
So both for him and for the Vice-chancellor perhaps  the things
would be very awkward  uh in a
recently conducted meeting of  uh sorry
""
agreed  this particular
point 
""
Uh let me clarify 
""
The academic council of the state university will have to nominate
another member 
""
The management council of the same university nominated one more
member  fourth member that
is one  rest of Maharashtra
 or something
like that 
""
And uh  the Secretary in-charge of higher and technical
education is not to be nominated 
""
He is automatically by his position  a member of the selection
committee
