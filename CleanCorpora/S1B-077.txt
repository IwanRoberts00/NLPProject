So the last meeting which perhaps was the first 
special meeting requisition was held on nineteenth April nineteen
ninety-four at three pm in the physics auditorium to discuss 
non issuance of convocation invitations to non one word 
teachers of this University 
In the meeting after the relevant documents were presented
 and after much of discussion about the issue involved it was
resolved that in future the attempt should be made by the
organisation to convene the authority that the teachers of the
University shall be issued invitations for the convocation 
that is all convocations to be held in future 
Now that was the only item to be discussed in that meeting 
and that constitutes the minute of the previous meeting 
The meeting preceeding this special meeting was held on
fifteenth January nineteen ninety-four 
In that meeting apart from the confirmation to the previous 
meeting minute in all twenty resolutions were passed 
I will just go on making mentions of the contents 
Number two resolution was related to felicitation of some
These are continuing one word 
Previously 
No two words 
No sir these were not confirmed interruption yeah not

The seventh resolution was uh it was resolved to request the
University authorities to modify existing quarter development rule on the
following lines 
And a number of rules were given such as fit 
They were submitted to the university authorities and after
taking due cognisance of the said rule the university authorities have
passed a kind of an order in that respect and I hope uh the
concerned circular has reached every department 
The next resolution was uh accepting the secretaries 
report 
Nineth resolution was regarding resolve to allow postal ballet
for Sholapur member etcetera because they cannot attend uh your
election meeting 
It may be very costly for them just for uh coming here and

perhaps two hundred rupees per head 
So they were allowed to vote by uh postal ballet 
Tenth resolution was resolving increase of the contribution of
the members by rupees five per month 
The eleventh resolution was resolved to make it obligatory for
 SUPTA members to be present for the national

Similarly in the case of date mentioned above in genuine

And the last resolution was resolved to write to the 
officer on special duty office for early payment of arrears and
revive pay fac uh pays failing which a notice be
issued simultaneously about a dharna uposhan to be
staged in front of his office in April nineteen ninety-four 
So these were the resolutions adopted in the previous general
body meeting 
And we have already uh men mentioned
 the resolution adopted in the last general body meeting
that is special general body meeting 
I hope the members approve 
Now about the Secretaries Report 
After this report uh relates to the period after the
previous general body meeting 
Uh about teachers problems which are pending so far we'll
 come to that issue at a later stage 
But what has been done during this intervening period I
think can be stated in a very brief manner in the following words 
The President the Secretary and the member of the executive
council of SUPTA attended national executive
council meeting of A I one word on eighth March nineteen
ninety-four in Delhi 
At the same time they participated in a morcha 
and dharna organised by the one word 
Where the major demands were number one pay revision that
is appointment of a panel for pay revision 
Number two uh earlier demands which have been pending for
a long time with the U G C and the Government of India regarding
inclusion of uh teaching experience as demonstrators and tutors in
the total length of service for placement purposes 
Number three promotion of Readers to Professors in the
universities and uh some minor things 
But these were the three important major demands uh which were
presented by the one word morcha on the
Parliament 
And I am very happy to uh report that uh subsequently 
immediately at the same time uh the minister for Human Resources
Development was very generous enough to invite a select uh you
know group of people representing one word 
They had a discussion 
Subsequently the U G C Chairman also invited a larger contingent
 uh for discussion where again most of the pending problems of the
teachers were discussed 
And uh as you might all be knowing recently uh the most
important demand that is appointment of a pay panel uh has been
considered by the U G C and uh a committee for pay revision of
college and university teachers has been appointed uh under the
chairmanship of Professor Rastogi 
Uh as a result of which incidently the thirty-first uh July
 uh sorry August demonstrations were cancelled by one word
 
Subsequent to that uh of course in a very casual manner I
would say I will have to uh recall to you the two days 
where perhaps for the first time SUPTA organised some
cultural activities after a long gap 
Uh one was that uh article show by uh Laxman Deshpande
 from Marathwada and another by Vishubai Bapat uh kutumba
 rangale kavyat 
Then uh comes the mention regarding the efforts made by
 SUPTA with the authorities of the University for
installing or instituting rather a prize for a good teacher
Every year to be awarded on the day of the University
foundation 
Incidently the whole affair began with the announcement by
the authorities that a prize of this nature will be instituted for
only non-teaching employees of the university 
Not only that uh the sons and daughters and ward of
non-teaching employees of the university they were to be given some prizes
for their excellent performances in the various examination 
When that circular uh was raised by some of the office
bearers of SUPTA we immediately rushed to the
university authorities discussed the matter with them and then
subsequently a written demand was placed that the teachers are also
employees of the university and they also must be considered for this
kind of treatment and fortunately in the subsequent executive council
meetings of the university the demand of the teachers was considered and I
hope on the first uh that is coming eighteenth November nineteen
ninety-four first of such awards will be issued uh awarded 
And uh let us hope uh some of you is going to bag that award
Then this womens' well 
women's cell committee conducted two meeting 
A report has been prepared by that committee 
The report will be presented to the body subsequently 
Then as you all remember we organised a discussion on the 
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four 
We have also submitted a demand to the university authorities
regarding uh issue of laminated I-cards 
Uh they have been issued to the non-teaching employees and
again we were perhaps forgotten 
And only after we approached the authorities and uh brought it
to their notice that they have agreed in principle that similar
laminated I-cards will be issued to the teachers also 
Then we have submitted another representation to the
university authorities regarding uh some particular problems of the
 Adult and Continuing Education department number one and one
word 
Their problems relate mainly to some cofusion regarding
new facilities whether these people that is academic
non-vacational employees of the university 
They are entitled to some kind of earned leave in lieu 
of the period for which they work during vacation 
That kind of a demand has been placed and uh enquiries are
being made with the U G C as well as the state government 
Recently just three days back uh according to the
suggestion made in the meeting of the SUPTA members
 very recently held to discuss Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen
ninety-four 
 The some very important deficiencies in the Act were
discussed at that time and it was suggested that a committee be
constituted uh Tandurkar myself uh Mr Kalme 
Uh we were supposed to prepare a draft 
I had been keeping in touch with these people 
making request again and again 
Uh may be because of their other preoccupations they were not
in a position to submit their uh notes or comments to me 
Ultimately I had to prepare my own uh note and I have sent a
note to the Government of Maharashtra uh more particularly to the
Secretary uh Department of Law 
Uh of course if you want the contents of the letter I can read
them out 
Of course this is a very important uh aspects of that Act 
So everybody should be aware of that uh reads the letter 
to Honourable Pratima one word Secretary Law and Judiciary
Department Government of Maharashtra Mantralaya Bombay 
Maharashtra Universities Act nineteen ninety-four that is the
subject 
Madam uh at the unanimous suggestion of the members of
 SUPTA I in the capacity of Secretary seek your
permission to submit following modifications for your kind consideration
and necessary action under Section one one six of the Act Maharashtra
Act number thirty-five of nineteen ninety-four 
Number one uh section twelve one A I should be deleted 
as it will lead to awkward situations in the actual working of the university
 because secretary higher education and technical education 
becomes ex-officio member of management council of the university 
It would be more appropriate to allow the Senate of the
university to nominate this person 
I hope you remember that in the selection committee for the
 Vice-chancellor's posting the new act provides for a
committee of five persons one nominee of the academic council the
other nominee of the management council the third would be the
nominee of the Univesity Grants Commission the fourth is the
secretary in-charge of higher and technical education and the fifth is
the nominee of the govern uh Governor 
Uh very interestingly the position of the Secretary for higher
and technical education is secondary to the position of a
Vice-chancellor and in the actual conduct or operation of this particular
Act the secretary will be a member of the selection committee and
subsequently he will come to the executive council of this university and be
a member of the management council under the chairmanship of the the same
Vice-chancellor whom he appoints 
So both for him and for the Vice-chancellor perhaps the things
would be very awkward and everybody has agreed to this even uh in a
recently conducted meeting of SUPTA uh sorry
 SUTA this point was raised and they have also 
agreed that something will have to be done regarding this particular
point 
Uh let me clarify U G C has to nominate one member 
The academic council of the state university will have to nominate
another member 
The management council of the same university nominated one more
member the Governor also has nominated the third fourth member that
is one uh Mr B G Deshmukh the chairman of the rest of Maharashtra
 what you call Vaidhanik Vikas Mandal or something
like that 
And uh the Secretary in-charge of higher and technical
education is not to be nominated 
He is automatically by his position a member of the selection
committee ex- official
