See children  talking about weathering
""
""
""
""
Now just behave as if  not learnt this chapter okay
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Your lips get cracked 
""
""
atmosphere  okay
""
""
""
""
temperature also affect other components 
""
""
rocks are also subjected to such wear and  okay
""
""
affected 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this is known as 
""
The softening  is termed as
""
""
""
""
""
Weathering
""
""
Okay
""
The wear and tear
""
""
or even in the hot summer season you find it very dry  okay
""
""
""
Similarly the rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear 
""
And this 
""
""
They are always exposed to the atmosphere 
""
""
""
""
""
Weathering
""
""
Okay
""
""
""
Yes Ranjeet  ?
""
""
""
""
weathering 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sit down take your seat  okay
""
""
okay
""
Chemical weathering and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
cause mechanical 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Expanded when cooled get  contracted
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this expansion and contraction  co
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
breaking up into 
""
""
sand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
variations in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The changes in atmospheric condition
""
""
weathering complete with this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Due to what  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The change in temperature
""
""
The change in temperature
""
The rise and fall in temperature
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
called mechanical weathering
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
""
I am talking of only mechanical weathering
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The small pieces travels and fallen into the tanks  when
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
gets more hot the rock uh expand
""
""
The temerature gets more hot or temperature rises
""
""
""
also get contracted
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
cough 
""
""
""
""
""
""
mechanical weathering 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this 
""
Now what is chemical weathering  ?
""
Now this rock material  contains various minerals present in it
""
""
Okay see
""
""
""
""
""
""
the various components of atmosphere
""
""
""
If you recall your  lower
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in the 
""
Then uh dust particles  these are all components of the
""
""
Now  now these chemical these components like water uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it is termed as 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
these 
""
""
""
And this is the 
""
And  changes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That the weathering can be classified into  mechanical we have
learnt mechanical and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
While  the
""
""
The chemical composition of the rock is changed
""
""
""
""
Gets changed  these components
""
Components like 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They act upon the components and the minerals of the rock and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
variations in temperature  uh uhm chemical composition
""
""
""
""
""
I hope you are familiar with the term weathered now
""
""
 ?
""
""
""
Now  the nature
""
""
Okay which act upon the different components in the atmosphere 
""
""
Now this external agent  can you tell me what are the external
""
""
Yes Raja  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rain water ground water 
""
""
Seawave 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Wind  seawave yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They go down in the  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and how the rocks get weathered  okay
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now we shall see how this rain water acts upon  the rock and
""
""
Okay the rain water which falls on the earth 
""
rock
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this rain water gets collected  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  when the temperature
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So what will happen ?
""
When they form ice it requires more places  and so therefore
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The crack 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It gets  broken up
""
""
So rain water is another factor 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
""
other than  even living beings
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 they weather the rock material and these
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
