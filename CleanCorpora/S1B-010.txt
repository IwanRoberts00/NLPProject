See children  talking about weathering
once again 
""
""
""
Now just behave as if  not learnt this chapter okay
""
""
""
Now 
""
""
It keeps on changing  okay
""
There is always  rise and fall
of the temperature  okay
""
Now 
human being our skin for example 
your skin get shrivelled 
""
It get shrivelled it get  cracked
""
Your lips get cracked 
""
So they are subject to 
atmosphere  okay
""
The rise and fall in the temperature 
""
Now similarly this atmospheric condition this rise and fall of the
temperature also affect other components 
""
Now like  similarly the
rocks are also subjected to such wear and  okay
""
Due to the rise and fall of the temperature  the rocks are also
affected 
""
Now how they are affected ?
""
 I will be discussing
that also shortly 
""
Now this wear and 
 changes in the
atmosphere  the rock and this
rock 
""
So this is known as 
""
The softening  is termed as
""
""
""
""
""
Weathering
""
""
Okay
""
The wear and tear
""
Like how our skin 
or even in the hot summer season you find it very dry  okay
""
You find your skin getting very dry
""
Similarly the rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear 
""
And this 
are exposed to the atmosphere always 
""
They are always exposed to the atmosphere 
""
This wear and tear of the rock  and the
breaking up of rock is termed as
""
""
Weathering
""
""
Okay
""
So could you repeat the definition weathering
""
Yes Ranjeet  ?
""
""
There are  of
 atmosphere upon the rock is called
weathering 
""
""
Yes of  upon uh
""
So the softening and the breaking up of rock  in geographical
term  weathering
""
""
""
""
""
Sit down take your seat  okay
""
Now this weathering 
okay
""
Chemical weathering and 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay
""
We classify this weathering into  and mechanical
""
""
Okay now what is this mechanical weathering  ?
""
That is mechanical weathering is caused  the
rise that difference in temperature 
cause mechanical 
""
So how does it take place ?
""
What happens to the rock because of the variations in temperature
 ?
""
What happens  ?
""
The rock gets 
when heated gets  expanded
""
""
""
""
""
Expanded when cooled get  contracted
""
""
""
""
""
Okay
""
So variations in temperature  ?
""
The rocks in the hot summer season  and when
the temperature falls in the winter season gets 
contracted
""
""
""
""
""
So this expansion and contraction  co
 what happens ?
""
The rock 
""
It gets weathered 
""
It gets weathered 
breaking up into 
small pieces  from gravel
into very fine particle 
sand 
""
So the sandy nature of the desert is the result of  ?
<$CH
""
""
""
""
Mechanical weathering
""
""
""
""
Mechanical  weathering
""
So this mechanical weathering is caused  the
variations in 
""
""
""
""
""
And the variations in temperatures are change in atmosphereic
conditions  okay
""
The changes in atmospheric condition
""
This  just recall what is mechanical
weathering complete with this 
""
How would you describe mechanical weathering  ?
""
""
The disintegration of rock
""
""
Yes the disintegration of rock right 
""
Due to what  ?
""
Disintegrate means what ?
""
Breaking up 
""
So why  ?
""
""
The change in temperature
""
""
The change in temperature
""
The rise and fall in temperature
""
Yes 
""
Manasi  ?
""
""
Teacher 
""
""
Just elaborate on the topic
""
""
Disintegration of the uh  rock into the chemical process is
called mechanical weathering
""
""
Yes
""
""
Due to chemical changes uh 
""
""
I am talking of only mechanical weathering
""
""
The changes in the physical temperature  so that rock
changes weathers it then uh it gets uh
""
""
How does it get weathered ?
""
""
The small pieces travels and fallen into the tanks  when
large pieces
""
""
But you haven't explained how does it get weathered  ?
""
How does it get weathered ?
""
If mechanical weathering  the variations in
""
""
""
""
""
""
So how does the variations in temperature affect rock ?
""
Okay let her answer
""
""
Changes in temperature affect rock  when the temperature
gets more hot the rock uh expand
""
""
The temerature gets more hot or temperature rises
""
""
The rock is expanded and when it cools down the rock the rock
also get contracted
""
""
Yes
""
""
Due to uh  uh
uh 
cough 
 form sand
""
""
Yes 
""
So the sandy nature of uh desert is the result of 
mechanical weathering 
""
""
""
""
""
Anything more to say  ?
""
Okay  okay
""
So this 
""
Now what is chemical weathering  ?
""
Now this rock material  contains various minerals present in it
""
""
Okay see
""
""
""
""
""
Now  atmosphere
the various components of atmosphere
""
What are the various components of atmosphere ?
""
If you recall your  lower
classes
""
What are the various components of atmosphere  ?
""
""
Water vapour oxygen gases
""
""
This  nitrogen oxygen
carbondioxide 
in the 
""
Then uh dust particles  these are all components of the
atmosphere
""
Now  now these chemical these components like water uh
carbondioxide  the chemical composition
of the 
""
""
""
""
""
And when the chemical composition of the rock is changed 
it is termed as 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
So the various other components of the atmosphere  like water
vapour  uh
these 
""
The chemical composition present in the rocks is changed 
""
And this is the 
""
And  changes
 even the chemical composition of the rock changes
""
Again it gets weathered 
""
And this can be termed as 
""
So we learnt what is weathering  the definition of weathering
""
""
That the weathering can be classified into  mechanical we have
learnt mechanical and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Mechanical is the result of  variations in
temperature 
""
""
""
""
""
While  the
""
""
The chemical composition of the rock is changed
""
""
The chemical composition of the rock is changed 
""
Gets changed  these components
""
Components like 
etcetera
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They act upon the components and the minerals of the rock and 
""
""
So this can be termed as 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
Now  the
variations in temperature  uh uhm chemical composition
getting changed because of the other components in the atmosphere
""
There are  other methods other ways also by
which 
""
I hope you are familiar with the term weathered now
""
What do you mean by weathering and what is weathering of the rock
 ?
""
Okay now various other factors are also there
""
Now  the nature
""
""
Okay which act upon the different components in the atmosphere 
okay
""
Now this external agent  can you tell me what are the external
agents of uh nature ?
""
Yes Raja  ?
""
""
""
""
""
External agents of nature  which acts upon the rocks
""
""
""
""
""
Water yes 
""
Rain water ground water 
""
""
Seawave 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Wind 
""
""
Wind  seawave yes
""
They all erode and 
the rock particles in the  okay
""
Now  the rain water which falls on the
earth surface  okay
""
They go down in the  in
 they
""
""
They  percolated into the
""
""
Other then that the rain water also 
responsible 
""
""
""
""
""
How  ?
""
How is the rain water responsible for weathering of rocks ?
""
We saw  affect the rock
and how the rocks get weathered  okay
""
We saw 
how the components of  act upon the
minerals in the rock and 
composition gets changed 
""
Now we shall see how this rain water acts upon  the rock and
how the rock is weathered because of rain water 
""
Okay the rain water which falls on the earth 
surface  uh it falls and it gets into it also enters the
rock
""
How  ?
""
""
The cracks
""
""
From the cracks of the rock  cracks
 okay
""
So this rain water gets collected  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  when the temperature
falls  what happens ?
""
""
""
""
""
 extreme cool
temperature the water freezes and forms 
""
""
""
""
""
Now ice requires 
""
""
""
""
""
It requires 
""
So what will happen ?
""
When they form ice it requires more places  and so therefore
the rock 
""
The rock has to get expanded  okay
""
The rock expands 
""
""
""
""
""
""
The crack 
""
""
""
""
""
So this is also  this doesn't
happen in  or in a year or two
""
In course of time  ultimately what
happens to those particular rock  ?
""
""
The rock
""
""
It gets  broken up
and 
""
So rain water is another factor 
weathering  which causes weathering
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
Now 
other than  even living beings
 for
example  which makes
burrows 
""
Earthworms  creatures
which live under the 
""
So they in course of time by burrowing the soil and eating up the
 they weather the rock material and these
are also 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
