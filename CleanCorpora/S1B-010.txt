<I>
See children I will be uh talking about weathering
once again okay 
 We'll be talking about weathering 
Now just behave as if you've not learnt this chapter okay
 I'll start with from the beginning 
Now the atmospheric conditions condition 
 is never constant 
It keeps on changing okay
There is always throughout you have rise and fall
of the temperature okay
Now as this rise and fall of the temperature affects 
human being our skin for example you find that in the cold season 
your skin get shrivelled 
It get shrivelled it get cracked
Your lips get cracked 
So they are subject to that the changes in the 
atmosphere okay
The rise and fall in the temperature 
Now similarly this atmospheric condition this rise and fall of the
temperature also affect other components for example the rocks 
Now like how the wear and tear of a skin similarly the
rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear okay
Due to the rise and fall of the temperature the rocks are also
affected 
Now how they are affected ?
 We'll be doing we will I will be discussing
that also shortly 
Now this wear and te tear 
 it's this uh atmospheric ke changes in the
atmosphere a affect the rock and this
rock get soften breaks up into pieces 
So this is known as weathering 
The softening and the breaking up of rocks is termed as
 Tear 
Weathering
Okay
The wear and tear
Like how our skin for example get shrivelled gets cracked 
or even in the hot summer season you find it very dry okay
You find your skin getting very dry
Similarly the rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear 
And this that exist so the rocks been uh they 
are exposed to the atmosphere always 
They are always exposed to the atmosphere 
This wear and tear of the rock the softening and the
breaking up of rock is termed as
Weathering
Okay
So could you repeat the definition weathering
Yes Ranjeet ?
There are uh there are the wear and tear of
 of rocks by the atmosphere upon the rock is called
weathering 
Yes of cou upon uh
So the softening and the breaking up of rock in geographical
term is defined as weathering weathering
 Weathering 
Sit down take your seat okay
Now this weathering can be classified into two types 
okay
Chemical weathering and mechanical weathering 
 Mechanical weathering 
Okay
We classify this weathering into chemical and mechanical
Okay now what is this mechanical weathering ?
That is mechanical weathering is caused because of the
rise that difference in temperature the variations in temperatures 
cause mechanical weathering 
So how does it take place ?
What happens to the rock because of the variations in temperature
 ?
What happens ?
The rock gets expa any ma now rock material 
when heated gets expanded expanded
 Expanded 
Expanded when cooled get contracted contracted
 Contracted 
Okay
So variations in temperature how does it afffect this rock ?
The rocks in the hot summer season gets expanded and when
the temperature falls in the winter season gets contracted 
contracted
 Contracted 
So this expansion and contraction in the for co
 for a long in a course of time what happens ?
The rock become becomes loose 
It gets weathered 
It gets weathered it gets weathered and it starts crumbling 
breaking up into pie breaking up into pie 
small pieces and from the small pieces into gravel from gravel
into very fine particle noise and it becomes ultimately 
sand 
So the sandy nature of the desert is the result of ?
<$CH
 Sand 
Mechanical weathering
 Cough 
Mechanical weathering
So this mechanical weathering is caused because of uh the
variations in temperature 
 Temperature 
And the variations in temperatures are change in atmosphereic
conditions okay
The changes in atmospheric condition
This uhm we'll just recall what is mechanical
weathering complete with this Pavle 
How would you describe mechanical weathering ?
The disintegration of rock
Yes the disintegration of rock right 
Due to what ?
Disintegrate means what ?
Breaking up 
So why how does it break up ?
The change in temperature
The change in temperature
The rise and fall in temperature
Yes in most in detail 
Manasi ?
Teacher dis 
Just elaborate on the topic
Disintegration of the uh rock into the chemical process is
called mechanical weathering
Yes
Due to chemical changes uh 
I am talking of only mechanical weathering
The changes in the physical temperature so that rock
changes weathers it then uh it gets uh
How does it get weathered ?
The small pieces travels and fallen into the tanks when
large pieces
But you haven't explained how does it get weathered ?
How does it get weathered ?
If mechanical weathering is uh result of the variations in
 temperature 
 Temperature 
So how does the variations in temperature affect rock ?
Okay let her answer
Changes in temperature affect rock when the temperature
gets more hot the rock uh expand
The temerature gets more hot or temperature rises
The rock is expanded and when it cools down the rock the rock
also get contracted
Yes
Due to uh this process of rock finally get uh
uh rock finally breaks cough up into pieces 
cough because of more weathering it breaks it to 
 form sand
Yes 
So the sandy nature of uh desert is the result of 
mechanical weathering 
 Mechanical weathering 
Anything more to say ?
Okay okay
So this was what is mechanical weathering 
Now what is chemical weathering ?
Now this rock material contains various minerals present in it
Okay see
 Weathering 
Now this uh in this atmosphere
the various components of atmosphere
What are the various components of atmosphere ?
If you recall your earlier portion done in the lower
classes
What are the various components of atmosphere ?
Water vapour oxygen gases
This water vapour gases nitrogen oxygen
carbondioxide various gases presented present 
in the organ 
Then uh dust particles these are all components of the
atmosphere
Now now these chemical these components like water uh
carbondioxide water vapour they change the chemical composition
of the rock 
 Rock 
And when the chemical composition of the rock is changed 
it is termed as chemical weathering 
 Chemical weathering 
Okay 
So the various other components of the atmosphere like water
vapour uh then carbondioxide nitrogen and the way other uh
these organ dust particles they act upon the rocks 
The chemical composition present in the rocks is changed 
And this is the results do result 
And then this is then subjected to various changes
 even the chemical composition of the rock changes
Again it gets weathered 
And this can be termed as chemical weathering 
So we learnt what is weathering the definition of weathering
That the weathering can be classified into mechanical we have
learnt mechanical and chemical 
 Chemical weathering 
 Chemical 
Mechanical is the result of the variations in
temperature 
 Variations in temperature 
While chemical weathering is the
The chemical composition of the rock is changed
The chemical composition of the rock is changed 
Gets changed because of the action of these components
Components like water-vapour carbondioxide 
etcetera
 Water-vapour carbondioxide 
 Is they act upon the minerals in the rock 
They act upon the components and the minerals of the rock and 
 the the composition of this rock is changed 
So this can be termed as chemical weathering 
 Chemical weathering 
Okay 
Now now we move to uh at now besides the
variations in temperature besides these uh uhm chemical composition
getting changed because of the other components in the atmosphere
There are others also other methods other ways also by
which the rock is weathered okay 
I hope you are familiar with the term weathered now
What do you mean by weathering and what is weathering of the rock
 ?
Okay now various other factors are also there
Now there are various external agents of uh the nature
Okay which act upon the different components in the atmosphere 
okay
Now this external agent can you tell me what are the external
agents of uh nature ?
Yes Raja ?
 One word 
External agents of nature which acts upon the rocks
 Wa wa wa wa water 
Water yes 
Rain water ground water then glacier spring 
Seawave wind 
Yes 
Wind 
Wind seawave yes
They all erode and weathered weather 
the rock particles in the atmosphere okay
Now this rain water the rain water which falls on the
earth surface okay
They go down in the fo they can they are in
 form they join the seas they they
 form rivu rivulet 
They go into the they get percolated into the
 ground and they form ground water 
Other then that the rain water also is the 
responsible for the weathering of rocks 
 Rocks 
How ?
How is the rain water responsible for weathering of rocks ?
We saw how the variations in temperature affect the rock
and how the rocks get weathered okay
We saw how the chemical components of atmos 
how the components of atmosphere are act upon the
minerals in the rock and chem chemical 
composition gets changed and we saw how weathering takes place 
Now we shall see how this rain water acts upon the rock and
how the rock is weathered because of rain water 
Okay the rain water which falls on the earth cough 
surface gets into uh it falls and it gets into it also enters the
rock
How ?
The cracks
From the cracks of the rock they enter the cracks
 cracks of the rock okay
So this rain water gets collected in the crack of a
 the rock 
 Rock 
Now when the temperature falls when the temperature
falls this water doesn't remain as water as well what happens ?
 It freezes 
 It freezes in the extreme cool
temperature the water freezes and forms ice 
 Ice 
Now ice requires more place 
 More place 
It requires more place than water 
So what will happen ?
When they form ice it requires more places and so therefore
the rock is has to get gets expanded 
The rock has to get expanded okay
The rock expands the rock expands and the crack 
 widen 
 Widen 
The crack widen 
 Widen 
So this is also again in course of time this doesn't
happen in a day or two or in a year or two
In course of time in course of time ultimately what
happens to those particular rock ?
The rock
It gets it disintegrated it gets broken up
and they the weathering of rock takes place 
So rain water is another factor which causes 
weathering which causes weathering
 Weathering 
Okay 
Now uh other creature other the other 
other than all this even human beings even living beings
 are responsible for the weathering of rock cough for
example the rat which burrows itself which makes
burrows or digs underground soil to live inside that 
Earthworms there are so many other these creatures
which live under the soil soil okay 
So they in course of time by burrowing the soil and eating up the
 they uh weather the rock they weather the rock material and these
are also one of the uh causes why the rock gets weathered 
 Soil 
 Weathered
