Now today 
""
""
Now already you have studied regarding the consumption topic 
""
There you have studied regarding the behaviour of a 
""
How a consumer is reacting towards the prices in the law of demand
""
""
You have studied that  the quantity
demanded 
increased 
""
Now here  that
how the consumer always tries to maximise his satis
""
Now under the laws of return  we are going to study the behaviour
of a 
""
That how the producer  is trying to find out the relationship
between the input and output  and how this input-output relationship is
""
""
Because his returns depends upon 
""
So under this now  we have to
study  the law of increasing
return diminishing return constant return  and we have also to
study the returns to state 
""
But before we start  law of increasing return
 we have to
be very clear regarding these certain 
""
So the first concept regarding which  we have to be clear that
is the production function 
""
Production function  now you can write on this production
function 
""
According to Professor Lepski  Production function is
 a
technological relation 
showing for given state of technology 
""
This explains 
how much can be produced 
given amount of 
""
 the functional
relationship 
is known as production function  production
function 
""
It can be written in the form of equation  it can be written in
the form of equation 
A B 
""
Here  Q means quantity
 B B work end
""
production 
""
This equation shows 
quantity produced 
respectively 
""
This 
factors 
""
Production function  expresses the
relationship 
between  and quantities
of various inputs  ends to
dictate  written
""
Now in this 
that what is production function  ?
""
It is a type of technological relationship  which is existing
between the input and output
""
Now do you know what is the meaning of input and what is the
meaning of output  ?
""
What is the meaning of input  ?
""
Yes  ?
""
Yes answer me 
""
 a new topic but you must come
forward 
""
Now for the production of commodity what do you need  ?
""
""
Raw materials
""
""
Raw materials so all these raw materials are input 
""
This factors of production  as land labour capital raw materials
all these are the input 
""
Now there supposingly  there are two labourers and they are
producing ten chairs 
""
Now what is the relationship between this  ?
""
Raw material also they are using
""
Along with that now what you will say  ?
""
That making use of all these two labourers they are able to produce
the ten chairs in a day
""
So this is the production function that when we employ the two
labourers 
""
When we employ the third labourer the production function will 
change because they will be producing now 
""
So what is production function ?
""
It is simply  the inputs and outputs
""
""
Input is here the factors of production  or the amount of the
goods which we are using for the production of other commodities  and
output is the commodity which you are able to produce  after making use of
the input 
""
And production function is giving you the relationship between the
input and output 
""
Thereby having this much of factors of production how much
commodity we can  produce
""
So to that we are calling it as a  input and output relationship
""
""
Then further  two things must be
noted 
""
First  with
reference to a particular period of time  production must be considered
""
""
Written  ?
""
Second 
""
Production technology should not  production
technology 
""
Production technology  that
period 
""
Because  when
technology changes  when
technology changes 
ends to dictate 
""
Now these are the two things which we have to keep in mind
regarding the  that it should be related to a
particular period of time and during that period  our technology should
not be changed 
""
Because if the technology will change  then our same production
function relationship will not 
""
Why ?
""
Because with technology advancement when the technology changes 
new input output relation come 
""
So then our that production function cannot exist 
""
So when we are studying it  for a particular period of time
during that period it is essential  that the technology should not change
""
As accordingly firstly the clothes are being produced with the help
of handloom device 
""
Now production was less  some period
new technology has come  cloth with
the help of 
""
So naturally input output relation will  and
production function will also change 
""
Then  two
types of production function are there 
""
In economic theory  two types of production function are there
""
""
First  are
kept constant  and other is
changed 
""
Written  production function will be
available in the short period 
""
Now I had explained to you already the concept of short period 
market period and long period 
""
From the adjustment of the supply point of view 
""
Now can you tell me now what is short period  ?
""
Now again you have to go back
""
""
""
What is short period  ?
""
""
During the short period the supply can be  input to the
""
""
Yes 
""
Short periods are that period in which  ad
 only by
taking the variable factors of production 
""
I told you there are two types of factors of production 
""
Fixed factors of production and  variable factors of production
""
So in the short period we are keeping the fixed factor as  a
 unchanged
""
Because  that in this
production function  some inputs are kept constant and others are changed
""
""
Here fixed factors are kept constant  and variable factors are
changed during the short period  at your
limited extent
""
And in the short period  then a little laws of returns are
applicable as the law of increasing return  diminishing return and
constant returns
""
These laws will be applicable in the short period 
""
Why ?
""
Because in the short period  you are not taking the fixed factor
we are simply taking the  variable factor
""
And when you are taking the variable factor  in the beginning
""
""
Why they start increasing because  earlier you are not making
proper utilisation of the fixed factors of  production
""
Now you want to increase the production and by employing the
variable factor you are able to have the better utilisation of the fixed
factors of  because of this your return have started
increasing 
""
But after some time your result return will start  diminishing
""
Now why they will start diminishing  ?
""
Why ?
""
Because now the variable factors as you are increasing the variable
factors on that thing  your variable factors are becoming more in
proportion to the fixed factors and  they are getting lesser and lesser
shares from the fixed factors to work upon them and because of this  their
return starts diminishing 
""
So you have to keep this thing in mind that this first type of
production function 
""
Now second is 
""
All the factors are changed 
""
So this is the  second production function and it is applicable
in the  long run
""
Because long period you know is that period  where all type of
adjustments are possible 
""
Supply and demand can be adjustable to any extent and all the
factors of production becomes 
""
And under this production function you will be selling the returns
to state 
""
Uh became one of the  difference
""
""
There in the short period  laws of return
""
Here returns to  state because in the second production
function  and
because of the change in the scale of production
""
What is the change in the return  ?
""
That is studied under the returns to state 
""
So this is regarding the  first concept of the production
function 
""
Then your next will be  besides this you must have a idea
regarding the 
product average product and marginal product 
""
Because if you are not clear regarding that also  then also you
cannot understand these laws of return 
""
So first of all we will study the total product 
""
So what that is ?
""
""
Product 
""
""
Now what is the meaning of  ?
""
Although it is not related to you  this but still I want to
connect this topic with that 
""
Total what is the total cost  ?
""
""
""
""
""
I am asking you what is the meaning of total cost  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Don't study at home you 
""
Total cost is the cost of producing a commodity 
""
Whatever total money if a pruducer is spending on the productional
value providing 
""
Okay and it includes fixed and variable from both 
""
Then you have studied the total value cocept also 
""
What is total value  ?
""
It is the money received which is being received by the producer
""
""
Whatever money he is getting to that we are calling it as the
total 
""
Now similarly 
which are being produced  producers labourers
or input whatever we are using
""
By making use of that whatever we are able to produce to that we
are calling it as the total 
""
You can write down the meaning of total product 
""
Be regular otherwise it will be very difficult for you 
Begins to dictate 
""
Total product of a factor is 
is  is the amount of the total output
 given
amount of factors 
""
As the factors are increased  total product also starts rising
""
""
""
Total product also 
""
""
Total product also start rising  but the rate of
increased  at different
levels of output 
""
In the beginning  total product rises
 total
product starts rising  diminishing
rate  the
employment of variable factors  as the employment of
variable factors 
""
Written
""
Now you can take this how you can find out it is increasing 
""
You you can take the number of 
product  how it is
 then it is increasing at a
diminishing rate 
""
Now accordingly then the  zero first labourer is here the total
product is n unit 
""
The second labourer is employed the total product is  eighteen
units 
""
The third 
the fourth 
""
And fifth labourer it is thirty-two 
""
Now what did you come to know from this  ?
""
It is first of all it is increasing at a increasing rate or not
 ?
""
Than it is increasing at a 
""
Than from the first labourer  you have employed the second
labourer the total product has increased from ten to eighteen  there has
been the increase of eight units 
""
In the third case also it is not as if there is an increase of the
 seven units
""
Now in fourth case you see 
five units
""
So the rate of increase is 
""
Then in the fifth case you find there is increase of only the 
two units 
""
Why it is happening this  ?
""
Because now when the first labourer was there the fixed factors
were more 
""
When we start with second labourer  there was a better
utilisation of both factors of production and the production has increased
""
""
When we employ the third then also it has increased 
""
But after the  when we have
employed the fifth labourer the rate of increase  in the total product is
 diminishing
""
It is diminishing because as the variable factors are increased
""
""
Now these fixed factors you work upon them and because of this 
their total products starts  diminishing
""
Okay 
""
Is that okay
