<I>
Now today we are going to start the new topic 
 The laws of return laws of return 
Now already you have studied regarding the consumption topic 
There you have studied regarding the behaviour of a consumer 
How a consumer is reacting towards the prices in the law of demand
You have studied that when the price increases the quantity
demanded decreases and when price fall the quantity demand is 
increased 
Now here you have studied the behaviour of a consumer that
how the consumer always tries to maximise his satisfaction 
Now under the laws of return we are going to study the behaviour
of a producer 
That how the producer is trying to find out the relationship
between the input and output and how this input-output relationship is
 useful for determining his cost of production 
Because his returns depends upon the cost of production 
So under this now laws of return we have to
study three different types of laws the law of increasing
return diminishing return constant return and we have also to
study the returns to state 
But before we start with the law of increasing return
 or law of variable proportion we have to
be very clear regarding these certain concepts 
So the first concept regarding which we have to be clear that
is the production function production function 
Production function now you can write on this production
function Begins to dictate 
According to Professor Lepski Production function is
 production function is a technological relation is a
technological relation showing for given state of technology 
showing for given state of technology cough 
This explains cough how much can be produced 
how much can be produced with given amount of input with 
given amount of input 
 The functional relationship the functional
relationship with the physical input and physical output 
is known as production function is known as production
function ends to dictate 
It can be written in the form of equation it can be written in
the form of equation as Quantity is equal to F 
A B C D quantity equal to F A B C D 
Here quantity B B work begin Q means quantity
 F means factors of production A B C D B B work end
 different factors of production A B C D different factors of 
production Begins to dictates 
This equation shows cough this equation shows 
quantity produced depends on factors of production 
respectively 
This equation shows quantity produced depends on 
factors of production respectively 
Production function production function expresses the
relationship production function expresses the relationship 
between quantity of output quantity of output and quantities
of various inputs and quantities of various inputs ends to
dictate written
Now in this production function what do you come to know 
that what is production function ?
It is a type of technological relationship which is existing
between the input and output
Now do you know what is the meaning of input and what is the
meaning of output ?
What is the meaning of input ?
Yes ?
Yes answer me 
 It's alright it's a new topic but you must come
forward 
Now for the production of commodity what do you need ?
Raw materials
Raw materials so all these raw materials are input 
This factors of production as land labour capital raw materials
all these are the input 
Now there supposingly there are two labourers and they are
producing ten chairs 
Now what is the relationship between this ?
Raw material also they are using
Along with that now what you will say ?
That making use of all these two labourers they are able to produce
the ten chairs in a day
So this is the production function that when we employ the two
labourers they are producing ten chairs 
When we employ the third labourer the production function will 
change because they will be producing now more number of chairs 
So what is production function ?
It is simply a relationship between the inputs and outputs
Input is here the factors of production or the amount of the
goods which we are using for the production of other commodities and
output is the commodity which you are able to produce after making use of
the input 
And production function is giving you the relationship between the
input and output 
Thereby having this much of factors of production how much
commodity we can produce
So to that we are calling it as a input and output relationship
 Begins to dictate 
Then further two things must be noted two things must be
noted in respect of in respect of production function 
First production must be considered with
reference to a particular period of time production must be considered
 with reference to particular period of time 
Written ?
Second 
Production technology should not change production
technology should not change during that period 
Production technology should not change during that
period 
Because when technology changes because when
technology changes production function also gets changed when
technology changes production function also gets changed 
ends to dictate 
Now these are the two things which we have to keep in mind
regarding the production function that it should be related to a
particular period of time and during that period our technology should
not be changed 
Because if the technology will change then our same production
function relationship will not be there 
Why ?
Because with technology advancement when the technology changes 
new input output relation come 
So then our that production function cannot exist 
So when we are studying it for a particular period of time
during that period it is essential that the technology should not change
As accordingly firstly the clothes are being produced with the help
of handloom device 
Now production was less and after that some period
new technology has come and now we may start producing the cloth with
the help of powerloom you can say 
So naturally input output relation will change and
production function will also change 
Then Begins to dictate in economic theory two
types of production function are there 
In economic theory two types of production function are there
First when some input when some input are
kept constant when some input are kept constant and other is
changed and other are changed ends to dictate 
Written now this type of production function will be
available in the short period 
Now I had explained to you already the concept of short period 
market period and long period 
From the adjustment of the supply point of view 
Now can you tell me now what is short period ?
Now again you have to go back
 It's very bad 
What is short period ?
During the short period the supply can be input to the
Yes 
Short periods are that period in which we can ad
 adjust the supply to a limited absence only by
taking the variable factors of production 
I told you there are two types of factors of production 
Fixed factors of production and variable factors of production
So in the short period we are keeping the fixed factor as a
 unchanged
Because now just now you have written that in this
production function some inputs are kept constant and others are changed
Here fixed factors are kept constant and variable factors are
changed during the short period and supply is at the dip at your
limited extent
And in the short period then a little laws of returns are
applicable as the law of increasing return diminishing return and
constant returns
These laws will be applicable in the short period 
Why ?
Because in the short period you are not taking the fixed factor
we are simply taking the variable factor
And when you are taking the variable factor in the beginning
 then the returns starts increasing 
Why they start increasing because earlier you are not making
proper utilisation of the fixed factors of production
Now you want to increase the production and by employing the
variable factor you are able to have the better utilisation of the fixed
factors of production because of this your return have started
increasing 
But after some time your result return will start diminishing
Now why they will start diminishing ?
Why ?
Because now the variable factors as you are increasing the variable
factors on that thing your variable factors are becoming more in
proportion to the fixed factors and they are getting lesser and lesser
shares from the fixed factors to work upon them and because of this their
return starts diminishing 
So you have to keep this thing in mind that this first type of
production function is applicable in the short period 
Now second is there all the inputs can be changed 
All the factors are changed all the factors are changed 
So this is the second production function and it is applicable
in the long run
Because long period you know is that period where all type of
adjustments are possible 
Supply and demand can be adjustable to any extent and all the
factors of production becomes variable 
And under this production function you will be selling the returns
to state 
Uh became one of the diff diff difference
 coming between them 
There in the short period laws of return
Here returns to state because in the second production
function you are totaly changing the scale of the production and
because of the change in the scale of production
What is the change in the return ?
That is studied under the returns to state 
So this is regarding the first concept of the production
function 
Then your next will be besides this you must have a idea
regarding the tot meaning of total 
product average product and marginal product 
Because if you are not clear regarding that also then also you
cannot understand these laws of return 
So first of all we will study the total product 
So what that is ?
Product 
Now what is the meaning of total cost ?
Although it is not related to you this but still I want to
connect this topic with that 
Total what is the total cost ?
 A few words 
I am asking you what is the meaning of total cost ?
 A few words 
Don't study at home you one word 
Total cost is the cost of producing a commodity 
Whatever total money if a pruducer is spending on the productional
value providing is known as the total cost 
Okay and it includes fixed and variable from both 
Then you have studied the total value cocept also 
What is total value ?
It is the money received which is being received by the producer
 while selling up certain amount of commodity in the market 
Whatever money he is getting to that we are calling it as the
total value 
Now similarly the total product is the amount of the goods 
which are being produced by a certain number of producers labourers
or input whatever we are using
By making use of that whatever we are able to produce to that we
are calling it as the total product 
You can write down the meaning of total product 
Be regular otherwise it will be very difficult for you 
Begins to dictate 
Total product of a factor is total product of a factor 
is the amount of the total output is the amount of the total output
 produced by given amount of factors produced by given
amount of factors given amount of factors 
As the factors are increased total product also starts rising
Total product also 
Total product also start rising but the rate of
increased value but the rate of increased value at different
levels of output at different levels of output 
In the beginning in the beginning total product rises
 at a increasing rate after a point after a point total
product starts rising total product start rising at diminishing
rate as the employment of variable factors as the
employment of variable factors increases as the employment of
variable factors increases ends to dictate 
Written
Now you can take this how you can find out it is increasing 
You you can take the number of labourers and total 
product and total product from which you can come to know how it is
 firstly increasing at an increasing rate then it is increasing at a
diminishing rate 
Now accordingly then the zero first labourer is here the total
product is n unit 
The second labourer is employed the total product is eighteen
units 
The third labourer is employed it is twenty-five 
the fourth it is thirty and fifth it is thirty-two 
And fifth labourer it is thirty-two 
Now what did you come to know from this ?
It is first of all it is increasing at a increasing rate or not
 ?
Than it is increasing at a diminishing rate 
Than from the first labourer you have employed the second
labourer the total product has increased from ten to eighteen there has
been the increase of eight units 
In the third case also it is not as if there is an increase of the
 seven units
Now in fourth case you see there is the increase of only 
five units
So the rate of increase is decreasing 
Then in the fifth case you find there is increase of only the 
two units 
Why it is happening this ?
Because now when the first labourer was there the fixed factors
were more and they were not being fully utilised 
When we start with second labourer there was a better
utilisation of both factors of production and the production has increased
When we employ the third then also it has increased 
But after the fourth labourer we find when we have
employed the fifth labourer the rate of increase in the total product is
 diminishing
It is diminishing because as the variable factors are increased
 they are getting lesser and lesser shares 
Now these fixed factors you work upon them and because of this 
their total products starts diminishing
Okay 
Is that okay
