Now today 
""
""
Now already you have studied regarding the consumption topic 
""
There you have studied regarding the behaviour of a 
""
""
""
""
You have studied that  the quantity
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So under this now  we have to
""
""
study the returns to state 
""
But before we start  law of increasing return
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
relationship 
""
function 
""
""
""
A B 
""
Here  Q means quantity
 B B work end
""
production 
""
""
quantity produced 
respectively 
""
This 
factors 
""
Production function  expresses the
""
between  and quantities
of various inputs  ends to
""
""
""
""
""
It is a type of technological relationship  which is existing
""
""
Now do you know what is the meaning of input and what is the
""
""
What is the meaning of input  ?
""
""
""
""
""
 a new topic but you must come
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
all these are the input 
""
""
producing ten chairs 
""
Now what is the relationship between this  ?
""
Raw material also they are using
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So what is production function ?
""
""
""
""
""
goods which we are using for the production of other commodities  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
commodity we can  produce
""
So to that we are calling it as a  input and output relationship
""
""
Then further  two things must be
""
""
""
reference to a particular period of time  production must be considered
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
period 
""
Because  when
""
""
""
""
""
regarding the  that it should be related to a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So then our that production function cannot exist 
""
So when we are studying it  for a particular period of time
""
""
As accordingly firstly the clothes are being produced with the help
""
""
""
""
the help of 
""
""
""
""
""
types of production function are there 
""
""
""
""
""
kept constant  and other is
""
""
""
""
""
Now I had explained to you already the concept of short period 
market period and long period 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
taking the variable factors of production 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because  that in this
production function  some inputs are kept constant and others are changed
""
""
""
""
""
""
And in the short period  then a little laws of returns are
""
constant returns
""
""
""
""
""
Because in the short period  you are not taking the fixed factor
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
increasing 
""
""
""
""
""
Why ?
""
Because now the variable factors as you are increasing the variable
factors on that thing  your variable factors are becoming more in
""
shares from the fixed factors to work upon them and because of this  their
""
""
So you have to keep this thing in mind that this first type of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
factors of production becomes 
""
""
to state 
""
Uh became one of the  difference
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
function 
""
""
regarding the 
product average product and marginal product 
""
""
cannot understand these laws of return 
""
""
""
So what that is ?
""
""
Product 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
value providing 
""
Okay and it includes fixed and variable from both 
""
Then you have studied the total value cocept also 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now similarly 
""
or input whatever we are using
""
By making use of that whatever we are able to produce to that we
""
""
""
""
""
Begins to dictate 
""
Total product of a factor is 
is  is the amount of the total output
""
amount of factors 
""
As the factors are increased  total product also starts rising
""
""
""
Total product also 
""
""
Total product also start rising  but the rate of
increased  at different
""
""
""
 total
""
""
employment of variable factors  as the employment of
""
""
""
""
Now you can take this how you can find out it is increasing 
""
You you can take the number of 
""
 then it is increasing at a
""
""
""
product is n unit 
""
The second labourer is employed the total product is  eighteen
units 
""
The third 
""
""
And fifth labourer it is thirty-two 
""
Now what did you come to know from this  ?
""
""
 ?
""
Than it is increasing at a 
""
""
""
""
""
In the third case also it is not as if there is an increase of the
""
""
Now in fourth case you see 
""
""
So the rate of increase is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because now when the first labourer was there the fixed factors
""
""
When we start with second labourer  there was a better
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
their total products starts  diminishing
""
""
""
Is that okay
