Another budget 
""
The Railway budget for next year  has proposed a ten percent
increase 
""
The railways of course 
that 
""
And despite the fact  to improve
their productivity over last year  an increase has
become necessary 
""
And unless they do this  they will not be able to maintain their
""
""
Not many of course 
""
There would be usual criticism  that the great hike will be
inflationary 
""
The cost of production will go up 
""
There will be more burden on the consumer  as prices of essential
commodities will go up 
""
And of course 
at least ten percent more 
""
The budget of course 
the hike is justified  ?
""
Whether the railways can actually  the the
 ?
""
Can they accomodate by improving their effeciency  ?
""
Are they using their resources efficiently  ?
""
Are they deploying 
which  and the country at
large  ?
""
Are the railways investing enough  to take care of the growing
needs of the economy  ?
""
These and  in
this discussion today 
""
We have a distinguished panel 
""
And on my right  of the railway board
""
""
On 
Mr K N Thakur  advisor
""
who is the financial commission for the railways 
""
Uh Mr Shukla  begin this
discussion with you 
""
 the rate of
inflation 
""
How do you actually justify  ?
""
Particularly freight rate because last year  when the rate of
price rise was much higher  rate by seven point
five percent 
""
This year when the rate of inflation has come down  the freight
has gone up by ten percent 
""
Surely your input cost  must have gone up by a
much lower percentage 
""
Then how do you explain it  ?
""
""
Mr Bharati 
been met 
""
One is  which the railways have been
getting from the government 
""
And the other is internal resource generation 
""
Over the last four or five years we have added a third force 
and that is  of the Indian Railway Finance
Corporation 
""
So basically these are the three sources that we have available to
us 
""
Now you might be aware of the fact that the budgetory support 
in the fifth five year plan  was of the order of seventy-five percent
""
""
This slowly went down to about sixty percent  in the sixth plan
""
""
And it has been steadly diminishing 
""
We did come up with this  new source that is the railway bond
""
""
But unfortunately  the
unusual market conditions which have prevailed  over the last one year or
so 
""
It was not being possible to sell these bonds  although we have
increased the the  uh the interest rate of the bond from nine percent that
which we used to sell them earlier to ten and a half percent 
""
But there are just  to this particular movement
""
""
Therefore  it was
uh thirty-four percent in ninety-two ninety-three 
""
And it is going to fall to just fourteen point seven percent in
ninety-three ninety-four 
""
We have no option 
""
But  to raise internal resources if we are going to provide the
necessary infrastructure  the
industry of the country as a whole to develop 
""
There are no soft option 
""
""
Mr Shukla you are you are suggesting that  uh indirectly
suggesting that 
is more linked to the fact 
rather 
""
Are you saying that there is no link between the cost of operations
and the rate in passenger fare increased  ?
""
""
No there is a direct link 
""
And  of how our
input cost have gone up 
""
That is in this this very financial year 
""
The 
has been up 
""
The electric tariff that  has gone up
as much as sixteen percent 
""
And staff cost  of
the staff salary has gone up by twenty percent 
""
And of course we have to make the usual three percent provision for
increments 
""
Now if you add all this together 
""
And add to it the fact that we are planning to 
the traffic output  by
something like six percent 
""
It would amount to an additional requirement of funds  of the
order of something like sixteen to seventeen percent really 
""
Now if you give a look at the figures 
year's  and the proposed ordinary working
expenses for ninety-three ninety-four  find that there is
just a thirteen percent increase 
""
Which means that we have a short  some three to four percent
 by cost cutting
 and by various means
""
There is another efficiency factor which I would like to mention at
this very point of time 
""
The operating the issue of  divided by
the income 
""
In ninety ninety-one  and
ninety-one ninety-two it came down to eighty-nine point five percent 
""
In ninety-two ninety-three  to get eighty-seven
percent though we had budgeted for eighty-seven point seven percent 
""
And our planning for ninety-three ninety-four is going to be 
eighty-three percent 
""
So it is a combination of  cost cutting and resource
mobilization 
need 
""
""
 would
you  buy this argument that the railways have done enough to
""
""
Uh the economic survey  this year
 in the railways is
very low 
""
And considering that  it accounts for over fifty percent of
their cost of operation 
""
Do you think there is hope for making more improvements and
containing 
""
""
I think Mr Bharati  the fundamental question is what Mr
Shukla was mentioning 
""
This particular  to my perception marks a
water-shed  role of the state is concerned in the
development of the infrastructure 
""
It also marks  so far as the pricing policy is
concerned 
""
It appears that the state has  for the
development of 
""
The figures which Mr Shukla mentioned 
which is very important 
what was funded by the state 
""
""
This raises the basic issue  whether the distortions in the
past  will be
able to absorb that 
""
""
 separate these two
issues 
""
I mean on the one hand you can emphasis the  let us say the
extra budgetary constraint on the railways  that is the role of the state
""
""
And 
""
""
Now coming to the efficiency  it
appears that the rate 
but the productivity percent has not been increasing to mention it 
""
There is a scope for the improvement 
""
There is always the scope for the improvement in what manner it
will take place over there that is 
""
""
""
""
""
 could you give some specific
suggestion 
""
""
The railways have to make sure that the technological 
upgradation 
""
Unfortunately  all along concentrated on
 we send around the
teams
""
We  we have a laborous process of uh acquisition of technology
""
""
Now the technology cycle are shrinking all over the world 
""
By the time we wake up to 
it's 
""
""
But  uh you know the fact that you are linking efficiency
with modernization 
""
You cannot modernize unless you get more resources
""
The railways will turn around and say okay we have to raise the
passsenger price  and we have to raise freight price if we want us to
modernize 
""
""
 I started at the begining Mr Bharti that
when I mentioned that the state seems to be 
of development of infrastructure
""
""
You mean the railway 
""
""
""
""
""
It is a question of state  participating in the developmental
activities 
""
After all the railways are there  to serve the national purpose
""
""
We also know that there are historical distortions for instance 
the uni gauge which  talking of it is a multigauge of the past
""
""
We also know that the railway system was developed  basically in
the  for the export of the
goods by the Britishers from the ports 
""
If you see the sweep of the railway net-hold it is largely oriented
towards the ports 
""
There are no connectors in between 
""
Now  at the same time the railways have a dilemma they are
passing through a phase of technological change 
""
 changing from steam to diesel diesel to electric
""
""
Now 
say that they are withdrawing themselves 
totally at the mercy of the organization itself to fend 
""
And 
""
And the important thing is 
effect of the  a
very important point
""
And I think we need  be able to talk about it the
impact of that 
""
""
What is the the railways point of view  ?
""
Would they like to eliminate all this subsidies  ?
""
Would they argue that  centre should bear all the
subsidies  ?
""
How is it affecting their cost of operation  ?
""
How is it hindering their ability to contain the increase in 
uh trade and passenger fare  ?
""
""
You see it is in this context  we have been
able to persue  to agree to uh withdrawing subsidies
 on which we have been traditionally giving
subsidies for the last several years 
""
There were  sixteen commodities in which the
subsidies were being given 
""
And this year we are withdrawing the subsidies on four such
commodities 
""
I think that as Mr Thapar just said  various means
can be found 
we will have no option 
and to plan to generating funds on our own 
""
Of course it is very correctly said that our efficiency factors
have to be looked at very closely 
""
We are looking at them very firstly 
""
We are trying to improve the effiiciency
""
I will give you one example  of man power
 which was at around two hundred and
forty-four traffic unit per employee in eighty eighty-one  today stands at
three hundred and sixty-seven  traffic units per employees
""
That is just one of the efficiency indicated and this is the
result  to upgrade the quality of the man power
 increase the proportion of the
output versus the input 
""
Likewise that it is a fact that equipments arrears  have been a
major work  as we would
have like to achieve 
""
And we are tackling this  on a on a I would say on a mission
basis 
""
""
Could you could you tell our  viewers that what would be
the impact on the price of essentials  uh as a result of the withdrawl of
these subsidies  ?
""
Because you have withdrawn subsidies  on uh essential items
like food grains pulses sugar  uh what should be the price infact
""
""
It has these measures  it is it is not as
""
""
Why should the common man have to pay more for these
""
""
I 
""
For a litre of kerosene oil 
have to pay three point to seven paisa more per litre
""
That 
""
For uh  and
twelve 
""
For uh  three point three
seven 
""
Uh tea 
""
The the the heaviest impose has been  on sugar which is
twenty-one 
""
Now that is the order of impact that this is going to have 
""
""
But isn't 
pretty substantial 
""
Anything that rate should be a very more element per kilogram 
""
""
""
""
""
No but the fact is  that sugar has been very heavily
subsidised in terms of transport 
""
Whereas I do not think that who is good as far as the total
compensation is concerned to the consumer 
""
And I do not think that the railway should be called upon  to
bear more than their share 
""
We have been bearing our share 
""
""
What is the 
against uh compensating for these subsidies  ?
""
""
No in fact the centre  the centre is looking at it very
closely 
""
And  that is the discussion which we
have had with the centre  there might be a certain amount of relief
forthcoming  for some of these essential commodities
""
But that we have to wait and see as to  what they are able to
do for us 
""
""
Mr Anand don't you think that 
""
You see we have 
""
You increase frieght rates  that pushes up the price of steel
and coal 
""
And prices 
you're 
""
And this keeps on happening year after year 
""
And we have actually witness them in last two  in last two
years  that when
one price is increased everything else goes up  and a chain reaction
follow 
""
So don't you think by actually pushing up your freight rate by ten
percent  ?
""
 could you not have made some effort to really
restrain these price increase  ?
""
""
Actually the freight increase contribute very little to the
price rise
