Another budget another hike 
The Railway budget for next year has proposed a ten percent
increase in both passenger fares and freight rate 
The railways of course justify this increase on the ground 
that their input cost in the last one year have gone up 
And despite the fact and despite their efforts to improve
their productivity over last year they contend that an increase has
become necessary 
And unless they do this they will not be able to maintain their
 operations as also provide resources for fresh investment 
Not many of course would share this perception 
There would be usual criticism that the great hike will be
inflationary 
The cost of production will go up 
There will be more burden on the consumer as prices of essential
commodities will go up 
And of course the rail traveller would have to shell out 
at least ten percent more for travelling 
The budget of course raises a number of issues whether 
the hike is justified ?
Whether the railways can actually reduce the the
 that prices in tariff ?
Can they accomodate by improving their effeciency ?
Are they using their resources efficiently ?
Are they deploying deploying their funds in the manner 
which suits the priorities of the railway and the country at
large ?
Are the railways investing enough to take care of the growing
needs of the economy ?
These and similar related issues we will look at in
this discussion today 
We have a distinguished panel 
And on my right is member traffic of the railway board
 Mr Shrivasan Mr A N Shukla chairman railway board 
On my le on my left is 
Mr K N Thakur former secretary planning commission and advisor
 a principal advisor to the planning commission and Mr P S Anand 
who is the financial commission for the railways 
Uh Mr Shukla may I may I begin this
discussion with you 
 That considering the fact that the rate of
inflation in the last one year has gone down 
How do you actually justify the increase in freight rate ?
Particularly freight rate because last year when the rate of
price rise was much higher you had increased rate by seven point
five percent 
This year when the rate of inflation has come down the freight
has gone up by ten percent 
Surely your input cost the must have gone up by a
much lower percentage 
Then how do you explain it ?
Mr Bharati the railway finances have traditionally 
been met from two basic sources 
One is the budgetory support which the railways have been
getting from the government 
And the other is internal resource generation 
Over the last four or five years we have added a third force 
and that is the uh sail of bond of the Indian Railway Finance
Corporation 
So basically these are the three sources that we have available to
us 
Now you might be aware of the fact that the budgetory support 
in the fifth five year plan was of the order of seventy-five percent
This slowly went down to about sixty percent in the sixth plan
And it has been steadly diminishing 
We did come up with this new source that is the railway bond
But unfortunately because of the you know the the
unusual market conditions which have prevailed over the last one year or
so 
It was not being possible to sell these bonds although we have
increased the the uh the interest rate of the bond from nine percent that
which we used to sell them earlier to ten and a half percent 
But there are just one word to this particular movement
Therefore when the budgetory support is diminishing it was
uh thirty-four percent in ninety-two ninety-three 
And it is going to fall to just fourteen point seven percent in
ninety-three ninety-four 
We have no option 
But to raise internal resources if we are going to provide the
necessary infrastructure for transport for the country the
industry of the country as a whole to develop 
There are no soft option 
Mr Shukla you are you are suggesting that uh indirectly
suggesting that uh the increase in freight rate and passenger fares 
is more linked to the fact that budgetory support has gone down 
rather rather than to the fact that your input cost has gone up 
Are you saying that there is no link between the cost of operations
and the rate in passenger fare increased ?
No there is a direct link 
And I'll give you a very brief account of how our
input cost have gone up over the last one year 
That is in this this very financial year 
The general increase in prices for materials and fuel 
has been up the other for ten percent 
The electric tariff that we've been paying has gone up
as much as sixteen percent 
And staff cost that the DA uh uh the DA component of
the staff salary has gone up by twenty percent 
And of course we have to make the usual three percent provision for
increments 
Now if you add all this together 
And add to it the fact that we are planning to to increase 
the traffic output both in terms of passengers as well as goods by
something like six percent 
It would amount to an additional requirement of funds of the
order of something like sixteen to seventeen percent really 
Now if you give a look at the figures last this this 
year's already working expenses and the proposed ordinary working
expenses for ninety-three ninety-four you'll find that there is
just a thirteen percent increase 
Which means that we have a short some three to four percent
 of the additional cost by higher productivity by cost cutting
 and by various means
There is another efficiency factor which I would like to mention at
this very point of time that is the operating issue 
The operating the issue of the the input cost divided by
the income 
In ninety ninety-one this was ninety-two percent and
ninety-one ninety-two it came down to eighty-nine point five percent 
In ninety-two ninety-three we expect to get eighty-seven
percent though we had budgeted for eighty-seven point seven percent 
And our planning for ninety-three ninety-four is going to be 
eighty-three percent 
So it is a combination of cost cutting and resource
mobilization whereby we intend to generate the funds that we'll 
need for investing into the transport infrastructure 
 Mm Mm Mr Thapar would
you do you buy this argument that the railways have done enough to
 cut down their cost 
Uh the economic survey of for this year
 in fact mentioned that labour productivity in the railways is
very low 
And considering that it accounts for over fifty percent of
their cost of operation 
Do you think there is hope for making more improvements and
containing the increase in trade and passenger hike 
I think Mr Bharati the fundamental question is what Mr
Shukla was mentioning 
This particular budget to my perception marks a
water-shed so far as the role of the state is concerned in the
development of the infrastructure 
It also marks a water-shed so far as the pricing policy is
concerned 
It appears that the state has forsaken its role for the
development of transport infrastructure and that of the railways 
The figures which Mr Shukla mentioned they tell a story 
which is very important and which gives a message that hitherto 
what was funded by the state will now has have 
 to be funded by an organization 
This raises the basic issue whether the distortions in the
past whether the railways as an instrument of the government will be
able to absorb that and at what cost 
 Can we can we separate these two
issues 
I mean on the one hand you can emphasis the let us say the
extra budgetary constraint on the railways that is the role of the state
 and the link of the central budget and the railway budget 
And second the equally important point of efficiency 
Now coming to the efficiency uhm uh it
appears that the rate that the transport output has been increasing 
but the productivity percent has not been increasing to mention it 
There is a scope for the improvement 
There is always the scope for the improvement in what manner it
will take place over there that is one or two words 
 Uhm 
 Could you could you give some specific
suggestion 
The railways have to make sure that the technological 
upgradation the pace of upgradation has to be accelerated 
Unfortunately we have hithereto all along concentrated on
 uh calling a particular path and that is we send around the
teams
We we have a laborous process of uh acquisition of technology
Now the technology cycle are shrinking all over the world 
By the time we wake up to take up a particular equipment 
it's quite likely it has become an one word 
But uh you know the fact that you are linking efficiency
with modernization it actually poses a dilemma 
You cannot modernize unless you get more resources
The railways will turn around and say okay we have to raise the
passsenger price and we have to raise freight price if we want us to
modernize 
 One word I started at the begining Mr Bharti that
when I mentioned that the state seems to be observing its role 
of development of infrastructure
You mean the railway should be continu 
 should continue to be subsidised by the central budget 
 It's not a question of subsidise 
It is a question of state participating in the developmental
activities 
After all the railways are there to serve the national purpose
We also know that there are historical distortions for instance 
the uni gauge which we're talking of it is a multigauge of the past
 which was built over there 
We also know that the railway system was developed basically in
the uh uh pre-nineteen forty-seven period for the export of the
goods by the Britishers from the ports 
If you see the sweep of the railway net-hold it is largely oriented
towards the ports 
There are no connectors in between 
Now at the same time the railways have a dilemma they are
passing through a phase of technological change 
 You're changing from steam to diesel diesel to electric
Now in this particular period if the state can 
say that they are withdrawing themselves and leaving it to the 
totally at the mercy of the organization itself to fend 
And I'm afraid it will be very short sighted policy 
And the important thing is what will be the one word 
effect of the of this policy on the organization that's a
very important point
And I think we need to be able to talk about it the
impact of that 
What is the the railways point of view ?
Would they like to eliminate all this subsidies ?
Would they argue that the centre should bear all the
subsidies ?
How is it affecting their cost of operation ?
How is it hindering their ability to contain the increase in 
uh trade and passenger fare ?
You see it is in this context that uh we have been
able to persue the government to agree to uh withdrawing subsidies
 on some of the commodities on which we have been traditionally giving
subsidies for the last several years 
There were there was sixteen commodities in which the
subsidies were being given 
And this year we are withdrawing the subsidies on four such
commodities 
I think that as Mr Thapar just said unless various means
can be found to centrally fund the development of the railways 
we will have no option but to resort to reducing the subsidies 
and to plan to generating funds on our own 
Of course it is very correctly said that our efficiency factors
have to be looked at very closely 
We are looking at them very firstly 
We are trying to improve the effiiciency
I will give you one example our productivity of man power
 in terms of one word which was at around two hundred and
forty-four traffic unit per employee in eighty eighty-one today stands at
three hundred and sixty-seven traffic units per employees
That is just one of the efficiency indicated and this is the
result of continuous efforts to upgrade the quality of the man power
 and to to to to increase the proportion of the
output versus the input 
Likewise that it is a fact that equipments arrears have been a
major work of our not being able to achieve as much as we would
have like to achieve 
And we are tackling this on a on a I would say on a mission
basis 
Could you could you tell our viewers that what would be
the impact on the price of essentials uh as a result of the withdrawl of
these subsidies ?
Because you have withdrawn subsidies on uh essential items
like food grains pulses sugar oil uh what should be the price infact
It has these measures it is it is not as
Why should the common man have to pay more for these
I I'll give you a few examples 
For a litre of kerosene oil for for a litre he'll 
have to pay three point to seven paisa more per litre
That that's total impact 
For uh cement it is two rupees and
twelve paisa per sack of fifty kilogram pack 
For uh coal the increase is three three point three
seven paisa per kilogram 
Uh tea eleven paisa per kilogram 
The the the heaviest impose has been on sugar which is
twenty-one paisa per kilogram 
Now that is the order of impact that this is going to have 
But isn't twenty one paisa 
pretty substantial 
Anything that rate should be a very more element per kilogram 
 On 
No but the fact is that sugar has been very heavily
subsidised in terms of transport 
Whereas I do not think that who is good as far as the total
compensation is concerned to the consumer 
And I do not think that the railway should be called upon to
bear more than their share of subsidising the product 
We have been bearing our share 
What is the what is the centre's argument 
against uh compensating for these subsidies ?
No in fact the centre the centre is looking at it very
closely 
And I'm hoping that that is the discussion which we
have had with the centre there might be a certain amount of relief
forthcoming for some of these essential commodities
But that we have to wait and see as to what they are able to
do for us 
Mr Anand don't you think that 
You see we have we have got caught in very vicious circle 
You increase frieght rates that pushes up the price of steel
and coal and petroleum 
And prices when prices of these goods go up you have 
you're compel to increase uh your prices of weight 
And this keeps on happening year after year 
And we have actually witness them in last two in last two
years this inter linkage between administered prices that when
one price is increased everything else goes up and a chain reaction
follow 
So don't you think by actually pushing up your freight rate by ten
percent you are not harming the cause of the economy ?
 That could you not have made some effort to really
restrain these price increase ?
Actually the freight increase contribute very little to the
price rise
