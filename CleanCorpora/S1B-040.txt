Another budget 
""
""
increase 
""
The railways of course 
""
""
And despite the fact  to improve
""
become necessary 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
commodities will go up 
""
""
at least ten percent more 
""
""
the hike is justified  ?
""
Whether the railways can actually  the the
""
""
Can they accomodate by improving their effeciency  ?
""
""
""
""
""
large  ?

On 
Mr K N Thakur  advisor
""
""
""
Uh Mr Shukla  begin this
discussion with you 
""
""
inflation 
""
""
""
Particularly freight rate because last year  when the rate of
""
five percent 
""
""
has gone up by ten percent 
""
Surely your input cost  must have gone up by a
much lower percentage 
""
""
""
""
""
been met 
""
""
getting from the government 
""
""
""
Over the last four or five years we have added a third force 
""
Corporation 
""
""
us 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
unusual market conditions which have prevailed  over the last one year or
so 
""
""
increased the the  uh the interest rate of the bond from nine percent that
which we used to sell them earlier to ten and a half percent 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and the rate in passenger fare increased  ?
""
""
""
""
And  of how our
""
""
""
""
""
has been up 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
increments 
""
Now if you add all this together 
""
""
""
""
""
It would amount to an additional requirement of funds  of the
""
""
Now if you give a look at the figures 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There is another efficiency factor which I would like to mention at
""
""
""
""
""
""
ninety-one ninety-two it came down to eighty-nine point five percent 
""
""
percent though we had budgeted for eighty-seven point seven percent 
""
""
""
""
""
mobilization 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And considering that  it accounts for over fifty percent of
their cost of operation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This particular  to my perception marks a
""
""
""
""
concerned 
""
""
development of 
""
""
which is very important 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 separate these two
issues 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now coming to the efficiency  it
""
""
""
""
""
There is always the scope for the improvement in what manner it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
upgradation 
""
""
""
""
""
We  we have a laborous process of uh acquisition of technology
""
""
Now the technology cycle are shrinking all over the world 
""
By the time we wake up to 
""
""
""
""
with modernization 
""
You cannot modernize unless you get more resources
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
when I mentioned that the state seems to be 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the uni gauge which  talking of it is a multigauge of the past
""
""
""
the  for the export of the
""
""
If you see the sweep of the railway net-hold it is largely oriented
towards the ports 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 changing from steam to diesel diesel to electric
""
""
Now 
""
totally at the mercy of the organization itself to fend 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
impact of that 
""
""
""
""
Would they like to eliminate all this subsidies  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You see it is in this context  we have been
""
 on which we have been traditionally giving
""
""
There were  sixteen commodities in which the
""
""
And this year we are withdrawing the subsidies on four such
""
""
""
can be found 
""
and to plan to generating funds on our own 
""
Of course it is very correctly said that our efficiency factors
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 which was at around two hundred and
forty-four traffic unit per employee in eighty eighty-one  today stands at
""
""
That is just one of the efficiency indicated and this is the
result  to upgrade the quality of the man power
""
output versus the input 
""
Likewise that it is a fact that equipments arrears  have been a
""
""
""
And we are tackling this  on a on a I would say on a mission
""
""
""
Could you could you tell our  viewers that what would be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It has these measures  it is it is not as
""
""
""
""
""
I 
""
For a litre of kerosene oil 
""
""
That 
""
For uh  and
""
""
For uh  three point three
""
""
""
""
The the the heaviest impose has been  on sugar which is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No but the fact is  that sugar has been very heavily
""
""
Whereas I do not think that who is good as far as the total
""
""
And I do not think that the railway should be called upon  to
""
""
We have been bearing our share 
""
""
What is the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
have had with the centre  there might be a certain amount of relief
""
""
But that we have to wait and see as to  what they are able to
do for us 
""
""
Mr Anand don't you think that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
you're 
""
""
""
And we have actually witness them in last two  in last two
""
""
follow

percent  ?
