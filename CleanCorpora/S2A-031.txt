dear students 
""
I feel it an honour  to deliver the
""
""
I should like to take this opportunity 
""
 in which the community around this
""
""
One of the weaknesses  of educational institutions in our
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
resources 
""
""
""
""
""
the children and the teachers of those institutions 
""
But there are very few if any  in which the
""
""
""
""
""
from the community  in
""
""
I am happy therefore to note 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I have been  not that I have been
""
option of selecting any particular topic under the  general theme of
education and society 
""
""
""
At the very outset  one understands that education and
development  what is the
relationship of education to society  ?
""
Historically  has
""
""
The traditional view of education has been  that it is geared
 and needs of the
""
""
And education is defined as 
""
cultivate active habits in him  and develop such skills and values and
""
development 
""
""
""
""
""
""
to develop his own personality 
""
""
The question 
""
""
to do for his society  in the
field of educational discussion 
""
That is supposed to be 
""
""
years of education  cultivate
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
larger societal purposes which education must serve  ?
""
""
education has become  one of the key activities in the very process of
modernisation 
""
""
fundamental problem  because education has become at once
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and the salient role of the education in it  that have brought to the fore
""
society 
""
Two major post second world war developments  account for this
""
""
One is the emergent from colonial rule  of the countries of Asia
""
instrument of modernisation and national development 
""
The other  is the growing awareness among the industrially
""
assurance  technological and industrial leadership
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
relevance to society 
""
""
""
""
""
This I call 
""
""
development 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
article of faith  is the
""
""
I call this the development function of education 
""
The third and equally important role of education  relates to
""
""
What do I mean by socialization function  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Every social system is based upon  its own unique value system
""
""
shared values and beliefs 
""
""
at birth  all
""
""
""
""
""
belief in human reason 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
""
""
there is the other view of education  as an agent of change and
""
""
""
""
""
we mean something more than political independence 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
egaliterian social order 
""
Unlike western societies where freedom usually meant freedom from
the state  and in other developing countries freedom means
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It would need to have  two components in its curricular content
""
""
""
""
""
education  beliefs
""
""
""
have both a theoritical and an applied aspect 
or socially useful productive work 
""
""
""
""
""
""
is a vital element in the process not only of comprehending  but also
""
""
""
""
""
system 
""
Rather it needs to be consciously oriented  towards the building
up of India  as a nation and towards the realization of our national goals
""
for all people will continually be rising 
""
Education is thus  a very important element in the process of
development 
""
But let me pause here for a moment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because much will depend upon  in the
""
education  that our teaching learning and everything else that goes in
""
colleges  will depend upon the clarity we have and the national consensus
we are able to build on this central concept of development 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Union or France  like the western
""
possible by a rapid process of industrialization  with central emphasis on
""
""
""
""
It is only when we have  that kind of process of development
 that we shall be
""
""
An India in which the citizens are assured of an ever increasing
""
""
That was  and
there was a near unanimity  on the need to adopt and imitate the western
""
""
But now 
""
Things are changing both in India  in other developing
""
