Professor Kamath 
other members of the  members
of the staff  my
dear students 
""
I feel it an honour  to deliver the
first 
""
I should like to take this opportunity 
professor Kamat and his colleagues  on the management of this institution
 in which the community around this
school 
""
One of the weaknesses  of educational institutions in our
society  with the
community outside  linking the
school 
""
We have talked of school school complex  we have talked of
school college complex  we have also talked of school community complex
""
""
Although a great deal can be done  even within the limited
resources 
""
We have not been able to accomplish much  in this very important
""
""
The activities in the school  are meant for
the children and the teachers of those institutions 
""
But there are very few if any  in which the
public can participate  or with the
college 
""
This failure  affected the ability of the educational
institutions 
from the community  in
diverse ways 
""
I am happy therefore to note 
and received positive response from Dr Maker  this
lecture series 
""
It is an honour for me  and I
hope that for many many years to come  the experts on various subjects
 because that professor Kamat
told me  and under
the rubbering of this general topic  more selected more specific topics
""
""
I have been  not that I have been
asked to  and I was given the
option of selecting any particular topic under the  general theme of
education and society 
""
And I have chosen to speak on education and development 
""
At the very outset  one understands that education and
development  what is the
relationship of education to society  ?
""
Historically  has
never been universally accepted 
""
The traditional view of education has been  that it is geared
 and needs of the
individual 
""
And education is defined as 
is to promote 
cultivate active habits in him  and develop such skills and values and
attitudes  in a well-rounded personality
development 
""
In other words 
as the principal  of individualist purpose of developmemnt of
ones own personality 
""
It is his aptitude 
to develop his own personality 
of education as an activity 
""
The question 
what should such a  what ought such
an individual  what ought such an individual
to do for his society  in the
field of educational discussion 
""
That is supposed to be 
""
We give him a package  over a period of ten fifteen or twenty
years of education  cultivate
certain values in him  and then we
send him out in the wide world 
""
Let him decide what he wants to do  whether he wants to lead a
life  or whether he wants to
be of some use to the community around him and to his own country is a
decision which the individual is supposed to take 
""
Therefore  of the
role of education in development  it may be useful to raise the general
question  or whether there are
larger societal purposes which education must serve  ?
""
The question has acquired urgency in modern times  because
education has become  one of the key activities in the very process of
modernisation 
""
Relationship between education  and society has become the most
fundamental problem  because education has become at once
""
""
Traditionally  society has looked upon education as a process by
which  and to transmit to succeeding
generation  beliefs and values
 and permanence depends
""
""
But in more recent times  and especially in the developing world
 education has increasingly
come to be looked upon  as one of the most potent instruments of
development 
""
As professor James Coleman 
once regarded as essentially conservative  and
culture transmiting institutions  as
the master determinent 
unquote 
""
Society has probably changed more 
than it did in the preceding three hundred years  and this is equally
true 
""
It is this continuous 
and the salient role of the education in it  that have brought to the fore
the question concerning the nature of relationship  between education and
society 
""
Two major post second world war developments  account for this
new awareness 
""
One is the emergent from colonial rule  of the countries of Asia
and Africa  as an effective
instrument of modernisation and national development 
""
The other  is the growing awareness among the industrially
advanced nations  that in the continued emphasis on education lies the
assurance  technological and industrial leadership
""
""
The earlier attitude  it
were a self sufficient  functioning in isolation
of prevailing socio-economic realities  was largely abandoned in favour of
the more positive concept of education 
interrelated with  and interacting with other sub-systems like the
economic sub- system or and the political sub-system 
""
There are at least three ways  in which education has direct
relevance to society 
""
First is the way  suitably trained
persons in required number  to man the million institutions through which
""
""
This I call 
""
Second  to economic
development 
""
Everywhere  the
belief in some kind of a cause-effect relationship  between education and
long term economic development 
""
The rulers of these countries  have been relying increasingly
 greater state
support 
""
Underlying this emphasis on economic development  is another
article of faith  is the
minimum indispensable requisite 
""
I call this the development function of education 
""
The third and equally important role of education  relates to
its socialization 
""
What do I mean by socialization function  ?
""
Socialization refers to that process  by which individuals
acquire values 
and towards their distinctive role 
""
Every social system is based upon  its own unique value system
""
 through
shared values and beliefs 
""
Education is the principal agency for this purpose  which begins
at birth  all
through life 
""
For example  a democratic society seeks to inculcate among its
members  and autonomy of
the human personality  and
belief in human reason 
""
A democratic society  a healthy
scepticism  and especially towards all
forms of dogma  and seeks the help of education to achieve these goals
""
""
I just now spoke  of the increasing expectations from education
 in social development in political development as well as economic
development  in
the 
I used the term development in a more comprehensive sense 
social as well as political 
""
As against the nineteenth century liberal view of education 
there is the other view of education  as an agent of change and
development  and it is that view which prevails in India among official
and non-official circles dealing with educational policy 
""
It is argued 
in a  if by freedom
we mean something more than political independence 
""
The Indian  its caste
system  and its anti-labour intellectual
culture  to its development as free society
""
""
And education will have to make a major effort  to create a more
egaliterian social order 
""
Unlike western societies where freedom usually meant freedom from
the state  and in other developing countries freedom means
freedom from want  in the eradication
of which 
""
In such a situation  a
far more positive content  than is visualised in liberal education concept
""
""
It would need to have  two components in its curricular content
 to their
immediate social environment  by participating creatively in the
transformation of that environment 
""
The first component would consist  of the conserving aspect of
education  beliefs
""
""
The second would be  which would
have both a theoritical and an applied aspect 
or socially useful productive work 
""
I do not have to  what a
mess we have already made  of both these useful concept of work experience
""
""
In India  in as much as it
is a vital element in the process not only of comprehending  but also
managing development  in our
pursuit 
""
Education being a catalystic having a catalystic role  it is
wrong to look upon it  and autonomous
system 
""
Rather it needs to be consciously oriented  towards the building
up of India  as a nation and towards the realization of our national goals
""
for all people will continually be rising 
""
Education is thus  a very important element in the process of
development 
""
But let me pause here for a moment 
what sort of development  ?
""
We all want to develop ourselves 
""
There are no two 
""
And we want to develop as fast as we can 
""
No two opinions about that either 
""
But what sort of development do we want  ?
""
Because much will depend upon  in the
conceptualization of  that our curriculum in
education  that our teaching learning and everything else that goes in
schools and colleges  the character of the activities in schools and
colleges  will depend upon the clarity we have and the national consensus
we are able to build on this central concept of development 
""
Until twenty or thirty years ago  developing countries like
India  what sort of development do you want
 that
industrialised countries of the west have achieved 
""
In other words  we want to
imitate the United States  Soviet
Union or France  like the western
industrialised society  have been made
possible by a rapid process of industrialization  with central emphasis on
basic industries 
""
We want large scale industrialized 
""
It is only when we have  that kind of process of development
 that we shall be
able to call ourselves 
""
An India in which the citizens are assured of an ever increasing
standard of life 
""
That was  and
there was a near unanimity  on the need to adopt and imitate the western
models of development 
""
But now 
""
Things are changing both in India  in other developing
countries  things are changing in the industrial
world  that
the model that was adopted and developed in their own countries is not
necessarily applicable all over the world
