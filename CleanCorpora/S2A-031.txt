Professor Kamath professor Dixit professor Joshi 
other members of the Vidyaprasarak Mandali members
of the staff of both the Kannada and the English high school my
dear students ladies and gentlemen 
I feel it an honour to have been invited to deliver the
first Dr Maker endowment lecture 
I should like to take this opportunity to compliment 
professor Kamat and his colleagues on the management of this institution
 to have thought of an activity in which the community around this
school can participate 
One of the weaknesses of educational institutions in our
society has been their failure to forge active links with the
community outside we have talked about many ideas linking the
school with the society 
We have talked of school school complex we have talked of
school college complex we have also talked of school community complex
 but very little has been done 
Although a great deal can be done even within the limited
resources of the schools and colleges 
We have not been able to accomplish much in this very important
 task of forging creative link with the community outside 
The activities in the school and in colleges are meant for
the children and the teachers of those institutions 
But there are very few if any activities in which the
public can participate and feel one with the school or with the
college 
This failure has affected the ability of the educational
institutions to draw vital sustainance financial and otherwise 
from the community which is in a position to help the institution in
diverse ways 
I am happy therefore to note that the society approached 
and received positive response from Dr Maker in whose name this
lecture series is instituted 
It is an honour for me to be the first speaker and I
hope that for many many years to come the experts on various subjects
 connected with education and society because that professor Kamat
told me is the general topic education and society and under
the rubbering of this general topic more selected more specific topics
 will be taken up by experts for exposition in future lectures 
I have been I have chosen rather not that I have been
asked to the general topic was suggested to me and I was given the
option of selecting any particular topic under the general theme of
education and society 
And I have chosen to speak on education and development 
At the very outset one understands that education and
development is part of a larger question namely what is the
relationship of education to society ?
Historically the inter relationship between the two has
never been universally accepted 
The traditional view of education has been that it is geared
 to the specific interest aptitude and needs of the
individual 
And education is defined as an activity whose purpose 
is to promote and develop various aptitudes in the child 
cultivate active habits in him and develop such skills and values and
attitudes as would finally result in a well-rounded personality
development 
In other words education has most often been looked upon 
as the principal means of individualist purpose of developmemnt of
ones own personality 
It is his aptitude it is his interest it is his need 
to develop his own personality that have constituted the main focus 
of education as an activity 
The question and in my view the more important question 
what should such a educated individual do or what ought such
an individual educated individual what ought such an individual
to do for his society or for his country is seldom raised in the
field of educational discussion 
That is supposed to be for each individual to decide 
We give him a package over a period of ten fifteen or twenty
years of education cultivate certain attitudes in him cultivate
certain values in him cultivate an outlook on life in him and then we
send him out in the wide world 
Let him decide what he wants to do whether he wants to lead a
life entirely devoted to personal development or whether he wants to
be of some use to the community around him and to his own country is a
decision which the individual is supposed to take 
Therefore before going into the specific question of the
role of education in development it may be useful to raise the general
question whether education is an end in itself or whether there are
larger societal purposes which education must serve ?
The question has acquired urgency in modern times because
education has become one of the key activities in the very process of
modernisation 
Relationship between education and society has become the most
fundamental problem of our age because education has become at once
 the principal means of preservation as well as of change 
Traditionally society has looked upon education as a process by
which to conserve to enrich and to transmit to succeeding
generation the accumulated knowledge skills beliefs and values
 on which the society's cohesion and permanence depends
But in more recent times and especially in the developing world
 and India belongs to the developing world education has increasingly
come to be looked upon as one of the most potent instruments of
development and also of change 
As professor James Coleman said and I quote 
once regarded as essentially conservative culture preserving and
culture transmiting institutions education now tends to be viewed as
the master determinent of all aspects of growth and change 
unquote 
Society has probably changed more in the last thirty years 
than it did in the preceding three hundred years and this is equally
true of both the developed world and of the developing world 
It is this continuous and often profound societal change 
and the salient role of the education in it that have brought to the fore
the question concerning the nature of relationship between education and
society 
Two major post second world war developments account for this
new awareness 
One is the emergent from colonial rule of the countries of Asia
and Africa whose leaders at once turned to education as an effective
instrument of modernisation and national development 
The other is the growing awareness among the industrially
advanced nations that in the continued emphasis on education lies the
assurance of their scientific technological and industrial leadership
 and even hegemony 
The earlier attitude of treating education as though it
were a self sufficient and autonomous system functioning in isolation
of prevailing socio-economic realities was largely abandoned in favour of
the more positive concept of education as a social sub-system 
interrelated with and interacting with other sub-systems like the
economic sub- system or and the political sub-system 
There are at least three ways in which education has direct
relevance to society 
First is the way education produces suitably trained
persons in required number to man the million institutions through which
 society lives and grows 
This I call the leadership function of education 
Second is the contribution education makes to economic
development both in terms of skills and attitude 
Everywhere and particularly in the developing countries the
belief in some kind of a cause-effect relationship between education and
long term economic development has become almost an article of faith 
The rulers of these countries have been relying increasingly
 on considerations of economic development to justify greater state
support as well as greater state control of education 
Underlying this emphasis on economic development is another
article of faith namely that rapid economic development is the
minimum indispensable requisite of democratic political development 
I call this the development function of education 
The third and equally important role of education relates to
its socialization including political socialization function 
What do I mean by socialization function ?
Socialization refers to that process by which individuals
acquire values attitudes and feelings towards the social system 
and towards their distinctive role in the social system 
Every social system is based upon its own unique value system
 and seeks to perpetuate itself by creating an app 
 appropriate ideological support structure through
shared values and beliefs among members of that society 
Education is the principal agency for this purpose which begins
at birth and continues through both formal and non-formal ways all
through life 
For example a democratic society seeks to inculcate among its
members values of freedom tolerance dignity and autonomy of
the human personality justice and fair play respect for truth and
belief in human reason and its capacity to solve human problems 
A democratic society also seeks to encourage a healthy
scepticism towards authority and power and especially towards all
forms of dogma and seeks the help of education to achieve these goals
I just now spoke of the increasing expectations from education
 in social development in political development as well as economic
development and I used the word development not merely in
the in the rather narrow sense of economic development 
I used the term development in a more comprehensive sense of economic 
social as well as political 
As against the nineteenth century liberal view of education 
there is the other view of education as an agent of change and
development and it is that view which prevails in India among official
and non-official circles dealing with educational policy 
It is argued that India is not yet a free society 
in a fun in a fundamental sense if by freedom
we mean something more than political independence 
The Indian society's hierarchical structure its caste
system inequitus economic system and its anti-labour intellectual
culture are formidable barriers to its development as free society
And education will have to make a major effort to create a more
egaliterian social order as a means to real freedom 
Unlike western societies where freedom usually meant freedom from
the state in India and in other developing countries freedom means
freedom from want hunger ignorance and disease in the eradication
of which the state is expected to play a pivotal role 
In such a situation education for freedom would have a
far more positive content than is visualised in liberal education concept
It would need to have two components in its curricular content
 to enable students to relate their educational experience to their
immediate social environment by participating creatively in the
transformation of that environment to desired end 
The first component would consist of the conserving aspect of
education and would be dealing with knowledge information beliefs
 values and attitudes 
The second would be the participatory component which would
have both a theoritical and an applied aspect such as work experience 
or socially useful productive work 
I do not have to tell an audience of school teacher what a
mess we have already made of both these useful concept of work experience
 and socially useful productive work 
In India education is critically relevant in as much as it
is a vital element in the process not only of comprehending but also
managing development and change which are two crucial input in our
pursuit of a modern nation making 
Education being a catalystic having a catalystic role it is
wrong to look upon it as a self-contained neutral and autonomous
system 
Rather it needs to be consciously oriented towards the building
up of India as a nation and towards the realization of our national goals
 of a rapid economic development in which the standards of living 
for all people will continually be rising 
Education is thus a very important element in the process of
development 
But let me pause here for a moment and ask the question 
what sort of development ?
We all want to develop ourselves 
There are no two opinions about that 
And we want to develop as fast as we can 
No two opinions about that either 
But what sort of development do we want ?
Because much will depend upon our clarity in the
conceptualization of quote unquote development that our curriculum in
education that our teaching learning and everything else that goes in
schools and colleges the character of the activities in schools and
colleges will depend upon the clarity we have and the national consensus
we are able to build on this central concept of development 
Until twenty or thirty years ago developing countries like
India answered the questions what sort of development do you want
 by saying we want much the same sort of development that
industrialised countries of the west have achieved 
In other words we want to imitate England we want to
imitate the United States we want to imitate Germany Japan Soviet
Union or France we want to become like the western
industrialised society whose high standards of living have been made
possible by a rapid process of industrialization with central emphasis on
basic industries 
We want large scale industrialized civilization 
It is only when we have that kind of process of development
 based on rapid industrialization of the economy that we shall be
able to call ourselves modern India a developed India 
An India in which the citizens are assured of an ever increasing
standard of life 
That was the general acceptance of the western model and
there was a near unanimity on the need to adopt and imitate the western
models of development 
But now things are changing 
Things are changing both in India in other developing
countries but more importantly things are changing in the industrial
world the western world itself as they have begun to see that
the model that was adopted and developed in their own countries is not
necessarily applicable all over the world
