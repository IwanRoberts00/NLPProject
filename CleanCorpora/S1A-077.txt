<I>
Ah like we were talking about the hostel 
Yeah 
Now what is the system of the hostel uh 
System system is all corruption you see laughter 
Better we should
You see we say in Punjabi one word 
 Laughs 
Better we should not talk about the corruption 
No what I am telling is I am staying in the hostel
 and it's the vacation time
 Yes yes 
Ah ha ha
So there is no rule to for students who stay in the hostel
there is no time study for one word 
Ah ha ha 
Since I don't have any study one word so this is
all that uh
Yeah
Which we say in Punjabi
Uhm uhm 
Somewhere then you might
Generally like uh we have heard about uh the electricity
usage 
Uh we can use uh what uh this kind of uh apparatus
 or uh we can use or not like heater 
And some boys use it and uh some some are allowed and some
are not allowed 
 Appliances 
Depends laughs uh upon his relation with the
warden
Yeah 
Yeah
Well like uh I think heater taking heater is not
the useful now a days because uh in the bathroom they have geysers
now a days 
Geysers are there uh one geyser for twenty boys
For twenty boys 
 For twenty rooms 
Ah ha ha 
And uh there are twenty boys and geyser you can
initially get two three buckets 
And after that water is cold 
 Water is cold yeah
So 
 That's the problem
More than we get ready within time before nine
And may be sometimes geyser is working right or
sometime it's uh 
 Nei it's no problem 
Ah ha 
Actually department is okay 
Ah ha 
But uh you can have two three buckets after that 
it's all cold water 
Right 
That mean uh cough most of the students uh needing
this kind of heater electric rod or something like that 
They think their bathing is necessity not luxury 
laughter what warden says
Ah yes 
So what kind of uh uh fine they put 
Fine is according to the appliances 
Means I was using uh heater plus rod
Ah ha 
Plus two tubes plus two table lamps 
Ah ha
And uh laughs uh one thing more stereo

Ah and T V
Everything was on ah ha and I was sitting and
reading magazine 
 Ah ha 
Okay lucky you have social room 
Warden came laughter warden knocked at the door
and I just opened the door
Uhm 
He said what are you doing ?
Then he saw the 
As a kind of fine they charged some amount of
money
 Fined he 
He fined me rupees five hundred but I paid
nothing laughs 
He must have a
This is what I told you earlier depends
upon the relation
 Yeah ah 
Uhm uhm uhm 
So vehicle is not uh in the rule I mean you can have it not 
scooter or motorcycle or car you can have anything 
 These things your personal matter it's 
not a hostel matter
Right 
I mean that like uh there is no such parking problem or
some
No there is a 
Garage problem or something
No no there is
 One word some boys have cars with them 
one word 
Not uh common everybody some occasionally
they get from home for month or two
 Some 
For month or two
Enjoy laughs 
Right 
And fifty percent may be having scooter or motorcycle 
Scooters fifty-five students have actually
Yeah 
Mostly hostel number one has cough most of the
bikes two wheelers 
Right 
Since they are a goonda persons most of
them laughs 
Students are there
Uh because uh when one person is living very near to
his institution just fifty metres or hundred metres away from his college
or department so he can go on by foot or
He he has he has some other work to do
Yeah 
Not only study laughs so he faces problem
Yeah right 
Everytime you can't walk
Yeah 
And you can't have a bus Chandigarh ci city
you know how it's working
Ah ha 
You can't have bus even for one hour 
Yes yes 
Sometimes 
Ah sometime you have to go away to meet your teacher for some
collecting notes 
Yeah 
Or to meet some friends 
This is really laughs these things happen really
Since teacher teachers have
efficient way provide everything in the department 
Oh yes laughter 
 
Want to try ?
Okay 
What did you eat this in this uh noon ?
Noon yeah something you have rice chapati
 and one sabji plus rice 
Rice chapati 
Uh what quality of kind they gave uh in uh your
Quality is not that much okay 
Yeah but for some old students that is okay since they 
Old students they get uh I mean uh what kind of
preparation they prepare it they are well cooked and uh or
not or half cooked or something in between ?
 Preparation 
Preparation is okay for it depends on see it is uh
subjective 
Yeah
Depends uh if a person is older
Yeah 
And he is bullish like that 
Ah ha 
So he gets uh well food
Ah ha 
But if uh 
Taste taste ?
But it depends uh preparation is not okay for
 in general 
And uh I think you go sometime outside to have a 
better taste and better food 
Food 
Generally 
Two three times a a week 
Two three times a week once the routine ah
ha 
 Change 
Just to have a different taste we go to Sector eleven 
Lady market 
Eleven 
Or Sector fifteen there is a Prince restaurant
Ah ha 
That is cheap and best for students
 Cheap 
But might something 
 We can't afford that much uh expensive hotels
like one word 
Ah ha 
And so we go 
Right 
And uh about uh dinner ?
Dinner is something better than the lunch 
Ah ha 
Yeah 
So dinner we have a daal and sabji
 
 Daal is good 
No daal always daal is
okay 
Yeah 
Means you have desi ghee that you 
laughs so that you know that like me that I 
 Oh yes 
And uh about the conditions are this year I am
planning to be in the food committee I've talked to
the warden
 Accha 
Right right 
So he said okay uh he will appoint four five members
Uhm
We are trying for cooperativeness 
Yes 
Ah so if he has the a a all of them like 
chapati and daal or chawal 
they are well cooked not overcooked sometime or not uh 
No this is not the case
Case is the spices are not good qua of good
 quality or the ghee is not of good
quality 
 Ah ha 
 So that way you can't say you can't tell
it is really well cooked or it is
Cooked is okay sir Cook he is one word 
 Uh like chilli they use more chilli then you
can't tell
No this is not this is not the case 
Uhm uhm
Chilli they have they have a routine 
Like there is a joke you know uh when a person went
to in a hostel 
He was married
Uhm 
And he was uh staying alone 
So he said uh hello waiter bring me some burnt
 chapatis ?
Bring me some burnt toast ?
He said sir why ?
Because uh I'm you know feeling sickness of my
home laughs 
You know I want to have rice at laughter 
So you know uh some sometimes uh a married person he
want to feel free so he goes to hostel 
When he want wants to uh remind his
 feel uh bachelor days some kind of feel a new bachelor 
I have my mamaji here 
Uhm uhm 
Not exactly my mamaji but a relation
like mamaji 
Uhn uhn 
So he used to talk to me that food bring
some thing
Uhm uhm
 Sabji from your hostel laughter 
two words so that I too I too want to feel that those old days
Even then that some kind of things that reminds you some
 uh uh when you were young
Everything is related to laughter something else
Something else 
No while not also not only of food but 
something else 
 You think of something else exactly
Like that and all 
So there in uh those enjoyments so fun 
 This phase is the best phase of 
someone's life
Yeah yeah 
 That's what I think 
Ah 
Even I don't want to be out of this city laughter
 That's why I'm staying here after my
completion of post graduation 
 Oh yes yes 
 
You have some two or three meals uh breakfast and 
lunch and dinner and 
Yeah three major meals 
 
Yeah what what all what do they serve ?
In breakfast uh you get it's upon you 
it's upon your taste 
You can have parathas you can have bread 
butter bread omelette 
You can have bread jam 
So many things like you feel they'll have in the hostel
 or in home 
So it's your taste 
And you can have tea cold drink milk anything 
what you can think of in the in a breakfast 
What else ?
And uh breakfast you know there that's the
place where cooking is not okay 
Since in the morning there is a great rush 
Everyone has to go to their department before nine
 Great rush yeah 
Yes 
So most of the students get ready by eight thirty 
And everyone rushes in the mess and canteen eight
thirty and they ask for quick supply 
 Eight thirty 
 That's what has some times we noticed that a
 a little more time can be can make it more better that uh 
food
But this is not possible means uh 
 Right yeah 
 That's why I was talking how they cook I mean they 
overcook see or less cooked
 See 
Afternoon and uh uhm dinner and lunch is okay
Since they have plenty of time 
They are back from their department
But in the morning they have to go to the department
 Ah ha 
Yes yes 
And if they get late they may they may miss 
their class
 And that 
Then they do not bother about the taste they have just
eat it and rush like that 
 They don't bother about anything 
laughter 
This is uh Punjab 
They have to go
Those are points where the problem arises
Yeah 
They ask for quality plus quick supply
Plus quick supply yes yes 
Uhm even the cook has to his matlab
 it depends ke us ke pas uh that material is
there 
He has to make something raw material and then cook it 
It takes sometimes 
 So 
Now you have uh completed your M A second year
Yeah 
So what's your planning now ?
What you have planned ?
I am just two words was there four five old 
laughs 
I have four five years uh one word 
Ah ha 
But I am unfortunately couldn't decide till now 
Ah ha 
And I I am planning for a teaching profession 
I have been offered a job as ad hoc professor of English 
in my college where I've studied
I have done my graduation
Ah ha it's very good
I am also planning for M Phil or Ph D 
Since I have discussed the topic with my professors
Uhm
I don't know anything about the what we have to do 
what is there 
So I have to
Is the teaching system
I have 
How that we should read
Why we have to read why what we have to study
Ah ha 
What is the procedure 
Is there any exam is there research so I don't know
anything
I just know it's M Phil it's Ph D
 It's Ph D
Just like M A 
So I don't know anything and uhm I am planning for 
career in customs 
I have applied uh filled the forms for there is a post 
Inspector Customs and Income Tax 
And for the one word 
 Ah ha right right 
That means you have no definite programme where wherever
you get the better opportunity you'll go 
 Not only not have a definite see which is if
you uh stick to one thing cough 
Uh you take the case of I A S preparation uh
 one word aspiration everything uh 
So if we take a single option
 Uhm right 
Yeah 
And we uh didn't succeed in future
Yeah 
 It's a problematic one word 
Yeah 
Since I have seen persons
Persons that's right
Who have been staying here for last six seven years in my
hostel
Uhm 
And they are trying only for I A S
Yes 
And unfortunately many persons they are not that
much of that much level or may be possible luck 
doesn't favour them
 They did not get through 
 Yes yes 
Ah 
So they are nowhere now a days
Right 
And uh three or four of my best friends
Uhm uhm 
Two of them have left for their homes after wasting
their seven years
Oh 
So you can think if you stick to single option 
 I don't think we'll ever succeed
 Yes yes 
Uh now a days we have to 
 Since there are three four options
Yes 
So you go any try three four ways
Uh 
And if you succeed in any one way it's alright 
Right 
And uh same is the case for U G C 
Uhm
If anyone everyone ask I have to be professor 
 it is difficult since population is increasing and jobs are
that much
 Oh yeah 
Limited 
Yeah 
In every fields jobs are limited
This is all case of population 
Yes laughs 
Since people are doesn't bother even the uhm 
family planning programme is not okay I don't think they advertise on T
V on radio 
If a person is poor how can he afford T V or radio 
Oh yes even if he uh watches uh
television or hears radio he doesn't imply to his own you know
 One word
