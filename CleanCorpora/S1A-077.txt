Ah like we were talking about the hostel 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Now what is the system of the hostel 
""
""
System system is all 
""
""
Better we should
""
""
You see we say in Punjabi 
""
""
""
""
Better we should not talk about the corruption 
""
""
No what I am telling is  hostel
 the vacation time
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha ha
""
""
So there is no rule to  for students who stay in the hostel
there is no time study for 
""
""
Ah ha ha 
""
""
Since I don't have any study  so this is
all that uh
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Which we say in Punjabi
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Somewhere then you might
""
""
Generally like uh we have heard about uh the  electricity
usage 
""
Uh we can use  apparatus
""
""
And some boys use it  some are allowed and some
are not allowed 
""
""
""
""
""
Depends  uh upon his relation with the
warden
""
""
Yeah 
""
""

""
""
Well like uh  taking heater is not
the  uh in the bathroom they have geysers
now a days

""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha ha

And uh  you can
initially get 
""
And after that 
""
""

""
""
So 
""
""
 the problem
""
""
More than we get ready within time before nine
""
""
And may be sometimes geyser is working  or
sometime 
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha

Not uh  occasionally
they get from home  for month or two
""

Scooters fifty-five students have actually

Mostly  most of the
bikes 
""

Right 
""

Since they are a  most of
them 
""
Students are there

And uh  the
place where cooking is not okay 
""
Since in the morning there 
""
Everyone has to go to their department before nine
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So most of the students get ready by eight thirty 
""
And everyone rushes  eight

But this is not possible 
""

Afternoon and uh  uhm dinner and lunch is okay

Since they have plenty of time

They are back from their department
""
But in  morning they have to go to the department
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes 
""
""
And if they get late 
their class
""
""
""
""
""
Then they do not bother about the taste they have  just
eat it and rush 
""
""
""
laughter 
""
This is uh Punjab 
""
""
They have to go
""
""
Those are points where the problem arises
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
They ask for quality plus quick supply
""
""
Plus quick supply yes yes 
""
""
Uhm  matlab
 that material is
there 
""
He has to make something raw material and then cook it 
""
It takes 
""
""
""
""
Now you have uh  completed your M A second year
""
""

""
""
So  ?

""
I have four five years uh 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
But I am 
""
""

""
""
And I I am planning for 
""
I have been offered a job as ad hoc 
in my college where  studied
""
I have done my graduation
""
""
Ah ha  very good
""
""
I am also planning for 
""
Since I have discussed the topic with my professors
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I don't know anything about the 
what is there 
""
So I have to
""
""
Is the teaching system
""
""
I have 
""
""
How that  we should read
""
""
Why we have to read  why what we have to study
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
What is the procedure 
""
Is there any exam  so I don't know
anything
""
I just know  Ph D
""
""
 Ph D
""
""
Just like M A 
""
So I don't know anything 
career in customs 
""
I have applied uh filled the forms for 
Inspector Customs and 
""
And for the 
""
""
""
""
""
That means you have no definite programme where  wherever
you get the 
""
""
 see which is if
you 
""
Uh you take the case of I A S  uh
""
""
So  if we take a single option
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And we uh  didn't succeed in future
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Since  I have seen persons
""
""
Persons  right
""
""
Who have been staying here for last six seven years in my
hostel
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And they are trying only for I A S
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And unfortunately  many persons they are not that
much 
doesn't  favour them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
So  they are nowhere now a days
""
""
Right 
""
""
And uh  three or four of my best friends
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Two of them have left for their homes  after wasting
their seven years
""
""
Oh 
""
""
So you can think if you stick to 
 ever succeed
""
""
""
""
""
Uh now a days 
""
""
 three four options
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So you go any  try three four ways
""
""
Uh 
""
""
And if you succeed in any one way 
""
""
Right 
""
""
And uh 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
If anyone 
 jobs are
that much
""
""
""
""
""
Limited 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
In every fields  jobs are limited
""
""
This is all case of population 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Since people are 
family planning programme is not okay I don't think  they advertise on T
V 
""
If a person is poor 
""
""
Oh yes  uh watches uh
television or hears radio  you know
""
""
""
