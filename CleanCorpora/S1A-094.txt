<I>
Hello 
Hello 
Hello 
 Haan good afternoon 
Good afternoon
How are you ?
Yeah I'm alright 
 Accha this uh did you convey that message
about tin oxide ?
Yeah I have conveyed to them 
Ah
Now the fifty k g might be a problem
They are saying uh take hundred because for from the point
of view of packing and transporting ah they are saying
take hundred k g's 
 Ah 
But hundred 
Can I ask them for airfreight hundred k g's ?
Hundred k g is too big quantity you now 
Ah that's what they are saying ah 
 I've sent them a telex again
 Ah 
Yeah 
To see what they are why they are saying that 
No but then I can do one thing
Ahn 
If you can ask them to uh uh pay for the advance
Ahn 
I can also arrange the advance 
 Nahi nahi they are not talking about money
Uhm 
They are not talking about money
Yeah 
They are only saying 
 Haan 
Fifty k g's will be hundred k g's will
be economical 
 Haan 
Fifty k g's will not be economical 
No for air freight fifty k g is okay for us
 Haan no for you it is okay
Yeah
But there is some other implication there 
haan which might increase the cost that is what I am worried
 Haan 
No but let them specify that no ?
 Haan 
Why there should be increase ?
 Haan 
Why there should be an increase
No I've asked them why ?
Yeah 
So let them tell us uh I mean I got the message
But I remember last time also they have airshipped fifty k g
No no no that was the first time sometime back
Yeah 
When they first started 
But they can also help us nahi nahi
 second time
 Nahi nahi 
 Nahi nahi it's not the question of
helping 
Yeah
They should do it 
Yeah
Unless they have specific problem
 Haan haan 
Which I have asked them to spell out
Uhm uhm 
 Haan 
Ah 
But in which case you know they what they say whether it is
fifty k g or hundred k g haan it will be
they will be able to air freight by the end of the next week
 Haan 
Oh but then what is the use ?
Ah 
You see by by end of this month I'll I'll get
the consignmnet 
Yeah by the end of
See my worry is Ahn that between uh end
of this month and uh second week of uh uh what is that uh January 
 ahn I'll have problems 
 Ahn 
 Ahn 
 Nahi what I'm saying 
yeah if the air freight is end of next week
 Yeah 
 Haan 
Air freight it takes about three days na ?
But it takes about ten days for clearance 
Is that ?
Yeah
 Haan haan 
So now you see they have to immediately ship fifty k g
Immediately they say it's not possible
 Haan 
See they can uh earliest they can dispatch before the 
end of next week 
End of next week is too long
 Haan 
So can you please ask them that you can also represent our
problem no ?
 Nahi nahi I've already represented
 I'm saying it is an additional requirement
 Haan 
It is because as as of the time that'll be taken
for the two fifty k g's to be received by them
Yeah
They want fifty k g urgently 
But why at all they have shipped so late ?
Ahn 
Why at all they've shipped so late ?
See when the L C was open ahn during uh first week
of November
 Ahn 
Ahn
They have shipped by end of uh uh November
 Haan 
So that has caused the whole problem
Yeah yeah 
But even L C must was not the first week of November sir
Yeah 
Any way that there is no point in my arguing with you
Yeah 
But the thing is this now they say by end of next week 
 is 
 But I I firmly believe that if you convince
them on phone haan they will definitely ship
fifty k g
 Haan 
 Nahi nahi nahi you see the point is
 Haan 
Uh this the material may not be available readily
 Haan 
Fifty k g's or hundred k g's 
 Haan 
So they have to make it and then send it
 Haan 
So that is why they've said next week 
but 
 Any way they've to manifacture it now
 <[ > we're their regular customers 
 Any way I've I've no I
don't want to delay any further
Yeah 
Suppose they say next week should I ask them to go ahead ?
Yeah you ask them to go ahead
 Haan but hundred k g's you
don't want ?
No hundred k g's 
But fifty k g's there might be some price
implications I'm trying to verify why 
See that is all negligible 
No any way I'll come back to you 
Ah
Ah
Ah 
Okay 
But it is you've to act very fast 
No no I can't act faster than what I am doing now
Ah 
But only thing is you uh as soon as I get the 
clarification for the price yeah I'll ring you up
 Yeah 
Okay
Then you will have to comfirm to me yes or no 
Okay 
Okay 
Thank you very much

So now our agent ahn has asked for a
indemnity bond and hundred rupees stamp paper

instructions to their bankers ahn that this cheque has been
lost by in transit

bond to be kept in their file

 That comes in the one word 
That comes in the narration if you see
Uh I have got that uh yeah there is uhm
 issued by the Bharat Electricals Limited

 This is the standard 
Yeah this is the standard format
Instead of that we should address it directly to the
Bharat Electricals

any indemnity bonds for any government customers

undelivered parcels

Because I'll tell you what has happened you know 
 Haan haan haan 
 TELCO is borrowing at twenty-four
twenty-five
 Haan haan 
 To sab paisa udhar chala ja raha hai

 Accha 
See no all the money is going there 
But you can give this particular total updation to
anybody no 
Which one ?
Uh that it's a Zee Company
 and all that
 Yeah yeah 
 Nahi but logonko kya mentality hai
 TELCO deta hai to kuch problem
 nahi na 
Ah ha ha 
 Accha another thing is that if you can get a
bill
 Ye infact jab ye auto
recession hai 
Yeah 
 To if the TELCO is
 if TELCO name is there yeah that
should get secondary importance actually laughs 
 Yeah 
 Nahi lekin TELCO 
 ka nam hai na 
Yeah now of course that is a different thing 
No I'll tell you what is happening you know many of
 these finance companies
 Ahn 
 Haan haan ha 
They are collecting I C D's from all these people
 Haan haan ha 
And lending to TELCO 
Yeah 
You know because TELCO doesn't take
below one crore 
 Accha 
They are inter-related
So they're making a pool and lending to
TELCO 
 Yeah they're making a pool
Is it like that
Yeah laughter 
And they're doing pool cost to cost you know
 Haan haan ha 
The point one percent you know 
Ah ha ha accha second thing 
Yeah
This Nagendrarao of Apple
 Haan 
Uh he contacted
 Haan haan 
For the same matter 
Yeah
And I told him
You refuses na 
I I told him point blankly
Very good
That that will not be possible
Yeah 
This is something like a badla chahi ye 
laughter uhn so in that case yeah if at all 
 he's asking me the exchange of some securities
 Yeah 
Yeah yeah
I I I told him that better we we'll settle the
account 
Correct correct
Uh 
So immature jaisa act kare na
Correct corect 
Even this phono office no how much I've to call
for this commission
Ah ha ha yeah uh so
I told him very point blank that if you don't give the
commission accha I'm going to tell
 ELPRO not to give you money again 
 Accha 
Is it uh Nagendrarao talked to you ?
No 
 Accha 
Why he told you like that ?
Uh no nothing like that but I thought that 
whether he has contacted me directly or through you oh or
 he has at least kept you inform something like that
 He also lied 
 Oh 
 Nahi nahi nahi in these cases street smart
you know 
Ha ha ha 
That you know about it
Ha ha ha laughs 
These Sindhi types 
 Accha 
You know what he thinks one word 
Ha ha ha
I told him that you will not exchange securities
Ha ha
He thinks I'm lying 
 Nahi nahi nahi infact he was totally under
the impression that if he talks to me he can convinced and he can okay the
deal 
Something like that 
Okay he's a big shot kya 
laughter 
No no last last time also uhn uh there
was a little bit resistance in the beginnig
 Uhn 
Yeah
And at least then we also thought that okay we will have also
to keep the relations
Yeah 
And
Whom did you exchange last time
Uhn ?
You really
No last time we exchanged na 
Yeah 
Yeah yeah 
 Accha 
We exchanged last time and last time then he reimbursed
us TISCO some securities uhm in
exchange of Auto Light 
 Uhm 
 Arre you gave him Kya ?
 Nahi ye to that time we gave it
 Accha 
Uh but with the clearcut understanding ahn ahn
 that this type of deal will not be entertained in future
 Ahn ahn 
 Accha accha 
So whenever you'll be dealing in the securities
please bear in mind yeah and how come your securities
department is not aware that some securities are uh pledged 
 wohi wohi haan pledged with some other
person and will not be available for selling till this particular dates
 correct and they are freely entering into any sort of
deal yeah and then asking us to exchange some
securities 
 Yeah 
 Wohi 
 Correct 
 Yeah 
These guys I'm telling you 
Ah
Very poorly managed
Ah ha ha 
Now now also he is telling me like that only that if you
insist on settling the account we can even settle the account
 Haan 
 Lekin apko interest dena hai to
muzhe kuch kamana bhi hai to with that one I'm 
requesting you that you please release this one karke 
 Nahi nahi I didn't follow one word
 again 
Uh he says that now when I'm 
borrowing from you yeah I've to earn also
something uhm uhm and with that one uh this particular
deal is giving me some good amount of profit ah 
So if at all you are exchanging these securities I'll
 be uh good in the market otherwise I will have to go back
on my words 
 Yeah 
 Uhm uhm 
 Ah 
Tell him to go back laughter 
These guys are all these all natak haan 
Ha ha ha 
 He's used the money for bill discounting 
Ha ha ha 
Not for uh this thing 
Correct correct 
So you tell him not to give the money 
Correct
 Two words 
Let us see
Uhn 
Perhaps
Anyway now he is acting smart because it is already due
 na 
 Accha accha accha 
 Ekvees ko due hai na 
Ha ha ha 
Perhaps this Vivek Chaubal haan 
or Nagendrarao haan some uh 
somebody from these two they will contact you yeah 
 to 
 Haan 
 Haan 
 Yeah 
 I'm putting my foot down
Correct corect correct 
You know what they are thinking is that I'm 
refusing without asking to ELPRO 
 Haan haan haan 
Because you know sort of I they think that I don't want
to exert and go to ELPRO and Company 
 Haan haan haan 
I told him this see professional company nobody
 will do
 This this this 
This type of things are strictly business deal
Yeah
How can they are even I would have thought it twice even
before to request
Yeah laughter 
No another thing I'll tell you no some banks exchange
securities
 Haan haan 
But if they exchange they charge them for it
Yeah yeah
You know like supposing I take and overdraft from 
let's say City Bank 
Yeah
And uh for every certificate that I exchange they charge
some five hundred rupees 
Exactly 
Will they pay you ?
Exactly 
Uh ha 
Uh 
Give this idea to R K M 
 Laughs 
No any way R K M's coming on Sunday
 Accha 
 To till that time I've not
commented any thing but I have given my indication that this is virtually
impossible
Yeah
But I will open up just a topic as a sort of formality
with R K Mehta
 Chalega 
Okay if at all he thinks that okay we've to keep
the relations and we've to think otherwise 
Yeah
Okay then why why I should be bad in their eyes 
laughs 
Correct correct 
But this is very unprofessional
Correct correct 
No it is not done normally
Yeah yeah
 Abhi aap baki ka one word 
dekho na where we have had trouble
Yeah yeah 
In fact but Konthal got realized
He got realized na 
Konthal got realized
 He's a thorough gentleman 
Even the Tata two words that got realized
 Accha 
 I've absolutely no problem
No problem
 I've single transaction clean deal
Yeah 
And got settled 
Correct correct 
Uh with a word of thanks that's all
 Ek hi isme kitna gadbad and 
 gadbad hai 
 And 
Yes yes uh 
At one time they have to give the tedious certificate and other
time they have to give the post- dated cheque for the interest
 at other time they have to exchange the security 
 Yeah posing for the one or two words 
 A few words 
Capital and not interest no 
Exactly laughs and so so many things
Yeah that is true 
 Chalo any way
Uhn 
See you 
 Chalega 
Uh but uh please officially talk to R K
Mehta on Sunday
 Yeah I've got it in mind yeah 
Sure 
Ahn 
Okay
Okay
