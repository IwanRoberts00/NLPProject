This is the beginning of novels  beginnings of novel in
""
""
Now before I take up this uh  subject there is query from a
""
""
""
""
literature 
""
Because Australian literature as you know is quite new 
""
""

 uhm outside world into inside world
""
Then she talks of 
""
This is a voyage
""
""
""
Even this East West encounter is a voyage

""
""
And they give  uh atleast twelve
""
""

""
""
""
""

Second thing is  that

""
""

""
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
Similarly Indian Society for Commonwealth studies  of which
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
well both the names are so similar 
""
Their is Australian-Indian 
""
Uh where we set up  uh Australian
government is very helpful  are in
""
""
""
concerned  uh Australian government has a very liberal norm in giving
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 Poona University is third Bombay University Calcutta University Bangalore
""
these seven eight Universities  then Central University
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Patrick White because he is the only 
""
And uh  I think all
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
four months 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
institutions 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which is the literary history of  an excellent
""
""
If you were to look at that book  you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  and
short stories 
both in England  India since ages
""
""
""
""
""
""
In England as all of us know  uh the origin of
""
Henry Fielding and Richardson 
""
""
""
""
""
first two novels in nineteenth century only 
""
Uhm  there is the controversy which is the first
""
""
But we can talk of some first great novels  and one of them is
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because novel in India is a classic collective expressions 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Hindi is uh  just now a national language
""
It doesn't have a identity of its own
""
So Hindi could also be termed as only a regional literature
""
""
and all 
""
So this is a collective expression
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
was no novel 
""
""
missionaries 
""
When they came to India 
and since they wanted people  our
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is the basic  so if you want to note down the
""
 is new to India
""
Now novel you put in double inverted commas 
""
""
""
""
""
""
back to several centuries 
""
""
that 
""
""
""
""
""
second point is that  because of the western impact on India
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
wanted Indians to read the Bible  so they read our languages and then
""
""
""
""
And then from the prose medium 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
regional languages of India  comprises fiction of some length produced in
""
""
""
""
""
establishment of Sir William Fort college  a
""
""
""
to popularise  Christianity
""
But in the process it also gave fillip to the spread of education
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It has been rightly held as a first  first significant novel
""
""
But there is a controversy because there are so many so many
""
""
So it is the first significant novel 
""
""
published in eighteen-ninety 
""
It faced some controversy you know year this side or that side but
""
""
Uhm  now one thing we have to keep in mind is that Chandu
Menon was not a professional writer 
""
He was a judge by profession
""
He was a lawyer then judge  and he can be compared for that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
impressed 
""
And uhm  he felt that he should write
""
""
""
people English language 
""
Uh he was a typical Indian person who was  uh accost to English
""
it 
""
""
""
""
""
And one of his friends  uh there is a
""
Henrietta I remember  uh this is Henrietta
""
""
Please just write down the name of the novel 
""
This was written by Benjamin Disreily
