This is the beginning of novels  beginnings of novel in
India 
""
Now before I take up this uh  subject there is query from a
colleague of ours 
""
She has uh  she is willing to know as to where we can get
material critical material  on Australian
literature 
""
Because Australian literature as you know is quite new 
""
Uh from amongst uh  lot of
work is being done in Canadian literature
""
This is 
I am giving you this piece of information  because there are number
of fellowships  for Commonwealth uh studies
""
""
And uh 
""
Now uh  literatures in Commonwealth again be divided into two
parts one is White one is Black 
""
In White we have three major 
Canadian 
""
Uh  and in Black you know most of these literatures Nigerian
South African 
""
Now there won't be many fellowships in  as far as uh Asian
countries are concerned or African countries are concerned  but there are
some in West Indians 
""
And we also have a  in
uh 
""
So those of you who are interested they could send their papers it
means there are three themes 
""
 on which I am presenting a paper is
the theme of voyage 
""
Uh  this you can take up study one novel or one novelist or one
writer  uh writing in
poetry or fiction
""
For example uh  it could be a voyage in case of one Anita Desai
 uhm outside world into inside world
""
Then she talks of 
""
This is a voyage
""
So voyage can be interpreted 
""
Even this East West encounter is a voyage 
""
So you  don't have to be scared of the theme you can
write anything 
""
This will be in West Indies next year nineteen ninety-two 
""
And uhm  one
word  in Jamaica in
Kingston 
""
Uh 
fellowships in Canadian literature
""
I think most of you know that  at Delhi we have an institute
known as the Shastri 
""
And they give  uh atleast twelve
to teachers of English
""
And these fellowships they 
""
One is the five week fellowship  one is the three four months
fellowship and one is nine months 
""
Uh again 
""
One is those who are persuing there research 
""
Second thing is  that
is senior lecturers who are not to persue any research in Canadian studies
but they would like to be acquainted with the  Canadian literature or
Canadian studies  uh at B A and M A level or
""
""
The so  these uhm five weeks scholarships are for students you
know students in the sense scholars who are working  who are researching
 you know
there is a different caption
""
And also for those 
another is faculty 
""
And four month is again for those  in a
more comprehensive 
""
And nine months is mainly for those  who are persuing their
research in 
""
Uh  and uh uh uh
very good uh  during your stay in Canada
""
""
This is about Canada 
""
Application forms are available 
""
And uh  then third is Australia
""
Australia has not uh 
but uh  ambitious
programme 
Australian 
""
Uhm  come into
operation next year ninety-two 
""
And uh  instituting
fellowships 
""
They are going to set up a centre  Australia
""
""
Similarly Indian Society for Commonwealth studies  of which
professor Pandey is the Chairman 
""
Uh 
centre  of
studies you know 
""
Indo uh 
well both the names are so similar 
""
Their is Australian-Indian 
""
Uh where we set up  uh Australian
government is very helpful  are in
the offing 
""
Apart from that  as far as the availability of books is
concerned  uh Australian government has a very liberal norm in giving
books not to individual but to institutions 
""
And there are certain Universities  which have
been identified as 
research is going on
""
Poona University is one of them 
""
The other Universities 
one is Delhi University  Anantpur
 Poona University is third Bombay University Calcutta University Bangalore
University  uh
these seven eight Universities  then Central University
Hyderabad  these are nine ten Universities I remember
""
Out of the nineteen Universities which have been identified as
centres  Australian literature
and 
""
So if you need some books on Australian literature 
that through 
""
Poona University has just been given some seventy or eighty books
""
""
So from time to time  uh from the
government  and these books are dispatched to
various Universities 
""
So amongst Australian writers 
Patrick White because he is the only 
""
And uh  I think all
novel  by Patrick White they are
available 
""
A lot of fiction is also available 
""
But other writers which are coming up  who
visited Delhi University as a visiting  uhm fellow last year for about
four months 
""
Uh Rodney Hall and  one
word 
""
A lot of work has been done on these writers 
""
I will be very happy if uh we take up  research on these writers
""
""
Uh because I should have been saying so  British literature uh
""
""
So  focus our attention on new literatures
""
""
So if you want uh books on 
Australian  these
institutions 
""
But by next year we are going to have lot of books 
""
Penguin  has got into Australian now some two three
years ago 
""
And they are bringing out a series of books 
""
They are monographs and literary books 
""
Recently they have brought out  forty
to forty-five titles on Australian literature
""
I have some with me 
which is the literary history of  an excellent
book
""
If you were to look at that book  you
get to know everything about Australia 
about aboriginal literature 
""
There is so much common 
""
And uh I am very hopeful by next year I think we are going to have
""
""
So from that we come to 
""
Uh  and
short stories 
both in England  India since ages
""
But drama  came into existence only
very recently
""
This is a recent phenomenon 
""
In England as all of us know  uh the origin of
novel  uhm linked with
Henry Fielding and Richardson 
""
Uh  we always say that it takes about hundred years for a
movement to come to India from England or from Europe or from America 
""
So but in  we have the
first two novels in nineteenth century only 
""
Uhm  there is the controversy which is the first
novel 
""
But we can talk of some first great novels  and one of them is
Chandu 
""
Now when we talk of  different
uh meaning connotation than what when we see novel in England or novel in
Europe or novel in America 
""
Because novel in India is a classic collective expressions 
""
It comprises fiction from all regional literatures
""
We don't have what is Indian literature we  we can not define
Indian literature
""
Indian literature means 
""
Hindi is uh  just now a national language
""
It doesn't have a identity of its own
""
So Hindi could also be termed as only a regional literature
""
So Hindi Urdu Marathi Bengali Punjabi  these are all literatures
and all 
""
So this is a collective expression
""
So when we talk of Indian novel  novel in all
branches 
""
Now  ?
""
In ninteenth century 
""
And uh  middle of that nineteenth century there
was no novel 
""
It is precisely and mainly because of the efforts of  Christian
missionaries 
""
When they came to India 
and since they wanted people  our
languages they learnt  south Indian languages
""
First of all Tamil  these languages they
learnt
""
And they translated the Bible into  of
that time 
""
This is the basic  so if you want to note down the
certain points  uhm novel
 is new to India
""
Now novel you put in double inverted commas 
""
Novel as a  the novel as a literary phenomenon is new to India
""
""
We all know epics 
they've  respectable uhm industries going
back to several centuries 
""
But it is only during the second half of nineteenth century 
that 
""
Now uh  for the novel popularly popularly uh so called we have
to wait till the second half of of nineteenth century 
""
And it is because of uh western impact on  so you can take down
second point is that  because of the western impact on India
""
""
Western impact on 
""
This is because of the western impact that there was a formal
development of prose
""
And I said  that the Christian missionaries they
wanted Indians to read the Bible  so they read our languages and then
they translated the Bible 
""
So that gave a fillip  prose writing in our country
""
And then from the prose medium 
uh 
""
Then third point is write down that  the term novel is a
collective expression
""
These are very important points
""
So once you know these points you can explain them 
""
Novel 
""
It comprises fiction of some length 
regional languages of India  comprises fiction of some length produced in
several regional languages of India 
Marathi 
""
Now  Indian
literary renaissance  with the
establishment of Sir William Fort college  a
printing press in Sarempore by Christian missionaries 
""
They  only
to popularise  Christianity
""
But in the process it also gave fillip to the spread of education
""
""
Now once it became popular  uh
""
uh in south India  when he wrote his novel
""
""
It has been rightly held as a first  first significant novel
 and also of course as a matter of fact in India
""
But there is a controversy because there are so many so many
novels written during those two three decades 
""
So it is the first significant novel 
""
It it was written in nine eighteen hundred eighty-nine  and
published in eighteen-ninety 
""
It faced some controversy you know year this side or that side but
these are the most recognized 
""
Uhm  now one thing we have to keep in mind is that Chandu
Menon was not a professional writer 
""
He was a judge by profession
""
He was a lawyer then judge  and he can be compared for that
matter  and it
was his passtime 
""
He was very fond of company over cup of tea he used to discuss
novels 
""
And uh 
impressed 
""
And uhm  he felt that he should write
a novel 
""
And he was thoroughly impressed by English manners  English
people English language 
""
Uh he was a typical Indian person who was  uh accost to English
culture and since he was in a very high position he was highly impressed by
it 
""
And uhm his wife was also of the same views 
""
And very often she used to exhort him to write a novel 
""
And one of his friends  uh there is a
novel by Disreily  which Henrietta some
Henrietta I remember  uh this is Henrietta
Temple
""
Please just write down the name of the novel 
""
This was written by Benjamin Disreily 
""
 T T
A 
""
This is the name of the novel by Disreily 
""
And his friend asked him to translate the novel
