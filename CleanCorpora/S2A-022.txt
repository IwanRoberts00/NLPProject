<I>
This is the beginning of novels beginnings of novel in
India 
Now before I take up this uh subject there is query from a
colleague of ours from Bombay 
She has uh she is willing to know as to where we can get
material critical material and creative writing on Australian
literature 
Because Australian literature as you know is quite new 
Uh from amongst uh uh Commonwealth literature uh lot of
work is being done in Canadian literature
This is main mainly because 
I am giving you this piece of information uh because there are number
of fellowships and scholarships available for Commonwealth uh studies
And uh not many people are aware of these 
Now uh literatures in Commonwealth again be divided into two
parts one is White one is Black 
In White we have three major literatures Australian 
Canadian and New Zealand 
Uh and in Black you know most of these literatures Nigerian
South African Indian Pakistani and other literatures 
Now there won't be many fellowships in as far as uh Asian
countries are concerned or African countries are concerned but there are
some in West Indians 
And we also have a one word meeting next year in
uh Kingston Jamaica in West Indies 
So those of you who are interested they could send their papers it
means there are three themes 
 I once I remember on which I am presenting a paper is
the theme of voyage theme of flight 
Uh this you can take up study one novel or one novelist or one
writer how she or he has projected this theme in his uh writing in
poetry or fiction
For example uh it could be a voyage in case of one Anita Desai
 Desai from uhm outside world into inside world
Then she talks of you know inner world 
This is a voyage
So voyage can be interpreted in several ways 
Even this East West encounter is a voyage 
So you we don't have to be scared of the theme you can
write anything with voyage as the as the basic modem 
This will be in West Indies next year nineteen ninety-two 
And uhm uh all applications have to be made to at one
word London or the professor in charge there in Jamaica in
Kingston 
Uh apart from that West Indies we have uh 
fellowships in Canadian literature
I think most of you know that at Delhi we have an institute
known as the Shastri uh Institute Institute of Indo-Canadian Studies 
And they give large number of fellowships uh atleast twelve
to teachers of English
And these fellowships they arrange in at three levels 
One is the five week fellowship one is the three four months
fellowship and one is nine months 
Uh again five weeks fellowship is divided into two uh part 
One is those who are persuing there research 
Second thing is uh faculty in recent uh programme that
is senior lecturers who are not to persue any research in Canadian studies
but they would like to be acquainted with the Canadian literature or
Canadian studies and come back and teach uh at B A and M A level or
 as guide for M A M phil or Ph D students 
The so these uhm five weeks scholarships are for students you
know students in the sense scholars who are working who are researching
 for their M Phil Ph D's and also for those you know
there is a different caption
And also for those one is known as uhm study programme 
another is faculty improvement 
And four month is again for those who want to study in a
more comprehensive uh comprehensive fashion 
And nine months is mainly for those who are persuing their
research in uh Canadian literature 
Uh terms are very lucrative both one word and uh uh uh
very good uh amount of payment fellowships during your stay in Canada
This is about Canada 
Application forms are available 
And uh then third is Australia
Australia has not uh instituted any fellowship as yet 
but uh they are they have a very uh uhm uhm ambitious
programme and they have set up as Professor Pandey said the other day 
Australian Indian Council 
Uhm this is just being set up it'll come into
operation next year ninety-two early ninety-two 
And uh under this programme they will be instituting
fellowships 
They are going to set up a centre uh centre for Australia
 India studies 
Similarly Indian Society for Commonwealth studies of which
professor Pandey is the Chairman 
Uh our society is going to set up an Indian centre 
centre which will be known as Indo Australian centre uh of
studies you know 
Indo uh sorry uh centre for Indo-Australian studies 
well both the names are so similar 
Their is Australian-Indian ours is Indo-Australian 
Uh where we set up this only time will tell uh Australian
government is very helpful and fellowships will are in
the offing 
Apart from that as far as the availability of books is
concerned uh Australian government has a very liberal norm in giving
books not to individual but to institutions 
And there are certain Universities cough which have
been identified as the Universities where Commonwealth literature 
research is going on
Poona University is one of them 
The other Universities uh the Universities I know of which 
one is Delhi University one word University of Anantpur
 Poona University is third Bombay University Calcutta University Bangalore
University Mysore University Chandigarh Punjab University uh
these seven eight Universities then Osmania then Central University
Hyderabad these are nine ten Universities I remember
Out of the nineteen Universities which have been identified as
centres uhm which can promote the study of Australian literature
and Commonwealth literature as a whole 
So if you need some books on Australian literature it is 
that through uh get in touch with these uh uhm Universities 
Poona University has just been given some seventy or eighty books
So from time to time they receive books uh from the
government Australian Embassy here and these books are dispatched to
various Universities 
So amongst Australian writers the most popular has been 
Patrick White because he is the only writer who got Nobel Prize 
And uh as far as Patrick White is concerned I think all
novel most of it most of the novels by Patrick White they are
available in India 
A lot of fiction is also available 
But other writers which are coming up like Rodney Hall who
visited Delhi University as a visiting uhm fellow last year for about
four months 
Uh Rodney Hall and Leftmary and uh Judith one
word lot of coach who came to India some three years ago 
A lot of work has been done on these writers 
I will be very happy if uh we take up research on these writers
Uh because I should have been saying so British literature uh
 is any way dying uh even American literature has become stale 
So it's time we focus our attention on new literatures
 which are coming up 
So if you want uh books on Aust 
Australian literature you please get in touch with these
institutions these uh bodies 
But by next year we are going to have lot of books 
Penguin uh has got into Australian now some two three
years ago 
And they are bringing out a series of books 
They are monographs and literary books 
Recently they have brought out no less than I think forty
to forty-five titles on Australian literature
I have some with me uh specially one which is 
which is the literary history of Australia it's an excellent
book
If you were to look at that book if you read that book you
get to know everything about Australia specially about women studies 
about aboriginal literature 
There is so much common between India and Australia 
And uh I am very hopeful by next year I think we are going to have
 many more books 
So from that we come to the beginnings of novel in India 
Uh as all of us you know that drama lyrics and
short stories and other forms of literature they have been there 
both in England in Europe in India India since ages
But drama I am sorry but novel came into existence only
very recently
This is a recent phenomenon 
In England as all of us know the novel uh the origin of
novel or flowering of novel I should say is uh uhm linked with
Henry Fielding and Richardson eighteenth century 
Uh we always say that it takes about hundred years for a
movement to come to India from England or from Europe or from America 
So but in Ind as far as India is concerned we have the
first two novels in nineteenth century only 
Uhm and uh there is the controversy which is the first
novel 
But we can talk of some first great novels and one of them is
Chandu Menon's Indulekha 
Now when we talk of a novel in India it has a different
uh meaning connotation than what when we see novel in England or novel in
Europe or novel in America 
Because novel in India is a classic collective expressions 
It comprises fiction from all regional literatures
We don't have what is Indian literature we we can not define
Indian literature
Indian literature means literatures of all the regions 
Hindi is uh just now a national language
It doesn't have a identity of its own
So Hindi could also be termed as only a regional literature
So Hindi Urdu Marathi Bengali Punjabi these are all literatures
and all put together they form Indian literature 
So this is a collective expression
So when we talk of Indian novel we talk of novel in all
branches uhm in the country 
Now how did it come to flourish ?
In ninteenth century practically there was no novel 
And uh uhm till uh middle of that nineteenth century there
was no novel 
It is precisely and mainly because of the efforts of Christian
missionaries 
When they came to India they wanted people to read Bible 
and since they wanted people to read Bible they learnt our
languages they learnt south Indian languages
First of all Tamil uhm then Malyalam these languages they
learnt
And they translated the Bible into all living languages of
that time 
This is the basic uh so if you want to note down the
certain points you can just say in point number one that uhm novel
 as a literary phenomenon is new to India
Now novel you put in double inverted commas 
Novel as a the novel as a literary phenomenon is new to India
We all know epics lyrics dramas short-stories fables 
they've been they have there uh respectable uhm industries going
back to several centuries 
But it is only during the second half of nineteenth century 
that novel took its root in in India 
Now uh for the novel popularly popularly uh so called we have
to wait till the second half of of nineteenth century 
And it is because of uh western impact on so you can take down
second point is that it's because of the western impact on India
Western impact on India 
This is because of the western impact that there was a formal
development of prose
And I said as I said that the Christian missionaries they
wanted Indians to read the Bible so they read our languages and then
they translated the Bible 
So that gave a fillip to uh prose writing in our country
And then from the prose medium it uh brought into currency 
uh translation and then from a novel the proper 
Then third point is write down that the term novel is a
collective expression
These are very important points
So once you know these points you can explain them 
Novel in India is a collective expression 
It comprises fiction of some length produced in several 
regional languages of India comprises fiction of some length produced in
several regional languages of India like Bengali Hindi Urdu 
Marathi Punjabi etcetera 
Now as you know that it was mainly in Bengal that Indian
literary renaissance took place in nineteenth century with the
establishment of Sir William Fort college and uh setting up of a
printing press in Sarempore by Christian missionaries 
They they of course had motive was only
to popularise Christianity
But in the process it also gave fillip to the spread of education
 and uh specially prose uh writing 
Now once it became popular uh people started writing uh uh
 prose and novels and uh the first attempt which was made 
uh in south India was that of Chandu Menon when he wrote his novel
 Indulekha 
It has been rightly held as a first first significant novel
 in Malyalam and also of course as a matter of fact in India
But there is a controversy because there are so many so many
novels written during those two three decades 
So it is the first significant novel in Malyalam 
It it was written in nine eighteen hundred eighty-nine and
published in eighteen-ninety 
It faced some controversy you know year this side or that side but
these are the most recognized dates 
Uhm now one thing we have to keep in mind is that Chandu
Menon was not a professional writer 
He was a judge by profession
He was a lawyer then judge and he can be compared for that
matter with Henry Fielding who was a lawyer and then a judge and it
was his passtime 
He was very fond of company over cup of tea he used to discuss
novels 
And uh he was greatly impre 
impressed by English novels 
And uhm very often he uh he felt that he should write
a novel 
And he was thoroughly impressed by English manners English
people English language 
Uh he was a typical Indian person who was uh accost to English
culture and since he was in a very high position he was highly impressed by
it cough 
And uhm his wife was also of the same views 
And very often she used to exhort him to write a novel 
And one of his friends he uh suggested that uh there is a
novel by Disreily and the name of the novel was which Henrietta some
Henrietta I remember uh he wanted him to uh this is Henrietta
Temple
Please just write down the name of the novel 
This was written by Benjamin Disreily 
 Henrietta's spellings are H E N H E N R I E T T
A Henrietta Temple 
This is the name of the novel by Disreily 
And his friend asked him to translate the novel
