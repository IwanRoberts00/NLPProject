Friends today I'm going to talk to you about two
dimensional stratagrowth by identical limited aggregation by
electrolysts deposit process 
The passing century has witnessed scientific investigation
 of order systems such as crystalline systems and so on and
so forth 
Order was even discovered in liquids like liquid systems 
But during the last part of this century scientists have
realised that many recorded systems behave in perfectly orderly 
manner 
For example biological systems are never crystalline and
they contain more than seventy percent water and yet they perform
functions which are most orderly 
Many physical technological and biological systems 
have been shown to be related to and described by non-integer
dimension as called fractional dim fractional
dimensions 
A concept which was originally uh discovered and
beautifully demonstrated by B B Mendel Broad in his classic book
called Fractal 
Uh lot of information has been gathered about these systems
 such as technique such as experimental theoritical and computer
assimilation 
In this lecture today I'm going to introduce you 
to a process of generating fractal aggregate that is
developed in our laboratory 
The plan of my lecture will be as follows 
Although most of you must be familiar with the fla
fact factual concepts 
For the benefit of those who are uninitiated in this field and
for the sake of completness 
 I'll first give an introduction to the concepts of 
fractal such as definition of fractal the concept of
self similarity and their invariance the physical significance of
 fractal dimension and so forth 
Before going over to the method of generating fractal
 that we have developed 
And since the aggregates that we obtain are diffusion
limited aggregate I'll introduce the diffusion limited
aggregation of with an nth standard the module which is developed by
with an nth standard 
The first experimental uh evidence of different type of aggregates
 was given by electro deposition process by Sauda Atoll and Gregor
Atoll 
Whereas the method which we have developed is electroless
deposition 
And using this technique we have generated aggregates of
metals like copper silver and zinc which will be compared
and contrasted 
 I'll also show a method of how to measure the 
fractal dimension experimentally for the agre type of
aggregates that we have generated 
The diffusion limited aggregation is aggregates are formed
 by uh interspin which are very near to equilibrium 
I mean very far from equilibrium 
Whereas when the crystals are very near to equilibrium the
morphology of aggregates is entirely different 
 I'll give some beautiful examples of diffusionless
aggregates which are generated in our laboratory from crystals 
which are very near to the equilibrium 
 Fractal geometry provides a natural framework for
describing and understanding those form this according to Euclidian
geometry are formulae that is to investigate the morphology of amorphous
Now how to describe fractions 
 Frac in general if you observe a particular object for
example take a glass of water and a bucket of water where the
mass per unit volume which tells you about the density of water does
not depend upon the volume of water gratitute for measurements 
Whether you take a glass or you take a bucket the density
of the water will remain one 
So in Euclidian type of object the density remains constant
 irrespective of type of the measuring unit 
But if you consider some different object as I'll
 show here then the density no longer ramains constant as the
size of the object 
This object is generated in this particular case by well
defined determinous to prove 
A cross is generated by putting four particle around the
central particle and this is used as a iterative unit 
At the four corners and at the centre you replace every
particle by the cross and you will generate this figure 
And if this process is repeated several times then
 a figure such as this is obtained 
Now let us try to calculate the density of this object 
Or as you've seen here since density can be
written as density can be written as mass upon volume 
So we can write this equation as mass is proportional to volume
 that is mass is proportional to length cube 
And in two dimensions mass will be proportional to length
square 
Now instead of mass we can use the number of particles as unit
because number of particles will be proportional to the mass of the 
uh one word 
So number of particles in Euclidian system is proportional
to the linear dimension to the power of Euclidian dimension 
For the sake of simplicity we are considering a two dimensional
system 
And as you can see here in this particular system 
Here value is at K 
K is any number if this is K is equal to one
Ah
I have okay I'll just put it up here 
So you have K is equal to zero K is equal to one K is equal to
two and K is equal to some number K let us say cough 
And I'll show you how it is obtained 
So you will have here for K is equal to one you have five
particles in this particular figure 
So your N is five 
For K is equal to two you have twenty-five particles as
you can see there 
So your N is five twelve 
And so your K is equal to K and N is five to power of
K 
Similarly if you take the linear dimension that is if you
measure this distance then for K is equal to one simply K into
three that is three times K this and I have not drawn it properly 
If you look at that figure you will see that this plus this plus
this will give you this for K is equal to one two and
three 
So for K is equal to two we have K into T to the power of
two 
You can count here 
It will give about nine distance three plus three plus
three 
And for K is equal to K cough we have K into three to
the power of K 
So in this equation if you have log of N divided by
log of N to the limit A going to infinity then you find that
this comes out to be log of five divided by log of N using one
point four six five 
So you see that the power of the I mean if you cough
 can rewrite this equation it will become N into number of one
word S to the power of some constant number 
But A is unit here 
Right A is uh you can take it uniquely or you can know
even if you write A and solve the equation we get this in the limit A
tending to infinity 
So we find that this number comes out to be a 
fractional number 
So for Euclidian object you have a proportional to L to
the power of Euclidian dimension and for a fractal object this is a
fractional number and because it is a fractional number it is called
 a fractal system 
This word fractal was coined by B B Mendel Broad to represent
those system which occurs the physical properties cannot be described
 by using Euclidian dimension 
For example if you take a mountain you cannot call it a
triangle you cannot call it a sphere and therefore its
properties will not be describable by Euclidian geometry 
You need to take some other measure to describe the properties
of such systems which are plenty in nature 
Uh blood circulation system or nervous system so many systems if
you look at them you cannot put them into orderly phenomenon 
And then you require some science to describe such systems because
the aim of science is to bring predictibility to events 
If you cannot predict than naturally you can't have some
 uh good sign you can't predict certain things then it's not
science 
So in order to bring predictability you need a framework which
will describe the image 
So fractal framework produce a provides something
 which with which you can describe these events with certainity
Now we should understand that there is this dimension 
which is used and if we call as one point four six five is the dimension
of the system but that is not the real dimension of the system
Really it is a two dimensional system as you can see there 
This term fra dimension is borrowed because that
particular number replaces the dimension in the Eucli normal
 uh equation 
So we call a fractal dimension 
It is not a dimension in the actual sense of the word 
It is but because this fractional number replaces the dimension of
the system to make the mea physical measurements meaningful
 we call it a dimension 
So when the notion of Euclid and dimension poses a conceptual
problem in underst understanding 
certain system the concept of fractal dimensionality gives a
manageable and convenient answer to such questions 
Just for the sake of completeness I'll give some
mathematical equation which should not put you off 
So in general if rover is the density of the aggregate
at a point R and N is the total number of particles in a cluster of
radius I then the density density correlation
function can be written as here 
So you have several forms of of this
equation which I have written there is simple form U is equal to M upon V
 C R can be written as R to the power of minus three minus three that E
is the Euclidian dimension and this D is the fractal dimension 
If this number is written as alpha then you have C R 
varying as R to the power of minus alpha and fractal dimension can
be measured experimentally by using any one of these cough 
equations when different techniques are required for such
measurements 
Now I will describe the concepts of self similarity and 
scale invariance of the fractal 
Self similarity and scale invariance are the fundamental
properties of fractal
I don't say that scale invariance is fundamental because there are
fractal in which the scale invariance is not necessary in the sense 
the power which we saw just now this D distance need not
be a constant number 
It can be expressed as a power T and those fractal are called
multifractal okay the common fractal normally I mean to be
conceptually very simple the scale invariance and scale
similarity are considered to be two important characteristics of
the fractal 
So in this figure which we have generated just sometime before 
If you take any part of this figure and enlarge it then
you get a figure which is identical to the start 
 starting figure 
And then again take any part of it so I have put it 
Then again enlarge a part of this figure 
It will appear identical to the original figure 
And that is why the fractal systems are called self-similar
 because the a any part of the system if it is elarged
or contracted looks like the original system 
But this self similarity ends when you start distinguishing
between the particles 
When you start seeing the particle from this take a small part of
it and enlarge it it is no longer going to look like the like 
original figure 
And so this puts a blow to critical form below which the
system will not behave as a fractal system
Figures might be same
No it is it is no longer a fractal system then 
And similarly the size of the aggregate itself puts a
bound above which the system cannot be called as a fractal system
Because I may have a large system with sub units like this
Now each sub unit is a fractal but these sub units might be
arranged in crystalline position 
So in that case I have fractal behaviour only between 
the size of the particle and the size of the aggregate which is fractal
In between these two units the aggregate behave like fractal
 but above and below these limit they do not behave like fractal 
And these are called the lower and upper critical bounds of
the fractal system 
Now in this particular case the figure has been generated using a
 precise deterministic mathematical rule 
But in general we make a fractal which exist are not
created by mathematical rules 
So in that case the self similarity is not exact 
It is a statistical self similarity 
As we can see here the object which are created for example
by some processes like the smoke are self similar and here again
 if you enlarge a small part anywhere here it will look similar
to the starting object it will not be exactly identical to the starting
object and yet it will be similar to the starting object 
 It's statistical properties will be similar to what
you have from the original object until and unless you start resolving
between the particles when again the self similarity breaks down 
So you have statistical or deterministic factors which
are self similar 
So let us see what is scale invariance of statistic 
The equation M is proportional to L to the power of D sixth
off the scale invariance because the in this equation it all remains
constant 
But the question we comes at to in this equation Euclidian
 where Euclidian is dimension is used also this power remain constant 
So what is so great about the invariance of fraction 
In order system also you have scale invariance 
This the importance of scale invariance becomes clear 
when we look at it from the other side 
What I mean by other side is that is if you have objects for
which for the measurement of which mathematical equation cannot be
written down
You cannot define it 
Then you cannot define if that means they are not still
invariant whereas for those objects for which you can give some
meaning to the one word are only objects which are scale
invariant 
I will give a very specific example of a coastland 
We have all visited beaches that is sea beach I mean 
And if you'll see the morphology of the sea beach 
you will find it something like this it's not going to be a
straight line 
Now I'll take a one kilometre strip of the coastline
This is one kilometre 
And I measure this one kilometre length by using a metre
long scale 
I keep my metre long scale here and start measuring this by
kilometre length 
I find that my coastline length of my coastline is
thirty-two kilometres 
Then I take a one metre uh sorry one centimetre uh strip
 and again measure this coast length 
Again here there will be something 
So I measure the length of the coastline as three into ten to the
power of seven kilometres 
And if I take one millimetre it becomes ten to the power of
nine kilometres 
There it appears as if it is not possible to measure the length of
the coastline because depending on what unit I take for measurement it
keeps on varying 
But that is not true because the including coastline can be
 statistically defined
It cannot be exactly defined but length of the coastline can
be statistically defined by an equation saying a few words 
if we put one metre one centimetre or one millimetre you will get
 L exactly predictable
