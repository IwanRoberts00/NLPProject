Friends  going to talk to you about two
""
""
""
""
 and so on and
""
""
Order was even 
""
But during the last part of this century  scientists have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A concept which was originally  and
""
""
""
""
""
assimilation 
""
In this lecture today 
""
""
""
""
""
Although most of you must be  fla
""
""
For the benefit of those who are uninitiated in this field  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And since  diffusion
""
aggregation of  with an nth standard the module which is developed by
with an nth standard 
""
""
 by Sauda Atoll and Gregor
Atoll 
""
Whereas the method which we have developed is  electroless
""
""
""
""
and contrasted 
""
""
fractal  type of
aggregates that we have generated 
""
The diffusion limited aggregation is  aggregates are formed
""
""
I mean very far from equilibrium 
""
""
""
""
""
aggregates 
""
""
 a natural framework for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
mass per unit volume  does
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A cross is generated by putting  around the
central particle 
""
At the four corners  you replace every
particle by the cross 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
system 
""
And as you can see here 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
particles 
""
So your N is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So for K is equal to  we have K into T to the power of
""
""
""
""
It will give about nine distance  plus
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So you see that  cough
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we find that 
fractional number 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
triangle  and therefore its
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So in order to bring predictability you need a framework  which
will describe the image 
""
So fractal framework  something
""
""
""
""
""
of the system  but that is not the real dimension of the system
""
Really it is a two dimensional system as you can see there 
""
""
""
""
""
So we call a fractal dimension 
""
It is not 
""
It is but because this fractional number replaces the dimension of
the system  physical measurements meaningful
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
radius I  correlation
""
""
So you have several forms  this
""
 C R can be written as R to the power of minus three minus three that E
""
""
If this number is written as alpha 
""
be measured 
""
measurements 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I don't say that scale invariance is fundamental because there are
""
the power which we saw just now  need not
be a constant number 
""
It can be expressed as a power T  and those fractal are called
""
conceptually very  scale
similarity  of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then again take any part of it 
""
Then again enlarge a part of this figure 
""
It will appear identical to the original figure 
""
""
 any part of the system if it is elarged
or contracted 
""
""
between the particles 
""
""
it and enlarge it it is no longer going to look like the 
original figure 
""
""
system will not behave as a fractal system
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
arranged in crystalline position 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And these are called the lower and upper critical bounds  of
""
""
""
""
""
""
created by mathematical rules 
""
""
""
""
""
""
by some processes  and here again
""
to the starting object  it will not be exactly identical to the starting
""
""
""
you have from the original object  until and unless you start resolving
""
""
""
are self similar 
""
So let us see what is scale invariance of statistic 
""
""
off the scale invariance because  in this equation it all remains
constant 
""
""
""
""
So what is so great about the invariance of fraction 
""
""
""
This 
""
""
""
which  mathematical equation cannot be
""
""
You cannot define it 
""
""
""
""
invariant 
""
I will give a very specific example 
""
We have all visited beaches 
""
And if 
""
straight line 
""
Now  the coastline
""
""
This is one kilometre 
""
""
long scale 
""
I keep my metre long scale here  and start measuring this by
""
""
I find that  length of my coastline is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I measure the length of the coastline as three into ten to the
""
""
And if I take one millimetre it becomes  ten to the power of
""
""
There it appears as if it is not possible to measure the length of
the coastline because depending on what  unit I take for measurement it
""
""
But that is not true  because the including coastline can be
""
""
It cannot be exactly defined  but length of the coastline can
""
""
""
