Friends  going to talk to you about two
dimensional stratagrowth by identical limited aggregation  by
electrolysts deposit process 
""
The passing century  scientific investigation
 and so on and
so forth 
""
Order was even 
""
But during the last part of this century  scientists have
realised 
manner 
""
For example  and
they contain more than seventy percent water  they perform
functions 
""
Many physical 
have been shown to be related to  non-integer
dimension  fractional
dimensions 
""
A concept which was originally  and
beautifully demonstrated by  in his classic book
called 
""
Uh lot of information has been gathered about  these systems
 technique such as experimental theoritical and computer
assimilation 
""
In this lecture today 
to a  that is
developed in our 
""
The plan of my lecture 
""
Although most of you must be  fla
fact 
""
For the benefit of those who are uninitiated in this field  and
for the sake of completness 
""
""
fractal  the concept of
self similarity and  the physical significance of
""
""
Before going over to the  fractal
""
""
And since  diffusion
limited aggregate  introduce the diffusion limited
aggregation of  with an nth standard the module which is developed by
with an nth standard 
""
The first experimental uh evidence of different type of aggregates
 by Sauda Atoll and Gregor
Atoll 
""
Whereas the method which we have developed is  electroless
deposition 
""
And using this technique  we have generated aggregates of
metals  which will be compared
and contrasted 
""
""
fractal  type of
aggregates that we have generated 
""
The diffusion limited aggregation is  aggregates are formed
""
""
I mean very far from equilibrium 
""
Whereas when the crystals are very near to equilibrium  the
morphology of aggregates is entirely different 
""
 diffusionless
aggregates 
which are very near to the equilibrium 
""
 a natural framework for
describing and understanding those form  this according to Euclidian
geometry are formulae  that is to investigate the morphology of amorphous
""
""
Now how to describe fractions 
""
 in general if you observe a particular object for
example take a  where the
mass per unit volume  does
not depend upon 
""
Whether you take a glass  the density
of the water 
""
So in Euclidian type of object  the density remains constant
""
""
But  I'll
 as the
size of the object 
""
This  by well
defined determinous to prove 
""
A cross is generated by putting  around the
central particle 
""
At the four corners  you replace every
particle by the cross 
""
And if this process  then
""
""
Now let us try to calculate the density of this object 
""
Or  since density can be
written as 
""
So we can write this equation as  mass is proportional to volume
""
""
And in two dimensions  length
square 
""
Now instead of mass we can use the number of particles as unit
because 
uh 
""
So number of particles  is proportional
to the 
""
For the sake of simplicity we are considering a two dimensional
system 
""
And as you can see here 
""
""
Here value is at K 
""
""
K is any number  K is equal to one
""
""
Ah
""
""
I have 
""
So you have K is equal to zero K is equal to one  K is equal to
two 
""
And 
""
So you will have  you have five
particles 
""
So your N is 
""
For K is equal to two  as
you can see there 
""
So your N is 
""
And so  and N is five to power of
K 
""
Similarly  if you take the linear dimension that is if you
measure this  simply K into
three 
""
If you look at that figure you will see that this plus this plus
this  and
three 
""
So for K is equal to  we have K into T to the power of
two 
""
You can count here 
""
It will give about nine distance  plus
three 
""
And for K is equal to K  we have K into three to
the power of K 
""
So  divided by
log of  then you find that
this comes out to be  using one
point 
""
So you see that  cough
 one
word 
""
""
But A is unit here 
""
""
Right  you can take it uniquely or you can know
even if you write A  and solve the equation we get this in the limit A
tending to infinity 
""
So we find that 
fractional number 
""
So  you have a proportional to L to
the power of Euclidian dimension  this is a
fractional number  it is called
""
""
This word fractal was coined by  B B Mendel Broad to represent
those system  which occurs the physical properties cannot be described
""
""
For example if you take a mountain  you cannot call it a
triangle  and therefore its
properties 
""
You need to take some other measure  to describe the properties
of such systems 
""
Uh blood circulation system or nervous system so many systems if
you look at them 
""
And then you require some science to describe such systems because
the aim of science is to bring predictibility to events 
""
If you cannot predict  have some
 not
science 
""
So in order to bring predictability you need a framework  which
will describe the image 
""
So fractal framework  something
 certainity
""
""
Now 
which is used  and if we call as one point four six five is the dimension
of the system  but that is not the real dimension of the system
""
Really it is a two dimensional system as you can see there 
""
This term  that
particular number replaces the dimension  normal
""
""
So we call a fractal dimension 
""
It is not 
""
It is but because this fractional number replaces the dimension of
the system  physical measurements meaningful
""
""
So when the notion of Euclid and dimension poses a conceptual
problem 
certain system  gives a
manageable and convenient answer 
""
Just for the sake of  give some
mathematical equation which should not put you off 
""
So in general  is the density of the aggregate
at a point R  and N is the total number of particles in a cluster of
radius I  correlation
function can be written as 
""
So you have several forms  this
equation  which I have written there is simple form U is equal to M upon V
 C R can be written as R to the power of minus three minus three that E
is the Euclidian dimension and 
""
If this number is written as alpha 
varying as R to the power of  and fractal dimension can
be measured 
equations  such
measurements 
""
Now I will describe the 
scale invariance 
""
Self similarity and scale invariance are  the fundamental
properties of fractal
""
I don't say that scale invariance is fundamental because there are
fractal 
the power which we saw just now  need not
be a constant number 
""
It can be expressed as a power T  and those fractal are called
multifractal  to be
conceptually very  scale
similarity  of
the 
""
So in this figure which we have generated just sometime before 
""
If you take any part of this figure  then
you get 
""
""
And then again take any part of it 
""
Then again enlarge a part of this figure 
""
It will appear identical to the original figure 
""
And that is why  self-similar
 any part of the system if it is elarged
or contracted 
""
But this self similarity ends  when you start distinguishing
between the particles 
""
When you start seeing the particle from this take a small part of
it and enlarge it it is no longer going to look like the 
original figure 
""
And so this puts a blow to critical form  below which the
system will not behave as a fractal system
""
""
Figures might be same
""
""
No 
""
And similarly  puts a
bound  the system cannot be called as a fractal system
""
""
Because I may have a large system  with sub units like this
""
""
Now each sub unit is a fractal  but these sub units might be
arranged in crystalline position 
""
So in that case 
the size of the particle  and the size of the aggregate which is fractal
""
""
In between these two units  the aggregate behave like fractal
""
""
And these are called the lower and upper critical bounds  of
the fractal system 
""
Now in this particular case the figure has been generated using a
""
""
But in general  are not
created by mathematical rules 
""
So in that case 
""
It is a statistical self similarity 
""
As we can see here  the object which are created for example
by some processes  and here again
 it will look similar
to the starting object  it will not be exactly identical to the starting
object 
""
 similar to what
you have from the original object  until and unless you start resolving
between the particles 
""
So you have statistical  which
are self similar 
""
So let us see what is scale invariance of statistic 
""
The equation M is proportional to L to the power of D  sixth
off the scale invariance because  in this equation it all remains
constant 
""
But the question  Euclidian
""
""
So what is so great about the invariance of fraction 
""
In order system also you have scale invariance 
""
This 
when we look at it from the 
""
What I mean by other side is  that is if you have objects for
which  mathematical equation cannot be
written down
""
You cannot define it 
""
Then  you cannot define if that means they are not still
invariant  you can give some
meaning to the  are only objects which are scale
invariant 
""
I will give a very specific example 
""
We have all visited beaches 
""
And if 
you will find it something like  not going to be a
straight line 
""
Now  the coastline
""
""
This is one kilometre 
""
And  by using a metre
long scale 
""
I keep my metre long scale here  and start measuring this by
kilometre 
""
I find that  length of my coastline is
thirty-two kilometres 
""
Then I take a one metre  strip
""
""
Again here there will be something 
""
So I measure the length of the coastline as three into ten to the
power of seven kilometres 
""
And if I take one millimetre it becomes  ten to the power of
nine kilometres 
""
There it appears as if it is not possible to measure the length of
the coastline because depending on what  unit I take for measurement it
keeps on varying 
""
But that is not true  because the including coastline can be
 statistically defined
""
It cannot be exactly defined  but length of the coastline can
be statistically defined 
if we put  you will get
""
