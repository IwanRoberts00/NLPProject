I am Malini Bhattacharya 
""
""
I am Anita working as a language assistant in C I I L 
""
""
How do you like Mysore 
""
""
""
""
""
Don't you miss your home 
""
""
I stayed two years in Hyderabad so  I got adjusted to
hostel life and didn't miss it but 
""
Here I miss  my friends in Hyderabad
""
""
Don't you have friends here 
""
""
I do have but  the close ones I miss I can't say I don't
have friends
""
What about you how do you like Mysore 
""
""
Okay the climate is nice the place is nice but even the same
case with me also 
""
But otherwise how is it
""
How is the place 
""
""
Quite good  isn't it
""
How do you feel
""
""
Okay fine did you go around Mysore 
""
""
Not much 
it's  so many we get less time you have a little socialising to do and
then on 
""
Not much but okay 
""
I have been to a few places and  uh and the remaining few I plan
to see later 
""
How about you 
""
""
Uh I have been to  places
like that 
""
I went to Chamundi Hills 
""
Okay it was nice 
I think it takes some time to get used to my work also
""
""
Yeah
""
""
How do you like the work 
""
""
Okay isn't it
""
Quite challenging
""
""
Well 
""
""
I do find it interesting I hope  also find it
interesting 
""
What about this weekend 
""
""
Nothing as such 
""
Maybe I will go to city 
""
""
How about going to Ooty some day 
""
""
How far is it from here 
""
""
Uh its  as far as my knowledge goes its around one fifty
kilometres 
""
""
So how many hours it will take 
""
""
By bus 
""
It should be actually around four but since you have the mountain
routes and the  say not more than
""
""
""
I have no idea actually but uh  is the journey comfortable
by bus 
""
""
Or  I suppose the project people all of us could hire a
vehicle and go
""
""
Would that uh
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Would that  be very nice
""
""
I mean it depends on what  uh all of us agree upon isn't
it 
""
""
Yeah then you have to talk to everybody and decide about
""
""
Yeah and uh
""
""
But before that uh for the weekend we can plan something and
go somewhere no 
""
Spend some time outside atleast 
""
""
Uh not this week
""
Actually uh 
place in 
""
I am planning to leave Saturday morning and be  I'll
""
""
What about you
""
What are you planning to do since 
""
""
Then  because
""
""
Okay somebody  somebody else is there
I can  and have some good food
""
""
Have you ever been to Ooty 
""
""
I went when I was very young like a child almost  so I
don't remember anything clearly 
""
""
I went just uh  this year around June
""
""
""
""
Yeah I heard so 
""
""
Yeah and I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
That is the main 
laughs 
""
""
So how do you find the difference from Hyderabad
""
Do you find any different 
""
And you have been in Calcutta also 
""
""
Yeah  say Mysore or
Hyderabad 
""
""
Not with the city 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
I found Calcutta very lively city
""
""
Yeah  like which do you prefer
""
""
""
""
No I am basically from Calcutta so I would like to  uh stay
in Calcutta
""
""
No but you spent most of your uh 
""
""
Actually 
""
""
 Siligudi isn't it
""
""
Yeah but we were forced to stay in Siligudi because my parents
were working there
""
But nobody actually liked the place much because  we used to
miss our home our friends  because everybody
was in Calcutta
""
""
But how many years uh 
""
""
I was there after my birth I spend some  four five years in
Calcutta when I was in  uh Siligudi
""
""
That means the entire span
""
""
School life I spent there 
""
""
But still you have  no liking for the place
""
""
I don't have really I found it a bit boring 
""
""
Is it 
""
""
I like the place and the activities in Calcutta
""
And Calcutta somehow 
it's 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah it is different 
""
You can do something or the other and keep yourself busy
""
""
Busy 
""
""
""
""
Compare to that even Hyderabad I don't like so much
""
But okay  in Hyderabad I had the friend circle
""
""
Yeah  we slowly develop
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We could  well
""
""
Did you watch the match on T V today  uh yesterday
""
""
No I couldn't because I was still in the office  and this
is what I miss 
""
I think I should get one 
laughs 
""
""
But  so disgusting everytime the team keeps
losing I mean 
""
""
There is 
""
""
 somewhere
""
""
Something is wrong with the  Indian team
""
""
I think they don't have that uh  team spirit or something
""
""
""
""
""
Team spirit 
""
""
Because uh
""
""
I mean and  why they keep losing
""
""
Yeah initially  they
had problem with all the captains like  when Kapil was the captain they
had problems
""
""
""
""
""
They had
""
""
Then other 
""
Now they can't possibly blame Tendulkar because he is doing a very
good job
""
""
Very good job 
""
""
But still  there must be something
wrong with them  like whole team
""
""
 all of them got together and did
something about it instead of losing each and every match 
""
""
We just look forward to those eleven to do something for that
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
So you are interested in cricket also
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
What else 
""
""
Uh  I haven't played cricket really in the formal sense
""
""
In college we had a ground where  sometimes we used to put on
gloveses for the heck of saying we were playing cricket 
""
In fact the right pose I mean the boy used to carry the bat also
was never  but okay we picked up on our own
""
But I uh  Badminton I love the game
""
""
""
And what about uh  books and music and how do you keep
yourself busy  in leisure time
""
""
I read lots of books 
""
""
You know both the languages  edge like
 uh you know Telugu and Bangla both
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So which books you prefer reading 
""
""
Telugu and Bangla  I am more comfortable in Bangla
""
Frankly speaking I haven't read any book in Telugu
""
""
I see 
""
""
So
""
""
So  famous poems are coming out
now on
""
""
I 
""
""
You have a very famous uh feminist  like
Jayprabha and all 
""
""
No I haven't 
""
I have gone through but I didn't understand 
""
""
I see  somehow I read some of the translated poems of
Jayprabha and I like them a lot
""
""
Yeah but its sequence are not understanding if you went
through it in Telugu
""
""
True
""
""
Because  limited and the
 how much of vocabulary can you get
at home 
""
""
I understand 
""
""
Outside it was entirely different 
""
No I didn't  but I can
converse and 
""
""
 you write to your parents which
language you write in 
""
""
To my father English  to my
grandparents Telugu  aunt Telugu
""
""
So you know the written variety of Telugu also 
""
""
The written varieties I write down what I speak  that
should not be 
""
""
But don't you find any difference between the  okay
letter writing would be uh  it
won't be exactly spoken variety  of a language
""
""
That I have picked up to some extent with the replies I keep
getting from whoever 
""
""
""
""
""
No 
""
""
Till your M A 
""
""
So with my 
""
""
Okay
""
""
I 
""
""
So don't you find it very  you
being a Telugu uh  using another language and more comfortable in another
language which is not your mother tongue
""
So how do you feel
""
How do you take it
""
""
Uh  one word
""
""
Uh I  haven't thought about this
""
Actually from childhood only I was brought up in the same
atmosphere  like if Papa still has shifted to another place I would have
got the feeling of  not having comfortable in a particular language but on
the whole I think it doesn't matter exactly  how we go about chosing or
selecting a language 
""
""
So you are really an Indian 
""
""
Thank you 
""
What about today evening 
""
""
Okay we might go somewhere no 
""
Because if sitting here and uh 
doing nothing is very boring
""
""
""
""
""
You are really getting boring  and uh as
far as when I haven't yet started my work 
""
""
""
""
""
Even I haven't because I just joined  and I have to know
like what exactly I am supposed to do
""
I have got an idea but uh
""
""
Yeah 
""
No but that is uh 
""
""
Even uh okay even after office hours  like no what else
 and so we can go somewhere else
""
""
""
""
""
Make the evening enjoyable 
""
So we can go somewhere to eat  perhaps
 like it
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
I am thinking about  I
mean not all the time  so
""
""
Okay I am  to some extent
""
""
We are usually blamed because 
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Don't talk about like this 
""
""
""
Seventy-five percent of  income is spent on food
""
""
But don't you ever notice once like we had a teacher in 
uh Hyderabad University who used to say like  uh for breakfast you should
come to south  lunch okay you can go anywhere but the
snacks you should go to Calcutta 
""
Because I think she not only  you can't get
any where else
""
""
No I remember 
see you don't get it anywhere  beside say West
Bengal in general
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
And famous  of course
""
""
""
""
""
You can't get it anywhere else 
""
""
I don't think 
person who would have not tasted it 
""
Are you crazy for sweet 
""
""
""
""
""
Not exactly but uh  Calcutta sweets I think they do have
a little flavour  and that I haven't got anywhere in India
""
""
Yeah 
""
But I tend to be very crazy for sweets than chocolates so 
""
""
""
""
I don't like quantity but  quality should be there
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So whatever it is whichever country whatever preparations I
don't mind  tasting good
""
""
Yeah tasty
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah I enjoy it 
""
""
Uh  so lousy
""
""
It was not Chinese  because the Chinese they never put
sugar in Chao min 
""
""
Yes sugar in Chao min  they put tomato
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I mean  I could have made a better preparation
""
""
""
""
Half of the people don't know how to cook 
""
""
 how to cook
""
""
And you should go  Chinese
restaurant
""
""
 you have lots of these Chinese
restaurants in Calcutta while 
in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
the people  mostly
""
""
No 
""
""
I haven't seen people uh  going for other dishes
""
""
No  the percentage of
people who spent money on  is comparatively less
""
""
Even I suppose the Punjabis and uh  do
go in for all this stuff
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah they do
