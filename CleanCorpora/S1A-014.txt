<I>
I am Malini Bhattacharya 
I am Anita working as a language assistant in C I I L 
How do you like Mysore 
 It's okay I miss my friends in Hyderabad 
Don't you miss your home 
I stayed two years in Hyderabad so I got adjusted to
hostel life and didn't miss it but 
Here I miss my friends in Hyderabad
Don't you have friends here 
I do have but the close ones I miss I can't say I don't
have friends
What about you how do you like Mysore 
Okay the climate is nice the place is nice but even the same
case with me also I do miss home and do miss my friends 
But otherwise how is it
How is the place 
Quite good isn't it
How do you feel
Okay fine did you go around Mysore 
Not much uh you see we have such busy schedules 
it's so many we get less time you have a little socialising to do and
then on one word so 
Not much but okay 
I have been to a few places and uh and the remaining few I plan
to see later 
How about you 
Uh I have been to the Palace and spaces uh places
like that 
I went to Chamundi Hills 
Okay it was nice and I joined here much later than you so 
I think it takes some time to get used to my work also
Yeah
How do you like the work 
Okay isn't it
Quite challenging
Well 
I do find it interesting I hope you'll also find it
interesting 
What about this weekend what are you planning to do 
Nothing as such 
Maybe I will go to city see how it is how life is here 
How about going to Ooty some day 
How far is it from here 
Uh its as far as my knowledge goes its around one fifty
kilometres 
So how many hours it will take 
By bus not more than six hours 
It should be actually around four but since you have the mountain
routes and the one word it will come around say not more than
 six hours am I wrong 
I have no idea actually but uh is the journey comfortable
by bus 
Or I suppose the project people all of us could hire a
vehicle and go
Would that uh
Yeah one word 
Would that be very nice
I mean it depends on what uh all of us agree upon isn't
it 
Yeah then you have to talk to everybody and decide about
Yeah and uh
But before that uh for the weekend we can plan something and
go somewhere no 
Spend some time outside atleast away from your work 
Uh not this week
Actually uh this week I am going down to the friend's 
place in uh Bangalore 
I am planning to leave Saturday morning and be and I'll
 be coming back around uh say Sunday evening 
What about you
What are you planning to do since I'll not be around 
Then I'll have to look for somebody else because
 laugh I still don't know many people around 
Okay somebody else's some somebody else is there
I can go to city atleast and have some good food
Have you ever been to Ooty 
I went when I was very young like a child almost so I
don't remember anything clearly 
I went just uh this year around June
 It's a one word place 
Yeah I heard so 
Yeah and I
 It's a nice place for honeymoon couples 
 One word 
Uh laughs 
That is the main you're one word to go there 
laughs 
So how do you find the difference from Hyderabad
Do you find any different 
And you have been in Calcutta also 
Yeah I loved Calcutta better than say Mysore or
Hyderabad that's because uh attachment to the family 
Not with the city 
Uh it's both laughs 
 It's attachment with the place 
 How do you find it there 
I found Calcutta very lively city
Yeah like which do you prefer
 It's Calcutta or Siligudi 
No I am basically from Calcutta so I would like to uh stay
in Calcutta
No but you spent most of your uh 
Actually when I was 
 You were in Siligudi isn't it
Yeah but we were forced to stay in Siligudi because my parents
were working there
But nobody actually liked the place much because we used to
miss our home our friends uh relatives everybody because everybody
was in Calcutta
But how many years uh you were in Siligudi 
I was there after my birth I spend some four five years in
Calcutta when I was in uh Siligudi
That means the entire span
School life I spent there 
But still you have no liking for the place
I don't have really I found it a bit boring 
Is it 
I like the place and the activities in Calcutta
And Calcutta somehow like wherever you go in India 
it's different 
 Yeah I mean it's it's city of joy 
Yeah it is different 
You can do something or the other and keep yourself busy
Busy 
 That's how it is 
Compare to that even Hyderabad I don't like so much
But okay in Hyderabad I had the friend circle
Yeah so we slowly develop
 So 
 A few words 
We could make the place enjoyable well
Did you watch the match on T V today uh yesterday
No I couldn't because I was still in the office and this
is what I miss 
I think I should get one pocket radio or something 
laughs 
But it's so disgusting everytime the team keeps
losing I mean something should be done isn't it 
There is something wrong over yeah 
 Something is going wrong somewhere
Something is wrong with the yeah Indian team
I think they don't have that uh team spirit or something
 Yeah 
Team spirit that's lacking 
Because uh
I mean and that's why they keep losing
Yeah initially we had problem with uh they
had problem with all the captains like when Kapil was the captain they
had problems
 Very badly 
They had
Then other who became the captain they had problems 
Now they can't possibly blame Tendulkar because he is doing a very
good job
Very good job 
But still they're losing there must be something
wrong with them like whole team
 It's high time all of them got together and did
something about it instead of losing each and every match and 
We just look forward to those eleven to do something for that
 Yeah 
Yeah 
So you are interested in cricket also
Yeah 
What else 
Uh I haven't played cricket really in the formal sense
In college we had a ground where sometimes we used to put on
gloveses for the heck of saying we were playing cricket 
In fact the right pose I mean the boy used to carry the bat also
was never taught but okay we picked up on our own
But I uh play Tennis and uh Badminton I love the game
 so it just goes on 
And what about uh books and music and how do you keep
yourself busy in leisure time
I read lots of books only English 
You know both the languages you have uh edge like
 uh you know Telugu and Bangla both
Yeah 
So which books you prefer reading 
Telugu and Bangla I am more comfortable in Bangla
Frankly speaking I haven't read any book in Telugu
I see 
So
So even the Telugu very famous poems are coming out
now on
I know never one word 
You have a very famous uh feminist poet like
Jayprabha and all so you haven't gone through 
No I haven't 
I have gone through but I didn't understand 
I see somehow I read some of the translated poems of
Jayprabha and I like them a lot
Yeah but its sequence are not understanding if you went
through it in Telugu
True
Because my vocabulary is only the limited and the
 coloquial sort of what you call how much of vocabulary can you get
at home 
I understand 
Outside it was entirely different 
No I didn't really pick up the language as such but I can
converse and like that 
 So when you write to your parents which
language you write in 
To my father English to my mother Telugu to my
grandparents Telugu aunt Telugu
So you know the written variety of Telugu also 
The written varieties I write down what I speak that
should not be one word 
But don't you find any difference between the okay
letter writing would be uh would have a different style like it
won't be exactly spoken variety of a language
That I have picked up to some extent with the replies I keep
getting from whoever I had written 
 Did you ever had paper on Telugu 
No actually two words have in M A 
Till your M A 
So with my one word 
Okay
I two words 
So don't you find it very uhm different like you
being a Telugu uh using another language and more comfortable in another
language which is not your mother tongue
So how do you feel
How do you take it
Uh actually uh some thing more like one word
 laughs 
Uh I haven't thought about this
Actually from childhood only I was brought up in the same
atmosphere like if Papa still has shifted to another place I would have
got the feeling of not having comfortable in a particular language but on
the whole I think it doesn't matter exactly how we go about chosing or
selecting a language 
So you are really an Indian 
Thank you laughs 
What about today evening 
Okay we might go somewhere no 
Because if sitting here and uh I think yeah 
doing nothing is very boring
 Yeah 
You are really getting boring yeah and uh as
far as when I haven't yet started my work 
 Yeah 
Even I haven't because I just joined and I have to know
like what exactly I am supposed to do
I have got an idea but uh
Yeah 
No but that is uh 
Even uh okay even after office hours like no what else
 that's true and so we can go somewhere else
 That's true 
Make the evening enjoyable 
So we can go somewhere to eat how do you perhaps
 like it
 Perhaps 
Uh 
I am thinking about but only certain things I
mean not all the time so
Okay I am one word to some extent
We are usually blamed because people say the girl is 
uh a few words 
 A few words 
Don't talk about like this laughs 
 It's just food and food and food 
Seventy-five percent of fair income is spent on food
But don't you ever notice once like we had a teacher in 
uh Hyderabad University who used to say like uh for breakfast you should
come to south and for uh lunch okay you can go anywhere but the
snacks you should go to Calcutta laughs 
Because I think she not only came there you can't get
any where else
No I remember novels and the chalks 
see you don't get it anywhere no else beside say West
Bengal in general
 No 
Yeah 
And famous rasgulla of course
 Haan 
You can't get it anywhere else 
I don't think laughs there is any 
person who would have not tasted it 
Are you crazy for sweet 
 I know one word 
Not exactly but uh Calcutta sweets I think they do have
a little flavour and that I haven't got anywhere in India
Yeah that's it 
But I tend to be very crazy for sweets than chocolates so 
 I'm actually I actually go for good food 
I don't like quantity but quality should be there
Yeah laughs 
So whatever it is whichever country whatever preparations I
don't mind but it should be tasting good
Yeah tasty
 That's what matter 
 But here 
 Do you have Chinese food 
Yeah I enjoy it 
Uh a few words so lousy
It was not Chinese because the Chinese they never put
sugar in Chao min 
Yes sugar in Chao min they put tomato
Yeah
I mean I could have made a better preparation
 That's not a Chinese preparation 
Half of the people don't know how to cook them no 
 Don't know how to cook
And you should go to a typical Chinese
restaurant
 But why so that you have lots of these Chinese
restaurants in Calcutta while its comparatively less less 
in Mysore or even in Hyderabad why is it so 
 Less 
 I do have a feeling that in south specially 
the people uh do go for their food preparation mostly
No one word 
I haven't seen people uh going for other dishes
No and I think another reason is the percentage of
people who spent money on outside eating is comparatively less
 on restaurant than in the north in general 
Even I suppose the Punjabis and uh the Gujratis also do
go in for all this stuff
 On restaurant 
 Less 
Yeah they do
