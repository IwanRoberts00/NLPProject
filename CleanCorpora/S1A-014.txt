""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in Calcutta
""
""
No but you spent most of your uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah but we were forced to stay in Siligudi because my parents
were working there
""
""
""
""
""
""
But how many years uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
School life I spent there 
""
""
But still you have  no liking for the place
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You can do something or the other and keep yourself busy
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

Something is wrong with the  Indian team
""
""
I think they don't have that uh  team spirit or something
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
had problem with all the captains like  when Kapil was the captain they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
good job
""
""
Very good job 
""
""
But still  there must be something
""
""
""
 all of them got together and did
""
""
""
We just look forward to those eleven to do something for that
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
So you are interested in cricket also
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  I haven't played cricket really in the formal sense
""
""
In college we had a ground where  sometimes we used to put on
gloveses for the heck of saying we were playing cricket 
""
In fact the right pose I mean the boy used to carry the bat also
""

You know both the languages  edge like

You have a very famous uh feminist  like

Outside it was entirely different 
""
No I didn't  but I can
converse and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
grandparents Telugu  aunt Telugu
""
""
""
""
""

But don't you find any difference between the  okay
letter writing would be uh  it
""
