Let me tell you

""
""
""
Anybody giving donation we are giving receipt  that's
""
""
""
""
""
No 
""
We are not taking any donation  for
admission of the children 
""
We are taking the donation 
students 
""
Whenever we take any donation 
""
""
""
""
Every donor is given a receipt 
""
""
See we continously collect  irrespective
of their status 
""
And then we issue the receipts 
""
Now  cordial
relations with the parents  uh our English medium
parents  uh the parents of the
Kannada  because they come from the economically higher
strata in the society 
""
And uh  also often give us suggestions and
ideas 
""
And we always accept their suggestions if they are  uh uh
academically sound  these
ideas and suggestions 
""
Now sometime of course the  uh the parents may say that we need
 and
such suggestions are also made 
""
But they are not within uh uh you see our  abilities for the
time being  and we had
recently 
 of the junior
uh K G K G section and primary  on the
twenty  uh
parents of English secondary school 
""
Uh we have tried in the past six years  though not this year
 uh teach Kannada school
""
But  limited and therefore we
didn't try
""
But next year  uh of the
Kannada parents 
""
Now  addressed by
Keshavrao 
""
This is within his right because
""
""
He is a member
""
""
He is a member and we had printed if you have any question on
report  he has sent
the  but he is not uh
present 
""
""
 uh uh mean
inform the members  and we may give the reply
that is understood 
""
""
Now he had pointed out  uh two mistakes in the report and
uh 
""
""
Printed mistake
""
""
Printers mistake 
""
The notice says nineteen ninety  ninety-four
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Budget
""
""
And uh 
 it should be read as
 not mentioned
some places 
""
And uh he wanted to know  uh
school committee meetings uh from uh  while
there are six school committee meetings in Kannada medium 
""
My reply to  uh initiative to call the meetings
entirely lies with the  Head Mistresses of the
respective school  uh
felt that uh  many meetings were not required
""
However  told the H M of English medium
school 
""
""
""
""
""
Then uh there were suggestions to hold the continous  uh
meetings of the school committee on the same day  so that there will be
equal uh number of uh meetings 
""
Uh my reply to that is that it is not possible because 
the  most of the members of the committee from the management side are
honorary  three four hours at a stretch in the
school 
""
So meetings have to be on different uh 
""
Then there was a question why there is a separate 
 for English primary
 primary
""
""
My reply to that  Kannada primary has a
very small strength 
under the rules 
Kannada primary and therefore Kannada primary is looked after by the 
Secondary  without
any extra remuneration 
""
He has also asked why  uh Junior College uh is also looked
after by 
""
Answer to that is very simple  the Junior College
is the extension of the Kannada High School  and under the rules we cannot
appoint a separate person to  the Head Mistresses
had to look after that also  uh given by the
government not by the management  uh an additional honorarium of hundred
""
""
Now  sub-
committees are met 
meant 
""
Health committee 
attended to all the health problems arising 
""
They  uh in
the last six years 
""
And  their
functions properly 
""
Uh  the
question 
""
The report is very clear that we have not mentioned any life
member because we  have uh stopped enrolling life members since nineteen
seventy-four 
""
And that is uh reason why  brought the amendments in
the 
""
Now he wanted to know  uh the forty-seven children studying in
Kannada  uh studying Kannada in English medium school whether they are
outsiders or  uh insiders
""
They are our own children  in English
medium  they want Kannada
to be  voluntary provision for teaching
of  uh Kannada in the English medium school
""
There is no compulsion 
""
Similarly  uh introduced uh on a voluntary
basis computer education 
and uh  and
 and
therefore the  is not directly involved in the
 except providing room for computers to be
placed
