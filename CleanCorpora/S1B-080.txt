If there are any questions clarifications you need please

And we'll give you explanations on every issue
But normally in some institutions what they do they go page by
page 
Page number one page number two any suggestions ?

seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
 fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen

twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty thirty-one 
thirty-two page thirty-three thirty-four thirty-five 
thirty-six thirty-seven anybody wants any clarification please
come 
Yeah interruption 
Let me tell you 
 One word donation of one word 
Anybody giving donation we are giving receipt that's
 the one thing 
 A few words 
No let me make it very clear 
We are not taking any donation from the parents for
admission of the children to the school 
We are taking the donation from anybody parents 
students well wishers uh connected unconnected anybody 
Whenever we take any donation we issue the receipt 
 One or two words 
Every donor is given a receipt 
See we continously collect uh donations irrespective
of their status 
And then we issue the receipts 
Now uh we have uh always tried to maintain cordial
relations with the parents and uh often uh our English medium
parents they are more alert and active than uh the parents of the
Kannada school because they come from the economically higher
strata in the society 
And uh they are also often give us suggestions and
ideas to improve the working of the school 
And we always accept their suggestions if they are uh uh
academically sound and financially feasible to implement uh these
ideas and suggestions 
Now sometime of course the uh the parents may say that we need
 uh more time for childrens to play and uh Badminton court and
such suggestions are also made 
But they are not within uh uh you see our abilities for the
time being but the point is that we too uh meet and we had
recently about uh three we weeks 
 back in the month of November we had a meeting uh of the junior
uh K G K G section and primary and subsequently after a week on the
twenty uh seventh of November we had a meeting with the uh
parents of English secondary school 
Uh we have tried in the past six years though not this year
 to have a meeting of the parents of Kannada uh teach Kannada school
But uh response has been very limited and therefore we
didn't try
But next year we will also have the meeting uh of the
Kannada parents 
Now Mr Chairman I had received a letter addressed by
Keshavrao of fourteen points 
This is within his right because
He is a member
He is a member and we had printed if you have any question on
report you should raise it in writing three days before he has sent
the letter and I had prepared the answers but he is not uh
present 
 I'll ask the Secretary to hurriedly uh uh mean
inform the members what were the questions and we may give the reply
that is understood 
Now he had pointed out uh two mistakes in the report and
uh these mistakes are uh accepted that uh 
Printed mistake
Printers mistake 
The notice says nineteen ninety two ninety-four
 it should be read as uh ninety-three ninety-four 
 Two 
 Ninety-three 
Budget
And uh wherever we are told appears in the 
 I'm sorry wherever English school appears it should be read as
 B R one word English High School we've not mentioned
some places B R one word he wanted us to be specific 
And uh he wanted to know why there are only three uh
school committee meetings uh from uh in the English medium while
there are six school committee meetings in Kannada medium 
My reply to that is uh initiative to call the meetings
entirely lies with the Headmistress Head Mistresses of the
respective school and uh possibly the H M of English school has uh uh
felt that uh many meetings were not required
However we've already told the H M of English medium
school to call the meetings more often 
 Headmistress 
Then uh there were suggestions to hold the continous uh
meetings of the school committee on the same day so that there will be
equal uh number of uh meetings 
Uh my reply to that is that it is not possible because 
the most of the members of the committee from the management side are
honorary and they can't spend uh three four hours at a stretch in the
school 
So meetings have to be on different uh days 
Then there was a question why there is a separate uh uh 
 Head Ma Head Mistress for English primary
 and why there is no separate Head Mistress for uh Kannada primary
My reply to that uh uh as you know Kannada primary has a
very small strength and English primary has more than four hundred 
under the rules we cannot have uh separate Head Mistress for uh 
Kannada primary and therefore Kannada primary is looked after by the 
Secondary Head mas Head Mistress without
any extra remuneration 
He has also asked why uh Junior College uh is also looked
after by the Head Mistress of Kannada High School 
Answer to that is very simple that uh the Junior College
is the extension of the Kannada High School and under the rules we cannot
appoint a separate person to the Junior College the Head Mistresses
had to look after that also and under the rule she is uh given by the
government not by the management uh an additional honorarium of hundred
 rupees which she has been getting 
Now he wanted to know how often the various sub-
committees are met uh my answer to that is maintenance committee has 
meant uh met number of times to maintain the building 
Health committee ha has 
attended to all the health problems arising in the schools 
They uh fund raising committee has raised the funds uh in
the last six years at different times 
And therefore the sub-committees are doing uh their
functions properly 
Uh how many life members were enrolled that is uh the
question 
The report is very clear that we have not mentioned any life
member because we have uh stopped enrolling life members since nineteen
seventy-four 
And that is uh reason why we've brought the amendments in
the extra ordinary general uh meeting 
Now he wanted to know uh the forty-seven children studying in
Kannada uh studying Kannada in English medium school whether they are
outsiders or uh insiders
They are our own children studying in Kannada in English
medium but because their parents are from Karnatak they want Kannada
to be taught and we've made voluntary provision for teaching
of uh Kannada in the English medium school
There is no compulsion 
Similarly we've also uh introduced uh on a voluntary
basis computer education for which uh separate fees are charged 
and uh this is provided by on a voluntary basis uh they pay and
 one word Automation company is providing the education and
therefore the Mandal is not directly involved in the
 uh uh computer education except providing room for computers to be
placed
