As in the session  against
the accused number one 
""
The Prosecution has  miserably failed to establish the charge
""
""
P W one  evidence says
 hit
the 
""
This statement  has been
contradicted repeatedly  and
P W one himself 
""
According to the  and that
hit 
""
According to P W three 
""
This is the contradiction 
""
Now  the accused number
one was at 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And above all Your Honour  P W one himself does not say
""
""
Your Honour will see page number five 
""
""
""
Yes Your Honour 
""
Before cross examination  coming to the cross
examination 
""
Before cross examination  P W one has
said 
""
He had stated  in examination you see
""
""
""
Sir here are the contradiction which I want to point out 
""
In this examination you see  P W one
says  N H S
 on the rear side of his left shoulder
""
""
Thereafter all of these five assailants surrounded me and 
assault 
""
He does not say  throwing and hitting with a
stone 
""
He does not say anything 
""
He says  started
assaulting me 
""
""
""
No no what he says against 
""
""
""
No I have to 
that he does not say  N H S
""
""
""
""
No no contradiction not in that sense 
""
Contradiction so far as his  his own statement is
concerned 
""
Contradiction not between the statement and the evidence 
""
""
""
There were inconsistency  between
the evidence of P W three 
""
I realized in the cross examination 
""
Now here he says  I threw
it  of shoulder
""
""
He does not say 
""
He says  then all of them surrounded me and started
assaulting me 
""
Now Your Honour 
further goes on saying 
""
They started assaulting me 
""
How  ?
""
 on my
left forearm  on my
right wait wait 
""
""
""
He does not say 
""
""
""
No no no 
""
""
""
Your Honour  not
on that angle 
""
""
""
He says 
""
No Sir what he says that he was assaulted by 
""
""
He does not say he was assaulted by 
""
He says he was assaulted by Mr 
weap  by sickle
again  by
""
""
So he does not implicate 
that he assaulted him 
""
Page number six Your Honour top  at page number
forty-six says  accused number one told the other assailants
""
""
Page number forty-six Your Honour 
""
Yes 
""
So 
""
No Your Honour  coming to that
Your Honour 
""
Here I wanted to draw your attention  this piece
piece of evidence  so far as
any weapon is concerned 
""
This 
""
The three nought one coming to that 
""
So far as this 
""
Three nought seven also 
""
Sir 
""
Thirty-four 
interruption 
""
Sir therefore Your Honour  the common intention is to be proved
""
""
First of all 
interruption 
""
Not I want to prove the insistent inconsistency with the  piece
of evidences 
""
Now here  uh at page Your Honour at page
number four 
""
Page number five Your Honour Sir P W one says 
was armed with 
""
Sir we had 
""
Where Your Honour 
""
Where Your Honour  this is there is a lot of inconsistency with
""
""
Your Honour once approved  that the case which is defective
because of the infirmity of the evidence 
""
No then there is no point question of common intention Your Honour
""
""
Here Your Honour he says that all the accused assaulted me there he
says that I was having the  button knife
 that M G R was
having sickle 
""
P W three says 
""
Nobody says button knife 
""
No 
connect 
""
So that uh  can be made
before the court 
""
So Your Honour my submission is  my submission is Your Honour
 has not stated any
previous evidence  uh
""
He was assaulted by accused number one with any weapon 
interruption 
""
No Your Honour Your Honour has corrected my word  can't I
instead of contradiction 
""
Yes Your Honour 
""
Aa at page number thirty-four Your Honour what P W  three says
about the stone 
""
Your Honour if  nothing
remains 
""
If the  then accused sat down
""
""
I am a 
""
I am on the point  P
W one sustained injury he sat down 
""
And if he sustained injury 
actually  is the
means 
 would have suspect is accused number one would have been
""
""
And his commission was that  accused number
one according to the  that he
sat down  Your Honour he cannot be expected to act
actually 
""
He could not bear even a stone 
""
That was his health 
""
So Your Honour 
interruption 
""
Thereafter what happened  ?
""
Thereafter they went away 
""
Your Honour according to P W three  accused
number one  rest of the accused
""
""
That means accused number one did not assault at all 
""
Para twenty Your Honour page number forty 
""
Your Honour not only that he was simply hurt 
""
In a  page number forty para
twenty one 
""
Page forty 
""
Here  interruption
""
""
Yes 
""
He is talking about deceased 
""
I am talking about 
""
I am coming  finishing the
charge so far as 
""
Yes uh I I was 
""
Yes  I
""
""
She says that she doesn't know 
which weapon 
""
No mainly on the benefit of doubt it is not over  yes which
which arm  ?
""
""
The same witness  number P W three
herself says  I cannot
say 
""
When she cannot even see the weapon with which her own husband was
assaulted in 
""
She cannot see all  she cannot
exactly say 
""
She cannot exactly say who has assaulted 
""
Just merely taking 
""
""
Sir  before the
court when you had pointed out the knife 
""
He says  no blood mark on the
knife 
""
It was 
""
It was sealed 
""
If if 
interruption 
""
No no it is  it is very risky to leave this type of evidence
Your Honour when she says at page number forty-five  I cannot say who
was having what type of weapon 
""
Then uh  it will be very hardship if the portion of the
evidence 
and the evidence 
interruption 
""
Yes there are contradictions Your Honour 
""
Here I will point out the Supreme Court judgement  whenever
there are two versions  one goes in
 against the accused
""
The version which goes in favour of the accused  or any version
chosen by the accused 
""
No no here 
""
They have what 
""
Yes Your Honour at page forty-five she says  I cannot say
""
""
Why should I put that he he was having this weapon 
interruption 
""
Sir how can I suggest that I was having weapon  I was not
having  interruption
""
""
Yes Your Honour 
""
At last line paragraph thirty-six she says  I cannot say
as to 
""
Cross examination 
""
Forty-six  I cannot say as to who was
armed with which weapon 
""
So  P W three and P W one
""
either sickle  a a knife
""
Therefore  the assumption is that I was not having any weapon
either sickle or knife 
""
At page number thirty-four Your Honour  the P W three says
 told to kill my husband
""
""
Here 
""
So Your Honour may say that there are  having common intention
""
""
He does not 
""
""
positively 
""
After hitting with the stone  regarding
common intention 
""
Now Your Honour 
""
What I 
""
What I am trying to convince the court  a
different 
""
No there are different versions 
""
Your Honour 
""
Your Honour  uh I have come to
know that Your Honour was 
Your  Your Honour knows law better
than I understand 
""
In fact uh 
""
Thereafter I will stop my argument 
""
Mr Sheikh will 
""
One submission Your Honour 
""
 who was a very well
 challa
""
""
His statement was recorded by the police  interruption
""
""
What recorded by the police 
""
He was not called  interruption
""
""
Therefore Your Honour  pleasing
""
""
Even if  would have been called in the
state 
""
If 
interruption 
""
If the  interruption
""
""
If he would have been called  definitely Your Honour for
certain reasons we have not called the 
""
Your Honour I am citing in judgement therefore I am making my
submission 
""
If the  he would have
""
""
Uh Sir may I read the 
of Judgement Your Honour 
nineteen seventy-four Supreme Court  nineteen

""
Page seven seven eight 
""
It is equivalent to 
interruption 
""

Bhagwati

The ratio of judgement is that  Omission to

Section  of Indian
Evidence Act

There is  omission to produce the
important witness

Presumption

well present 
""
She was standing in the  but he was
present at the 
""
Her statement  her statement was recorded or not before the
Executive Magistrate 
""
Her statement was recorded before 
""
""
And at the time of trial she was not called
""
She was not brought as a witness 
""
Your Honour while giving judgement I am requesting 
interruption

No no 
whatever submissions uh uh which I might not have done which should I I have
done
