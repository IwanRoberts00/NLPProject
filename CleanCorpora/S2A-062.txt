As in the session Ex Ex Ex is concerned against
the accused number one 
The Prosecution has miserably failed to establish the charge
P W one Kadu Achari in his uh evidence says
 that I picked up a stone which was which which hit
the rear side of the accused shoulder and the accused sat down 
This statement this very version of the evidence has been
contradicted repeatedly not twice but repeatedly by P W three and
P W one himself 
According to the P W one he picked up one stone and that
hit that one word 
According to P W three the P W one has picked up two stones 
This is the contradiction 
Now the P W one P W three says the accused number
one was at distance of at about twenty feet 
Yes 
And above all Your Honour P W one himself does not say
 that he was assaulted by N H S 
Your Honour will see page number five paga page number five 
 interruption 
Yes Your Honour I'm coming to the cross examination 
Before cross examination I'm coming to the cross
examination 
Before cross examination let us see what the P W one has
said 
He had stated in examination you see
 interruption 
Sir here are the contradiction which I want to point out 
In this examination you see at page number six P W one
says I picked up a stone and threw it at that N H S
 which hit him on the rear on the rear side of his left shoulder
Thereafter all of these five assailants surrounded me and 
assault started assaulting me 
He does not say the effect of throwing and hitting with a
stone 
He does not say anything that the accused sat down 
He says all the accused surrounded me and started
assaulting me 
 interruption 
No no what he says against 
 interruption 
No I have to I am pointing out from the P W one himself 
that he does not say as the latter said he does not say that N H S
 has assaulted me 
 interruption 
No no contradiction not in that sense I'm talking 
Contradiction so far as his sta his own statement is
concerned uh his own evidence is concerned 
Contradiction not between the statement and the evidence 
 interruption 
There were inconsistency between the e between
the evidence of P W three and the examination in D 
I realized in the cross examination 
Now here he says I picked up a stone I threw
it it hit the rear side of sh of shoulder
 of the N H S 
He does not say that he sat down 
He says then all of them surrounded me and started
assaulting me 
Now Your Honour Your Honour thereafter P W one 
further goes on saying they surrounded me 
They started assaulting me 
How how ?
 Mota Umesh assaulted me with sickle on my
left forearm Big Umesh assaulted me with by sickle on my
right wait wait 
 Big Umesh assaulted me on the right thigh 
He does not say N 
 interruption 
No no no 
 interruption 
Your Honour I'm not on that angle I'm not
on that angle 
 interruption 
He says interruption 
No Sir what he says that he was assaulted by C D E and F 
He does not say he was assaulted by N H S 
He says he was assaulted by Mr C with this 
weap this weapon sickle D by sickle
again D by this weapon and E by last E by
 nothing no weapon is there 
So he does not implicate N H S accused number one 
that he assaulted him 
Page number six Your Honour top P W three at page number
forty-six says that accused number one told the other assailants
 to assault him 
Page number forty-six Your Honour 
Yes yes 
So Yo interruption 
No Your Honour interruption I'm coming to that
Your Honour 
Here I wanted to draw your attention on this this piece
piece of evidence that he has not implicated the N H S so far as
any weapon is concerned with which he was assaulted interruption 
This Achari's statement interruption 
The three nought one coming to that 
So far as this interruption 
Three nought seven also interruption 
Sir interruption 
Thirty-four interruption Common intention 
interruption 
Sir therefore Your Honour the common intention is to be proved
 uh I'm coming to that also 
First of all charge under section three hundred 
interruption 
Not I want to prove the insistent inconsistency with the piece
of evidences 
Now here interruption uh at page Your Honour at page
number four he says that accused number 
Page number five Your Honour Sir P W one says N H S 
was armed with button knife 
Sir we had interruption 
Where Your Honour interruption 
Where Your Honour this is there is a lot of inconsistency with
 in the evidence of the same person 
Your Honour once approved that the case which is defective
because of the infirmity of the evidence 
No then there is no point question of common intention Your Honour
 interruption 
Here Your Honour he says that all the accused assaulted me there he
says that I was having the butto he was having the button knife
 and what he has stated before P W seven came that M G R was
having sickle 
P W three says N H S was having sickle 
Nobody says button knife interruption 
No I'm connect see I'm read it jointly 
connect jointly connect 
So that uh any uh any formal statement can be made
before the court interruption 
So Your Honour my submission is my submission is Your Honour
 that the particular witness P W one has not stated any
previous evidence that he was assaulted by P W uh
He was assaulted by accused number one with any weapon 
interruption 
No Your Honour Your Honour has corrected my word can't I
instead of contradiction inconsistent 
Yes Your Honour 
Aa at page number thirty-four Your Honour what P W three says
about the stone 
Your Honour if if that is so Your Honour then nothing
remains 
If the stone is hit to the accused then accused sat down
 interruption 
I am a interruption 
I am on the point there once that interruption P
W one sustained injury he sat down if he sat down 
And if he sustained injury he cannot be expected to act 
actually to assault the accused num of P W one is the
means it's this acc aa accused 
 number one would have suspect is accused number one would have been
 hit with that stone 
And his commission was that he sat down accused number
one according to the evidence of P W three P W one that he
sat down and thereafter Your Honour he cannot be expected to act
actually to assault someone to that extent 
He could not bear even a stone 
That was his health 
So Your Honour Your Honour presuming the two days later as 
interruption and sat down thereafter 
Thereafter what happened ?
Thereafter they went away interruption 
Your Honour according to P W three thereafter accused
number one respected accused was rest of the accused
 according to P W three were assault 
That means accused number one did not assault at all 
Para twenty Your Honour page number forty 
Your Honour not only that he was simply hurt he shouted 
In a expec interruption page number forty para
twenty one 
Page forty interruption 
Here N H S was armed with sickle interruption
 
Yes he is talking about deceased 
He is talking about deceased Iyengar 
I am talking about Kadu Achari interruption 
I am coming to that a afterwards finishing the
charge so far as Kadu Achari is concerned interruption 
Yes uh I I was interruption 
Yes he says here and thereafter she says I
 I do not know what weapons who was having 
She says that she doesn't know which accused was having 
which weapon interruption 
No mainly on the benefit of doubt it is not over yes which
which arm interruption no no assault assault with what ?
 interruption 
The same witness interruption number P W three
herself says at page number forty-five P W three says I cannot
say as to who was armed with which weapon 
When she cannot even see the weapon with which her own husband was
assaulted in in her before her own eyes 
She cannot see all she cannot interruption she cannot
exactly say who has assaulted interruption 
She cannot exactly say who has assaulted 
Just merely taking somebody's name interruption 
Sir blood mark on the knife though before before the
court when you had pointed out the knife 
He says there's there's no blood mark on the
knife interruption 
It was it was sealed in the wrapper interruption 
It was sealed labelled interruption 
If if if at all the blood was there it should be there 
interruption 
No no it is it is very risky to leave this type of evidence
Your Honour when she says at page number forty-five I cannot say who
was having what type of weapon interruption 
Then uh it will be very hardship if the portion of the
evidence which goes in favour of the Prosecution is to be selected 
and the evidence the fortune of which something might even 
interruption 
Yes there are contradictions Your Honour 
Here I will point out the Supreme Court judgement whenever
there are two versions one goes in favour of the accused one goes in
 fav against the accused
The version which goes in favour of the accused or any version
chosen by the accused interruption 
No no here interruption 
They have what interruption 
Yes Your Honour at page forty-five she says I cannot say
 what type of weapon who was having interruption 
Why should I put that he he was having this weapon 
interruption 
Sir how can I suggest that I was having weapon I was not
having knife I was having sickle can I suggest him interruption
Yes Your Honour interruption 
At last line paragraph thirty-six she says I cannot say
as to interruption 
Cross examination interruption 
Forty-six last line I cannot say as to who was
armed with which weapon 
So that both the witnesses P W three and P W one
 I have not established any particular weapon which I was having 
either sickle or a a knife
Therefore the assumption is that I was not having any weapon
either sickle or knife 
At page number thirty-four Your Honour the P W three says
 N H S and Asami told to kill my husband
 
Here here also Your Honour told 
So Your Honour may say that there are having common intention
 Your Honour here also the N H S is inactive 
He does not inactive 
 He doe he does not act 
positively by assaulting 
After hitting with the stone interruption regarding
common intention 
Now Your Honour interruption no interruption 
What I interruption 
What I am trying to convince the court there's a
different interruption 
No there are different versions 
Your Honour give me one minutes time 
Your Honour so far as so far as uh I have come to
know that Your Honour was lecturer also yo 
Your Honour was a lecturer also Your Honour knows law better
than I understand 
In fact uh Sir I am making my own submission 
Thereafter I will stop my argument 
Mr Sheikh will argue and he will cover my client also 
One submission Your Honour regarding Ramna 
 Ramna Raman Raman Ramna who was a very well
 who present who was present at the time of this challa
 game 
His statement was recorded by the police interruption
What recorded by the police interruption 
He was not called as a witness in the box interruption
 
Therefore Your Honour adverse inference made pleasing
 taken 
Even if if the Ramna would have been called in the
state 
If Ramna would have been called as a witness 
interruption 
If the Ramna would have been called interruption
If he would have been called definitely Your Honour for
certain reasons we have not called the Ramna 
Your Honour I am citing in judgement therefore I am making my
submission 
If the Ramna would have been called he would have
 damaged the case of the Prosecution 
Uh Sir may I read the ra ratio
