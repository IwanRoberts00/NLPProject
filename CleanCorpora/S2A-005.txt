Vijayan again the captain 
jersey number eight

to Manoj Bhatt 
snatched away by Vijayan

Manoj Bhatt doesn't keep the ball in play 
now throw-in for Kerala 
Joseph 
Santosh 
 he's got two defenders there 
that is Jarcinto clearing the ball

for perhaps the best turnout in this tournament so
far 
throw-in for Kerala 
Joseph the left wing-back to take the throw-in 
the referee asking that uh to be taken again

a short pass there comes to Vijayan 
a free-kick again 
this time in favour of Maharashtra 
Shanti Kumar now 
looses out 
to Suresh Kumar 
but a tightly packed Maharashtra defence 
is quite strong in that department 
Everesto Cardoz the captain playing in the defence today
this is how Kerala progressed to the final 
in the quarter-final league they drew Madhya-Pradesh zero-zero
 then beat Uttar-Pradesh four-zero 
then beat the Bengal three-one Andhra_Pradesh three-zero 
and in the semi-final they got past Goa by four goals to three

teams yet to settle down here 
trying to find openings 
 here's Jarcinto de Silva to Akeel Ansari 
Arif Ansari now 
to Shanti Kumar who doesn't trap it neatly 
Santosh now for Kerala 
that is back-heel there 
taken by the Maharashtra player 
Manoj Bhatt 
to Godfrey Pereira 
Pereira cutting in on the right flank 
being tackled and brought down 
A good spot smarting up a women's spectator
 here in the stadium this afternoon 
and uh a free-kick for Maharashtra 
Manoj Bhatt the linkman to take the kick 
four players Maharashtra players inside the box 
the ball deflecting off Vijayan and going out 
for a 
 it's going to be another free-kick 
or rather a kick being awarded to Kerala 
these teams have met nine times earlier in this 
championship and it's been Kerala who have won five times
the other matches ending in draws 
some excitement at the Kerala half 
 that's a shot at the Kerala bench 
their coach K K Gopalakrishnan was a member of the Kerala team
 played in 1966 
Kerala with the ball now 
Rasheed 
long ball to Hashim 
Santosh now in possession 
Maharashtra defence regrouping very well a good ball here for
Harshan 
inside the penalty area 
but there're two defenders there to take care of
Harshan Everesto Cardoz and Jarcinto de Silva 
and uh this is the progress chart of Maharashtra to the final
in the quarter-final league they drew Karnataka one-all beat
Punjab one-zero then beat Assam four-one and in the final
quarter-final league beat Goa one-zero 
in the semi-final they got past a fancied Bengal by one goal to
nil a goal scored by Shanti Kumar 
Rasheed now for Kerala 
chip into the penalty area there headed out by Everesto Cardoz 
and after about uh fifteen minutes of play come in Baldev
Sachdeva 
so the play about to resume now after a slight hold-up 
goalkeeper Mohammad Kadir and Everesto Cardoz going for that ball
 and in the clash Cardoz had fallen down and now the 
game resumes again 
Kerala now building up an attack through the right flank 
Harshan going for that ball 
but doesn't control it well it goes off a defender 
Ashok Nair and it's going to be a corner-kick for Kerala
about two thirty-two minutes of play gone in the first half 
neither team have scored yet 
Kerala is better as far as attacks are concerned 
that uh kick hitting Ashok Nair and it's 
going to be a free-kick for Kerala 
a good chance here for Kerala to open the score 
that was a good intelligent kick taken there by Jiju Jacob
but equally well deflected by Manoj Bhatt for a corner 
yet another one for Kerala 
the goalkeeper Kadir doesn't gathered that one 
but Maharashtra keep possession Akeel Ansari 
Santosh now for Kerala 
trying to put through Vijayan there 
ball running loose 
to Sabu 
he tries a left-footer from around thirty yards a rather weak
shot 
nothing much here for the crowd to enthuse 
Only mild flutter was provided by Hashim in the eighteenth
minute 
a good ball put through by Jiju which found him 
with only the goalkeeper to beat and he shot wide 
now here's a chance for Maharashtra Godfrey Pereira 
centring that one 
but way over the goalline 
Kerala entering the final of the Santosh trophy for the forth
consecutive time 
three times runners-up from nineteen eighty-eight onwards 
and the crowd here are hoping that it would be forth time lucky
for Kerala 
Kerala in possession now 
ball there for Vijayan 
Harshan in control here 
good chance and he puts it over the goal 
both the Maharashtra defenders Everesto Cardoz and Jarcinto 
didn't mark him there and Harshan there you see him jersey number eleven
 had a good chance 
a snap move by Kerala there Harshan all by himself 
with the defenders trying to regroup 
he tackled the ball well but then his left-footer sailing
over the bar 
so yet another chance going abegging as far as Kerala
is concerned 
they have done most of this attacking in this match so
far 
now Everesto Cardoz the Maharashtra captain who played for
India in the Nehru Gold Cup giving it to Shanti Kumar 
ball taken away by Vijayan 
Jarcinto de Silva now for Maharashtra 
to Manoj Bhatt 
to Arif Ansari
good ball down the right flank 
and the Kerala defence quite tight there 
marking the Maharashtra player and uh 
they earn a free-kick 
Hamid the stopper-back 
looking for an unmarked player 
headed out by Jarcinto 
Harshan being put through on the right flank 
ball again deflecting off the Maharashtra wall 
Suresh Kumar now for Kerala 
Hashim tightly marked 
Cardoz with a clearance 
Arif Ansari 
trying to put through Godfrey Pereira there 
 there's Jiju Jacob 
tall Kerala defender who also played the last 
year's final of the Santosh trophy against Goa 
the lone victory for Kerala in the Santosh trophy came in
nineteen seventy-three one word home turf in Ernakulam 
when they beat Railways three-two in the final 
Maharashtra on the other hand twice winners of the Santosh
trophy in nineteen fifty-four and nineteen sixty-three 
throw-in for Kerala 
Hashim there being tightly marked 
 that's another throw-in 
Jiju Jacob 
now Shanti Kumar 
ball coming to Sabu 
Vijayan there trying to put through Hashim 
but his chip there a little too long for Hashim 
and Kadir in possession for Maharashtra 
Everesto Cardoz 
trying to inspire his forward line 
done very little today 
again a rather aimless pass 
 we've seen very few attacks by the Maharashtra
forwards today 
they haven't combined well 
and there have been very little understanding between the half
line and the forward line 
Vijayan now 
with fallen back 
trying to put through Harshan there's the tall
Everesto with a header 
ball coming to Jiju Jacob 
the pace of the game considerably slackened here 
 it's a quite hot afternoon 
temperature in the mid-thirties 
and it certainly would be energy sapping here for the 
players 
the first half slowly coming to an end 
neither team have scored yet 
Kerala now trying to build up a move through the right flank 
Suresh Kumar there up 
ball cleared 
again a mispass comes to Shanti Kumar 
 who'll be switching over from Mahindras to Mohun
Bagan next season 
Akeel Ansari now being dispossessed 
Santosh 
to Rasheed 
trying to find Hashim on the right flank 
very few passes here finding the intended player 
Shanti Kumar for Maharashtra 
to Everesto Cardoz 
Vijayan tackling him there from behind 
free-kick for Maharashtra 
Godfrey Pereira 
trying to wield his way through 
to Shanti Kumar 
Manoj Bhatt 
cleared out by the Kerala defence 
crowd here certainly gone quiet 
and that's a throw-in none of the Maharashtra forwards
there 
 it's going to be a goal-kick for Kerala 
the first half coming to a close 
neither team have scored yet 
with less than five minutes of play left 
Rasheed 
ball for Harshan 
and that improper charge there 
the free-kick for Maharashtra 
Jarcinto de de Silva the stopper-back 
Vijay Thapa has takes a tumble there 
comes to Joseph 
the Kerala left wing back 
Hamid now 
Harshan 
to Jiju Jacob 
the overlapping defender for Kerala 
and his pass there misdirected 
another Kerala move comes to nought 
a quick counterattack here from Maharashtra 
Arif Ansari 
but keeps hold of the ball a little too long there 
Akeel Ansari now 
Cardoz again an aimless pass 
Kerala gained possession 
Suresh Kumar 
ball again running loose here 
comes to the goalkeeper 
Rasheed for Kerala 
a long ball trying to find Hashim 
 there's Jarcinto with that header 
Harshan now with the ball 
good chance for Vijayan 
takes a shot from just outside the penalty box a
left-footer which goes out 
Vijayan the captain of the Kerala team also member of the
Kerala Police team which won the Federation Cup this year 
and a wayward kick taken there by goalkeeper Kadir sends it
 over the sideline 
Kerala keep possession 
Hamid 
long ball there for Santosh 
 there's Jarcinto handling that situation very well
comes to Godfrey Pereira 
and Maharashtra earn a free-kick 
crowd has come here with banners and drums 
quite a boisterous crowd 
referee Samil awarding that free-kick to Maharashtra 
just inside the Kerala half 
Vijay Thapa the vice-captain to take the kick 
Jiju the taller player there getting the better of that duel
Kerala in possession
Jiju Jacob overlapping 
cutting in there very well 
and a good ball there for Hashim
a good chance for Kerala 
and Hashim putting it over the net he had only to beat the
goalkeeper there 
very intelligent play there by Jiju Jacob 
cut in very well
