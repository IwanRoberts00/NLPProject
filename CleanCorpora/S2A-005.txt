the other matches ending in

some excitement

their coach K K Gopalakrishnan was a member of the  Kerala team
""
""
Kerala with the ball now 
""
Rasheed 
""
long ball to 
""
Santosh now in possession 
""
Maharashtra defence  regrouping very well a good ball here for
Harshan 
""
inside the penalty area 
""
but  to take care of
Harshan 
""
and uh this is the  progress chart of Maharashtra to the final
""
""
in the quarter-final league they drew Karnataka one-all  beat
Punjab one-zero then beat Assam four-one  in the final
quarter-final league

in the semi-final they got  past a fancied Bengal by one goal to
nil 
""
Rasheed now for Kerala 
""
chip into the penalty area there headed out by Everesto Cardoz

""
Kerala now building up an attack through the right flank 
""
Harshan going for that ball 
""
but 
Ashok Nair  for Kerala
""
""
about two thirty-two minutes of play gone in the first half 
neither team have scored yet 
""
Kerala 
""
that uh 
going to be a 
""
a good chance here for Kerala 
""
that was a good  kick taken there by Jiju Jacob
""
""
but 
""
yet another one for Kerala 
""
the goalkeeper Kadir doesn't 
""
but Maharashtra 
""
Santosh now for Kerala 
""
trying to put through Vijayan there 
""
ball running loose 
""
to Sabu 
""
he tries a left-footer  from around thirty yards a rather weak
shot 
""
nothing much here for the crowd to enthuse 
""
Only mild  Hashim in the eighteenth
minute 
""
a good ball 
with only the goalkeeper to beat 
""
now 
""
centring that one 
""
but way over the 
""
Kerala entering the final of the Santosh trophy for the forth
consecutive time 
""
three times runners-up from nineteen eighty-eight onwards 
""
and the crowd here are hoping that it would be  forth time lucky
for Kerala 
""
Kerala in possession now 
""
ball there for Vijayan 
""
Harshan in control here 
""
good chance and he puts it over the goal 
""
both the Maharashtra defenders Everesto Cardoz and Jarcinto 
didn't mark him there and Harshan  there you see him jersey number eleven
""
""
a snap move by Kerala there Harshan all by himself 
""
with the defenders trying to regroup 
""
he tackled the ball well  sailing
over the bar 
""
so yet another chance going  Kerala
is concerned 
""
they have done  match so
far 
""
now Everesto Cardoz  the Maharashtra captain who played for
India in the Nehru Gold Cup 
""
ball taken away by Vijayan

Jiju Jacob

Everesto Cardoz 
""
trying to inspire his forward line 
""
done very little today 
""
again a rather aimless

 Maharashtra
forwards

they haven't combined well

and there have been very little  understanding between the half
line and the forward line 
""
Vijayan now 
""
with fallen back 
""
trying to put through Harshan  the tall
Everesto with a header 
""
ball coming to

the pace of the game considerably

and  none of the Maharashtra forwards
there 
""
""
""
the first half 
""
neither team have scored yet 
""
with less than five minutes of play left 
""
Rasheed

ball for Harshan
