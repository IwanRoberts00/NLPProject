You know  right
""
Today was  uh suppose to have been the first day of brave new
India 
""
A day on which we were to  our
economic policies
""
And therefore transit on  to a high growth path after a short
period of painful adjustment on
""
And that was  what it was supposed to be
""
How it turned out to be  is really going to be our discussion
""
""
We are likely to have with us on the panel today people who have
been in one way or the other involved in this  fashions
a brave new India
""
""
""
Uh Mr Pranab Mukharjee  deputy chairman of the planning
commission  Mr Deepak Nair chief economic adviser of ministery of finance
Government of India 
""
""
Also with us on the panel  uh on our side of the panel is
in-house  I'll
 take off by asking Dileep the first question
""
Dileep do you think uh  the way the day has unfolded it was uh
 ?
""
""
""
brave enough 
""
Sure  quite a few things that
this country desperately needs 
""
 with lots
of political cheese cake 
""
But the budget has to be really seen  the
other major documents that was presented today  which is the industrial
policy 
""
As it  three or four
basic needs of the hour 
""
One the need for austerity 
""
Second  and
ought to invest in India 
""
And three to fashion  a completely new kind of
economy 
""
But to my mind  does do some other things that is
including these areas 
""
It certainly delivers  as far as the capital market is
concerned 
""
I think it does  to the money
market 
""
 has
been held at the level at which be held 
""
And  to my
mind 
""
But 
""
I think it disappoints in certain other areas 
""
Uhm I am not entirely happy with what happened  as far as the
public sector is concerned 
""
Neither an industrial policy  nor as far as the budget is
concerned are enough signals being given  as to what is going to happen in
that area 
""
Not enough is seen as far as  curbing of conspicous consumption
 is going to be
done 
""
And I am worried about the signals that are sending out  for
corporate investment 
""
And I think for some reason or the other  perhaps for good
reason of his own  on
three other areas 
""
One is  except for what he has
done as far as 
""
This doesn't seem to be enough incentive for N R 
to invest back in India again 
""
I am concerned about the 
much much harder 
""
And I don't see enough effort  in this whole belt tightening
exercise that  in tightening of
government expenditure 
""
So these to my 
""
There are two more areas  cause concern
today 
""
I am worried about the kind of  unchecked growth of interest
payment 
""
""
""
And  Dr Singh says that it is going to go up to fifty percent
 by nineteen ninety-four nineteen
ninety-five 
""
And  to get rid of
that 
be uh costing the economy  four thousand
five hundred  in the three year period that we are
looking at 
""
These to my mind are areas of concerned today 
""
""
 view is repeated in
Hindi 
""
""
I see that uh  congress
manifesto
""
Open to page twenty-two  which says
 sure you agree with
Dileep when he says that it delivers on A B M C 
""
But  when
 disappoints
""
""
""
Uh  budget
is one instrument 
""
""
And particularly this  reviewed
 which has been
announced 
""
Trade policy 
announced a little  readjustment programme
which have been initiated by the 
""
Congress as a party  to the electorate of
this country 
wanted to 
""
Therefore certain structural adjustment  were absolutely needed
""
""
To my mind  in the
sense  which will pay
dividend 
""
Bold initiative was needed  has been
taken 
""
""
Uh pardon me for interrupting Mr Mukharjee now
""
Uh Dileep made a point and he says that 
uh at what budget has done in the public sector for instance  uh
uh 
""
The expectation was that  much more would be done
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If you look at the  and the
proposals in the budget  we have
done it 
""
Firstly  the area of operation of public sector has been limited
""
""
This investment  has been announced in
the  public sector would be made
 serve the social
""
""
Even  uh our
liabilities towards the interest  payment
""
I do agree 
""
But what can you do  ?
""
No finance minister can say  that he will not fulfill the
commitment 
""
Therefore  finance minister has made it quite clear in his
statement  that the distortions which have taken place will be ractified
""
""
Certain time will be needed 
""
""
limited 
""
Even 
non-planned expenditure is substantial 
""
And the budget has given a clear message what the government feels
""
""
""
Uh uh may I 
""
Deduction in non-planned expenditure  is something that I would
like to ask uh 
""
Uh may be we had a gap of information
""
So therefore you could clarify if we have gap of information 
""
Is that you said deduction in non-planned expenditure  is
down by four point nine percent 
""
And in the very next line  uh you go on to say that actually it
is down by over fifteen percent 
""
Now these are two uh 
that eleven point two percent went down on government uh  on the interest
payment 
""
""
Now let me explain  excluding
interest payment  in terms of the budget estimates for ninety-one
ninety-two  than the revised estimate
""
""
Now if we had introduced low  and expenditure
 had
continued 
""
Then the level would have which would have wished  uh is the
level from which have attend the fifteen percent production 
""
So fifteen percent is ex-hypothesis  four
point nine percent is with respect to  the non-planned expenditure of past
year
""
""
""
""
""
It is in a sense  phenominal
""
""
Because I think the budget says that  sixty-two
thousand  it would have reached had low
corrective been applied
""
""
That that refers to fiscal deficit 
""
""
May I 
""
""
You know I believe that the union budget for nineteen
ninety-one ninety-two  of the
crisis in the economy 
""
Micro economic imbalances 
""
The government has leaped beyond its means 
""
It has done so by borrowing at home 
""
The country has leaped beyond its means 
""
It has done so by borrowing abroad 
""
Now  that neither the
government  can afford to leap beyond its means year
after year 
""
""
But these are
""
""
Now
""
""
I am sorry I mean 
pace at which  is
being done fast enough 
""
At this point of time  the
adjustment could have been sweeped up 
""
The same incentive  is that as it
was 
""
When you  when the finance minister present his
budget 
""
""
I do not agree 
""
Look 
which is long over due 
situation 
""
""
 asking about the question I
think 
""
""
No  uh I believe that what we have achieved
in this year  which I hope
would lead to micro-economical stabilization during the current financial
year 
""
Let us not think in terms of the coventional budget deficit 
which is the borrowing  the short term borrowing of the government from
the 
""
Let us look at the revenue deficit  which is the difference
between revenue expenditure and the revenue received to the government 
""
Or the fiscal deficit  which is the difference between the
revenue received and the total expenditure of the government that is met by
borrowing 
""
Now what we have done this year  is to reduce both the revenue
deficit  as
compared to last year
""
But 
""
Now the fiscal deficit  by two
percent in point of G D P  crores
""
""
Dileep  that is very substantial
""
Now we are 
""
On one hand 
crores  that is both
progressive and non-inflationary 
crores 
""
""
So we come to  let us get quick comment
 then what Mr Nair said and then uh
""
""
""
No as far as the  forces of adjustment having begun I
certainly have no quarrel
""
But I think this 
""
The second factor we need to  look at in this budget is the
context in which it was written in a sense 
""
Meaning we have to make sure that we confirm  to certain needs
of 
that needs to have confidence in India 
""
The point that is some how seems to worry is that  worry
because the political will  is most when the crisis is
more secured 
""
And I do think that the backdrop of the  kind of manifesto that
the Congress had which before it came into power as you hear  allowed for
many of these changes 
""
Some of them are there in the industrial policy  some are there
in trade policy
""
But more could have been achieved is what I feel 
""
And if the pressure is off  pressure on
the ministry  in a sense to do this is to be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 view is repeated
in Hindi 
""
""
Vinod  industry and
uh 
""
Mr Loria what do you think uh  there are some confusing or uh
 encouraging signal for the corporate sector
for instance the deputation has been stuck 
""
Uh for instance the cooperation tax has gone up 
""
And then the three main fears of industry which was  in both
 uh the liquidity squeeze and which was
inflation  are still hanging over industry
""
So how do you expect industry  ?
""
""
Well I will put it this way 
""
Uh I I first like to make a very brief comment on what I think of
the budget 
""
""
""
""
""
And I 
""
But we have certainly not going to awaken every year  to a
brand new budget 
""
This has set the pace 
""
And I think  we will not wait for
this day with bated breath
