 In Hindi 
You know that's right
Today was uh suppose to have been the first day of brave new
India 
A day on which we were to radically restructure our our
economic policies
And therefore transit on to a high growth path after a short
period of painful adjustment on
And that was what it was supposed to be
How it turned out to be is really going to be our discussion
We are likely to have with us on the panel today people who have
been in one way or the other involved in this uh exercise to fashions
a brave new India
 I'll uh introduce them straight away 
Uh Mr Pranab Mukharjee deputy chairman of the planning
commission Mr Deepak Nair chief economic adviser of ministery of finance
Government of India Mr V K Loria is here as an a 
 consultant 
Also with us on the panel uh on our side of the panel is
in-house one word uh Dileep Cherian and therefore I'll
 take off by asking Dileep the first question
Dileep do you think uh the way the day has unfolded it was uh
 brave new India in the making ?
 I'm not entirely sure whether it's uh 
brave enough 
Sure Mr Manmohan Singh has done quite a few things that
this country desperately needs 
 It's certainly an economist kind of budget with lots
of political cheese cake thrown in 
But the budget has to be really seen in the backdrop of the
other major documents that was presented today which is the industrial
policy 
As it needed to address in some sense three or four
basic needs of the hour 
One the need for austerity 
Second a need to restore confidence in those who seek and
ought to invest in India 
And three to fashion as it were a completely new kind of
economy 
But to my mind the budget does do some other things that is
including these areas 
It certainly delivers as far as the capital market is
concerned 
I think it does some of the much needed reform to the money
market 
 I'm happy to see that defence expenditure has
been held at the level at which be held 
And a lot of the restructuring in the customs duties to my
mind move in the right direction 
But that's not enough 
I think it disappoints in certain other areas 
Uhm I am not entirely happy with what happened as far as the
public sector is concerned 
Neither an industrial policy nor as far as the budget is
concerned are enough signals being given as to what is going to happen in
that area 
Not enough is seen as far as curbing of conspicous consumption
 that has become a social problem in the country is going to be
done 
And I am worried about the signals that are sending out for
corporate investment 
And I think for some reason or the other perhaps for good
reason of his own Manmohan Singh seems to have been dissident on
three other areas 
One is on the business of N R I except for what he has
done as far as gifts are concerned 
This doesn't seem to be enough incentive for N R I's 
to invest back in India again 
I am concerned about the hesitation to hit at subsidies 
much much harder 
And I don't see enough effort in this whole belt tightening
exercise that we've been talking on for so long in tightening of
government expenditure 
So these to my mind are areas we ought to worry about 
There are two more areas that I would think cause concern
today 
I am worried about the kind of unchecked growth of interest
payment 
 It's forty-two percent now 
And Dr Singh says that it is going to go up to fifty percent
 if it's not checked by nineteen ninety-four nineteen
ninety-five 
And this would have been a very good time to get rid of
that burden of debt release to rural sector which seems to 
be uh costing the economy about for four thousand
five hundred crores in the three year period that we are
looking at 
These to my mind are areas of concerned today 
 A summary of Mr Cherian's view is repeated in
Hindi 
I see that uh Mr Mukharjee has got the congress
manifesto
Open to page twenty-two which says which says
 the economy uh Mr Mukharjee I'm sure you agree with
Dileep when he says that it delivers on A B M C 
But I'm sure you have uh difference with him when
 when he says that it's diffident disappoints
 and areas of concerned 
Uh firstly I would like to point out that budget
is one instrument followed with many other which reflects the 
 government's policy 
And particularly this year's budget is to be reviewed
 in the context of industrial policy resolution which has been
announced this morning 
Trade policy which has which was 
announced a little earlier and certain readjustment programme
which have been initiated by the government itself 
Congress as a party was committed to the electorate of
this country to restore balance in the economic system and 
wanted to put the economy on rate 
Therefore certain structural adjustment were absolutely needed
 if we wanted to come out of wood 
To my mind this budget is an adjustment budget in the
sense it has initiated a large number of message which will pay
dividend in course of time 
Bold initiative was needed and bold initiative has been
taken 
Uh pardon me for interrupting Mr Mukharjee now
Uh Dileep made a point and he says that he is disappointed 
uh at what budget has done in the public sector for instance uh
uh 
The expectation was that it would much more would be done
 Uh uh 
 I'm coming to that 
If you look at the industrial policy resolution and the
proposals in the budget you will find that what we committed we have
done it 
Firstly the area of operation of public sector has been limited
 and more areas have been open to private sector 
This investment in the public sector has been announced in
the budget and through these process public sector would be made
 more accountable competitive and it would serve the social
 obligation for which the public sector institutions are built up 
Even his comment in respect of the for instance uh our
liabilities towards the interest payment
I do agree that it is uh sizeably of high order 
But what can you do ?
No finance minister can say that he will not fulfill the
commitment by paying interest on the past borrowing 
Therefore finance minister has made it quite clear in his
statement that the distortions which have taken place will be ractified
 over the period of year 
Certain time will be needed 
 That's why this year's borrowing has been 
limited 
Even the reduction of non-developmental expenditure 
non-planned expenditure is substantial 
And the budget has given a clear message what the government feels
Uh uh may I may I just take up from uh there 
Deduction in non-planned expenditure is something that I would
like to ask uh Mr Nair this question 
Uh may be we had a gap of information
So therefore you could clarify if we have gap of information 
Is that you said deduction in non-planned expenditure is
down by four point nine percent if you exclude interest payment 
And in the very next line uh you go on to say that actually it
is down by over fifteen percent 
Now these are two uh is it is it 
that eleven point two percent went down on government uh on the interest
payment 
Now let me explain non-planned expenditure excluding
interest payment in terms of the budget estimates for ninety-one
ninety-two is four point nine percent lower than the revised estimate
 for nineteen ninety ninety-one 
Now if we had introduced low one word and expenditure
 non-planned expenditure has con had
continued in keeping with past trend 
Then the level would have which would have wished uh is the
level from which have attend the fifteen percent production 
So fifteen percent is ex-hypothesis so if you four
point nine percent is with respect to the non-planned expenditure of past
year
 So if you 
It is in a sense phenomi phenominal
 figure it's not a real figure 
Because I think the budget says that it's sixty-two
thousand crore rupees it would have reached had low
corrective been applied
That that refers to fiscal deficit 
May I 
You know I believe that the union budget for nineteen
ninety-one ninety-two must be situated in the wider context of the
crisis in the economy that is both acute and deep 
Micro economic imbalances lie at the root of this problem 
The government has leaped beyond its means 
It has done so by borrowing at home 
The country has leaped beyond its means 
It has done so by borrowing abroad 
Now I'm sure you would accept that neither the
government nor the country can afford to leap beyond its means year
after year 
But these are
Now
I am sorry I mean would you say that the kind of 
pace at which the adjustment of living beyond one's means is
being done fast enough 
At this point of time given the crisis we have the
adjustment could have been sweeped up and more substantive 
The same incentive and the same one word is that as it
was may not be there next year 
When you two words when the finance minister present his
budget 
I do not agree 
Look any further postponement of micro-economic adjustment 
which is long over due uh would make an exceedingly difficult 
situation 
 No I'm not asking about the question I
think two or three persons speaking together 
No not at all uh I believe that what we have achieved
in this year in terms of a credible fiscal adjustment which I hope
would lead to micro-economical stabilization during the current financial
year and continued fiscal consolidation thereafter is impressive 
Let us not think in terms of the coventional budget deficit 
which is the borrowing the short term borrowing of the government from
the Reserve Bank of India 
Let us look at the revenue deficit which is the difference
between revenue expenditure and the revenue received to the government 
Or the fiscal deficit which is the difference between the
revenue received and the total expenditure of the government that is met by
borrowing 
Now what we have done this year is to reduce both the revenue
deficit and the fiscal deficit not simply in absolute terms as
compared to last year
But in very substantial terms as a proportion of G D P 
Now the fiscal deficit is going to come down by two
percent in point of G D P that is about twelve thousand crores
 
Dileep that is not insubstantial that is very substantial
Now we are we're achieving this by two means 
On one hand you have revenue received two thousand 
crores of additional resource mobilization that is both
progressive and non-inflationary and two thousand five hundred 
crores a few words 
So we come to Mr Loria uh let us get quick comment
 Dileep on what Mr Mukharjee said then what Mr Nair said and then uh
No as far as the forces of adjustment having begun I
certainly have no quarrel
But I think this we didn't have very much choice 
The second factor we need to look at in this budget is the
context in which it was written in a sense 
Meaning we have to make sure that we confirm to certain needs
of the international community which is one of the potential lenders 
that needs to have confidence in India 
The point that is some how seems to worry is that I worry
because the political will to do change is most when the crisis is
more secured 
And I do think that the backdrop of the kind of manifesto that
the Congress had which before it came into power as you hear allowed for
many of these changes 
Some of them are there in the industrial policy some are there
in trade policy
But more could have been achieved is what I feel 
And if the pressure is off I worry that the pressure on
the ministry on the finance ministry in a sense to do this is to be
 reduced 
 Dileep let us now speak of uh some way 
 where you left off that 
 A few words yeah okay 
 A summary of Mr Mukharjee's view is repeated
in Hindi 
Vinod let's now get the voice of uh industry and
uh the professional sector 
Mr Loria what do you think uh there are some confusing or uh
 one can say not very uh encouraging signal for the corporate sector
for instance the deputation has been stuck 
Uh for instance the cooperation tax has gone up 
And then the three main fears of industry which was in both
 confession which was uh the liquidity squeeze and which was
inflation are still there are still hanging over industry
So how do you expect industry to react to this budget ?
Well I will put it this way 
Uh I I first like to make a very brief comment on what I think of
the budget I think it's one word 
 Sure 
And I it we may not be awakening to a brave new year 
But we have certainly not going to awaken every year to a
brand new budget 
This has set the pace it has set a new path 
And I think from next year onwards we will not wait for
this day with bated breath
