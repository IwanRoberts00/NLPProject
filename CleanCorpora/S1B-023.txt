You know  right
""
Today was  uh suppose to have been the first day of brave new
""
""
A day on which we were to  our
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
commission  Mr Deepak Nair chief economic adviser of ministery of finance
""
""
""
""
in-house  I'll
""
""
Dileep do you think uh  the way the day has unfolded it was uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
policy 
""
As it  three or four
""
""
One the need for austerity 
""
""
ought to invest in India 
""
And three to fashion  a completely new kind of
economy 
""
But to my mind  does do some other things that is
""
""
It certainly delivers  as far as the capital market is
concerned 
""
I think it does  to the money
market 
""
 has
""
""
And  to my
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that area 
""
""
 is going to be
""
""
And I am worried about the signals that are sending out  for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I don't see enough effort  in this whole belt tightening
exercise that  in tightening of
""
""
So these to my 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ninety-five 
""
""
""
""
""
looking at 
""
""
""
""
""
Hindi 
""
""
""
manifesto
""
Open to page twenty-two  which says
 sure you agree with
""
""
""
 disappoints
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
announced a little  readjustment programme
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh pardon me for interrupting Mr Mukharjee now
""
Uh Dileep made a point and he says that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
done it 
""
""
""
""
""
the  public sector would be made
""
""
""
""
""
""
I do agree 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
limited 
""
""
non-planned expenditure is substantial 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh may be we had a gap of information
""
So therefore you could clarify if we have gap of information 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that eleven point two percent went down on government uh  on the interest
""
""
""
""
""
ninety-two  than the revised estimate
""
""
""
 had
continued 
""
""
""
""
""
""
year
""
""
""
""
""
It is in a sense  phenominal
""
""
Because I think the budget says that  sixty-two
""
corrective been applied
""
""
That that refers to fiscal deficit 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The government has leaped beyond its means 
""
It has done so by borrowing at home 
""
""
""
""
""
Now  that neither the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I am sorry I mean 
""
being done fast enough 
""
""
adjustment could have been sweeped up 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Look 
""
situation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
would lead to micro-economical stabilization during the current financial
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now what we have done this year  is to reduce both the revenue
""
compared to last year
""
But 
""
""
percent in point of G D P  crores
""
""
Dileep  that is very substantial
""
""
""
On one hand 
""
progressive and non-inflationary 
""
""
""
So we come to  let us get quick comment
""
""
""
""
""
certainly have no quarrel
""
""
""
The second factor we need to  look at in this budget is the
context in which it was written in a sense 
""
Meaning we have to make sure that we confirm  to certain needs
""
that needs to have confidence in India 
""
""
because the political will  is most when the crisis is
more secured 
""
And I do think that the backdrop of the  kind of manifesto that
""
many of these changes 
""
""
in trade policy
""
""
""
""
the ministry  in a sense to do this is to be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 view is repeated
""
""
""
""
uh 
""
Mr Loria what do you think uh  there are some confusing or uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But we have certainly not going to awaken every year  to a
""
""
This has set the pace 
""
And I think  we will not wait for
this day with bated breath
