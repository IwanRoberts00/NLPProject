But along with freedom 
""
Laws and bye-laws for 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
world 
""
""
ideals ?
""
""
our constitution is based ?
""
Therefore we will consider  the salient features of the Indian
""
""
In nineteen forty-seven nineteen forty-six 
""
""
 based on the study of the various constitutions of the world our own
""
""
The Constituent Assembly was the large body
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
two 
""
""
""
""
No 
""
It could have changed 
""
Therefore they made  a a draft so that we could study the
""
""
""
""
""
and it had 
""
""
""
""
""
He had studied abroad 
""
""
""
""
""
And therefore he was chosen as the  uh the chairman for the
""
""
""
""
""
""
The Constituent Assembly published the constitution the draft of the
""
""
""
""
All the members of the drafting committees studied the draft 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore  with this process of bringing out a change for the
better finally the Constituent Assembly took into consideration all these
""
""
The Constitution of India was formulated 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And therefore we don't realize its importance 
""
""
""
""
""
So  some of the salient features of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
India  Constitution
""
We could consider it as an important introduction 
""
 consider it as an
important uh 
""
Why because  in the preamble lies the important principles for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
soverrignty of the people in the world we  the people of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
have his own constitution 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The people would change 
""
And therefore it was I  or I the Queen declares
""
""
There was nothing  uh any more like that to be
""
Therefore we the people  we adopt
""
""
That is why  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The second point that we see  are the different principles that
are enshrined 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sovereign 
""
""
""
""
preamble  and also of these basic principles which are there in the
""
""
Sovereign
""
""
India was not sovereign 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Also another aspect of this was that the people were not having their
own government 
""
""
""
""
""
""
India is free  indicating that no other country has any power over India
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sovereign means 
""
So it very plainly lays down  the principle of India being free
""
""
That is why the people  or the freedom fighters fought for
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore the first principle of being sovereign 
""
""
""
""
""
the world 
""
Socialism was uh  stipulating or bringing out the idea that all
people are equal and therefore  the land and the wealth
""
""
""
an individual 
""
""
condition  because of the condition of the masses which was very pathetic
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It was of that kind of socialism that we adopted 
""
The  the peculiar brand of socialism that we adopted the peculiar
""
""
Mixed economy means  that part of the economic activity in India
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All wealth of nations 
""
Therefore those railways  are natioanlized
""
They are the wealth 
""
""
""
They are for the need of all the people
""
""
is required by all is nationalized 
""
""
people
""
""
""
So therefore we have a mixed  economy
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Secular or secularism 
""
There are a few countries  which have a state
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now in a situation like this  the leaders were confronted with a
""
which religion should get importance  though there was a Hindu majority
""
""
""
""
So they opted for a secular state  will
""
""
favour the other
""
""
""
No religion is more important than the other 
""
Does not matter whether it has the majority  or a minority of
""
""
""
all could survive 
""
So that all would peacefully live as they have been doing for
""
""
""
""
""
""
surviving for the centuries  together and therefore it was thought that
they would continue to stay  in a secular state together as they had been
doing before 
""
The next ideal that we have 
""
Democracy as defined by  it's
""
""
the people 
""
""
a very ideal uh type of government 
""
Therefore whatever is done the people are responsible  whatever
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Socialism was there  a
""
of rich and poor in India
""
If socialism  uh if socialism was adopted in India as it was in
""
have been made economically different 
""
But in other matters it would have been different
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
republic 
""
""
""
""
""
make India a strong state is sovereign
