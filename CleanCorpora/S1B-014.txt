Begin the chapter The Indian Constitution 
In that we will be seeing the salient features of the Indian
Constitution 
Uh we know that India was not free 
Nineteen forty-seven August fifteen India became free 
But along with freedom we needed some framework of laws 
Laws and bye-laws for a better government 
The British had laws but they were laws more favourable to them 
So therefore we needed to make laws that are favourable to us
Therefore we will see the chapter the Indian
Constitution Cough 
When we talk about the Indian Constitution we are talking
about the ideals of the freedom-fighters 
The ideals of the people the ideals of the people around the
world 
That is why we are going to see in this chapter what are the
ideals ?
Or what are the ideas upon which our laws or our bye-laws or
our constitution is based ?
Therefore we will consider the salient features of the Indian
Constitution 
In nineteen forty-seven nineteen forty-six we had the 
Constituent Assembly or a group of people who would be studying the
various constitutions of the world and then formulating a constitution
 based on the study of the various constitutions of the world our own
constitution 
The Constituent Assembly was the large body
It was not possible that uh all people would take part uh
in the actual work of framing the constitution
Therefore a smaller body was formed a smaller body was taken
 known as the drafting committee 
The drafting committee had a specific task 
The drafting committee had a specific task
Number one of studying the constitutions of the world and number
two of forming or creating a draft of our constitution 
What we mean by a draft is not necessary that it is the final product
No 
It could have changed 
Therefore they made a a draft so that we could study the
Constituent Assembly could study the draft and then if they required they
would make the necessary changes before the final constitution could be made
The chairman of the drafting committee was Dr B R Ambedkar 
and it had a various members on it 
Dr B R Ambedkar was chosen because of many aspects 
He was uh good at law 
He had studied abroad uh he was an individual who was 
interested in uh the upliftment of the poor 
He was an individual who was involved in the reform uh in the
movement the national movement 
And therefore he was chosen as the uh the chairman for the
drafting committee whose main work was to prepare the draft studying the
various constitutions of the world 
Therefore the drafting committee collected the work of drafting
the constitution and placing it before the Constituent Assembly 
The Constituent Assembly published the constitution the draft of the
constitution throughout India 
All the members of the Constituent Assembly studied the draft 
All the members of the drafting committees studied the draft 
All the eminent people in India 
All the teachers and those who were really interested in the real
ideals and the future of the country studied the draft 
And there was a provision that any individual who thought fit 
that a certain change must be brought about in the draft wrote to the
Constituent Assembly 
They made their remarks 
They said something in favour and somethings against a particular
clause of the draft 
Therefore with this process of bringing out a change for the
better finally the Constituent Assembly took into consideration all these
suggestions and made the Constitution of India 
The Constitution of India was formulated 
The Constitution of India was applied 
The Constitution of India is in use 
But many a times we don't realize its important
We don't realize its salient features in our 
in other words important essential features of the
Constitution
And therefore we don't realize its importance 
We know it is there
But if we do not know what is in there ? Cough 
So we'll consider some of the salient features of the
Indian Constitution Constitution 
The first thing that we will consider is the preamble 
Preamble is the most important part of the Indian Constitution 
We could consider it as a a a magnacarta of the 
India Indian Constitution
We could consider it as an important introduction 
 We will we could consider it as an
important uh core of the Constitution 
Why because in the preamble lies the important principles for
which India uh is known for 
For which the Constitution was made 
For which the people of India fought for which we live 
Therefore the preamble is very very important 
Now we will see what is there in the preamble for us to jot down
 note offered to observe or study 
Number one 
The main thing that is stressed in the preamble is the
soverrignty of the people in the world we We the people of
India 
We the people of India formulate the constitution 
We the people of India make and adopt the constitution 
We the people of India have these ideas uh in our constitution
therefore it is not I previously we had monarchy a King would
have his own constitution at his uh whims and fancies 
He would have a constitution and based on that the country would
be ruled
But sometimes even they wouldn't follow what was said 
They would change constitution would change 
The people would change 
And therefore it was I I the king or I the Queen declares
such and such a thing
There was nothing uh any more like that to be
Therefore we the people we declared to ourselves we adopt
the constitution we have these ideals for ourselves 
That is why the power of the people is very much imposed in
we 
And that's a very important aspect 
Never before in India was such a principle stipulated
That is the basis of democracy 
We that's basis of uh our functioning now 
It was not there before
But it happened when we became free
Therefore the sovereignty of the people was established or
made clear in the preamble 
The second point that we see are the different principles that
are enshrined uh in the uh preamble 
Enshrined in other words mentioned in the preamble stipulated in
the preamble uh put forth in the preamble
And those principles are sovereign cough socialist
 secular democratic republic
 India to be India to be a
sovereign socialist secular democratic republic 
Now we will see what every word means 
So that we will have a better understanding of uh the
preamble and also of these basic principles which are there in the
preamble 
Sovereign
When we talk of the word sovereign we know that prior to independence
India was not sovereign 
In other words India was not free 
In other words someone else was ruling on our territory 
In other words the pre people 
were the subject and the rulers were someone else 
Also another aspect of this was that the people were not having their
own government 
There was one monarchy 
So all that was there prior to independence was different 
Therefore India was declared to be sovereign indicating that 
India is free indicating that no other country has any power over India
Indicating that India is free to make its own laws and its own
constitution 
That is why that word sovereign 
Sovereign means all powerful all powerful 
So it very plainly lays down the principle of India being free
 India being independent and that was very essential for us
That is why the people or the freedom fighters fought for
They wanted to be free 
They were not going to be satisfied with anything short of 
sovereignty
Therefore the first principle of being sovereign 
When we talk of the word socialist or socialism there was
socialism in the world uh when India was striving for freedom 
Socialism in Russia socialism in China and other parts of
the world 
Socialism was uh stipulating or bringing out the idea that all
people are equal and therefore the property the land and the wealth
of the country must be divided equally 
In that everything belongs to the state and nothing belongs to
an individual 
Therefore socialism because of India's specific
condition because of the condition of the masses which was very pathetic
in those days 
Therefore socialism was liken by the people of India
And therefore it was framed 
But the socialism that we adopted was not that of Russia or
China or not that kind where everything was owned by the nation 
where everything was nationalized 
Nothing was private 
It was of that kind of socialism that we adopted 
The the peculiar brand of socialism that we adopted the peculiar
kind of socialism that we had was mixed economy 
Mixed economy means that part of the economic activity in India
 would be nationalized and part of the economic activity in India
would be private 
Therefore all those important industries which are of national
benefit are nationalized 
Banks are nationalized mines are nationalized 
All wealth of nations 
Therefore those railways are natioanlized
They are the wealth 
They are for the importance of all the people 
They are for the need of all the people
Therefore those uh industries or that part of the economy which
is required by all is nationalized 
And that part which uh remains in the hands of the private
people
There are some industries which belong to the private people
So therefore we have a mixed eco economy
 
Nationalised economy and private economy
So our kind of socialism is not that which is likened to the
socialism in Russia or in China 
Secular is the next next uh ideal
that we have chosen 
Secular or secularism we might wonder what it is 
There are a few countries in the world which have a state
religion specially in the middle-east there is the state religion
But there are other countries who follow democracy which do not have
a state religion 
India was also a country which acquired independence in nineteen
forty-seven where there were important major religions in India 
Jainism Buddhism Hinduism Sikhism Christianity and so on and
so forth 
Now in a situation like this the leaders were confronted with a
dilemma or problem where they didn't know what to decide or
which religion should get importance though there was a Hindu majority
 there was a Muslim minority there was a Christian minority 
Therefore importance could not be given on the basis of religion 
So they opted for a secular state indicating that India will
not propogate any state religion that India is secular state
 that India will not be biased to favour one religion and not
favour the other
Therefore all religions are equal in the eyes of the state 
No religion is more important than the other 
Does not matter whether it has the majority or a minority of
followers 
Therefore this ideal of secularism was very favourable so that
all could survive within India 
So that all would peacefully live as they have been doing for
centuries 
The Hindus and the Muslims the Hindus Muslims and the Christians
These Hindus Muslims Christians Jains and the Buddhists had been
surviving for the centuries together and therefore it was thought that
they would continue to stay in a secular state together as they had been
doing before 
The next ideal that we have is democratic republic 
Democracy as defined by Abraham Lincoln it's
 a form of government where the power lies with the people 
 it's a form of govrnment which is of the people by
the people and for the people 
 A very a very uh a very ideal thought 
a very ideal uh type of government 
Therefore whatever is done the people are responsible whatever
is decided the people are responsible because it is for the benefit of
the people 
And the functioning of that gevernment will also be by the people
 uh with the method of election 
So a very ideal pattern that was choosen for India was democracy
Socialism was there a very a very a
very uh likeable ideal because there was a a difference
of rich and poor in India
If socialism uh if socialism was adopted in India as it was in
Russia or China perhaps the country country could
have been made economically different 
But in other matters it would have been different
Therefore they chose democratic republic 
We were free and we will rule the country that is why we the
people the sovereignty of the people 
Republic in that we had our own constitution 
We did not mean the uh the constitution of another country
to rule us 
But we formulated our own constitution therefore it was a democratic
republic 
Therefore it's a very balanced view that of the
constitution that we get in the preamble
We the people rule the country and those principles which will
make India a strong state is sovereign secular socialist 
democratic republic
