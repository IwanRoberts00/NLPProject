Begin the chapter 
""
In that we will be seeing the salient  features of the Indian
Constitution 
""
Uh 
""
Nineteen forty-seven 
""
But along with freedom 
""
Laws and bye-laws for 
""
The British had laws but they were laws more favourable to them 
""
So therefore we needed to make laws that are favourable to  us
""
Therefore we will see  the Indian
Constitution 
""
When we talk about  we are talking
about 
""
The ideals of the people  the ideals of the people around the
world 
""
That is why  what are the
ideals ?
""
Or what are the ideas upon which  or
our constitution is based ?
""
Therefore we will consider  the salient features of the Indian
Constitution 
""
In nineteen forty-seven nineteen forty-six 
Constituent Assembly  who would be studying the
various constitutions of the world  and then formulating a constitution
 based on the study of the various constitutions of the world our own
constitution 
""
The Constituent Assembly was the large body
""
It was not possible  uh
in the actual work of framing the constitution
""
Therefore a smaller body was formed  taken
""
""
The drafting committee 
""
The drafting committee had a specific task
""
Number one  of studying the constitutions of the world and number
two 
""
What we mean by a draft is not necessary that it is the final product
""
""
No 
""
It could have changed 
""
Therefore they made  a a draft so that we could study the
Constituent Assembly could study the draft and then if they required they
would make the necessary changes before the final constitution could be made
""
""
The chairman of the drafting committee was Dr 
and it had 
""
Dr B R Ambedkar was chosen because of many aspects 
""
He was uh 
""
He had studied abroad 
interested in uh 
""
He was an individual who was involved in the reform uh in the
movement 
""
And therefore he was chosen as the  uh the chairman for the
drafting committee whose main work was to prepare the draft  studying the
various constitutions of the world 
""
Therefore the drafting committee collected the work  of drafting
the constitution and placing it before the Constituent Assembly 
""
The Constituent Assembly published the constitution the draft of the
constitution throughout India 
""
All the members of the Constituent Assembly studied the draft 
""
All the members of the drafting committees studied the draft 
""
All the eminent people in India 
""
All the teachers  and those who were really interested in the real
ideals and the future of the country studied the draft 
""
And there was a provision that any individual who thought fit 
that a certain change must be brought about in the draft wrote to the
Constituent Assembly 
""
They made their remarks 
""
They said something in favour and somethings against  a particular
clause of the draft 
""
Therefore  with this process of bringing out a change for the
better finally the Constituent Assembly took into consideration all these
suggestions 
""
The Constitution of India was formulated 
""
The Constitution of India was applied 
""
The Constitution of India is in use 
""
But many a times we don't realize  its important
""
We don't realize its salient features 
in other  essential features of the
Constitution
""
And therefore we don't realize its importance 
""
We know it is there
""
But if we do not know what is in there ? 
""
So  some of the salient features of the
Indian Constitution 
""
The first thing that we will consider 
""
Preamble is the most important part of the Indian Constitution 
""
We could consider it as a 
India  Constitution
""
We could consider it as an important introduction 
""
 consider it as an
important uh 
""
Why because  in the preamble lies the important principles for
which 
""
For which the Constitution was made 
""
For which the people of India fought 
""
Therefore the preamble is very 
""
Now we will see what is there in the preamble  for us to jot down
""
""
Number one 
""
The main thing that is stressed in the preamble  the
soverrignty of the people in the world we  the people of
India 
""
We the people of India 
""
We the people of India make and 
""
We the people of India have these ideas  uh in our constitution
therefore it is not  a King would
have his own constitution 
""
He would have a constitution  and based on that the country would
be ruled
""
But sometimes 
""
They would change 
""
The people would change 
""
And therefore it was I  or I the Queen declares
such and such a thing
""
There was nothing  uh any more like that to be
""
Therefore we the people  we adopt
the constitution we 
""
That is why  in
we 
""
And 
""
Never before in India was such a principle stipulated
""
That is the basis of democracy 
""
We 
""
It was not there before
""
But it happened  when we became free
""
Therefore the sovereignty  or
made 
""
The second point that we see  are the different principles that
are enshrined 
""
Enshrined in other words mentioned in the preamble  stipulated in
the preamble  uh put forth in the preamble
""
And those principles are  socialist
 republic
""
 a
sovereign 
""
Now we will see what every word 
""
So that we will have a better understanding  the
preamble  and also of these basic principles which are there in the
preamble 
""
Sovereign
""
When we talk of the word sovereign we know that prior to independence
India was not sovereign 
""
In other words India was not free 
""
In other words someone else was ruling 
""
In other words the 
were the subject 
""
Also another aspect of this was that the people were not having their
own government 
""
There was one monarchy 
""
So all that was there prior to independence was different 
""
Therefore India was declared to be sovereign 
India is free  indicating that no other country has any power over India
""
""
Indicating that  India is free to make its own laws and its own
constitution 
""
That is why that word sovereign 
""
Sovereign means 
""
So it very plainly lays down  the principle of India being free
 and that was very essential for us
""
That is why the people  or the freedom fighters fought for
""
They wanted to be free 
""
They were not going to be satisfied with anything short of 
sovereignty
""
Therefore the first principle of being sovereign 
""
When we talk of the word socialist  there was
socialism in the world uh 
""
Socialism in Russia  and other parts of
the world 
""
Socialism was uh  stipulating or bringing out the idea that all
people are equal and therefore  the land and the wealth
of the country must be divided equally 
""
In that everything belongs to the state  and nothing belongs to
an individual 
""
Therefore socialism because of  specific
condition  because of the condition of the masses which was very pathetic
in those days 
""
Therefore socialism was liken by the people of India
""
And therefore it was framed 
""
But the socialism that we adopted was not  that of Russia or
China 
where everything was nationalized 
""
Nothing was private 
""
It was of that kind of socialism that we adopted 
""
The  the peculiar brand of socialism that we adopted the peculiar
kind of socialism that we had 
""
Mixed economy means  that part of the economic activity in India
 and part of the economic activity in India
would be private 
""
Therefore all those important industries which are of national
benefit 
""
Banks are nationalized 
""
All wealth of nations 
""
Therefore those railways  are natioanlized
""
They are the wealth 
""
They are for the importance of all the people 
""
They are for the need of all the people
""
Therefore those uh  industries or that part of the economy which
is required by all is nationalized 
""
And that part  remains in the hands of the private
people
""
There are some industries which belong to the private people
""
So therefore we have a mixed  economy
""
""
Nationalised economy  and private economy
""
So our kind of socialism is not that which is  likened to the
socialism in Russia 
""
Secular is the  uh ideal
that we have chosen 
""
Secular or secularism 
""
There are a few countries  which have a state
religion  there is the state religion
""
""
But there are other countries who follow democracy which do not have
a state religion 
""
India was also a country which acquired independence in nineteen
forty-seven 
Jainism  Christianity and so on and
so forth 
""
Now in a situation like this  the leaders were confronted with a
dilemma  or
which religion should get importance  though there was a Hindu majority
""
""
Therefore importance could not be given on the basis of religion 
""
So they opted for a secular state  will
not  secular state
 and not
favour the other
""
Therefore 
""
No religion is more important than the other 
""
Does not matter whether it has the majority  or a minority of
followers 
""
Therefore this ideal  of secularism was very favourable so that
all could survive 
""
So that all would peacefully live as they have been doing for
centuries 
""
The Hindus and the Muslims  the Hindus Muslims and the Christians
""
""
These Hindus Muslims Christians Jains and the Buddhists  had been
surviving for the centuries  together and therefore it was thought that
they would continue to stay  in a secular state together as they had been
doing before 
""
The next ideal that we have 
""
Democracy as defined by  it's
""
 by
the people 
""
""
a very ideal uh type of government 
""
Therefore whatever is done the people are responsible  whatever
is decided the people are responsible  because it is for the benefit of
the people 
""
And the functioning of that gevernment will also be by the people
""
""
So a very ideal pattern that was choosen for India was democracy
""
""
Socialism was there  a
very  a difference
of rich and poor in India
""
If socialism  uh if socialism was adopted in India as it was in
Russia or China perhaps the  could
have been made economically different 
""
But in other matters it would have been different
""
Therefore 
""
We were free  the country that is why we the
people the sovereignty of the people 
""
Republic in that we had our own constitution 
""
We did not mean the  constitution of another country
to rule us 
""
But we formulated our own constitution therefore it was a democratic
republic 
""
Therefore  a very balanced view that of the
constitution that we get in the preamble
""
We the people rule the country and  those principles which will
make India a strong state is sovereign 
democratic
