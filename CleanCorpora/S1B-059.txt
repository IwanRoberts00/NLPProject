<I>
Sir at the outset I wish to bring to the attention of
this house the dignity of the two institutions the institution
 of Rashtrapati and the institution the Governor of
the state
Sir Rashtrapati's address is an
address of the policy of the government that it will follow and
also the achievements of the government 
Sir political and economic stability are the two
sides of the same coin 
We cannot for one without the other 
Sir this government which came to power two and a half
years back was facing a political turmoil in the country 
What is this government even though a single party with
the largest members in this house was a minority government 
And we know the difficulties of running a minority
government which has to take a number of bold economic
decision 
But within two and half years we have proved that
this government taken taking bold
political decisions and economic decisions could attain majority 
Sir this is two and half years there is a political 
polarisation taking place in this country 
It is this political polarisation 
It is this political polarisation where anti communal
 forces and democratic forces coming together under the
leadership of the Congress party that has given
 a new political stability to the nation 
Sir this government has taken decisions on all subjects
 whether the government was in a majority or whether the
government was in a minority 
And for the Mandal issue we could find a solution in a
very democratic manner and all the backward communities in this
country are happy because they have got their due share in the
governmental machinery 
For about this Congress party has taken a
stand from the time of Pandit either this issue has to be
settled amicably by discussion between both the parties or the
course of law has to take its verdict and that verdict has to be deeply
seen 
Sir coming to the economic front we have taken very
bold decisions 
And you know when it came when it came to power two and
half years back what was the economic situation 
The inflation was at its highest up about seventeen
percent 
 The if the foreign exchange reserves was kept
 four thousand crores in two and half years back 
Now it has grown eight times more 
It is all around twenty-two thousand crores 
So situation the over all situation is very comfortable
This comfortable situation could be achieved because of the
drastic measures Congress has taken 
Sir in the seventy-nine prelinary session of the inter-national
conference at Tirupati Narsimharao has explained in
detail about the one word 
An important one or two words speech 
Since the beginning of the era of plan development the Indian
National Congress has been inspired and guided by the vision of
Jawaharlal Nehru 
He has strong sense of wisdom and deep understanding of the
 distinctive of the Indian resource let him to one or two words
 all topman approaches and evolved India all synthesis 
for the diverse influence which was inherently just humane 
pragmatic and uniquely Indian
The use of developed development planning was an
instrument to achieve this stand and ensure the material well
being of the masses and the dignity of the Indian 
So sir we have never deviated from two words 
And sir when our farmers are taking up this current
 we obliged in this house on one hand we have been 
one word what the political parties have been demanding that the
farmers should be given a regularising price 
There is no party in this house which has not demanded that 
Every party is demanding that the one or two words 
And when we give regularising price naturally it has to be 
passed on to the consumers 
In four one or two words exports enable to March
ninety-two ninety-three the growth of three point six percent April
to December ninety-two it was only three point five percent 
April to December ninety-three it has gone to nineteen point 
nine percent 
Now sir coming to the employment we have taken a number of
steps during last two and a half years 
The Jawahar Rozgar Yojana 
The Nehru Rozgar Yojana 
then other programmes other employment oriented programmes 
Yet there is the unemployment in the country 
Sir the achievement of scientists the achievement of in
the in our research field sir the the the the launching of the
 Agni is something which is tough and fearless 
 It's an achievement of a group of a community of
scientists who have been denied a number of facilities foreign
facilities foreign technology 
But within themselves they could they could find out
ways and means solutions so that today we are proud that Agni
 has been launched 
Just like the Agni has been launched in the space
 and I'm sure sir sir this government will be able to
give a new thrust to our one word a new thrust to our economic
structure a new thrust to our industrial strength so that there
is economic prosperity in this country then the peaceful the political
situation in this country
Only request is that all democratic forces should help us
 should support us this is my request 
I listened with care sir to the speech of my
honourable friend D S P Mathur as also the second of professor
Thomas 
I also read sir with great care the text of the speech
 which is really a not so much speech of the head of the
republic as it is in articulation of the governments view point
 also what they have done in the year gone by and what they
intent doing in the year that is facing us now 
So I could not help but carry an impression that the 
that the that its a its a tired and a desperated emotions 
A tired and desperated address 
It was it was uninspiring in content and I was struck by
the fact of the recourse that government could take of loading this
speech with the a great deal of anti-statistical assertions 
I found the address somewhat self-satisfied and 
one word 
The great deficiency that I find is the disharmony between the
assertions of government and uh what I have observed as a crippling
citizen that has one word many parts of national endeavour
 and national life 
There is an impression being different and impression that
is attempted 
An impression that was attempted to be created in the speech itself
 has been one word all to do as if some kind of an imaginary
 hump has been crossed 
Let me put it to the treasury bench if now through an
immorality through a performing of the participatory system of
government is through one word of defaction 
If through creating splits within one party after another you
have rearranged the arithmatic 
If you had simply rearranged the arithmatic let me division not
 in variety of thoughts that you have crossed some kind of an
imaginary hump and now rosy pastures upon the green pasture lie
ahead of you 
These are the first assertions that made by the Head of the
Republic and by the government is about the north-east 
These are his first assertions sir to create the situations
with regard to insurgency in the north-east has shown improvement
I do not know sir to what I should attribute such an assertion
 that insurgency in the north-east is improving when the
Governor of Manipur and Nagaland has himself without going into all the
quotation from his report to the president it might be again be
repeated the Governor of Manipur and Nagaland has said but
clearly amongst other things that the above state of intense insurgency
 and internal disorder and you would observe Mr Speaker sir that he
is not talking in the past tense 
He is talking of position as it exist in that part of the
country in the month of August to October of ninety-three 
The above state of intense insurgency and internal disorder is
due to lack of political stability and will lack of an overall
perception and monitoring of the worsening situation by the
governmental security forces over after long period 
You must have heard in the one word of government 
cannot be made by agency of government itself 
And if you want to argue sir that this civil citizen his
observation is limited to Manipur and Nagaland then at all I
am not convinced that the words that have been put into the mouth of the
 head of the Republic by the government 
I do not know to what I should attribute them 
Is it a step by the government to mislead the nation ?
Is it an attempt by the government to draw one word over
the reality in the wake of the situation that prevails in the north-east
 ?
Or is it is it an attempt to to denigrate the
institution of Parliament and to treat the entire exercise of the
 address to the joint session of the Parliament as a perfunctory exercise
of little importance fairly to a one word sir that the
situation that we face in the north-east is of extreme one word 
and the most extreme serious 
I one word in totality the assertion of the government 
that the situation in entire north-east is improving 
It has not improved 
And the sense of complacency about improving that the
government seems to be putting across is a very mislead sense and it
will be extremely challenging to the Republic 
Thanks oh thanks to very briefly mention just two or three aspects
of the current situation of Jammu and Kashmir 
There is an assertion made in the President's address 
And an assertion which suggests that it was the strength
displayed by the government in the unfortunate in incident
at Hazratbal which restrained the demonstrative itself through success
We have not yet sir not yet not till today the
Parliament has not authoritatively been told as to what actually happened
in Hazratbal 
The government has not yet come forward to tell 
I repeat that demand we must come to know what actually
transpired in Hazaratbal during that period 
How did the situation come about that the army was obliged
to take seige to that uh shrine ?
And what transpired when the siege was subsequently
attempted ?
What was the arrangement that the government made with the
seventy or eighty those who were in those that were inside the shrine
 ?
And how is it that when those that were inside the shrine 
when they surrendered whom did they surrender to ?
What was the role of the army ?
And how thereafter sir that out of those seventy or eighty that
surrender we do not yet authoritatively know what the correct figure is
There is not a single one now sir is in prison 
Not a single one is today charged as a serious terrorist
 meriting those serious try 
We were told that there are three or four or five 
I don't know how many foreign terrorists of foreign
nationality where are they now ?
And these are not small issues that the nation can just take
lightly 
I put it to you sir that in Hazratbal it was India's
 great good fortune which saved us 
That this government made every possible mistake in the
handling of the situation that it could have made and that is in
Hazratbal the siege finally got lifted and with those that were inside 
surrendered 
They did not surrender sir because of the so called 
patience shown by the government
They surrender because of certain chances which are entirely of 
recording broken 
It was incapacity incapacity to think incapacity to act 
miserable failure uh serious challenge to the nation as such 
I demand sir that unless the prospects of Hazratbal 
incident are shared with this house we will continue to hold I
certainly will continue to hold that in Hazratbal this government in
charge is making every possible mistake that it could have every
possible wrong that it could have for the nation 
And if the nation still survives it was not on account of anything
that the government did 
It was despite what the government did 
It is not a question sir of this disarray simply at the level
of Hazratbal 
It is a disarray that start from the top here 
That is disarray in decision making in the Union Home ministry
itself 
It is opened up we do not know dealing with Kashmir 
The honourable the home minister for home makes one
statement with certain assertion is definitely the honourable
minister for state makes an other assertion 
His excellency the Governor of Kashmir makes a third assertion
The army is left out on its one word they make
certain suggestions 
The security forces are left on the limp they make another
suggestion 
That disarray this total lack of coordinate arises not
simply in the metalistic sense 
It arises principally sir from the conceptual or a
 what is it that we are one or two words what is it this
government is trying to do in Kashmir ?
Where are we heading do you know sir ?
And I'll be happy if I'm proven wrong 
And I will I would demand of the government to share with
us the figures and to explain to us that if these are government one
word then how was such incident take place 
I demand of government to share with the house the reality of
what is taking place today in the district of Toda in one word
 in one word I demand of the government share with us
 what is taking place today by the raising of the head of insurgency
 in the district of Jammu in Udhampur 
I demand sir that this the government owes not just to the
Parliament this the government owes to the nation 
Unless the government share all this with us in this house
 the government stand charged of neglect a very great neglect of a
very great national priority 
And finally what about those three hundred thousand 
Kahsmiri pundit who in their own homeland so many
years after the raising of insurgency in their own homeland are homeless
No one can disappoint for them 
This government does not have time to even visit the camp
The pathetic plight of this three hundred thousand pundit
 for the last three to four years 
I charge this government for the most inhuman neglect of its
own citizen 
This is the most telling example of the blindness of this
government in the face of human misery 
Sir we have this yesterday celebration of presentation of the
budget 
I accept that this uh his address to the uh joint session of
the parliament is not a debate on the budget 
I am not going to even attempt that 
But because the speech of the President makes a reference 
to economic reform programme and suggests to the joint-session that
the economic reform programme of this government is really their answer 
to all the ill one or two words reflects the country
Therefore very briefly I consider it my uh obligation to
put to you my perception of where the government has brought the country 
Just look at four or five simple assertions that I will
take which are not assertions that I make uh one or two words they
call it a very one or two words 
These are the assertions that the honourable Union finance
minister has himself did
