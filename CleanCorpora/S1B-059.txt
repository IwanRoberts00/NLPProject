""
Sir at the outset  bring to the attention of
this house  the institution
 and the institution the Governor of
the state
""
Sir  is an
address  and
also 
""
Sir  are the two
sides of the same coin 
""
We cannot 
""
Sir this government  two and a half
years back 
""
What is  even though a single party with
the largest members in this house 
""
And we know the difficulties  a minority
government  economic
decision 
""
But  that
this government  bold
political decisions and economic decisions 
""
Sir this is two and half years 
polarisation taking place in this country 
""
It is this political polarisation 
""
It is this political polarisation  communal
 under the
leadership of the  that has given
""
""
Sir this government  on all subjects
 the
government was 
""
And for the Mandal issue  in a
very  and all the backward communities in this
country are happy  in the
governmental machinery 
""
For about this  a
stand  has to be
settled amicably  the
course of law  has to take its verdict and that verdict has to be deeply
seen 
""
Sir  very
bold decisions 
""
And you know  two and
half years back 
""
The inflation  up about seventeen
percent 
""
 was kept
""
""
Now it has grown eight times more 
""
It is all around 
""
""
So  is very comfortable
""
""
This comfortable situation  because of the
drastic measures 
""
Sir in the seventy-nine prelinary session of the inter-national
conference  in
detail 
""
An important 
""
Since the beginning of the era of plan development  the Indian
National Congress  and guided by the vision of
Jawaharlal Nehru 
""
He has strong sense of wisdom  and deep understanding of the
 one or two words
""
for the diverse influence 
pragmatic  and uniquely Indian
""
The use of developed development planning  an
instrument  the material well
being of the masses 
""
So 
""
And sir  are taking up this current
""
one word  the
farmers should be given 
""
There is no party in this house which has not demanded that 
""
Every party is demanding that the 
""
And when we give regularising price naturally 
passed on to the consumers 
""
In four  enable to March
ninety-two ninety-three  April
to December ninety-two it was only three point five percent 
""
April to December ninety-three it has gone to nineteen point 
nine percent 
""
Now sir coming to the employment  we have taken a number of
steps during last two and a half years 
""
The 
""
""
The 
then other programmes 
""
Yet there is 
""
Sir  in
the in our research field  the launching of the
""
""
 group of a community of
scientists  foreign
facilities 
""
But  they could find out
ways and means solutions  Agni
""
""
Just like the  has been launched in the space
 will be able to
give a new thrust to our  a new thrust to our economic
structure  there
is economic prosperity in this country then the  peaceful the political
situation in this country
""
Only request is that  should help us
""
""
""
I listened with care sir  my
honourable friend  as also the second of professor
Thomas 
""
I also read sir with great care  speech
 head of the
republic  governments view point
 and what they
intent doing 
""
So I could not 
that the 
""
A tired and desperated address 
""
It was  and I was struck by
the fact  of loading this
speech with the 
""
I found the address 
one word 
""
The great deficiency that I find  is the disharmony between the
assertions of government  what I have observed as a crippling
citizen  many parts of national endeavour
""
""
There is an impression  and impression that
is attempted 
""
An impression that was attempted to be created in the speech itself
 as if some kind of an imaginary
""
""
Let me put it to  through an
immorality  the participatory system of
government 
""
If through creating splits within one party after another  you
have rearranged the arithmatic 
""
If you had simply rearranged the arithmatic  let me division not
 that you have crossed some kind of an
imaginary hump and now  lie
ahead of you 
""
These are the first assertions that made  by the Head of the
Republic 
""
These are his first assertions sir  to create the situations
with regard to insurgency  has shown improvement
""
""
I do not know sir to what  I should attribute such an assertion
 when the
Governor of Manipur and Nagaland has himself  without going into all the
quotation from his report to the president  be
repeated  but
clearly  amongst other things that the above state of intense insurgency
 and you would observe Mr Speaker sir that he
is not talking in the past tense 
""
He is talking of position  in that part of the
country 
""
The above state of intense insurgency and internal disorder  is
due  lack of an overall
perception  by the
governmental security forces 
""
You must have heard in the 
cannot be made 
""
And if you want to argue sir that this civil citizen  his
observation is limited to Manipur and Nagaland  I
am not convinced  that the words that have been put into the mouth of the
""
""
I do not know to what I should attribute them 
""
Is it a step by the government to mislead the nation  ?
""
Is it an attempt by the government to draw  over
the reality in the wake of the situation  that prevails in the north-east
 ?
""
Or is it  to denigrate the
institution of Parliament  of the
 address to the joint session of the Parliament as a perfunctory exercise
of little importance  that the
situation that we face in the north-east 
and the most extreme serious 
""
I 
that the situation in 
""
It has not improved 
""
And the sense of complacency  that the
government seems to be putting across  and it
will be extremely challenging to the Republic 
""
Thanks oh thanks to very briefly mention just two or three aspects
of the current situation 
""
There is an assertion made in the 
""
And an assertion which suggests  that it was the strength
displayed by the government  incident
at Hazratbal  which restrained the demonstrative itself through success
""
""
We have not yet sir  the
Parliament has not authoritatively been told  as to what actually happened
in Hazratbal 
""
The government has not yet come forward to tell 
""
I repeat that demand  we must come to know what actually
transpired 
""
How did the situation come about  the army was obliged
to take seige  ?
""
And what transpired  subsequently
attempted  ?
""
What was the arrangement that the government made  with the
seventy or eighty  those that were inside the shrine
 ?
""
And how is it 
when they surrendered  ?
""
What was the role of the army  ?
""
And how thereafter sir that out of those seventy or eighty that
surrender  we do not yet authoritatively know what the correct figure is
""
""
There is not a single one now sir 
""
Not a single one  as a serious terrorist
""
""
We were told that there are three or four or five 
""
I don't know how many  of foreign
nationality  ?
""
And these are not small issues that the nation can just take
lightly 
""
I put it to you sir  India's
""
""
That this government made every possible mistake  in the
handling of the situation that it could have made  and that is in
Hazratbal the siege finally got lifted and with those that were inside 
surrendered 
""
They did not surrender sir 
patience  shown by the government
""
They surrender because of certain chances which are entirely of 
recording broken 
""
It was incapacity 
miserable failure 
""
I demand sir 
incident are shared with this house  I
certainly will continue to hold  that in Hazratbal this government in
charge  every
possible wrong that it could have for the nation 
""
And if the nation still survives it was not on account of anything
that the government 
""
It was despite what the government did 
""
It is not a question sir  of this disarray simply at the level
of 
""
It is a disarray that start from the top here 
""
That is disarray in decision making in the Union Home ministry
itself 
""
It is opened up 
""
The honourable  makes one
statement with certain assertion  the honourable
minister for state 
""
His excellency the Governor of Kashmir  makes a third assertion
""
""
The army is left out on its  they make
certain suggestions 
""
The security forces are left on the limp  they make another
suggestion 
""
That disarray  arises not
simply in the 
""
It arises  or a
 what is it this
government is trying to do in Kashmir  ?
""
Where are we heading  ?
""
And 
""
And I will  to share with
us the figures and to explain to us  one
word 
""
I demand of government  to share with the house the reality of
what is taking place today  one word
 I demand of the government share with us
 raising of the head of insurgency
""
""
I demand sir  that this the government owes not just to the
Parliament this the government owes to the nation 
""
Unless the government share all this  in this house
 of a
very great national priority 
""
And finally 
Kahsmiri  so many
years after the raising of insurgency in their own homeland  are homeless
""
""
No one can disappoint for them 
""
This government does not have time to even visit the camp
""
The pathetic plight of this three hundred thousand  pundit
""
""
I charge this government for the most  inhuman neglect of its
own citizen 
""
This is the most telling example  of the blindness of this
government 
""
Sir we have this yesterday celebration  of presentation of the
budget 
""
I accept that this uh his address to the  uh joint session of
the parliament 
""
I am not going to even attempt that 
""
But because the 
to economic reform programme  that
the economic reform programme of this government is really their answer 
to all the ill  reflects the country
""
Therefore very briefly I consider it my  to
put to you my perception of where the government has brought the country 
""
Just look at  that I will
take which are not assertions that I make uh  they
call it a very 
""
These are the assertions that the honourable Union finance
minister has himself did
