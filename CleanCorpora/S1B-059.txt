Sir  is an
""
""
""
""
sides of the same coin 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
political decisions and economic decisions 
""
""
polarisation taking place in this country 
""
It is this political polarisation 
""
""
 under the
""
""
""
""
""
government was 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
settled amicably  the
""
seen 
""
Sir  very
bold decisions 
""
""
half years back 
""
The inflation  up about seventeen
percent 
""
 was kept
""
""
Now it has grown eight times more 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This comfortable situation  because of the
drastic measures 
""
""
""
""
""
An important 
""
""
National Congress  and guided by the vision of
""
""
He has strong sense of wisdom  and deep understanding of the
 one or two words
""
for the diverse influence 
""
""
The use of developed development planning  an
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
And when we give regularising price naturally 
passed on to the consumers 
""
""
ninety-two ninety-three  April
to December ninety-two it was only three point five percent 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
then other programmes 
""

Just like the  has been launched in the space

structure  there
""
situation in this country
""
Only request is that  should help us
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 and what they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It was  and I was struck by
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There is an impression  and impression that
""
""
""
""
""
""
Let me put it to  through an
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
imaginary hump and now  lie
""
""
These are the first assertions that made  by the Head of the
""
""
These are his first assertions sir  to create the situations
""
""
""
""
""
Governor of Manipur and Nagaland has himself  without going into all the
quotation from his report to the president  be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The above state of intense insurgency and internal disorder  is
""
""
governmental security forces 
""
You must have heard in the 
""
""
And if you want to argue sir that this civil citizen  his
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
Or is it  to denigrate the
institution of Parliament  of the
""
""
""
""
""
I 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of the current situation 
""
There is an assertion made in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Parliament has not authoritatively been told  as to what actually happened
""
""
""
""
""
transpired 
""
How did the situation come about  the army was obliged
to take seige  ?
""
And what transpired  subsequently
""
""
What was the arrangement that the government made  with the
""
 ?
""
And how is it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not a single one  as a serious terrorist
""
""
""
""
I don't know how many  of foreign
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That this government made every possible mistake  in the
""
Hazratbal the siege finally got lifted and with those that were inside 
""
""
""
""
""
They surrender because of certain chances which are entirely of 
""
""
It was incapacity 
""
""
I demand sir 
incident are shared with this house  I
""
""
possible wrong that it could have for the nation 
""
And if the nation still survives it was not on account of anything
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
itself 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
certain suggestions 
""
The security forces are left on the limp  they make another
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
government is trying to do in Kashmir  ?
""
""
""
And 
""
And I will  to share with
""
word 
""
I demand of government  to share with the house the reality of
""
 I demand of the government share with us
""
""
""
I demand sir  that this the government owes not just to the
Parliament this the government owes to the nation 
""
Unless the government share all this  in this house
 of a
very great national priority 
""
And finally 
""
years after the raising of insurgency in their own homeland  are homeless
""
""
No one can disappoint for them 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
own citizen 
""
""
""
""
Sir we have this yesterday celebration  of presentation of the
""
""
""
the parliament 
""
I am not going to even attempt that 
""
But because the 
""
the economic reform programme of this government is really their answer 
to all the ill  reflects the country
""
Therefore very briefly I consider it my  to
""

Just look at  that I will

call it a very 
""

minister has himself did
