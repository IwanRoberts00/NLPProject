<I>
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
I am working as a teacher 
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
I am Joy  uh Kottayam Kerala a central part
of Kerala 
""
""
And uh you  last week when uh you came
from your own place  from the
""
""
Yes yes I came from  uh Nelambur
""
""
Nelambur
""
""
Uh
""
""
Oh then Nelambur comes somewhere in the northern part
""
""
Ah northern part of Kerala
""
""
Northern 
""
""
But it is a border district I believe
""
""
 border district
""
""
Between Karnataka 
""
""
 and Tamil Nadu
""
""
Oh I see 
""
""
So  uh
private college
""
""
Uh ha you teach in some uh higher secondary school
""
""
Yes I teach in 
""
But basically I am a mathematics teacher but  uh in my school I
teach uh English
""
""
Oh ho ho 
""
""
 in our
place  crops uh
agricultural crops are 
""
Then what about you  is it a village
or town ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
 village
""
""
Not uh big town a small town 
""
""
 ?
""
""
 rubber
 all
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh in our place no uh the main cultivation is rubber 
""
Usually in  I mean uh
 a place where you have we have maintained that uh uh
""
""
So you get uh  more income
""
""
But you know the  because
now-a-days more over though the labour charges have gone up  now the good
prices are  coming
""
""
 we
can't uh
""
""
 it
""
But the only advantage
""
""
We can't help it because the population
""
""
Only advantage is that uh  rubber is now enjoying a basic
price or something like that in a fixed price  which is uh almost good
""
""
Not that bad
""
""
So but actually we still remember the day 
years till a few years back  Kottayam was one of the most affluent the uh
places even in the whole of India 
""
""
Yeah  right
""
""
And you know educationally  by all means and
you know  the whole place
 we have access by roads
""
""
So we cannot say that it is in a 
""
We have a stationary ways etcetra etcetra
""
""
Uh ours is a remote area and our  uh
yes hilly area
""
Our people they are mostly depend on this agricultural products 
uh like uh pepper  uh tea
plantations 
""
These are the main crops we 
""
""
""
""
""
You have
""
""
Yeah we have 
""
And uh  backward
""
""
Ah uh 
""
""
Because most of the people  uh migrate to from southern
part of Kerala 
""
""
But they must be  I mean uh
good I mean families no 
""
""
They  we don't have enough uh facilities
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  is uh
""
""
So  educationally and
socially they are backward 
""
Actually they don't 
""
They want uh their own lives as it is
""
""
Ah I still remember 
that whenever  the people uh responsible people go to the uhm tribal
people  uh unwillingness to
come forward to mingle with the main stream etcetra is there
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
Now there are various projects I think  to give them for
 even then you know I personally don't uh uh agree
with many of the policy because you know  one way we are destroying their
natural habitat
""
""
""
""
""
Uh where they are used to
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Yes  true
""
""
And you know the days are gone when we could see we could
think of  forest and
""
""
Forest and uh they had a very good  life
""
""
Ah yeah  they have their own cultural I mean we destroyed
everything anyway whatever it is
""
So one way  I mean when we think about uh
this one of government policies are concerned  government have to bring
all the people to the  and uh uh what
time you have come ?
""
""
Uh today
""
""
What about your job and uh  family in Nelambur sir ?
""
""
Yes uh  as I told you everyting
""
""
You belong to that particular district
""
""
No no I belong actually to  uh Yernala district
""
""
Oh ho from Yernala
""
""
You see  settled in Nelambur
""
""
Uh then how do you 
""
""
Yeah my field of work is uh  I teach I told you know I was
I am teaching in one of the private colleges 
""
You see we don't have uh 
 run by me
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha ha
""
""
We don't have uh many  high
schools run by the government or  recognised by the government and
nominated 
""
 a migrated area
""
""
Yes  a boon to
your  uh progress and your people
""
""
In a way you can say
""
""
You provide certain education facilities for them 
""
""
Yeah uh 
""
""
A parallel college
""
""
Yes ah a parallel college
""
""
And uh who else is there to assist  you some other teachers
or employees
""
""
Ah to assist there some teachers are there  and uh together
we conduct the classes 
""
And there are many people 
because since there are no recognised uh aided uh colleges and schools uh
many in our area 
""
You see this parallel colleges they run a group
""
""
""
""
""
Yes of course
""
But still I have a doubt uh 
""
Actually these parallel colleges uh  are the main reasons for
the 
""
And uh actually they create a lot of problems uh in unemployment
uh
""
""
And uh after getting education they don't want actually to do
other work 
aga  agriculture
""
""
""
""
""
Yes especially the Indians have the  uh
tendency to keep away from  parrallel work and uh
""
""
""
""
""
Ah parallel work yeah 
""
""
Everybody wants a white collar job
""
""
White collar job
""
""
Yes this uh
""
""
""
""
So we have uh what you call this uh 
uh in our uh place  in plenty
""
So people 
""
""
Not only in your place everywhere in India  these
these  unemployment problem
""
""
""
""
""
The tendency to
""
""
So they seek 
""
But uh  one or two
words  the financial
background everything comes in the way 
""
Uh uh when we talk about these things  uh what do you feel
about the 
""
Is it necessary  is
it necessary in our country ?
""
""
So  a strong
uhm  maintenance of good standard of
English throughout  uh across this life
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
 the reason is
that  and
""
""
And uh and uh language see in India in particular  if a
country like ours  we need uh what you call a link language
""
""
Because uh 
lingual background  lingual background
""
""
""
""
""
Every state has uh  so in order to
communicate with them  uh I think
""
""
We must have uh a
""
""
Link languages  this English
""
""
Or in other words  if you
want to communicate with people from other cities you need to know around uh
ten fifteen languages 
""
Whereas if you know English you could serve  I mean it could
serve your  purpose throughout India and even outside the world
""
""
But actually the politicians spoil the  one or two words
""
""
""
Yes they actually spread the regionalism  communalism and
all
""
""
Because they have uh their own uh motives you know 
""
They have their own personal motives 
stand  for I mean their survival
""
""
Uh their survival 
""
""
And uh once such issues are out of the scene uh they cannot
 uhm I mean again for
something else or so 
""
""
So I think there are two sets of people I think 
""
One is favouring  English language and there are
other people who are
""
""
Those  against them
""
""
Against  them
""
""
Yes 
""
But when we consider the facts  uh we are supposed to follow
 uh we have another link language
""
""
Link language yes 
""
""
 important
""
""
Important 
""
But not only that 
""
""
""
""
""
If you want to  this is
the only uh  language by which we can communicate
""
Uh I mean  get the only material in English
""
""
In especially higher  higher
level 
""
""
""
""
""
What about the cultural uh uh  background in your place do
your people still 
like Kathakali Turgal etcetra in your place ?
""
""
Yes they do 
""
But even they are on the decline no
""
""
It is very you know in our place you know many of the items
are not uh there 
""
""
But it is because of the influence of this uh city culture
you know 
""
They are always after these 
""
""
Yeah that is the inevitable reality for example in our
childhood you know  I mean the school where I studied
our  uh uniform was the very much traditional Kerala
""
""
""
Now most of the schools in have changed to  one
word 
""
But I I feel it has become an inevitable uh 
""
""
That truth uh  the tradition of
uh European people uh 
""
""
But does this mean that you know
""
""
My sir I mean my guess is that you know people must have uh
""
""
""
No I don't think how can it be a convenient way because 
uh wearing these uh boots shoes ties
""
""
""
it's 
""
One way  true
""
 not hygenic especially during the month of June July
""
But you know still  sorry
there is an element of uh  uh foreign
traditions in every country 
""
""
Yes of course we can follow the language  European
languages  I mean this English
""
But 
""
""
 if we follow their culture uh
tradition 
""
""
But you know  see anyway English study is that has brought
a  whatever it is
""
""
Yes  then
""
""
I see what about the cultural no 
programmes and other items  there's
 a decline in your part
""
""
Yeah sure
""
""
And uh what is the reason behind it
""
""
Actually there the thing is that you know for example
Kathakali art I mean this 
it needs a life time 
""
For example six or seven years to master
""
""
Ha true
""
""
And you know 
that patient enough to practice it 
""
""
Even from our area know  entirely different
know  they wanted to study all these uh old uh
things  older things you know
""
""
Uh not only that uh  usually these days the people have a
tendency to look down upon such a traditional  uh
programme you know traditional  uh cultural programmes of
""
""
""
""
""
I see
""
""
That is the one of the main reason 
""
""
Uh people always go after pop music  uh dance cabarait
dance 
""
""
Of course this is well and good but should we 
yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
But in our area it is totally different
""
I think uh now people have 
they love to learn
