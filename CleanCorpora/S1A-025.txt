<I>
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I am Joy  uh Kottayam Kerala a central part
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes I teach in 
""
But basically I am a mathematics teacher but  uh in my school I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
place  crops uh
agricultural crops are 
""
Then what about you  is it a village
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 rubber
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
now-a-days more over though the labour charges have gone up  now the good
prices are  coming
""
""
 we
can't uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
price or something like that in a fixed price  which is uh almost good
""
""
""
""
""
So but actually we still remember the day 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And you know educationally  by all means and
""
 we have access by roads
""
""
So we cannot say that it is in a 
""
We have a stationary ways etcetra etcetra
""
""
""
yes hilly area
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  backward
""
""
Ah uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They  we don't have enough uh facilities
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They want uh their own lives as it is
""
""
Ah I still remember 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Yes  true
""
""
And you know the days are gone when we could see we could
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
everything anyway whatever it is
""
So one way  I mean when we think about uh
this one of government policies are concerned  government have to bring
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What about your job and uh  family in Nelambur sir ?
""
""
""
""
""
You belong to that particular district
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh then how do you 
""
""
""
""
""
You see we don't have uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha ha
""
""
We don't have uh many  high
""
nominated 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
or employees
""
""
""
we conduct the classes 
""
""
because since there are no recognised uh aided uh colleges and schools uh
many in our area 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But still I have a doubt uh 
""
Actually these parallel colleges uh  are the main reasons for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
aga  agriculture
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Everybody wants a white collar job
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh in our uh place  in plenty
""
So people 
""
""
""
these  unemployment problem
""
""
""
""
""
The tendency to
""
""
So they seek 
""
But uh  one or two
""
background everything comes in the way 
""
Uh uh when we talk about these things  uh what do you feel
""
""
Is it necessary  is
it necessary in our country ?
""
""
""
uhm  maintenance of good standard of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that  and
""
""
""
country like ours  we need uh what you call a link language
""
""
""
lingual background  lingual background
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We must have uh a
""
""
Link languages  this English
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
serve your  purpose throughout India and even outside the world
""
""
But actually the politicians spoil the  one or two words
""
""
""
Yes they actually spread the regionalism  communalism and
""
""
""
""
""
They have their own personal motives 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I think there are two sets of people I think 
""
One is favouring  English language and there are
""
""
""
Those  against them
""
""
Against  them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 important
""
""
Important 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In especially higher  higher
""
""
""
""
""
""
What about the cultural uh uh  background in your place do
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are not uh there 
""
""
But it is because of the influence of this uh city culture
you know 
""
They are always after these 
""
""
""
childhood you know  I mean the school where I studied
our  uh uniform was the very much traditional Kerala
""
""
""
""
""
""
But I I feel it has become an inevitable uh 
""
""
That truth uh  the tradition of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh wearing these uh boots shoes ties
""
""
""
it's 
""
""
""
 not hygenic especially during the month of June July
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But 
""
""
 if we follow their culture uh
tradition 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see what about the cultural no 
""
""
""
""
Yeah sure
""
""
And uh what is the reason behind it
""
""
Actually there the thing is that you know for example
""
""
""
For example six or seven years to master
""
""
Ha true
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
things  older things you know
""
""
Uh not only that uh  usually these days the people have a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
yeah 
""
""
