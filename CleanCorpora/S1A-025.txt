<I>
Yes I am from Kerala 
 I'm Kuriachan 
I am working as a teacher in a school 
Yes sir I'm Anthony 
I am Joy Joseph from uh Kottayam Kerala a central part
of Kerala and uh I am here on a special uh session 
And uh you one word last week when uh you came
from your own place from the
Yes yes I came from uh Nelambur
Nelambur
Uh
Oh then Nelambur comes somewhere in the northern part
Ah northern part of Kerala
Northern 
But it is a border district I believe
 It's border district
Between Karnataka and uh 
 Between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
Oh I see 
So I'm teaching there uh in one of the uh
private college
Uh ha you teach in some uh higher secondary school
Yes I teach in in some higher secondary 
But basically I am a mathematics teacher but uh in my school I
teach uh English
Oh ho ho it's fantastic job you are doing no 
 It's it's a rainy season in our
place and we have plenty of rain this year so our crops uh
agricultural crops are very good 
Then what about you sir uh in your village is it a village
or town ?
Yes it's a village 
 It's village
Not uh big town a small town 
 What's the main cultivation there ?
 It's paddy and then uh rubber
 rubber and uh maize that's all
 And 
 Rubber 
Uh in our place no uh the main cultivation is rubber 
Usually in Ke Kottayam is supposed to be the I mean uh
 a place where you have we have maintained that uh uh
So you get uh more income
But you know the pro uh recent uh trends because
now-a-days more over though the labour charges have gone up now the good
prices are not coming
 Oh that's everywhere in Kerala we
can't uh
 That's it
But the only advantage
We can't help it because the population
Only advantage is that uh rubber is now enjoying a basic
price or something like that in a fixed price which is uh almost good
Not that bad
So but actually we still remember the day one word 
years till a few years back Kottayam was one of the most affluent the uh
places even in the whole of India 
Yeah that's right
And you know educationally culturally by all means and
you know uh or uh our area I mean the who the whole place
 it's almost cultivable cultivated and uh we have access by roads
 trains and one word 
So we cannot say that it is in a one word 
We have a stationary ways etcetra etcetra
Uh ours is a remote area and our people uh
yes hilly area
Our people they are mostly depend on this agricultural products 
uh like uh pepper paddy uh then coffee coffee seeds uh tea
plantations 
These are the main crops we we 
 Hilly region 
You have
Yeah we have 
And uh educationally our area is very backward
Ah uh 
Because most of the people uh migrate to from southern
part of Kerala 
But they must be uh be belonging to some I mean uh
good I mean families no 
They a few words we don't have enough uh facilities
 for education and or plant rotation 
 Facilities that should be arranged 
 One word is there 
And uh a very good percentage of our population is uh
 uh tribe 
So they are backwardly you know they are educationally and
socially they are backward 
Actually they don't want to live with us 
They want uh their own lives as it is
Ah I still remember I was told by some social workers 
that whenever the people uh responsible people go to the uhm tribal
people they are show their uh uhm what to say uh unwillingness to
come forward to mingle with the main stream etcetra is there
Yes yes
Now there are various projects I think to give them for
 a main stream even then you know I personally don't uh uh agree
with many of the policy because you know one way we are destroying their
natural habitat
 Yes uh there are uh yes 
Uh where they are used to
Yeah
Yes that's true that's true
And you know the days are gone when we could see we could
think of uh people bringing honey etcetra from the forest and
Forest and uh they had a very good life
Ah yeah they have their own cultural I mean we destroyed
everything anyway whatever it is
So one way it's a good I mean when we think about uh
this one of government policies are concerned government have to bring
all the people to the main stream or whatever it is and uh uh what
time you have come ?
Uh today
What about your job and uh family in Nelambur sir ?
Yes uh as I told you everyting
You belong to that particular district
No no I belong actually to uh Yernala district
Oh ho from Yernala
You see I'm settled in Nelambur
Uh then how do you a few words work 
Yeah my field of work is uh I teach I told you know I was
I am teaching in one of the private colleges 
You see we don't have uh it's run by you 
 it's run by me
 It's run by you 
Ah ha ha
We don't have uh many regular colleges or any high
schools run by the government or recognised by the government and
nominated 
 It's a migrated area
Yes so this a boon your step it's a boon to
your uh progress and your people
In a way you can say
You provide certain education facilities for them 
Yeah uh see I am actually running a parallel college 
A parallel college
Yes ah a parallel college
And uh who else is there to assist you some other teachers
or employees
Ah to assist there some teachers are there and uh together
we conduct the classes 
And there are many people uhm many people 
because since there are no recognised uh aided uh colleges and schools uh
many in our area 
You see this parallel colleges they run a group
 Uhm 
Yes of course
But still I have a doubt uh 
Actually these parallel colleges uh are the main reasons for
the uh melting of so many graduates in India 
And uh actually they create a lot of problems uh in unemployment
uh
And uh after getting education they don't want actually to do
other work other work uh like uh what uhm you call 
aga agriculture
 Other work 
Yes especially the Indians have the uh uh
tendency to keep away from parrallel work and uh
 Tendency 
Ah parallel work yeah 
Everybody wants a white collar job
White collar job
Yes this uh
 It's a big problem 
So we have uh what you call this uh unemployment problem 
uh in our uh place in plenty
So people wanted to go abroad in search of jobs 
Not only in your place everywhere in India these
these unemployment problem
 Ah yes uh 
The tendency to
So they seek job in other countries 
But uh to go abroad uh it is very difficult one or two
words because uh the problem of language the financial
background everything comes in the way 
Uh uh when we talk about these things uh what do you feel
about the standard of English 
Is it necessary these English education is necess is
it necessary in our country ?
So that's a one word I'm a strong
uhm arguer for the main maintenance of good standard of
English throughout uh across this life
Yes yes
 Because because the reason is
that it's a world language you know and
And uh and uh language see in India in particular if a
country like ours we need uh what you call a link language
Because uh our country has a multi uh 
lingual background lingual background
 Lingual background 
Every state has uh their own languages so in order to
communicate with them uh I think
We must have uh a
Link languages and we usually depend on this English
Or in other words uh if you don't know English if you
want to communicate with people from other cities you need to know around uh
ten fifteen languages 
Whereas if you know English you could serve I mean it could
serve your purpose throughout India and even outside the world
But actually the politicians spoil the one or two words
 I think so 
Yes they actually spread the regionalism communalism and
all
Because they have uh their own uh motives you know 
They have their own personal motives uhm they have to 
stand for I mean their survival
Uh their survival 
And uh once such issues are out of the scene uh they cannot
 have any thing to to go to the people uhm I mean again for
something else or so 
So I think there are two sets of people I think 
One is favouring uh this uh English language and there are
other people who are
Those who're against them
Against them
Yes that's true 
But when we consider the facts uh we are supposed to follow
 this English language as long as uh we have another link language
Link language yes 
 That's very important
Important 
But not only that for our higher studies uh purposes 
 One word 
If you want to go through any material this is
the only uh language by which we can communicate
Uh I mean uh we'll get the only material in English
In especially higher upper higher school higher
level 
 Upper higher school 
What about the cultural uh uh background in your place do
your people still uh maintain that uh traditional cultural programmes 
like Kathakali Turgal etcetra in your place ?
Yes they do 
But even they are on the decline no
It is very you know in our place you know many of the items
are not uh there 
But it is because of the influence of this uh city culture
you know 
They are always after these uh so called modernism 
Yeah that is the inevitable reality for example in our
childhood you know even uh my own I mean the school where I studied
our I mean usual uh uniform was the very much traditional Kerala
 mundu and uh shirt 
Now most of the schools in have changed to uh uh one
word 
But I I feel it has become an inevitable uh 
That truth uh and we blindly follow the tradition of
uh European people uh 
But does this mean that you know
My sir I mean my guess is that you know people must have uh
 chosen a convenient way rather than uh 
No I don't think how can it be a convenient way because 
uh wearing these uh boots shoes ties
 It's a one word you mean uh that 
it's not at all suited for Kerala's climate uh 
One way it's true
 It's not hygenic especially during the month of June July
But you know still more than that uh cough sorry
there is an element of uh imitation or uh going after the uh foreign
traditions in every country 
Yes of course we can follow the language European
languages I mean this English
But the practice being 
 But the practice if we follow their culture uh
tradition 
But you know see anyway English study is that has brought
a number of good things to India and whatever it is
Yes then
I see what about the cultural no see the cultural uh 
programmes and other items uh Mr Joy you said that uh the there's
 a decline in your part
Yeah sure
And uh what is the reason behind it
Actually there the thing is that you know for example
Kathakali art I mean this uh uhm cultural items like Kathakali Turgal 
it needs a life time I mean uh mean practice 
For example six or seven years to master
Ha true
And you know nobody is nobody is 
that patient enough to practice it 
Even from our area know it's entirely different
know that people they like they wanted to study all these uh old uh
things older things you know
Uh not only that uh usually these days the people have a
tendency to look down upon such a traditional yeah yeah uh
programme you know traditional uh cultural programmes of
 Yeah yeah 
I see
That is the one of the main reason 
Uh people always go after pop music uh dance cabarait
dance uh and all those those things 
Of course this is well and good but should we 
yeah that's not uh our own 
 Yeah 
But in our area it is totally different
I think uh now people have uh more liking or you can say 
they love to learn uh Kathakali Bharatnatyam and uh see people do
