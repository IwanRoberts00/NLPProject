Hello 
Hello Lokesh how do you do
Well I'm fine
How do you do 
Fine okay thank you 
Hello
Hello 
Hello you 
 I'm from Tamil Nad 
I see
And I am a post graduate teacher 
Trained teacher though I'm still uh unemployed 
uh uhm what is the actual situation PG situation PG unemployed
graduates are are really a lot of person
PG graduates in the Karnataka unemployed
You mean uh unemployed
Yeah 
Ah yes of course that's a uh national problem in
India you know growing unemployment 
There are uh so many unemployed graduates 
That is true of uh Karnataka also 
What do you say Mr Mohan
Yes I agree with him 
Uh but with a some difference you know 
Uh those who have done their MA in English uhm in India find
jobs easily
 Haan 
Though the government uhm there is trying to uhm 
sneeze they give less importance to teaching of English in 
schools and colleges
 Yes 
Yes 
So another major problem
Had you had we studied uh in my case I opted for science subjects
 you'd have got easily the job 
But uh any major self-employment project is uh launched
here in your state 
Oh yes there are many self-employments schemes
Right
Like uh District Industries Corporation industries
 there is uh one corporation called uh Karnataka State Financial
Corporation
 Industries 
In the district industrial corporation which we call D I C
 uh you can get a loan to a tune of thirty-five thousand and
start any small scale industries
Home industries also
Yes that's right
We too have the same organisation 
We also have that thing
But when we approach since uh it seems they they uh
put lot of conditions yes that you fed up with those people
and uh
 Yes 
 Haan haan that is one of the 
puts a lot of strain that's one of the reasons why these uh
you know schemes have failed
 Puts a lot of strain 
Uh they there are so many legalities uh to perform and
all kinds of official disturbances well that's true
Yes I I should say that the Government should take
steps to liberalise those things 
 There're so many things which you cannot say bring
 all at a time 
Uhm uhm advancing loan uhm but you keep a track of how it
is utilizing it you know 
But lot of uh in fact on the government part also 
sometimes it seems right because in our state more than thirty uh
three hundred crore rupees have been uh given as
loan and not a single money has been recovered from the uh 
people who got it as loan
Loanees
Uhm they're not willing to when 
when they get the money as loans they have the feeling 
 it's it's donation for them
Right
With the result they do not allowance any further
 uh programmes
 You you mean to say that they do
not utilize uh uh
The funds
Yes the funds properly 
Properly uhm because it does not reach the
man there're lot of brokers ha right there in
interim period
It uh the half of the amount goes supposing if they give
loans for cattles doctors will get some amount or the man who
recommends and above all there is a fixed limit for uh every village
So two or three members will be getting right 
Those who have the influence uh and they'll have to
 approach back-door way to the local uh ruling party uh members
 Uhm 
 Ha right 
 Right 
Right 
Hey even in our state people say it is same 
But what I feel is as you said the funds are misused 
Yeah
You know
Yeah
You cannot put all the blame on one party 
No I
That is the receiver
Yeah yeah
You know
Of course but uh I don't blame one party
Then the banks the institutions which have advanced loan
 have to keep a proper track 
Right
Of for instance and see whether the loan is
being utilised properly
 For instance 
Properly
Uhm and there are considerations also uhm suppose as
you said in the case of the cattle most of the Indian cattle this
they die uhm uhm as soon as they are bought laughter 
you know
Uhm something should be done means the 
the basic thing is that we should educate our people 
 Uhm uhm 
We should tell them why the government
 We yes 
Not only that awareness is created among the people
Yes that's right awareness is an 
 as important
And as you can see uh unemployed graduates have
become or becoming rather are becoming terrorists anti-social
elements etcetra etcetra why
Because of frustrations you know 
They are frustrated disappointed 
And proper awareness is not created among them
Naturally they go astray 
Right
Yeah my feeling is but to some extent the
unemployed unemployment problem could be solved by this kind of uh
projects though if uh it has proved to be a failure 
Right
 A few words 
What we have got to do is a kind of introspections 
We should see uhm how how many people uhm have really been
benefitted uhm
Why uhm the scheme has been a failure
So after that say you can revamp your programmes 
and there is every scope you know uh for say improvement in the
 yeah scope
 Right 
 Yeah 
But the government does not
But as far as I think the government should take 
some hard steps towards those who misuse the funds 
But you know there are too many uh people interfering in
it
Yeah
Uhm and uh even our few politicians they simply 
they announce uhn
And they never keep up their words
Subsidies uh
Right
Yes you don't have to pay ten thousand rupees
 loan you don't have to pay five thousand rupees 
loan 
 And uh 
 Just for the political game
Yeah yeah
We become allured
Ha right
That is the unemployed's plight
Yeah yeah
And 
And the government does not
And once given that should become a tri 
tradition that's what we think
Yes yes 
And that has been happening
Yeah
Uh alright uh now what's your plan since you are
an unemployed 
Every city two words but the thing is for
the past years I I did not uh uh concentrate on uh making the
best use of the modern techniques of agriculture
Uhm uhm
The same traditional methods followed 
And it proved proved to be futile attempt 
Every year some natural calamities and this and that it
happens and uh you just you are surviving and we don't seem to
 have gained any 
Well uh fortunately for you here is Mr Mohan he is an
agriculturist a BSc Agriculturist graduate you can take suggestions
from him
Yes you are welcome
I no no
You can adopt
I see
The modern ways of agriculture uhm uhm 
And if you want say financial help without any say
 uh mediators and all uhn Mr Lokesh is here to guide you how you
could get loan uhm
He only will tell you uh the proper way to approach the bank
 Uhm 
I I think we have uh degressed from our uh uh subject
Infact our subject was unemployment
And I think this could be one of the solutions you know 
If uh these graduate people who own lands can go back to
their lands and right uh adopt new techniques
 Right 
Right
And try to contribute uh to our country in terms of
you know food food grains 
Well I think it'll help a lot and uh
In fact it is a social service also
Right
And uh so far people are under impression that white
collar jobs are the only aims and ambitions in life 
 That's true 
So shall we have a cup of tea 
I think it's better 
Oh yes yes
Fine
 One or two words 
No not yet it's very hot that
I see
In fact when I was uh from my native I could notice
the difference in climate when we are on the way
 Haan 
More than uh two hundred miles across the Salem 
Uhm I know
I I was able to notice Salem the difference
 Salem 
Is Salem an industrial city
I think I'm told yeah it's an
industrial city
 Yeah 
Yeah
 It's an industrial city
 Salem Salem 
 Industrial city 
Today I received a letter from my wife 
She has written it's cloudy there in my place Dharwar

University and see

willing to or wishing to implement new techniques and all those
things all right

 One or two words 
By the by I wanted to know about uh this politics in your
state because uh your Chief Minister is very much in news 
Uhm she was a film actress formerly yeah yeah 
isn't she
So what do you feel about her administration in your state 
 Yeah yeah 
Her administration one or two words she still enjoys
the public uh
Support
Support but as as an administra administrator
 I don't find she is really
 She's losing her popularities
No not yet still she enjoys it
 Haan 
But in the course of time once uh I I I that could be
 told only
I see 
During the course of time 
Uh as we read
Because there is no uh yeah equal an opponent to 
oppose her 
Right there is no good opposition she has
almost become a dictator
 Right no opponents 
In fact she enjoys the popularity just because there is
no opposition leader
Right
Who merits attention of the public
Exactly 
Oh
Exactly and what about Karunanidhi the former
Chief Minister
 That is 
Yes yes he is not
Is he completely silenced now
Yeah at present but ah now he has
gained slightly upper hand even though one word 
And totally uh among the number of the voters concerned
 he's still enjoying the sizeable uh support 
support
 Ah 
 Support
