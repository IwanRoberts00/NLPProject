Hello 
""
""
Hello  how do you do
""
""
Well  fine
""
How do you do 
""
""
Fine 
""
""
Hello
""
""
Hello 
""
""
Hello you 
""
""
""
""
""
I see
""
""
And I am a post graduate teacher 
""
Trained teacher though 
uh  PG unemployed
graduates are  person
""
PG graduates  unemployed
""
""
You mean uh unemployed
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Ah yes of course  uh national problem in
India you know 
""
There are 
""
That is true of uh Karnataka also 
""
What do you say Mr Mohan
""
""
Yes I agree with him 
""
Uh but 
""
Uh those who have done their MA in English uhm  in India find
jobs easily
""
""
""
""
""
Though the government uhm 
sneeze 
schools  and colleges
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
So another major problem
""
Had you had we studied uh in my case I opted for science subjects
""
""
But uh any  uh launched
here in your state 
""
""
Oh yes there are many self-employments schemes
""
""
Right
""
""
Like uh District Industries Corporation  industries
 there is uh one corporation called uh Karnataka State Financial
Corporation
""
""
""
""
""
In the district industrial corporation which we call  D I C
 and
start any small scale industries
""
""
Home industries also
""
""
Yes  right
""
""
We too have the same organisation 
""
We also have that thing
""
But when we approach  they uh
put lot of conditions  that you fed up with those people
and uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
puts a lot of strain  uh
you know schemes have failed
""
""
""
""
""
Uh they there are so many legalities  and
all kinds of official disturbances  true
""
""
Yes I  the Government should take
steps to liberalise those things 
""
 say bring
""
""
Uhm uhm advancing loan  how it
is utilizing it you know 
""
""
But lot of 
sometimes it seems right  uh
three hundred  uh given as
loan 
people who got it as loan
""
""
Loanees
""
""
Uhm 
when 
 donation for them
""
""
Right
""
""
With the result  allowance any further
 uh programmes
""
""
 mean to say that they do
not  utilize uh uh
""
""
The funds
""
""
Yes the funds properly 
""
""
Properly  because it does not reach the
man  there in
interim  period
""
It  supposing if they give
loans for  or the man who
recommends  uh every village
""
""
So two or three members will be getting 
""
Those who have the influence  have to
 uh members
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
Hey even in our state 
""
But what I feel is 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You know
""
""
Yeah
""
""
You cannot put all the blame on one party 
""
""
No I
""
""
That is the receiver
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
You know
""
""
Of course but uh  I don't blame one party
""
""
Then the banks  the institutions which have advanced loan
""
""
""
Right
""
""
Of  and see whether the loan is
being utilised properly
""
""
""
""
""
Properly
""
""
Uhm  suppose as
you said in the case of the cattle  this
they die 
you know
""
Uhm 
the 
""
""
""
""
""
We should  the government
""
""
""
""
""
Not only that  awareness is created among the people
""
""
Yes 
 important
""
""
And as you can see  have
become  anti-social
elements etcetra etcetra why
""
Because of frustrations 
""
They are frustrated 
""
And proper awareness is  among them
""
Naturally 
""
Right
""
""
Yeah  the
unemployed unemployment problem could be solved  by this kind of uh
projects 
""
""
Right
""
""
""
""
""
What we have got to do is 
""
We should see uhm how  how many people uhm have really been
benefitted uhm
""
Why uhm  the scheme has been a failure
""
So after that 
and  improvement in the
 scope
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But the government does not
""
""
But as far as I think 
some hard steps 
""
But  uh people interfering in
it
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Uhm and 
they announce  uhn
""
""
And they never keep up  their words
""
""
Subsidies uh
""
""
Right
""
""
Yes you don't have to pay ten thousand  rupees
""
loan 
""
""
""
""
 political game
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
We become allured
""
""
Ha right
""
""
That is the  plight
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
And 
""
""
And the government does not
""
""
And once given 
tradition  what we think
""
""
Yes yes 
""
""
And that has been happening
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Uh alright uh now  since you are
an unemployed 
""
""
Every city  for
the  making the
best  use of the modern techniques of agriculture
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
The same traditional methods followed 
""
And it proved 
""
Every year some natural calamities  and this and that it
happens and  and we don't seem to
""
""
""
Well uh fortunately for you  Mr Mohan he is an
agriculturist  you can take suggestions
from him
""
""
Yes you are welcome
""
""
I no no
""
""
You can adopt
""
""
I see
""
""
The modern ways of agriculture 
""
And  say
 uhn Mr Lokesh is here to guide you how you
could  get loan uhm
""
He only will tell you  uh the proper way to approach the bank
""
""
""
""
""
I I think we have  uh uh subject
""
Infact our subject was unemployment
""
And I think this could be one of the solutions you know 
""
If uh these graduate people  can go back to
their lands and  uh adopt new techniques
""
""
""
""
""
Right
""
""
And try to contribute  our country in terms of
you know food 
""
Well I think  and uh
""
""
In fact it is a social service also
""
""
Right
""
""
And  people are under impression that white
collar jobs 
""
""
""
""
""
So shall we have a cup of tea 
""
I think 
""
""
Oh yes yes
""
""
Fine
""
""
""
""
""
No not yet  very hot that
""
""
I see
""
""
In fact when I was  I could notice
the difference in climate when  we are on the way
""
""
""
""
""

 I don't find she is really
""

 losing her popularities

But in the course of time  once uh I I I that could be
 told only
""
""
I see 
""
""
During the course of time 
""
""
Uh as we read
""
""
Because there is no 
oppose her 
""
""
Right  she has
almost become a dictator
""
""
""
""

In fact she  enjoys the popularity just because there is
no  opposition leader
""

Right
""
""
Who merits attention of the public
