Chairman sir  apparently
 with the duties set upto
four thousand five hundred twenty-two  capitals
and excise 
""
The Central Plan outlay have been increased by thirty-two percent
""
""
When we show all these things and expecting  one word
""
""
It seems to be 
""
But what is the real  we have to go
through little bit deeper
""
They are speaking thousand one hundred million man-days of the
employment 
""
But for nineteen ninety-two ninety-three  when we go through
the reality  we are able to create
only two hundred forty-three million man-days of employment  interruption
""
""
That means  what we envisage to create only twenty-five
percent of that  last
year last six months of the budget year 
""
I want to know from the government  what infrastructure has been
created to fulfill 
""
Sir  that for Central plan outlay has been
increased by thirty-two percent  go through with the
subsidy issue 
""
Sir according to subsidy  finance is assigned
 if I have gone to create
the I C O  the
fertiliser subsidy alone would have gone up to  eleven
thousand 
""
Because of the action taken in the last two years  the
fertiliser subsidy  three thousand
five hundred 
""
From this you can find out sir  more than seven thousand five
hundred 
shoulder already 
""
When we say that the subsidy keeps speaking that subsidy is
something  wrong policy
""
No  ?
""
Subsidy is nothing but the transfer of income from one section of
the society to another section of the society 
""
Suppose for example if I tell  if you want to stop the entire
subsidy for fertilizers  take up all the
concessions that what they are giving on the per tariff  the electricity
tariff 
""
Then 
then we may have to take 
States or European countries 
""
For example  what it pays about three hundred and fifty it is
approximately 
rupees  the same rate we
may have to import from the American farmers  as five hundred and fifty
""
""
Two hundred 
""
Instead of that what I say is instead of paying to the American
farmer 
""
What is wrong in giving subsidy  ?
""
Sir  that share of
the subsidies to the non-plan expenditure during the Seventh Plan period 
approximately this is sixteen percent 
""
Now  share of the subsidies in the non-plan
expenditure during this year  eight point seven percent
""
They think  they are
actually pleasing the 
""
This is not good for the common people in 
""
Sir regarding the interest payment  I want to tell sir the
interest payment  is now forty-two percent of the total non-plan
expenditure 
""
Now  it accounts forty-two percent of the total non-plan
expenditure 
""
But in the Seventh Plan average it was only twenty-seven percent
sir 
""
Then personal income tax exemption 
""
The income tax exemption till nineteen eighty-one  it was fifty
""
""
In nineteen eighty-five it was eighteen thousand  in nineteen
ninety it was twenty-two thousand  nineteen ninety-two twenty-eight
thousand 
""
Sir the nineteen eighty-one well what they say fifteen thousand
""
""
Now it is  rupees
""
""
What I wanted to emphasize through you sir  in Australia
different method is applied 
""
In Australia what they did Australia  according to
Australian 
that is their triparty  employers
employees  all together they have come to one conclusion and it is taken
as a base year 
""
From that base year  accepted exemption
amount  that every year what is actually inflation takes place in
Australia  the exempted limit
also keep being enhanced
""
Sir  emphasize to the
government of India  nineteen
eighty-one you please take it as a base year 
rupees 
""
After that every year how much deflation takes place in India 
so far taken in India 
after hopeless that inflation it enhance the amount then it will be one
scientific way
""
Sir regarding unique system of India  the investment is so far
 so far
""
But now 
""
Our honourable Finance Minister says  we have today equal
treatment with other financial institution we are 
""
But  they
have given the proper replace for that
""
Objectively  so as
to put the U T I or bond with other mutual fund
""
However  left
technical 
benefits to other mutual funds 
""
Instead of taking the benefits what people are enjoying in the U T
I 
""
Then sir 
""
""
 but the administrative
prices
""
For example I tell you 
pre-budget you can say pre-budget announcement
""
You have enhanced the price for sugar 
""
You have enhanced the price 
price increased 
""
The actual price increased  that the
prices of the coal  price of the
 then increased automatically it all the product put on the floor
therefore  that government should what
they they have shown  what they have said is
totally different from 
""
What is their real intention  ?
""
Therefore 
that please bring in practice  be the
government 
""
With these words I conclude
""
Thank you 
""
""
""
""
From the last two years  we successfully withdrew money from the
""
""
""
""
""
And thereby  crores
""
 rupees
 in the share
market 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore within last year  when we
proposed the budget  lot more
concessions were announced  than the capital
market 
""
""
Then we we  witnessed the goings
""
""
The hopes were raised  among many people including the rural
folk  lot more
money has been diverted from agriculture to manufacturing sector  and from
rural area to urban area 
""
I will also budget  there was
no hike in the  additional component was not
enhanced 
""
But at the same time  they gave certain relief to other sectors
""
""
And he said  but he
can't lend us 
""
Here they purposefully and calculatively transferred about thirty
thousand  from capital
account 
""
And so  then once money is transferred from capital account to
revenue account  and all your
 will be
affected 
""
And we are witnessing  that
every developmental activities is cancelled 
""
No construction of roads  no construction of bridges for
industry 
""
As the Finance Minister day-in and day-out  he talks much about
the so called liberalisation 
""
But this delicensing policy  is yet to touch the agricultural
sector 
""
And several  and several consumer goods
 one word
""
""
As far as exemption is concerned  than the so called delicensing
proposal  it is hardly that it is
changing the attitude 
""
For example you take the example of the 
""
Then all of our industries are related to  is
kept 
""
In Andra Pradesh  about ninety-two applications were received by
the government 
""
And the application was forwarded to the Union Government  to
the minister of sugar factories in Andhra Pradesh  with an install
capacity of twenty-five hundred metric tons per day  and with an
investment of  on each unit
""
""
And the larger units are allowed  crores
 as far as the
sugar-cane industry is concerned 
""
Then you take the example of the dairy industry 
""
When the government in their own  they have
given us into dairy industry also 
""
So  to go for
dairy industry 
""
Many people  like both domestic as well as the multinational
they came forward  as there is potential
in this country also 
""
But I was made to understand  he came
in the way 
""
""
So  announced through his animal husbundry
department of the ministry of  milk
and milk products are to the N F N F D O 
""
So  with an install
capacity of more than ten thousand litres per day  then entirely he has to
get his name registered  and we get registering form from the agriculture
department 
""
It is challenged in the court of law 
""
So for the last two years  instead of the liberalisation in the
dairy industry  applications are pending with the Union
government for want of the registration with delay  Ministry of
Agriculture headed by Mr Balram Jakhar 
""
I take another example 
""
For example  the R
K Reynolds Company  to
produce cigerettes in this country 
to the extent  that they would consume about twenty-eight thousand metric
tons of sugar 
""
And not only that  about one
forty  to the other countries
""
""
And they also ensured  crores
 they will contribute in the form of excise on this
cigerette 
""
But their proposal was was also 
""
I visited  and the
minister told me  as the deputy chairman of the planning
commission 
""
Since the last forty-five years  when
there is no hike 
""
But the answer to this  in
their own wisdom  they
enhanced the prices of the cigarette  then anticipating some enhancement
some hike in the excise components  on the cigarette in the budget
proposal 
""
But to their fortune  there was no increase in the excise
component 
""
Thereby 
to garner three hundred 
""
and  for in the form of the price of
the tobacco 
""
Add to this  are
going down when compared to the last two three years
""
So  to impose a levy of one
percent  which amount
""
""
And I hope  and the Finance
Minister will come out 
the Finance Bill  imposed on the
sale of the cigarette  and that money can be utilised as a market
stabilising fund
""
So  that the finance minister will come out with the
proposal  financing
 it
""
Thank you
