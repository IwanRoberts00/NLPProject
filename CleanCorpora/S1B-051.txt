Chairman sir  apparently
""
""
and excise 
""
The Central Plan outlay have been increased by thirty-two percent
""
""
When we show all these things and expecting  one word
""
""
""
""
But what is the real  we have to go
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
year last six months of the budget year 
""
""
created to fulfill 
""
Sir  that for Central plan outlay has been
""
""
""
""
""
the I C O  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
When we say that the subsidy keeps speaking that subsidy is
""
""
""
""
Subsidy is nothing but the transfer of income from one section of
""
""
Suppose for example if I tell  if you want to stop the entire
subsidy for fertilizers  take up all the
concessions that what they are giving on the per tariff  the electricity
tariff 
""
Then 
""
""
""
For example  what it pays about three hundred and fifty it is
""
rupees  the same rate we
may have to import from the American farmers  as five hundred and fifty
""
""
""
""
Instead of that what I say is instead of paying to the American
""
""
""
""
""
the subsidies to the non-plan expenditure during the Seventh Plan period 
""
""
Now  share of the subsidies in the non-plan
""
""
They think  they are
actually pleasing the 
""
This is not good for the common people in 
""
""
interest payment  is now forty-two percent of the total non-plan
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ninety it was twenty-two thousand  nineteen ninety-two twenty-eight
thousand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
Sir  emphasize to the
""
""
""
""
""
so far taken in India 
""
scientific way
""
Sir regarding unique system of India  the investment is so far
""
""
But now 
""
Our honourable Finance Minister says  we have today equal
""
""
""
have given the proper replace for that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Instead of taking the benefits what people are enjoying in the U T
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
therefore  that government should what
""
totally different from 
""
""
""
""
that please bring in practice  be the
""
""
With these words I conclude
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

The hopes were raised  among many people including the rural
""
""
rural area to urban area 
""
""
no hike in the  additional component was not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Here they purposefully and calculatively transferred about thirty
thousand  from capital
account 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
every developmental activities is cancelled 
""
""
""
""
""
the so called liberalisation 
""
But this delicensing policy  is yet to touch the agricultural
""
""
And several  and several consumer goods
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In Andra Pradesh  about ninety-two applications were received by
""
""
And the application was forwarded to the Union Government  to
""
capacity of twenty-five hundred metric tons per day  and with an
""
""
""
""
 as far as the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
they came forward  as there is potential
in this country also 
""
But I was made to understand  he came
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
dairy industry  applications are pending with the Union
""
""
""
I take another example 
""
""
K Reynolds Company  to
""
""
tons of sugar 
""
""
""
""
""
And they also ensured  crores
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
there is no hike 
""
""
their own wisdom  they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to garner three hundred 
""
and  for in the form of the price of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the Finance Bill  imposed on the
""
stabilising fund
""
So  that the finance minister will come out with the
""
 it
