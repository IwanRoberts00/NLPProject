Chairman sir when we go through the budget apparently
 it will exceed to just the budget with the duties set upto
four thousand five hundred twenty-two crores rupees capitals
and excise and no further taxes levied 
The Central Plan outlay have been increased by thirty-two percent
When we show all these things and expecting our one word
 be close by four point five percent 
It seems to be kept bold and imaginative budget 
But what is the real scenario of the budget we have to go
through little bit deeper
They are speaking thousand one hundred million man-days of the
employment that can be created what they feel 
But for nineteen ninety-two ninety-three when we go through
the reality the first six months where we are able to create
only two hundred forty-three million man-days of employment interruption
 outside 
That means now what we envisage to create only twenty-five
percent of that man-days we are able to create in the last last
year last six months of the budget year 
I want to know from the government what infrastructure has been
created to fulfill this year's target 
Sir while we say that for Central plan outlay has been
increased by thirty-two percent we must also go through with the
subsidy issue 
Sir according to subsidy whatever finance is assigned
 I want to quote financial resource if I have gone to create
the I C O if I have gone the same way as the last year the
fertiliser subsidy alone would have gone up to rupees eleven
thousand crores 
Because of the action taken in the last two years the
fertiliser subsidy could be only rupees three thousand
five hundred crores 
From this you can find out sir more than seven thousand five
hundred crores has been put on the farmer's 
shoulder already 
When we say that the subsidy keeps speaking that subsidy is
something wrong policy
No what is called subsidy ?
Subsidy is nothing but the transfer of income from one section of
the society to another section of the society 
Suppose for example if I tell if you want to stop the entire
subsidy for fertilizers and if you wanted to take up all the
concessions that what they are giving on the per tariff the electricity
tariff 
Then suppose the production of the agriculture comes down 
then we may have to take the grants from the foreign countries like 
States or European countries 
For example what it pays about three hundred and fifty it is
approximately I'm telling for three hundred and fifty 
rupees what it pays to our Indian farmer the same rate we
may have to import from the American farmers as five hundred and fifty
 rupees 
Two hundred rupees we have to pay more 
Instead of that what I say is instead of paying to the American
farmer why should not we give to our own Indian farmers 
What is wrong in giving subsidy ?
Sir regarding the subsidies I wanted to tell that share of
the subsidies to the non-plan expenditure during the Seventh Plan period 
approximately this is sixteen percent 
Now this side share of the subsidies in the non-plan
expenditure during this year it is reduced eight point seven percent
They think that subsequent reduce in the subsidy they are
actually pleasing the one word a body of the world bank 
This is not good for the common people in the India 
Sir regarding the interest payment I want to tell sir the
interest payment is now forty-two percent of the total non-plan
expenditure 
Now it accounts forty-two percent of the total non-plan
expenditure 
But in the Seventh Plan average it was only twenty-seven percent
sir 
Then personal income tax exemption 
The income tax exemption till nineteen eighty-one it was fifty
 rupees fifteen thousand 
In nineteen eighty-five it was eighteen thousand in nineteen
ninety it was twenty-two thousand nineteen ninety-two twenty-eight
thousand 
Sir the nineteen eighty-one well what they say fifteen thousand
 rupees exemption into that system sir 
Now it is the value of that fifteen thousand rupees
 now it is said about forty thousand rupees 
What I wanted to emphasize through you sir in Australia
different method is applied 
In Australia what they did Australia one word according to
Australian one word first they fixed the base or base amount 
that is their triparty two words that government employers
employees all together they have come to one conclusion and it is taken
as a base year 
From that base year when one's accepted exemption
amount that every year what is actually inflation takes place in
Australia they have according to that percentage the exempted limit
also keep being enhanced
Sir through you what I wanted to emphasize to the
government of India that please atleast now you replace that nineteen
eighty-one you please take it as a base year fifteen thousand 
rupees 
After that every year how much deflation takes place in India 
so far taken in India you please translate it that this inflation 
after hopeless that inflation it enhance the amount then it will be one
scientific way
Sir regarding unique system of India the investment is so far
 it attracts the eight to eighty of one word so far
But now it has been given up 
Our honourable Finance Minister says we have today equal
treatment with other financial institution we are dealing 
But for this one gentlemen what the economy they
have given the proper replace for that
Objectively the Finance Minister has taken this step so as
to put the U T I or bond with other mutual fund
However if that was the only reason surely his left
technical method would have been the extensive a few words 
benefits to other mutual funds 
Instead of taking the benefits what people are enjoying in the U T
I they would have experienced the same benefit the other mutual funds 
Then sir when you object actually enhance the prices 
 You're doing not only the interest one word 
 not only in the tax one word but the administrative
prices
For example I tell you before announcing the budget 
pre-budget you can say pre-budget announcement
You have enhanced the price for sugar 
You have enhanced the price for actually the rice's 
price increased 
The actual price increased gold price increased that the
prices of the coal prices of the sugar price of rice price of the
 then increased automatically it all the product put on the floor
therefore what I request the government that government should what
they they have shown what they have printed what they have said is
totally different from what they are doing 
What is their real intention ?
Therefore I wanted to I want I request you truly sir 
that please bring in practice that the one word be the
government 
With these words I conclude
Thank you 
 One or two words 
From the last two years we successfully withdrew money from the
 one word 
 A few words 
And thereby about thirty-two thousand crores
 of rupees has been withdrawn from the market 
 and thirty-two thousand crores of rupees
 has been invested in the financial market in the share
market 
 A few words 
 A few words 
Therefore within last year Shivaji when we
proposed the budget and uh due to the a few words lot more
concessions were announced for the industrial set-up than the capital
market Shivaji 
Then we we then the entire nation witnessed the goings
 in regards to the scam scandal 
The hopes were raised among many people including the rural
folk to invest in the industrial sector and thereby lot more
money has been diverted from agriculture to manufacturing sector and from
rural area to urban area 
I will also budget when we budget at the budget there was
no hike in the tax component and uh additional component was not
enhanced nor the custom duties 
But at the same time they gave certain relief to other sectors
And he said that everything is going to be cosy but he
can't lend us we analyse the figures 
Here they purposefully and calculatively transferred about thirty
thousand crores of rupees from capital
account to revenue account 
And so then once money is transferred from capital account to
revenue account all your balance expenditure will be cut and all your
 development developmental activities will be
affected 
And we are witnessing in this in this country that
every developmental activities is cancelled 
No construction of roads no construction of bridges for
industry and no allocation or any land allocation in this country 
As the Finance Minister day-in and day-out he talks much about
the so called liberalisation and the so called delicensing policy 
But this delicensing policy is yet to touch the agricultural
sector 
And several manufactured goods and several consumer goods
 includes the motor cars refrigerators as well as the one word
 and washing machines are under the delicensing policy 
As far as exemption is concerned than the so called delicensing
proposal and so called liberalisation it is hardly that it is
changing the attitude a few words in the agriculture sector 
For example you take the example of the sugar industry 
Then all of our industries are related to sugar industry is
kept with the ministry of industry 
In Andra Pradesh about ninety-two applications were received by
the government 
And the application was forwarded to the Union Government to
the minister of sugar factories in Andhra Pradesh with an install
capacity of twenty-five hundred metric tons per day and with an
investment of not less than forty crores on each unit
And the larger units are allowed four thousand crores
 of investment has been pumped into circulation as far as the
sugar-cane industry is concerned 
Then you take the example of the dairy industry 
When the government in their own one word they have
given us into dairy industry also 
So there are about six fifty people applied for to go for
dairy industry 
Many people like both domestic as well as the multinational
they came forward to go for the dairy industry as there is potential
in this country also 
But I was made to understand that Mr Balram Jakhar he came
in the way and he wanted to bring same other Narad 
 through back door 
So Mr Balram Jakhar announced through his animal husbundry
department of the ministry of agriculture an offer by then milk
and milk products are to the N F N F D O 
So if anybody wants to go for dairy with an install
capacity of more than ten thousand litres per day then entirely he has to
get his name registered and we get registering form from the agriculture
department 
It is challenged in the court of law 
So for the last two years instead of the liberalisation in the
dairy industry two words applications are pending with the Union
government for want of the registration with delay Ministry of
Agriculture headed by Mr Balram Jakhar 
I take another example 
For example the second biggest monopoly in the world the R
K Reynolds Company they approached this government to allow them to
produce cigerettes in this country and they ensured the nation to 
to the extent that they would consume about twenty-eight thousand metric
tons of sugar metric tons of tobacco in this country 
And not only that they ensured to export about one
forty crores of cigarettes to the other countries
And they also ensured that about six hundred crores
 of revenue they will contribute in the form of excise on this
cigerette 
But their proposal was was also turned down 
I visited one word to the minister of Commerce and the
minister told me that as the deputy chairman of the planning
commission he vetoed it 
Since the last forty-five years this is the only year when
there is no hike and the excise component on the Cigarette 
But the answer to this the cigarette manufacturers in
their own wisdom during last January February as they rotate they
enhanced the prices of the cigarette then anticipating some enhancement
some hike in the excise components on the cigarette in the budget
proposal 
But to their fortune there was no increase in the excise
component 
Thereby the cigarette manufacturers drawn an opportunity 
to garner three hundred crores of rupees 
 which did not circulate to the government in the form of the revenue 
and nor to the tobacco grower for in the form of the price of
the tobacco 
Add to this two words the prices of the tobacco are
going down when compared to the last two three years
So we suggested to the government to impose a levy of one
percent on the sale of the cigarette and which money which amount
 can be utilised as a market stabilising fund for the tobacco 
And I hope the government will come out and the Finance
Minister will come out while answering these by answering 
the Finance Bill and see that the one percent is imposed on the
sale of the cigarette and that money can be utilised as a market
stabilising fund
So I hope that the finance minister will come out with the
proposal while answering these fi financing
 it
Thank you
