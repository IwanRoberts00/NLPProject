<I>
Ah uhm uh thank you very much uh professor Kohli 
spoke so nice words about me uh I don't know how much I deserve
them 
Uhm professor Kohli requested me to talk on 
National income uh accounts 
Uhm my purpose here was to make things very simple 
Uh maybe what my idea was this is a most of you are
teachers and you know in a class when you go to a class 
there are bright students there are mediocres there are bit
dull students also 
So teacher has a big problem of uh satisfying all the 
students 
So now comes the question what level he should go 
It should benefit most of them
So one has to be bit uh see that everybody follows 
Uh now we have that gathering I see most of you have put in
some more than a decade of service 
And most of you are uhm good good having good
experience in teaching uhn 
What I want to do here is only thing is some of you may not be
having uh background about National income accounts 
and other things 
Uh with that intention I want to give some idea about what
 National income accounts is ?
How it is useful ?
And how it is computed ?
And then in the second lecture I would give try to
give you uhn the backgr the trends in India 
 Indian economy 
What is the per capita income of a India ?
This thing and how it is computed ?
What are its weaknesses this is for todays programme 
Uhm as I told in beginning this is li I would like to make
it as simple as possible without ma uh this thing 
 I my main idea is that everybody should get
something uh that is the thing they should feel it okay 
Others who are more interest in deeper questions can
approach me again uh your all all the time you are welcome and
 it's a great pleasure to have interaction with you 
Now uh if I ask anybody What is in
 income ?
 What is your income ?
You may say some six thousand seven thousand or ten thousand
 things 
But it it looks to be very simple question 
But if we go deeper it is not as simple as you think at
the first time 
Uhm take uh this income somebody mainly we who are
salaried person by income we meant whatever salary we are getting
that monthly that is the salary
Or at the best you say okay whatever our take home salary is there
 after deductions 
Okay we are having ten thousand salary or some two thousand is
deducted eight thousand is our take home salary 
This we take it as a income 
This but if we go deeper this is not the only total
income 
For example some of us may have some own house 
In that way we also get a a rent imputed rent 
So our income consist not only of salary but also the rent of
the house in which we are living because if we go for some other rented
house we had to pay that rent for that house 
Now because it is our own house we are not paying so 
indirectly it means that we are getting that much income
We are not uh paying cash but because we are utilising
that uh services of that residence resident it also means 
it is uh rent 
We are getting rent in this thing 
Our income also should include salary beside salary it
should include the rent 
Some of us may have put some fixed deposit in the bank 
F D 
So annually we may get some interest 
That also is a part of the our income 
That thing interest that we get on our fixed deposit or saving
accounts in our bank 
 My maybe it may be small amount but uh for uh 
conceptual purpose it should be included
Maybe we may if we take in our bank account uh may be
interest we may be getting hardly per annum some fifteen twenty
 rupees or hundred rupees per annum
because our savings may not be much
But it is also a part of our income that interest that we get
Then we may have bought some shares or dividends 
Uh this is mostly the salaried persons buy the shares and this
things 
The dividends that we get on that uh shares also a
part of our income 
Next component we may think we may have some people may have
agriculture land they at their own native place 
From agriculture they will be getting some either they may
have leased out the land to some tenant and getting rent on it that
is a rent from the land 
Or they may be having share cropping they may contribute
something to the cultivation and for uh tenants cultivates and they
get share cropping will be there 
This also forms a part of our income 
So uh in the beginning when you thought what is income 
you took it as salary income means only salary for salaried
persons
But actually if we go deeper it includes many other components
 which we generally uh don't take care of notice it 
That it actually income is such a broad concept 
When income is a for of a individual is so 
difficult to compute or even assess uh what about the 
country's income 
 Country's income means income of all the people in the
country 
 It's all the more difficult 
What we mean by natio income of the nation or national
income ?
The national income means the value of the output which is
 produced in the country the final goods value of the final
goods produced in the country is taken as national income
Now here I use the concept final goods 
Why we should use final goods ?
Because if we don't take account of this we'll 
have some problems called double counting 
Suppose wa if you want to if you don't 
take care of this there is a problem of double counting 
Suppose you take the case of uh a simple example which is
given is about the bread industry 
So if you take the what all the total value of the bread produced
in the country 
Total value of the wheat produced in the country 
Total value of the fertiliser produced in the country 
There will be double counting or treble counting how ?
When you take the value of the bread that value of the bread
also consist contains the value of the wheat used in the 
making of bread 
So uh the and when you take the value of the
total wheat again you are counting that portion of wheat which has gone
into the making of bread also 
Whatever that all wheat produced in the country will not go to
making bread but atleast some wheat is goes in making of bread
So the wheat is counted twice 
Wheat is counted when you are taking the total value of bread 
wheat is also counted when you are taking the total value of wheat
And also think of fertiliser which is used in making of 
this bread uh wheat 
 Producing uh for producing wheat we make use of
fertiliser 
The value of the fertiliser is contained in the value of wheat 
again it is also contained in the value of uh bread 
So if you don't take care of only uh final goods 
we'll be commiting this uh mistake of counting the same
items more than once 
So we should try to avoid this 
Now comes the question how to know which is final good
 which is not the final good 
So is bread the final good or is wheat the final good 
is fertiliser final good 
So because there is a difficulty in distinguishing which
is final good and which is intermediary good we have another to
overcome this problem we have a method called value added method 
In that means uh in each industry how much value is added
 by each industry 
That we take into account not the total value of the output of
 bread industry 
 We'll only take the how much bread industry has
 added the value to the product 
So baking bread baking so they have pro sold
the bread at ten rupees and uh they have bought the
input of say eight rupees worth of inputs for
buying wheat and other things they have paper and packing other things 
They have brought uh purchased the bread industry has purchased
eight rupees worth of inputs and they have sold the
bread for ten rupees 
So now they how much value they have added to this
bread they have added the value of ten two rupees 
because eight rupees was the value of inputs which they have
purchased ei ten rupees they have sold 
So that to bread uh that final product which we 
suppose we take it bread for that bread they have added uh uhm 
value of two rupees 
This is how we uh take it as uh value added 
So one has to be while computing national income one
has to be careful in avoiding this double counting or counting the same
item more than once 
Then another thing we have to notice is this national income is in
only money terms because we are hetregenous items are
produced 
Iron is produced uh foodgrain is produced so many items are
produced 
So it is a it is expressed only in money terms 
Agriculture output could have been produced in uh mentioned in
physical terms whereas national income has to be expressed in money
terms
This is another important thing to be noted 
So we require some prices 
What prices should we use is another difficult question uh to
answer 
Then we have to notice that it is a flow concept 
Flow means how much output produced during a particular year
or a particular month 
Instead what is the value of uh income means income
per month or income per annum like that
So flow means the period time period is important 
 It is a national income is a flow concept that means
how much value has been produced from January first nineteen ninety-six to
 December thirty-first nineteen ninety-six 
In this aca calendar year how much is produced
So it is a flow concept 
Uh these are the some of the important things to be noticed
about a national income 
Now what is the use of national income if it consist 
outside if uh ask this question at which national income is 
used as a economic barometre 
Like what is the condition of the economy to know the
condition of the economy 
Like a doctor if you go to a doctor before you
ask any question he will put his thermometre into your mouth 
And he wants to know the temperature uh things
So a economist also if he wants to know the condition of
any economy he says what is per national income of the country 
So that means some uh weaknesses in this national income
 but it broadly indicates the health of the economy how good how
 sound is the health of the economy 
So this is necessary national income is necessary to know
 health of the economy 
And also we can compare two economies which economy is
stronger economically 
For intercountry comparison is also it is useful 
So how so America is rich you know how much in a 
what is the per capita income in India what is the per capita in America
Say twenty times it is more than in India 
Or thirty times more than in India 
So that shows how rich they are 
So for in relative comparison also this uh 
national income is useful 
Then within the country also we have so many different states
And we want to compare uh which state is better which is
doing well 
So which is richer state uh like that
So interstate comparison also to make interstate
comparison also this uh na state income uh estimates
are being made these days 
Then we know over a period of time how country is
growing 
To assess the performence of an economy also this pe
 national income data is very useful 
Then you can also see uh that uh in the economy there
are different sectors like household sector we have 
We have corporate sector we have government sector 
What is the interaction of these sectors that is how much 
how much is government sector is taking away from the household
sector how much government in the form of tax how much government
sector is taking away from the corporate sector in the form of tax
