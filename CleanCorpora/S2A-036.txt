And then  try to
""

""
""
""
""
it as simple as possible without 
""
 everybody should get
something uh 
""
""
approach me again uh  all the time you are welcome and
""
""
Now  in
""
""
""
""
You may say some  six thousand seven thousand or ten thousand
""
""
But it 
""
""
the first time 
""
Uhm  mainly we who are
salaried person  whatever salary we are getting
""
""
""
""
""
Okay we are having ten thousand salary or some two thousand is
""
""
This we take it as a income 
""
""
income 
""
""
""
""
""
So our income consist not only of salary but also the rent  of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Some of us may have 
F D 
""
So annually we may get some interest 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
because our  savings may not be much
""
""
""
""

agriculture land 
""
From agriculture they will be getting some  either they may
""
is a 
""
""
something to the  and for uh tenants cultivates and they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
difficult to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
income  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why we should use final goods  ?
""
Because 
""
""
Suppose 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Total 
""
""
""
""
""
making of bread 
""
""
""
""
""
Whatever that  all wheat produced in the country will not go to
making bread but atleast some wheat  goes in making of bread
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And also 
""
""
 we make use of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
items 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is fertiliser 
""
So  which
is final good and which is intermediary good  to
""
""
""
""
""
That we take into account not the total value of the output  of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
input of  for
""
""
""
eight  and they have sold the
bread for ten 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
So  one
""
item 
""
""
only money terms  hetregenous items are
""
""
Iron is produced  uh foodgrain is produced so many items are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
or a particular month 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Like  before you
""
""
And  uh things
""
So  if he wants to know the condition of
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
stronger 
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
national income is 
""
Then within the country also  we have so many different states
""
""
