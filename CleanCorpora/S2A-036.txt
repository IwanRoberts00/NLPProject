Ah uhm 
spoke  I don't know how much I deserve
them 
""
Uhm 
National income uh accounts 
""
Uhm 
""
Uh maybe  most of you are
teachers 
there are bright students  there are bit
dull students also 
""
So teacher has a big problem 
students 
""
So now comes the question 
""
It should benefit most of them
""
So one has to be 
""
Uh now we have  most of you have put in
some more than a decade of service 
""
And most of you are  having good
experience in teaching 
""
What I want to do here is  only thing is some of you may not be
having 
and other things 
""
Uh with that intention I want to  what
 ?
""
How it is useful  ?
""
And how it is computed  ?
""
And then  try to
give you 
""
""
What is the per capita income of  ?
""
This thing  ?
""
What are its weaknesses 
""
Uhm as I told in beginning this is  I would like to make
it as simple as possible without 
""
 everybody should get
something uh 
""
Others who are  can
approach me again uh  all the time you are welcome and
""
""
Now  in
 ?
""
 ?
""
You may say some  six thousand seven thousand or ten thousand
""
""
But it 
""
But if we go deeper  at
the first time 
""
Uhm  mainly we who are
salaried person  whatever salary we are getting
that monthly  that is the salary
""
Or at the best you say okay whatever our take home salary is there
""
""
Okay we are having ten thousand salary or some two thousand is
deducted 
""
This we take it as a income 
""
This  total
income 
""
For example some of us may have some 
""
In that way we also get a 
""
So our income consist not only of salary but also the rent  of
the house in which we are living because if we  go for some other rented
house we had to pay that rent 
""
Now because it is our own house we are not paying 
indirectly it means that we are getting that much income
""
We are not  but because we are utilising
that uh services of that residence 
it is uh rent 
""
We are getting rent in 
""
Our income also should include  it
should include the rent 
""
Some of us may have 
F D 
""
So annually we may get some interest 
""
That also is a part of 
""
That thing interest that we get on our fixed deposit or  saving
accounts in our bank 
""
""
conceptual purpose it should be  included
""
Maybe we may  may be
interest we may  getting hardly per annum some fifteen twenty
 per annum
because our  savings may not be much
""
But it is also a part of our income  that interest that we get
""
""
Then we may have bought some shares 
""
Uh this is mostly the salaried persons  buy the shares and this
things 
""
The dividends that we get  a
part of our 
""
Next component we may think  we may have some people may have
agriculture land 
""
From agriculture they will be getting some  either they may
have leased out  that
is a 
""
Or they may be having share cropping  they may contribute
something to the  and for uh tenants cultivates and they
get 
""
This also 
""
So 
you  for salaried
persons
""
But actually if we go deeper  it includes many other components
""
""
That it actually 
""
When 
difficult to 
country's 
""
 income means income of all the people in the
country 
""
""
""
What we mean by  income of the nation or national
income  ?
""
The national income means the value of the output  which is
 value of the final
goods  taken as national income
""
""
Now here I use the concept final goods 
""
Why we should use final goods  ?
""
Because 
have some problems called double counting 
""
Suppose 
take care of this 
""
Suppose you take the case of  uh a simple example which is
given 
""
So if you take the what all the total value of the bread produced
in the country 
""
Total value of the wheat produced in the country 
""
Total 
""
There will be double counting  ?
""
When you take the value of the bread  that value of the bread
also 
making of bread 
""
So  when you take the value of the
total wheat  again you are counting that portion of wheat which has gone
into the making of bread also 
""
Whatever that  all wheat produced in the country will not go to
making bread but atleast some wheat  goes in making of bread
""
""
So 
""
Wheat is counted when you are taking the total value of bread 
wheat is also counted when  taking the total value of wheat
""
""
And also 
this bread uh wheat 
""
 we make use of
fertiliser 
""
The value of the fertiliser is contained in the value of wheat 
again it is also contained in the value of 
""
So 
we'll  the same
items 
""
So we should try to avoid this 
""
Now  how to know which is final good
""
""
So 
is fertiliser 
""
So  which
is final good and which is intermediary good  to
overcome this problem we have a method called 
""
In that means  in each industry how much value is added
""
""
That we take into account not the total value of the output  of
""
""
 bread industry has
""
""
So baking  sold
the bread at ten  and uh they have bought the
input of  for
buying wheat and other things they have paper and packing other things 
""
They have brought  uh purchased the bread industry has purchased
eight  and they have sold the
bread for ten 
""
So  how much value they have added to this
bread 
because eight  was the value of inputs which they have
purchased 
""
So 
suppose we take it bread 
value of two 
""
This is how we 
""
So  one
has to be careful  in avoiding this double counting or counting the same
item 
""
Then another thing we have to notice is this national income is in
only money terms  hetregenous items are
produced 
""
Iron is produced  uh foodgrain is produced so many items are
produced 
""
So 
""
Agriculture output could have been produced in  uh mentioned in
physical terms  money
terms
""
This is another important 
""
So we require some prices 
""
What prices should we use is another difficult question  uh to
answer 
""
Then 
""
Flow means  how much output produced during a particular year
or a particular month 
""
Instead  income
per month or income per annum  like that
""
So flow means the period time period is important 
""
 is a flow concept that means
how much value has been produced from January first nineteen ninety-six to
""
""
In this  is produced
""
So it is a flow concept 
""
Uh these are the  some of the important things to be noticed
about 
""
Now 
outside 
used as a economic barometre 
""
Like what is the condition of the economy  to know the
condition of the economy 
""
Like  before you
ask any question he will put his thermometre into your mouth 
""
And  uh things
""
So  if he wants to know the condition of
any economy he says what is 
""
So  weaknesses in this national income
 how good how
""
""
So  national income is necessary to know
""
""
And also we can compare  which economy is
stronger 
""
For intercountry comparison is also it is useful 
""
So how 
what is the per capita income in India what is the per capita in  America
""
Say twenty times it is more than in India 
""
Or thirty times more than in India 
""
So that shows how rich they are 
""
So for 
national income is 
""
Then within the country also  we have so many different states
""
""
And we want to compare  which is
doing well 
""
So which is richer state  like that
""
So  to make interstate
comparison also  uh estimates
are being made these days 
""
Then  how country is
growing 
""
To assess  pe
""
""
Then you can also see  in the economy there
are different sectors 
""
We have 
""
What is the interaction of these sectors 
how much  government sector is taking away from the household
sector  how much government
sector is taking away from the corporate sector
