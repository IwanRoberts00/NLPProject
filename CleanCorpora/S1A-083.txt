<I>
""
""
Well  little
""
""
""
""
What was the main reason for that  ?
""
""
No  reason at
all 
""
Hardly ever comes to the mess and all 
""
""
Or do the students demand something  ?
""
""
No no no no we  got I think all things that we
need 
""
But so far the warden has never been 
""
He hardly ever comes to the mess  supposed to look
after the food and all 
""
He doesn't come  at all
""
""
""
""
""
Just he atleast food about the 
""
""
 except his
 telephone and all those things
""
""
""
""
""
But 
to show him how  by some other means
""
""
No we tried to convince him but unfortunately  he's
""
""
""
Uhn but I think that this is the usual problem in almost all
the hostels of  that the authorities when they get
""
organisation 
""
""
""
""
""
So in all the cases these the students feel that the
authorities are doing nothing then the  one
word 
""
""
 are justified and what I am
saying  which
directly affects to the students  why these people are very
much 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 thing
is that the managing body and other things they are supporting
""
""
""
""
""
How about the other 
""
""
""
They are okay 
""
""
Okay and uh
""
""
They are okay means in the sense that they didn't create any
problems
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
The warden as a matter of fact never created any problem but
""
""
As a matter of fact 
don't have any authorities at all  ah ha
 I think that
""
""
""
""
""
What about your R T  ?
""
""
 okay
""
""
He is doing his post uh 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Was the concept of R T as the  post
""
""
No concept at all  I don't know about any concept
""
Why don't you 
especially in our hostel 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Or we don't just care about that authorities  we do
whatever we want
""
""
Oh 
""
""
I thought you just say yes and  sign of the
""
""
""
""
every hostel is like an institution 
they've 
""
""
""
""
""
The question is may be  that was the basic
answer
""
But our hostel I don't think has 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And if you say for that matter my hostel is fortunate in 
fortunate enough to get uh  like you see we have
""
""
Ah your hostel has got a lot of problems for example 
it is 
for whose 
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 are there problems are there what
 who does
care about the study of the students
""
""
Study of the students
""
""
Yeah 
ge 
 one word
""
""
""
I don't know 
""
Our R T just comes  shakes hand with
all the boys  we
talk about all the  topic except the hostel topics
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And 
""
""
So  just their
target was to get uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
They are not interested at all in this welfare of the students 
""
Why should a person care ?
""
Why should he throw his family means he don't care about his family
rather than  come and start looking after
boys 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah and uh  what manner you people are approaching to the
higher authorities ?
""
""
No  give
the  they refused so we are planning to go on a
hunger strike 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Fast unto death 
""
""
When  ?
""
""
It was supposed to start from today but the managing committee
has asked  one
word 
""
""
""
""
""
 its good to uh
 one word
 of other
""
""
Well the other hostelers can't do anything about their own
hostel so why  anything about our hostel
""
""
 just inform that these
people
""
""
No that was therefore  my
hostel is far far better from the other hostel 
""
""
Uh ah
""
""
Atleast jubilee there used to be a time when jubilee was like
that but 
""
Now police enters jubilee without much you know but in our case 
it's  impossible for the police man to enter
""
""
But I think  in
jubilee case they  one
word 
some sort of uh statement in papers 
""
""
""
""
""
Well in favour of the students first of all there is one thing
""
""
We must easily understand that whatever was happening in jubilee
was wrong 
""
That there are boys who were staying there for six seven years and
they have never been enroll in any 
""
It was a matter of fact that 
""
""
 do you think that this is the fault
of the students only ?
""
""
This is the fault of students only 
the students themselves
""
""
""
""
""
Authorities I suppose
""
""
No no no 
they can't do anything  they will just keep quite
""
There are two types of students  cool type
""
 just go on with the studies and doesn't bother about
what  exactly is going around
""
Other type is that type  just interact with those
very hoodlums 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Just to be on the safe side
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
Now this is two types
""
The cool type will never do anything
""
And the hoodlums just doesn't keep quite
""
""
But this
""
""
At that time I think it is the duty of the authorities to
just have the matter straight 
""
 heard that jubilee people even most of the jubilee
people 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Particularly lot of uh  who were
arrested in mid-terms 
""
""
 the
""
""
 important
""
""
No
""
""
But it never went to that
""
""
Created in the paper
""
""
No no no 
because we realise 
mean they just seem to stay without
""
""
Just listen this really is one very important thing
""
That any  university especially in post-graduate
courses 
and so you see in hostel  you
""
""
""
""
""
There is a clearcut 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 some problem in
enrollment 
""
""
This is its only for those people who don't have much say 
who can't shout  only for those
""
Rules are there but they apply only to people who are
""
""
How could people were living from six or seven years and
nobody went and asked 
""
""
""
""
""
""
That does us  they
seem to take out a knife 
""
""
 even authorities what
 saying that the authorities were were the main responsible
persons you see 
""
That they did not take care of the hostel and after that when
somebody is dropped there and it is there 
""
""
No
""
""
Some personal interest 
""
""
The authorities in the beginning for example take your 
this Pundit was there 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
See what he  used to do he used to interact with
those very people 
""
And if he wanted to get 
going down in a very bad way 
""
He used to meet them and he used to manage that
""
""
""
""
""
No he was a
""
""
But he didn't get  in it
""
He doesn't want their help because  heard that he
himself claim to be a 
goonda 
""
""
Yeah yeah  saying
""
""
No he is not afraid of those people 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
But the Pundit he  he used to
do it
""
""
No he
""
""
He used to take the help of those
""
""
He  he never he never did take help
""
""
 heard there was one chap in uh
 uh this
guy  he has helped me he has given the hostel to
this person who didn't have any right to the hostel he gave 
to this person because of my 
""
""
Uhn
""
""
But the thing is in our case  it if its
okay  in that case the authorities is itelf responsible unless authorities
""
""
""
No but you see
""
""
And students were supported
""
""
Students or you see a  a
very gentleman
""
""
""
""
""
No no  in my hostel there are about
 you can say
clearcut 
""
And there are other one eighty guys one seventy guys you can say
who are this cool type
""
Okay this ten people will go  fifty people will be watching
their particular programme on T V 
""
And uh these ten people will go  do all of
a sudden  come without saying anything they will simply turn
the channel 
""
""
 thus agree it was the authorities
were 
""
""
""
""
""
What happened is they will change programme and the fifty
guys 
""
 not the fault of those ten guys it is the fault of
fifty guys who just keep quite 
""
Why do they keep quite  ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Okay if I want to watch  that is
not my 
otherwise I can't watch it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah no doubt 
""
""
There are two things only  either you join those people
""
""
""
No there are
""
""
And one thing about those people is when they realise that
somebody is capable of fighting them back  they will just join him they
will just keep him in  means they have very good term with him
""
""
All the  which is temporary you know
controversial matter 
""
""
No no no
""
""
But after all
""
""
I don't think  a controversial
""
""
What do you think about your department infact uh  about
your study and the way they teach  ?
""
""
Well fine 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Do you think that there should be something else which should
be included 
""
""
No I don't think 
""
I think 
""
""
It should be
""
""
No no department okay 
""
The teachers are okay 
""
""
And they give proper
""
""
Only thing is that uh  large
""
""
""
Avenue should be
""
""
Job avenues and all
""
""
Facilities
""
""
There is no job avenue  facilities are also okay I think
""
""
No no facilities to students and those  who get get the
degree
""
""
Yeah
""
""
They didn't have an opportunity
""
""
There don't have any opportunity
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Almost zero 
""
""
 just
adding 
""
""
""
""
A zero
""
""
""
""
Ah don't you think that the the teachers should continue this
department uh during late evening too  ?
""
That the students come
""
""
No it is difference difference in the students  I don't
think students 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I think just  I have been here now for I
think three and half years and I feel 
""
It depends on the students if you want to carry on studies you can
just go to lab and study whatsoever you like  and if you feel the need of
""
""
They all think that we cannot study but they if they want to
 consult
""
""
He can he can consult  I don't think there is any problem
so far  never faced any problem
""
Whenever I feel somehow  gone to any Professor
and he has been very glad to help me 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I feel so
