<I>
Well the they represent not so expert little
 warden and uh they're planning to one word 
 as a one word of 
What was the main reason for that ?
No particularly particular reason at
all just and we feel that he is not caring about his job 
Hardly ever comes to the mess and all 
Or do the students demand something ?
No no no no we we've got I think all things that we
need 
But so far the warden has never been quite good in his job 
He hardly ever comes to the mess he's supposed to look
after the food and all 
He doesn't come to the mess at all
 Ah ha ha 
Just he atleast food about the 
 He's least bothered about anything except his
 uh residence and telephone and all those things
 One word 
But don't you find any other way to convince him that 
to show him how by some other means
No we tried to convince him but unfortunately he's
 beyond convincing 
Uhn but I think that this is the usual problem in almost all
the hostels of D U uh that the authorities when they get
 uhm residence didn't pay attention on hostel its 
organisation this is the usual problem 
 Uh 
So in all the cases these the students feel that the
authorities are doing nothing then the authorities should be one
word 
 Yeah yeah you people are justified and what I am
saying uh that maybe that uh are something which uh which
directly affects to the students that's why these people are very
much one word 
Uhn 
Yeah 
 That's it uh and the thing
is that the managing body and other things they are supporting
 Uh 
How about the other one word part one word 
They are okay 
Okay and uh
They are okay means in the sense that they didn't create any
problems
Ah ha 
The warden as a matter of fact never created any problem but
 he was useless laughs 
As a matter of fact if we if we if we 
don't have any authorities at all we're better off ah ha
 I think that
 Ah ha 
What about your R T ?
 He's okay okay
He is doing his post uh 
Yeah well whatever we tell him to do he does 
Was the concept of R T as the one word post
No concept at all I don't know about any concept
Why don't you two words any authority in the hostel 
especially in our hostel 
Yeah 
Or we don't just care about that authorities we do
whatever we want
Oh 
I thought you just say yes and one word sign of the
 one word 
 I came to know that in one word 
every hostel is like an institution and so that's why 
they've appointed one R T uhm with other trainee 
 Uhm 
The question is may be uh that was the basic
answer
But our hostel I don't think has is an exception as 
 Yeah 
 It's an exception 
Yeah 
And if you say for that matter my hostel is fortunate in 
fortunate enough to get uh R T uhm like you see we have
Ah your hostel has got a lot of problems for example 
it is two words rowdy and all then the new 
for whose one word he started kicking off the students without 
uh one word 
 These problem are there 
 Yeah yeah 
 Problems are there problems are there what
 I'm saying is that uh we've got an R T who does
care about the study of the students
Study of the students
Yeah because if suppose you have got some problem in 
ge getting your things done then he will come and ask 
 okay if you have any problem just say don't hesitate and one word
 
I don't know no our R T doesn't do that 
Our R T just comes once in a while shakes hand with
all the boys then we start talking to him and he talks back we
talk about all the to topic except the hostel topics
 Still you people are one word 
Yeah 
And anything that's just 
So yeah what do you think that just their
target was to get uh get the two words 
 Yeah 
Yeah yeah that's the main thing 
They are not interested at all in this welfare of the students 
Why should a person care ?
Why should he throw his family means he don't care about his family
rather than yeah he'll come and start looking after
boys who know very little 
 Yeah 
Yeah and uh what manner you people are approaching to the
higher authorities ?
No we've the higher authorities to just uh give
the warden's notice they refused so we are planning to go on a
hunger strike 
Yeah
Fast unto death 
When you'll start ?
It was supposed to start from today but the managing committee
has asked yes that give some more time to one
word 
 Yes 
 But don't you think that uh its good to uh
 in to inform other hostelers also means some hostel one word
 of other
Well the other hostelers can't do anything about their own
hostel so why should they do anything about our hostel
 You you should just just inform that these
people
No that was therefore I'll tell you one thing my
hostel is far far better from the other hostel 
Uh ah
Atleast jubilee there used to be a time when jubilee was like
that but jubilee couldn't two words 
Now police enters jubilee without much you know but in our case 
it's impossible for the police man to enter
But I think that uh there were people in
jubilee case they they attracted with the hostel itself uh one
word also and one word and they two have given some 
some sort of uh statement in papers regarding the students 
 Uhn 
Well in favour of the students first of all there is one thing
We must easily understand that whatever was happening in jubilee
was wrong 
That there are boys who were staying there for six seven years and
they have never been enroll in any uh department 
It was a matter of fact that sort of 
 But do you do you think that this is the fault
of the students only ?
This is the fault of students only because 
the students themselves
 No no 
Authorities I suppose
No no no if the students uh do one thing you know 
they can't do anything they will just keep quite
There are two types of students one is that uh cool type
 He'll just go on with the studies and doesn't bother about
what yeah exactly is going around
Other type is that type they'll just interact with those
very hoodlums 
 Yeah 
Yeah
Just to be on the safe side
Yeah yeah 
Now this is two types
The cool type will never do anything
And the hoodlums just doesn't keep quite
But this
At that time I think it is the duty of the authorities to
just have the matter straight 
 I've heard that jubilee people even most of the jubilee
people I'll say appreciated it 
Yeah
Particularly lot of uh the many guys who were
arrested in mid-terms 
 No because the image so see the
 That's important
No
But it never went to that
Created in the paper
No no no now see in our hostel that is different 
because we realise of course there are a couple of students we just 
mean they just seem to stay without
Just listen this really is one very important thing
That any uni uni university especially in post-graduate
courses there is no clearcut I mean time limit for session 
and so you see in hostel they will say you
 No no no 
There is a clearcut no time limit but 
 then only for those people 
 No 
 How only somebody has got some problem in
enrollment 
This is its only for those people who don't have much say 
who can't shout it's only for those
Rules are there but they apply only to people who are
How could people were living from six or seven years and
nobody went and asked that these people were 
 Because there is sort of gadbad 
That does us that's it that does us they
seem to take out a knife a few words 
 No it is no because even authorities what
 I'm saying that the authorities were were the main responsible
persons you see 
That they did not take care of the hostel and after that when
somebody is dropped there and it is there 
No
Some personal interest that's why they 
The authorities in the beginning for example take your 
this Pundit was there 
Yeah
See what he is used to do he used to interact with
those very people 
And if he wanted to get somebody one word 
going down in a very bad way 
He used to meet them and he used to manage that
 So he uh 
No he was a
But he didn't get one word in it
He doesn't want their help because I've heard that he
himself claim to be a goonda or something he was a 
goonda 
Yeah yeah that's what I'm saying
No he is not afraid of those people 
Yeah
But the Pundit he because of his own act he used to
do it
No he
He used to take the help of those
He he never he never did take help
 I've I've heard there was one chap in uh
 jubilee who said that uh I can't do anything about uh this
guy uh Pundit because see he has helped me he has given the hostel to
this person who didn't have any right to the hostel he gave one word 
to this person because of my one word 
Uhn
But the thing is in our case that's it if its
okay in that case the authorities is itelf responsible unless authorities
 one word it is not corrupt they can't do anything 
No but you see
And students were supported
Students or you see a student cannot be a
very gentleman
 Two words 
No no I'll tell you in my hostel there are about
 ten boys who are sort of dadas you can say
clearcut dadas 
And there are other one eighty guys one seventy guys you can say
who are this cool type
Okay this ten people will go fifty people will be watching
their particular programme on T V 
And uh these ten people will go and they'll do all of
a sudden they'll come without saying anything they will simply turn
the channel to the particular programme they are are not 
 Then you can thus agree it was the authorities
were responsible there 
 Wait wait 
What happened is they will change programme and the fifty
guys they'll just keep quite 
 It's not the fault of those ten guys it is the fault of
fifty guys who just keep quite 
Why do they keep quite ?
Yeah
Okay if I want to watch that programme that is
not my one word I have to fight for it yeah 
otherwise I can't watch it
 One word 
 Yeah 
Yeah no doubt 
There are two things only either you join those people
 or you fight those people 
No there are
And one thing about those people is when they realise that
somebody is capable of fighting them back they will just join him they
will just keep him in means they have very good term with him
All the one word which is temporary you know
controversial matter laughs 
No no no
But after all
I don't think it's a controversial
What do you think about your department infact uh about
your study and the way they teach students here ?
Well fine 
Yes 
Uhm it's okay 
Do you think that there should be something else which should
be included 
No I don't think 
I think 
It should be
No no department okay syllabus is also okay 
The teachers are okay 
And they give proper
Only thing is that uh the avenue should be large
Avenue should be
Job avenues and all
Facilities
There is no job avenue facilities are also okay I think
No no facilities to students and those who get get the
degree
Yeah
They didn't have an opportunity
There don't have any opportunity
Yeah 
Almost zero 
 That's why no instrumnetal motivation and just
adding one word 
 laughs 
A zero
 That's very good 
Ah don't you think that the the teachers should continue this
department uh during late evening too ?
That the students come
No it is difference difference in the students I don't
think students feel that there is any need of it 
Yeah
I think just two words I have been here now for I
think three and half years and I feel it's okay 
It depends on the students if you want to carry on studies you can
just go to lab and study whatsoever you like and if you feel the need of
They all think that we cannot study but they if they want to
 co co consult
He can he can consult I don't think there is any problem
so far I've never faced any problem
Whenever I feel somehow I've gone to any Professor
and he has been very glad to help me 
Yeah
I feel so I don't know
