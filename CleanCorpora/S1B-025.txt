<I>
This is All India Radio 
Taking sides in our national programme tonight we bring you a
discussion on media attitudes in the context of privatisation of the
electronic media 
Since only the very rich can afford these private channels will
the content of their programme reflect their bias and the bias of the
advertisers 
The programmes be aimed only at those who can afford them 
All those who run these channels be persuaded to aim them at the
poor and the backward 
We view the electronic media as an instrument of social and
economic upliftment 
In short will the social attitude and economic compulsions of
the fourth estate force them as it has in the past to take sides
Taking part in the discussion are Kuldeep Nayyar the emminent
 coloumnist Madhu Trehan executive producer News Track P C
Chatterji former director general All India Radio and B G Verghese
 the noted columnist who also moderates the discussion 
We are discussing this evening uh social attitudes on
the part of the media uh broadcast print and the other 
But the very main point to start with the is the
discussion that has been initiated uh rising out of the congress
manifesto which suggest the need for privatisation uh
broadcasting or atleast some competitive challenge through public 
co-operation 
Will this really change broadcasting ?
Will the content of programmes undergo any change ?
And will the viewers and listeners get something more 
different from what they get now ?
Uh Madhu what do you think ?
 First first of all I think the
government has to make its position clear 
Nothing has been clarified by the minister about what exactly
they are planning to do 
Uh there is a lot of confusion and if this is any indication
for what the new channel is going to be like I don't think there will be much
opening up 
First of all they have to take a de 
decision on whether they are going to clear Doordarshan
 because if they do open up a second channel as it should be 
as one one word a free channel then who would watch 
Doordarshan 
So they have to take a very gutsy decision 
We are two words Doordarshan to open up a
channel
I don't know if any government do have the guts to do that in India
today
I a few words suggestion that the government
channel state channel existing channel be extinguished 
 Prasar Bharati will take over
That will be there will be a transformation as far as All
India Radio and Doordarshan are concerned 
And then the other will be a private or competitive channel or
channels 
But who will watch it ?
Who will watch uh Doordarshan when you have a
private channel to compete ?
Well let's ask Kuldeep and
Then they will have to improve 
Actually the analysis is if Doordarshan is
just like what it is today nobody will switch it on 
But uh if there is a private uh channel which is producing
a better programme naturally Doordarshan will have to 
produce better or not to see it 
But George I don't know my feeling is ki 
this whole thing is being confused purposely 
I think the government does not want to impliment any 
Prasar Bharati Bill 
And the whole thing
 A few words 
 I'm sorry I'm sorry it's a mess
now 
So it the whole thing has been introduced just to delay
 postpone things
I don't think the government is serious about giving 
control of this media in the hands of independent people uh though
government control still states but state government is not willing to
 part ways with that kind of authority
Well let us presume that the idea is to go ahead
 with the Prasar Bharati Act
Though it's been very slow 
Uh in the circumstances then how should we proceed 
Now as a former Director General of All India Radio or
Broadcasting what would you say 
Well the first thing that government has to do is to
invite legislation to set up its body an independent body which is
going to assign frequently 
 It's not the government that has it in a in few
countries it is an independent body that does it 
The next thing is to draw up the sort of priorities that you
want of the alternative programmes that you think to 
 of continuing 
Yes it is 
If the only alternative that you can think of is commercial 
then probably uh uhm there may be trouble but I think it's 
a mistake to suppose Madhu as you as I think you were making 
Mainly that if uh a private channel comes or a
commercial channel nobody will watch Doordarshan 
one word or listen to All India Radio 
Fact is that people thought that would happen to the B B C
It didn't
The B B C still does mm control a vast section of the
audience
So what's the loss 
But they still do and we are still setting the standard for 
for what ought to be insat doing 
Now the question is on what basis do we allot channels ?
But the the basic question is why count and
change ?
What do you want broadcasting to do in terms of what it is
now and what it might be ?
And what is the kind of change that you would envy in
terms of the new order 
Yes which we are thinking of uh a second channel 
again in the hands of the people who are going to compete uh who are
going to attract more listeners and viewers on the basis of 
showing may be some films or programmes which is is really in that
consumerism 
Now my feeling is ke the purpose is partly
lost 
Consumerism would be end of what middle classes you say
Yes definitely
For example the ho how do
we ensure in this country that uh this vast country where
the people have certain other kind of ethos 
How do we appeal to them ?
Because if this second channel comes and it is competitive
 as it should be 
And if it is in the hands of some people who can afford it 
then there aim would be to one word 
 That's right
 They're not very who are going to be worried
about uh you can do it do it some programmes for the uplift of the people
I think they may need more than two channels 
Maybe third channel or may be fourth channel 
Some channel given to the university some ch 
 channel given to the people 
Because the purpose I have in view is of course one view is
 of course entertainment one word 
But other way I think is we must do something for the
uplift of the people 
Use the TV use the whatever this medium is for
uh fighting some prejudices 
Right
Like that
Well let's ask Madhu here
Well I think
What kind of content would you have if you were to have
 this opportunity ?
I think uh I disaggre with Ku 
Kuldeep in that
But I don't think there is a hard line between uh social
purpose uplift of the people and entertainment 
I think that had been the problem with Doordarshan 
 that it catagorised so strictly that either it's cheap vulgar
entertainment or it is boring programmes for education which is so
boring that nobody in the right mind can watch 
I think that what has to be done is that there has to be a merger
of the two an infertainment 
And up uplift of people will
come from people who want to watch programmes which is so interesting
that they don't know whether they are being educated and their prejudices are
being broken down 
Things like that like uh uh the tragedy that took place in
Sindhu recently where lower caste people have been uh butchered and
put in gunny bags 
I don't think that kind of film would be possible if an emotional
beautiful film was made which made the higher caste people aware of
the feelings
And made the the lower caste mess anonymous to them
I think the large part of it is the anonimity 
So I think that all this I think that just making money making
revenues is looked down upon 
I don't think that so I think that making re 
 revenue should be uh tied-up with the fact that you
know that you can make money by doing things that will move people
Right
But we hear uh you are really talking about uh news 
and uh daily affairs current affairs 
What about extention education other things that are not really
marketable ?
Where would the money come from and what would it cost to put
up such a channel such a network ?
Because there is no scope in just of the metro or the larger
cities or the country as a whole
And we talk of people which are these people that we are
talking about ?
Where do they live ?
What is their level of understanding ?
What language do they understand ?
 Is it is it English or is it all our
fourteen schedule languages and numerous other unscheduled and tribal
languages 
Then don't you know that it is a major issue because what
you are talking about the languages 
If there is any say four or five privatisation is concerned if 
they 
Again time and again we have dealt with this problem and 
 uhm and on radio I think you've you have got to do
it
 Uhm 
But you have also to be interested in going
outside the framework of All India Radio and and Doordarshan
How would you address this problem which people what caste 
how do you one word 
You see uh a programme to uh not very well up and what
the cost would be on television but I know that there would be some thing
like ten times 
Uh atleast ten times if not for uh for uh a one word 
worth in capital and then the exenditure
But take a small thing like one word radio 
that is people are they are interested in each other they have
common problem they come and participate they discuss their problem
 then they go ahead and try to do something better 
Now uh I mean the question is where does the money
come from ?
Well I think we really have to go out into the market to
see where the money is and where it comes from 
This opposition that people are not interested in uh a in
anything but making money 
Uh I think it's a mistake 
There are any number of trust they're running
hospitals 
 They're doing various other things 
If the said uh uh potential in radio and television
 I'm sure they will come forward
Now you told us about look up station video or radio 
even otherwise 
 We're talking about four five six crores
 not more than that 
But you know I'm talking of national hook-ups 
When we're talking of hundreds of crores 
 Kuldeep where do you think uh uh our options lie ?
Because broadcasting has been very much talked down in the sense
 we've national broadcasting then regional broadcasting local
broadcasting in the sense is yet to come
The communities 
Now if you think of starting from the bottom then it
becomes managable
As you have said you have a hospital or you have a school or
university people want to spend that
Because the career teaching is that it needs it and
 it's useful 
Our teacher talking about current affairs talk
 talking about you know since it is a very high
level 
Then one is really talking about films that may be a of of
 of uh interest to high guard people to well educated
people and to very weak 
Otherwise we're talking to farmers simple people in
their language 
How would they manage this ?
This is the question I'll ask to ask to Kuldeep and
Madhu you also
Because this is really were the boiling butter comes
in 
I think the idea of a local station is a very good idea
I think it's been tried abroad 
Uh and uh I think while Madhu was commenting on my uh 
vocation that I one word counter view I one word I
think Mr Madhu was missing one side of it and that is what I want
to answer 
And it is take for example the Mandal Commission
 report 
How many people really explained what it meant 
Of course our TV picked up the stories that little boys were
killed the boys were that
But this look here this is wrong with the Hindu society
 that here is a society which has not treated human beings as human being
for thousands of years 
Maybe this was the wrong idea to be the way it was done
But was it exploited if these now stations are there 
Maybe these were like small kinds of uh outlets 
Maybe these are the places where we can drop again this thing
because these are the people from below 
These are the people at the grass roots and help them to
overcome their prejudices
Kuldeep I wanted to button there if I may
And also doing one or two words what Madhu was speaking
In a programme of that kind what is happening to people in
different parts of India I think uh the important thing is not
that you tell people who know about themselves
But you tell others in different parts of the country that
look this is how people are living in a certain part
The network would be important
And I think uh Madhu where I very much agree with you 
there is enormous interest of people in other people 
We know next to nothing but so many extremely interesting
groups in our country and I think television could and radio
could help the broadcast
But can we do that ?
Unless there is some kind of a right unless there is some
kind of break up unless there is some vague one word nothing
alse can work
 In that way Kuldeep is one thing that nobody
can disagree with the regional station
I think that is the way that that India should go
Because with that many languages I think it'll be
crucial if we give uh local stations atleast a certain amount of 
hours before the before the national hook-up 
 One or to words 
I think we're talking about explaining to people
about why something like Mandal took place
About the vote bank 
I think that's their patronising 
I think that I don't think we have to explain 
I think what we have to do is to bring whatever is happening
 to them and deal and and show that this is not this a channel 
this is a person this is human being this is what's 
happening 
And I think I trust our people one word Indians
 wherever we live in India that they will respond that they
will feel that yes this is the child who had been hurt and this is the
woman that had been raped this is the man that has suffered injustice
 and I think people will really respond when we when we remove the
anonimity that we have of each other instead of the formality and the
distances 
Which is something that our electronic media has done
And when we see constantly you see on programmes people
are fake they are artificial nobody talks like that they normally
do in their life even the language is is not colloquial
