This is All India Radio 
""
""
discussion on media attitudes in the context of privatisation of the
""
""
""
""
advertisers 
""
The programmes be aimed only at those who can afford them 
""
""
poor 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 P C
""
""
""
""
""
the part of the media 
""
But the very main point to start with  is the
""
""
broadcasting or atleast 
""
""
Will this really change  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
they are planning to do 
""
Uh there is a lot of confusion and if  this is any indication
for what the new channel is going to be like I don't think there will be much
""
""
First of all they have to take a 
decision  Doordarshan
""
as one 
""
""
""
""
We are  to open up a
channel
""
I don't know if any government do have the guts to do that in India
today
""
""
""
channel 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then the other will be a private or competitive channel or
""
""
""
""
""
Who will watch  when you have a
private channel to compete ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the whole thing
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
invite legislation  an independent body which is
""
""
""
countries it is an independent body that does it 
""
""
want 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Fact is that people thought that would happen to the B B C
""
It didn't
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
terms of the new 
""
""
Yes which we are thinking of uh 
""
going to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the people have certain 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if it is in the hands of some people 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right
""
""
Like that
""
""
""
""
""
Well I think
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Kuldeep  in that
""
But I don't think there is a hard line  social
""
""
I think that had been the problem with 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Things like that like uh  uh the tragedy that took place in
""
put in gunny bags 
""
""
beautiful film was made  aware of
""
""
And made the  anonymous to them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But we hear 
""
""
""
marketable ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 or is it all our
fourteen schedule languages and numerous other unscheduled and tribal
""
""
""
""
""
""
If there is any say four or five privatisation is concerned if 
""
""
""
""
 you have got to do
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How would you address this problem which people 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that is people are  they have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
see where the money is and where it comes from 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
hospitals 
""
""
""
If the  potential in radio and television
""
""
""
Now you told us about 
even otherwise 
""
 crores
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
 local
broadcasting in the sense is yet to come
""
""
""
""
""
""
becomes managable
""
""
""
""
Because the  and
""
""
""
 you know since it is a very high
""
""
""
 to well educated
""
""
Otherwise  simple people in
""
""
""
""
This is the question  ask to Kuldeep and
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think the idea of a local station  is a very good idea
""
""
""
""
""
think Mr Madhu was missing  and that is what I want
""
""
And it is  Mandal Commission
""
""
How many people really explained 
""
""
""
""
""
""
for thousands of years 
""
""
""
""
""
Maybe these were like 
""
""
""
""
""
overcome their prejudices
""
""
""
""
And also doing  what Madhu was speaking
""
""
In a programme of that kind what is happening to people in
different parts of India  not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I think 
""
""
""
groups in our country  and radio
""
""
""
But can we do that ?
""
""
Unless there is some kind of a right  unless there is some
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because with that many languages  be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think 
""
""
""
""
""
this is a person 
""
""
And I think  Indians
""
will feel  that yes this is the child who had been hurt and this is the
woman that had been raped  suffered injustice
""
""
distances 
""
""
""
""
