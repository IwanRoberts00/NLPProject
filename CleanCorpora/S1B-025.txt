This is All India Radio 
""
Taking sides  in our national programme tonight we bring you a
discussion on media attitudes in the context of privatisation of the
electronic media 
""
Since only the very rich can afford these private channels  will
the content of their programme reflect their bias  and the bias of the
advertisers 
""
The programmes be aimed only at those who can afford them 
""
All those who run these channels  be persuaded to aim them at the
poor 
""
We view the electronic media  as an instrument of social and
economic upliftment 
""
In short will the social attitude and economic compulsions  of
the fourth estate  to take sides
""
""
Taking part in the discussion are Kuldeep Nayyar  the emminent
 P C
Chatterji former director general All India Radio  B G Verghese
""
""
""
We are discussing this evening  on
the part of the media 
""
But the very main point to start with  is the
discussion that has been initiated  uh rising out of the congress
manifesto  uh
broadcasting or atleast 
co-operation 
""
Will this really change  ?
""
Will the content of programmes  ?
""
And will the viewers and listeners get something more 
different  ?
""
Uh Madhu  ?
""
""
 of all I think the
government has to make its position clear 
""
Nothing has been clarified by the minister  about what exactly
they are planning to do 
""
Uh there is a lot of confusion and if  this is any indication
for what the new channel is going to be like I don't think there will be much
opening up 
""
First of all they have to take a 
decision  Doordarshan
""
as one 
Doordarshan 
""
So they have to take a very gutsy decision 
""
We are  to open up a
channel
""
I don't know if any government do have the guts to do that in India
today
""
""
I  government
channel 
""
 will take over
""
That will be  as far as All
India Radio and 
""
And then the other will be a private or competitive channel or
channels 
""
""
But who will watch it  ?
""
Who will watch  when you have a
private channel to compete ?
""
""
Well  and
""
""
Then they will have to improve 
""
Actually the analysis is  is
just like what it is today nobody will 
""
But uh  channel which is producing
a better programme naturally 
produce better 
""
But George 
this 
""
I think the government does not want to impliment any 
Prasar Bharati 
""
And the whole thing
""
""
""
""
""
 a mess
now 
""
So  the whole thing has been introduced just to delay
 postpone things
""
I don't think the government is serious 
control of this media  uh though
government control still states  but state government is not willing to
 part ways with that kind of authority
""
""
Well let us presume  go ahead
 Act
""
Though 
""
Uh in the circumstances then how should we proceed 
""
Now as a former  All India Radio or
Broadcasting 
""
""
Well the first thing that government has to do  is to
invite legislation  an independent body which is
going to assign frequently 
""
 in few
countries it is an independent body that does it 
""
The next thing is to draw up  the sort of priorities that you
want 
""
""
Yes it is 
""
If the only alternative that you can think of 
then probably uh uhm 
a mistake to suppose Madhu as you 
""
Mainly  comes or a
commercial channel 
one word 
""
Fact is that people thought that would happen to the B B C
""
It didn't
""
The B B C still does  a vast section of the
audience
""
So 
""
But they still do 
for what ought to be 
""
Now the question is  ?
""
""
But the  count and
change ?
""
What do you want broadcasting to do  what it is
now  and what it might be ?
""
And what is the kind of change that you would  in
terms of the new 
""
""
Yes which we are thinking of uh 
again in the hands of the people  uh who are
going to 
showing may be  films or programmes which is is really in that
consumerism 
""
Now my feeling is  the purpose is partly
lost 
""
""
Consumerism would be end of what  middle classes you say
""
""
Yes definitely
""
For example  do
we  where
the people have certain 
""
How do we appeal to them ?
""
Because  and it is competitive
""
""
And if it is in the hands of some people 
then there aim would be 
""
""
 right
""
""
 who are going to be worried
about  uh you can do it do it some programmes for the uplift of the people
""
""
I think they may need more than two channels 
""
Maybe third channel 
""
Some channel given to the university 
""
""
Because  of course one view is
""
""
But  the
uplift of the people 
""
Use  for
uh 
""
""
Right
""
""
Like that
""
""
Well  Madhu here
""
""
Well I think
""
""
What kind of content would you  have if you were to have
 ?
""
""
I think uh 
Kuldeep  in that
""
But I don't think there is a hard line  social
purpose 
""
I think that had been the problem with 
 cheap vulgar
entertainment  boring programmes for education which is so
boring that nobody in the right mind can watch 
""
I think that what has to be done is that there has to be a merger
of the two 
""
And  of people will
come from people who want to watch programmes  which is so interesting
that they don't know whether they are being educated and their prejudices are
being broken down 
""
Things like that like uh  uh the tragedy that took place in
Sindhu recently where  butchered and
put in gunny bags 
""
I don't think that kind of film would be possible if an emotional
beautiful film was made  aware of
the feelings
""
And made the  anonymous to them
""
""
I think the large part of it is the anonimity 
""
So I think that all this  I think that just making money making
revenues is looked down upon 
""
I don't think that so I think that making 
 that you
know that you can make money by doing things that will move people
""
""
Right
""
But we hear 
and uh 
""
What about extention  education other things that are not really
marketable ?
""
Where would the money come from  and what would it cost to put
up  ?
""
Because there is no scope in just of the metro  or the larger
cities  or the country as a whole
""
And we talk of people  which are these people that we are
talking about ?
""
Where do they live  ?
""
What is their level of understanding  ?
""
What language do they understand ?
""
 or is it all our
fourteen schedule languages and numerous other unscheduled and tribal
languages 
""
""
Then don't you know that it is a major issue because  what
you are talking about the languages 
""
If there is any say four or five privatisation is concerned if 
they 
""
""
Again time and again we have dealt with this problem and 
 you have got to do
it
""
""
""
""
""
But you have also  in going
outside the framework  Doordarshan
""
""
How would you address this problem which people 
how do you 
""
""
You see uh a programme to uh  not very well up and what
the cost would be on television but I know that there would be some thing
like ten times 
""
Uh atleast ten times if not for uh 
worth in capital and then the exenditure
""
But 
that is people are  they have
common problem  they discuss their problem
""
""
""
Now uh I mean  where does the money
come from  ?
""
""
Well  I think we really have to go out into the market to
see where the money is and where it comes from 
""
This opposition that people are not interested in uh  a in
anything but making money 
""
Uh I think 
""
There are any number of trust  running
hospitals 
""
""
""
If the  potential in radio and television
 sure they will come forward
""
""
Now you told us about 
even otherwise 
""
 crores
""
""
But you know 
""
When 
 ?
""
Because broadcasting has been very much talked down in the sense
 local
broadcasting in the sense is yet to come
""
""
The communities 
""
""
Now  if you think of starting from the bottom then it
becomes managable
""
As  you have said you have a hospital or you have a school or
university  people want to spend that
""
Because the  and
""
""
Our teacher talking about current affairs  talk
 you know since it is a very high
level 
""
Then one is really talking about  of
 to well educated
people 
""
Otherwise  simple people in
their language 
""
How would they manage this ?
""
This is the question  ask to Kuldeep and
Madhu you also
""
Because this is really  butter comes
in 
""
""
I think the idea of a local station  is a very good idea
""
I think 
""
Uh and uh 
vocation  I
think Mr Madhu was missing  and that is what I want
to answer 
""
And it is  Mandal Commission
""
""
How many people really explained 
""
Of course  our TV picked up the stories that little boys were
killed  the boys were that
""
But  this is wrong with the Hindu society
 that here is a society which has not treated human beings as human being
for thousands of years 
""
Maybe this was the wrong idea to be the way it was done
""
But was it 
""
Maybe these were like 
""
Maybe these are the places where we can drop again this thing
because these are the people from below 
""
These are the people at the grass roots  and help them to
overcome their prejudices
""
""
Kuldeep I wanted to button there if I may
""
And also doing  what Madhu was speaking
""
""
In a programme of that kind what is happening to people in
different parts of India  not
that you tell people who know about themselves
""
But you tell others  in different parts of the country that
look  this is how people are living in a certain part
""
The network would be important
""
And I think 
there is enormous interest of people 
""
We know  extremely interesting
groups in our country  and radio
could  help the broadcast
""
""
But can we do that ?
""
""
Unless there is some kind of a right  unless there is some
kind of break up  nothing
alse can work
""
""
 is one thing that nobody
can disagree with the regional station
""
I think that is the way that  that India should go
""
Because with that many languages  be
crucial if we give 
hours before the 
""
""
""
""
""
I think  talking about explaining to people
about why something like  took place
""
About the vote bank 
""
I think 
""
I think that I don't think we have to explain 
""
I think what we have to do is to bring  whatever is happening
""
this is a person 
happening 
""
And I think  Indians
 that they
will feel  that yes this is the child who had been hurt and this is the
woman that had been raped  suffered injustice
 the
anonimity that we have of each other instead of the formality and the
distances 
""
Which is something that our electronic media has done
""
And when we see  people
are fake  they normally
do in their life
