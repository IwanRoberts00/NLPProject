What stupid ideas are getting hold of all of us 
And the teachers have also become trade unionists 
They also hold the university 
I mean who who is the university ?
The Vice-chancellor of the university or the teachers who teach
they are the university 
It is an association 
This is my definition university is an association of
students and teachers in pursuit of scholarship 
Scholarship is the only measure of the performance of the
university 
If you don't have scholarship you are nothing 
And we want teachers who are great scholars like those
great Rishis of ancient times 
People who are dedicated who are motivated whose whole purpose is
 the pursuit of knowledge and the application of knowledge to the
contemporary problems 
Now we have to produce such man such power such knowledge
power in our universities 
I am very fond of constantly quoting the ideas of John Kenneth
Galbraith the economist who has pointed out that in the
feudal times or even the earlier times slave times the 
your wealth depended on the number of slaves you can command 
I have one thousand slaves at my disposal I am a bigger man 
than another with hundred slaves at his disposal 
Then came feudalism and they said that a man who has one
thousand acres is bigger than a man who owns
hundred acres 
So the land that was the measure of feudalism 
Then came capitalism 
If I have one crore or I am a millionnaire I
am bigger than a man who has only some hundreds 
Money became the measure 
So control over men was the measure at one phase of the history 
over land in the second phase of history over money in the third phase of
history
Now what is the measure of today ?
What is the measure of today ?
The knowledge that you produce 
The knowledge that you apply 
Knowledge is the measure of performance today 
Therefore universities have to be successive from this
point of view they have to produce knowledge
Now there is poverty of research in the Indian university 
whether in science natural sciences social sciences
No uh new idea generates no new research has come out no
new books are prepared some useless text-books are prepared and they
are the stuff nutrition on which the student community is fed 
Now with such poor nutrition of third rate text-books I
mean you ask the students of economics he has not read journals 
John Maynard Keynes' general theory of employment interest
in money one word 
Kanes who is that ?
And what is his book ?
And why should we read it ?
Now this is our way of looking at things 
So uh we need to give great attention to the quality of
teachers and to the quality of students 
And the academic staff colleges are intended to produce a better
quality of teachers
A very good idea 
I hope academic staff colleges also do not deteriorate 
And do not become a ritual 
You see there has to be a perennial and continous
process of renewal to be just what we are 
Even a Vice- chancellor will not be of any use unless he renews
himself constantly 
By the one word that I have diclosed in the last few
minutes you would have known by now that I am not such an ignorant
person about the scene of higher education 
After all I was not an educationist I was in the Indian
administration 
But I have been constantly reading about the scene of higher
education
In fact I began after the moment I came here I said where
is Radhakrishnan Commission ?
Let me see it first 
Where is Kothari Commission ?
Where are the other what are the other writing ?
What are the new thoughts ? 
So nobody should take any field without becoming a thorough 
 pandit in that particular field that is the mark and that is
the approach of an academic 
Even as an administrator I followed the same method 
Now I might have been wanting thoroughly but at least that was
my effort and that was my approach 
So therefore how do we continuously recharge the batteries
of our teachers 
Now this is a recharging battery academic staff college is a
battery recharging process 
So that when you go you are brightened refreshed you
are a new person and your personality changes and the students must say
 is this the same teacher who has come back 
Some thing has gone wrong but you know you become different teacher
This is what should happen after you go back 
You must be full of new ideas full of new energies full of new
approaches 
You must electrify the atmosphere when you go back
This is this is the mark of success of a programme like I hope
it will happen here also 
You must go and electrify the atmosphere when you go back 
The movement you go back the brightness must spread 
So will this happen ?
You see there are even in modern times we believe that
in addition to self-teaching or teaching on the job yourself there is
an institution of process involved 
I belong to the great Indian administrative service which is
the successor to a greater what people call a greater service for the
Indian civil service of the colonial times 
Now in those days there was no training 
The I C S did not believe in this kind of formal our institutional
training 
They believed in training on the job 
The senior man trains the junior fellow 
And in those days the links betweeen the senior and the junior
 were more personal 
Yes there is also something in that 
But there is also more in the process of institutionalization
And it is only after in independence 
 that a number of institutions of training of civil servants
came into existence
It became a big business 
And that is how in my career I headed no less than four 
institutions of research and training connected with one part or the
other of our administrative system 
Uh Rajiv Gandhi was a great believer and the first question
he asked was whether chief secretary of the states and the join
secretary at the centre or even the secretaries and ministers whether
they were getting any training 
This is the question Rajiv Gandhi asked 
It was part of his modernism 
And as a result of that for the first time for the big bossess
 who consider themselves beyond all training ministers are beyond all
training they don't need anything they know everything and the in
Hindi I A S fellow knows everything 
Now that theory is no longer considered to be valid 
And he definitely the credit of starting such
programme for higher civil servants and ministers goes to Rajiv
Gandhi 
Though I must say in the earlier days of S K Dey where I
was also the director we use to get senior civil servants as well as even
ministers in those days MLA's 
But in recent times in the whole gamut of public administration
this was started 
Now the U G C has started it on the academic side the same who
is good you cannot be standard
Now our teachers are notorious for using the same notes for
the whole of the teaching career 
What was given by Dhananjayrao Gadgil when I passed my M A same
notes I go on using for twenty-five years 
Now the fact of the matter is such is the dynamism of
knowledge the explosion of knowledge what that what you said
yesterday does not hold good today 
A syllabus came in economics and it said the socialistic
economic system experience of Russia and East European countries
Now where is socialism ?
What kind of socialism are you talking of ?
Things change so rapidly not only in the realm of
knowledge but also in the external world 
And the objectives of programme such as this is to constantly
 bring you up today both in your subject matter because we have
subject matter programmes in respect of methodology which is also
important methodology of teaching 
And thirdly the general environment in which you work 
University is considered to be an Ivory tower
Yes to an extent it is an Ivory tower 
But this Ivory tower of education is not unconnected with
the economic environment social environment political environment
technological environment cultural environment in which we carry on our whole
process of education 
And therefore we ought to know this environment 
We cannot be frogs in the well dealing only with a commerce
accountancy and the like
I mean you have to know the whole frame-work 
And therefore this general programme of orientation which
will tell you about the changing environment in politics 
economics in society in technology in culture within India and
without India 
I therefore hope that uh such a programme will not be
considered by you an irrelevant 
What is this programme it is not in the syllabus of Botany ?
This is not a question to be asked here 
We are not here concern with Botany or Zoology or Economics or
Commerce or Political Science or Education or Hindi or English in pursuing
We are concerned with these wider frame-work 
And I hope that uh you will understand the importance of these
wider frame-work that you will interact I mean in all this it is
not the traditional process where the teacher knows everything and
the student now it has become reverse
The student feels that he knows everything and the teacher
knows nothing and he talks some nonsense and we have to tolerate 
This is the new approach to education that seems to be
evolving in our country 
A student in Goa university got ten marks and he failed and he
promptly writes me ten letters saying that the teachers don't know uh
how to uh evaluate and they have wrongly put me at ten and it is a
great injustice to me 
Now what do you do ?
Therefore we have to create the institutional approach
 for the enhancement and the upgradation of the capability of our teachers
But much will depend on the teachers themselves
How you participate ?
What you get of the programme will depend will depend on 
how you what effort you made to get out the programme 
If you come out if you bring up your ideas and your
experience and to share it with others you will find that apart from
the expert who'll be giving you lectures you will benefit more
by your interaction with each other 
This will be your transformation from a teacher you will
become a student from an older person you will suddenly become a young
person 
This transformation I hope the programme will bring about 
It a programme like this makes you younger it reduces your
age straight by twenty years 
So if you are forty your age becomes twenty 
And that happens for a teacher also 
The teacher should not go on uh blabbering in an old way 
but uh he must come out with all the energy of new knowledge and new
curiosity and the pleasure that is there between communication 
between human beings 
Communication between human beings is a very big process 
It changes 
It is not communication of one from one to one 
One becomes hundred in the process of communication 
So I hope all these processes will take place and as a
result of uh this programme you will go happier uh more uh delighted
refreshed committed and uh you will then go back and would
not keep what you have taken to yourselves 
But would share it with your fellow teachers with your
colleagues with your students and with the academic community of
which you are a part 
So in all this uh process of education and its dessimination
 I wish you all very well 
I don't know whether what I have said amounts to any key note
address 
I had not uh prepared myself formally to deliever it but uh
 I share what I felt on the occasion with you all 
Once again I must uh give my heartful thanks to the
Vice-chancellor for uh allowing us to come here and provide the
forum for the conduct of the activities of the academic staff college 
And I am grateful to Dr Devasthali for providing the
co-ordination at the level here in this university 
I thank them heartly on behalf of Goa university and on behalf
of myself 
And I wish well to you to the participants in the
programme and to the programme itself
Thank you very much
