What stupid 
""
And the teachers have also become trade unionists 
""
They also hold the university 
""
I mean who who is the university ?
""
The Vice-chancellor of the university  or the teachers who teach
they are the university 
""
It is an association 
""
This is my definition  of
students and teachers in pursuit of scholarship 
""
Scholarship is the only  of the performance of the
university 
""
If you don't have scholarship you are nothing 
""
And we want teachers  like those
great 
""
People who are dedicated who are motivated whose whole purpose is
 and the application of knowledge to the
contemporary problems 
""
Now we have to produce such man  such knowledge
power 
""
I  am very fond of constantly quoting the ideas of John Kenneth
Galbraith  in the
feudal times or even the earlier times 
your wealth depended on the number of slaves you can command 
""
I have one thousand slaves at my disposal I am a bigger man 
than another with hundred slaves at his disposal 
""
Then came feudalism  that a man who has one
thousand  a man who owns
hundred 
""
So the land 
""
Then came capitalism 
""
If I have one  or I am a millionnaire I
am bigger than 
""
Money became the measure 
""
So control over men was the measure at one phase of the history 
over land in the second phase of history  over money in the third phase of
history
""
Now what is the measure of today  ?
""
What is the measure of today  ?
""
The knowledge that you produce 
""
The knowledge that you apply 
""
Knowledge is the measure of performance today 
""
Therefore  have to be successive from this
point of view they have to produce knowledge
""
Now there is poverty of research in the Indian university 
whether in science  natural sciences social sciences
""
No uh new idea generates  no
new books are  some useless text-books are prepared and they
are the 
""
Now with such poor nutrition  I
mean you ask the students of economics 
""
John Maynard  general theory of employment interest
in money 
""
Kanes who is that  ?
""
And what is his book  ?
""
And why should we read it  ?
""
Now this is our way of looking at things 
""
So  uh we need to give great attention to the quality of
teachers and to the quality of students 
""
And the academic staff colleges are intended to produce a better
quality of teachers
""
A very good idea 
""
I hope academic staff colleges also do not deteriorate 
""
And do not become a ritual 
""
You see  and continous
process of renewal 
""
Even a Vice- chancellor will not be of any use unless he renews
himself constantly 
""
By the  that I have diclosed in the last few
minutes you would have  that I am not such an ignorant
person about the scene of higher education 
""
After all I was not an educationist  I was in the Indian
administration 
""
But I have been constantly reading about the  scene of higher
education
""
In fact I began after the moment I came here I said  where
is Radhakrishnan Commission ?
""
Let me see it first 
""
Where is Kothari Commission  ?
""
Where are the other  what are the other writing ?
""
What are the new thoughts 
""
So nobody should take any field 
 in that particular field that is the mark and that is
the approach of an academic 
""
Even as an administrator I followed the same method 
""
Now I might have been wanting thoroughly  but at least that was
my effort and that was my approach 
""
So  how do we continuously recharge the batteries
of our teachers 
""
Now this is a recharging battery academic staff college  is a
battery recharging process 
""
So that when you go  you
are a new person  and your personality changes and the students must say
""
""
Some thing has gone wrong but you know you become different teacher
""
""
This is what should happen 
""
You must be full of new ideas full of new energies  full of new
approaches 
""
You must electrify the atmosphere when you go back
""
This is  this is the mark of success of a programme like I hope
it will happen here also 
""
You must go and electrify 
""
The movement you go back 
""
So will this happen  ?
""
You see  that
in addition to self-teaching  there is
an institution of process involved 
""
I belong to the great Indian administrative service  which is
the  the
Indian civil service 
""
Now in those days there was no training 
""
The I C S did not believe in this kind of formal our institutional
training 
""
They believed in training on the job 
""
The senior man trains the 
""
And in those days  the links betweeen the senior and the junior
""
""
Yes there is also something in that 
""
But there is also more  in the process of institutionalization
""
""
And it is only after 
 of civil servants
came into existence
""
It became a big business 
""
And that is how in my career I headed 
institutions  of research and training connected with one part or the
other 
""
Uh  and the first question
he asked was  and the join
secretary at the centre or even the secretaries and ministers  whether
they were getting any training 
""
This is the question Rajiv Gandhi asked 
""
It was part of his modernism 
""
And as a result of that  for the first time for the big bossess
 ministers are beyond all
training they don't need anything  in
Hindi 
""
Now that theory is no longer considered to be valid 
""
And  such
programme for higher civil servants and ministers  to Rajiv
Gandhi 
""
Though I must say  where I
was also the director we use to get  senior civil servants as well as even
ministers in those days 
""
But in recent times  in the whole gamut of public administration
this was started 
""
Now  the U G C has started it on the academic side the same who
is  you cannot be standard
""
Now our teachers are notorious  for
the whole 
""
What was given by Dhananjayrao Gadgil when I passed my M A  same
notes I go on using 
""
Now  such is the dynamism of
knowledge  what that what you said
yesterday does not hold good today 
""
A syllabus came in economics  and it said the socialistic
economic system  experience of Russia and East European countries
""
Now where is socialism ?
""
What kind of socialism are you talking of  ?
""
Things change so rapidly  in the realm of
knowledge but also in the external world 
""
And the objectives of programme such as this is  to constantly
 because we have
subject matter programmes  in respect of methodology which is also
important 
""
And thirdly the general environment in which you work 
""
University is considered to be an Ivory tower
""
Yes to an extent it is an Ivory tower 
""
But this Ivory tower of education  unconnected with
the  political environment
technological environment cultural environment in which we carry on our whole
process of education 
""
And therefore we ought to know this environment 
""
We cannot be frogs in the well  dealing only with a commerce
accountancy and the like
""
I mean 
""
And therefore this general programme of orientation  which
will tell you 
economics  within India and
without India 
""
I therefore hope that uh  will not be
considered by you an irrelevant 
""
What is this programme it is not in the syllabus of Botany  ?
""
This is not a question to be asked here 
""
We are not here concern with Botany or Zoology or Economics or
Commerce or Political Science or Education or Hindi or English in pursuing
""
""
We are concerned with these 
""
And I hope that uh  you will understand the importance of these
wider frame-work  it is
not  and
the student  now it has become reverse
""
The student feels that he knows everything  and the teacher
knows nothing 
""
This is the new approach  to education that seems to be
evolving in our country 
""
A student in Goa university got ten marks and he failed  and he
promptly writes me ten letters saying that the teachers don't know  uh
how to  and they have wrongly put me at ten and it is a
great injustice to me 
""
Now what do you do  ?
""
Therefore  approach
 for the enhancement and the upgradation of the capability of our teachers
""
But much will depend on the teachers themselves
""
How you participate  ?
""
What you get of the programme will depend 
how you 
""
If you come out  and your
experience  you will find that apart from
the expert  you will benefit more
by 
""
This will be your transformation  from a teacher you will
become a student  from an older person you will suddenly become a young
person 
""
This transformation I hope the programme will bring about 
""
It  it reduces your
age 
""
So if you are forty 
""
And that happens for a teacher also 
""
The teacher should not go on uh 
but uh  he must come out with all the energy of new knowledge and new
curiosity 
between human beings 
""
Communication between human beings is a very big process 
""
It changes 
""
It is not communication of one 
""
One becomes hundred in the process of communication 
""
So I hope all these processes  and as a
result of uh this programme  uh more uh delighted
refreshed  and would
not keep what you have taken to yourselves 
""
But would share it  with your
colleagues  and with the academic community of
which you are a part 
""
So in all this uh  process of education and its dessimination
""
""
I don't know whether what I have said amounts to any key note
address 
""
I had not uh prepared myself formally to deliever it  but uh
""
""
Once again  to the
Vice-chancellor  and provide the
forum for the conduct of the activities 
""
And I am grateful  providing the
co-ordination 
""
I thank them heartly on behalf of Goa university  and on behalf
of myself 
""
And I wish well  to the participants in the
programme and to the programme itself
""
Thank you very much
