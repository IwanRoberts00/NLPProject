What stupid

The Vice-chancellor of the university  or the teachers who teach
""
""
""
""
This is my definition  of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
contemporary problems 
""
""
power 
""
I  am very fond of constantly quoting the ideas of John Kenneth
""
""
your wealth depended on the number of slaves you can command 
""
""
than another with hundred slaves at his disposal 
""
""
thousand  a man who owns
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
over land in the second phase of history  over money in the third phase of
history
""
""
""
What is the measure of today  ?
""
The knowledge that you produce 
""
The knowledge that you apply 
""
""
""
Therefore  have to be successive from this
""
""
Now there is poverty of research in the Indian university 
""
""
""
new books are  some useless text-books are prepared and they
are the 
""
""
""
""
""
in money 
""
""
""
""
""
And why should we read it  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
By the  that I have diclosed in the last few
minutes you would have  that I am not such an ignorant
""
""
After all I was not an educationist  I was in the Indian
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in that particular field that is the mark and that is
""
""
""
""
""
my effort and that was my approach 
""
So  how do we continuously recharge the batteries
""
""
""
battery recharging process 
""
""
are a new person  and your personality changes and the students must say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is  this is the mark of success of a programme like I hope
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
an institution of process involved 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
training 
""
They believed in training on the job 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
came into existence
""
""
""
""
""
other 
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is the question Rajiv Gandhi asked 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now that theory is no longer considered to be valid 
""
""
programme for higher civil servants and ministers  to Rajiv
""
""
""
""
ministers in those days 
""
""
this was started 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What was given by Dhananjayrao Gadgil when I passed my M A  same
notes I go on using 
""
Now  such is the dynamism of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the objectives of programme such as this is  to constantly
""
subject matter programmes  in respect of methodology which is also
""
""
And thirdly the general environment in which you work 
""
""
""
""
""
""
the  political environment
""
""
""
""
""
We cannot be frogs in the well  dealing only with a commerce
""
""
I mean 
""
And therefore this general programme of orientation  which
""
economics  within India and
without India 
""
I therefore hope that uh  will not be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I hope that uh  you will understand the importance of these
""
not  and
""
""
The student feels that he knows everything  and the teacher
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
great injustice to me 
""
Now what do you do  ?
""
Therefore  approach
""
""
But much will depend on the teachers themselves
""
""
""
What you get of the programme will depend 
""
""
If you come out  and your
experience  you will find that apart from
""
""
""
""
become a student  from an older person you will suddenly become a young
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
curiosity 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
One becomes hundred in the process of communication 
""
So I hope all these processes  and as a
""
refreshed  and would
""
""
But would share it  with your
""
""
""
""
""
""
I don't know whether what I have said amounts to any key note
""
""
""
""
""
Once again  to the
""
forum for the conduct of the activities 
""
And I am grateful  providing the
""
""
I thank them heartly on behalf of Goa university  and on behalf
""
""
And I wish well  to the participants in the
programme and to the programme itself
""
Thank you very much
