 laugh thank you very much carly   uhm i could probably talk to you for two hours without stopping about what's going on at the cegep collège d'enseignement général et professionel   uh what i would like to do is give you some general information  and please jump if you have any questions i think the simplest thing is just jump in if you have a question something's not clear what are you talking about or someone told me that is that really true  uhh please the information in here is for you so uh uh  word what you want to know about  maybe just very quickly to to step back before august of this uh present school year to what the cegep was before the reform hit and certainly knocked e s l english as a second language  requirements out of all recognition  uhm roughly before that we probably had about ten percent of the student population taking english courses   more in montreal uhh less in the uh outlying regions  that was roughly the clientele  some programs had english as uh a compulsory course  uh for example language programs  computer science had ahh an english that was compulsory   uhm office management technology had several english courses uh business english courses compulsory  uh and a certain amount of that some of it depended on  provincial coordination programs  others local cegeps could decide okay we're going to put english into this program  uhm aside from that i think maybe seventy-five percent of the students took english as an elective  so they were there because they'd they'd  chosen they wanted to be  uh with the reform we now have a hundred percent of the student body in english courses  uh whether they like it or not they're there and they have to pass two courses before they get their their  diploma   some teachers felt that uh this would create a a what division excitement whatever in the classroom uhh but from what i've heard i haven't heard very many if any negative comments that these students don't want to take english courses  uh they may have trouble with the w  what's expected of them but there's certainly no big beef that gee we don't think we should have to learn english  so that that's one view that has not in fact materialized   another bit of background is what the course  courses were before  there was a description about ten lines long uh half a page wide that described what the course was  uh in addition in what was called the cahier de  word mots g&eacute;n&eacute;ral uhh  there was sort of a profile of the student at the end of these two courses will be able to blah blah blah and the rest  some teachers were aware of what was in it  other teachers weren't  uh it was a fairly wide open field  not to say that the job wasn't well done but it was shall we say open to interpretation   with the reform there are more definite standards  uhm how well they're adhered to we'll find out in a couple of years once the proverbial dust settles  uh and to give you an idea of what student now do uh students in their compulsory courses have what are called sound of chalk on a blackboard uh cours de formation  g&eacute;n&eacute;rale   which means in other words you have to do it commune  uhh  hang on i'll go back here  propre and compl&eacute;mentaire  sound of chalk on a blackboard ends   so it's in this block where students have to do a certain number of courses  in the the  compl&eacute;mentaire there are uh three french courses there are at the moment two philosophy courses two phys ed courses and one english course that all students take and they're mixed up  and no matter what program they're in they end up in one of these courses  okay   ah one new thing with the reform the first two french courses are four hours instead of three hours  so some hours were added to french although it remained  at at at four courses  uh philosophy lost a course  at the moment the minister is looking into putting an hour into the first course   uh and at the moment phys ed is at two courses although there is a  possibility it may go back up to three  an there's one english course   then the ministry created what's called cours propre    uhh try to find the definition   uhh sorry there ain't one  uhm the ministry doesn't really  well the ministry sort of has one  uhm i what i have dubbed them   chalk sound begins and ends   i've been have fun with making up acronyms of things  i've called they're not e s p they're e s s p english for sort of a specific purpose uh because  they don't they're not addressed to a program  laugh group response   it's not english for computer science english for nursing english for business administration  it's english for a group of families that the cegep has put together   okay  uh so that's this  in english it's it makes it makes   certainly more sense or it's more obvious than in other courses  so if they had an chalk sound starts english french  and philosophy chalk sound stops course called une cours propre   okay  the other terminology that you may hear also referred to is   chalk sound starts block a block b chalk sound stops  uh a lot of different terms were were   bandied about at the beginning and some of them have stayed even though there is an official term   kay okay   so no matter what program they're in they're all mixed up  it sort of depends on timetables  they take a course in english in the block a the  formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale commune and then they have a  une cours prop uh and each cegep decides how the families will be put together   okay  and the other element of the formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale is cours compl&eacute;mentaire  and those are the electives  and with the reform since english has now moved into the  compulsory courses students cannot take english as an elective   okay  so students must take two english courses in their regular program but they it's not an optional course anymore  the the electives are divided into five or six families uhm which i don't remember uh but there are things like uh technology and science uhh human science uhh art that sort of thing uhh and modern languages  but with the reform the distinction made is that english is  la langue seconde in francophone cegeps and french and anglophone cegeps and langues modernes is anything excepting english and french   okay  and langues modernes fall under the electives  so if it's spanish or german or italian or hebrew or whatever else it happens to be russian or yiddish those are electives and those  are there but english cannot be chosen as an elective by the student since they automatically have two courses to pass   am i going too fast or if it's not clear give me a holler  question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   for example in uhh there's a new program coming in uh our cegep uh hotel management technology   for example they have two courses in their in this  block formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale commune et propre  plus the the other element is   chalk starts what's called formation sp&eacute;cifique and that's all their core programs  chalk stops   whispered response   so for the hotel people it's uhh uhm i don't know what their courses are uh but in the in the computer science program for example they have programming this programming that and all the rest of it and if there's an english course in there then it  it's obligatory it's not by choice   okay  and in the hotel management in addition to their two courses they have three other english courses that are under cours sp&eacute;cifique question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   i don't know if they're going to change the word cegep to   i don't know cepet or something   laugh   but it's now uh what we call pre-universit&eacute; et technique instead of g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et professionel   response   that's another bit of technol of terminology   terminology has changed  so what was called professionel which in english translates vocational and not professional in fact uh is now become technical and what was general is now pre-university  pre-universit&eacute;   so those are the two  so whether whatever program they're in they have to do this and this   response   and in the cours compl&eacute;mentaire at the moment it's three courses but if philosophy gains an hour if phys ed gains another course the comp the electives go from three down to two question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker  uhm i'll give you the codes for the levels  uhh the new course levels uhm are this chalk starts and stops   there are in fact five levels  uh unfortunately with the reform codes they've decided codes don't mean anything and don't have to mean anything and they don't mean anything   uhh for example one oh four happens to be lower than one oh one  okay   uh so there are five levels   there there's a reason for it although it's not that logical and it may it may change  uh the ministry first gave a mandate to the writing committee saying okay we would like two english courses one for sort of the  sort of the hoi polloi that have sort of done something and that's that and ones who are really advanced and we said that really won't work because there's a big gap in the middle and there's maybe something underneath that too  uhh so they said well just make us two courses and we'll see  so we we wrote out two courses keeping a bunch of things in the back of our mind noting there was a hole in the middle and we kept those things to fill in the hole  so the ministry then says oh my goodness yes you're right we need three courses  so we came up so they came up with  uh the request for three courses  three courses were created one oh one one oh two one oh three  uh and then below this level we said there are a lot of students that aren't up to the level of one oh one we need another course or we're going to have fifty percent of the students doing make-up courses that won't count for their for their diploma  uh and they said oh my goodness i guess you're right again so we'll create another course and we have to call it something so the next number is one oh four and in fact it's lower than one oh one   okay  so the jargon is this is ensemble un ensemble deux ensemble trois for the moment this is called ensemble transitoire   it may not be as transitoire as they thought  and this is called word &agrave;  word chalk starts and stops   okay   uh and as you mentioned johnny when the students arrive at the cegep uh they are tested by whatever tools people are using  the perfect or imperfect as they are they are in fact tested  and then students are streamed into one of these four levels or if they're very weak uh will be s put into a word  &agrave; word for which they  there's a very fine distinction in french uh le cours accr&eacute;diter n'est pas comptabiliser   so they get a credit for it but it doesn't count   okay  the reason they get a credit for it is so that the cegep has the money to pay the teachers who teach it uh but they can't count it for  their their dip their cegep diploma   question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   some cegeps take the placement test and say okay you're below this level you do the word &agrave;  word other cegeps give them a choice hey you think you can handle the one oh four try it if you fail well take it again   uhh some of the cegeps said oh we don't have time to do this we'll just put them all there sink or swim  what's the difference whether they if they   do this and this or this twice  uh and they're one of the effects  of the reform is that the local cegeps have more autonomy than they've had in the past and there're a lot of decisions that local cegeps can make  and if you talk to your friends and you get sorta  sort of five different answers that's quite possible if they're from five different cegeps  each administration does have a certain amount of latitude  question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   uh our policy is that the s the teachers have three weeks to do something  either the student comes and says uh it's too easy it's too hard or the teacher realizes uh that there's a student here and that they understand everything and all the jokes so uh they don't really belong here because those students shouldn't understand a lot
