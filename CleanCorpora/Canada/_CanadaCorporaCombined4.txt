times   okay we have a couple of things we have to look at okay  words better we have to plan a  calendar over the next couple of  months   mm hmm  mm hmm  cos there's ah there's a lot of things on our plate  uh huh  uhm there's uhm there's uh  a vacation  mm hmm  and we're pretty much deciding we're gonna  going to do that with the last two weeks in july right  mm hmm  ah we have to figure out what day exactly we fly out  what's the day words july   before we discuss that i'd like to sc   discuss the stairs  stairs now  yeah intake of breath   if the kids are going you know to be get  be in day camp the first two weeks of vacation i'm still thinking maybe you could if you wanna want to do this work  is it their vacation  yeah  word   in june   the last week of june and the first week of july  the last week of june you words   mm hmm   word said it was word  yah  june  okay we i think the last day of the week is a thursday right  thursday or friday yeah  so uh thursday's june twenty - ninth june thirtieth is the friday  ahh so we two weeks after that is when the kids okay the kids are in day camp   that week already  so   yeah   yeah  and day camp they got one more week after that  and that's when you think we should do the stairs  yeah   uhmm so what you want me to take a week off of work and do the stairs is that the idea  yeah   okay cos what i what i thought we could do with the stairs is try to spread it out o over a couple of weekends   i'd rather not spread it out over several weekends  i'd rather we get it done  shit laugh   laugh   i don't wanna want to spread it over weekends  i wanted you to words   i mean word i mean   sigh   i really don't  either hire somebody to do it or else we do it in one shot  and we hire somebody to work with you   a helper  sh   anyway i'm not sure  i mean i the trouble is that   the s the stairs okay the problem is  the long room upstairs  mm hmm  and i think the priority should actually be to get the  long room done before we touch the stairs   the reason being that we're definitely having the floor sanded in the kitchen  mm hmm  uhmm  in august  uhmm yeah  do that august  and we definitely want to have the dining room  done at the same time  mm hmm  if the stairs for whatever reason can't be done by then then keep it in mind that the stairs probably won't be a uh uh se se separate issue  okay they can be done before we can do them after  because we're not gonna going to be sanding them at the same time  there are <?several word we're  gonna going to do ourselves  a few words sanding the kitchen  floor   words sand it  mm   yeah   uh huh   and uuuuh we're seeking perfection words  yeah it's good i uhn  sentence   yeah  okay but the stairs  okay but but   when we do the stairs and we tear up the stairs and do all the work on it why do we want k kids roaming round the house   sentence   why don't we use that week   are you afraid the kids are gonna going to  word or fall down the stairs or  something   it's gonna going to  be a mess  it's gonna going to be a mess   what mess is that  cos it's a little dusty work  okay  and it's it's the kinda  kind of work where you you have to  words tear out the carpets  mm hmm   okay   and you have to scrape all the glue off the stairs  mm hmm   and the a sharpened scraper will only you can actually do a pretty clean job scraping that glue off okay   why do you have to scrape to take the uh glue off if we're  gonna going to get rid of that wood anyway   ah my assumption is that we're not gonna  going to do the whole thing in one week  okay i mean we can do it in one week and do the  word laundry room in that week and we'll have to   ladder ladder walk up and down the stairs during that week okay   so i dunno don't know how many  steps we'll get done how many days it's gonna going to  take us to to do the entire staircase okay  basically i think that you for you know over two or three days  you're gonna going to have half  half of your new staircase in place while the other half of your staircase is still ah still there  yeah i hope so   if you're gonna going to scrub the glue off and get all the glue off and then we're gonna  going to be throwing that stuff away then why should take the glue  i understand it's not such a good job getting all the glue off  if y if you sharpen the scraper quite a bit it comes off quite quite   uh cleanly  i guess my my idea is really first get rid of all the carpet glue all the dirty stuff  then we've got these bare wooden stairs here   and then what you do is like i said it's probably gonna  going to be over a few weekends  like that first weekend we'd do maybe the bottom two stairs or the bottom half of it   and the following weekend we'd do maybe aah the next six steps  and the weekend after words we'd have  the other six steps  and then   can't we take a week each  take a week  i mean the weekends were gonna going to  be when we do something else   i could take maybe a couple of extra days off  okay  i don't think i'm gonna going to take  a whole week off  okay i i don't think i have  words   i got four weeks of vacation okay this year  mm hmm  i don't feel like giving up a whole week of my vacation  to uhm do up our house   clause with  taking the carpet off word   that's exactly what i'm saying  that's exactly what it is that i'm saying   that is what you're saying   i'm say i'm saying that  we do as much as we can of it  what doe the little things  that you know ahh you can get out of the way  you get that done with in your spare w   spare time in the weekends  mm hmm  okay  and then when you're ready for the big part of the job okay   re replacing the actual steps and all that and carpentry okay  that even that okay words  you wouldn't wanna want to spread it over you know too many weekends that i could do it in and it could take  i could do that in two long weekends  okay i could take maybe a monday off two weeks in a row  i'll take a monday off and a friday off  words the weekends in july or when do you think you're gonna going to do this   uh i could do it maybe i could do it in june or uh  so take the long weekend th that week that  th in july when they're in camp   you know  er i i just think if they're   gonna going to be in camp then we should probably use that time as much loud tumbling noises to end of utterances  as possible to get stuff done  sigh   whispers to a about their children ask him if he wants some  well then i spose suppose uhm   i i yeah  if you wanna want to do it that week we can do it that week  what i'm saying is that if we get started before  i mean then we'll get stuck in and we can do the carpet and at least get that out of the way  and uh words   sentence uhm yeah we'll do that  words what you wanna want to  do words the kids words   okay   kay okay   okay so so what do we have here   a hamper  sigh   i i'm wanna want to try and size up exactly what's involved okay  i mean when i s once i start   taking these carpets off then i can take a closer look at what shape  the stairs are in how much work is involved okay   how capable i am of doing it myself  okay once i can do that i'll have a better idea   nn and how capable i am of doing it myself okay  i might to be able to do it myself and uhhh   if i run into like more like technical difficulties okay things that uh ah i just don't have the experience or the knowledge to know how to solve the problem maybe i'll uh ask marcel  words   words done he can come over and gimme  give me some advice uh for around fifty bucks an hour we'll do that okay  but uh i don't really think okay that i need a helper for the physical part of the work okay   it's the kind you wanna want to   do one step at a time and words one step at a time okay  it's not something where you can have one guy doing word  the stairs and the other one guy going down the stairs  okay   okay okay  sentence   i haven't even got to tell you that i've  word those stairs over the railings you know  y- you do them one step at a time   one stair at a time  sigh okay   okay  so  so then our goal is to get that outa out of  the way by first week in july is that it  yeah   before we go on vacation  okay   yeah   okay have you looked into this vacation business in a while  no sigh   i saw the number i'm gonna going to   have to call the number   i dunno don't know
