 john keenan is the founder of the home run foundation which is co-ordinating the programme  he joins me now  good morning mister uh keenan   good morning  now how uh would this programme work how would you get kids out to the ball game  well uhm the key is publicity i mean uh we believe that uh  with the help of the media we'll get quite a few out uhn large numbers uh  we're going after the corporations to buy blocks of seats uhn large number of blocks of seats uh for our kids charities and our underprivileged stu organizations that are in and around montreal so we're very confident that with media support uh corporations will uh will donate heavily  what kind of incentives are you giving to the companies  to to try to buy these blocks of tickets  well again publicity uh widespread exposure the uh  the stadium scoreboard will offer publicity uh radio tv newspapers  okay   do they get a tax write-off  absolutely they will absolutely uhm  any any uh organization any non-profit organization can can get a uh tax receipt  so as long as uh th the organization that they're buying the ticket for is non-profit they will get a tax receipt  okay   okay uhm i it occurs to me that uhm that if if if you know this is  these are hard times for the expos that this is a way of shoring up their good fortunes i spose suppose  laugh   uh no doubt about that but uh we're you know we're looking at this from a different angle actually  okay that's not your concern  cos one of the things that i would wonder is whether when  when certainly in mid-week games the expos have uh plenty of seats open uh whether you might approach the team for them to donate uh tickets for various organizations as well  uh absolutely  they have agreed uh they already have a plan set up where uh any charitable organization that buys a ticket is donated a couple of dollars uh from the expos x   mmm   so they do receive uh a couple of dollars so the expos are doing already quite a lot in that regard they have been for years and uh and they have their their own foundation set up  through bronfman charity foundation that uh issues tickets to  kids' organizations so what we're doing is a little different in that we're a asking corporations to buy seats so it's more revenue generating  and what s what stage are uh are things at right now  have you got companies on board at this point  uh at the moment it's word of mouth uh my own contacts that i have uh  there are a lot of uhm people out there volunteers and so on that that are spreading the word around  but we hope that the uhm th the  widespread publicity that we hope to generate anyway will  will get the word out and our message and our concept out to the corporations  have you uh got special co-operation from the team as well when you mentioned the business of of flashing things up on the board uhm it it suggests that you've got the team on board for this  yes i do uh expo owner claude brochu uh responded very favourably uh to it and uh he's given me uh his full support in that uh you know for your for publicity uh in the score  scoreboard on the scoreboard and uh as well  there are there are uh media logos that uh could be used for upcoming promotions and special events uh maybe not this year but certainly next year and we are looking to get it started this year at least uh  sort of a dry run test pilot this year to see what kinds of  objections we come up with but it's full-fledged we hope to have it in operation full-fledged next y-  next season   mmm   okay what brought you to this project  are you just a big baseball fan or what was your interest in doing this  well uhm i was having a haircut one day actually and i asked the hairdresser if uh he was a baseball fan and his answer was that he really didn't care much for it didn't really understand it all that much uh the game was too slow for him et cetera he probably would never go to a game  but what was strange is he still has a very vivid and fond memory of the great time he had as a as a   boy scout when he went uh to an expos game with a group of uh other boy scouts  and they all brought their gloves and they sat in the furthest seats and he still talks about that and he goes that was the time of my life   so that was when i started to realize that you know this game is uh is very much uh a kid's game and we should remember that  as a kid mmm   and do you would you have certain charitable organizations that you that you've  already linked up with or non-profit organizations or or  how would you tap into those those kids  who who could benefit from going to a baseball game  well uhm we uh we hope to approach uhm a couple of uh  we're we're specifically looking at the underprivileged youth here in montreal so we'll probably go after ah ah some of the bigger names that that everyone knows them  but wh star teens for example  but we haven't approached anybody yet we are right now at the stage of uh of getting the media to get on board  star teens   well we've done our bit laugh   yes you have and thank you very much  okay s well good luck with this it's  certainly a very uh noble effort on your part  thanks   i appreciate it  thank you for giving us uh the airtime  no sweat  i i've been speaking with  john keenan he's coordinator of take me out to the ball game  and that's a programme that hopes to get  or aims to get underprivileged kids out to see the expos   well no one wants to think about dying but preparing for that eventually ah eventuality i should say  certainly saves a family and friends a lot of confusion and frustration  people who prepare a proper will tend to minimize the conflicts that can arise after their death and sometimes split up families  joining me now to talk about what people should know before writing a will is georges arnaud   he's a lawyer who specializes in estate tax planning  good morning  good morning  now i i think for most of us  particularly if we're young we're thinking that this is something way off on the horizon  um at what point should we consider writing up a will  well i think the first thing to do is to uh make a global inventory of the assets that you might leave after death   because today as the law is working in taxes uh with the estate   is uh is the following french speaker   they would take for granted that the day before your death you would have sold all of your assets  that is called the deemed disposition  and it's the uh it's the sanction from the income tax law  it's both for federal and provincial tax law  so what you have to take into consideration is the kind of assets that you are leaving   ah if i could take the example of the r s ps retirement savings plan for example uhm the r s p would be ah would be  deemed to be disposed of which means that it's like if today you were withdrawing all of your word   gee  so what it means is that this would be considered as a salary and it would be added to all other incomes during the same year  so if someone leaves like i don't know like for example an hundred thousand dollars speaker doesn't say 'one' of r s ps or pension plan or both ah that would be considered as being income plus what what has been earned during the same year  so word   and   so you're saying that even if someone's young  they may they may have more of an estate than they think of because we're not thinking about things like r s ps   yeah sure  i mean uh you could have like uh pension or sometimes you know people would be uh would be uh leaving a company and would have some kind of compensation and that could be roll-overed  not " rolled over" into the r s ps  mmm  so it it brings a lot of money at the end  so that that could be taxable at least at fifty percent  so meaning that's fifty thousand dollars goes to the government and the other portion to whoever is concerned  unless you have prop proper  provision in your will for that like   th th   now how just how proper do you have to be in drawing up a will  i mean you hear of people making sort of scribbled notes on paper  uhm what sort of document is considered a will   well any written document uh draft by the person itself  like i if you   you have like three kind of will that could be uh drafted  you have the autographed will which is a will that could be drafted by the person  you don't need any witnesses for that  it has to be dated and signed and all with the handwriting of the person  and then i spose suppose you should let somebody know that you've done this  well it's preferable because otherwise it could be lost or it could be thrown away and nobody would know  so that's the difficulty with that kind of will  the other two kinds of will that you can have is the ah notorial will which is well-known in quebec   but it's only for quebec  you draw it up with a notary then  that's right  and the other uh the other kind of will would be uh drafted and acknowledged by two witnesses  this is the england form of will  which is the uh most frequent in all of the provinces and even in the states  hmm  uh that's actually the the kind of will that we are drafting with the with the  lawyers here   >ah word okay     now i i know that lately i did up a will because i i now have young children and so even if i don't consider myself a weathly person laugh   wealthy person i wanted to uhm look after their care and maintenance  i spose suppose that's another aspect that people m they wanna want to consider  you're not just talking about what you want done with your goods after you leave but also perhaps the care of your children  yeah exactly  you see uh not only do you have to ah to know  what kind of assets that you have but you also have to know  what kind of protection you wanna want to leave for the beneficiaries  if i take the example uh of your your  children for example   you could have like a trust created in your will so that the money will be administered till they reach a certain age under which they should receive all of the assets or a portion of the assets  uh you have two aspects in it   you have a protection against themselves and you also have a protection in term of access also  so you have like two benefits to create that kind of uh  of trust that word   you say protecting against themselves making sure they  won't don't burn through all their money  by between age eighteen and twenty sort of  thing   exactly yeah sure   okay   uhm what are the kinds of things that people often forget  to consi to to look at  when drawing up a will  well mostly it's the it's to  consider the uhm the kind of taxes that they would have because they don't know the specificities  in in term of taxes  hmm   whether there's a difference if you leave it to your spouse or your children for example hmm     that's right   okay because sometimes you wanna want to   leave a portion to x and a portion to y but it might be preferable to go by a certain way or give certain specific assets to a certain person because that would be tax free and the in the  other case it wouldn't be   so you have to think about that
