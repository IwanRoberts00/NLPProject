 he lands low and touches the ice but he manages to keep to stay on one foot there   and this was the second double axle that they tried and this one was much nicer  very nice unison on that   natasha was the youngest competitor last year in halifax at age thirteen   both her parents are skaters  her father a former japanese national champion  and here are the first set of marks   five fives for the most part a five four from the japanese judge up to five sevens for kuchiki and sand of the united states  now the artistic impressions and you can hear their coach  congratulating them  there they are five fives five sixes sevens and a five four again from the japanese judge   so right now kuchiki and sand of the united states are the leaders   they ensure themselves of at least a fourth place finish  still ahead brasseur and eisler's main rivals the european champions mishkutenok and dmitriev when we return to munich and the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships tv advertisements   welcome back to munich and here are the main challengers for brasseur and eisler  the european champions natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev  if you saw our show from sofia you know their long program is a beautiful one  it is and you're gonna going to see a real contrast in styles between this program and lloyd and isabelle's  this is elegant and beautiful whereas lloyd and isabelle's will be powerful and dynamic   and they open with two gorgeous side-by-side triple toe loops  and a beautiful triple twist  it doesn't quite have the height of lloyd and isabelle's but it was beautiful nonetheless   and here's the throw triple toe   this is a very good opening for them   barb what really impresses me with this team is that there's never a dead spot  every step every arm movement flows into the next  it's like perpetual motion  it's just beautiful to watch it flow across the ice   nice   they are on tonight   chris you had the opportunity to watch this team at european's  i sense tonight a much more aggressive pair of skaters out there as though they really want this title   paul although they won the european's with their long program there was a mistake in sofia but this has been virtually flawless  as you can see natalia has unbelievable flexibility and th they're able to come up with some really interesting moves because of that flexibility   they're already getting on their feet here in munich   an absolutely outstanding performance  this crowd is on its feet   they have come to skate tonight and they've put on a show  that is gonna going to have to be topped by isabelle and lloyd by one of at least equal calibre and determination  i don't know about you but that ending just gave me the chills  it was just beautiful  natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev perhaps the loudest ovation we've heard so far   the whole look was just fabulous  the skaters it almost looked like they could feel each string as it was played by the orchestra  they just worked it for all they had in them   apparently they don't give out standing ovations in the soviet union but this pair earned one at the national championships this year  well the long program carries the most weight so the pressure will be on brasseur and eisler  here's a look at their double axles   very nice   marks for technical merit   a five seven from the japanese judge the rest are five eights and the crowd is unhappy   well they have to remember that the current leaders are yet to skate so they have judges have to leave themselves some room at the top if they r skate well enough to be awarded first place marks   here are the second set of marks  they have to leave room  they have but not much  look at those five nines  lloyd   lloyd and isabelle will have to put on the performance of their life this evening to beat this performance  the soviets have certainly put the pressure on brasseur and eisler  the canadians skate in quest of their first world title when we return to munich after this tv advertisements pre-recorded segment on brasseur and eisler   well here they are   an unlikely union a couple of years ago as their coach josee picard explained last night   isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler skating for their first world title but they know the task at hand  well i think they know that thore they're  going to need to perform a very clean performance this evening   she just gave him a big smile as if this is gonna   going to be a piece of cake   look on this side-by-side double axles   and they nailed them   great   barb i thought that was as great an opening as any pair we've seen here tonight   an absolutely gorgeous one arm press star lift   and of all the men skating here watch lloyd eisler's feet  he has by far the cleanest feet of any man skating in this competition   one more very difficult element the throw triple salchow   beautiful   they're one minute away   barb i don't know about you but i think i can remember the feelings that they're feeling right now   laugh   i don't think they could have possibly skated any better this evening   there were moments out there where they just knew they were on they knew it was gonna going to be a happening and they put it down  this building has exploded   it's in the judges hands now but that looked like a gold medal skate  as that program went along i felt they got more confident skated stronger and just put on a absolutely outstanding performance  probably the best of their lives   well lloyd's dad has just continued the tradition of sending the hat out onto the ice   number one ranked coming in and we'll find out if that's the way they leave   here's a look at the side-by-side double axles   a crucial mo   paul i can't believe we missed this  lloyd did a single axle  barb i don't know about you but i'm always so busy watching isabelle do her jumps cos she's the one who usually has the  difficulty with them   well i i'm sure that everyone in this arena was watching isabelle including us   now i don't know if this is gonna going to  make the difference in this program or not but   here we're looking at a split triple twist  nice height on this twist but i i  just can't believe we missed that element   well there's not much room for error because mishkutenok and dmitriev were virtually perfect  and they were also very strong on their individual jumps  so this could mean the difference  you can hear the marks being announced and there they are  the first set five sevens five eights and one five nine from the polish judge   this is going to be very close and i'm not sure they have enough  the artistic marks should be higher   here they are   two five nines the rest are five sevens and five eights  it's not enough  chris you're right there just i isn't enough marks there to put them into first place  i mean i don't think that they could've skated any better  they did an absolutely excellent performance aside from that axle  but i guess maybe that was the difference  well isabelle not showing any disappointment on her face   oh you wonder about lloyd's bad knee  he will undergo surgery in june to repair the ligaments in his left knee  that hockey mishap in the holidays over christmas   it's rather stunning because they ignited this building only to finish second  we'll be back with the medal presentations after this tv advertisements   welcome back to the olympiahalle in munich for the medal presentation for the pairs competition  it was not gold for isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler of canada  for the seventh consecutive year a soviet pair has won the  world championship  what a performance by natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev as they edge out brasseur and eisler for the gold medal  and a surprise bronze medal performance by the americans  natasha kuchiki and todd sand  olaf poulsen the president of the international skating union  presenting the gold medals to mishkutenok and dmitriev   interesting that isabelle as soon as she got off the ice and heard the marks she said well we'll get them in albertville   she can take some consolation  her teammates in boucherville stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier did a wonderful job in their first world championships placing eighth  christine hough and doug ladret the other canadian pair placed eleventh   but this day belonged to the soviets natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev they are the world champions for nineteen ninety-one   it's tied at two  so far neither side has been able to score more than a single point  b c getting singles on the first and fifth end  the second end was blank  new brunswick with single points on the third and fourth ends  once again here's colleen interview with julie sutton   julie sutton of british columbia and heidi hanlon of new brunswick all even after five ends of play  elaine jackson the fifth member and coach of the b c team talking with the rink   and ellen brennan in a similar role with the new brunswick champions   well very shortly we'll see whether the strategy pays off in the second half of this game  the score after five is two two  you are watching the scott tournament of hearts live on sports weekend tv advertisements   well don duguid through five ends of play here at saskatchewan place in this scott tournament of hearts final anything  you've seen that might cause you to think that one side or the other has a bit of an edge  well no it's very very close don but uh you heard hei  uh heidi hanlon say uh you know i always play better in the back part of the game  uh she's curling about eighty-eight percent now and if she gets any better than that it's gonna going to  be very difficult for julie sutton  laugh   well julie sutton as we heard in her conversation with elaine jackson indicated that she was going to try and play that centre guard game  well i think she's gonna going to  have to you know  she struggled with her draw weight a bit but the last draw in the fifth end she put it right on the button and that's got to give her a lot of confidence so now that she's got her draw weight i think sh  you'll see her do a bit more gambling  do you think as this one gets down to the closing ends that experience may be an advantage  i really think so you know  this is very tricky ice but uh the big thing and it's  gonna going to come down to last rock i think and it depends who has last rock in the tenth end  well it's all tied at two after five ends of play  colleen  well the ice is working well for a little bit of a come-around game so teams are going to be able to start taking chances  just eavesdropping to the team meetings a little bit we heard julie saying we're going to play a tight guard   she doesn't want it too far out there because that's gonna  going to give new brunswick the opportunity to come in and around  we also heard heidi and her team saying we're great second half players   even though they played well these first five ends they even think they can play better  they also like the fact that they haven't allowed julie and company to play that wide open kind of a game   well new brunswick has the edge in team percentage  they are curling at eighty-three percent as opposed to seventy-four percent for british columbia   we talked earlier about the differences in the brooms the women are using   we talked about the design of the broom that the  sweepers for b c use  that's an al carlson design   the husband of pat sanders who was a provincial and world curling champion a few years ago  and with that bend in the broom don it is a little easier on the wrist and the women are able to get more pressure on the brushing hand
