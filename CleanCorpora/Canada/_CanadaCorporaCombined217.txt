 along with my husband who did exactly the same thing i did only he doesn't have a theatre because like it was word  but  three words like really ridiculously insane  laugh   i mean it's all so ridiculous   why should   someone comments   uhm so we went we went straight up and we hiked through the uh the word  uhm went through the wonderful three or four words  laugh   what do you wanna want to do   and where do you wanna want to go  and we impressed everybody on the very first day by telling them that we wanted to go to killiniq   on the top right right smack on the tip of  ungava bay  cos we looked at the map and we thought ohh that is so cool  it's like right in the middle of nowhere  right in the middle of all this water around  and everybody roared with laughter because killiniq doesn't really exist laughs with audience   it's on the map but nobody lives there  there's no village there's nothing it's just a dot on a map so  i think we impressed everybody by wanting to go to the dot on the map laugh   so instead they sent us to nearly the smallest community that we have because yeah  and they sent us to tasiujaq which is right here on uhm uhm  on ungava bay  guess you don't   you guys should know your geography well enough to know that this is ungava bay this is hudson bay  and uh tasiujaq is the second little village uh like a hundred and twenty people   pretty small guys  really really really small laugh   uhm and we were there for one year and at the end of that year uhm word people village and it's the largest inuit village that uhm is in quebec that's well in northern quebec basically  uhm kuujjuaq is bigger over here  it's the sort of big uhm administrative centre and everything and you'll see it in the news every so often  if you ever see anything to do with northern quebec nine out of ten it's either kuujjuaq or you will have heard of great whale  two words because of the hydro project  that's where they've chosen to do the hydro project   so that's sometimes in the news as well  uh kuujjuaq is bigger than inukjuak it's got a thousand seven hundred people roughly but it's pretty much uhm it's not really divided three ways it's almost fifty-fifty white or southern southerner however  w w we call white people even if we're not white kind of in the north like   we had a jamaican teacher who thought it was the funniest thing to be called a white person all the time four or five words  be called a white man laughs with audience   he thought that was great  uh but that's how they refer to us so  audience member comments possibly a cough   uhm and there're uh quite a few white french canadians english canadians working there living there  so the school is actually not fifty-fifty but a lot of the students there english is their mother tongue  as opposed to inuktitut where word it's not the kids and three words   so that's where that's where we were and what we uh   we were both teaching  i was uh for the first year i taught grades five six seven split george taught all of secondary uhm  laugh   and he was principal for the year laugh   uhm and then when we moved over to inukjuak we were spoiled  that's why we only two or three words cos you have pretty much single level classes and i taught grade six and grade seven so  we spent uhm two years indoctrinating the word  and the women laugh thinking   cos they go from me to him  worked really well  it was really nice  uhm uhm now he's he's still up there this year teaching grade seven but i think it's his last year   little wonders in grade seven   grade seven well now you're all sort of saying starts speaking very softly grade seven that's gonna going to  be real hard two words grade seven stops speaking very softly   we do two words we need clientele and that they're all ninety point nine percent inuit children and so their mother tongue is inuktitut   and when they come to us they come to english in grade three   uhm and then they start all their content they do all their content subjects in english  they still have inuktitut uhm  i think that out here they have it everyday word   but it's slowly sort of filters down to about three times a week   and they have culture class which is usually a morning or an afternoon every week where they're that's in inuktitut   and the girls sew and the guys hunt audible breath   uhm laughs with audience   audience member asks a question   they probably wouldn't take choice  i mean they do th there's  sometimes like the girls will go out fishing and stuff and like they will do things together but they probably wouldn't also pick either option  the girls will prefer to do that  audience member starts to ask a question   audience member asks a question   no no and every year  now uhm some of the things i say are also village-peculiar  but most most villages all villages have some sort of budget to go on well not big trips like outdoor trips  and when we were in inukjuak every year we went out uhm in the spring   either with the older kids on a camping trip and the younger kids would go for a day fishing trip  so you'd go with everybody and and and and   word village they've got it's  muttering   it's great fun  that was a lot of fun  and then i went camping that's with the second group  could be seventh grade   and so yeah you can join in  you generally what happens  at one during those well the three periods of culture a week that are nice big word   the last thing you really wanna want to  do is go out of town and all week and this is   your your your kinda kind of   time that you have to do other things but  but if you wanted to join in and wanted to go down and see what they're doing that wouldn't be a problem except that they are doing  three words so uhm sometimes  like all the culture teachers are elders in the village and they speak no english so maybe they understand a bit but they  they couldn't tell you what you're doing basically  so if you've got a lower grade you have to rely on your kids to tell you what they're doing  it can be a bit difficult but  audience member comments   but yeah you know i mean we're welcome t   to join in and find out about what's going on cough in audience   so in terms of pedagogical things we we're not  really teaching we are teaching a second language but we are teaching everything in a second language   so from a pedagogical standpoint it it's  not really e s l  we always come up with an appropriate name  i call it word e s l and everybody has a different term for it  like right now the board trying to come up with a good political term to use word   uhm so that means that should  and if you apply to be hired laugh   you'll have to teach math and science and well depending on what uhm grade levels you're looking at  in primary you teach math science social studies english uhm  art noise of uncertainty you can teach  well that all depends  some people really think that's a great idea and then people freak  laugh   uh you you may in one o   if you're in a small village be asked to teach gym as well  but that's not so bad  and that's that's basically what all you teach  in secondary it breaks down to science becomes things like ecology  uhm social studies gets sort of broken down into history geography but they're lumped in together  uhm there are there is physics and chemistry but most of the time they're the board's  leaning to uh hiring specialists to do the math and physics and chemistry cos that's just specialized  i mean that was my one thing when i i   remember being here it's if i have to teach secondary math science and physics put me in primary  and that's how i ended up in grade six cos mm mm algebra   never thought about that you know laugh   it's one of those things that once i thought about it i went mm mm i won't do that  but some people are comfortable with it and then you'd probably go to a smaller village where they don't have a specialist  but most villages are are  gettin getting a math science specialist who gets to teach math and science noise from audience   uhm and and and in senga  those people are often not e s l specialists so they often have more difficulty that you can in adapting to uh   like it's easier for us to pick up i find it's easier for tesl people to pick up a book on on  uh ecology and and or biology or something like that and read it and figure out what it is we have to do and know how to teach a lesson on it than it is for a biology person to think that oh my god how is someone who doesn't speak my language  gonna going to learn this  they don't have the the ingrained drummed into your head techniques that we all have  and so often the tesl specialists are in quite a few words a lot of content people who'll be asked to be your assistants   does happen  uhm when things break down i i i  thought oh i'll have quite a few words little teeny piece of chalk here  okay  i sat there everyday and i never even looked at this myself  in the primary sector we have   oh don't worry you'll never get this laugh so  i'll just i'll say it out loud  uhm in we have four hundred and sixty-five students in inuktitut so that's basically grade five to grade three grade two  we have this is a new word this is a sudden change five hundred and sixty-eight students study french and we have  four hundred and fifty students studying english  that's the first time to my knowledge to my knowledge that that balance shifted  normally it's either fif it has been  fifty fifty or more on the english side so  hmm laugh i wonder what that means  and in secondary we just have english and french no more inuktitut  well they're still learning inuktitut like they have inuktitut   class language class every week uhm or couple times a week  that's this is more like uhm  seventy-eight  and for kindergarten this is a funny one cos there's one village kuujjuaq and kuujjuaq likes to be different uhm that has a sort of experiment going on   and they start  where are my numbers  where did they go  oh there they are  start from there  they start uhm french loud feedback type noise on tape  in kindergarten  and it's the only village and they have all the cree students  laugh   so two hundred and sixteen little lovely ones in uhm kindergarten  so y i don't know if you're getting a vision of how many little kids there are running around this place but there are a few of them  so all in all there are two hundred two thousand five hundred and seventy students in the north from a population of seven thousand people  that's about forty percent of the population  inukjuak my old village uh one of the years that we were there there was a statscan statistics canada thing that came out  and and it it had the highest birth rate per capita in canada laugh   there were almost more babies than there were adults at one point  laugh   there was a baby born every week that whole year  uhm and if not more than one  there's at least one child born a week laugh   whistle in audience   three words baby showers  laugh   uhm so and you can tell they're like three words  keeps coming up in the system  and in inukjuak over the few years that i was there we started off in my first year we had forty kids going into kindergarten   by the time i left there were three kindergartens of of uhm four kindergartens of twenty kids each   so laugh there laugh potential for jobs   comin coming up in the near future   but it also it's a very uhm big social problem that's gonna going to be happening because all of these kids are going to get older and older and they're   gonna going to hit secondary and then they're  gonna going to graduate or whatever and what are they   gonna going to do   there's this big population boom that's coming up  you know but these two thousand uhm five hundred odd students what are they gonna going to do  there aren't very many jobs you know  audience member asks a question   very few come south  it's still   it's still not   well in the bigger communities it is a priority they want their students to come down to cegep
