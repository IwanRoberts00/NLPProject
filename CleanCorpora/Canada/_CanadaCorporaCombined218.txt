 their children come down  and smaller communities they're still not actively encouraged to come  and in some places they're still kind of discouraged to leave  cos they don't want them to leave  cos the theory is that if they go they won't come back or if they do come back they're not going to be word   it depends on how they come back  if they come back after a year depressed and demoralized cos they couldn't stand it   which is highly likely  you're coming from a village of a hundred and twenty people and you come to this laugh you know like  this is a big shock  uhm then then they come back to the village and th and they don't know what to do with themselves  they don't know how to fit in cos they know that they don't fit  there's nothing for them to do anyway and and and  they've gone to the south and they've failed or it hasn't gone overly well so what do they do  or if they come back here and they do well they get jobs down here  you know especially if it's in something that isn't uhh a direct service  like if they you know they if someone  goes and studies art history there's not a whole lot of museums to go get a job as a curator at laugh anyway  so whaddya what do you do  you know like you can go work there's a uhm  uhm a cultural institute there  we have  someone comments   laugh but it's a museum and there have been archaeological digs in the north and they found uhm uhh a lot of very interesting artifacts  and that is something that is coming up and it would be nice to have inuit doing those excavations as opposed to southern archaeologists coming up   certainly they'll have more uh more  involvement in it but other than that i mean how if you go into archaeology and you're inuit will you  the likelihood of you working in the north is pretty slim so  you know you could become a lawyer or a doctor or something that's something that could be useful to your community in three words  but there are very very few  it hasn't there haven't been that many graduates from university yet  it's just starting  the schoolboard is only uhm  i dunno don't know   seventeen   seventeen years old  yeah no couldn't be  eighteen now eighteen years old  and before that there were day schools federal day schools  and in but in most cases they were sent to residential schools  now it doesn't  everybody kind of cringes whenever we say that too cos it's oh my god residential schools  they've just seen all those c b c movies  uhm for the most part i haven't heard any horror stories of things  it doesn't seem that they had the same problems that a lot of the indian children seem to have had at residential schools  that's not to say it didn't happen  i'm sure there are cases of of of abuse and things that happened   but per se like the people i've talked to who're the  roughly people my age people in their thirties and forties they went to residential school and very few of them have bad experiences apart from feeling lonely and and very far away from home and losing a lot of the cultural contact like all those  the traditional things that would have been taught to them as young people in the community  they lost that  they weren't there when that happened uhm so  so they they come back to the communities and they integrate in their own ways and there's cer  there is a certain displacement of knowledge at a certain level  th th there's a lot of things the elders know that nobody else knows anymore because they weren't around   and it's not necessarily two words these guys  laugh   the two thousand laugh because a culture class can only do so much  and unfortunately uhm it's not always uhh organized as it could be  and it's often communities don't have there won't be anyone to teach for instance boys culture  hunters are hunting and there's no one who's gonna  going to come in and teach so uhm  th th they want to keep up the traditions on one hand but on the other hand it's really hard to find people who are are willing to come and work in the school and do that uhm  so the people you get are usually very good if they do but they don't often stay very long  that's another thing is they're not they don't they don't have they don't have our i don't know protestant work ethic is the only term i can think of laugh   their their lives up until forty years ago were lives of survival  they weren't living in houses they weren't working they were surviving  they were hunting and fishing and and  moving around wherever the hunting was good  and they were completely nomadic  there's uhm one of my friends in inukjuak she's i guess now she must be over forty-two but at the time i remember she had just turned forty and she she was the last person in the village that was born out on the land uhm so  but i mean to me it was fascinating that there was someone still around that was born on the land you know that's a weird concept to me to born out   and when they mean on the land they mean literally whoops here's some moss this looks like a good spot laughs with audience you know  this was on the land  and they two words i think it was winter i can't remember wh how two or three words   so they still have people who have very interesting memories of living  a lot of them still remember a time before houses the time before central heating the time before running water the time before stores  and and and uh and becoming used to convenience foods  two words chuckwagon  it's this disgusting sandwich thing that you stick it in the microwave to heat up  if you ask your students what did you have for lunch ninety percent of them will say chuckwagon  took me a long time to find out what chuckwagon sob  sniff   wasn't anything i ever  you know you kind of expect peanut butter sandwich or something  no chuckwagon   if anything  uhm and still a lot of their their what is it uhm living or their word   the children are allowed to do what uhh as they please pretty much  if they want to stay up till three in the morning on a school night they do  and it's not that they're not looked after really it's just that they're treated in a different way and it's up to the child to go to bed when he's tired and eat when he's hungry kind of thing  so that there may not even be formal meal times  which when you start implementing a regimented school system where they have to be there at nine o'clock in the morning and they can't they're not supposed to sleep in and they should've had breakfast before they came and all these things that we'd expect from them   expect them to be relatively rested and fed so that they can concentrate   it's not really fair  and it's it's one of those things that  y you can't really go in and say well this is what we demand   word   but then you kinda kind of have to try to explain that well if they did that then they would do better in school  so it's a it's a draw   and and th  there're a lot of parents now that that   are have gone through enough of the school system to know what is ex what we expect what we have  our preconceived notions of what school should be when we go out there  so there's a difference between older parents and younger parents  there is  sometimes it's not uhm necessarily a favourable difference  like theoretically you can think that oh well a parent who's gone through either the federal system or the residential school well they know what school's about so they should be more sympathetic or more   you know where it is laugh   more uhh uhm able to help their child  six or seven words aside i'll just stick it there for now uhm  but that's not always the case sometimes sometimes  they have had bad experiences and they tend to think that their idea of school is is not a good one uhm   but sometimes the older parents uh they  they understand that there is a value to school they don't understand how the system works necessarily they don't necessarily  they're not really able to help in any way but  no most certainly the likelihood of any parent being able to help with homework is very very very unlikely that you'll find parents  that that can do that  or or are willing to do that cos they don't necessarily know that it's something that would be good to do  aside, talking about something in the room let's just throw that on the floor audience laughs   uhm uhh and a lot of the time you'll find that  you have children have very old parents  report card day comes and the parents come and meet you  and and you think is this that woman's child  laugh   it's just not biologically possible  uhm adoption is a very different thing in the north  for one y if if it's between northern families they don't go through the whole legal nightmare that everyone seems to have to go through down here  they often will adopt uhm like i if  if a girl gets pregnant   a teenage girl gets pregnant   it's not considered a problem  it's not considered something bad or something stigmatic  there's nothing stigmatic about it  if she decides to keep the baby that's fine  if she decides it really she doesn't  feel she wants to be bothered about it the mother will adopt it  or or the grandmother might or another family in the village  i it usually keeps within family the the child will stay in the family but sometimes the they'll be adopted to another family or  so that's where you get these women or mo mm these parents who are definitely grandparent age you know laugh if not great-grandparent age who have these like really young children  so it's kind of an interesting thing  it certainly makes for interesting translation of report card  it definitely two or three words and try and explain what social studies are laugh   it's very exciting laugh   report cards are a lot of fun  in the smaller communities you go around to the houses and you visit and that's just great that's uhh  you really get to know people  even in the big communities  com kuujjuaq is a little different but in inukjuak where i w i can honestly say i don't know everybody in the village and i've lived there three years  you still get to know families of your chi of your children and you know  sometimes you don't wanna want to know what the household situation is like sometimes it's not a good situation but you're aware of it and so you can react accordingly  you know that there's something been going on the family or that the parents drink or whatever so you know that the reason little bobby is going berserk on you is   there are reasons  it's not just cos he's being a pain in the butt today  audience member asks a question   it's a difficult thing  uhm a lot of the time we're we're  viewed as people who are coming to give them a service to do something and they really appreciate that we're coming to do that but getting involved in their personal problems is something else   if well obviously if you think a child is being abused you can't just sit back and not do something about it  i mean as a teacher as as a professional you cannot just yeah  s uh s as a human being but also as a teacher you have a legal obligation to  to try and do something  so you have to go through the sort of proper channels of the principal and  in every school there's a principal and uh what's called a centre director who is uhm always an inuit person uh word uhm  they are like the li a liaison  with the community  they're an administrator within the school but their primary function is to make sure everything runs smoothly with the community so the community understands what's going on  so they would be like really the most appropriate person to see and you would approach them and talk to them about the situation  and they will also know more  they will more likely know more about the situation than you do anyway so they will know the family they will know of anything that has been done in the past
