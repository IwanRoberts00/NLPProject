criticism of parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois  government plans to increase the sales tax from six and a half percent to seven and a half percent next july  government officials say a billion dollar cut in federal revenues makes the increase essential  but the liberal finance critic doesn't buy that  jennifer bronstader reports  andre bourbeau says he's not surprised the p q parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois government is going ahead with the increase suggested in last may's budget  but he's still disappointed  it's typical of ah of the  parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois who ah who  imina of jacques parizeau who in the past has always chosen this route of uh raising income tax and ta  and taxes   instead of uhm ahh you know working hard at uh reducing government expenses  he says the government knew the cuts in federal transfer payments were coming just as other provinces did but other provinces have managed to balance their budgets  he also pointed out that he was able to reduce the p s t  provincial sales tax from eight percent to six and a half percent during the short time he was finance minister and he says the current government could do the same if it got down to the business of reducing the amount spent on salaries for civil servants  but bourbeau says the sovereigntist government has backed itself into a corner  this government has has ah fought the referendum having as its major ally the c s m the suc the syndica  the uh f&eacute;d&eacute;ration des syndicats nationaux  though  the uh the unions that represents all government employees  uh most of them anyway  so they're they are in a trap there because their major ally was the union and the union is the one now that they have to bargain with  bourbeau says the p q government probably picked now to confirm the increase to spare the parti's new leader from assuming responsibility for it  mister bouchard will probably if he ever comes will probably say well this was done prior me uhh and uhh it's not my responsibility  it was uh it is the past  bourbeau says the announcement seems to be part of premier parizeau's housecleaning before he leaves at the end of december  jennifer
