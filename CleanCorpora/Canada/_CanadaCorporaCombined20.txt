on a saturday   no no usually it was like uh  it was like well it was more like a like   if if we set aside a day it was like from  a soon as i could get there to or as soon as she could get to ottawa to like i don't know eight or nine hours we'd spend  oh  first time actually was kind of surprising  we spent like hmm fifteen hours  we spent four hours talking beside the uhh lake ontario  it was like then i look at my watch and it was like eight thirty p m and i was like holy cow laugh   where did the time go  oh man   that was that was like alert alert   cool  but it was kind of like the first time you know both nervous as hell and kind of giddy  ya   and that's why i sang all the way back to ottawa and  laugh lost my voice laugh   laugh   pathetic laugh but you know   laugh   man i'm
