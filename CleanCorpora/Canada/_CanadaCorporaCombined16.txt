good  four four people a day at fifty dollars each that's two hundred dollars times ah puff  five  that's a thousand dollars a week  yup  that's pretty darn good  she must have a a large clientele   mhhm  if she's i mean does she have her own house does she live word in her own place ya     oh ya ya ya ya   i think she's hungarian   that stuff gets funny i don't want to to  stereotype but the gypsy thing you know  mhhm  something you'd identify with with hungarians and fortune telling   it's nice   ya   that's funny today cos i was telling her about c  well actually yesterday when i phoned

sing you are you  you're articulate and so on and so forth but your singing  uh-un  everybody else has told me everyone else has told me that i cook i sing well   laugh   do you think you sing well  i think i sing better than you do  no  oh yes  oh no  yes  oh no   yes   uh-un  no i'm sorry i don't think i sing better than you do but i think i have a better voice than you do   that's different  no  yup  no   well you have a better speaking voice ya  no not necassarily a better speaking voice  ya you have a better speaking voice  you're more clearer but that's because you were in communications and stuff like that  it doesn't have anything to do with communications  sure it does  no  oh come on when you know you're being recorded and you're on the air you don't talk differently  i do when i'm on that s  that hand radio thing  oh i see   hand radio  or ham  laugh laugh   laugh   easter ham radio laugh   laugh hand radio   smoked ham radio   it's like when i was a kid i used to call this my  thingger laugh   what   my thingger   laugh   your your finger and your thumb   laugh   laugh my word   laugh that's funny  ya  this is funny ha  haaa i have to go and pick a bath mat and then i have to buy some  word soups and then i have to buy a baguette  like a baguette  baguette laugh   you sound like some kind of swamp frog  baguette baguette  don't you know those frogs that sounds like they sound like when you hear a tin can it's half full of water with a lock  bahuuu bahuuu  mhhm   that's what i used to think   you do that well huberto   that's what i used to think when i was young eh  laugh   i'd think it was somebody throwing  hitting hitting a can with a rock   a can of water bahuuu   oh ya   god  it's nice you know i used to wonder  wha how how do you do that how do you produce that sound bahuuu bahuuu bahuuu    laugh laugh laugh  oh god   it's true bahuuu bahuuu   ya ya ya anyways so my fortune teller's sound of coin hitting the ground see why do you interrupt me   i just dropped some money  ya no i wouldn't interrupt you   anyways we're going to be very happy together as long as i don't lose my temper so quickly  she said because i'm very changeable my temperament is very changeable  it's volatile  and i can fly off the handle for no reason whatsoever  ya but i've never seen you really really   give your observations on that photograph that you took  and then you can give the observations on the one i took of you  alright let's start with amanda then  do you want me to start  yes   i think it's an incredibly beautiful photograph of a  girl just on the threshold of womanhood sitting in a   a strange overgrown rock garden wearing a   a wreath of dandelions and she's so innocent and so beautiful and so unfolding  and what i'm going to do with this is i'm going to get an eight by ten blown up and use it and write a little story about it for   that this little half-book that i'm working on  right right does she remind you a lot of chloe there  no not in the least absolutely  i know she's more impor  important> i don't know really she's she   doesn't resemble any other family member that i know   she doesn't resemble chloe in the least   i always thought she did  so what do you think of my photograph word  i love it that's why i'm getting the triptych made and uhm it's it's gonna going to   look great  and uhh i still like the idea that it looks as though i'm falling  that i haven't hit the ground  i don't quite know why that optical illusion happens but it does although it took me a day to to see that  that uh that's i suppose is a little bit of a disturbing image the idea of still falling  but the body language in the photo i've i   look very relaxed i think  words i just mention that uh in fact i showed it to the psychoanalyst yesterday that photograph and said  that i didn't have the technical skills to photograph myself lying face down in a field of dandelions and cut grass   but i should point the fact that it's it's   symbolic it's myself   it's what it is it's the fall of icarus flying too close to the sun and becoming unglued and   and that's my life   i tried to fly too close to the sun and became unglued   came unglued laugh laugh    ya that's it you read it you read it
