 but in fact it hasn't been done all that often besides ah danielle martineau  and i think she's doing something that's ah really quite unique  thanks very much samuel   thanks boyle   just to recap john hiatt performs at the spectrum tonight danielle martineau at caf&eacute; campus on friday and saturday   thanks very much matt   five minutes now before nine  it's been a long week for bob gay   laugh   i think he's starting today for the first time   starting to show the signs of strain   what are you talking about  you look a little tired   just a bit tired   i look tired   do i sound tired i hope not  no no   good   right now though let's talk about the newspapers again  with jenny goode   hi jenny   hi johnny   ryan welbeck in la presse quebec newspaper today writes about richard leille the uh former minister of restructuring who's ah been out of the cabinet since just after the referendum  and he says i mean there's this whole scandal now because there is uh a lot of questions  the quebec auditor says there had to be a further investigation into how contracts were handed out because they all seemed to have gone to richard leille's deputy minister a and then he handed them out to some other people he knew  well ryan welbeck in la presse says that  jacques parizeau the premier ah deliberately picked leille as minister of restructuring because he was incompetent and if the whole thing was a failure then leille could just be uhh the scapegoat for it and it could all be wrapped up and thrown away  uhh bill savage in le devoir quebec newspaper says well why don't we just wait for the results of this investigation that the auditor is proposing before we condemn anybody  uhh roderick wagner in la presse uhh also  wr writes about writes today in  la presse writes about the quebec auditor's report and he says uhh he's writing about the underground economy  uhh the auditor had said there's two point seven billion dollars worth of underground economy that's not being taxed  now that this is like a collective theft  that the people who are not paying those taxes are robbing from the people who do  because they're robbing from the system   mhm   they're not putting any money in  and he says uhh wagner says  look it isn't when you talk about underground black market economy you're not about uhh drugs and contraband cigarettes  you're talking about   laugh guys in sharp suits   laugh exactly   he says you're talking about legitimate activity construction  babysitting all this  it's just that it it isn't being taxed  so he says what you have to do is find a way to encourage the people to pay taxes but you don't want to squelch that activity because it is valuable within society  right   so he says that's the del delicate  balancing act you have to perform  cough   of course he doesn't laugh say how  how </}you can do it and it it's   not really easy to figure out  yeah   on the opinion page of le dev   le devoir la presse   sorry uhh is lucien bouchard's speech to uhh  yesterday which was i think to the chamber of commerce in laval  yeah that's right yeah   and is basically about uhh budget cutting and the financial responsibilities quebec is going to have to take  and what tack he's going to take as ahh premier if nobody challenges for him for the leadership  so if you want to look at what he said instead of just reading news reports that's in la presse   in the gazette local newspaper uhh the editorial board writes about this a crackdown needed on tax cheats  the same thing about this ah underground economy not being taxed  and says that cheating on taxes is very frustrating because it means the people who do pay taxes have to pay that much more for every time somebody else cheats  and this gets even more people frustrated and then they want to cheat  the gazette says look we've got new technology we've got computers that can allow us to check up on what people claim they are being paid and uh compare it with what they actually received and who paid them what  and we can also check on how much their house is worth  you know if they are living in a house that's worth ten times their annual salary something's up  le journal's quebec newspaper michael olderlay writes about lucien bouchard taking responsibility for ahh quebec's finances ahh and saying that he he will cut  he says it it's  refreshing to hear somebody not blaming the last  premier and saying well i can't do anything the budget's pretty much already determined  mhhm   yup   and also not blaming ottawa  just saying you know we we have to live with our own uhm sys system   situation   the globe and mail canadian newspaper this morning has an interesting story  remember jean chr&eacute;tien right after the referendum complaining that the he didn't like to go to sleep at night after listening to the french c b c's canadian broadcasting corporation coverage  saying that it was biased in favour of a yes side  well an outside consulting firm has examined the uhh french c b c referendum's coverage  arran research incorporate says that while the yes side did get more airtime on the french network that reflected the news developments of the campaign and there was no evidence of bias or misrepresentation in the coverage  so that's the globe on ahh apparently uhh quite fine coverage by radio canada during the referendum campaign  thanks very much jenny   jenny goode with the newspapers this morning here on daybreak   five minutes now before eight and here's john white   i'm still trying to get used to the colorado avalanche symbol next to patrick roy and mike keane's name  and i think roy is also gonna going to  try and get used to it a little bit  he said earlier this year when the uniforms first came out for the avalanche that he hated them  laugh   took a different feel uh yesterday when asked about it    laugh word   i said to bob this this morning   it would be funny to ah wear a new jersey in my first game in ah  and also uhh the first game on february the fifteen when  uh the fifth sorry i'll i don't know if i'm going to play but to be on the bench or if i'm on the ice ah seeing the montreal jersey on the other side and if ah   not be really concentrate in the game uh almost go on the wrong bench and ask some gatorade to pierre joval instead talk to my trainer  ah you know  it's it'll be something really uhh uh really new for me  i also heard him say that he was going to have to really concentrate  he figured the first time he played the canadiens   you know to remember those guys with the c on their jerseys  weren't weren't friends   exactly   that's what he was saying right there uh  they will play the avalanche uh february fifth and it will be at the montreal forum  the circus though has left town boyle   finally all these reporters who had never covered the  canadiens before who showed up uh  for the last few days of events   ugh   do i detect some resentment there laugh    laugh   no not at all   laugh   it's just i i it  i it   everybody in the control room is saying yes yes yes   laugh   laugh   that's not fair laugh   that's not true laugh   it's just that they're dividing around the country  it's still the same amount of people covering  it's just some people are going to colorado today for the avalanche's game against the edmonton oilers tonight  uh already la presse and le journal  and the gazette three quebec newspapers have writers going there  there'll be more people who go up to ottawa on saturday night  the avalanche will be just up the road in the nation's capital for that game  and then you know some people will be in pittsburgh where the  canadiens play tonight  and then back here uhh on saturday for a big party again  laugh   a reunion in fact when the canadiens  play the rangers  and you get to stay in montreal  i do   laugh   i absolutely do   laugh we're glad   relax we're we're happy to have you   here   yeah thank you  it would be nice to send to denver  we'd like to have that live report   laugh   sucking sound no   laugh   there's uh been serious economic fallout from all of this  we talked about the the money that the canadiens are saving from all this  but what about all the fans who spend so much money on buying number thirty-three jerseys with the red white and blue it  scripted broadcast talk   colorado avalanche colours  speaking for thousands of moms everywhere i'm sure  my son's abandoned them  really  boston  whew   he says boston  canadiens to boston  hey  blaspheme laugh   laugh no   thanks very much john   tape begins mid-sentence uh hm a long time ago with the alouettes but it just doesn't seem like its a big football town  well since the alouettes have left here in nineteeen eighty-six and they brought in the montreal machine and the world league of american football  that did well  but so has uh junior football in this province  they're starting to develop some good players  and all you have to do is look down to the united states and the university of michigan and tim biakabatuka  who played at vanier college and grew up in montreal even though he wasn't born here  so there are a lot of ah good developmental schools now in this area that though although have to send their better players to the united states where they have a better system for them to progress to the pros  but at least there's interest here now  thank's very much john   doug goren is here with traffic   tape starts mid-word bout  about those logbooks  it's it's really i find it quite astounding because those books the ones you have in front of you are fakes  they're there to fool the government  these aren't uh legal logbooks  these are doctored-up logbooks  wha what what do you mean  uh they've been uhm tampered with  well you've taken off hours  yeah  i've uh rearranged the logbooks so it looks uh legal when you go through uh weigh scales  why because you were driving more than ten hours in a row sometimes  yeah there's times that drive forty hours uh without any sleep  no stopping  no s no s no eight hours no four hours  nope laugh no there's no eight hours no four hours  its now twenty-six minutes past twelve o'clock  you're listening to radio noon  my name is mary henny   what do sign-making and chicken farming have in common  not all that much actually  unless you happen to live at tullochgorum farm  that is near ormstown in the chateauguay valley  radio noon's duane johnson visited the farm recently and he is here to tell us more about  hello duane   hello mar mary   what is the connection  laugh well i laugh   now if you tell me no connection at all   mary what a stupid question  you said it  laugh   laugh   the connection actually is is  suzette ann gaston   uh she and her husband jeff have been running a chicken farm near ormstown for several years  they call it tullochgorum farm becuase it is on tullochgorum road which is actually uh actually right next door to where john hershey lives  uhm which i found out only you know sort of round about   i approached it from a different direction  i didn't realize that although we have been to his place before  uhm well much as as suzette ann gaston loves chicken farming and her little chickens uh she wanted to branch out at a few years ago  to use her own fine arts training in something okay  she had been through concordia and lawrence co  college lawrence saint lawrence college   and well a few years ago she started making signs for people  farm signs uh store signs that kind of thing
