 case's onocendi console that's a brand name and the novel is littered with brand names is a kind of prosthetic extension of his mind which allows him to transcend his body and interface with a higher reality  as the novel opens case is pursuing a path of self-destruction  caught holding back on a client his nervous system has been sabotaged so that he can no longer enter the matrix that is so dear to him  though it does not effect him otherwise the nerve damage consigns the cowboy to a kind of death in life  he's like the cowboy who can't shoot his gun anymore  he refers to this postmatrix life of his as the fall a corruption which like atoms leaves him in quote the prison of his own flesh at the mercy of quote the meat and all it wants a real disdain for the physical form and  and what it needs to de uh to survive    the computer prosthesis effaces the body relegates it to an archaic and vulnerable support system which requires an unfortunate amount of maintenance  for homo datum biology is no longer the determining factor in destiny but the hardware attached to it  upon case's regaining the ability to enter the matrix the reader is told this was it   quote continues   the prosthetic supplement is not just the means of access to the transcendental realm of cyberspace but the apparatus of its domination   the matrix is the new frontier of the postindustrial psyche a terrain so vast as to never exhaust the imperialist qua  capitalist desire for expansion and exploitation  the relationship between case the console cowboy and the space which is the proving ground of his identity is a remarkably accurate remapping of the politics of domination so evident in the imperialist enterprise  though as hollinger claims neuromancer in many ways aligns the structural oppositions that have supported the phallocentric project of capital the text also encodes a disturbing desire to witness the male subject mastering a threateningly feminine nature which is at once greater and lesser than he   the transition from the world of meat our physical forms to that of cyberspace the word that is used to describe this is  jacking in   one jacks in to the matrix  the act is thus explicitly sexual  the term derives from hardware installation which a male plug or jack is inserted into a female receptacle  it also carries with it particularly in light of the solitary and rhapsodic nature of the act connotations of masturbation  jacking off is a euphemism for  masturbation   the descriptions of case moving through cyberspace consistently display attitudes of male aggression  the console cowboy triggers sequences uses viable programs to bore holes in heights of secure databases and most commonly punches through the colour-coded spheres of information  particularly he punches  spends most of his time punching things i guess from punching a keyboard   the matrix is described as a quote non-space a term resonant with echoes of freud's description of female sexuality as lacuna as a dark continent a non-space of lack and absence  the principle site of male gender panic however is displaced from cyberspace to the prosthetically enhanced woman molly   or rather cyberspace is displaced is a displacement of male anxiety surrounding molly to cyberspace   molly is a razor girl  she's a hired muscle that plies her trade with the aid of uh a mirrored visor grafted into her skull through which she can receive uh information from computer chips implanted in the nervous system  she has these kinds of sunglasses that on the inside of she can receive information  uhm her body has been uhm prosthetically enhanced so that her nervous system is jacked up so that she can respond very quickly to things  more importantly though and more menacing molly's had scalpel blades surgically inserted under her red painted fingernails  a further displacement this time of the teeth of the  vagina dentata the archetypal image of male castration anxiety  the threat molly represents to the male characters is aptly summed up by one who warns another she'd have you wearing your balls for a bowtie if you looked at her cross-eyed   another character peter riviera who is capable of projecting holographic images  he has computer implants which allow him to project three dimensional projections of his imagination   he performs a cabaret piece in which a phantasmal version of himself is shown constructing an idealized molly out of thin air  the performance concludes with the phantom molly extracting her razorblades and ripping her creator apparent  the full significance of riviera's holographic vignette does not become fully apparent until much later in the book when molly perhaps fearing death uncharacteristically reveals something of her past to case  and now it gets very odd  molly was a meat puppet audience laughter a kind of  pros prostitute   this is what molly was  a meat puppet a kind of prostitute who has a computer chip  chip implanted in her nervous system which allows her to dissociate herself from what's going on  essentially the she can throws a switch in her mind and she sort of literally jacks out of her body which then proceeds to go through the actions with whatever her clientele is and then when the act is all over she can come back into her consciousness   molly uses the money earned as a meat puppet to fund the expensive surgery required to outfit her as a razor girl  so she's working as a prostitute to come up with the money  for this uh these new glasses and stuff  however her boss uncovers her subterfuge and has quote   some s some customer software cooked up  he essentially reprograms her body in order to take advantage of her special physical characteristics  her boss figures well she's got these scalpel blades  i've got some pretty klin kinky  clientele that might get off on that  perhaps i can take advantage of this   i never knew who wrote the program they switched me to  says molly but it was based on all the classics   she thus becomes an expression not only of male financial exploitation of women but an entirely male literary tradition of pornography  but the classics that molly refers to can only be the works of de sade and masoch  one night the cut-out chip that shields her conscious mind fails and molly discovers herself in the middle of a routine with a customer  this is not for the squeamish  quote   the implication being that they were it was   a threesome and what the senator wanted was for her to dismember  this the other woman in this in this   m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois   at the end of it when molly jacks back in when her microchip fails and she realizes what she's done she she similarly probably dismembers the senator  quote   molly becomes a complexly overdetermined character of male anxiety  cough more than just the fear concomitant with the figure of the independent autonomous assertive woman she represents the erosion of male power as the return of the repressed  riviera's performance the one where he constructs her out of air and then she destroys him shows her as the product of male power  he literally constructs her  which will ultimately be do the undoing  of that power  she rips him apart  the seeds of its own destruction  molly's days as a meat puppet rewrites the gender panic she inspires as the just and final comeuppance of the exploitation of women in patriarchy  the readily apparent sexual anxiety which surrounds molly spills over into the already feminized realm of cyberspace dangerously destabilizing it as a proving ground of the new male power base  the relationship between the matrix and molly recalls the lack which the prosthetic device serves to disguise   when case first makes love with molly he experiences the act as a substitute for jacking in to the matrix   this is the passage  quote   this scene reverses the comforting male dominance of the act of jacking in  here the female receptacle has literally the upper hand as molly usurps the assertive role  significantly however molly's orgasm goes undescribed  the male dominated point of view seeks to deny to suppress and master the condition of lack lack of power lack of body to which the very fact of prosthesis attests  a body which requires supplementation is always already the site of loss  the narrative voice that is ensconced in case's subjectivity however can only see molly as impaling herself a description fraught with the male desire for mastery in the face of its painfully inferior position  the narrative finally displaces her entirely in the vastness of the space for which she only serves as a metaphor  subsumes her in otherness uh subsumes her otherness into the realm over which he as an ace console jackie has complete control  the effacement of difference sketched in this scene from early in the book reproduces a miniature of the narratological movement of the novel  outfitted with a sim simulation  stim stimulation rig a device implanted in molly's nervous system that allow case to interface with her through his computer  case literally uses her as his eyes so that she moves around through things and he can control her  well he can he can see through her  molly becomes an extension of case a further supplement he requires to bring off the event which is the central concern of the novel the integration of two artificial intelligences in cyberspace  even in this capacity as an extension of case molly fails  oedipus-like her visor is crushed and she is partially blinded by riviera  case himself must both rescue her and complete the job for which they are being paid  the artificial intelligences merge and subsume the otherness of cyberspace into a new figure of transcendental presence  but this universal change results in little more than return of the status quo  so what's the score case asks this being that was once an artificial intelligence  quote   things aren't different it responds  quote   i'm word   we are approaching the asyntotic limit of gender the point at which two lines two vectors of trajectory may approach one another without ever quite meeting for the asymptote is also the point of absolute resistance the horizon of irreducible difference  the figure of the cyborg the prosthetic subject is this limit  it at once announces the inevitable elision of gender in the information age and in return the trace of a new male desire to retain some vestiges of its hegemony to paste over the very conditions which are ushering its inevitable decline  the prosthetic supplement does not only as haraway asserts  scatter subjectivity freeing it from the ties to origin and essence  it also inscribes a terrifyingly feminine condition of lack which is gender panic   gibson's neuromancer as in much cyberpunk literature the cyber the cyborg emerges as the exemp  exemplar less as the exemplar of a non-aligned non-gendered subjectivity so much as the site of male resistance the condition of a new unified subjectivity which transcends the old dualisms of gender only in order to master them again  i would conclude with teresa de laurentis then that quote  if the deconstruction of gender inevitably effects its reconstruction the question is in which terms and in whose interest is the deed  reconstruction being affected   thank you applause question and answer   thanks very much alecia i for   that kind and generous introduction   one of the joys of teaching in this english department has always been the large number of fine writers that there have been here and when you came you added to that number and thank you for that introduction   it's a privilege to give this year's h d halter lectures on language  and i don't know whether this thing consists on making a   do nosedive for my neckline here laugh  perhaps if we move this a little further this way   uhm i don't usually offer to give talks but i wanted to give these because since i've retired from this place it is impossible for me to imagine what my writing life would have been like without that vital influence of h d halter   the details of uhm that influence will probably express themselves  in this in these talks as we go along but  i just wanted to put on the record for myself this fact of a great mind which i encountered here a great teacher and above all a superb reader  because it takes reading to make writing   since these uhm talks are rather personal i hope you won't object to that uhm  if you do you   i mean there's no one standing at the door keeping you here  uh i've cast them in the forms of of  rather long letters written to a writing colleague  and uhm i find it easier that way to to  imagine a listener rather than say a a large number of you whom i know personally but one never knows who shows up and who leaves
