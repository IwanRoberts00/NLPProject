 we're also gonna going to discuss the role of uh newspapers  we've been looking through the english press  the globe and mail national newspaper the uh  the gazette montreal newspaper uh column by gretta chambers uh the suburban montreal newspaper   the toronto star toronto newspaper had a very different play on st&eacute;phane dion today than did the gazette  how do you feel that the various newspapers are reflecting uh your opinion  there's a big story all over the uh suburban montreal newspaper  this week's uh suburban montreal newspaper about the rough treatment that daniel johnson got at a at a  meeting  and uh i wanted to bring up a specific issue about that  there was one participant who a member of the audience uh patrick rosatti who asked daniel johnson uh who told daniel johnson what you risk with distinct society is the rest of the country doesn't accept it and then the separatists have the excuse of saying we've been humiliated  and he brought up a fascinating point that i'd really forgotten about  he said for canada to entrench distinct society in the constitution  it has to be accepted by qu&eacute;bec  and of course the p q parti qu&eacute;becois government would not accept it so it's-> it's pointless  so it's very interesting the different plays  are you satisfied with the play of the various newspapers uh  which one do you read the gazette montreal newspaper the globe and mail national newspaper   how do you think they handled this national unity issue  do you feel they reflect the views of uh the community  seven three one seven eight eight three star six four nine nine is the number to call if you are a bell mobility subscriber  uh let's go to our first uh caller mick uh  good afternoon you're on c j a d montreal radio station   mick go ahead  uhm i was just wondering uh yesterday's uh senate appointment in alberta  they they the liberal government overrode the alberta senate election law  and i just wondered are if the liberal government given up tryna trying to push distinct society in alberta cos that is an incredible insult to those people  w'i well i don't know if they've given up  i think they they should give up  i mean it's quite clear the people of alberta and b c  british columbia aren't interested  and what i find ev even more fascinating and i w i was  reminded of it by this question asked by uh at  </} the meeting that daniel johnson uh was addressing that uh even if they convince could be 'convinced' b c british columbia and alberta i mean we wouldn't be dealing with the people of qu&eacute;bec the approval would have to come from the national assembly  and lucienne bouchard has s said   uh distinct society is too little too late  he's not interested in offers   so i think the rest of canada is starting to call their bluff  but all of this divisive debate   uh i agree with st&eacute;phane dion  it's very important that this be held in advance and we have guy bertrand to thank for this with guy bertrand to thank  for the uh for the fact that this is on the   the front burner  and as for your question caller i think that the federal government  is is starting to realize that uh there's no point  in pursuing distinct society  i mean i people in quebec ah many anglophones don't want it  they feel it would bad reflect very badly  on them  uhm the separatists don't want it  they think it's too little too late  the rest of canada doesn't want it because they feel it will give too much power to qu&eacute;bec  it sounds very much like charlottetown all over again  so i think they are are moving away from that and they're moving to plan b  they're moving towards being prepared for the referendum  and i think it's a refreshing change to see the federalist side speaking up and telling qu&eacute;beckers yes there is a cost to sovereignty  it is not a cake walk  it's not easy  and then the and uh as uh gretta chambers mentions in her editorial that this risks helping bouchard  if it does how come he's not in a better mood  he's in a lousy mood  he he's in a very lousy mood cos he has to be on the uh defensive  and when he was talking to me he almost admitted that sovereignty isn't helping the uh qu&eacute;bec economy on good morning america and he said uh  and his insults uh at jean chretien i think they're working too well either  he said that uh this is the quote he must wake up at night thinking that he'll be the prime minister of canada who couldn't prevent qu&eacute;bec democracy from transforming qu&eacute;bec from a province to a country   and uh i think it's bouchard's who's who's   waking up at night thinking he won't be able to trick enough lobsters into the pot  anyway thank you very much uh for calling between discussion patter, traffic report and commercials for 4 minutes 40 seconds  $a> good afternoon we're back  you're listening to the johnny stalmacher talk show on c j a d montreal radio station   earlier i mentioned an editorial by gretta chambers  she's not that impressed with the bertrand case  she calls it an alice in wonderland court case  uh uh i disagree i think he's brought up some very interesting points  and uh for the qu&eacute;bec government to argue that uh   what what referendum it's all uh hypothetical is nonsense because both parizeau and bouchard repeatedly said they'd use a fifty percent plus one vote in favour of sovereignty to trigger  separation  that's bertrand's argument  i think it makes sense  gretta chambers feels that it's an alice in wonderland court case  and she thinks that instead of concentrating on this court case the federal government would be uh better off trying to kill sovereignty with the kindess of a good for canada plan a before they bludgeon to death what goodwill they still retain in qu&eacute;bec  so gretta chambers feels that in order to for  the federal government to maintain any goodwill there should be more concessions to qu&eacute;bec  would you agree with that  give me a call uh seven three one seven eight eight three   would you agree with gretta chambers' uh approach  uh do you think the bertrand case is an alice in wonderland case and that the federal government would be better off trying to find uh ways to accommodate uh qu&eacute;bec  let's go to uh where do we go we'll go to anton   uh good afternoon you're on c j a d  hi  uhm i think uh what bouchard we've  gotta got to uh remember with lucienne bouchard   is  we cannot underestimate uh what he's done  in in light of all these good events  that he is still a very crafty politician and he still knows how to uh  you know uh play play on the events  like uh for instance johnny you're uh have said time and time again that if distinct society were pitched to him that he could use that as the mother of all humiliations  right  don't you think that he could use this guy bertrand case in the future as the pronounced heavily as 'thee' mother of all humiliations  no  a a abso absolutely not  because the arguments are if he's the one who decided to take part  this isn't a humiliation on the rest of canada and also this is coming he can't blame guy bertrand the rest of canada  guy bertrand's a founding member of the p q parti quebecois  yeah but couldn't couldn't   he say to the people of quebec that look they don't really respect us  i   well if he   couldn't he say that  well he who doe he says   first of all he says that anyway  he's gonna going to that no matter what you do so that we know that  that's his position  but he he can do all kinds of things but he can't blame guy bertrand and the uh federal government  guy bertrand's a qu&eacute;becker and he's a former sovereigntist  like i said he's one of the founders of the of the p q parti quebecois   i think that uh distinct society rejection uh would be what is what he needs  cos it is going to be rejected  i mean that's clear  and the federal government is ridiculous to attempt it because  what the the way they can get out of it is  they're saying why should we pursue something that's been turned down  in advance by the premier of qu&eacute;bec  so they should say as of today that's it  we tried to do it  there's no point in doing it because lucienne bouchard doesn't want it  i mean he lucienne bouchard stood up in the house of commons and voted against it  i agree  i agree but i i honestly believe that he could really uh this guy bertrand case is good news or this is for all federalists and canadians  i i see it also at the same time as  bouchard's political ammunition for the future   well the thing is you know you can always tell if it's working for bouchard or not if he's pleased about it  he's not pleased with guy bertrand  if he were pleased about it uh then then   i would uh worry  he ca like i said he can't   there's no way he can blame guy bertrand on the federalists  uh let's get back to the phones  we're talking about uh amongst other topics uh gretta  chambers' opinion that this is a an alice in wonderland uh court case and it's not an important court case and the federal government shouldn't have gotten involved in it  in all honesty she said neither should the qu&eacute;bec government  but she feels that we should go back to plan a  do you agree with that or disagree  uh we'll be back with more of your calls after we take this break commercials for approximately 2 minutes   good afternoon  we're back and we're discussing uh guy bertrand his court case and uh gretta chambers and your reaction to uh her column about uh the court case if you agree or disagree  we'll go to alan   good afternoon  congratulations johnny on your new job  thank you  i'm very i'm enjoying it  immensely  oh thank you very much  uh i i put gretta  chambers'   i've read a lot about her and i read your article in the gazette and everything but her she   i know she's intermarried whatever maybe fran√ßais  whatever  the point is she's another richard holden another david payne  fir fir first of all  hold it hold it  first of all she's not intermarried uh  she she's uh a widow  and even if she a few words and   and   a few words was french   no no he wasn't   but even if he was what does that have to   to do with it   no i mean she's not she's not coming out positive  like richard holden david payne   these people are forfeiting our rights okay as canadian citizens  nobody has the right to take my canadian citizenship from me  no you're right i think the betrand case is uh making a point of uh of saying that   exactly   fine example   you're doing a good job  okay  thank you very much  tha   it's true  i mean one of the things that guy bertrand's making the point of saying that he doesn't want uh the separatists to do anything that takes away the rights of canadians living in qu&eacute;bec  and nobody has brought up that issue uh before   let's go to lenny   good afternoon you're on c j a d  i agree a hundred percent with guy bertrand's case  i think i even think the defense that the uh the qu&eacute;bec government  put is putting on is rather stupid and it's  gonna going to backfire against them   he is now is going to ask to uh indemnify every uh qu&eacute;bec uh every federalist in qu&eacute;bec for a hundred thousand dollars  there's a possibility that he's gonna   going to call both parizeau he's thinking of calling both parizeau and uh and bouchard   to testify because they said it really is uh it's really  cough there's really they're really not threatening uh a new referendum  i know they're word telling    word i disagree  totally  a few words   they're basically saying that a fifty percent plus one is uh is okay for sovereignty uhm to american television that's what they're saying and then in court they're uh saying the the exact opposite i>  imagine somebody for instance saying  technically i'm for the yes or for the no but for such ridiculous reasons that everybody understands that  it's really making words   mm   but shouldn't they at least have the right the freedom of expression to express that opinion  absolutely   that that's what i'm saying  yup  on the one hand you shouldn't force ah parizeau and bouchard to spend their money on them but on the other hand it's totally legitimate in a democracy to prevent somebody from having a sp a   a say   so the best solution is to allow groups outside the umbrella committee to speak independently as long as the money is raised uh   in uhh within the limits  so the government's primary argument is that this is the only feasible method of keeping spending under control for a referendum campaign  well that too is of course uh highly disputable
