 the olympiahalle in munich germany site of the nineteen seventy-two summer games  back in seventy-two it was the velodrome this week transformed into a spectacular ice facility for these world championships  good evening everyone  welcome back to c b c's continuing coverage  our second night of primetime coverage and tonight should be special  the men get underway in their quest for gold and of course all eyes in canada will be on kurt browning  browning trying to win the gold medal at the world championships for the third year in a row  now remember in addition to browning there are two other men skating for canada in the singles in the original program tonight  they are elvis stojko from richmond hill ontario and browning's edmonton team mate michael slipchuk  no question though the focus tonight in our telecast is going to be the pairs' and the freeskating portion of that event  the reason is isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler are the leaders heading into tonight's free portion   should they win they will join a long and distinguished list of canadian pairs' champions frances dafoe and norris bowden barbara wagner and robert paul of course otto and maria jelinek their triumphant return to czechoslovakia and most recently in nineteen eighty-four in ottawa barbara underhill and paul martini  now speaking of barb and paul they are standing by right now with chris cuthbert  chris  brian we're looking forward to the performance of brasseur and eisler tonight but right now our focus is the men's original program  it seems that so many great champions have had great challengers to push them and that's the case for kurt browning being pushed by viktor petrenko  well certainly everyone knows that this original program  centres around kurt and viktor  technically they are equals  artistically they are opposites  viktor is a strong s classical skater and kurt is the dynamic and exciting skater and if both skaters complete all the eight required elements it's going to come down to a competition between two very contrasting styles  paul kurt isn't the only canadian who could be a factor here  that's right chris  with elvis stojko and michael slipchuk behind kurt browning  we have the potential to match the pairs' performances of last night by putting three men in the top ten which in a field of thirty-four is   gonna going to be quite an accomplishment  it's going to be very interesting and we begin with the first of three canadians michael slipchuk of edmonton crowd cheering   michael is attending his fourth world championships  he's hoping to improve on last year's eleventh place showing in halifax  he also considers himself canada's luck charm  in his three previous worlds a canadian has won the world championship with slipchuk in attendance   michael's first element is his combination the triple axle  double toe   unfortunately it appears from here as though that jump the first one the triple axel was over-rotated  i mean that's one of the more difficult triples to do and it's one that all the top competitors here are trying   no problem with the triple toe   i must say that in michael's four years of attending the world championships his most improved aspect of his skating has been his level of performance  he really goes out there and tries to sell the program get his audience involved and make it look like he's having fun and enjoying his skating  well i think he's really comfortable with this program  it's the second year for this program and it really seems to suit him   stray cat strut he's skating to  aside from his one mistake in his jump combination i thought he did an excellent performance and he looked really comfortable and really covered a lot of ice out there today  i i thought he almost relaxed after the first element was over  he knew he'd missed it but he continued on and he had a great performance after that  michael slipchuk of the royal glenora in edmonton  he was third at the nationals but just getting over a bad case of strep throat  here's a look at the trip axel  he just didn't seem to get all the way around in the rotation   you have   it's unfortunate   you have to remember here that in the short program you have to attempt the element if you wish to get merit for it  so therefore if you don't attempt the second jump even though you've missed the first one in the comp combination  you won't get any marks for it  he said he was about at about  seventy percent in saskatoon but he feels great now  he's had time to get in shape and that should improve his long program from what we saw in saskatoon  well unfortunately with the early draw as well i think the marks are gonna going to be a little bit lower  than we had hoped  and here are the first set of marks for michael slipchuk  there are fives but a four point five from the japanese judge as well as the american judge   he talks it over with his coaches you know mark on the right they haven't caught him on the left  and the presentation marks are higher  five twos and five threes but for the twos i  two scores in the fours from the japanese and american judge once again  right now early in the competition michael slipchuk of canada is in second place   viktor petrenko of the soviet union is getting his last-minute instructions  more from the world figure skating championships in munich  after this tv advertisements   and on this tuesday evening welcome back to the olympiahalle in munich germany  c b c's continuing primetime coverage of the nineteen ninety-one world championship  still to come tonight canadians lloyd eisler and isabelle brasseur go for gold in the pairs  you know whether it's the pairs' or the men's singles  jumping is a very important part of this sport  in tonight's installment of the perfect sixes to explain the evolution of jumping in skating once again here are barbara underhill and paul martini short pre-recorded segment   viktor petrenko of the soviet union is one skater who has taken the art of jumping to new heights  at ice level it almost appears as if he's jumping over the boards  and he is the main challenger for canada's kurt browning  chris i'm extremely excited about this program because viktor has an outstanding history of being a sk consistently short program skater  he's opening with the big combination triple axel  triple toe loop   absolutely gorgeous combination   the next jump will be a trip lutz   perfect   even note the arm position in the landing of that jump  he's got such control out there   viktor attains such clean positions in his spins and it's a nice f feature that he has and not a lot of skaters have   i find that every single move that he makes is a conscious  effort and he knows exactly where his body is at all times  very controlled   chris i thought that's the finest program we've seen here so far in this competition  many people might say that bizet's carmen has been done before  but when you do it like this you got nothing to be ashamed of  well he won the original program in halifax and he certainly has thrown down the gauntlet for kurt browning here  standing ovation and that includes this large contingent of canadians  they love great skating and we've just witnessed it  the thing that is most impressing about this program is the package  from the minute he steps on the ice to the minute he finishes  it's a complete unit  it's what every skater strives for  here's a look at the combination the triple axel triple toe loop  look at the height on that jump  perfectly in control   and the triple toe loop just gorgeous  it had as much flow going in as it had coming out  even the position in the with the  arms and the landing shows such control and such confidence   well there's no doubt these are first place marks and look at them five eights and five nines for technical merit  well this is gonna going to be a really tough program to beat  kurt's really gonna going to have to pull one out out of the hat today  it's interesting though they have left room for kurt  a lot of five eights there  well they must  you must remember that kurt browning is the defending world champion  and the second set of marks the artistic marks five nines a five seven from the canadian judge mary pearson five eights and five nines the rest of the way  undoubtably the best original program we've seen so far  viktor petrenko is the leader   kurt browning is getting his final instructions from coach michael jiranek  the world champion is next when we return to munich tv advertisements segment on coach michael jiranek   well munich is a very special place for michael jiranek  he and his wife renata defected to the west through the bavarian capital and he hopes that kurt browning can create more fond memories this week as the skaters go through their final warm-ups  and barb and paul what an interesting group we have out on the ice  kurt browning todd eldredge elvis stojko of canada and christopher bowman  chris   chris as we watch them warm up i'd like to point out that in the short program there are eight required elements no more no less that must be executed in this program  they include a jump combination the most critical element  which must be any two jumps executed back to back consisting of double or triples however there should not be a step in between  they must do an individual triple jump which must be preceded by some footwork steps a double axel a combination spin a flying spin and another spin of their own creation which must have at least fifteen rotations and two different sequences of footwork  i'd also like to point out that kurt and viktor are virtually equal when it comes to their technical abil  abilities but what the judges are gonna going to have to decide upon is which style they prefer because their styles are completely contrasting  there's christopher bowman  todd eldredge just fell  is is that important this close  i it's something that can rattle some skaters where other skaters will just fluff it off and won't even let it enter their head  now what's in kurt browning's head right now  he knows viktor petrenko has skated a brilliant original program but he also knows that in saskatoon he earns a six for his original program  i think knowing kurt all he's worried about is what his job is and i think we're gonna going to go out   he's gonna going to go out  there and do that job  he looked very good on warm-up  he looked a little tight when he first came out then   and then pulled off a few triple axels and he   he looks to have really relaxed   he's the first skater out   and we are set  canada's top athlete in nineteen ninety  the two-time world champion hoping to three-peat and already the canadian fans are on their feet  he will also be opening with his combination triple axel  triple toe loop   another absolutely gorgeous triple axel triple toe loop combination   the triple flip is the next crucial element   absolutely w the best i've ever seen him execute it   chris it's always so exciting to see two great competitors  like petrenko and browning come out here and lay their best cards on the table  this is what great figure skating is all about  aside from what he does on the ice listen to the ovations  the fans want the sixes might even want nines for kurt browning  but it's that competitive fire along with what he does on the ice that i think makes him stand out  and kurt is always great under pressure  he really pulled this one off today skating right after petrenko  here's a a look at the combination  look at the height right over the boards on the  on the triple axel   great landing straight into the triple toe and another great jump
