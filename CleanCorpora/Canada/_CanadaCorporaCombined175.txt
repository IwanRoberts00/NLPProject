 ya  you need something that's go going    you need a tougher ski  i want something that holds on ice because i like  i need to tackle that ice  laugh it's like you know what i mean though  it's so so often you go and there's lots of ice  i want like good sharp edges and ski so i can feel in control on ice as much as possible you know  right   sure  well you know i mean uh that's why sometime you're going to have to spend a little bit more because the thing is is that you need   when you go into uh when you go into   into uh more advanced skis usually you're getting something that's a little bit lighter a little bit stronger  okay and so what happens is you're using better materials okay using better materials  better fibreglass stronger epoxy  mhh hmm   right   uhm it's it's it's a lot  there's many many many many considerations okay   okay   is there a ski like this like that would be comparable  like uh this is the only ski that you've showed me in this line  are there oth other   can i see like the other skis that are in this line  sure  what do you want to see   well just show me what you have  well uhm  that's what a k two  that's a k two  this is a k two  it's on a two words   it's a   it's not great though  isn't like isn't like carhartt  or  ya it's a good name  rossignol's a good name  every ski here is a good name  right  everything   even this elan business  elan has actually made a lot of improvements over the past few years  they're not   but they're not   they're not very highly regarded a number of years ago  ya that's what i heard   however they they've worked a lot  their engineers designed a lot of word skis where you see two words materials making better   word   mm hmm  uhm and as a result as a result  they were able to develop some some excellent skis  a lot of people were very pleased with them  okay  they tested very well on the market by testers  and most of the people who test these skis are at level four instructors ah level three level four which uh  level four in canada i think you're talking about uh  eight eight to ten people who have that  oh so real hotshots   ya   it's it's very limited  they're very technical skiers  they really they know how to work a ski  they know how to gain a performance from a ski  right  and uh you know it's it's they're very  they're top notch  they're top quality skiers and they can tell the difference between they can tell the difference between  between a beginner ski and ah and an  advanced skier's ski  right right   so if you put  what i was referring to before about you having to spend more money it's that if i put you if i put a type four  skier on a on a on a beginner ski   you know he'll be able to ski with it or she will be able to ski with it however the thing is is that they the ski  will not perform to that to the skier's ability  right   right   and then what happens is they become frustrated and they'll probably take them off and they'll trash them right away  okay  now jus just   now just remember a few words saving  is is is is is word  are no good   okay well i'm not a level four uh  laugh i'm not even a level one  okay   i'm minus laugh five or something so   okay   uh so what else  what uh what other skis here like   would would you re recommend    well what would you recommend like if  what would i recommend  like a good price for a word ski kind of thing  well one of the things i like to ask is i like to ask you what were skiing on before  uhm well first i h had   well i had heads but somebody ripped them off  uh huh  and before that it was like these spaldings like  word   spaldings are a really good ski actually  ya but they're old  i mean they were like at least  like i bought them second-hand about ten years ago so  they're probably like at least fifteen years old  mhh hmm   and i took them  also when i got new boots i went to get them adjusted and uh you know took the skis and the guy said to me he goes these skis are not safe to ski on because the bindings are so old  mhh hmm  and i was like oh okay whatever  and then the weirdest thing was that uh that   i skied on them anyway for that day and then i hung them up that night and the next time like i went to the country the binding was lying on the floor laugh next to the ski  like it just fell off  ya   ya  so obviously ya was right   the person in the sales shop was pretty   right   ya   i'm lucky i didn't break my neck you know  it's important to listen to people that are in the ski shops because they make a recommendation like that chances are they usually  you know they're not they're being   honest  and the thing is is it's it's it's a difference between there's a difference between somebody saying this ski or this you know this binding is not sold  you know and trying to make your sale or for being honest and to make more and more   maybe three words   right   no ya he i don't think he  was making a sale because it was just like the shop where the  repairs word   ya   like the regular shop   was this at a ski hill or was it at   ya it was up a hill  it was up a hill  ya ya  see that's the thing is the people who work at the hills most of the people who work in the shops have to be uh certified  technicians   oh okay   and then they have to go through courses and they have to pass and make sure that uh they know how to do it  they know what they're doing   right   okay so you  so wait   so what were you skiing on before  you okay so you > had said the spaldings   spaldings spaldings   and then you had head word    and you never actually got to use them  head bindings   ya i never even tried them   ya   well uh you know heads uh heads are heads are a pretty good ski you know because uh   ya   so what do you have here that's a head   in head uhh let's see  we'll have to take a look and see   uhm let's take a look at head classic   head classic this isn't actually a bad ski   no  a few words   well   laugh you look like laugh   whoa you're not supposed to judge a ski by the  way it looks  well   exactly   yup  uhm anyways besides nobody's looking actually looking at you skis when you're skiing  ya only on the chair  only on the chair  it's a fashion statement you know it's always very important  that's the most important thing   laugh no word  fashion statement maybe three words   right  in my experience as a as a  salesperson you know i mean it happens  laugh   it happens  people are very kinda kind of   fashion conscious and uh they want something that looks good and  they want they want they want they they they themselves   wanna want to look good  yes   you know whereas when you have uh when you have people who are just caring about themself they're not usually looking for product   they are they are but at the same time it's not as important  ya it's secondary  ya it is   but at the same time you ain't  gonna going to buy something that you really think is ugly  well  well i'm not  i mean why buy something that's word   that doesn't surprise me to be honest   ya  laugh whatever  ha ha fake laugh   don't insult the customer   <[ honk honk   these are nice   what about these ones   a few words actually a pretty good ski  ya  uhm   how much are they  word four hundred dollars  four hundred dollars but they're marked down to two forty-five  two forty-five  yup   oh so these are all the prices down here  yup  so two twenty-five is the cheapest to you  phrase   three fifty   we also have some seven hundred dollar skis that are marked down to four seventy-five  ya well i'm not gonna going to be buying those  maybe we should look at the second-hand ones because the truth is i don't know really think i can afford a lot of this   okay   ya   these are more  oh these are more over here  ya  these are all  ya these are more over here  there's these uhm   oh really  ya  phrase   these are cheap eh ninety-five dollars   uhm  oh but but then  word   maybe three words   ya   this is actually i think this one here would be a pretty good ski for you  which one  the last one  ya  but they don't have your size so i'm not gonna  going to recommend it  okay   uhm   scratch that  not because two or three words   these ones is one seventy  oh you're talking about these ones  no i'm talking about these ones  there's a one seventy right here   ya word   but you said one seventy-five is better for me eh   that's a bit short eh  it's a bit short   one seventy one seventy-five a few words   ya  a few words   i fe feel i feel more comfortable i maybe three word ride on one seventy-five  ya  and how much are these   those are word   one ninety-five   mm hmm  mm  i'm gonna going to go look at the second laugh   oh so there's about two words eh  ya  and there's word huh  ya conversation drowned out by background noise, 55 seconds   what  they're what  those are  those are uh one eighty  those are one eighty  a hundred and eighty centimetres  that's too long  ya and there's no binding on them either  okay then that's no good   these are one seventies   ya  it's a junior ski though  how can you tell they're a junior ski just from looking at it  well it's my expertise you know  right laugh   laugh   okay   word a few words  what are they thinner like  they're a little bit thinner  uh they're not as strong not made for those people who are as heavy  generally the kids who word that  particular ski tend to be ah a little bit lighter  okay  so it's for smaller people conversation drowned out by background noise, 15 seconds   is that a good ski  yes this is a this is a very good ski  ya   however they're bent  they're bent  ya  look at that  oh  phrase   how much are they asking  they're asking uh two hundred dollars  eww oh i'm not paying for bent skis  no conversation drowned out by background noise, 10 seconds   i'd like to try it laugh   ya   have you ever seen one  no conversation drowned out by background noise, 15 seconds   they're only sixty-five dollars  phrase   what about for you  this is the   no   phrase   well what are they   what's that  what a are   a few words   a few words looking at uh the  word at two words   hmm   what about this pair back here  sorry   these ones  that one's a little bit long conversation drowned out by background noise, 25 seconds   so is that it for the second-hand bit   uh that's it for the second-hand  so uh you don't think there's anything here that would be good   uhm not really no  no   word phrase  conversation drowned out by background noise, 35 seconds   uh do do you guys just not get a lot of short ones  that's it   you know word sometimes you know people   who will uh who will trade their equipment in   and they'll go to a ah they'll go to ah a   second-hand store  mhh hmm   or some some some places they accept trade-ins whereby  okay   where the trade is basically you go and then you bring your old equipment in and they word   you get a discount   they evaluate it and then they knock the price off of their uh off of the skis that you're buying   right  ya   so they might have uh something a little bit more in your uh in your price range  and perhaps they might have a little bit more selection  hmm  i don't know   so does does the trading post have second-hand skis  uhm two words they do   a few words   s so   so it doesn't look like there's much in the second-hand department  no there's not too much  so   hmm   how are you fixed for credit   would you like to to perhaps or perhaps you'd like to look at some more skis  well i'd like to keep looking at the skis cos that's the main thing that i want to get  right   okay
