back when i went out jogging and i'd take her she could hardly make it around once  around jean de manse jean de  manse   oh really   ya  by the end of the second second uhm turn  she would i i mean she'd  she'd be running with her tongue hanging down to the ground  she'd be just out of breath  this time she keeps right up  she gets a little tired  she was a little tired near the end of three words second   how bout about you    i was exhausted laugh   i was i was dead   edie / [ > lay down  now she now you're finally hooking up with her   lay down   no no  not yet   not yet  i've had enough   you guys are getting to   you two are working together on this getting more in shape  word   how did rick look this morning  cough oh is he into this still   he's a little tired  cos you didn't talk to him last night   usually you guys arrange the night bef  before   you stopped doing that  no/[>   we've agreed cough not to uhm not to   make any arrangements  so if he doesn't arrive at six you know he's not going to show up  we gave ourselves ten minutes  so at ten after six if either of us are not there we don't we just go   it's nice actually i'm now motivated to even start running on the off days  cos we're just doing it four times a week word   four times a week is still quite a lot   so   but i'd like to do it off days  but he says you know and ah and i think he's right every day doesn't allow your body to recouperate  it is it's true   you shouldn't and supposedly like when i was with  johnny he was very into working out and all that he said a good way to do it was like three days one day off two days day off three days day off two days day off     cough   oh three days on  three days on one day off two days on one day off  three days on one day  right   hmm  so its like five out of seven  because you do have to let your body rest because your performance will be that much de uh less   you know if you you know  if you don't allow your body to recuperate  mhh hmm     well if you're permanently tired it doesn't work   ya you don't do as m as good  a workout  mhhm  cough   but i've yet to to feel that  rush and that feeling after i finish and that it's ah per   after an excellent workout you know you know how  sometimes you   have you ever   oh ya oh ya  actually so have i   or just that was you know you just kind of hit one word that is very good you  know and so you feel like you're on top of the world for the rest of the day  phrase   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  i've never felt that  you should  you should come out with us  i'm not going to out with you guys gar   well you guys are a bit too serious about it  how come   we're not too serious  i wh   well i mean to get up at five thirty in the morning to go jogging three days a week  cough i agree within principle but i have a hard enough time getting up at seven and walking the dog  mhh  you know   and that's not to say i don't enjoy it after i've gotten up  but i think   would you like some more   nuh ya a little bit please  maybe could you put some water on for tea  sure  do you want some tea no   yes please  do you want black or herbal   doesn't matter  well we got both  what do you want  i don't know it doesn't matter  i'll just put whatever in word   gar make some regular maybe  words regular  well if nobody's gonna going to  make a decision i'll   now what if i wanted herbal  no just teasing  the water's hot you make your own cup  laugh   do you want some more chicken no   no i'm not even hungry anymore  i don't know why i'm still eating  go on finish it  go finish it  okay   did you see rosanne today  no i spoke to her on the phone a couple of times but i   haven't seen   ya she she called me  well i don't know what time it was it was mid-afternoon sometime she called me just to uhm just tell me that uh she didn't get that job that she had applied for  hmm  i think she was a little bit bummed out  but   ya i think she was too   cough   what a   probably because of the language thing  ya  but i mean i don't know you guys are getting a lot of call backs  i think something's gonna going to fall out  gosh darn it i hope so  something's gonna going to fall out ya  mhh  no but i b i don't think th   i don't think there's been any place that you've been refused an interview period  words   i didn't get an interview for the one that rosanne got turned down for  oh really  but i also didn't  usually i call back and make an effort  this one i   didn't make any effort cos i knew  rosanne wanted it   lay down   edie lay down   get down on the fl  floor   lay down   it didn't seem fair to me that i knew rosanne wanted and then i was gonna going to  get pushy     cough   that wouldn't be right  mhhm   and its hard to kinda kind of go off in different directions   i mean you're both using ellen eh as your   reference  mhhm   not as a reference no  no but i mean she's she's   kinda kind of screening you onto other things  i mean she's   mhhm mhhm  did you ever talk to what's her name uhm sher  er from uh resources at the u a p university affiliated program   oh starts with an e  erin murphy   no i didn't  i haven't heard anything from her either  i really don't  like i know i should have but  like i know what the answer's gonna going to   be  you need french and i don't have french  no but i mean for batshaw you don't need  you don't need that high of a level   mhh   batshaw was on the news today  what were they saying  uh the government had suggested that they cut their  budget by six percent and batshaw responded by saying they honestly couldn't do it  they di like it'd be a huge blow to cut it by six percent  hmm   and they didn't offer any thing as an alternative   no  cos queen elizabeth did it yesterday  i think they're the first hospital or whatever to  to actually come forward and and  offer an alt alternative   like cos they were one of the nine hospitals that were  gonna going to be cut  mhh hmm   and they've offered an incentive or kind of   a a more cost efficient uhm framework that uh  will basically integrate a c l s c centres locaux de services communautaires health clinics as well as like twenty-four hour physician care as well as  ah an emergency service plus private ya into one facility  ha   phrase   to create a mega complex  really  hmm  gosh they worked that out pretty quickly  private physician offices and stuff and they're  all word in a  words   hmm   cough   to keep the hospital open and keep the necessary services still there  yup  because they're saying i mean they're saying   transfer everything to the c l s cs but the c l s cs can't handle what they've got already so   no i know   hmm you know  and do you know what any like  have you heard any of the response for it  no nope no  so who are you talking to at batshaw that said that they were hit with  oh you said it was on the news   i saw it on the news  anyway you can call cindy and find out what's going on with it  cindy called me today actually cos i was supposed to go and meet with her tomorrow to get my evaluation but she doesn't have it finished  so i have to go she's going to phone no  i'm supposed to phone her tomorrow to re schedule  hmm  humming   actually i kind of miss working there  i didn't think i would but i do  have you run into any clients on the street  ya  did you  what did they say  yesterday i ran into uhm one of my  one of the kids i was working with  she ignored me completely  that's gonna going to be a normal  reaction   ya that's right   that's gonna going to   be a normal response when you run into clients  ya  mhhm  no that's what i expected  and i was actually kind of happy about that too  i wasn't in a good mood so i didn't laugh feel like talking  ya  no you're either gonna going to get two responses  you're either gonna going to get them to completely ignore you or you're gonna going to get them screaming from across a crowded room to get your attention  or they're gonna going to be very angry   well there's one client who i'm quite worried   laugh uh no i keep thinking about  bobbie anne bobbie anne sherman   well no well i'm not i'm not i'm not  speaking derogatorily i'm just saying that   derogatorily   isn't that right  words   i'm not sure   anyway   sniff no i mean look at bobbie anne   i'm not sure   that's funny   i mean bobbie anne was one of the secretaries that we had when i was working at the canadian mental health association  she was manic depressive and when her lithium levels were off  she'd go into a manic phase  and when she was manic i mean you couldn't give her enough typing  i mean she'd just laugh the pages   were flying off the typewriter   that's great   ya  the rest of the year she was  unfortunately the higher the manic phase went the lower she became after the two words   really  ya ya  it's such a dreadful   it's polar extreme highs extreme lows  it must be extremely frightening to go through  mhh  edie do you want to go outside  i'm back to this magazine that rob   gave me  go on   go on  well then in ya come  sit down  the magazine you gave me   there was an article written by uhm uhm someone who's not 'who' suffers from depression  cough   cough not manic depression but depression   so it's clinical depression  ya  and describes a bit you know just the very s   very superficial way what what a person living with depression uhm can expect  it's quite something you know it's   i think it's really frightening  the views of the mind  mhh  one friend who talks about it all the time  and she like how she describes it is really terrifying  ya   mhh   is she on prozac all the time now or is is is  is it kind of an on off  she's actually not on it right now  does she notice a big difference when she goes off it  i notice a big difference laugh when she goes off it  really  how   mh hmm   like is it just subtle things or  no they're actually really drastic things uhm  and she's tot totally  unaware of it  no she's pretty aware of it actually but she tends to downplay it
