 you know it was eight o'clock they were ready to go laugh  they were just waiting for me  hmm  ya so my cou cousin   my mother the other day was  well did i did i tell you that my  i talked to my mother the other day she was telling me about  ya i told you about my cousin her  cousin ya   jack ya   mhh hmm  ya he's uhm three words  second marriage on the rocks   she hasn't had any more uhm tremors or anything your mom  nah nah she had she had an appointment she had an appointment yesterday  was it yesterday  ya with this doctor  a sort of you know stomach doctor or whatever   uhm that the doct doctor   when she was in the hospital that the cardiologist  had sort of uhm  i don't know if it's a cardi cardiologist  probably not the cardiologist but the doctor the m d   that was that was there  mhh hmm   the g p that was looking after her  uhm he's he he's the one he gave her this specialist's number and said you know make an appointment with him   so that you know see what he says   and after waiting  she waited like three months to get an appointment  and yesterday  sorry and it was yesterday  mhh hmm  and she called before going for some reason  i don't know why   mhh hmm   she just wanted to check the time  that it was the right time  mhh hmm   and the secretary tells her that uhm what do you mean  didn't didn't uh didn't somebody call you to tell you that the appointment was cancelled because the doctor's on vacation   laugh   cancelled or postponed  it was postponed but i mean didn't give her another date  it was just it just said you know the secretary insisted   i mean you know my mother said no one called  you know nobody called me  but she said and the secretary insisted  that she was right because she said in my book here i have  you know there's a note saying that the person was contacted that you were contacted and told that you know the appointment was postponed  hmm  so my mother was really upset  i mean and now she can't get another appointment i think before october with the guy   is that the only reason they came to town yesterday  no no no uhm no cough   no no cos the appointment was in laval  it was in laval centre   oh okay   but i mean so the thing is she didn't end up going to the appointment  mhh hmm  so i mean she was disappointed but it was ah  it was good that she called because had she gotten all dressed up  and and uh you know gotten there to find out that you know  but i mean i i told her she should just relax about this  she knows what her problem is  laugh she just calms down doesn't get so anxious and upset  she'll have less stomach problems  mhh hmm  you know and she said well you know i thought i'd go just to see what he says  you know maybe he'll change my medication you know  and then maw mom laugh you know  laugh you've had this problem for tons of years  for years   mhh hmm  but uh no now she's she's going i think it's it is next week  it's monday and tuesday that she's going to a hospital in st jerome or something for all these tests these uh for   the heart   but i think maybe my father was right you know  i mean cos he said right from from the start that she's got no problem with her  it's her stomach that  and the doctor also said that  that it could be sort of like the stomach problems  that could  i don't know what the problem   well i mean at the time i didn't believe my  fath father like i didn't want to believe my father because i'd you know i'm just thinking he's just it's just wishful thinking on his part  you know he doesn't want to believe that  well that's the one side of it but much more apt i mean  how  what's he's going to base his opinion on  what does he know   you know what i mean  you're talking about   well he says he just he says that he knows my mother laugh   sure but you you're talking about reasons why he wants to think this or that  i'm saying regardless what he wants to think he hasn't got   i mean he unclear words   well i mean he just says that he knows my mother and he knows that she gets upset and anxious and whatever and that  uh because it is a strange a strange  sort of coincidence that that she never has stomach problems when she's on vacation  whereever it is that's she's vacationing if she's in italy or f  or you know or mexico she says she never has stomach problems  fine fine but  and she says she eats and and and  drinks   sure but we haven't we haven't   really really determined except for what your father says and perhaps one doctor whether it's a stomach problem or a heart problem   well i mean there's definitely a stomach problem  but the but what i think is it's psychosomatic  that a lot of it is  maybe there there is something there  cos i do believe that we all have s  sort of weak points in our body  you know that when we're stressed that's what's gonna   going to hurt  like i mean some people get splitting headaches  mhh hmm   uhm some people get backaches   mhh hmm   you know some people get stomach aches  you know   sort of that's where the tension comes out  so that i mean in that sense it's psychosomatic  and i think that's what   it might well be  my only point is still that your your  father will have an opinion sure but if it's only an opinion  i mean he hasn't got anything  well ya sure he's not a doctor right   you know   but sometimes i mean nor do doctors know for sure laugh  right i mean laugh with all this  basically all this medication doctors give my mom i mean a lot of it is is sort of just tranquilizers laugh   you know like librax  sure  and then sort of antacids and you know sort  of almost over-the-counter stuff you know  right   well how would you feel though i mean if if  if you had some major problem some incident and you know and you went to hospital and the doctor said well maybe it's your stomach maybe it's some problem with your heart and i said aww it's just your stomach aww come on it's   i mean how well would you   i might be trying to reassure you but you wouldn't be terribly impressed with with me playing it down   cough   ya ya i see i see what you mean  ya ya i think i'm sure she's still anxious about  you know in in her mind she's still not sure what it is that she has  well i mean frankly if breath   but she's had she hasn't had  any problems any more problems     sure but i mean if if i   ever had anything at all and and you started diagnosing me well i mean laugh i wouldn't put much worth in it and and i'd let ya  you know   you wouldn't appreciate it would you   thanks dear  well you know laugh   i mean what if i hear a funny sound in the engine and you gave an opinion and i didn't think much of that  i mean that's a  ya sure but i wouldn't give an opinion cos i don't know anything about  well do you do know something about my heart  laugh no i don't know anything about that either  well  ya so i guess looking into sort of like teaching overseas   i do think that uhm i mean i i   didn't really think that we could sort of like aim as high  as universities you know as teaching   in in universities   mhh hmm   ya  i think there though   but whe i mean but we   i think our problem is we've got about three priorities and we haven't decided which is  the first priority laugh   ya you know i mean do we want to stay here and get the license  yes or no   mhh  if we do is it worth all the assisting with it  then that's   you know it seems to take forever   that's one priority  the second priority is   well not priority but a a decision  do you want to leave the comfort of your house you know  and if so for how long  how long would it have to be to make it worthwhile  i mean six months even six months in another country is is  is fooling around  you're not going to get something worthwhile  mhh hmm mhh hmm  ya sure i agree   you you you'd / [ >  just about have to stay a minimum of two years you know  yup or one year for sure  well you wouldn't tell them one year  mhh hmm ya sure ya   mhh  ya so we should remember that then  the guardian on tuesdays and the times the times literary supplement british newspapers on friday  mhh hmm  or educational supplement  although how long do they take to get here  no eh eh i'm sure libraries get them on the same day  how could they  why would they   i mean if they're made to come out on a certain day in  in england  well sure you can get the day's the day's papers  well you can get the new york times on the same day  you can get   new york times is one thing  ya well no cos i'm thinking of la repubblica sort of the italian newspaper  uhm but you can get it  i think there's one day like in the stores there's one day or in certain you know certain stores there's one day a week where they where they do get the day's paper  like maybe it's every friday or whatever  depends on when flights come in   mhh hmm  but we can ask you know  ya  cough we can ask where we where we can get ah where we can get a paper on the same day that it comes out  ya because i agree with you  i mean it's pretty useless if you read it a week later  mhh hmm   i guess   ya but i guess   i i guess  seeing my parents we'll just we'll put the nix on that i guess cos  seeing what  seeing my parents  i mean even for christmas   we have no idea what's happening  christmas is flat and boring out there anyways you know  i mean i'll just leave it in the air i guess  what do you what what are you saying  a a about seeing your parents  well ah ah   when when are you going to see them  well we toyed with this summer  that went out  we toyed with this autumn  that didn't work out  well that we don't know   no  i mean we don't know  there's between now and and > you know between now and </} october they can come out  anytime between now and october it'll still be nice out  well they didn't seem very keen on the idea  well i don't know maybe it really is that your dad's not feeling you know maybe it is that he is really not feeling  sort of up to it because of this you know this  dizziness  dizziness ya   the the problem that he's been having  i mean i understand that  you know when i told my parents i mean my mom said ya sure i understand that  you know i mean that you don't want to be traveling  you don't want to be far from home when you're not feeling  physically fit   but i mean it doesn't mean that they wouldn't want to come in september or october  mhh i got the impression they weren't terribly keen on the idea
