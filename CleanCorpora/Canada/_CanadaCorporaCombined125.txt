 it's now nine minutes to one o'clock  you're listening to radio noon  my name is denise storey   it is fourteen degrees in a wet montreal right now  now we have the business panel and uh you can guess of course what has still dominated the business news news everywhere really still and that's the r word  may niven is a reporter with the globe and mail's report on business  wayne lewis is a business columnist with the montreal gazette  hello to both of you  hi   we survived it laugh somehow laugh   hi laugh   do you spit though   like like lucien bouchard's little boys do spit  referendum spoken like a growl   yeah laugh   spitting noises   laugh how has business reacted to this just a astounding week   well   it's it's funny uh you know  some of the things that happen in business are so short-term that  they're they're funny  uhm on tuesday morning the tse toronto stock exchange just shot up into the stratosphere  uhm the dollar went way up  the bank rate fell and prime rate fell too  the last two things are pretty darn good for consumers  but this by no means was as we know a definitive vote and business is still absolutely uhm paralyzed by what to do by this  and in many senses they are literally paralyzed  uhm we we talked about matrox before the electronics company in the west island  it was going to shelve an expansion plan altogether if the yes side won  the no side won but it's not going fully ahead with that expansion plan  it it doesn't know how much of it it will do but it certainly knows it's going to farm out some of its r and d activities to uh florida where they all have they already have a small presence  there's just uncertainty right left and centre  especially in light of parizeau's resignation and uh lucien bouchard's uh contemplation over his fate  matrox is a very good example of what is going on in the small and medium size business community  you have to make a sort of distinction because if you speak to economists about what's going to happen to the economy as a whole uh they tend to believe uh whichever way their sympathies lie that uh the economy will get back on a on an even keel pretty fast  a very large part of quebec's industry uh is made up for example of resource industries and it's very very difficult to pick up a vein of gold and move it out of quebec  uhm so things like that   heavy laugh   things like yeah very heavy  things like that won't won't be very much affected uh and they probably wouldn't be too severely affected even if quebec were indeed to go ahead and separate some day  but the growth in quebec's economy and the new jobs in quebec's economy come from the small and medium size business sector which include a lot of high tech businesses and a lot of service businesses  so matrox is a good example of those businesses uh and other very large uh uh business the apparel business which depends uh on ontario and the rest of canada for eighty or ninety percent of its sales  and businesses like that aren't ready to pack up their bags and leave  although at least a few of them are doing that  there's a company called milton funwear we may have mentioned before that that they've had it with the  uncertainty and even with the no they said they were moving  uhm yes   uhm hmm   there are other businesses that are just saying well you know we're going to go ahead  we're going to stay here but we're going to be very cautious and we're going to put what investment we can outside quebec because we want to hedge our bets  so i think that i think that  we've we've shot ourselves in the foot and we're going to suffer a ser a long term and serious   loss of job creation   and it's it's not just uhm investors with hard assets factories and so on  uhm we've got money managers that are really important   an important part of the canadian and the quebec economy these uhm managers who uh have a lot of investors from from   overseas and so on  they're not sure what to do about canadian equities  they're very doubtful about quebec equities  we saw morgan stanley being very very skittish on uh canadian equities  and uh a lot of fund managers are simply not sure about what to do  so we've got that aspect and a lot of uhm foreign investors hold canadian and quebec debt so that has lots of implications  all of these factors that we're talking about have a lot of implications for for quebec's books its public finances which are in a very messy state  uhm the deficit was five point seven billion for nineteen ninety-four ninety-five  it's anybody's guess as to whether targets for this fiscal year can be met  especially with   the possibility of taxpayers leaving and companies leaving  but that that's a huge question   well i'll i'll  give you my bet  my bet would be very strongly that they will not be met  uh quebec blew its uh its projections last year by a billion dollars or something  i'd be sure that they are going to blow their projections this year uh by maybe not that much but by a very large amount  uh ontario has already had to make massive additional cuts on top of the initial harris cuts because they were running hundreds of millions  of of dollars behind on their revenues because the economy's been slow  how much slower has it been in quebec  i'd like to  i would like to move on get put the referendum behind us cos i mean the truth is   i would like to but i can't   wouldn't we all laugh   oh really laugh   we want to talk about it endlessly forever and ever   we're not obsessed  let's talk about the the phone companies  they're they're mad  they're mad yeah laugh   ma bell is mad   one company is laugh   mad as hell and not going to take it anymore laugh    you don't want to make ma bell mad i guess laugh    mad as bell laugh   oh oh laugh   good one laugh   but what's the story  well the local the c r t c said that local phone rates are allowed to rise by four dollars a month over the next two years  that's two dollars each year  and then there's going to be some sort of unknown increase as of january nineteen ninety-eight  january first nineteen ninety-eight  and long distance rates would fall by an equiv   equivalent amount for most uh most consumers  uh what bell is is upset about is that  it it's still going to be regulated in the long distance market  and it says well why shouldn't competition simply prevail  why do we have to go to the c r t c and get our rates approved and go through lengthy hearings and so on   it thinks that there's just an unfair advantage especially by big american companies  it feels very threatened by the on  onslaught of a t and t and so on and some of the big heavyweights south of the border  uhm  they're still making money hand over fist aren't they  oh yeah laugh   they're they're making money hand over fist if you look at the total number of dollars that they're making  if you look at the total numbers of dollars they're making in relation to the amount of investment they have in their company i don't think that their profits are that impressive  uh and that's what they always like to look at  but you know when your making a billion dollars a year or  or something like that it's very difficult to uh to get a sympathetic hearing for that kind of a complaint  uhm  there is another aspect to this which is that uh what the c r t c is aiming at in the long run uh almost everybody uh who knows the industry and and has studied it believes is probably a good thing  it's competition both in the long distance field and in the local field  uh it's kind of   but is there any competition in the local field   absolutely none right now but there are cable companies that have wires to almost everyone's home  it would not be inconceivable for them to start up a parallel phone system  and indeed they've done that in some places like in the united kingdom  in fact uh videotron uh runs one of those competitve phone services   right in the u k yeah   i i would love to see competition because i would love to be able to fire my local cable company  and maybe i'd fire bell too if they couldn't offer competitive uh uh phone rates  maybe i'd just switch around  but the government the federal government has said it is committed to competition in all of these different areas of telecommunications cable and telephones and so on  so uh maybe we're seeing it uh put its money where its mouth is  uhm  what's the unemployment rate  we have figures word   yeah the unemployment rate has done one of   its the kind of contradictory things it does sometimes  the news looks bad because it went up by two-tenths of a percentage point uh in canada and i think three-tenths of a percentage point in quebec  the news really is good strangely enough  what happened was a whole bunch of people entered the labour force in october thinking that they were going to get jobs  many of them did but many of them didn't  so the unemployment rate goes up because there are more people looking but not finding  in fact the number of employed people went up by nineteen thousand across the country  and that's   that's especially significant that that happened in october of all months uh out of all years  which of course the referendum was making everybody uncertain  so the fact that people did feel positive enough about jobs being out there is is rather interesting  the big picture is that we had nearly a year of no employment creation from late nineteen ninety-four until late nineteen ninety-five  now we've had three months in a row of employment creation  that's good news  next hour on the phone-in we're going to get even further away from the referendum  we're taking you to a desert island   wow whoa   laugh can i come please  yes you can laugh   it's outside of canada   we're all invited   come on  everyone's doing it  what three books would you take with you to the desert island  that's easy  any three books by patrick o'brien who's a brilliant british uh historical novelist whose name does not uh influence my uh my choice  uh and they'd be particularly appropriate for a desert island because these are sea-faring historical novels uh based on the british navy  uhm i i'm a big fan of  bonfire of the vanities   i love that book  i could read it again and again  and i'll give a plug for a couple of   you'll take three copies of bonfire of the vanities   no i'll give a plug to two other uh actually local writers  one is uh carole corbeil  she wrote voice over a very interesting account of english and french montreal  the two current sort of crossing  a very good book  and the third one is by actually a friend of mine  her name is diana atkinson and she's just been nominated for a governor general's award  it's called highways and dance halls uhm   tales of a stripper and more   a lot more to that ook  it's a very complex very well-written book  terrific   that's great  thank you both of you  we'll see you next friday  thanks  that's may niven and wayne lewis   they are uh the radio noon business panel  may is a reporter with the globe and mail's report on business  wayne lewis is a business columnist with the montreal gazette  and next hour we want to know what three books you would take to a desert island  right now we have the time signal  at the beginning of the long dash following ten seconds of silence it will be one o'clock
