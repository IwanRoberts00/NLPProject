you're being a cellar dweller  laugh   and biorhythm having no rhythm but weather   word   laugh   ah vitamin e for ailing and healthy hearts  hmm by wilfred le shoot who was shot the naked ape and  worldwide french accent french dictionary french accent  yes okay thank you  yeah laugh   how much should i charge for each of those  uh try twenty-five or fifty cents  whatever you think okay   oh okay  okay well let's start over in this table  and this is stuff both for the sale and stuff that you think we should keep for the kids  mm mm   and there is some that falls in that category  yup  and there're some things here too which we can use   word   ah yeah right   you know  okay the scales i don't think it is very good  no well we don't need scales anyway  we don't  i think they should probably be heaved  yeah well heave them for a dollar  you think i should word   well get on it and show that it weighs people  uh i dunno don't know twelve pounds lighter than you actually are   laugh   y actually it weighed me eight pounds heavier laugh  oh did it  oh well that's why you wanna want to  throw it out  so it doesn't work  okay   yes exactly  that's why laugh   so okay i should uh i should  put the prices on right now while you're giving me assistance   okay well let's see   did you go to three words   no i don't think so two or three words  uh it's uhm probably   do you have uh   you have to speak towards the microphone  whoops  i won't speak towards the microphone  uh yeah that's uhm this is heavy  yeah  yeah just a sec   well word was adjusted it measures heavy  mm  so i think there's something wrong with it  it's very ancient  mm yeah  indeed it is the perfect scales if you want to lose weight  ha  cos it measures about eight pounds heavy two words  that's what i said laugh   two words   yeah  uhm  yeah so i don't know if i should even try to sell it  well you can   no sell it for the perfect scale for somebody who wants to lose weight because it always measures heavy   r really   you can set it back eight pounds too  oh yeah  and then it's okay    yeah it's true enough  okay   so adjust it  okay  you know so seven fifty laugh   no i don't know exactly how much  uh the thing is that there will be people who come and will pay whatever you've got on there  uh which is probably the majority of people  but also there're a good chunk who come and they wanna  want to bargain  so if you put it at a dollar they say oh fifty cents  so if you want a dollar out of it you put it for a dollar  two dollars   well really  yeah   so i'll put a dollar fifty  yeah  laugh you'll get a dollar out of it   cough   two or three words   okay uh   okay  intake of breath okay the clock  the clock's fine  word   yeah the clock's in perfectly good shape

just keep it for the kids but i don't i don't see any point in selling it  oh no no no no  no if it's like yours you might as well keep it  ah yeah  it's it's very much like yours from  the looks
