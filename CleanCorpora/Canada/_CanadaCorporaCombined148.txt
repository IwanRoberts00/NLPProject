songwriter  this is her first c d eh uh and it's being launched next week  uh by day she leaves her guitar and her singing voice at home  she goes off to work as a youth coordinator at the snowden y y m c a   she's been working with young people for almost a decade now  you must have been very young  including troubled teens and autistic children  elana's going to join me today to talk about some of her experiences with kids and uh tell me more about her music as well  hi  welcome to the program  thank you  good to meet you  uh now you work with teens  you were you were at an outdoor  concert  that's right   and somebody heard ya you   that's that's   tell me how that that turned into a job  laugh   laugh   uhm i would volunteer my time for this outdoor concert uh for kids in park extension  uhm hmm  and they do it every year  i mean it's ongoing even now  and someone from the ville de montreal who of course is involved in that program uh saw me there and decided that i would be an asset to the youth centre that was already in existence  uhm got me coded as a specialist and i started working with those kids on a very limited scale  what was it they saw in your in your   body language during the concert  do you do you know how to work an audience well or what  fairly well  i've had a lot of experience and the kids respond well to my music  uh huh   uhm i was involved in the you know all the  production aspect of it so  and i started working with these kids and teaching them the basics of guitar and vocals  working with them developing rap music with them  which was really something for me  that was uh  laugh   you not a rap fan or or not   not   rap's not first on your list let's put it that way   yeah   let's just say that i don't write it very easily and to bring in a very large amplifier and a drum machine and a keyboard and a this and a that and a   the noise levels were a little extreme when you're working with twenty kids at a time who are asking you twenty different questions plus the sound plus the  it was quite the experience  it was spinning huh  laugh   fiorinal a non-narcotic pain-reliever laugh   made made good money off me that year and uh  but it was their music of choice right it was the way they wanted to express themselves   yeah it was and that's exactly what you have to do    it's their music of choice  that's what you go for  tell me about the first experience with them because these were kids who probably don't have a very ho happy  home life if any home life at all right  some of them don't  some of them are uh some of them do come from uh single parent families  some of them are involved in uh some type of either   some of them are involved in some type of gang   most of them or some of them have been exposed to that milieu so they have a very different outlook than i do  uh they're the way that they judge their peers the way they judge their accomplishments is completely different from mine  but i learned a lot about them  i mean i learned from them from them   if they didn't if they stayed out of trouble it was something  if they finished school it was something  if they uh went on to do something bigger and better it was something  if they had a good day some of them it was something  there were times when i was really scared  most of the time it was just great  what scared you  they scared you or or the lives they had to lead scared you   uhm most of the time it was things that happened that would scare me  like when the police raided the centre and this weapon came in uh  that was pretty scary   that would scare me yeah   uh other things some of them were uh holding weapons of some type  so either in a bag or in a pocket whatever  when you found out they were there with these weapons it became sometimes sometimes the potential of a situation  you had to handle it  uhm hmm  these were things i mean  after a while you kind of got accustomed to   what kind of weapons we talking about knives and   in the knives and in the guns and in the whatever else happened to be around and in the word chains and  it really wasn't all the time though  it was just there were enough events that would happen that you were very aware of what was going on out there  and that's uh  but when you hear that and  and i  of course you're thinking about your own your own  personal safety but i mean do you think these kids are   are just trouble makers or or  they're dealing with the situation they know how the only way they know how to deal with it  i gather some of these kids were just protecting themselves in the milieu they live in right  you know you try   that's pretty much it  i think that some of the kids get in there and they do it for social reasons and emotional reasons  they need to to be involved in something and that's  that's how they do  and that's what's available to them  they have some of them don't have a home life  some of them uhm have gone through some abuse at home  yeah   yeah  and that's what this is what they get into and we your job was to try and get them out  other kids were just trying to exist you know in the milieu they were  and again it's not all the kids  and it wasn't all you know every day  but it was something that i'd never seen before  i'd never been involved in that before  i'd lived in another suburb  i had lived in like i don't know snowden where in my childhood it was fairly quiet  and even n d g notre-dame-de-grace wasn't really rough  yeah   so why didn't it spook you completely and say now i've got to find another line of work  what was it about the kids  they were just great kids  yeah  they were like you know this this  rap  they do rap shows now and this concert stuff and when the kid finally sits down and talks to you and and you can you know lend a hand and and   even now there's like four or five kids that still call my house and let me know what they're doing and i'm very proud of some of them  they've gone on to do lovely and wonderful things  yeah   well what how did you gain their trust  and get them to open up  i would imagine a lot of them to be pretty unresponsive to begin with and tell you to get lost at first  that's a nice way of putting it laugh   laugh well i have a list of other words here but i can't use any of them laugh   i think what you have to do with adolescents is you really have to wait and be patient  you have to listen to them  uhm not judge them  not give them the spiel that they get or they might get from somebody else  you know the when i was a child or uhm you know  i think you should be doing this   it takes a little longer uh with an adolescent  and they have to learn when they learn  to open up and they learn to relax and then then  that's it  yeah  then you're there  and then you have to take responsibility for what you're doing  cos at that point if you  i think personally if you turn away from them uhm  you're you're hurting them more than your helping them  hence i still get phone calls and  i'm still pretty much involved and life goes on with my adolescents at the y  same as kids from park-ex park-extension, a montreal neighbourhood   there's some kids i still speak to  and i gather music must have been a great key to open a door  that's a crummy ah metaphor but i i  gather it is right  laugh   it's a it's a good introduction  yeah  it's a good first step  and when the kids when you're when adolescents  that they really i don't know whether they glorify this industry which is fine  and everybody wants to be a guitarist and play guitar and be a rock star or a rap star or some type of musical   yeah yeah   uhm when they see you and they see you perform and if you do it fairly well and you you share with them  then at that point they feel like they are able to talk to you  they're able to reach out to you  you become familiar  you become accessible  and for that like i say   you've got something in common   that's it  well it's a first step  yeah  and then you have to carry it from there  i guess you you can't be afraid that one one of these days one of these kids is going to go away and not come back  i guess you've got to expect that right  it happens  you have to wait as you say and be patient and hope  that's right  uhm now dealing with these kids  even before that you you knew how to deal with kids with real problems  well these these were well physical as well as emotional  but you dealt with autistic children  much younger but again still somebody you had to reach in order to bring them out  do you see the trend somewhere  yeah laugh   yeah i had the opportunity i guess to uh  i was lucky  i had the opportunity to work with autistic kids at giant steps for a couple of years and  wow i was involved in the music program there  and the things that we did and we sang songs and we played drums and  now how old were these kids  i'd say they were much younger but how much younger  i three to eleven   two and a half three to eleven  oh okay  yeah so all pretty uh pubescent kids  yeah oh yeah  and uh it's just a great program there  i mean the attention that they give to the children  and the growth that at least i saw uhm of these students that were involved in this program and these programs is phenomenal  and it just you know when you see uh uh a three year old singing along with you and and  really getting into it  and big big eyes and big smile  and especially if it's a kid who has some problems communicating or some problems with comprehension it really is something  hmmm  them or a child who hasn't said much of anything for ages right  yeah  or ever or pretty much ever   that's exciting  yeah yeah   it was something  it was also very draining  i mean it was very very very draining  i was you know these kids they're physically  they're uh  it's very difficult  especially when they're bigger than you  and uh you know you you have  i remember getting bitten once and bursting into tears  and i went back to work the next day but it was just  the shock   it'd break your heart yeah   yeah that's pretty much what it did  yeah but of course again again  they have no other way of showing some things  and and their anger is ending up on your arm right laugh   your arm face yeah  yeah that's that's pretty much what happens is i don't think these kids  they can't uh express themselves verbally  they're gonna going to do  and you know something  adolescents are the same way in that way   i was just gonna going to say    you know you were saying is there is there a pattern here   but the music really uh is important
