 ya so sorry  made a little noise there uhm lighting my cigarette  ya no don't worry about it   but uhm what are the chances of going camping again before we start school  ooph well i don't know  i mean i'm supposed to start i'm supposed to start like next week  monday is when my contract  contract actually starts monday   ya  but the meeting with like the department meeting is only on the seventeenth  which is a wednesday  so what i was thinking of doing was going in monday  just to sort of get a bit of a feel of not " feeling for" the general of atmosphere and the cegep coll&egrave;ge d'enseignement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et professionnel and that  mhh hmm   cos that's when that's the first day   it's the students' it's their their called  de journ&eacute;e le word   ya  and i'd like to see if i can get stuff done on that day such as getting keys made  sure sure so you have to be here for monday but i mean   the weekend itself   ya   the weekend f the weekend following   that  no i mean this this immediate weekend  this weekend here  just because it's you know   oh the weekend following would be labour day right  no  when's labour day  no this weekend this weekend here is the weekend of the twelfth  okay  labour day is only on the uh labour day is the fourth of september   oh okay okay but   ya we've we've got like you know four weekends yet before labour day  ya i tend to think that uh september will be busy  the highways will be crowded  ya but i'm thinking i'd like to take this week like use as much time as i can this week to sort of airplane noise heard overhead starts prepare as much stuff as i can  you know prepare as many lessons as i can  this week   including the weekend   including including  the weekend   ya  well no  i mean i don't know  i don't wanna want to be working   ya but  it's lovely  living close to the airport isn't it  ya  but uhm well i just feel that already we haven't done so much this summer and already so much of it has gone by you know  yup   true airplane noise stops   true  but uhm i suggest next weekend   but then next weekend you   you know not this coming ne   not this coming weekend   but next weekend cos it'll you know it'll be  okay   ya   well actually that weekend i'm probably gonna  going to be in a panic cos it's the weekend before  you know classes start on the monday   mhh hmm  but actually i think maybe it might be a good idea  that way i'm sort of rested and relaxed and it'll force me it'll force me to have everything ready like by friday  maybe ya  i mean i mean i can get the camping stuff ready  would presqu'&icircumflex;le be too far   if we leave if we leave on the friday   see the problem is i mean you know i'm supposed to be working  until  well i'm supposed to be  again i mean i sorta sort of feel guilty  with the school at the school i only have a meeting we have a meeting on the seventeenth  now does that mean that i have to go in on the eighteenth also or do i then  what's on friday   you know the department meeting is on the wednesday  no department meeting's on the thursday is on the thursday from ten to twelve thirty  okay and then you feel you must show your face on friday   you know unclear words   i don't know  i don't know if i should  am i supposed to  uh you know is there stuff that i'm gonna going to  wanna want to do you know  or is it stuff that i could do  cos on the seventeenth what's gonna going to   happen on the seventeenth i think is that we're going to get our schedule  mhh hmm  uhm you know at which point i mean i'll be  i'll be sort of walking around and looking at the classrooms  where they are and and uhm and and we'll also ya and and from there also setting up i guess my office hours  finding out exactly how the how uhm how  the office hours work  i mean how many hou hours   you know are are you expected to be there for so many hours et pronounced " eck" cetera   et pronounced " eck" cetera you know  mhh hmm   sure  uhm where you where you'd have to work on a friday what's the earliest you think you could get away  oh i don't know  maybe maybe if i just go in in the morning and do things it's enough  mhh  you'd be free to roll at one o'clock  ya or maybe two or three  hmm  you know cos if we roll let's say roll at three   we're ready to go at three  and we wouldn't bother with the small  we'd stay on the four oh one major highway   we wouldn't bother with the small one   ya we'd just go straight down the four oh one  that means we should get there by   probably take like well three and a half hours for sure  cos it took about four hours to get  didn't it  but   is that all   what time did we leave   ya i think it took it took  about six and a half hours to get to sand banks but i think that's because we took we got off the four oh one and then from kingston to sand banks you go through that small road there  sure   remember and we had to wait for the ferry   to to go across  you know to get across that little river  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   ya  uhm and that i think that's why you know it sort of took   do you think it might be very busy  i mean we we'd we'd we'd get  there late at night  i don't know  we could call   ya if we leave at three we'd get there at seven let's say  mhh hmm  but i think then if that's what we're going to do we should probably call and and try and reserve a place  mhh hmm  you know you get there at seven o'clock at night are you gonna going to then if there's no room are you then gonna going to start  you know driving around to other uhm   well there is nothing else  three words   there is nothing else   that's it  there's nothing else in the area  because then you get off the four oh one then i mean we don't know how long we have to drive down from the four oh one to get   what kind of road is like  ya and what the road is like  it it won't be more than an hour  probably not  no  but we could do that  we could call  ya  i mean it does get uh it gets dark sooner   already towards the end of august  ya   you know it would be like  ya   but i don't know like i know we just went but   i i want to sort of feel like i've done something with the summer other than just work around the house you know  so you'd like to leave this weekend  well no i don't want to insist on this weekend  i just want to be sure it's done  i just want to be sure it happens   and puff how long are we gonna going to  put things off you know   ya   as far as that goes and what do you think i should do  should i just give no thoughts to uh employment until just you know the very tail end of august   you mean to work in the schoolboards  in in the schools going around to the schools   so you think it's just a case of   you think it's just wasted time   is it just wasted effort until uh puff   i i mean really if if  i didn't get anything in june it's just going to be last ditch  positions now   ya  but the thing i think would be interesting is to  call  well see that's what i have to do  i have to call the i have to call the uhm  uhm the the lavalle there the lavalle school board   cos they have to send me they haven't sent me the the sheet that you know your experience hours of hours of teaching  experience   but uhm   ya but but   what's what's it doing word    so i have to get that cough   excuse me  well because i'm thinking when i call them to ask to find out about that when i ask them  when i call them to find out about that   ya recording fault   as i was thinking when i call them to ask about that  form that they're supposed to have been supposed to be mailing me now uhm i can also ask them if the schools  like if if you know if the schools   are open  sort of like if the principals in the schools are already working  or the you know  mhh  if the if they're already in there it's probably better to go there to go to the schools   and talk to the principal  it'll probably be easier to talk to the principal if he's actually there  if they're actually in the school and not in some you know  uh meetings schoolboard-level meetings   but if they're actually in the schools it's probably better to go talk to them then wait till sort of till the teachers start working you know  and then the teachers are in the school and you've got all   that sort of confusion starting  mhh hmm mhh hmm   ya it's just that you know i mean   i mean if if you're the one  that's come and try you know that that   comes to it for the sake of dropping off a c v it's just ya  it's it seems like wasting their time and they give you such a cold shoulder  cough   no i don't think so  you don't think   i didn't feel that  the school where we did work there   uhm where we both fit  oh la rose ya   remember  i mean la rose actually got to us got to put uhm   invited us into his office and spoke to us briefly and told us that  he i think he isn't he the one that suggested that we should that what we should do is go up to each individual convenateur of each level   ya ya i know but  you know he was nice  i mean you know what ya we're begging for work but eh eh you're also offering a service  i'm here to offer my services in case  because by then a lot of principals might know if some of their teachers   uh you know as the the woman said there at the schoolboard all kinds of things happen can happen  over the over the summer right  i mean the teacher decides not to work again for whatever reason  has an accident  is sick  hmm  uhm so at the last minute they're stuck with like a full load to fill in   ya ya   you know it's it's just a matter of going in and saying you know hey i'm available if uh if  you need me  mhh hmm  uhm you know i've had this this this experience  ya  i'm willing to do this or not willing to that  or i guess maybe you shouldn't laugh say what you're willing or not willing to do  but on the other hand you know if i just   well if i contacted jackson   well for instance if if if janis  calls or the other woman calls and you know with her school where she does want to offer me something i think i should grab it  you know  but i i would go to the schools first   i would i would give the schools priority   hmm   ya but i mean that means waiting till october   no it means it means   doing something now   well   okay waiting till when  waiting till when
