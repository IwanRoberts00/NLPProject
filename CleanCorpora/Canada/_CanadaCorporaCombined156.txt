 madam speaker bill c thirty-seven falls far short of this goal  we as reformers will be supporting the bill however because it does do because it does do something about toughening up the system  something is better than nothing  but there are problems madam speaker  the government's proposed changes are merely cosmetic  they appear to give the act a smooth finish but when we look beneath the surface we can see serious structural flaws  here are some of the flaws  bill c thirty-seven does not lower the age limit  those young offenders who commit serious crimes and who  a who are under age twelve are still not held criminally responsible even though criminal acts are committed by children under age twelve   all we need to do is look at the newspaper today  they tell a harrowing tale about an aylmer boy who held his classmates at gunpoint  the boy had a three fifty-seven magnum and nine millimetre pistol  he was ten years old and apparently threatening the lives of his classmates  yet he has not been charged because he is too young  in nineteen ninety-three regina police were paralysed to act after a nine year old and an eleven year old attacked two young boys  the victims were forcibly confined beaten and sexually abused  police could do nothing  parliament has not given them any power to act  and so the stories could go on and we've heard many many of them repeated here in this house  young offenders like these should be included in our youth criminal justice so that they can receive treatment so they can learn that their crimes are not acceptable to society so we can be assured they do not reoffend and finally so that they can eventually become productive members of the community  we have the chance to reform the violent actions of these young children but we are missing this window of opportunity  madam speaker bill c thirty-seven also fails in another area  it softens the law for violent offenders under age sixteen  the amendments we are considering today will allow youth courts to deal more harshly with murderers  indeed canadians across the country have demanded that the current five-year maximum sentence is a slap on the wrist  the proposed changes will increase first degree murder sentences to ten years  in reality this translates to six years of custody and four years of community supervision  second degree murder sentences will be increased to a seven-year maximum  this translates into four years in custody and three years of supervision  i would argue that these changes will work to soften the law in its treatment of murderers  the slightly higher sentences will mean fewer violent offenders under sixteen will be transferred to adult court  the changes before us today will ensure that many murderers will remain under the young offenders act  the government argues that its amendments are sufficient  it says most of the murder-related cases heard in youth court are committed by sixteen and seventeen year olds  in nineteen ninety-two and ninety-three sixty per cent of the cases heard in youth court involved this age group  these statistics like the amendments before us today look good at first glance but once we look a little deeper we see the blemishes  the numbers completely ignore an important fact mister   madam speaker  offenders under age sixteen committed forty per cent of the murder cases heard in youth court at this time  i would argue this is a significant proportion  there is yet another flaw in these amendments madam speaker  the general public is kept in the dark about violent repeat offenders  the proposed changes will provide information on young offenders to the police to school officials and child welfare workers  certain members of society whose safety is in jeopardy will also receive information on the young offender   these seem like valid changes but in reality they are superficial  the general public does not have access to this information  madam speaker if certain members of the public can receive information about a young offender because there are their  safety is at risk why is the general public not also informed  if there is a change a a chance a young offender will reoffend then all of society is at risk  it is impossible for anyone to know for certain that only a targeted few will be in danger  if this government truly is interested in protecting all of society then all of society should be informed about dangerous young offenders   this is not the case  an additional flaw is that violent young offenders' records are not kept on file permanently  the proposals also claim to protect society by allowing police to keep the record of young offenders on file for ten years instead of five  according to the justice department this change will ensure that the length of time a young offender's record is kept is in keeping with the seriousness of the offence  madam speaker keeping the young offender's murder record on file for ten years does not begin to mirror mirror the seriousness of the offence   murder is permanent  it demands a permanent record   it is fair madam speaker that the victims' names and ordeals be forever etched in the minds of their loved ones long after the murder record has been wiped clean  madam speaker society has the right to know  if this government is truly interested in protecting society it should keep all murder records and violent crime crime   records on file permanently   c thirty-seven also raises some questions about serving sentences in the community   will the community sentences be adequate  under the changes set before us today more non-violent offenders will serve their sentences in the community instead of in custody  this change has many attributes  young offenders will not be influenced by harder violent offenders  often jail is considered a training ground for crime   it will save government money  it costs approximately seventy-five thousand dollars to incarcerate an individual  but the government in saving this money must be committed to redirecting some of it into the communities  if these offenders are to live in our communities we must ensure that they do not become repeat offenders  we must protect society  to do this some of these offenders may need treatment and we must ensure that they receive it  i am not talking about spending more money  i'm talking about saving money and spending some of it more wisely  in conclusion madam speaker i would like to say that when we make changes in to our criminal justice system we must ensure that the system is predictable to society  in order for a judicial system to act as an effective deterrent citizens must be able to anticipate the outcome of their actions  it is therefore important that the young offenders act mirror the adult system as accurately as possible  we still have a long way to go especially in the area of criminal  uh records and publication bans  i believe these changes before us today are a small step toward this goal  bill c thirty-seven is far from perfect but it will improve the current system somewhat  amendments to bill c thirty-seven are essential and i would urge my fellow members of parliament to ensure that these are enacted  thank you applause   questions and comments  the honourable member for saskatoon-dundurn  thank you madam speaker  madam speaker uhh mention has been made about uh the   the negative effect of increasing the sentencing uh and uh that this will result in fewer individuals being transferred to adult court  perhaps i can remind the member madam speaker that uh the onus is reversed   a person such as that is automatically in adult court and must be transferred down to youth court or the young offenders court in the case of serious offences such as murder  and as well madam speaker there is mention made of the aylmer incident yesterday but no mention is ever made no mention whatsoever about the father and the parents  and what about those guns  how did they get into the hands  were they in the hands of law abiding individuals  were they in the hands of neighbours  how did they get into the hands of the children  perhaps we should stop blaming the ten year old and start blaming the adults that allow these guns to get into the hands of uh young people  and there is a lot of rhetoric madam speaker about rehabilitation and productivity to society but no substance  so my question to the honourable mensch  honourable member is what would you do  how would you change it  what specific items would you put into the act to deter  to deal with rehabilitation and to make this young person  productive to society   the honourable member for red deer  uh madam speaker th th  there's a lot of things we could say that we would change  uh we could we could certainly take a look at things like boot camps and those sorts of things  but i think more important to your question uh we must include  victims' impact statements   we must include uh parents in the actual criminal justice system itself  the parents have got to be forced to be there to hear what that victim went through to hear what their little darling did to that person and then they have to be part if they're found to be in any way responsible they have to be part of that restitution that money that's paid back  that that fence that's fixed that uh whatever that damage has been  they've got to be part of that  so i agree with you fully  we must involve the parents in this  we must involve the victims in this  and when we do that  and i don't see that in bill c thirty-seven  i see just a wishy-washy bill that really just  just satisfies the red book liberal pary platform claim that we're going to make some changes but will do nothing to improve the actual situation we've got applause   honourable member for berthier-montcalm  french, 1 minute 20 seconds   the honourable member for red deer  madam speaker i i'm not quite sure exactly what the member is referring to but obviously what we're saying is we don't abandon those children  in fact we've got to do something about that rehabilitation  we're already spending millions of dollars uh on social programs on various types of retraining programs and it's not working  it's just not working  and so we have to take a look then  we have a bunch of academics who have this idealistic world  uhm where they can get solutions of where they think they have solutions but it's not working  we have to look at other things and uh that's  that's just the point  the money we're putting in there now is being wasted   resuming debate  the honourable  i'm sorry  we have one minute  uh time for a question from the honourable uh parliamentary secretary   he didn't want a question  alright  resuming debate   the honourable member for airy erie  mister maloney  no  the honourable parliamentary secretary to uh the government  french, 1 minute 20 seconds   extra-corpus speaker, 6 minutes, 15 seconds applause  there are no questions and comments after the uh   after five thirty-one  word resuming debate  french introduction   french, 7 minutes 10 seconds applause   uh resuming debate  the honourable member for london-middlesex  thank you very much madam speaker  it's my pleasure to join in this uh debate today on the young offenders act and a muchly a much-needed new bill to improve that act  first of all let me congratulate the honourable minister of justice for this bill  as i say madam speaker it offers to canadians as part of a two-step plan some interim improvements to the youth justice system in this country  i think it's important madam speaker that we we  all as members recognize and acknowledge that as i say this will be a two-step process  this is not the final and finished product if you will  if it were i would simply say to the honourable uh minister that it doesn't go far enough in the ultimate sense but for now it is a very good and major step in the right direction
