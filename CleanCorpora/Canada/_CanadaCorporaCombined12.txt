they been terribly terribly noisy  they've been quite noisy  they've been quite noisy have they   they uh they  played music ah sometimes quite late at night   and the bass comes through so that you think they're actually stamping on the floor but it's only the bass from the stereo  mm   it's it's rather annoying  wow that's awful   so have you had to phone them up in the night   sometimes   no i would tell the landlord downstairs who  tells them to turn it down   mm   so the landlord told me that uh he told them last year when they moved in that it was just for one year and then they're moving from downstairs up to the third  floor   mm hmm   oh i see   oh that's nice  so yeah  so you can look forward to peace and quiet cos they're  probably not   yes they're very quiet  oh isn't

really hard wood  it's really difficult too   well not only that but it all has dovetaily uh endings on it  nothing's nothing's glued   or or you know uh or stapled or  is there any actual wood-working to do on it or is it just a question of just mending it  no just the gluing of the chairs  i mean you don't wood-work antiques  no what i'm saying is is like is  is there broken wood

comment is good   so   word   so sentence   mm  should we look at uh fabric today  for what  a cover up  oh yeah yeah   i'm getting rid of that thing  yeah  word   it's   yeah   when it comes time to   you gonna going to  roll it up first  no i'm just gonna going to  throw it downstairs  you know how thick that thing is  it's an eight inch mattress  oh   it's eight inches  you don't roll up an eight inch double mattress easily   unless you've got hands the size of tractors and you can laugh  roll it over  mm hmm  but uh  i just want to get rid of it  it's long   getting rid of that mattress was  i should have done it a long time ago  and what i'm gonna going to do is  when i'm gonna going to   take the frame of that bed of that futon just put it downstairs in the locker store it and then when we move into a house then uh i just buy another mattress  mm   mm hmm  word you can get a a  nice thick mattress for a futon mattress for like a hundred dollars  and then we have we have a second bed like uh in a guest room or whatever you know  cos it's a nice frame   mm   a few words nice   it's a word frame  of course it's a nice frame  yeah   it's a very very nice frame  yawn i've got a lot to do still  i've got uh still quite a bit of packing to do  and uh i took i took basically everything off of the uh wall unit so that i can clean them down cos white wall units man every time i move i have to clean 'em  them   why are you cleaning it before we move  because uh   shouldn't you just clean it cos it  aren't they gonna going to get dirty when you move  no  what  no  no this is this is dirt that this is dust that's  settled in cos of the cos of the place is fairly dusty  dust that's that because there's a texture to the uh to the surface   you dust  mm   whenever you dust you dust once a week or whatever twice a week and uhm the dust is a sooty dust  and so it stays on  yeah to a certain extent there's like a little you can see where the books were against the back of the shelf you can see there's a line where it was covered by the books where it's cleaner you know and you know so it looks kinda kind of  stupid  mm hmm   hmm  and it's just not clean  i clean it all the time when i was uh when i was living my in in montreal last  i i cleaned them  i just scrubbed them down scrubbed down all the shelves  hmm  so it just looks nice and clean a few words    when i was unpack unpacking   i packed all my tapes today   packed all my tapes and i packed ah i packed  the paper towel roll and all that stuff   i packed my jewellery box   just like little the little  knick-knacks that could get lost in the scuffle  yeah   so i did that today   didn't do much else  oh then i went to darla's   she made this bean wicked bean salad whooh  did you bring any home with
