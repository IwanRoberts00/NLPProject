 what do you mean not taking this seriously  you're watching a movie you bring popcorn there's an association here  that's what i thought i'm like hey what's wrong but you know this and that and everything else   what'd she say  what could she possibly say  audible breath   unless the popcorn would distract the students so they wouldn't be able to watch the movie  i dunno don't know   meh it's kinda kind of cruddy anyway  i think they made a remake of it which was much better  the book was very good  uhh the book was quite good  clears throat i think u-two made a song on the with a drawn out 'eee' sound boy album or the war album the boy album  they did  it's called uhh tall trees long shadows or something  really  there's a song on one of the u-two albums that is one of the chapter names in lord of the flies  cos we were reading at the same time and a friend of mine   picked up the uh picked up the album and i went hey wait a minute here  oh yeah cool   that's cool  tall trees long shadows or ahh something like that  anyway uh what i wanted to say t about this is she was sitting there and nobody felt like answering it was in the mi i   don forget what the circumstances were but  breath she asked a question and just like nobody said anything  ebody everybody just sat there like  i couldn't care less snort   yeah  and uh she goes well do i have to do all the work for you i mean come on let's have some answers here throw something back at me  oh no  and i turned around to rahul and i  rahul you ever met rahul   no  anyway rahul was uh was   your your real good kid you know  never caused any ruckus never caused any fuss or anything  i turned around to rahul and i'm going uh how bout  about a brick laugh   and he started to laugh and ohh i got that boy in some trouble  he got a little bit of a little bit of a   sayin saying to right there  oh really  oh yeah  you got him into trouble  yeah i got him into trouble laugh starts fr  cos he started to laugh so loud laugh ends   i was sitting in front of him but i managed to you know  kinda kind of keep it quiet   but he started to laugh like hell and uh  ah that reminds me of danielle used to always make me laugh in math class sniff   god  ah yeah   i would sit in front of her and it was mrs  malone who hated me laugh   oh really   what're your teachers like in st gerard unnatural pause, almost 10 seconds   audible breath what are they like  uhhm another unnatural pause, 4-5 seconds   it's a general question you know so like what were they like  were they really strict were there some of them that were  kinda kind of cool you know were they you know  some of them were kinda kind of  cool but i mean they had they had a protocol that they had to follow  ah okay  when i you know when we when they  walked into a room when they walked into a classroom we had to stand up  okay  and you couldn't not stand up and if you didn't you would be punished or you would whatever  you would be told look stand up ladies hello i'm here  you know and you had to st like they had to follow certain protocols or something had to  dress a certain way  uh huh clears throat   uhh so they you know they were told to maintain a certain   decorum   th i mean   in the classroom   yeah so i mean there was just in terms of the the strictness  but you can't point that out against any teacher because it was whether they agreed with it or not it's what they had to do   yeah  member i remember when mr novak  came in our geography teacher sniff   ah man poor guy   but he came in from a public school   yeah  and uh   anyway so for him it was like night and day you know i mean  yeah   at one point when you know we'd been bad right because  there was just there had been just too much talking in the study hall at one point and so we were like severely reprimanded right  sniff   and when mrs   oh god   like the whole cl the whole school  had to come in and for like a i dunno don't know  twenty-minute sit in of being super quiet for punishment sniff  laugh   hey sto   but i mean that's the way it was right i mean you have to  understand that's the way it was   that's yeah yeah   and uhh and so when mr novak   and of course all the faculty finds out that the kids and the students are in trouble  and mr novak found out the kids're in trouble you know they did something bad and mr novak 's like well were desks thrown out the window you know  laugh   uhh well did anyone jump out did you know  what happened something set on fire  it's like no no no they were being loud in study hall and he's like  that's it you know like  that's it you fools  so for him he was like telling us how it was just such a  you know like i mean of course in real life it's so silly but it's the way it was you know  yeah   whatever it gave a certain discipline i suppose  breath   or they tried to instill that in us i mean it's so  that's why when i got to school when you do  i think in general you get to secondary five you've kind of   you see b you realize all these stupid things are like irrelevant sort of thing  i mean you kind of realize i supppose their point to what they did  they instill something in you but  mm hmm  you realize that being quiet in study hall or whatev  like that kinda kind of punishment was just stupid you know it's not gonna going to get you anywhere  you have to really been bad it just you know what i mean  and so sort of a   start whisper but anyway end whisper   so mrs ma mal malone  oh my math teacher  so danielle was sittin sitting  back of me and she hates uh m   so mrs i think mrs malone  hated us cos we were wiseasses  laugh   and  ah ya you smartass people  laugh and uh and  danielle hated mrs malone and anyway and i was just sort of like  she was a good math teacher though i'll give her that she was a good math teacher but on a personality level we didn't  okay   yeah cos there's i  betcha bet you that some people that can go with the flow sort of like what they're  sposed supposed to do   you know   she tried to revel in the fact that she had the power over you  oh yeah  but i mean she was a good math teacher and that's all that counted  but anyway danielle couldn't stand her sniff   okay  so danielle oh it was just like classic when she when she came in class she was she kind of  she had this paper but she got this habit into  wearing dangling a paperclip off her lips   kinda kind of like a cigarette you know   who   it was just barely hangin  hanging there  just a paperclip a coloured paperclip   who was this   danielle   okay   danielle   danielle was just back of me  yeah  she had this paperclip in her mouth and then w mrs  malone would be talking whatever and danielle would crack these wiseass comments  laugh and of course you're the only one to hear them  i'm the only  she's like she's talking to me she's just looking  at mrs malone and she's talking just sort of through her lips like that spoken in the manner mentioned   uh huh  and she'd just and she'd say  something and i was like stifled laugh   it's the same thing as through through   your lips it was like how bout about   a brick you know sort of thing like that   speaking through her lips yeah   word really and she but she'd   sorta sort of talk like that and she had the paperclip there and she'd laugh like hu hu hu huh stops talking through her lips   laugh she's like she was like beavis   you should have seen her laughing right   she was just looking straight ahead she had this like fixed facial expression with the thing hangin hanging  out of her and she's like speaking through lips  howtabrick how about a brick you know and then i'd be like  pretending to stifle a laugh and then she'd be like hu hu hu huh  and then who'd get in trouble right me laugh   laugh   you obviously   so i got threatened one day that i'd be kicked  breath   you one day one day evie tsk i predict that you will get kicked out of c&eacute;gep two-year program completed after highschool for post-secondary preparation laugh   three or four words i'll get kicked   kicked out of a c&eacute;gep math class  out of c&eacute;gep   don't ask me why  i just kinda kind of looked at her and went uh huh do you laugh   you gotta got to be pretty bad to get kicked out of a c&eacute;gep math class don't you >  laugh just sort of like la la it was sort of an irrelevant strep   it was just so funny you know th   every so often danielle and breath   later on like months later would just sit by and she goes   starts talking through her lips i predict laugh   and of course then of course i start laughing again   long cackling laugh did she say this  in front of everybody   n no it was just like  they w these're quiet comments to me  oh no no no i mean did she say this yo uh  sh i predict that   oh it was in front of everyone yeah  oh really  yeah  well i predict that you're probly probably  right   i was just sort of like okay whatever  laugh   well we'll see i guess   indifference total indifference  well what do you want me to what do you say  to that like it's not really that ba   you know it's just sort of like okay laugh   mm hmm   anyway so and i know the   anyway just start laugh you feel like you're end laugh getting in trouble when you're laughing at someone laugh   cos the joke that someone else made  mm hmm  i remember the one time in english class cos   w i we'd always sit up front  mm hmm  second row up front  yeah  anyway cos we couldn't really get in trouble there  cos cos they wouldn't check you out they wouldn't keep a close eye on you if you were in the second row because they figure you were too close to do anything mischievous so they were scopin  scoping out the back row all the morons who wanna  want to sit in the back to keep outta out of the teacher's attention  okay   laugh   that's what they were always scopin  scoping for the trouble makers you know  uh huh   so me and danielle would get away with everything up front you know laugh   really  it's that selective view  front and centre bang  so th is tha     yeah   selective view it's  and i just remember once it was just so i don't think i can explain it to you but it we laughed so  and i it was in uh oh like did you ever have the books called the wordly wise   mmm   they were english books it's just to increase your vocabulary right so you had this list of new words you had to learn  you had to look up the words in the dictionary then you had to use these words in sentences and all that kin you know that crap  mkay okay   just to learn sniff new words  yeah  and one of the words i don't know what it had to do it had to do with   so mrs malo mrs stockman  who actually knows kevin boers very well at the restaurant but   sort of ve you know she's an english t and sort of into drama and very theatrical and she was like  and this one word had to do with sort of something to do with medieval times maybe in swordfights or something  so she was acting out this whole swordfight or something and me and danielle are just crackin cracking  just these stupid comments you know   snort   and i'm going start whisper oh can you imagine you know they the guy sort of you know  they're like the guy   like for example they're having a swordfight and one guy's not looking what he's doing and he accidentally lobs off the head of his opponent right  uh huh  a and it was i  dunno don't know how that came up and i was like ah wouldn't that be funny and then danielle just goes yeah and then the  gu and then have a nice day the teacher goes have a nice day   and then from and then for some  reason it was just too funny  it was like we just started laughing like  five or six words but we had to be quiet
