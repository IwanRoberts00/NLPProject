three this time  thirty   lots of guys  how are you going to do all that marking over christmas this year with the wedding on  it's gonna going to be tough    i know  how many guys  three  no no many more  i think about twelve   about a third of your group  mhh hmm  a little more  that's good  and all in that whole class all  except one is working   isn't that extraordinary   really   are they are they working in that field  all except one of them are working word    no uhh no  they're most of them are in  service  just at jobs   o one guy   a couple of guys in uh uh working in  consumer's distributors and uh you know handling parcels and boxes and things  but most of them are in banks or in in   uh trust companies on the front line  service service service  mhh   so they're really interested in some of these things   uhm almost all are involved in or want have i was involved in human resource management word    mhh hmm   hmm  but really quite an interesting group  i've just got one one kid looks like a bit of a pain  who wants you know to me to show him exactly which parts of the notes he should be studying for the exams i  gotten   i'm just gonna going to  to say there no laugh i'm not prepared to do that  isn't that a word   wants to meet with me next week for an hour  i said that's fine i'll be happy to meet with you a  any questions but i will not show you what to study  what's the word on the uh crazy guy who threatened you   no nothing more   you've never heard any more  no  do you know if he's out or  he's out  he's out  ya   well he wouldn't find me now probably   ya   he's definitely out  oh there's a new lawyer at the university now too  working with sam doing the uh h r stuff   all of the uhm personnel law or whatever you call  it labour relations law  ya   ya  and she's doing some of the c s s t commission de la sant&eacute; et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; du travail legal stuff  which is very good  i'm pleased  huh  she seems to be excellent  sian sian 's  impressed with her  so is colleen   and how is rachel making out  mhh not so great   she seems to have a vitamin b twelve problem on top of everything else  hmm  but her lupus seems to be more or less under control  she's working at home but she's getting anxious that contracts aren't coming as fast as she'd like them   that's the problem with being an consultant  but i think that's her niche  uhh when she eventually gets to be known  mhh hmm   but it it it does take time and i guess she's impatient  it's understandable but i guess she is  oh she's just anxious  ya  security they don't she doesn't  have any  you see that's the problem  just what she what she can earn  mhh hmm  but she's got a few fairly stable contracts but uh   we've got to get her over one point soon   one thing i did while i was away i sent uh a  a list of my questions for my exam down to the examiner  when did you have time to do that  oh i did  i did when was visiting at saturday afternoons i felt i wasn't taking time for  nobody was doing anything then so i worked on the questions and   i i uhm i uh faxed them down to him about  ten days ago  they have a fax there  no  they do but he can't use it  the i i there was a uh little printer's shop in in the town that had a   a fax machine  so i faxed it down to him about ten days ago  uh i i just told him that   in the in the letter that i'd really like to try and write that exam by the end of this month   man are you moving after all this  diddling  around   ya   i'd like to get it done  wow  but there's no there's no   use uh uh de   de de delaying   anymore   there's no point de delaying    no   they're going to kick you out of the program   i know as i know as   i know as much as uh as   i will ever know about uh  you gotta have got to do something   buddhism and  ya well about the co uh the   uh  you know i mean any more reading i do is just redundant  mhh hmm   now which which one is this one you're  gonna going to be doing  which  this is the one on uh buddhism and uh   it's on buddhism and voluntary death in other words  you're doing an exam on that   ya  oh   in other words it will include buddhist attitudes towards  uhh abortion uh suicide and euthanasia   mhh hmm   and like all you know i mean they their   the the religion   by by its teaching proscibes any of those but they're very much a part of japanese buddhist culture   well for sure   you think of the kamikaze pilots and  and   but where does that come from  there must be another influence that   well they they uhh they're  they're able  for example the intention with which you uh commit suicide is extremely important to them   and if you are totally non - self-absorbed your intention is focused upon service to the emperor or service to the uh uhm uhm   w whatever then uh then  it's not really considered suicide  remember those uh   a sacrifice  it's a sacrifice uhh for a higher purpose  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  remember those uhm vietnamese monks who  burned themselves in  the viet viet   vietnam war   mhh hmm   that's right   that wasn't suicide  that's not sui suicide     that was sacrifice   they don't they don't  term it as sacrifice   it's martyrdom or sacri  sacrifice sacri   sacrifice   it's a it's a   drawing attention   it's more of a sacrifice isn't it   ya it's more a sacrifice   ya   they're drawing attention to an issue which is not just theirs  it's it's it's global or   or   uh you know the people of vietnam in that particular situation were the ones who   uh they wanted to draw the attention of the world to the suffering of the uh vietnamese people   so the intention   in fact for any uh buddhist the the uh i mean the practising ones the intention at your time   what's what's in your mind at the time of your death whether it's even natural causes is extremely important  because
