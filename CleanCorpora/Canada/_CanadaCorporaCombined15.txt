 it really can't  laugh it can't be the centre but you're right that  you can't have  well i have a girlfriend who is always telling me i have to make up a list you see if you don't make up a list of exactly what you want then you can't expect to find exactly what you want  and i was laughing with chloe about this because i had i was allowed ten points you see on my list  and i and uhm wonderful sexual relations happened to come up number eight on the list  and of course we had a good chuckle because it showed changing priorities  and i was actually i laughed when i saw it at number eight too  but uhm ya of course it's very very important but uhm being able to communicate and having shared values and shared goals and all those other things are very important as well  you know one amazing things is that uh after that after chloe's book uh smouldering rock  came out uh with all the family secrets and uh and uh traumas of the old days and her uncle's case and her father's case and her grandmother's case and uh family's are still  incredibly involved with secrets and you will never know the secrets  of my life with kim never  nor would i want to  why not you'll words   laugh well laugh   everything is always grist for the writer's mill   laugh   come on you're a writer   laugh okay yes well i suppose  so this book i told you about uhm about this journalist friend i have in b c british columbia   cough   i think he ah as i explained to you was adopted and  and found the roots of his family  there was one line in the book that has stayed with me  it just resonated  it was towards the end he had found his family had established ah some good ties with some siblings et cetera and uh some tragedies  came not long after his uh finding a family and the sentence that really rang for me was he said i've discovered that finding family ultimately means losing the family   and it was an aspect that you hadn't thought about when you first picked up the book  you just though of here's someone's dream coming true finding his true-blood siblings his ah his uh blood  parents and he did  and in some cases the scenarios worked out well and others not so well but his joy was almost immediately snatched by uh some tragedies  and it made me wonder what sort of victory that was for him  i mean it it's a regular victory  he's experiencing now what everyone else would if they were close to their families  uh tragedies do happen  he lost a nephew was basically what happened uh from suicide  uh but then he was at that point starting to become close to the sister so was able to give her comfort and uh   but it the line really stayed with me  well it cough it's  probably got to do with this whole business of  of the newness of of  perfection that surrounds families  anyways  the waltons  well they're supposed to be uh parents are supposed to be just and kind and truthful honest and  unselfish and and forever the same  they're not  george bernard shaw said well love is a words  laugh words his parents   laugh   and uhh you can't have that  and and in in  families that they exist i think with most children they word in their lifetime the lifetime of the parents anyway that disappointment that their parents weren't better then they were more understanding more loving more unselfish  and uhh that's the name of the game  you know we're we are we are   not saints we're only human  and uh which you know the the man who who rediscovered his his long-lost parents you know has   they're not ideal they're just ordinary human beings you know fallible bungled beings like the other human being but you don't expect that  i know in fact he was quite horrified by uhm some of the  attitudes he heard his mother express and he tried to be fair in that assessment considering her environment and upbringing and so forth  but he hoped for more of a sympatico exchange which didn't happen  well maybe you know i think the reason why i you and i are able to communicate is the fact that cough as well as we do is the fact that for the last twenty-five years we shared the best of each other through correspondence and through occasional visits and very little of the ugly very little of the nasty very little of the temper very little of the rage  i haven't seen it in you and you haven't seen very much of it in me so we're able to perpetuate that myth  that's very nice for me you know   laugh   anne-marie is sweetness and light and maxwell is  the rising and respected father of the world  that's right that's right you've got it that's right that's right  ya you don't uh you don't have many of those uh failings that uh parents are so frightened of in  in perceiving in their children mhhm  that's nice to know that's your perception laugh    laugh that's right that's right  you know you're always happy you're always joyous you always like to laugh and uh i don't see you in despair  that's fine with me laugh   come on anne come on come on  only my dog does  only my dog knows for sure laugh   you know i i wonder though you you're it seems as though you're presenting the idea that  our closeness or enjoyment at one another's company is somewhat based on the fact we haven't seen the uglier or sadder or more difficult times  i wonder how things would be different if we had been able to support and uh be there for one another during those times  it would be a a different sort of  ahh fabric  well i mean that's that's one of the big things which you know is unresolved in your uh emotional life  uh that is the i was gonna going to  say sense but the conviction that you were abandoned you were abandoned by your father abandoned by your older sister  you were even abandoned by your sister who was so malicious and who died  uhm eventually abandoned by your brother laugh   laugh ya i was gonna  going to say don't forget johnny   laugh the bastard moved not just a province away but a country away  and he knows you said that i i  couldn't help thinking of the time uh his mother kicked him out  laugh when he was fourteen years of age and he landed in salt spring  and he went to salt spring   he landed with me and i decided to uh cough help instruct him  but there was this strange guy who'd suffered a broken neck and lived in the cabin beside me and he had studied m   marine biology at some american university and he was   a a dope-smokin' hippy you know until he recovered from the broken neck  and uh uhh i decided that johnny had to learn about   my marine biology with this guy   laugh   get him up at four o'clock in the morning and he'd go down and lay laugh word the marine life was at the rocky edges of salt spring island you know off the georgia straits  laugh   oh god poor johnny   isn't it terrible  i can't see it being a terrible thing  besides they were probably enjoying themselves having the odd puff or two  yes ya  i'd go to vancouver and do my writing for the week and i'd come back with loaded down with groceries laugh  and that kid you know just left me on that island laugh by himself  what did you do  i don't know  laugh he probably read  he had a girl he had a girl so  at fourteen  well not not that that's particularly surprising laugh it's just it wasn't his home turf right  you know he had a girl one of those girls who had long hair and long diaphanous skirts you know who's word    oh ya the kind of words standing from the summer laugh   that's right that's right  lady word   and uh don't know where she came from  but he found her you know   mhhm he really did  yes  and uh i always remember the clam chowder a big cup  of   i remember you making that  it's word   it was > really good although i didn't uhm quite have a word taste for seafood at that time but i remember watching you make it  and the house smelled tangy with tomatoes and onions and celery  do you remember that cottage  yes i do yes i do  i remember the enclosed veranda the screened  veranda and uhh i remember the the   there's a step down to the kitchen  oh gosh you know what i'm getting confused with uhm the cabin at rosso  uhm was there a step down to the kitchen no okay then i am getting confused  but i remember the veranda very clearly and that it was up a little bit on a hillside and word it was very cool so there mu must it must have been it was surrounded by the trees quite heavily and  laugh   what  no na word a bit lazy there  you had this uh this huge fireplace which i burnt out by the way and just built the fire so high that it  ruined the fire-brick but i had some ex american marine  middle-aged guy who used to cut wood for me  and burnt eight cords of wood in that goddamn fireplace in the wintertime eight cords  cheap wood too  big strong guy  i think he used to build uh ya he used to build airstrips on laugh pacific islands you know   words   words   ya ya  how long did johnny stay over there with you   there's not enough for me to write  cough i can't remember not very long   hmmh   he got bushed  laugh   i'm very relaxed actually  i don't consider it you know he dropped out of school and all that sort of business   and uh that's where i taught him how to drive  that's what i recall  you had some bit of a car didn't you  i had a nineteen fifty-seven deluxe four-door   pontiac two-  tone   ya   uhh but woo laugh   power this and power that   yaa it was registered to some mythical guy who'd long since disappeared and it was insured with him but the ownership was very shaky i remember that  it came to me because uh gerry fister took off to england and left the car there and gave it to me and well what a beautiful built car  it had four speakers in it  can you imagine a fifty-seven car  whoa  he put it in the ditch johnny put it in the ditch  uhh but i taught him how to drive   cough ya i say good teacher   laugh   he did that by himself   words laugh   ya ya ya > ya  and he ended up being a good teacher   he lent me that big boat that he had the biscayne  and that was one of the first years he went tree-planting  and when he came back he said uh what are these dings doing on here  i said what dings  i said those were there laugh before you left  and he said no no i'll show you the ones that were there before i left and of course they had the rust patches and so forth and words  mine had rust patches so i had to say oh well perhaps that is new  but that was a fun car  we had we lost the brakes one time when he and i uh went camping with alex and ron   we went up to   with who  alex and ron   yes  and we took a camping trip up to nelson and uhm  who who is ron   ron michealson   oh yes  and uh so the four of us loaded all our gear into that big car and on the way coming home there's i can't remember if it's coming in to nelson or leaving nelson there's   an an enormous hill and uh we basically lost the brakes
