 ya   cough   and amelie is well she's not as she's less  flaky now   flaky now   ya she's making more sense  ya  i think it's cos once she gets to know you she sort of like stops with the act  ya  it's just an act eh the flakiness  is it   ya  you think so  ya   why would anyone want to put on an act to do that   a few words i don't know but   it's a total act  like when she first met us that's a total act   like that fake laugh giggling and oh what are you doing in that little baby voice and all that stuff that's not her  you saw how she was  ya  about four words   she made sense talked intelligent had an opinion that made sense you know   ya   i don't know she was acting  laugh she was acting pretty crazy in in   the the room  when i was cutting my hair   i don't wanna want to be the first   really i thought a few words   when you were all sitting around here  ya she was being kind of normal but i i   like after the haircut like you know come  o on she was g she was   really upset  three or four words   she goes okay  she goes i won't go home and cry i promise  she's just joking word   no   ya   ya  rock says she has a real dry sense of humour  yawn you don't know that she's joking  but i'm sure she was just kidding  no she really wasn't  she was going it's so short  she was like being very serious  she not 'she's' going it's so short i'm not used to it  she goes  cos she told me the whole story  she goes the last time this uh i got my hair cut this guy butchered my hair and i went home and cried  she goes i was so upset  i said how short did they cut it  she said well it was like to the middle of my back  and i said like it is now  like i j you know like i just  cut it   and she goes you you left it a little bit longer like that  and i was like uh you know i made sure this this   like that was want she wanted   right  but uh   like i say i think she's just  no she wasn't joking joe   you don't think so eh   no i know so   i know so   anyways i thought she made more sense  ya she did  like i like her i like her more  you know what it is she's nicer when she's not around  rock   ya way nicer  when she's around rock she turns into   like sometimes   like at first when i met her i didn't like her to tell you the truth  and and on that first day i was   like what does she  expect and then by the end of the week  it was like okay well she sorta sort of  loosened up a  bit word when we went to his parents  well neither did i  i was so sick of her   ya  mhh   ya   ya   and then as i got to know her i was okay she's not so bad  i liked her right away laugh   ya when she was over here i though ah she's okay you know   a few words   she was like actually making intelligent comments you know  instead of going into the ahh  wahh she turns into a whiny sort of dingbat sometimes and oh la la la la you know  and puts on that little baby face like  poor me i'm just so stupid i  don't understand   no i liked her right away   i thought she's uh   ya   she plays helpless   she's too   laugh   no she does that  she does that  i think she does that more around men for some reason or something   phrase   ya like   like she doesn't do it as much around me and she  was always nice she was nice to me like   like a few words on thursday  maybe two words like a whole new person  ya   ya  but around rock she does it and she's always mad at him for something   about four words   she's constantly pissed off at him  ya yawn ya that only does one thing though  like that's going to make him callous to a point where now he's even like and joe even said it like he goes ya i've come to a point now where i've accepted that she's always mad at me so it's just like the norm now  so   he doesn't check his behaviour all the time  he's just like whatever i do what's logical and you know she deals with it and i don't get all  cos he used to get all upset when she'd be like oh rock  la la la la you know and he'd try to make it better and nothing works you know  he realized that now so  mhh hmm  whatever   cough whatever  he just accepts the fact that she you know she's  off her off her mark on that one you know   off her rocker   ya   so it doesn't work  if you're always mad it doesn't work   so we gonna going to dress up tomorrow and uh stand at the two words  a few words   ya   i'm gonna going to go as uh  you'll put some rope on me there and fray the ends of the rope and tie it all in knots and you could do the same thing except put like uh sewing needles on yourself and everything  and what are you gonna going to   be   what are you supposed to be  i'll be a frayed knot as in " afraid not"   and you'll be a and you'll be a  frayed sew as in " afraid so"   laugh   laugh where did you get that from  laugh you'll be a frayed sew and i'll be a frayed knot  ahh  what do you think  sounds good to me  okay  where'd you get that from  reed who else   did he get that in his book  no in his head  no  ya  really  reed ya not too much goes on up there just bizarre things  laugh a frayed not and a frayed sew   a frayed not and a frayed sew   our poor neighbours downstairs must have gone crazy today  ya they must hate it that the summer's over and we're home every weekend inviting our family members over stomping around  laugh i know   bang bang bang  well at least it's not very often  ya once every month  ya   it's not so bad   will this go off automatically   no  we have to uh time it   ya  well i guess that's enough for now   i might get ready for bed  i'm pretty tired  ya me too  i feel like there's something i should be doing  what do you mean that you forgot to do  did you do all your estimates  no i didn't do them  i have no energy to start calculating now  did you d ever do mrs uhh what's her name the lady that kept on calling there  oh ya ya sure  you handed it to her  and there's that man that you said you were going to do in the springtime  oh ya i gotta have got to go visit him this week  oh you haven't been there  no  i keep telling these people look i'm booked till january you know at least and maybe till march you know   it looks like march anyway if this lady signs  so like what the fuck you know  what am i going to do okay i'm gonna going to  rush over there and give you an estimate for some work that i can do in uhh half a year two word thing   well they probably want an estimate like from a couple of people and then they can   ya well that's it so waste my time you know  ya well it's like that woman   a few words i'd rather find out   are you are you willing to wait for me   you know   well the thing is is     and then ya but in the meanwhile mrs  buchanan or whatever said the same thing well just give me an estimate just give me an  phrase   and now she's taking you  she's going with you isn't she  no she says well if we don't find anyone else i guess we're going to have to wait till spring word is what she said  but it's a lot of work to drive out someplace spend a few hours with them and then and then come back figure it out ya figure out  write it all out   i thought that was pretty weird sort of like expecting you to do that   but she said it out loud  like she said it to me and uhm i know she said it to you too she goes well if you can't do it that's okay but i just want another estimate so i can compare it  it's like what do ya you just want to waste his time   ya you want to waste my time ya  exactly  that's how i feel  so you know that's why like all these estimates i'm doing is like ya well uh can you wait six months you know or can you wait  most people would say well it's a little ridiculous to wait half a year  ya   i'll go find someone else  like this guy he said okay i'll wait till spring should i book you now ya  oh ya   now two words   so now you know he's serious  now i go see him   and like this one this basement i'm gonna going to do for annette wynn cough uh i don't like  that working for her that much laugh    annette wynn   ya  i didn't work for her before so  why  i don't know she's  she's not very nice  no just sorta sort of like alway's trying to bargain ya you and  you're always bargaining and negotiating every little thing and  oh really   oh ya  it's like this is the hourly rate it's twenty-five bucks an hour you pay the materials you know and that's the end of it  she's firm   you wanna want to count my hours you watch me  oh is that what they do  that's what i'm gonna going to do  ohh   you know she last time i   did it i had to have one price for the whole job you know and she bargains when she gets the price and then when it's come time to pay she bargains again you know  but you don't give in do you  no but it's still a pain you know   ya   it's like oh now we have to go through everything and okay and this cost me that add it up  so this way you collect it at the end of the week  type of thing   ya so ya exa i look i did you know whatever forty hours that's a thousand dollars   here are my hours  she made me buy all of my material  that's the person you were talking about last week  at the dinner table  ya   ya ya  that's three or four words   ya when jenny and anna don't feel like  anyway i'd rather do another job somewhere else but  well it's sort of good because you can make good money when you do it that way because then you don't have to estimate anything  you don't have to estimate  well just like working for for them it's like they're nice and everything you just   i don't know a bit of a pain  you know what i just realized right  it's gonna going to be hanukkah soon  what   you gotta have got to get cracking on buying gifts for the kids and stuff   yaa cracking   you know how much money we spent or i spent  on  this dinner   well i   this one   how much  about sixty bucks at least  ya   like imagine how much yawn how much   uh i'm falling asleep  how much jen spends everytime  oh i know but they have the money   two words comes home  well they have the money but still you know when it's our turn it's our turn  i know  i feel like  i was glad they they brought wine  i'm glad we didn't buy any   ya see ya i knew it  ya  we had all the ceasers and beer and stuff like that which was okay  ya i didn't think we had beer  we got so much beer it's ridiculous  oh i have i put we even have   st ambroses left over from our party from last may or whenever  maybe two words
