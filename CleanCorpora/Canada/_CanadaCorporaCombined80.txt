 so you have to find a place in yourself that just says they're doing what they're doing like ugh  ya  even billy's talking about it  ya  that's really funny because yesterday when we were  walking around the gallery i started to think about okay  brian's dad died when he was sixty   yesterday afternoon i was walking around the gallery and i was thinking about okay so brian's forty two so that would give  eight years  eight years  and i started freaking out  oh no eighteen years  and then i thought like  it it's like if he's gonna  going to live that way and he's gonna  going to stress himself that way and   he reads all these things about heart disease and stuff but he still does all the stuff right it's like i'm not   y'know you know   laugh   so now my only concern is that he's old he's   he's uh alive long enough for cory like   if there isn't anything else going on in his life that he figures is worth taking care of himself for well y'know  you know   well what a crisis too eh  when uh you realize how close you are to the age of uh  y'know you know your father dying  oh   it seems that is that the natural uh  y'know you know death time for your family  ya   mhh hmm  uhm   margaret and jim they're going through something now  mhh mmm   he's just turned fifty   just last month he had his fiftieth uh birthday   now his dad died when he was tommy's age   so they're basically living with   oh when he was word sick  ya sorry ya ya   three or four words  laugh   sorry   laugh   hm no he wasn't seventeen sixteen when he died  but uh they're really afraid now that jim's  gonna going to die   and it's a constant worry for my sister   oh so that's why she wanted to your place for a vacation  ya ya   so she's always worried about that but y  you think about it and uh   she's a worry wort eh  she very much of a worry wort ya   exhale   but the other thing that is also v   for me very shocking to think y i uh seniors right  seniors are start getting classified as seniors as at fifty   fifty plus clubs   and it's like ahhhhh  that's really soon   a senior  we're we're we're starting to edge into that senior's category   i don't call it that  i just call it croneward bound   laugh   i mean i y'know you know   like i love that whole concept of the crone  laugh   which really pisses me off that they don't have a word for it in french  i mean can you believe that we live in a soc   we live in a society that doesn't have a word for  for wise woman like for crone  i mean it's such a wonderful concept  mhh hmm   ya  and uh i i think that that's where we're going us  but there's this   well   i can't consider men  i think they're so underdeveloped anyways  they all stop at fifteen anyways so  well there's the intellectual side of it but there's a physical side of it  but   i mean once you once you reach your mid forties uh your body starts falling apart  there's no two ways about it   y'know you know you can do what you what you can to keep it together and some of us not me are more a apt at it than   others but   laugh   but uh y'know you know   y you can't you can't help it  and especially women because you go through a specific menopause  that changes your your physical body and your mind might be functioning fine or you may still be growing there but your body is stopping you from doing things and it's  it's very hard to keep on top of things  mhh hmm   but use your body   but you better do everything you can with your mind because you've had forty years to get it together to not be bitter  and to be able to age with not grace how you look from the outside but to have this inner kind of place you really are happy to be  it's not a matter of being bitter  it's a matter of being frustrated because your mind is going some place   right well whatever   a and your body can't do it   well is your mind gonna going to   go some place   for sure  i would think so  well not at fifty   no go no go go   some place good i don't mean go some place bad  i don't mean deteriorate  mhm   i mean that you're still learning  you're still y'know you know   oh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   i still wanna want to go to school  i still wanna want to learn  i still wanna want to do things  y'know you know   but your min your your body   uh stops you  it either stops you in terms of the amount of energy that you have to expe expend or   i it becomes difficult   mhh hmm   and uhm just that reality watching uh  y'know you know either my family or brian  talking about his his dad dying at sixty  well that's not so far off anymore eh it's just  two words ya   eighteen years   ya   eighteen years is a very long time   is it   it's not to me  i mean having a having a son who's uh  turning seventeen that went through like the blink of an eye   it's like buzzap it's gone   it seems like yesterday he was   no but you work like how many years   thirteen years at the cit now  thirteen years at the city of montreal   that wasn't the blink of an eye   ya   well it was and it wasn't  i mean the last couple of years were i guess uh longer  laugh than the others just because of the drudgery but one   when you're in the middle of it when you're stimulated by it when you're having a good time as it was in the beginning  it went by very quickly y'know you know   mhh hmm   but it's just laterwhen things become a dirge that   it uh they extend longer than they seem to   mhh but   well i think point of view really has a lot to do with how you handle that and how you and what kind of energy you put into every decision you make daily   ya   because you're building  i mean at this point we're supposed to we are  old enough and we have it figured out enough that you're building on top of something and   your ju you your  decisions that you make fold fold in on themselves and create your reality right  so like every decision you make like   sure   ya for sure  but your cons but your  conscious decisions are are diminished a lot when you're uh in a very heavy working situation because you're just going with the momentum  in various relationships   ya  and even though y'know you know   when you stop when you consciously stop and try and decide what you're  gonna going to do well you can make an effort to get from point a to point b but normally just the momentum of life just throws you along and you really can't do too much about it  you just have to keep going y'know you know     and uh that's uh uh that's for me like this s  sixteen years has just flown by  so to see and it seems as i'm getting older the years go by quicker   and uhm i think it just seems that sixty's  gonna going to come really quickly y'know  you know   so are you concerned about money  oh for sure  for sure because neither matt nor i have any kind of uh stable uh savings or pension or whatever  we we've made this investment in a home late in life   y'know you know mortgages real estate all that kind of stuff  that's all new to us  we're we're investing much later than  most people most families do   so we're starting at an age we're investing at an age in those kinds of things when we we  should really be seriously investing in money to live on  mhh hmm  because we don't have pensions  we don't have uh any kind of job y'know  you know both being in g i  i jobs that are uh uh self-employed by nature that y'know you know   you just you can't do much about it   but you could do them forever like unless your hands become terribly arthritic or something like that and bill's  hands   mhh hmm   ya well definitely y'know you know  definitely   but uh but still there's still   i it takes you a long time to accumulate  so   and ah let's face it at some point he's gonna  going to wanna want to slow down too  he's teaching  he's teaching a lot now but at some point he's gonna   going to wanna want to   want to do other things that are more stimulating  i mean he wants to play but he doesn't get y'know  you know he just can't stop  like he's he's caught up in the   mome momentum right now   mhm mhm   he has to keep doing what he's doing   and he's aged a lot in the last   have you noticed how much he's aged in the last year   no  oh phenomenal   it's phenomenal how much he's aged   no i honestly haven't and i mean i do look at him because everybody's always telling me how gorgeous he his and it's like i look at him two words like   one or two words   laugh   no to me he still looks as he still looks like when he was eighteen  uh well he his he still looks very young but the to me it's shocking   from when we st   uh y'know you know obviously the pressure of the house all the stuff everything uh even turning forty five at the same time whatever he he's aged an awful lot   his uh his skin his hair his eyes  the glu y'know you know the  glu the kind of film   not it's not a film but they're not as bright as they were  oh ya   laugh get out the sunglasses  laugh   oh ya  he's aged a lot   oh fuck laugh   and as a lot of uh  well i'll look him over next time  one or two words </unclear   well i don't look at him like that cos i don't  y'know you know he's only my brother i mean   word   you know what i mean  like i really   laugh   billy i see it in because bill  keeps getting like fat  ya one or two words your brother    ya  and his face  he keeps getting like   ya  and like he and valerie like they change so much like every time i see them it's like stress dinner parties   y'know you know  diet  ya they're on   ya   i mean it's like   you know like  ya they're really caught up in a social whirlwind eh the  two of them  ya   no it's just because i've seen them look so different  i mean they haven't always looked one way y'know  you know like bri's brother   he uhm   he always was this kind of build so i just figured well  they they kin they have different genes or something   but i never assumed he was ever the other way  but he used to be just like bri so   oh ya  ya  but i mean to see billy look so different and then look so different  and valerie she just like changes all the time plus  half the time she says she really needs to diet and she looks fine  ya  like   no she's on a major dieting kick again now  weight watchers  that's> not good for you though too much   to diet </[  laugh no i know   no of course  you you end up uh uh  diet too often you don't end up losing weight anymore  it's like this pattern sets up so that to lose weight again becomes very difficult
