 and i have to ask mister speaker what this says about the kind of canada that government envisions  what kind of constitution will it be if corporations have rights such as to pollute the property they own when children have no recognized rights to health care in this country crowd response, 3 seconds   surely mister speaker our goal for canada must not simply be to further the rights of private interests but to further the rights of canadian families and to further the public good applause, 10 seconds  french, 1 minute 10 seconds applause, 5 seconds  a constitution mister speaker is in a word about freedom  the rights to equality to recognize diversity the rights of individuals  as enshrined in the charter of individual rights and freedoms   but i say mister speaker that there is no freedom without public health care  there is no freedom for the worker without a job  there is no freedom for the woman without equality  there is no freedom for the child without education  there is no freedom for the minority without human rights  applause, 15 seconds   a charter of social rights would direct governments to provide  quality health care work toward full employment move society towards equality provide education for our young and ensure that the human rights of all are respected   a charter of social rights mister speaker is about creating greater freedom  surely that is a goal that all members of this house  embrace  mister speaker as we enter this remarkable period in our history  the question confronting canadians is can we agree upon a vision  a vision of this country a destination that we can all share  i believe we can do that mister speaker  canadians are a caring and a tolerant people  we are a people who celebrate the richness of our society and value the bonds we share  we have a history of drawing on each other's strengths and compensating for each other's weaknesses  we have a future if we choose it of a stronger partnership a shared prosperity equality and freedom  i recently read an article about the opening of ah a new school in toronto and during that opening the school choir performed some  compositions  seventy-five children from every racial and every cultural background seventy-five very different children growing up together and learning to live together and singing together and among the songs they sang were dare to dream and look beyond tomorrow  let us think of these children mister speaker as we enter this new phase in the development of canada and of our constitution  let us dare to dream and let us look beyond tomorrow  applause and crowd reaction, 20 seconds tape cuts out   speaker introducing private members' bill before house  monsieur le president uh this is the first time i've had the privilege of winning a draw on private members' business and i was delighted that my uh motion was was  drawn in the uh recent draw and i can now present it to the house  uh i have a number of items on the order paper in the   uh under the uhh private members' business section uh and i'm pleased to at least have one come forward even if it's uh for a brief debate   i had hoped that perhaps at the end of the hour the government might allow the motion to pass uh so that we could uh possibly see some government action on this in this particular area of wh which i know the government is in fact considering   m many canadians mister speaker are unaware of the plight of the ukrainian-canadians who were interned during world war one   in fact uh when the war broke out the government said that  canadian- uh ukrainians who had immigrated to canada from the western ukrainian territories of galicia and buc bukavee  bukovina both of which were then part of the austro-hungarian empire uh were enemy aliens and they posed a threat to national security   mister speaker uh the government took the view that this threat required that these particular persons who were in many cases canadian citizens ought to be interned and held in camps for the duration of the war and accordingly about five thousand ukrainian-canadians were in fact interned by the federal government in twenty-six camps that were located across canada  one of those camps happened to be in my riding of kingston and the islands and was in the famous old fort there fort henry uh which was built sometime in the nineteenth in the middle of the nineteenth century   approximately eighty-eight thousand others mister speaker most of them uh ukrainian-canadians were forced to report regularly to local police and to internal uh security authorities  this uh in spite of the fact that in many cases these persons posed absolutely no risk uh security or otherwise to the canadian state   i'd like to read a quotation from a book written by lubomyr luciuk a constituent of mine mister speaker who's a professor at the   uh at queen's university in the department of geography  uh mister luciuk uh is a well-known ukrainian-canadian  and and member of the uh committee that is seeking redress in this case and he has written a pamphlet called a time for atonement uh subtitled canada's first national internment operations and the ukrainian-canadians nineteen fourteen to nineteen twenty  and i'd like to quote from his book page nineteen  from the mentioned book   again he's quoting  continues from the mentioned book   mister speaker uh the internment  internment uh went on for a considerable period uh until nineteen twenty in fact but uh the internment was not the only problem faced by these citizens  in nineteen seventeen uh many members will recall the government at the time passed the wartimes elections act the wartime elections act which disenfranchised most ukrainian-canadians as well as many others  uhh uh members will recall that the vote was given to women of men serv serving uh uh wives of men serving in the armed forces  it was also uh taken away from persons of german origin  canadians of german origin and other uh groups that were involved in the first world war on the other side  it was not an election act of which canadians can be proud  in fact uh frankly it was a national disgrace  uh the government rigged the elections very much in its favour so that it could win uh the nineteen seventeen election campaign uhm uh which saw the u union government as it then was run and win the election in that year   they paid for it in due course as a historical footnote because of course in nineteen twenty-one uh they were thrown out and replaced with a very sound administration under the very distinguished and capable william lyon mackenzie king   in nineteen eighteen an already censored uh ukrainian language press was closed down  uh and this obviously right near the end of the war  during the war ukrainian-canadians were often maligned in regional and national newspapers  they were forced to work as poorly paid labourers in remote areas and were often relocated away from their homes and their families   those imprisoned had their prof property  confiscated as i've already indicated  some committed suicide while they were imprisoned  and some were killed in unsuccessful escape attempts  when the war ended a large number of the uh of the  ukrainian-canadians were still interned and the government changed their status from that of enemy alien to bolshevik and kept them locked up  for fear that they might be sympathetic with the new communist regime in the soviet union  and not until nineteen twenty were the camps finally closed down  there was never any evidence presented in any public place  that ex that the ukrainian-canadians posed a threat to national security and indeed the government never produced any evidence to that effect at all  indeed in january nineteen fifteen the british foreign office informed the federal government that ukrainian-canadians should be treated as  friendly aliens  the government was told that many ukrainians like other nationalities within the austro-hungarian empire were opposed to austro-hungarian rule and would not therefore be sympathetic with  with canada's enemy in the war  the motion that i have put before the house is one that is supported by the ukrainian canadian committee  that committee wishes the government to formally acknowledge the unjust and unwarranted treatment that these persons received during the first world war  they would like to have the event commemorated by having historical markers established at the various internment sites including at fort henry in kingston which was the first site used as an internment camp  i should also note as an historical footnote that the same fort was used during world war two to house prisoners of war and indeed the international red cross uh made statements concerning its use as a  as a prisoner of war camp that it was not a suitable place to house prisoners so one can only imagine uh what the condition was uh during the first world war when no international organization apparently was involved in checking on the internees  the ukrainian canadian committee has asked the firm of price waterhouse to compile a study on the financial losses of the internees  the report is due later this autumn and once it is complete the committee would like to discuss the matter of redress with the government   the treatment of japanese canadian  canadians who were interned during world war two has clearly established some kind of precedent  however uh it's certainly clear that given the  ma many number of years that have elapsed since this internment took place very few if any of the internees must still be alive and accordingly the committee is not seeking a redress on an individual basis but rather in the establishment of a trust uh fund for the ukrainian community in canada which could be used for various purposes of that community   uh mister uh madame speaker the purpose of the motion that i have put before the house is to urge the government to look at the facts look at the record and see if something cannot be done that would in some way commemorate the evil that was perpetrated by our country on these people at that time  these were innocent citizens of our country who were never convicted of any crime who just happened to come from an area with which canada was at war  because of that they were deemed uh unsuitable to carry on their daily lives on their farms and their homes wherever they happened to live in canada were rounded up and herded into these camps   they were separated from their friends from their families from their communities and held far longer than was necessary solely uh because the government perceived there may be a security risk to our country because of the fact they came from that particular part of europe  with great respect uh it is clearly a situation that calls for some kind of relief  uh i'm not suggesting as i indicated earlier that payments be made to individuals and neither is the ukrainian canadian committee  the committee seeks redress for the community and seeks to have the fact of this internment commemorated in plaques at the various locations across canada where these internments took place  in closing perhaps i could quote uh my uh friend mister luciuk and bohdan kordan both members of the ukrainian canadian community uh when they published an article in the kingston whig-standard newspaper   the uh article i think uhh summarized at least the views of their community and they wrote as follows  quote from previously mentioned newspaper   madame speaker i know that the government is sympathetic to the plight of these people uh or to the plight that they suffered in any  in any event these many years ago  i know that the government is considering moving on this issue  i urge them to take the matter in hand handle it with dispatch  and seek to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory to ensure that the fact that this type of thing went on in our country is not forgotten but is indeed commemorated uh perhaps as a sad reminder of how sometimes we fall off our notions of fairness and equity and justice which we so often take for granted in canada today
