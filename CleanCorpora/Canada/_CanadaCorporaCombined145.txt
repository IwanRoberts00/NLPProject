 it's the quebec culture uh summarized or something like  that   yeah   skating year round  yeah  eh eh are we are well you sell em   them so maybe you do know  i mean do we do more of it here in montreal than we do say in other cities  i mean is it is more of it done here than in say toronto or vancouver  not yet actually  the trends like all trends seem to flow out of california and then on their way go to vancouver first toronto next  and last year toronto had its big boom year according to the industry uh and this year it's montreal  so we're a year behind  but the thing that's different about quebec is the enthusiasm with which it's been taken up  there's a it went from being something like sixteen officially recognized amateur hockey leagues uh or teams  last year to something like two hundred in the province registered  with the association  yeah some enormous amount  i don't know the exact number but it's in the hundreds  uhm hmm   your kidding   yeah  and uh twenty thousand kids participating this year in the leagues  it's really uh it's grown explosively  now now is growth  is there a downside to growth like that with people don't know what they're doing yet  yeah i think so  i think the enthusiasm with the sport uhm just leads to the fact that there's going to be thirty percent new skaters   when you see people skating this year thirty percent of them will never have been on blades before  yeah hmm  they'll be familiar with it from having gone skating uhm on ice  and people tend to learn it very quickly here  be very enthusiastic > words   okay so it's the same physical movement really yeah   same physical movement  the skating going forward is no problem  it's the braking that makes the huge difference  people uh tend not to wear pads because you don't wear pads when you just go skating on ice   yeah   and they don't learn how to brake necessarily or realize how important it is that you must learn how to brake one of the first things  yeah now has has yvan cournoyer's rollerblading team uh uh the roadrunners roller hockey international team  uh have they have they caused this excitement or is it the other way around  i mean are they are they just latching on to a trend do you think  uh part uh i think it's a little bit of both  yeah yeah   they definitely building up the hype about it  and the promotion and advertising that they put together  the very fact that it's yvan cournoyer probably draws a lot of attention to the sport  legitimizes it a lot for kids to want to participate in the summer  uh but other than that and i think it's kind of reciprocal  okay now let's find out if even if  your not involved with with rollerblading uh eh playing hockey  if you want to go out there and get some exercise  city of montreal uh has a new policy  people are not permitted to rollerblade where they are and where they aren't  and uh why don't we save them a few bucks in tickets and find out where they are not allowed to rollerblade  they are on bicycle pa they are allowed on bicycle paths now right  that's correct  i think as of last friday that seems to be the case that  they're allowed to you're allowed to uh do your in-line skating on bicycle paths  any bicycle paths  and you you have as much right as any cyclist there  i think so   from what i understand that's the case  okay and where shouldn't you go  now   uh they don't want you to go downtown more than anything  on busy streets they don't want you to go  they don't want you to go anywhere without proper protection  uhm hmm  uhm you can roll in the parks obviously if you don't but on the street they're definitely  the police if they're going to stop anyone it's someone who's being reckless who's not following uh the regular uh you know street safety rules of just you know giving the right of way to pedestrians   okay   cos technically your not out on the streets at all are ya  technically you're not allowed to according to i think it's quebec law  it would have to be changed and not municipal law that says that rollerblades uh or uh skate uh skateboards roller skates or in-line skates effectively are not allowed on the streets  but uh municipal police know that they can't really do very much in terms of people going on the streets at large  they're going to focus on people who are causing problems more  okay because it sounds to me as if you've got a   a lot of accidents in the making what with the  i mean the the popularity of bicycles in  montreal's montreal has exploded in the last fifteen or twenty year years and we know the complaints uh that we get uh about about cyclists  now you've got the rollerbladers you got the pedestrians you've got obviously the motorists and you've got uh and you've got rolle bladers  it sounds as if it's getting awfully crowded out there  yeah goodness knows what else could fit on the streets  laugh   but what it does   we could move at all   yeah but a couple of things come to mind though  we need more  i think more public access to really good routes in the city would be a nice thing  i mean it's a healthy thing  there's no reason the city shouldn't encourage it in its citizens or that the province shouldn't encourage this kind of athletic participation  people want to use their legs and feet to transport themselves to and from work  we can give them the way to do it safely  we should be promoting that kind of thing rather than inhibiting or prohibiting it because we don't understand or we're afraid of it or we don't have the means  presently to deal with it  hmm   yeah   yeah   now goodness knows we don't need to build up another bureaucratic level but do you think people should get a little training before especially going out on the streets  yah but see actually   you see a lot of people weaving in and out of there who should know better  uh yeah i think that's true but uh it should be mostly coming from the shops  uh people have friends  everyone knows somebody who's roll who's rollerblading   yeah  there're places where you can get lessons if you're not familiar  you should never start off on the streets but go to a place that's flat  a school yard or down to the old port on a slow day not on a saturday or sunday when it's overloaded with people  they you can even ask almost any rollerblader for a little advice and they'd give it to you  uhm hmm   yeah  freely  now uhm at first blush i mean uh the the  the bicycle path sounds like your they sound like your best bet because they can get you uh all over uh town  can you  yeah as far as transportation goes they're your best bet  for recreation and fun though there's a lot of other places to go  okay why why would uh the  the path not necessarily be a recreational choice  of course you can't do much other than go in two directions  that's it uhm for instance this weekend i went uh uh from the mountain jeanne mance park down to the olympic stadium and it was mostly for transportation because the bike path isn't that beautiful in most of its parts along that route  but uh the other thing is that you it's  narrow  so they're not really designed for people on blades  your legs go out side to side  bikes oncoming bike traffic or behind you  you gotta have got to be careful on a  bike path word   you do have to be careful  i yeah now now cyclists uh have uh whether uh it's fair or not have a pretty rough refu reputation in this city  what's what's the etiquette and  what what should you be watching for when you're on the bike paths and you got cyclists coming both ways  you gotta have got to look behind you once in a while  in front of you when you see a bike coming on you just  gotta have got to glide past them without actually uhm skating so that you don't draw your feet out in front of them  it's kind it's commonsensical   then otherwise just make sure you give the right of way to the people ahead of you  it's the same kind of rules as driving or any sport  just if someone can't see you because they're ahead of you they've got the right of way  pedestrians have the right of way and cyclists have to treat the bladers in the same with the same respect i suppose  yeah have have they  i mean are they going to be welcoming out there laugh   building territory   so far i haven't seen a problem   most of the time i get a big smile you know  when people see me blading there not a a   look of curiosity but no animosity no bad words  i haven't heard a single story to that effect really  yeah   okay you mentioned there are better places than the bicycle paths for recreation  where would you go for for fun  sheer fun  uh the old port is great on the weekends   it's just such a jumble of people  there's so many people down there blading  uh the lachine canal's a beautiful path  parc lafontaine is turning into a real hot spot as well  lots of people there and it's a beautiful park though it desperately needs to be repaved if anyone from the city is listening right now laugh   and uh then most of the other municipal parks are really good  any of the paved municipal parks i'd say are the finest places to go  other than that small streets uhm in the suburbs  if you're gonna going to   if you're gonna going to go against  the the provincial law as it stand to go to the quiet streets in the plateau are wonderful  it's a great you see some beautiful architecture  you can explore different neighbourhoods rather quickly  uh old montreal with its cobblestone streets is a place to avoid  yeah yeah   pick a quiet street laugh   yeah   uhm hmm uhm hmm  and the other thing to watch out for is a big warning to anyone who has just gotten blades who does want to maybe venture onto the street is they repair the streets with this gooey tar that fills the cracks in the city and if you're not aware of what you're doing or where you're going and your blades go into one of those you fall over you could really hurt yourself  okay and safety as far as what you should wear  you should have a helmet  helmet definitely  and a bicycle helmet i hear is not good enough  uh no it's not ideal because when you when  beginners or people who are going to fall tend to fall they fall on the backs on their backsides  and the head the back of your head the back of the crown of your head is what's at risk so inline helmets are  should be more like skateboard helmets i e they should cover the back of your head  or if they look like bike helmets they should come down further towards the back of your head  uh kids or anyone should also wear wrist guards  that is the single greatest cause of injuries people not wearing wrist guards  so you're talking more yeah   what if you fall forward uh you uh tend to uh push your hands out and uh hurt your hands   yeah well you're going a little bit   you're going as fast as you are when you're running and suddenly you fall  you catch some of that gooey stuff on the street  down you go and your wrists are the first place to break  uh other than that the uh knee pads are a good thing and especially if you're playing some hockey or something like that  and then elbow pads are a good idea as well  they usually come with most of the protection equipment but   be seem to be less important than the other parts
