 someone else is working with top of the l   top of the line high speed zeiss lenses with a very good  sixteen or super sixteen camera and you can just say okay well i'll get second unit images and mount their lenses to your camera and run off  and the way it's been designed is to be held like this right  so it's very good for handheld stuff you know  asks a question   you can reserve it for your class projects  comments   kay okay   i've spoken to bob i told him i was showing you this camera and two students ran outta out of here from this morning and booked it for two days each because they liked the flexibility of this camera better than this  this is a good camera without a doubt  it's just that there have been so many modifications to the sixteen mil millimetre synch camera over the last  forty years that i mean there's no point in using this outside of the university  in the university if you're using black and white film or colour films great camera  the lenses are sharp there's no problem it's just you gotta  have got to fight to keep it quiet  asks a question   it's hard to say like i mean there are preferences right  i mean what i've worked with more is arri cameras  so i like arri cameras better  i like the loading system and the mechanisms  but though if the eclair is better for handheld than this camera without a doubt  th this camera is heavy and it's awkward compared to the eclair  asks a question   this one yeah  cos this one can hold a four hundred foot mag  magazine and it can also run on daylight spools  so i mean it's completely flexible  asks a question   on this  this this does have a barney  kay okay which is a jacket for it  comments   the barney does nothing laughter from audience   asks a question   nothing  what really works well for this camera is a down blanket and a leather jacket and two sound blankets over the camera operator and the word   comments   and then you use these clips to to to   keep everything together  then underneath the camera once you've got the camera covered what happens is the sound goes down  and in montreal we have concrete floors and we have hardwood floors  and if you know anything about sound it's very good for  reverb reverberations   which means that the boom operators point the boom down as they're taught in this university to record the sound   they're not only gonna going to get the voice of the actor but they're gonna going to  get the sound of the camera bouncing off the floor and echoing back into the mic  asks a question   what you do is in the crotch of the tripod right underneath the uh screw where you level it put another sound bracket   kay okay   so really what you need is depending on how of an enclosed space right  if you're outside and you're on a telephoto lens you don't need anything  comments   but if you're at this distance and there you're the soundman at a distance of three and a half feet pronounced 'freet'  from my gate he's gonna going to have a heart attack trying to get any kinda kind of sound  and then you're gonna going to be throwing a lot of sound blankets on it  but you've gotta got to remember to put one underneath to prevent the sound from bouncing down kay  okay   and like that it's fine  like that it works well  when i shot with this there was no camera noise but we spent a lot of time in the first four hours of the shoot trying to figure out how to stop the sound loud door opening and closing kay   okay   kay okay now i'll show you the insides of these cameras  the loop on this camera is far easier loud scraping noise  to load than the arri s  but the magazine is the opposite  so i mean they're both similar   kay okay   to open the camera right here by the door the   is where the eyepiece is  this silver knob is turned like that and the door opens   and that's how you lock it kay okay   so you've opened it   this is the inside of the camera like that kay   okay   kay okay   here is your pressure plate and your door   and the pin registration pin sits right there on this little hook  to turn that there's a knob loud noise, something sliding across the floor   to turn it there is this knob kay okay   you push that down and turn and if you watch not only does it move the film through the gate frame by frame but it adjusts the registration pin  in order to load the camera you need to have that pin up   which is just you know you'd see that whether or not i told you  there's no way to get the film in the gate  yeah and the inside of the mag magazine   looks like so kay okay   now to load the mag magazine it's  gotta got to be off the camera  to take it off  this is the only problem i have with this camera is this one design problem  the handle is in the way of the mag  i s suggest that if you are working on a tripod and you're inside and you're not doing handheld  take it off  to take this off you pull forward  it pulls this up unlocks the handle and slides out  that way you have a greater access into the mag  magazine which is just turn this knob and it pulls  a metal sheet out that locks it the mag magazine  and there you go  so the word mag magazine   is   the easiest way to describe it for people to remember and it's the same as that mag magazine for the arri s is you do a nine in and then a mirror image of a nine out  that's what the film looks like  and what you'll see what i mean but that's how you remember it   so it goes in through a hole right here loud noise starts underneath are loud noise ends the white  sprockets   you turn this it tur pulls  the film through  keep it going  right here which there's another little notch that notch tells you   asks a question   it's a stop for the loop kay okay   that's your loop the length of the loop  you then return the film into the mirror hole on the other side and you move the other wheel word   and you have to be precise  otherwise you'll get more noise and the film could break as well   and you might be saying why am i doing it upside down  well in a black bag you're not gonna going to   see what you're doing anyhow   and this is what i mean by a mirror image of the nine   and never forget to put these arms down because that's your footage counter  and clears throat your camera operator and director of photography will send you back into the black bag to put them down cos that's the only way to tell what the footage is  loud scraping along floor starts three words  camera footage loud scraping along floor ends counter on the camera the footage counter here runs the one on the camera  kay okay   the next thing you do is load it in like so kay  okay   you put the back in first push this down and tighten the screw   and don't hold it like that   the next step is to push this in   really there's nothing to show  there's a loop inside the camera   kay okay my loop's too big   asks a question   because it must have slipped when i was trying to get it in and pushed out more film  so that means i have to go back into the black bag   asks a question   when it's touching the ground   no problem background noises and audience talking for about 20 seconds   so this got jammed so i'm gonna going to   use a different mount  asks a question   uhh i think you get three mags magazines    asks a question   each mag can take four hundred  asks a question   it's twelve and a half to thirteen minutes because they always put a little bit of work room on it background noises and audience talking for about 25 seconds   asks a question   what  asks a question   yeah was it the arri three   cos the arri three is one of the last that are being used  asks a question   no last cameras that have magazines  in this model pause about ten seconds   comments   comments   comments   you just have to get used to it pause about ten seconds  asks a question   yeah it's just that if you're not working in a tent which is  i don't know if you've seen those bags  comments   yeah it's just that if you have a university black bag  you have a greater chance of ripping the bag  comments   and then pause about ten seconds   asks a question   nah it depends on the film stock  comments pause about 15 seconds   asks a question   don't have the gate for it  it's a different gate  kay okay   really long and drawn out rrreally frustrated  background noises and audience talking for about 55 seconds   kay okay that's what it looks like   with the with the door shut kay  okay   those mags magazines are jammed uhm but i'll take a look at them and bob and me'll make sure that they're fixed for the time that you gotta got to  start shooting kay okay   asks a question   this is a single mag magazine   asks a question   the arri s  comments   it has a similar mag magazine to the b l  comments   no because the difference is that the b l mag   magazine kay okay has this motor attached to the word   kay okay this is the motor that runs the film through it  the difference between the arri s which again makes it a more flexible camera is that i need three mags magazines   i go get three mags magazines   i only need one motor loud scraping noise because my motor comes off  and so  asks a question   the arri s  the thing is it's actually easier to load because it's a flat surface kay okay   so that's what makes these mags magazines   completely uninterchangeable with the b l   so you can't take three mags magazines  and say well one'll go on the arri the s and one'll go on the b l  kay okay   so with the film in this is what the camera should sound like   and one thing you have to do is get to know what a proper sounding camera is and what a camera that's not running well sounds like   so to start your camera on the pistol grip here is your on and off button kay okay camera starts running  that is what a proper sounding camera is supposed to sound like pause about ten seconds   comments camera stops running   what do you mean it's not running camera starts running  comments camera stops running   it's running at twenty-four frames per second laughter from audience   but it's not picking up properly laughter from audience   comments   yeah  i'm just slightly distracted cos the production i'm working on just called me with a nine one one message so  asks a question   well let me just fix this to show you that the camera is not a complete disaster laughter from audience pause about 10 seconds   camera starts running there  cameras do jam kay okay that's  every camera in the world camera stops running   asks a question   why  asks a question   a power surge  asks a question   yeah the sound  the sound of the camera  but i wasn't listening to it cos i was being paged  but uhm the sound of the camera cos it doesn't have a fluid motion anymore  you hear it in the magazine something happened  for example this is  kay okay i'm gonna show you an example of a jam would be to have the film go in without a pick-up right  you heard what it sounded like clean but this is what it sounds like camera starts running   it just it becomes louder there's a scraping sound and as the film gets full camera stops running   but don't forget your ear's next to the camera at all times  right   that's a jam sound kay okay   that  asks a question   yeah   alright where you can hear that sound   inside the loop looks fine but you have that   comments   but at the same time if you catch it soon enough the film isn't like this like an accordion right  comments   so it's all fine   if you think there's a jam you go into the black bag you open it  comments   it's on this side alright  i cut it so it's not on this side but it's on this side  so all you have to do is wind it cut the film off  re-can it   okay so i'll show you a couple of ways around that without having to use the extra source  cos like i'm saying the extra source isn't ideal especially if you're concerned about sound   uhm we'll get to that in a moment   now clears throat interference on tape begins   word one in this case are one or two words  bars interference on tape ends the synch signal  uhh two and three are what we're concerned about  four there is nothing  d v one d v two refer to digital video  that's a frame grab and i'll show you how to do that kay  okay it's just still in one video in uh one frame  through the video  d v three are colour backgrounds
