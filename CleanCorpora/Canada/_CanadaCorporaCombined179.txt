 uhm  and and if you look at it and say well you know i think well then we just add in this sentence here or these two sentences here and it's basically  it's it's it's not that much of a change  then then we could we could   bring up the point that night  hmm   if it's not the point then uh then uh   uhm you know an extended  ah what i'll do too is i'm going to call the woman who was the president of our board of directors of our daycare  was w stepping down as president at the time uh that our relocation came came through  mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm  and so we asked her to stay on as the chairperson of our relocation committee  mm hmm  because she was the person who actually   she was the the the founding f  mother of the daycare  mm hmm  and so she knew a lot of the ins and outs of what regulations were required uh building codes for example   for daycare  mm hmm   i didn't realize that certain windows have to be a certain size and and that you can't have a daycare in a room where there are no windows and you can't have it in the basement unless windows are so large and  uhm uh bathroom facilities have to be within so many feet  and that kind of thing   mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm   and she was aware of all of those things so we asked her to stay on because it was she just had the knowledge that none of us had and would take us far too long and probably we would've made quite a few mistakes along the way had we not asked her to stay on   sure yeah   mm hmm mm hmm   uhm and what i think i'll do is i'll probably give her a call and uhm perhaps she might remember th  more about the relocation than than   i did rather than do our own things and uh   so what i remember about it and how we handled certain situations  uhm might be uhm embellished by the conversation with her  mm hmm   excellent excellent   mm hmm   or in fact it there could be that there was a meeting held and i wasn't able to go or something and so we may have i i might be missing a very key point  mm hmm  so i'll speak with her to to uhm to  refresh my memory because what i would like to do  is is perhaps provide a little bit of background information for the committee  excellent   cos the committee getting it cold might think well gee  why do we have to advise the community that we're moving in uhm and uh i think if they were a little sensitive to the fact that here were only thirty little babies wanting to move into a building and a whole community became very upset  mm hmm  uh certainly uhm m your child being displaced for another school would upset a community  to a to a great degree and so we have to really think about that  oh yeah   sure   excellent point  so all of those things to to  sensitize them to the issue at the time that we present the change   so they understand the need for the addition to uh  to the letter  mm hmm   that would also help the the tenor of the letter that i was talking about because it gives a very strong message to the board that we are we are trying to take this   we are trying to look at the larger picture as well  mm hmm mm hmm   that sends the right message   it's not just our school but the community that we serve and the community that we are relocated to  mm hmm   okay  alright   i can't believe i asked myself for more work  well no but this is this is  exactly the type of work that that you would you would excel at and really uhm   well i found every time that a document has gone out this year sending it out uhm to people like yourself has made it a better document  every single time  but in some cases th they  it's good to have a lot of opinion on   on uhm especially something that's going to the board uhm because i think you can't you you really if you're representing the community then it has to be a community effort  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  uh i guess that's why i i  really wanted people to comment on the sexual harassment policy  because i wanted it to be a community thing  i know yeah   i didn't want it to be a one thing  and and yet uhm i suppose  it's a difficult issue for a lot of people to deal with uhm  and and they may not have had the opportunity to encounter those kinds of issues in their day to day work life in terms of policy setting issues   mm hmm   and so uhm uh i uh it i'm  glad that i was able to help uhm   it's only unfortunate that other people uhm  couldn't have shared in the experience or maybe they could have used that to take to their workplace and insist that they had a policy  in place in their workplace  it would've been and i think the lack of response to my gut feeling was the lack of response was   that they felt very comfortable with what  what was said and if if they read it and i think that i think that   most if not everybody read it read it  thoroughly  mm hmm   but i think that there was almost a feeling that it was fairly there was something almost intimidating about it   do you know what i mean about the whole idea of it and the whole uhm process  that it might have been intimidating for people to  to read it and comment on it   they look down on it   yes it uh it it's something   it's it's something that they might have felt was a little over their head  hmm   right  it to tell you the truth uhm   that was that was uhm part of my  feeling  i read it and   two or three words too   laugh   yes well it was but but   you well first of all you you   took it on and then you also used not just your expertise but other people's expertise  mm hmm  and so that was that gave you uh uh confidence  mm hmm  whereas you know a a mother or a father at the school reading this it's a pretty heavy thing and  and to make it to formally go up to someone who's written something and and  make a comment you wanna want to feel   comfortable with the subject matter   yes yes laugh   it ain't word or two laugh    the subject matter isn't exact  isn't a comfortable topic either  so i i would take it as i would take it as  just a vote of confidence  mm hmm   i really uhm i really  thought that that was exactly what it was  mm hmm mm hmm  it's just as as i said uhm when you're representing a community you want to feel as if something has been a community effort  mm hmm  and there's a sense of the well being when something's for  the community after all   mm hmm   you you feel that you've accomplished something when it's been done for the community as a whole  uhm and and with the community  yeah   so uhm i i i i guess for that reason that's why i sort of felt that there was a certain degree of emptiness in my in my handing over the document to the uh to the board but uhm  well another another   time another another topic and i think we'll get  word or two   i pick difficult topics you know  laugh   yeah well   this is this isn't a difficult   one   this isn't a difficult one because   this goes to it's a pretty primary it   it deals with with relocation   yeah   mm hmm   that's laugh that's  gonna going to hit all our children  and there are some very e very everyday   aspects to it that hit everybody's lives  word   i know i can pick apart the the   the real feeling word   i find that very often you can   you can not attack but you can get away with a lot more uhm when you're dealing with people about their issues but when you're dealing with them about their children's issues they get really  assertive laugh   mm hmm mm hmm that's right   it it becomes a different kettle of fish very quickly  i noticed at the meeting uh the volunteers' luncheon  that uhm that was held when uh there was discussion about the relocation of the school  and an invitation to uh the parents that were there to come  and participate in uh the next uh uh school committee meeting  mm hmm   mm hmm   hmm   i noticed keen interest from people that i had never seen before  oh   excellent   they wanted to know the date and the time and  where it was gonna going to be held   excellent excellent   so i i would imagine that you're going to have uhm a somewhat of a larger turn-out than you what you would normally have  at least i would hope  mm hmm  uhm is there   oh excuse me it's also in the uhm  it's also gone out with a little blurb in with our  school committee  in fact it was the first point of the school  committee highlights to say you may have read about the uhm  leedsman school board uhm uh resolution or whatever it was  to to change uh to to change the language of instruction uhm of some schools in the leedsman school board enclosure  okay   and we uhm i can't remember how i put this or something but we may be affect uhm if affected   if affected uhm we would like to be heavily involved  your school committee is already in getting uhm setting up a meeting on this issue and uhm we want to be sure uh if we are affected that we are part of the process and that we uhm are aware of the new facility we are moving into and there will be a meeting of the school committee on the twelfth of june  all e p p parents are invited to come  and the reason for that was school-wide we wanted to plant that end of sentence tape ends   the purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the uh   hammerstein judgement  i would like nothing better than to discuss this judgement with you adelaide   oh right weren't you a member of the winning party  yes in fact i was the junior attorney on the forum  that must be quite exciting and i hear this was an action for approximately seven million dollars in damages in a medical liability suit  yes it was   that's right it was and it was a very uh long and uh contentious process to bring to trial  and as you know we encountered some difficulty in uh dealing with all the various issues that arose in this trial including uh having to uh secure the uh presence of certain witnesses  at any rate   well   i guess the first order of business is to review the facts as set out in uh luke gerard's judgement in pages  six to fifty approximately  so it's very factored in the judgement which we're very pleased with because it leaves very little room for appeal since only legal issues can be appealed  although i think uh i don't know if   you've you've uh sort of digested i don't even think i have but i am wondering whether or not on the fault issue itself there may be an opening for an appeal  hmm   uh although he makes a determination with respect to the facts surrounding the fault issue uhm   i think perhaps creative treatment of how he deals with it might lead to an appeal  well i think it's his only option for an appeal is to dig up that question of fault and uh examine it dissect it  extraodinarily thoroughly in the hopes that his appeal can succeed on that point because as for the determination of the facts themselves i don't think that there really is much room left for any other interpretation beyond that which judge gerard gave it  yeah   yeah  it's interesting eh because we were so worried during the trial about whether or not all the points we were trying to make would actually translate into the judgement  and to a large part uhm he s the judge seems to have really listened to and review it in detail the transcripts that we submitted on all the fact issues uhm  although uh there are some things which are still unclear but one of the points that he does make is that we are attempting to  determine in terms of the uh the timing issues  uh a very short period of time with approximate estimates of  what happened  yeah   uhm
