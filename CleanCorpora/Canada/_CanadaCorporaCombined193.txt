 he's third   and so the final standings after the men's original program viktor petrenko of the soviet union leads kurt browning petr barna is third  and what a day for the canadians elvis stojko's seventh michael slipchuk is eighth tv advertisements   petr barna brings the men's original program to a spectacular close  the event had everything we expected and maybe a little bit more  well the top four finishers this afternoon really made this a very exciting event and as we all expected the top two finishers  viktor petrenko and kurt browning  now the judges seemed to prefer petrenko's style over browning's  however that is irrelevant because going into the long program any one of the top three men can win  and we all must remember that this is the exact same position kurt is sitting in that he was in last year when he defended his world title  paul kurt browning happy with where he stands  so are the other two canadians  chris the top four were not the only ones to enjoy outstanding performances s today  our canadians michael slipchuk and elvis stojko also gave  outstanding performances although they had some minor problems in their original programs they are sitting in an excellent position going into tomorrow night's long program which has all the makings of being a classic  it certainly does  we look forward to that  and when we return we'll have the pairs free skate this evening  as eisler and brasseur skate for gold  that's when we come back to the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships from the olympiahalle here in munich tv advertisements   and we welcome you back to the olympiahalle in munich germany  c b c's continuing prime time coverage of the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships  and just a reminder still to come this evening isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler go for gold in the pairs competition  they are the leaders heading into tonight's pairs free program  and again that is yet to come in tonight's telecast  judging is a very important and i don't have to tell you people extremely controversial part of this sport  to explain more about judging and just how it works in figure skating here is one of canada's international judges jean senft  segment on judging techniques   well i certainly don't envy the task of the judges having to decide between kurt browning and viktor petrenko  there's such a fine line between the two  but now let's turn our attention to the pairs competition  because it could be an historic night for lloyd eisler and isabelle brasseur  well we're all hoping it'll be a great night for lloyd and isabelle and they are more confident than ever going into this long program this evening and i also think that they have the strongest  program here tonight and and if they hit it i think there's no problem they can win it  chris i thought the strength of the pairs event was evident last night when christine hough and doug ladret made one mistake  but as a result find themselves in tenth place going into this long  the biggest surprise of the evening was perhaps stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier who put in an excellent outing and as a result find themselves in eighth place going into tonight's long program  brasseur and eisler will skate last tonight  right now we join hough and ladret next thirty seconds untranscribed: audio cuts out   the next element the side-by-side triple toe loops   they both have a little bit of trouble on it but nevertheless it s doesn't upset the flow of the program too badly at all   christine had a problem with the landing of the throw double axle  i'm surprised  she usually does that element perfectly   chris there's a situation where you're attempting a very difficult element at almost the four minute mark of a program  and i have to wonder if they couldn't have placed that element a little bit earlier when they went in a little bit fresher and had a better chance of executing it   barb in watching christine did you get the feeling that she really wasn't on top of those throws   i really did paul but i also think that this was very difficult for them tonight coming off such a a a  disappointing short program last night  it almost reminds us of it it  it almost reminds me of us in sarajevo   well the canadian fans throwing flowers on the ice for christine hough and doug ladret who are sixth in halifax they're tenth here and certainly will not be able to achieve the same success as last year at the world championships  but she certainly lives up to her nickname tuffy   as barb mentioned when you come into an event such as this   having as they have placed sixth last year you've got a goal of at least attaining that if not something better and it really does tend to take the wind out of your sails when you don't have a short program that goes as well as you'd like  here's a look at the throw triple salchow   christine just looked very far forward on the landing and couldn't hold it   i did wanna want to mention that  last night you mentioned the comedic short program  it went over very big with the british who were raving about it and i was interested that the british judge marked them so much higher than the rest  obviously it struck a chord with the british sense of humour and tonight they showed their versatility in another way  well i thought this was a very nice program  it suited doug and christine a lot  i just think that once they get the elements and the program together they're gonna going to have a great package  they were the national champions in eighty-eight second in canada in nineteen ninety and ninety-one   and the first set of marks   low fives four nine from the german judge four eight from the judge from japan   and now the marks for artistic impression   all fives five ones and five twos  the japanese judge a four point nine   so christine hough and doug ladret are currently in second place trying to stay in the top ten   the young canadians stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier are next when we return to the ninety-one world's in munich after this tv advertisements   here are our surprising canadians  eighth place stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier   just talked to jean-michel a few minutes ago and he says he's nervous  when they came they had nothing to lose but all of a sudden they're in the top ten and maybe could move up  well they have a very dynamic opening planned   they're gonna going to open with a triple twist following it with a throw double axle into side-by-side double axles   well barb they hit two of those three big elements  he seemed to have a little bit of trouble with the double axle of his own but the first two elements were most impressive   the next move they're preparing for is the throw triple salchow and they chose to do a double   because of the fact that this team is very close in height they are able to com create some natural leg lines but i would like to see them actually go home and work a little bit on their unison  they seem to lose it at times and they need to be more aware  of where each other is at all times   as i watch them skate i can't help but notice that they do have something going for them which is very important and that's stacey's  attitude  she's out there smiling having a great time and it comes through and makes you feel comfortable with the team and it shows confidence  well i think they were they were   surprised to even be here at the world championships  i think they put on a great performance for their first world's  it really is fun to watch a couple of young skaters emerge here and they really did seem relaxed on the ice despite what jean-michel told us before-hand  and even with the one mistake one thing you have to remember that one element a program does not make  i've seen a lot of people win titles and have a mistake and i think that's something we all skaters should remember  cos look at their triple twist   a little tight on the landing but it was landed very clean  stacey seventeen years of age  jean-michel's twenty   what we're seeing here is the missed element but i  i have to admit barb that trying to do what they're attempting here is indeed very very difficult  it is very difficult  stacey had no problem with her double axle   i think jean-michel was just a little bit out  out of position going into his  there's their coach jos&eacute;e picard and she seemed delighted  stacey's still got that smile on her face   of course jos&eacute;e also coaches brasseur and eisler  here come the marks for ball and bombardier  the first set of marks five twos and five threes  canadian fans would've like to've to have   seen a little higher  i think the reason why we're seeing these marks is because  some of their pair moves just do not have the difficulty that those above them have  and that's something that's only gonna going to  come with experience  as well i think they need a chance to develop more as a team instead of two individual skaters and i think that will come with time  marks for artistic impression five ones up to five fours   and so stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier right now in third place   later eisler and brasseur skate for gold as c b c's coverage of the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships continues tv advertisements   in contention for a medal here from the united states the american champions  fourteen-year-old natasha kuchiki and todd sand a twenty-seven-year-old  they're both from california  i think they're probably very surprised to be sitting in fourth place right now but there's no pressure on  on them here  they can just go for broke   they'll be opening with side-by-side double axles   that was interesting barb in that he had landed the jump and then appeared to have the difficulty   triple twist had a little little   bit of a hard time getting around but it was landed   that was a nice throw triple loop  she did touch down on the ice but it was a landed throw   todd and natasha had a a disastrous showing at the u s nationals and i think they remember that and so they're just going out here and they're they're   giving it all they've got   although this team has not been together very long they are developing a nice rapport between themselves and that probably has a lot to do with their coach john nicks who did coach nineteen seventy-nine world champions tai babilonia and randy gardner   nice throw triple salchow and very late in the program  i really notice that there tends to to   be a lot of distance between the two skaters on their individual jumps but i think that's something that they're gonna   going to grow with and something that they're  gonna going to they're gonna  going to learn over time   i was impressed by the strength with which they finished this program   todd has had a history of back problems which i know has interrupted their training schedules at various points and a skate this strongly i think is a sign of two really determined individuals   before the competition and you can see the americans are delighted with the performance of this pair he said he felt that in the near future they might be ready to contend for medals but i don't think he anticipated they'd be this close this soon   no i think it was a present not 'pleasant' surprise that they placed as high as they did after the short  as you can see he is extremely pleased with the performance and they have every right to be   very few mistakes and a nice strong finish   i was especially impressed with where they put in that throw triple salchow   just look at the double axles  you can see they are quite far apart
