the last minute  oh ya   just decided that either time money everything it was just not the right time for me  not good   ya  huge disappointment  well these things happen though  no absolutely  ya  and then so then the next year we said no let's do it  and we really wanted to go to like san fransisco and stuff  mhh  but then on the other hand we thought well you know but  we could just go lie at

mhh mhh  and uh and uh what's her name's apartment is like you know one of these sort of atrium ones where it's more like a motel laugh than an apartment building  laugh   ya ya i know what you mean ya  i stayed in a place in brentwood and it was  a a motel basically   it is   it's a motel with a pool in the middle the big  palm trees   ya   the units the units   are sort of all there and they're all the same  ya  ya  ya  interesting huh  oh ya it was great  ya  it was great  and uh and then amy and i would spend most of the day at mission beach  you know there's all these different beaches that  all have different  reputations   mhh   mhhm   mission beach is sort of the hippie one   mhhm   in the guide book it says well mission beach has got you know sort of the reputation for being blah blah blah this and that  and we'll go there laugh   we'll take it   and all it is mostly is you know surfers you know teenage surfer boys  what a hoot  which we totally related to because we just wore swimming trunks and uh e e e  exercise tops  word   that's we just hung out at the beach with our laugh baseball hats backwards laugh   it's like and all these girls got their  their bikinis on and suckin sucking it in  laugh   we're just like and   oh ya the body thing  oh the body thing ha ehm i hate it   i just hate it  of course when i saw the pictures laugh because  if you're not wearing a bikini you're not suckin  sucking it in  laugh   let's put it that way laugh   ya that's right  that's true   i was done  you're up for the theatre if you've got a bikini on  let me tell you  ya   for sure ya  ya  it was really funny laugh   so that was uh it was great   it was really great  ya   i i can't remember a more relaxing really relaxing time  getting on the plane coming home i felt really like yes this is good i'm ready for whatever the next thing is  mhhm   and i didn't have that kind of hysteria  ya   we stayed long enough  like sometimes it's too short and i have this hysteria just before i'm coming home  it's like no i don't want to come home   i'm not ready   i'm not ready  i was ready  it was like okay that's fine  laugh   ya  it was good  it was very good   hmm   ya   so then what was that topic laugh   well we just started we just got on   to the behaviour thing   the sun   the sun right  gee my memory  i don't have a memory actually  i don't have one   laugh   don't even ya  no   you know what my short-term memory is like  laugh   zero  oh ya no no   it seems i mean i just it's amazing what i forget   you're living in the moment the here-and-now   ya this exact moment not the one that had  just went by ten seconds ago   that's right that's right   and tomorrow when somebody says what did you do yesterday  i haven't a clue   laugh exactly  that's what i say  exactly  i don't know  no no i know  when people monday morning i'd come here you know and uh eh everybody who works like all week that's what they always ask you  what did you do on the weekend  no clue  you know what that's so good  that's really great   laugh   like none  oh thank god you're as bad as i am  because i i just don't remember that stuff and and and it's embarassing sometimes cos you think this person must think i'm really out of it  mhh senile  like you're trying to answer but it's like you don't really remember and so you you're  speaking slowly  mhhm   well i li i   maybe it'll come back  no no   i think it doesn't  no i know  no i was like laugh i hear what you mean  no  i'm reading ehm microserfs right now  oh right ya  it's really funny   it's really funny because it's it's  all about that whole thing about being either bodies or  machines  and you know that whole question   mhhm mhhm   and the whole idea about memory as well  mhhm  and sort of what the difference between what memory is  for us and what memory is if you're a computer and  you know where these are similar and where they are different  obviously   mhhm   mhhm   and it's pretty interesting  hmm  it's pretty interesting
