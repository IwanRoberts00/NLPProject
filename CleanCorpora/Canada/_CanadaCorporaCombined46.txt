 waiting in making it schools first until when  until the the tenth of september  no go making your rounds  making making a first rou  round   m m making  just making a round of all the schools  first round word   mhh hmm  and then seeing if you get you know  you may get something right away  uhm if you don't then i would go to the language schools  well in between that some at some point   i mean i'm gonna going to make phone calls and see if anything comes up you know with  idioma   with idioma ya   there's also with the the the school not the school but the uhm huh the  saint laurent board of trade there  uh uh chambre du commerce that  i mean when things start happening like you know these breakfasts uh these breakfast things i mean if i'm not able to go to them cos i'm in class you  you know you should probably go  ya i could always go   it's just a matter of sitting down and having breakfast or sitting in a group of  you just pass your card around you know   laugh ya  ya right sounds really easy  but  but you know i would try the i would try out  those two possibilities first and see what if anything happens there  and then go to uhm you know private private  language schools and uhm and and and sort of and say that you're available sort of you know either in the late afternoon or at night or in the evenings  or sort of book yourselves give yourselves  give yourself some complete free days  well i don't see the point of that  either i do full time as much as i can get with the private school or i do full time or some kind of contract at least with the school system  and and you know i don't see the point of of splitting up   and i know i know  it's always it's always the same problem    i don't see any point in splitting up availability one way or the other  it'll just make you less attractive to both you know  ya ya ya cos you're not helping matters  i mean it doesn't help you if you know if   you're free on tuesdays and thursdays and to   teach in the schools but what they need is someone   for to   replace for three weeks   no no   it'll never work out it'll never work out on on on a weekly basis  it'll always be a nine day cycle for some word  ya  so uh i think really i should if i'm  gonna going to wait and try and get something through the school board i should just  if if i'm gonna going to wait first it's one decision and then after that i should give myself a date after which it's no longer number one priority  you know where i switch priorities  ya cough   but really i mean if this uh i'm tempted   if this uh if this friend of janis'  if this woman does call and offer me  i'm tempted to take it because   ya depending on the hours that she offers you   ya sure but any minimum number of hours  it's already gonna going to be better than sitting on my ass you know  it's it's { > it's gonna  going to word <   well not in terms of pay  still in terms of net income you know   ya sure ya  it's either it's it's you know it's either   what's the what's the proverb  one bird in the hand or two in the bush   one bird in the hand is better than two in the bush ya   ya you know  but uh  i mean there you've got a sure thing  you you know that you're gonna  going to have so much money at the end of the week or the end of the month  mhh hmm  ya  cough   but uh   and i mean it's  with jack i kinda kind of  feel that  oh i mean the the other two are fine  they're you know they're very pleasant to us but i feel that with cherie there she's a bit sour i mean you know  and again as i say if they find out that  you know i i they they   won't be very keen on  but it's been months since i talked to them   i wouldn't well   i don't see what it is to them  i mean they've got in the contract that you can't go  after their employees after their clients   so   so word   that that shouldn't bother them one way or the other  you know  ya right   that's true that's true   alright   ya   but anyways to get back to camping i mean would  would presqu'&icircumflex;le be okay for you  it's not too far   no if we uhm  you'd have to come back sunday night sunday day   sunday afternoon   ya if we leave friday then that means we'd camp there  friday  that's kinda kind of just overnight really  saturday's the only  saturday's the only sort of full day  full day there  well i mean gustaf tells me that they've gone down to they've gone down to herman island where we were   and camped just for like you know labour day weekend  ya   mhh hmm   and that's a lot further away  sure  but uhm the only thing is tape cuts out for a moment   look at uh name in the window  you can see the dust  if if it's from her or from me and the fridge i don't know but  oh the dust flying around   you can see all the dust flying around  ya   ya ya   but when when did we go to uh what's it called gatineau the gatineau park   last year   wasn't that in september  or it was late august early september wasn't it  mhh hmm  and that was too cold for you  ya it was cold at night  but uhm   well besides the racoons  but this is on the  it's a bit further south  the lake will m make it cold i guess wouldn't it  because it's a peninsula  ya  ya so which is another reason to make it   to sort of go   it's not high   it's not high you know  it's not sea-level but it it's nothing like up in the gatineau hills  so you know it should be warm  ya  so we'll we could go  you know we could go this weekend cos that way we could leave friday morning  mhh hmm  you know it would just force me to get more work done  two words   that's all  you don't have to show your face until monday  mhh hmm  okay  see in that way maybe honestly maybe it would be best  because that way you've got all of friday  you know y you y you  could get up super super early  be out of this town before rush hour starts  yup yup and be back you know and come back sunday  you know   sunday night sure  so what should we do  should we call and find out reserve a place  i guess ya  i think it would be it would be  good i mean if what it will cost   i mean laugh the price of a phone call is better than spending all that money in time and gas   sure cos when you're out there there's nowheres  not " nowhere" else to go out there right laugh   ya right   unless you wanna want to push another two hundred miles down the road to go to that uh  gitchigoumi place we were at last time you know  no no   sand banks  no no no i mean when we went out west  down by  the island you know  down by spanola or whatever it's called  espanola or whatever   oh mani man ma   manitoulin island   manitoulin island   uhm ya  and we do you think we should ask uhm  helene or uh sam   when do they go  i thought they'd be going  when do they go  they leave uh they leave on the eighteenth i think they said  yup next friday  not this friday next friday  look i think it'd be more interesting with  with   uhm we get along fine but i mean with with   more than two people it would be a little bit more interesting  it would be more interesting with more people  i think  ya sure hey i think it   not six  forget six because you'll never coordinate six people's activities you know  well but that's okay i mean it it you know as long as we make it clear that we don't have to coordinate six people's acti activities   if we go down in we're going down in two cars  ya hmm that's true  but uh  you know i mean i don't know uh uh i don't know if  i don't know if if uh if we can't go if just helene and sam can come and we can't fit them in the car i don't know if they'd be willing to rent a car for a weekend you know   i doubt it   cos i mean they're spending a lot  they don't have that much money and they're spending a lot of money on this trip to this trip to scotland  you know it's costing them a hundred and fifty dollars each  a week  to do what  to rent the place right  cos they rented this house or this apartment or  or whatever through this rental agency in edinburgh   mhh hmm   so it's costing them a hundred and fifty dollars each a week  there's four of them  ya  so that's like six hundred dollars a week for the house   the problem with that is i mean why go unless you're going to see the town and get around a bit  cos uh if me uh if i  if i was paying that kind of money a week i'd feel i had to stay put and and get my money's worth from the house that i was in you know  in the house laugh   ya but i mean it sorta sort of sounds expensive but if you think of it it means twenty dollars a night  sure  you know  and you're not going to find in europe  you're not going to find a place   ya well there's no question unless you want to unless you want to stay in youth hos   hostel   u unless you  unless you go in a youth hostel   and then and then what time you come home at night that's  you know and then when you do   when you do get there you got people snoring you've got the  stinky feet  you know   ya i mean it was fine when we were eighteen   ya ya ya   ya ya   no that's not worth it  ya  but  so it's not that it's not so it's not   expensive you know  i mean if you consider that you're sp  it's costing you twenty dollars a night to sleep  sure   cos even if for two you get a room for two  people  eh bed not even   but can they cope there   oh well ya  it's a house  fully equipped and everything  got everything  got a t v a v c r a you know   but if they have plans of renting a car  ya and they also want to rent rent  a car  but wouldn't you need a i mean don't you need an international licence  i don't know how much it's gonna going to cost   i recall   probably   i don't know  maybe you do maybe you don't  how long would you last driving in england  oh i wouldn't  god i can i can hardly  drive here  would you even try   i wouldn't  i wouldn't wanna want to do it  ya i know but well but you know  helene said that they're they'll  be driving on little country they'll be driving out in the country  and it's not that bad  well because maria and and  corey they had rented a car when they had went to ireland  they drove around  and apparently corey said it wasn't it wasn't that bad you know once you get laugh used to having  laugh to drive on the other side of the car and the other side of the road
