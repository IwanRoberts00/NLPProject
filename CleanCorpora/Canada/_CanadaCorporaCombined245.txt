 but you must recognize that a reasonable doubt is not a fanciful doubt or a figment of your imagination   it is not one that we conjure pronounced " con'jure" up to make our job a little easier  reasonable doubt must have real substance  it must be found again upon that good old common sense which i mentioned earlier in my charge  the crown must prove the guilt of the accused as i have said beyond a reasonable doubt and not on the mere balance of probability   if the crown fails to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt then it is your obligation as jurors and your duty to acquit   reasonable doubt has to be an honest doubt  proof beyond a reasonable doubt is that degree of proof which convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience  the law does not require that the charge be proved against the accused to a degree of absolute certainty but if there is a reasonable doubt on anything during the trial and i mean anything it must be resolved in favour of the accused   this applies not only to the ultimate question you must  you must deal with today but applies to all the evidence and to any intermediate questions that you might ask yourselves  as you proceed along towards your verdict   now a very distinguished english juror he put it very   succi succinctly rather than the lengthy definition i gave to you  he says are you certain and i think that's as good a definition as any  if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not to believe a witness the benefit of the doubt must go to the accused   if after weighing or considering carefully all the evidence you have an abiding conviction amounting to a moral certainty that the accused has committed the offence for which he is charged and there're three accused in this case and there can be no reasonable doubt then you must convict  but if you are wavering or if you are unable to come to an abiding conviction or you if you have some lingering or nagging doubt with respect to the proof of some essential element of the offence then you must give that doubt to the accused  and it is your duty to acquit   in criminal trials ladies and gentlemen the jury's verdict  must be unanimous   this does not mean that you must reach a verdict  but in order to reach a verdict of guilty with respect to each of the accused you must be unanimous   to reach a verdict of not guilty with respect to each of the accused you must also be unanimous   if it happens that one or more of you cannot agree with the others after you have conscientiously applied yourself to the task then there can be no verdict and you must then ultimately report that fact  could possibly be 'back' to me   but you must not abandon your own conscience or conclusions just for the sake of reaching a verdict   now in this case i'm satisfied that you will all apply yourselves diligently and conscientiously to the task clears throat and that you'll be able to reach a verdict  but you must bear in mind that the responsibility is on the crown to word establish  the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of each and every one of you   if the accused is to be found guilty each of you individually must agree that sufficient proof and necessary proof has been presented so you can one or two words arrive at that conclusion  now those are my general remarks ladies and gentlemen of the jury  and i'm now going to turn to the word  specific charge that's before you before you   today sound quality drops for approximately next 8 minutes   now the i mentioned the charge and uh it's referred to legally as the indictment and that's the document that you will take into the jury room   when i say indictment i mean the charge  and it reads you'll recall the clerk reading it out at the start of the case  judge reads indictment aloud   now that's the charge   the appicable the applicable provision  of canadian criminal code rest of utterance  judge reads from code   now i'm going to go through very carefully for you the essential ingredients of the offence  word the crown to succeed on the charge  it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following ingredients  one first the identity of the accused and that  two or three words any issue in this case that's for you to decide but they all they all testified   secondly the time and place of the event as set out in the indictment  again that is for you to decide but i don't think we're  going to have any difficulty in respect to the time soft word or pause place  three that the accused applied force directly or indirectly to the complainant sarah   that the accused had intended to apply force to the complainant   and the crown would also have to show that the complainant  sarah did not consent to the application of the  force and that the accused knew that the victim did not consent  and the last ingredient one or two words  is that the assault was of a sexual nature   now i'm going to deal with one or two of the ingredients that need more detailed instructions   one of the ingredients that i talked about was that the crown must prove that the accused applied force directly or indirectly to sarah  and force simply means physical contact  you can be forced without physical violence  in other words this ingredient has proved if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that force was was applied   the next ingredient is the matter of intention   the crown must prove that the accused intended to apply  force to sarah   and if people intend to do things they do them deliberately  it is different when people are careless and do things accidentally   when people do things accidentally they do not intend to do them a few words charge   now the next matter that i want to touch on is what is meant by a  sexual assault  an assault is sexual when the person who commits the assault  does so for the purpose of gratifying his or her sexual appetite  and there's a very recent decision of the supreme court of  canada and i'll read to you two paragraphs to give you a little more detail as to what is maybe a word meant by a sexual assault  the supreme court of canada said judge reads aloud from ruling   the intent or purpose of the person committing the act to the extent which it may appear from the evidence may also be a factor  and when you're considering the business of consent   and i i you should also consider the  word   when a person consents to being touched that consent will only cover the certain amount of touching  it does not cover touching that goes beyond the consent  for example supposing a person agrees to be kissed   that consent would only cover kissing  it does not cover something further for example petting or intercourse   word you're gonna going to have to decide word all the evidence  word consent word this case  now considering whether the conduct was sexual   if the motive of the accused is sexual gratification to the extent that this word appear from the evidence it may be a factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual   now as to this case i agree with all counts although the real issue is whether you believe sarah or the three accused  it is for you to decide whether you accept the evidence of  sarah that roger had intercourse with her without consent  and that peter had anal intercourse again without her consent  and i doubt whether you will have any difficulty in finding  the those two incidents ah that she described  were sexual assault as i have defined it for you here  however the defence evidence is that sarah consented to have intercourse with roger and that the act of anal intercourse with peter never occurred as he specifically denied that he engaged in that activity   therefore the credibility of sarah and the accused  will be the main issue uh at this trial   i therefore intend to review the evidence and with the proviso that if you your recollection is different that mine and you regard evidence other evidence  as more important then it's your recollection or what you deem important in the final analysis uh a few words  facts  the complainant sarah smith when she testified in court now sixteen years of age and is residing in sunny town  sun state   on february the seventeenth of nineteen ninety-two  she was visiting friends in salem   as sarah 's birthday was on march the first  she would've been fourteen at the time the incident occurred   when she was visiting salem she was staying with her friend tara in the hello area in salem   at noon on february the seventeenth sarah and her friend donna jones were having lunch at the hunter's mall  they observed the accused roger rabbit at a nearby  table  although neither sarah or donna knew roger  they made eye contact with him   roger left the restaurant and went to the arcade  and the boys and the girls in my recollection of the evidence they subsequently joined joined   roger gave them his telephone number so that they could arrange to go out later   roger said that both donna and sarah  were in make up and sarah was dressed in a skirt blouse and sweater and was also wearing cowboy boots   after roger returned home the girls tele phoned him  and after some difficulty they found his residence   and as roger did not have transportation the accused  peter dunstan picked them up in his car   as roger received an income tax refund you recall they spent some time driving around trying to cash the cheque  they went to maggie's a local restaurant  where they talked about peter 's birthday   roger 's friend juan orzon was also with them  sarah told roger that she was seventeen and  donna said she was eighteen   juan in jest then asked to see their i d   roger then went to the liquor store and purchased a bottle of sambuca and a case of beer  they eventually went to a residence where peter 's uh friends ta tomas   mike and juan were residing   without revee revealing in detail as to what next ensued it is suffice to say that roger  peter sarah donna and others began to  party   they consumed a large amount of alcohol and sarah  became very intoxicated   from time to time other individuals attended at the residence including the accused ma matthew childs mike nelson and andrea griffin   who was tomas 's girlfriend  roger and peter and some of his friends were smoking marijuana   during the party sarah was dancing with matthew  and others and sometime early in the evening she tore her skirt   she then borrowed a pair of blue jeans from roger   andrea observed sarah clinging to roger   and she said she was very intoxicated   and she said sarah was very loud and from time to time was hugging and kissing roger   tomas said that sarah was intoxicated and on one occasion he observed that she fell in the kitchen and there is also evidence that she fell outside   later that evening many of those attending the party including the three accused sarah and donna decided to visit a local watering hole with the name of streamers'  two or three words   they drove to streamers' in juan 's automobile  on the way to the bar sarah was sitting on roger  's lap and they were necking   sarah was unable to go into the bar as she was underage  she therefore returned to the car and due to her intoxicated condition she slept for over two hours  the partygoers left streamers' at about two a m  and returned to maybe a word place   there i agree with counsel there doesn't   appear to be many or any major conflicts with the testimony between  sarah and the three accused until four or five words  streamers'   sarah testified that shortly after they arrived  roger took her upstairs to a bedroom where peter had been  sleeping   he said he pulled her on the bed and started kissing her   sarah told him no i do not want to do this  she said roger took off his pants and her jeans and that  peter ripped off her shirt and brassiere  sarah said when they went in the bedroom she realized what roger wanted and she made it clear that she did not want to have sex with either peter or roger
