 yes   yeah   so you can try it like that  if you're you flung it around it would be great  if you're not happy   yeah if you got all that tape cuts out   word tape  there is a timeline limit of twenty minutes right  so   yes   yeah so it doesn't really matter   but so  yeah it's whatever we do  and then one of the things i was going to ask  two words is this thing that came home about the  name school for performance  word i didn't get one of those  your son already takes piano lessons so maybe they  word   yeah yeah   um see it's about aptitude and the measure of a child's aptitude to be involved in some musical programme  mm hmm  now i was thinking about it for alice cos  jonathon is really resistant  laugh   i mean he's just not interested   phrase   he even hides the fact that he likes to dance  really  oh yeah  well   and he's got this odd notion that it that it's  feminine too feminine and boys don't do it   oh but he's done some of the dancing for proper name on the stage  yeah that stopped  i think if they catered it more uhm   yeah two to three words   phrase   ah so  but i was thinking about this for alice and i'm not sure  performing arts uhm   word   it's about finding out if the child has musical or artistic interests or abilities  but of course it's not about visual art   uhm so it's about music instruments but they have drama as well  oooh  well i know she's an actress  yeah but your kids are really good with uhm the visual arts word   actually they are  alice 's things are really nice aren't they  yeah yeah   we've got a lot of it at home   phrase   phrase   well she did it through the daycare yeah wow  look at that she did that  it's turned sideways but she did that  wow  that's very mature   but that colour   yes   the colour word     that's a lovely word   it is it is  oh and this one  that was like a trilogy of things she did  yeah  look at that big face  yeah  so   uhm at school or at daycare those  word   daycare i think  isn't that one nice  yeah   she is a two words    i think she did this  well wait a minute  maybe she did those ones at school  uh huh  uhm but she does nice things two words  too  she did that at school  yeah  i think that's really nice   she's really good isn't she   she does   she has a nice sense of uhm of  col uhm   yeah   she's loose with colour and warmth   ya     jonathon is much more into drawing ah  than paint    he's not painterly   uh huh   no   uhm and so like he did these two of the flamingo  yeah  yes it's ah that's more detailed  and they get smaller and more specific  yeah  yeah   yeah   a ha   this is a pretty colour  what is it  that tea  that's that six herb tea  yeah   oh is it really   no no no i think you had it here before  yes charlie takes it to work every day now   they they finally  have it at uhm herb and spice  they've got some in  so but i was thinking in terms of the music   i think alice is very musical  she always listened to music  she's always been singing songs  mm hmm   uh hmm   she makes up little songs about everything and uhm  uh hmm   but you never know   i kinda kind of   we have that piano  mmm  just by accident   i never would have signed him up for lessons   but again he he   went   yeah  he not too bad   never would have thought  never in a million years  right  laugh laugh   so   uhm   out of the blue laugh   so i think i'm word   cept except he's quitting  laugh   he's quitting   why   well he hates that teacher  he can't he can't stand the  the teacher   she's eastern european and very strict and he's working for the grade one royal conservatory exam  and it just has to be absolutely perfect  and a few words   mm hmm   laugh   yeah  he's not a perfectionist  no  so uh next year he's in the french fifty-fifty   we'll stop the piano and we'll debate go for music or going to jen johnson for more relaxed piano lessons   and yeah after that i'll talk to jen and  get two words   oh yeah i see  it's just the teacher  the other teacher was much more relaxed and pleasant and  he enjoyed it more  the teacher means everything  yeah  she's a good teacher oh she's good  he he has to get it exactly his timing and everything has to be and it's rea   it comes out really nicely   but he hates it  he doesn't wanna want to do it  if you could teach them the fine line between the pleasure the child has to take and   loads of pressure loads of word    yeah   yeah that's right   because i know i used to react negatively to too much pressure to do something perfectly  exactly yeah   because sometimes doing it perfectly according to the rule means that you're not being very  you don't feel like you're expressing yourself   right word word    and so there has to be a fine line there   too   and you have to watch too rigidly for the  technique  all of those things you have to instead of just quietly enjoying it you're thinking and counting and watching  the  phrasing   yeah   word   unfortunately you have to have technique because  if you don't have technique it won't look easy when you do it  yeah yeah   laugh   laugh   well a few words   people do  that's what yeah the fantasy is that you sit down  and suddenly you know chopin   just flows through your fingers and into the piano and out it comes and of course it's never like that  word   boom   yeah sigh   but i i  </} used to feel that way with dancing because the kind of dancing i did was highland dancing and it was very rigid and it was very exact and absolutely precise   oh yes i bet   yes   every motion every movement had to be precise as such  yeah  and i was i was quite good  but i could never practise hard enough to do the technique perfectly  because i preferred performing  yeah  i i loved performing   and so i always had you know very appreciative audiences  but i hated competitive dancing  i think you were really just judged on on  technique   and that's right yeah   and so i would i would place   i would do okay but i was never a champion i  think because i had no desire to  be   yeah   yeah   yes yeah   and because it seemed to me that there was something wrong about being competitive about something that i had such an emotional investment in   because surely if you love to perform  it should just come through  and that should be what it is  mm hmm   yes   that's right   yeah  so i think a different attitude drives it   phrase   yeah   it's really tricky uhm  yeah  we were just talking about that cos lenny's friend entered one of his own pieces in the competition the kiwanis  community organization competition  but there were three kids in his category and he came in third   mm   and i was talking to his mom about it how she felt about that  it was interesting  she said well i thought his piece was much more creative but his  technique was nowhere  nobody obviously had coached him and the w   girl who won her technique was just perfect   very difficult and her tech technique  was was   word   oooh  who was this   oh yes yes yes it's very good   th the bright one  yeah  yeah  two to three words very interesting but  well i don't think so   yeah   it's always   words he talks like a  word   yeah laugh   a few words   he has no imagination  well that's the problem  he has no imagination  i'm very boring  laugh   exactly  and callum wants to you know play with  jonathon all the time and and jilly  would like daryn to come over too and play but they just don't play   and so serious in so many different respects kind of  it's as if they don't know how to play  he doesn't really  no  oh   she says he does but i haven't seen him  i had a ton of your stuff out for the little girl   for their little girl   and she just loves it  she and alice would do well together  oh really  how old is she   she two words   uhm four  she's in junior  she went over the day that i had alice in  the garden   mm hmm   and so she had all the stuff out and set it all up and was talking away making this little play and then alice  came over later in the day and took over from the same spot  almost the same little play chatting away and then  alice has a hosil hospital with a  buffalo in it   oooh   laugh a few words   a few words   laugh   sentence   yeah yeah  they chat away and it's very imaginative  and you love to listen   mm hmm   and poor old benny 's reading his adult books  he's so serious  and he's very intelligent  but there   he's got the  rest of his life to do that though  mm hmm   he's gonna going to do that   laugh   well no well no   his intelligence will be a burden but he'll never know it  h he'll they'll put him in  two or three words so at least he'll have some challenge there  then he'll go off and earn mutiple degrees in something or other  she doesn't think she wants him to be a concert pianist  anyway  maybe he should decide  yeah he's got in he's flown   four times in the kiwanis  he's played once  three more times  and we'll see how he does in   he could dance in the kiwanis  really   he could place there too  yeah well   yeah yeah they have all kinds of   phrase   it's good to be involved in those  things   yeah   well i got my first trip to europe because  of because of well we toured  europe and went to paris and all those places and it was wonderful  i know   great   uh huh   uhm   we had a grant actually through somehow with the canada culture  like canadian culture   it wasn't the canada council  it was something  uhm and we did fundraising  and it was it was a wonderful experience that uh yeah word   and how old were you  ah sixteen by then   that's old   i started when i was four  i finished dancing when i was eighteen  sixteen   you kept going  oh yes   word   i have a teacher's certificate  yeah but i mean scottish country dancing  no i don't do it here  i i could  join join a scottish club or something  why haven't you   but parents are heavy heavy into it   i know   oh i'd do it but they don't know the   school i was in   word   you should find a group here it's much better here in ottawa  maybe it is  scottish country yes  it's here one or two words   two words churchill  i feel odd because i don't feel very scottish anymore  i did more as a child because i grew up in that culture  you know   phrase   phrase   phrase so my grandparents are  oh really   my grandparents lived with us  my aunt and uncle were on the next street  i have   your mother came straight over  yes when she was twenty  she was born in glasgow  a few words   oh   she was raised there   oh   so my mother still has an accent  uhm i had a scottish accent when i was little because i was surrounded by this  yeah yeah   my grandfather was the president of burns club  we had scottish people coming all the time  my uncle was the president of the other scottish club  name of club   every second saturday they'd have country dancing   so we did that as well as the highland dancing  ah huh  so   it's a lot of fun one or two words    even thomas is scottish so  uhm   does he did country dancing   yeah he does know a little bit of it but he doesn't like to dance  he's all self-conscious and everything and word    oh that's too bad   but the only time we've ever done it   is once we visited friends of his this was years and years ago in england in a little uhm village  near uhm called chilbolton  i think it was called uhm and it was not far from uh salisbury  and ah they had a barn dance   uh huh   uh huh   uh huh   and english barn dances are really similar to  scottish country dancing  it's line dancing but it's not  it's not that north american swing your partner  stuff kinda kind of  thing but it's like that   yeah word   jigs   yeah
