the sammy garza deal  well a discipline hearing against alan eagleson begins today in toronto   a group that regulates lawyers in ontario filed a complaint against the former hockey czar last november  the law society of upper canada's complaints center around a period of twenty years when eagleson was considered the most powerful man in hockey   he was the head of the n h l players association and an agent for many of the game's top stars  now this will be the first public airing of those allegations against eagleson in canada but as adam bach reports it may not get very far  the law society complaint alleges professional misconduct by eagleson and conduct unbecoming a solicitor  the complaint is a lengthy one it's seventeen pages  in it eagleson is accused of such things as loaning players association money without getting consent and of deliberately misleading certain players including former hockey great bobby orr  the complaint says orr could have become a part owner of the boston bruins but his agent at the time alan eagleson didn't tell him  the law society set aside three weeks to hear from players like orr  and to hear other legal arguments to decide if eagleson should be disciplined he could be disbarred  but the hearing may not last long  eagleson's lawyer daniel kingsman wants it delayed  eagleson faces serious criminal charges in the u s including fraud racketeering and embezzlement and he could be extradited to face those charges soon  daniel kingsman says that has to be dealt with first  that eagleson should have his day in court in the u s before the law society goes ahead with its hearing  kingsman says eagleson has promised not to practice law in the interim  so the eagelson case could be put on hold once again in canada   it's now been more

we're on a a really nice weather stretch  coming up to eight thirty now and the regional news   good morning  well michael smith of kenora ontario has returned to his rightful place among the elite in the world of the decathlon  smith won the bronze medal in this gruelling event ten events in all  he started the second day of the competition yesterday in fifth place but after finishing first in the javelin and discus smith wound up third  michael smith actually did show a lot of promise some years ago but has been hampered by nagging injuries recently however he is back and adds a third medal to the list  a gold and silver going to our hundred metre sprinters now the bronze  and there's a chance for more medals on the way  for instance angela chalmers from victoria has qualified for the final in the women's fifteen hundred metres despite the fact that she's had problems with asthma during her stay in sweden  and angela chalmers here describes her strategy for tomorrow's final  the priority in the final will be to race up to my potential on the day  uhm and to come away from it learning something and to come away from it having enjoyed my experience here  it's been rough to enjoy it this time because i've been struggling so much  and i think that i i you know i can't deny that i'm a real competitor and seeing donovan win the other day was just you know i just sort of had to go wow that must be so incredible i wish i could do that  but you know it's his time and i'm i'm   just gonna going to have to focus on doing my best  and and however that is it's   gonna going to be enough  however while angela chalmers has advanced to the race for the medals fellow canadian leah pells from coquitlam b c was left behind in the fifteen hundred and pells talks about her semi-final  i think it was just a very very tough race  there was uh it was very very aggressive  there was a lot of pack running a lot of getting slammed around and it tends to be almost more uh emotionally draining than physically draining   and you know physically it's almost most   athletes can find it and it's the emotional part you know like  you you just get it hammered right out of you  and in the last home stretch i'm telling you i gave it every single ounce within me and that was all that there was and i'm disappointed that i couldn't find more  really disappointed  well that's part of sports but it's also a learning experience uh being disappointed once in a while  checking the world of baseball  the montreal expos lost five one to the high-flying altanta braves  the braves had eleven hits to
