 we're talking about family allowances basically   mhh hmm   uh if when you read through the this  article this very rather lengthy article   uhm where is it  here   and the thing is uh uh the debate starts about aid to the families  and it's quite a long article  mhh hmm   i'm focused in on the really good stuff here   all right  good   and uh so they they're planning to revamp the entire system the entire social system  mhh hmm  and they want the federal government ment  out of it  as i said there there's this great debate that leads to that and they finally kick them out basically   uh in no uncertain terms and they're gonna going to change everything  mhh hmm   they wanna want to change everything  mhh hmm  because there was there were  developments at the federal level in terms of uhm thinking about a   minimum minimum income and revamping the whole social wel welfare  system which did come after the war  mhh hmm   so this seems to be in anticipation of that and   wanting to have some provincial uhm wa  want wanting to que quebec  to have its own provincial system in place ahead of that  that's right  emphasizing well that's what   songman found earlier on which the french basically ignored which was the federal government attempting to revamp the system  mhh   mhh hmm  and uh they seemed to ignore it up until the point where they just basically say the changes are unconstitutional and they want them out and they want the new uhm new  family allocations with uh little interf   interference little or no interference from the federal government  mhh   mhh  so that's what's going to lead to this  mhh hmm   and this is all taking place feb february    this is february forty- five ya   forty-five ya  february's a pretty pretty hot month for a few issues  okay  uh the next of which  remember i t talked with you previously about uh the fact that uhm the that they the   mayor of montreal has been arrested uh for   tra traitor being a trea  treason   treasonist behaviour cos he basically incited people not to conscript  mhh hmm mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  there's no mention for the longest time and all a sudden here in february forty-five not only do we hear about the mayor being released   you mean he was imprisoned all that time   he was imprisoned all that time  yes he was  uhm   who was the mayor of montreal while  he's   i'm not quite sure  i haven't been able to ascertain that from the articles whether there was like ah  interesting   was there ah you know a a   provisional mayor  was because they talk about him  when he's released they talk about him as the mayor   yes  he did not seem to lose his position  i'm not quite clear  it's very h   so he participated or he did he  incite the riots  he didn't incite a riot  he just told basically in a public speech said  that children of of quebec meaning men age conscription age men  should refuse to to   uhm to sign up basically  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and that was seen some treason or   treason   ya  hmm   and what's funny is it happened so long like i said it was like silent  i knew that it was just a historical fact and i said to myself what happened why it   yes   and suddenly in february forty-five something clicks and all of a sudden it starts  remember i said the debate on conscription hasn't been mentioned for the four years we've been covering from forty-two to  so probably previous to that there was some sort of clamp down  all a sudden it starts again the debate on conscription starts again   there must have been a ban on in the press  on on uh debating conscription  ya   ya probably using uh the war measures act  mhh   uhm you know kind of saying okay we uh   the debate continues   and then there are one two three four various views  under the names of different people here  mhh hmm   now who wha what was that mayor's name michel   camillien houde  oh of course   cos the street's named after him huh   yes   uhm okay   so that's that's a big thing now that  he's he's suddenly gotten out of ja jail gotten himself out of jail and all of a sudden they're talking about the conscription issue again  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  uh i guess with the war winding down people are feeling more confident  and i don't know if they actually let off the   the laws  it's very unclear  they just kind of say that the mayor's out  mhh hmm  uh doesn't mention him there  being any apologies made on any side  mhh hmm   but he's now out and he seems to still be the mayor and and uh   mhh hmm   his term you would think is would have  expired as soon as word in jail   ya i mean he's in jail   ya   but i guess elections were suspended or whatever    ya now this very interesting  this starts uhh in february and in earnest   uh and it's a full page ad  it's ver very  actually hard to copy into our ad cos it's so huge  mhh hmm  it's this thing called a federation of charity  mhh hmm   and this is sort of the first ad that comes up and it's about this guy uhm uhm this honourable maurice trudeau   uh who said that he saw you know poverty and families abandon children  mhh hmm   uh you know uh people being uh uhm uh  you know he saw all these horrible things chi  children poor children   in in things abandonment  mhh hmm   and and uh you know nurseries uh i saw uh poor babies you know sick and and all these terrible things  and what he keeps promising  i saw bad schooling and everything and   and all these different things  mhh hmm   and what he's promising is that he's going to   this federation is going to put money towards fixing these things  they have pictures here  mhh   uhm i think there's a better shot of the pictures where  you see poor children being fed you know kind of like uh babies and mass  two words   mhh hmm   ya soup kitchen two words   ya   so this guy is claiming that he's going to uhm uh uhh help  and you can help  and this is  they want  but but laugh but we need this much money okay   oh ya  and uh  this is uhh this is not associated with the catholic church  no no  this is  i i'm not quite sure what this guy is  quaker   ah here we have now he's actually this   is comes like the next day  we have a breakdown of the costs and the things  that that they need the money for  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   he's explaining what all this money is going to be used for  mhh hmm   aid to the families uh medical to home placement of children which sort of uhm relevant to our uh study uh special diets uh development of existing things uhm uh you know all kinds of social services  mhh hmm   basically it's almost like uh we don't need the federal government  mhh hmm   we're going to create our own secular system cos it's definitely not with the church  mhh hmm   uhm we have here the members of the committee of this  budget   mhh hmm   so we have the names here  mhh hmm  but it's it's basically  charity for canadian french canadians   yes   it's like they're saying we're going to create our own social system  secular privatized  social system   mhh hmm   yes   mhh hmm   that's important because up to now there's been a protestant  english - language system for charity and there's been a  a catholic church run system and so this is really uh  quite remarkable   and it just goes on   i mean this is then then   a couple days later you get this one which is actually the picture word from that  this is the picture which i thought is just so  oh my goodness that hand   i look at that   look at it  isn't it horrible laugh   a few words   hand of poverty and   and destitution   and dark  coming  out of the darkness   don't you find in this   it's it's the  french  it's french canadian   you won't find it in the english papers  no they don't talk about it  mhh   so we've come up with this  this alternate uh social system and it's the french taking care of the french  mhh hmm   and they you know really acting like they are a nation within a nation   by themselves is the main thing   ya   you talk about totally different stuff    ya   i have no clue what laugh you're talking  about because they don't talk about  it in the english   that's right   mhh hmm mhh hmm  these are french canadians saying we've got to take care of our own and we're gonna going to   you know and we need your money   no   and it's funny cos when you follow it   they do they never do get all the money that they needed  they   well it's going to it's going to as it sounds like they had some grand schemes but did  did any of it come to pass   it peters out  there's just nothing  uh that's forty   uh when was that  uh february   uhm   and uh there's dates on some of them  uhm  yes february forty-five  okay  what ends up happening is is it just sort of peters out  it doesn't seem to pan out  mhh hmm   they just k   k kind of the ads get smaller and smaller as the amount  now by laugh the second week they're down to things like this   ah   and uh i'm not quite sure what happens to these people  mhh hmm  it just kind of stops mentioning them  mhh hmm  but really a a big focus on children  throughout the campaign  it seems   yup   yup   so they have like an alternative system that again it's just like they are in total contempt of the federal system  they're just trying to a act  as if it's not happening  mhh hmm  this this sounds like you know there is no social system in in service that there's no social services in in place and they're going to create them as if the federal one isn't even in exi existence   mhh hmm   it's just kind of like   ignored   mhh hmm   or other private ones  ya  here this this is interesting  this is uh uhm a bit more about uhm educating parents  and uh you know it's it's   back to this whole idea of ah  oh yes   it's not actual reference to the uh parents' school which   we get at saint henry which we've seen before  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  this seems to be references to uh just generally we have to take care of our children and it's our responsibility  ah so again sort of ah discounting the role of   of the federal government and their importance  mhh hmm   and it like it's our problem and uh   mhh hmm  and is this the church saying this   no   uhm the the   abb&eacute;   oh yes  mhh  mhh hmm  okay  okay now remember the tramway problem  remember the asking for scab labour  yes   well it's really funny because   the funny thing is that shortly after that little thing they're talking about the strike and then they're talki  talking and then they have that ads in the classified for women   to work them and uh you don't hear anything about it for months and months and months and then all of a sudden laugh  first comes this one  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i love this this one   laugh   two problems in montreal prostitution and the trams   laugh   laugh some people would still agree   how can you compare the two   laugh   laugh so that's seen as a   laugh a new issue  let's have some air   uhm   prostitutes prostitution  and trams now what what's the problem with the trams  is it still the strike   it's still the strike  it's still the strike   they've been on strike now for several years  it seems locked out  a long time ya
