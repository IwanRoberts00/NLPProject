 introduction of speaker   that's right that's the uh the interesting thing about uh what we're we're   talking about today  it's so far we have many titles to choose from  i uh i gave them the  the title uh nobody said it was going to be easy   and uh kimberly was much more optimistic  she had how to succeed your first year  and uh maybe i dunno don't know i'm uh   if o if i could do it over again and laugh in reflection on on the first year of teaching so ah  i think what it w what it comes down to is is uh is a sharing uh idea of uh what is a first year of teaching and uh what it represents the stress it represents and uh a lot of the uh the  workload that it represents  and uh my experience through it and how i went through it  and   there'll probably be things which will be similar for you but it'll be you know probably different as well depending on what your situation's  gonna going to be compared to mine  and the way i word this is a very loose kind of outline okay and uh if there's anything that you would like to talk about too you know if you can a you can ask at any time if you want because i like to see this as more of a discussion than you know a lecture   ah   so we're gonna going to start with after the job interview which is uh the situation is  you now have your job okay  we're not worried about uh you know how you get a job and your job situation  what i'm talking about is you have a job okay  you went to your job interview er it went well and now they say okay now we're gonna going to give you the method   here's your classroom  you are a teacher okay  and uh the way i felt about after i had the job interview  and and i i  walked out  at first you feel very you know you're very happy that you  have it but at the other side you feel like uhm kind of like an imposter   because you don't you had the job interview and you talked about you know whatcha what you're gonna going to do if there's a discipline situation  you talked about whatcha what you're   gonna going to do if with   the programming  you talked about how you're gonna going to   teach english and everything but you didn't act   you haven't actually done it yet   you know what i mean  so now you're actually gonna going to  have to do it so laugh   you come to the now you you there's a   kind of a week period in which you start in school before you actually get into class into classes in which you have you know ped pedagogical days  teacher-only days right you have like about a week of ped  pedagogical days in which you you're   you're thinking about this over and over again what are you going to do and how are you going to deal with it   and what i want to tell you is that you better know  ah laugh you better know what you're going to do uh before you you step into the class and don't count on these ped pedagogical days  okay don't count don't think that they're gonna going to give you time okay after your job interview  don't think they're going to take care of you in a very big way  okay  you're on your own in that sense okay  and the thing that i i found very very difficult when i started teaching was the amount of meetings was the amount of meetings that we had okay  you had five days and they basically had five days of meetings  okay  they had no time to actually prepare   because you're walking into a situation in which most teachers  especially today in the situation in quebec most teachers have like at least fifteen years of experience up till twenty years  they don't need a week to prepare their first day of school  you know they know what they're going to do  so for them it's sort of well what are we going to do with this time so quite often they have meetings and and  they discuss how they're going to prepare uh the schedule for example or they might talk about rules in class and word rules in the school  uh they might talk about presence how we're going to deal with uh the papers  or what are we gonna going to do about uhm recycling and  things that for you have no you know what are you going to do  on your first day  the most important meeting which is the meeting in which you're gonna going to meet the students  how are you going to to meet the students  what are you going to say to the students   you have to think about that  that is your priority  and what happens is that when you're going to come in for after the job interview and it's your first few days the first thing you're gonna going to realize is that  every school no matter which school you go to every school has its way of  being has its political structure  you have your unions  you have your different   if you go to a big school you'll have different departments  okay  if you go into a village you'll have families  you know like there's the the tremblays  and the and you know they have all the  d&eacute;panneurs quebec word for corner store and  the the you know the the the the gaud  the the gaudreaux have the have the gas station and they hate the tremblays and  you know there's there's a whole bunch of things that you don't even know when you walk into a situation  and if you go into a big city like montreal there's probably political situations which you don't know about which   you you just don't know about   and you're kind of like a laugh i  kinda kind of see it as as   you're you're very vulnerable  laugh starts   let's put it that way okay  you're vulnerable laugh ends   and when you go in uh there'll be different people who  wanna want to bring you onto their side  okay there's somebody let's bring him onto my side  let's bring him onto my side  the principal hey buddy you know   you're a good guy  be on my side   and then you're gonna going to walk into to teachers' office and oh that guy is such a jerk you know  you don't wanna want to have anything to do with him you know  you know we all hate him and you know what he did and  and s so you're very torn between this  and then you have the union who come in and go you know you're a member of the union now and and things you have to deal with  you have to deal with the union  so you have many many uh pressures that you don't even  know how to deal with at first  and in i believe you don't really you should not deal with that right away   y'know you know if i if i had something if i could do it over again going into my first day of teaching going into a new school i would i wouldn't  i wouldn't say very much you know  i would have my thing   if if you have all these meetings well  you're gonna going to have to prepare your  first meeting with your students  how are you gonna going to deal with those students  and that's that's the most important thing   okay what are you going to say to the students when you first meet them  because half of your year okay at least is  dictated by the first five minutes that you meet the students  it sounds uh exaggerated but it's not okay  the impression that you give to your students on the first day of classes is extremely important okay  and what happens is that we get a lot of kind of   we get a lot of advice okay you won't be missing any advice   except you get kinda kind of strange advice so getting advice like don't smile   okay when you meet the students don't smile  be very strict when you meet the students okay uh  don't talk to them about your life  don't  you know you get all these kind of things that you shouldn't do   but you don't get very much of what you should do okay and how  you should meet the students  and the thing is is that when you meet the students for the first time uhm they don't know who you are okay and they don't know that you don't you know that you have  no experience as a teacher okay  laugh starts they don't know that yet laugh ends   okay  that's a gr that's a they'll find out  audience giggling throughout this   that they'll find out soon enough  but they don't know that yet okay and so  and if they do know that you're a new teacher they do know that you're a brand new teacher they don't know if you're a good teacher or a bad teacher okay  they'll pick these things up   they pick these things up very quickly okay so   but they will know who you are okay  students will pick up who you are in a very real sense of the meaning okay  as a university student we're very polite  we have a we believe in distance and uh we believe in respecting other people  unive uh students primary  secondary students they're going to know who you are as a person  and they analyze everything  they look at you and they pick up everything   and things that you never thought about like that you forgot about for years as a university student or you know they snapping fingers starts pick it up like that within a second snapping fingers ends   you know things that maybe you hestitate when you speak  maybe you wear glasses  maybe you know th   things you never really thought about all of a sudden ah ha you wear glasses  you know yeah okay well  it's very yeah it's   and it it but it builds onto that  you know   so when you meet them for the first time you have to make them realize that you are a teacher  that's who you are  and they are students   okay you are not uh their buddy   you're not their friend   you're not their parents you're not their mom or their dad  that you're not their uh scapegoat  they don't get to push you around  you're their teacher  okay so that's what you have to show  but at the same time you have to know what is a teacher  what is your definition of a teacher   because they're saying to you after your job interview you are a teacher   but are you a teacher  do you believe that you're a teacher after your job interview   loud banging noise followed by audience nervous laughter   do you believe that  do you believe loud banging again that you're a teacher after your job interview  audience member responds   how long do you think it takes to be a teacher  if i was to say the number of word well  from from whatever  if i say a time how much time do you think before you can say i'm a teacher   audience member responds   a lifetime some audience laugh   do you believe it's a lifetime  different audience member responds   after two years   different audience member responds   okay   same audience member responds   so do you believe in a sense that when  after your job interview you are a teacher  in that sense  same audience member responds   even before  same audience member responds   that's interesting   same audience member responds   no  same audience member responds   that's right  that's that instinct 's good  it's sort of a i i   and that   it's true our i you know you're sort of naturally a natural born teacher you know  three or four words natural born killer  audience laughs   a natural born teacher  and uh and a lifeline a lifelong   experience  and we have a about after two years  uhm  i asked that to uh when i started teaching  uh another teacher friend of mine said when i   when i started teaching he said you know the first   first couple of weeks is gonna going to  be tough  you know the the kids are  gonna going to test you  you know   and then i went to see my conseiller p&eacute;dagogique  you know the c p con uh the pedagogical advisor  and he said uh the first couple of months you know   that 's pretty tough you know  you know that's a tough couple of months  and then i and then i saw uh i met  another teacher  other word i think he was actually two or three words audience laughs   i'm not somebody said i'm not i don't remember and they said the first year is very very tough  the first year you know  well then i started losing more and more you know  and then i went to a speed confere how   i went to co-operative learning and uh met a teacher there and he said ten years  two or three words ten years before you can say that i'm a teacher i know what i'm doing  you migh you have experience you know what it is  and the more i think about it the more i i  would agree with with him in the sense of it takes it takes a while
