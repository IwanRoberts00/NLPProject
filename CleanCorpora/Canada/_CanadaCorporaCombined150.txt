 mister speaker that is very strong endorsement from the province of nova scotia  lastly i would like to refer to the representation made by the representatives from new brunswick and alberta governments who kindly answered uh the invitation that was made to all provinces to appear in front of the standing committee on h r d human resource development   this is what mister smith from new brunswick responded to a question from the m o from m mercier as to whether the bill was an intrusion into provincial jurisdiction   french quotation, 20 seconds   he added that the federal-provincial agreements provided for in the bill as well as the enhanced administrative and technical  co-operation the bill would lead to a further guarantee of continued federal provincial full co-operation with respect to designation of authority  this is what mister hemmingway from alberta commented  i think one of the problems we have today in relation to the federal loan program is discrepancies between and amongst provinces with respect to which institutions may be designated   i know that the federal concern has been given that it's a national program  the benefits should be reasonably equal across the country  we are presuming and it is our understanding that we will have a great deal of input in developing the designation criteria that will be put in place and that those criteria would be negotiated on ongoing basis between the two levels of government   mister speaker to me it what this legislation clearly indicates is that if there is one single group of people that are against this legislation are the members of the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois   and so uh i want to perhaps mister speaker now to return to  to the specific issue the specific uh motion  and to tell you that we as a as a government are committed to providing consistency and fairness under our student assistance program   the amendment presented uh would repeal subsection four two and four three of the bill which provide the minister with the flexibility to establish policy directives  and mister speaker i think that if we are to look at this in a very clear and rational way there is nothing wrong with the federal minister having something to say about a federal initiative a federal policy  there's absolutely nothing wrong  it is within his right and may i say it is his duty and obligation to make sure that he has something to say about the policy initiatives the policy direction under the this particular act  and so i fail to understand and i have spent a great deal of time trying to figure it out exactly what the opposition is saying and trying to follow a logic of the opposition but perhaps the problem is not one of logic  perhaps the problem here goes above and beyond that  it's a question of vision   but for the moment mister speaker i'm not here and i'm not going to engage myself in a constitutional discussion  the reason why i am debating today is because there are hundreds of thousands of students who are awaiting this program provinces awaiting this program part-time students students with disabilities women who want to pursue doctoral studies students who have  been victimized by heavy debt load  this is the issue that we are debating today   it is for this reason that i simply cannot support the amendment as proposed by the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois   the mister speaker the government must be in a position to ensure that the policies which are developed are applied consistently across the country  it would uh appear that the opposition is not overly concerned  about treating students fairly throughout canada because of their own political agenda  therefore mister speaker i tell you on behalf of the thousands of students who are awaiting this program on the thousands of students in need  who want to acquire the skills to be competitive to acquire the life skills necessary to meet the challenges of the new economy acquire the education that is part and parcel of life today as we live through a learning continuum as we engage in life-long life-long  learning it is fundamental that we support these students  and it is for that reason that i will not be supporting the motion presented by the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois audience applause   the honourable member for medicine hat   cough thank you very much mister speaker  i rise to oppose this motion from the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois  seems to me that the provinces have spoken with one voice on this issue   they had a chance to speak up on bill c twenty-eight  they came before the standing committee on human resources development to talk about this particular piece of legislation and in every case they have suggested that they will go along with this legislation and that they are in support of it  we can't start giving carte blanche to provinces including quebec simply because que  quebec uh the members down the way demand it  we must be respectful of what the provinces themselves are saying  even in the case of quebec  they have indicated that they're quite comfortable with this particular piece of legislation  people in alberta are happy with it  people in the maritimes are happy with it  i don't really understand the paranoia down the way  i can only assume that there ares there are   other reasons uh for this motion coming up than the one stated  having said that mister speaker we cannot support this motion and we will be saying more however down the road about some of the problems inherent in bill c twenty-eight  french introduction   french, 11 minutes applause   french introduction   french, 11 minutes applause   short french statement raising motion   all those in all those o  opposed please say nay audience responds " nay"   short french statement   the uh pursuant to standing order seventy-six point one the recorded division in the motion stands deferred.  short french statement   french, 11 minutes applause   the honourable member for beaches-woodbine  thank you mister speaker  the honourable member is right when she says that thirty  per percent thirty years   is a long time  and we've had this program for thirty years  federal co-operation federal-provincial co-operation has existed under the student loan act for thirty years and the co-operation and support continues to to   happen  we heard from the parliamentary secretary just recently earlier today that in fact the provinces in this country do support this act  and this is very important  mister speaker under this bill provinces will continue to be able to opt out of the federal student assistance program if they choose to offer their own program to student assistance  there's nothing new here  opted out provinces will be able to receive compensation if they have a program which is substantially the same has substantially the same effect as the federal program  this is nothing new again  the government is simply carrying forward provisions from the previous act  moreover mister speaker we are expanding uh provisions for compensation to provinces which choose to opt out to ensure that their students benefit from the proposed reforms   this i think is a positive initiative  we are also providing for accountability  this is something that i believe is very critical if we are to be accountable to the taxpayers of this country mister speaker  accountability is something that the taxpayers have asked us to make sure that we do  for this reason we are asking those opted out jurisdictions to satisfy the minister that they have in place a program that has substantially the same effect as the federal program in order to receive compensation  surely mister speaker this is only responsible and reasonable   this can be accomplished by a simple letter once a year from non-participant provinces  it is not an onerous detailed demand  it is a simple letter of response and communication  it is not terribly demanding  section fourteen seven mister speaker establishes that a province choosing to opt out is compensated for those program elements which are in place at the provincial level  without section fourteen seven an opted out province could be compensated for program elements which are not available within that province  to me mister speaker that would not be responsible  we must be accountable and continue to be accountable to the taxpayers  we would increase the government cost without any assurance that students are receiving the benefits provided for under this legislation  again mister speaker i believe that it is important in this country and we have discussed it for the last eight months accountability in how we spend the federal tax dollar is very important  the provinces have agreed with the provisions in this in this uhm in this act   and they've agreed to the provisions because they feel comfortable that in fact their jurisdiction is not being affected that they are   pro protected under the the uh the uh constitution and that this is a s  co-operative process working together for the benefit of the students of this country and in and and in  doing so ensuring that students across canada will receive the same programs and have the same access to good programs for post-secondary education  so mister speaker i really see nothing new and nothing terribly uh earth shaking in the in in these changes and i believe that they are for the benefit of canadians  therefore i would say mister speaker that i suggest that this motion is out of order  if the motion stands i would urge all members to vote against it  thank you mister speaker  the honourable member for medicine hat  thank you very much uh mister speaker   a previous speaker i should say an earlier speaker refued  referred to the duty of the opposition when uh  when the opposition looks at legislation such as we have before us today  i think it's incumbent upon the opposition to give the legislation a thorough vetting and when one comes across a clause that they're uncomfortable with to check it out to consult the stakeholders to find out what the different opinions are on it  and after having done that if they are satisfied that the stakeholders don't have any particular problem with it then they shouldn't oppose it for the sake of opposing it  and i point out the members in the bloc that although the government of quebec was invited to come before the h r d committee to talk about this they did not  they are comfortable apparently with this particular clause of the bill  they have the ability of course and have taken advantage of the ability to opt out of uh of this of the  previous act and presumably of this one as well  i think it's very important that the opposition picks its time and place to make a big deal about these things   but to cry wolf too often mister speaker only guarantees that you will have no audience when it's really important   i was very suspicious throughout the entire uh meetings that we had with respect to this bill about uh some of the intentions of the government  i wanted to ensure that the provinces' rights weren't being tampered with that they weren't being in  infringed upon  but in looking at it and after talking to all the people involved talking to the ministers their departments rather and their officials  they don't have concerns  i don't understand why we're even talking about this given the fact that even the government of quebec doesn't seem to have any concerns  mister speaker for the uh in the  interest of expediency i would hope that we will uh defeat this motion  french introduction   french, 10 minutes   french introduction   french, 9 minutes   french introduction   french, 10 minutes   french introduction   french, 11 minutes   french introduction   french, 11 minutes   french introduction   french, 10 minutes   french, closing debate   the honourable member for kindersley-lloydminster  applause   uh thank you very much mister speaker  uh scandals and unfounded allegations and unanswered questions have plagued government and parliaments throughout our history and certainly the prime minister's statement this morning was welcome in   n need in light of our past history  in his speech this morning on integrity in government the prime minister claimed that the power of the ethics counsellor will prevent deals like the pearson airport privatization from happening again  so my question to the prime minister is what is there about the pearson deal that the ethics counsellor would prevent   the hon honourable   right honourable prime minister  a deal like that will not occur not laugh  because the government will never sign ah a deal that like that
