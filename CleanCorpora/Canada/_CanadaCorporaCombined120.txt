 good morning  beautiful morning out there isn't it right now   isn't it glorious   it's that red red sky  yes  yeah uh we got a beautiful cityscape on our ah traffic monitor right now which isn't s showing  traffic  but that's no problem because there's no traffic to show really  to speak of laugh   mhm   fine then we'll take the pleasant city view yeah     all the routes into town working very well right now  from the west island southshore and laval  ah no delays accidents stalled cars to report on the metropolitan or c&ocircumflex;te de liesse or d&eacute;carie expressway  just ah one thing off island down the uh jean-lesage autoroute again  unfortunately uh this not quite so serious an accident as we   re reported yesterday and it's also a bit closer to montreal at sainte-rosalie which is about one hundred and forty kilometres east of montreal uh  a two car accident there and apparently one injury but again not as serious as the other one that we reported yesterday  also it is uh these things seem to come in  in   batches like this   it's odd though two days in a row i mean you rarely uh    waves yeah   uh when we had problems oh on the island of montreal uh uh on the  twenty again at woodland they   they came in a batch and so uh it's just the way things work it seems  so well let's hope that the uh if there is a problem there will be co corrected     same word mmm yeah   we'll hope this is the last of many   there is a lot of construction going on on the uh jean-lesage autoroute  these days   mhm   in fact in sainte-rosalie we had one lane closed yesterday i don't know if it was closed overnight or not  i'll check into that  so people might wanna want to  watch it if they're heading out today  yeah that might cause confusion   now is that your theme music jeanne   the leafing through the paper music   mhm   i don't know it's very uhm courtly i guess   i it would be   suitable   i guess   except that this morning i wanted to open with a sports story   uhm   so i guess it's not directly i guess you couldn't say that word not really the adequate scene for that  but anyway it's uhm again the story of bruny surin and donovan bailey and it's the lead story in la presse local newspaper with a big photograph of the two guys smiling  from mi you know from  ear to ear and the the lead is uh is  ils s'entendent comme la comme des larrons en foire   now the word larrons i had to go and consult with our french colleagues  it's a kind of an uh a mediaeval term meaning uh something like the court jester  so these two guys clearly are having a great time  that's what the la presse is suggesting  it says that they're friendly rivals who are proud to be the first  double canadian winners in track   and that they had two golds in the swedish competition to prove that they're the best in the world and to put the ghost of ben johnson to rest   that's a ghost that's been hanging around since nineteen eighty-eight  and ah they're very much enjoying being treated like international stars in sweden  mmm mmm   it's lively it's lively   mhm   not a natural link no   beau-   mmm   oh   mhm   mhm   ah well they really do look like they're glowing  it's funny yesterday there was some comment from another athlete who said you know i'm sure bruny isn't too disappointed and i thought yeah i didn't see disappointment exactly   laugh   word pretty enjoyable all round   no word looked pretty happy   yeah i think he's really enjoying being the   the centre of attention over there   uhm in the gazette and the globe as well as on the front page of le devoir local newspapers the uh the story of the serb refugees in the krajina ah  and the  number being quoted is a hundred and  twenty thousand in the gazette  hmm   next wave   gee hmm   ah croatia says its three day military operation to take over the krajina is over and they will now clear out ah the five thousand serb rebels left  ah this the ah this is an attack that shocked the world  the croatian army ah you know unexpectedly well-prepared and ah  aggressive here  and ah there are reports of attacks on serb refugees by croat troops according to the international committee of the red cross  and looting of towns  so it it's really a conflict in which there don't seem to be any good guys  ah it's very hard to ah to understand  that's just it even ah as you look at the different sides  and i think that's what's so discouraging about it is uh  no lines drawn  no there's no no one has the moral high road on this one   no no  ah in le devoir the lead story  quebec's youngest politician mario dumont twenty-five years old on the pre-referendum campaign trail and he's sort of on the damage control trail i guess you could say the lead the title is  dumont will respect the tra- tripartite  agreement   this is an agreement that was arrived at in june between the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, the p q and dumont's action d&eacute;mocratique  political parties in quebec   and last week he got himself into a bit of hot water when he told  le devoir he was uneasy about the proposed bill that the p q has put forward that would declare quebec sovereign  he wants a vote on sovereignty specifically and wants a negotiating committee that would include federalists on it and this was very upsetting to uh montreal p q activists some of whom threatened to resign  uhm so uh he's hel called a newser  to clarify this and he said that he'd like parizeau to modify the proposed bill to include the terms of the june agreement and he wants a sovereignty partnership with canada &aacute; la bourassa  just so funny about dumont i the photo of him on the back page of the front section of the devoir   he looks like bourassa   he even st he's even standing there with his the tips  of his fingers together   it's quite hilarious i i must say  anyway so uh  he well definitely a follower  hmm mm   oh   he words mannerisms that's right    yeah he seems a student of his   but yeah ah week by week uhm i- it's   back and forth with him certainly isn't it  uh the signing there wa- wasn't  uh a word mentioned of any any kind of uhm problems with whatever he was signing on for and then suddenly a little distance from it and now no no it'll be fine it's just a few changes   he's having reservations yes yeah   and the reaction of the media to this whole thing is interesting  it's the top of the full story in le devoir  it's not mentioned in la presse and it's buried in the gazette laugh so   oh yeah way deep in a tiny little mention   people fighting the uh the uh  referendum agenda oh   well i think there'll be a lot more stories of that nature to come   i think so yeah  la presse uh has a- on   the front page also the a weird story with a big photograph that also got a a big play in  le journal but not in uh not in the   english media  uh these two sort of dingy looking characters being arrested by the tactical squad in scott junction just south of quebec city near  sainte-marie-de-beauce   now this is the community where the undertaker  the local undertaker killed his daughter and the police chief and then himself just a little while ago  unfortunate community  entirely too many ah strange and uh dismaying laugh  stories coming out of that region there's somthing about it  mmm   and this is a this is a sect apparently  these two guys are gonna going to be accused of kidnapping and confinement  uh the police uhm found a seventeen year-old girl and her sister  who'd been reported disappeared inside a compound called the  domaine moreau which is like a sa uh   th the presse  describes as a stone bunker-like structure surrounded by barbed wire  very odd story which i'm sure we'll be hearing some more about  mmm   hmm mmm  in la presse an exclusive story concerning haiti a country we haven't heard too much about in the news in the last week or two  bishop willy rom&eacute;luse of j&eacute;r&eacute;mie which is on the far western part of the island uhm  and also this uh this was a person who was uhn nominated for the nineteen ninety-five nobel prize  he's the only church leader in haiti to oppose publicly  to have opposed publicly raoul c&eacute;dras's military uh junta  he's in montreal for a couple of days  he's be he'll be staying at the well-known uh french-speaking quebecoise actor's actress'  ang&egrave;le coutu's place  and uhm speaking and doing work on behalf of his uh his parish in haiti  he also opposed the vatican which recognized the government of c&eacute;dras  a very courageous man  and he's not officially being received by the quebec church but only uh by the haitian community  and of course there are forty thousand haitian quebecers here in montreal  so interesting story that no one else picked up on  in le devoir a review of the uh  francofolie festival again  and fran&ccedille;ois panier the reviewer calls it an  unorthodox francofolie festival  he says the conseille de la langue fran&ccedille;aise  french language promotion council is nowhere to be seen  and uh this is a good thing  and he talks about word a sixty-three year-old french from france folky who ah had a who performed  last night and said from the stage c'est en anglais j'ai le droit   he asked permission to sing in english  sorry he said it so- somewhat  sarcastically  and he went ahead and sang blowing in the wind in english  and uhm le devoir this reveiwer  is happy to say that the festival is multilingual  there's uh kashtin singing in montagnais there's afiletta singing in corsican and he's happy to see this mixture of language and cultures  something of an evolution for the francofolie then  new and different and very happy about that  and apparently aufrey is known for his translation of  goodnight irene which is translated to be  rosinne bonsoir which i i don't think i've ever heard  no that's odd   laugh so uhm and finally in  la presse also another musical story about the casavant uh pipe organ uh company in sainte uh ya  sainte uhm  just a sort of a feature profile of this company and the title is casavant paying a prosperous air   laugh   this is the organ that uh this is the organ company that built the organ in the saint-jean-baptiste church in the plateau district on rachel   word yeah   they're renowned around the world for uh for their uh incredibly uh uhm successful uh attempts to modify and update the pike pipe organ but using the original uh p- plan and original materials  they have seventy-five employees and they export eighty to ninety percent of their instruments all around the world  all over europe and ak- apparently  their big uh success right now is exports to japan where there's great interest in pipe organ music  ah extraordinary  well thank you very much and uh someone will be back with us   word     and good night alana laugh   good night jeanne laugh   we'll just uhm go back for a second to the francofolie which is uhm running all this week certainly in montreal  uhm we've got a little of the sounds of the francofolie uh  a song from uh danny boudreau who will be playing tomorrow at les midis in complexe desjardins  ah this is a song called un peu de pluie   song   ah such expressions of tenderness and devotion from danny boudreau  ah a performer from ah new brunswick who'll be playing at the francofolie  he's uh taking the stage tomorrow at noon at  complexe desjardins les midis complexe desjardins   uhm lovely song from him certainly we're all swaying and flicking our bics lighters here
