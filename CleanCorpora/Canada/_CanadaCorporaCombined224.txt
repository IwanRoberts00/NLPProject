 i'll be nice   i'll be nice  i promise  i didn't know that they they grounded him for a month before  i said no i have to  i have to call your parents and you have to  audience members comment and laugh   i wrote down his phone number and i go and i call his parents but it was busy so that ah forget it  and they called and i i didn't call back  and the next day i saw him he was like thank you laugh starts thank you laugh ends with a sigh of relief audience members laugh   it was it was uh a okay  audience member comments   sure  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   definitely  audience member comments   definitely  audience member comments   definitely  audience member comments   wow  audience member comments   yeah sure   audience member comments   that's different yeah   audience member comments   but that's uh   and i think that's uh i think the important point here is the warning that you're giving  we're talk talking   we're still in the beginning of the year here   you're at the warning of the st   student of to the student   audience member comments   and the parent   audience member comments   sure  audience member coughs   yeah   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   oh yeah definitely  audience member comments   sure  audience member comments   mm hmm   and and what goes on is this kind of blaming game  audience member agrees   there's never any blaming game that goes on in the teacher's knowledges and and and it's the idea of let's blame the parents  let's blame the direction uh you know  but it's time that that you take uh  your own responsibility for your class   you know if you take that that that idea of a student who is failing or or you know who's having a problem you call them  i tell you it's incredible the help that you get from the parents  word   word there's no more strong   there's no more stronger political tool in the education system in my point than than the parents  if you have the parents on your side you're laughing   you know your bosses your your your  principal might be against you the school commission might be afraid of it  but if the parents are with you laugh   and that happens i i've seen it over and over again   uh but staying with discipline  okay i'm gonna going to tell you that there's different kinds of of uh of students  okay   there's the ones which that will work very well   there's one warning after class letter of apology  you can get this letter of apology   and it says you know i'm sorry dadadadada  the kid's gonna going to be great  word   you're gonna going to have that   it's gonna going to happen     audience member comments   ask for it in french  and and it and it's   gotta got to be sincere   with some  i'm talking about a certain amount of student   students   there're students who who fool around and they realize that it wasn't right and they're  gonna going to be sincere and saying they're sorry and they're gonna going to be okay  they might even give you a good reason   which happens  you know there could be something a good reason   then there's the second type of student   who can be okay but you have to keep reminding  them   okay   you're gonna going to   ha have you're gonna going to  it's gonna going to  work  but you're gonna going to have to maybe do it two or three times during the year   and you're gonna going to have to be more you know straight   okay that's another type of student   okay you're gonna going to write a report   you're gonna going to write the the the dossier   you're gonna going to call the parent  and you might have to write another dossier and bring it  to the principal and say there must be something done about this student   okay   this student needs a more severe warning   okay   this student might just need to be suspended from school okay  this student might just need the meeting with parents   okay  it's a student who has more problems  that's the second   but they still can you know they still function and but every once in a while friday afternoon  that kind of thing  then there's the third category okay   they are what i would call in the true sense of the meaning  the rebels  the ones who hate school   who have to go to school   and who just want to fool around   and who know the system well enough because they've been in trouble most of the time that they know how to s   they know how to slide three words  audience member coughs   you better know you better be on your toes   cos they'll they'll just swim around you you know  and one minute you'll say something and they'll   they'll get you on another thing on a detail  i never said that   you never did that   you didn't write it down   they know the fiche  they know what you have to write down   they know all these things   okay  you you're not allowed to make me do that  dadadada dadada   very complicated school word student to deal with   i had a student like that   i had more than one student like that   and there're not many though okay  there there aren't that many okay  uh it's a category in which uh you know oh not again category   and you're gonna going to have to deal with this student   okay and it comes down to this   this is what i want  yes  audience member tries to say something   okay   this is what i want to tell you about this student and what to do about this student okay as a teacher   okay if you have this student in your class   what do you do about this student   have a discussion with the student  you sit down   and you say   i don't know what to do with you anymore   okay i don't know what to do   i've tried everything   i don't know what to do   i'm gonna going to ask for you to be suspended from school   and i'm gonna going to do everything in my power to get you out of my class   because you have the right to education but so do the other students in my class   and it's not you who's gonna going to  stop that   and then you speak with the principal   you write a letter to the school commission   saying for the right of education for the other students you do not accept this student  i do not accept this student as a teacher   it's a hardline kind of approach   but it definitely   you've ren   what you're doing is you're telling the student if you don't like school then get the hell out   you know what i mean  that's what you're telling the student   i'll respect you if you get out of my school if you don't   wanna want to stay   or stay and follow the rules   you know what i mean   but what we do is we we kind of  play around with with these students  we let them get off we let them be okay  we word i'll give them another chance give them another chance give them another chance give them another chance give them another chance until it's  until you're a joke basically   you know they don't e they just laugh at you if you think about   what you're doing is making the kid make a decision   are you gonna going to stay are you gonna going to go   and i had a student like that and and   he decided to stay   and the contract you sit there you don't say a word   like other students   there're students who are like that you know calm students  they sit down they don't say a word they listen they do their work  and that's what you do   if they have a question they'll come and ask you   that's just for the third type   do you have any other questions about uh   audience member asks a question   mm hmm  audience member continues   pardon  audience member continues   oh okay  yeah   audience member continues   that's very difficult   what did you do  audience member continues   right   audience member continues   mm hmm   audience member laughs   audience member continues   it's a very difficult problem hyperactive kids  audience member continues   sure  audience member comments   yes  audience member continues   that's right   audience member continues   yeah   audience member continues   right   audience member continues   that's right   audience member comments   mm hmm   audience member comments   mm hmm  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   mm   audience member continues   definitely   audience member continues   definitely   audience member continues   yeah   audience member comments   i think that's a good point   like every time you have a discipline problem ask yourself why   why did you have that problem   that's what i usually cos whenever i have a problem a discipline problem it goes back to that idea of any group of kids can certainly become problem  and it's usually has to do with the way you you   you presented your activity  it usually has w the activity itself  you know always question the activity that you're working with  you know  but what i'm what i that's that's a part of class management  and uhm but what i what i'm trying  to to say is that you will always have discipline problems  and you have to deal with the discipline problems  this this this uhm student that you have okay a student who is hyperactive  you're gonna going to have to deal with that student for the rest of the year  so you're gonna going to have to find ways to deal with that student   you're gonna going to have to you know  you have no choice   the thing that that that that that that  is a a big problem today in teaching in my  opinion is that a lot of teachers think they have a choice  and that choice is to do nothing but that's not a choice cos you're just  gonna going to have more discipline problems  you're gonna going to have  many many many more discipline problems than if you s take it  head-on and you think about it you know  and you try to find solutions  i think discipline problems the worst discipline problems  turn into solutions   the kids that you'll have the problems with could become your best students after   you know these things will happen  when i'm tea you know that it sounds  ah you know like that kid isn't i the  wor worst the ones who  who cause you the most problems could be your best most interesting students you know   could be the most dynamic could be the funniest you know  could be the most creative   but they're they're wasting their time in school  and they give up   they've given up in school a lot of them you know  like they find it boring and stupid  did you something you'd like to say   audience member comments   yeah  audience member comments   okay  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   laugh   audience member comments   oh god  audience member comments   uh huh   audience member comments   sure  audience member comments   yeah sure  audience member comments   yeah  audience member comments   yeah eh  audience member comments   yeah eh   but it's amazing how they can uh   if you can t   cos the energy is there right   the energy uh  i think one of the big things  you know i don't know how much we have  about ten minutes left eh  audience member replies   yeah laugh   okay  but the laugh audience laughter   audience member comments   yeah laugh audience laughter    audience member comments   audience member comments   okay yeah   sure   audience member laughs   but the uh i think one of the the the   that's a good point   and that's a good point too laugh  audience members laugh   i can see all of your points   and the idea is that you have   one of the things you'll notice when you walk in the classes  is each class has its energy you know  and a a class can have a negative energy like a class can have a positive energy  and what you what class management has to deal with in in uh in uh in uh teaching what class management has to do is how you're going to control  or manipulate that energy to k make it into a positive energy  a learning energy   your goal is always learning  so you have to think of ways to do that okay  and that has a lot to do with motivation okay  how you're going to motivate your students   and what i'm trying to tell you is you have your first part which is very traditional teaching and then you have to start  learning how to motivate your students and to make your class more interesting  cos the traditional will not work that long right  you know what i mean  li like you you   you   you know how long you do vocabulary you know what i mean before they catch on laugh audience members laugh   word   it's true laugh   so you have to you have to start  you know getting more and more  and it's a kind of a tricky  and i'll tell you this is the this is  when you're gonna going to be more insecure  because you'll have the students okay like uh you have them   in your in their s places and you're doing vocabulary you're walking around and you're going okay what's this word and you know you're kind of arr arr arr funny noise you know you got your   and then word you're not  gonna going to start making them do group work  and cooperative learning and and then you start getting scared  cos it's insecure right  it's an insecurity cos you're gonna going to let it you're gonna going to  let your whole structure grow into a new one and you have to know how to do that transition
