 but did you see mr grey-tootoo blending any chemicals at redside   no sir  did you see him using the blender  no but i've seen one of his workers uh from time to time doing something for the chocolate side   for the  okay  so at that point in time did you realize then according to your evidence that percy grey-tootoo did not manufacture chemicals  well i hoped  i didn't know  i hoped he did  he was trying to hire me  is it just looking back that you now know that  is that what you're saying   no no  i believed he was manufacturing at that time  did you believe it at that time  yes i did  okay so before you left redside for macaroon  you believe that mr grey-tootoo did manufacture chemicals  yes sir  and now you're saying he didn't  is that what you're saying   no sir   i didn't know  i don't know  i'm saying i don't know sir  okay  so he may well have been manufacturing   he may well have been sir  okay  thank you for that  and uhm uh did the technology is that is it   percy grey-tootoo is that what redtag chemicals wanted  was his ability  yes sir  not yours  no sir  you didn't have any  no sir  all right  since then have you any  uhm i've adapted more knowledge now  let's put it that way  ya but you've had no formal knowledge in in  this area   no but i it  doesn't take much to formulate a product sir  it's all given to you   okay  so you do formulate prducts now   oh yes sir  okay  so you do have some expertise at this time  yes sir  all right  so when you came to macaroon with percy grey-tootoo  it was to set up a chemical manufacturer or distribution system for  redtag   yes sir  all right  and who made the arrangements as to the location  uhm percy grey-tootoo and hal ferrier   did you involve yourself with that part of it  no sir  i was going along having a look what they were deciding   they were located in the nova building redline  chemicals was word sir  mhh hmm  and uh and so far as the arrangements made with the integration space uh did you play any part in that  no sir  uhm were you at any time expected to be any part of the manufacture of uh of any of the chemicals or any of the uhh materials that were going to be sold  well  was that part of your job  uhm my job description in the beginning was uh marketing sales manager  yes  so you weren't at the beginning to be involved in any of the manufacturing  no sir  all right  and you knew nothing about it  no sir  isn't that right  that's right sir  no sir  okay  so that it was your understanding that mr grey-tootoo  would be the one in charge of that aspect of the operation  yes sir  all right  and when you came to macaroon and started operations was he in charge of that aspect of it  when he could be  yes  was he  yes sir  you didn't manufacture any chemicals in macaroon   oh yes i did sir  did you  yes sir  okay  when did you start manufacturing word   uh when he was incoherent and couldn't and he wanted me to blend some product for him and he didn't have uh people in production  all right  so you say that if  twenty-four word   you say that when he was incoherent which you're suggesting is that he would be drunk   yes sir  okay  and so when he was drunk you had no choice but to take over  uhh  is that what you're saying  no sir  what are you saying   he directed what to go in the tanks  all we need to know all we needed to know   is what  he instructed us what to put in there and we'd put it in there  so he did uh give some instructions about manufacture  oh ya  yes sir   we wouldn't uh be putting our own  we we don't know the formulas that he's supposed to have had or the ingredients that he's supposed to have had  we wouldn't know that  okay  so what you're telling me then is if i understand correctly is that he would give you the instruction as to what to put in to the batch maker to make a batch of chemicals   because without that you couldn't do it  yup  yes sir   yes   no sir  so that you agree with me that there was the manufacture of chemicals at the plant  yes sir  all right  and what chemicals were manufactured at the plant  a chemical that was already produced for mainland oilfield supply which was called drill splash which did not  work  okay   well i i i at the moment i didn't ask you about whether it worked or not  i asked you what chemicals were produced  you're asking me   i understand  what you're asking me is which word   all right  i need you to answer that  ya  drill splash   what   drill splash   drill splash   'kay okay   and that's what it's called  yes sir  all right  so that's one of the one of the   chemicals hat were manufactured  revex would be   yes and revex would be another sir  and that's the next thing i was going to ask you  revex   ya that would be in small quantities  and what was that for  uh same as drill splash but it's  uhm drill splash is half the strength of revex    half the strength  so it's a different formulation than drill splash   well you put more water in revex i suppose and then you have drill splash   ya  so it was a different formulation  yes sir  right  and did you on his instructions make that too  yes sir  so those are two chemical formulations that were made at the plant that you're aware of  yes sir   yes sir  and you when you got the formula from mr  grey-tootoo would he give it to you in writing  uh no sir  he'd uhm he'd stipulate what to put in there  in other words so it wasn't written down  no  well   no not really  all right  and so even when he was you say incoherent he was able to give you those instructions  well if the you know if the  formula doesn't turn out right and he gives the instructions   i mean it's his formula  he should know what he's he's saying so yes we did formulate under his instructions  all right  so  so just to back him up a little bit  you indicated that you used to do this mixing when he was incoherent  is that so  sir you have to understand that seventy-five percent of the time he was incoherent yes  all right  so the so your answer is that when he was incoherent you would have to do the mixing  well or the production people yes sir  okay   but even though he was incoherent he would be able to give you the formula to mix   i would like to know it was the right formula sir  i had to operate by his instructions  so the answer is that he was able to  yes   i hope so yes  yes and and you were able to comprehend what he gave you  it was trying at times  ya but you did you did comprehend  it and you did make the mixture  yes sir   yes sir  all right  and that's the product that was subsequently sold  did you sell drill splash for as  the sales manager   it was ruled   it was reworked and sold back to the people that it was supposed to have been sold to in the beginning yes sir  okay  did you as the sales manager sell this drill splash   no sir   did you arrange for the sales of the drill splash   no sir  who sold it  mr grey-tootoo made arrangements with the  mainland   okay  so mr grey-tootoo himself sold it  i'm sure he did  all right  and so what about the revex   that was just sort of stock that didn't go anywhere  'kay okay   none of it was sold in other words  well it's a good bit of chemicals  i'm not too sure of the quantities sir  'kay okay   did you arrange for the sale of any of it  uhm no  he woud do that himself  all right  so he sold that as well  yes sir  okay  now in addition to those to products did you see any other products manufactured at the chemical plant in macaroon in the time you worked there whether it be as redline> cryozine or  revothine   uh revothine they may have done some uhm  electr electric uh word electric  six hundred that they call word electric six hundred word   so the answer is   oh excuse me sir   excuse me  all right  i'll back up  certainly  the products  i went to korea of course  they were blended there and i would have seen that   ap application uh s g twenties and  greases and word   okay so there were other products manufactured in addition to drill splash and revex   and what let's let's   state one other  what was one other that was made   oh let's okay let's  go for fadi   let's call it fadi   what do you call it  fadi f d i f a d i    and and were you involved in the mixing and manufacture of fadi   yes sir  and uh did you uh did you uh  instruct as to how that was to be mixed  no sir  i was instructed by mr grey-tootoo   oh  so mr grey-tootoo told you the formulation that was necessary to manufacture fadi   he just told us what had to go into it  we put it in there  yes  what do you mean just   do you know how to make fadi today  uhm yes sir  you now know  yes sir  how would it be  is that because of formulations you took from him  no sir  i got it from uh shakco and impress and uhm other companies that he's gotten his formulas from  okay  so you make fadi now  one six five  this is our combination is five hundred  five uh  there's different combinations word   and do you show on your product that it's manufactured here  uh yes sir  uhm no i don't think we do sir  but you make the product   but we make the product here  it's you know  you do not show word   we're far far away - based   do you show as manufactured in far far away   yes sir   lots of it we do  yes sir  well is is manufactured in far far away   yes sir  including the fadi   yes sir  we buy the base product bring it here and manufacture it  all right  so that's  no problem  so the fadi was being manufactured at  redline chemicals cryozine and revothine   is that right  uh there's only one time it was formulated which was for  redline and that went over with uhm to  korea  ya   and instructions given by percy grey- tootoo  for the mixture  yes sir   yes sir  and are you using the identical mixture he used then  no sir   do you remember what he used  laugh i haven't got a  can't remember  i know it doesn't work  well i didn't ask you that  okay  you're anxious to say that stuff aren't you   well it's sitting in korea sir and i was just  there   all right   i asked you not if it worked or not   okay  mhh hmm  did i manufacture it  yes sir  i helped manufacture it yes   yes   okay  on his instructions  on his instructions  and was he incoherent when he instructed you on that   mhh i couldn't say sir  all right   general yes  generally yes  mhh hmm  okay   cos you said already okay he was drunk seventy-five percent of the time   and time after four o'clock  yes sir  okay  and you manufactured this stuff after four  we acted at four til until  one or two o'clock in the morning  all right  okay  so you've got now three products that were made under  percy grey-tootoo 's instructions and manufactured under his instructions  are there any others other than the fadi
