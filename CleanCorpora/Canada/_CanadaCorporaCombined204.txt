 you're right we   in a sense everyone's a teacher right  in a sense everybody teaches something and that way why did you become a teacher  because you enjoy that and it's something that you want to do you want to share  and that's good you know   that's a good thing  but we sometimes we confuse you know  the uh the idealistic point of view of teaching compared to the down to earth   uh you have a teaching position teaching okay  and in my there's there's a bit of truth in both but it's it's a very different thing   and when you start teaching and you sign your contract  okay you're dealing with a contract you're dealing with a job  you're dealing with uh responsibilities  you're dealing with many many responsibilities in what  you have to deal with  and in my opinion it's my word you're dealing with a workload okay if you consider everything which is virtually physically impossible as a first year student teacher   if you take everything into consideration  you don't walk into a teaching position snaps fingers a teacher   you know you don't walk in knowing how to deal with discipline right away snaps fingers   you don't walk in knowing how to deal you know with supervising  you don't walk in snaps fingers knowing how to deal with the meetings with parents  you don't deal snaps fingers know how to deal with the union  you don't know how to deal with uh uh the direction with principals  you don't know how to deal with the other teachers   you don't know how to deal with this with the students  you don't know how to deal yet with the uh psychologist how to deal with the nurse how to deal with the w social worker   you don't know how how to deal with the secretary which is an uh artform in itself laugh audience laughs  you don't know how to deal with evaluation adding in  all your your all your marks into the  the computer to make sure you understand the computer  you don't know all the rules of the school   you don't know all the rules of the union okay which is a very complicated document  you don't know all the rules dealing with what are your rights and what  these things take an awful long time to learn   compared to just walking into a classroom you know  to just walk into a classroom and have you know thirty kids in front of you and know what to do for an hour or you know how to deal with it   so i think what it comes down to what i what my  point is is that okay you signed a contract you're after the job interview you have all this work you wanna  want to gotta got to deal with uhm  you have to think of what are your priorities   okay  so when you start teaching as a full-time teacher okay e s l teacher in a high school what would be your priorities  what would be your first priority   audience member responds   get to know the students   okay  what would be yours  different audience member responds   behaviour problems  same audience member responds   to know how to handle behaviour problems  same audience member responds   okay that would be your number one priority or two  same audience member responds     sentence with students  i think it comes down to that  knowing the students  sure elementary school  what would be yours  different audience member responds   how to teach   okay what are you gonna going to   be what is gonna going to be your teaching strategy   same audience member responds   good  same audience member responds   okay  and what would be your yours word   different audience member responds   mm hmm  same audience member responds   heh right  same audience member responds   sure  same audience member responds   mm hmm  same audience member responds   do you mean kinda kind of like the levels  according to their level or  previous audience member responds     same audience member responds     word   how do you imagine your first day of teaching  how do you imagine what do you think it's  gonna going to be like   if you had one word to describe what the first day of teaching is gonna going to be like what do you think it would be like  different audience member responds   nerve-wracking okay  different audience member responds   three words laugh audience laughs   but really what would be yours uh  previous audience member responds   your for your first day of teaching word   what would be your first way of describing first  what would be the first word   same audience member responds   mm hmm  same audience member responds   yeah but how do you how do you as a per   how do you feel towards it  what is your what would feeling about it  if i say how do you feel about your first day of teaching  what w what word would you say would describe it  same audience member responds   very nervous  okay nervous  you are extremely nervous  and do you think you're gonna going to  have all your material  different audience member responds   there's big chances you're gonna going to  walk into the classroom with your kids with nothing  it's nice to say that your first day of teaching's teaching  but you m have to give this as your first thing  they probably will not have their material  and this could go on for a week  okay  they might not bring any paper  they may not bring any pencils  this is very possible   i'm just giving you a kind of the scenario  so audience mumbles   you have no   you have to kind of give yourself a worst case scenario   because what you want my my uh my broth my  one of my brothers is the president of a company okay  and he has one sign in front of his desk and it says no suprises  audience laughs   and that's sort of what you have to think of  you want no surprises  there will be  for example you might have a list of students fifteen students  ha ha i'm laughing  fifteen students  they made a little mistake you actually have thirty kids  they just forgot to put that other section on your sheet  audience laughs   you know i'm really sorry  well they might not say they're sorry but anyways audience laughs   you know let's let's you know deal with it  so these things may happen   so i'm gonna going to tell you  what to do for your first day of teaching  take it or leave it okay  what what i would do for my first day of teaching  first of all okay you want to think of an activity  that will involve all the students okay  and that will not threaten the students that has the least amount of interaction as possible  and that will not have anything to do with levels  weak strong  cos you don't know what they are now  they could be a strong group they could be a weak group  you don't know what you're walking into  all you have are names okay  that's all you have  so i'm gonna going to show you the activity that i do  i'm gonna going to do a little game  i'm gonna going to imagine that  i'm it's my first day of teaching and i'm  gonna going to show you the activity that i do  okay  so we're gonna going to imagine that there's laugh starts thirty kids here audience laughs okay  laugh ends   let's imagine there's thirty kids here sounds of setting something up   okay  they walk in   now first of all there's the way you walk in okay   now i'm gonna going to show you  what what i believe is is is  the bad bad way to walk in okay  someone tries to finish speaker a's sentence     replies   hi  hi  hi audience laughter   the word of the year is hi     two words audience laughter     alright guys  first day at school huh laugh   okay   okay let's audience laughter more setting up noises for about 10 sec   it's okay  you don't want us to hurt your back okay   okay you start first of all you  look at everybody word   the first thing when you walk into the class you look at everybody  and you just look at them for a second  and they're gonna going to be looking at you okay  that's the first thing to do  because you're curious about them and they're curious about you  so you look at them   and then write down sound of writing on blackboard  kay okay my name is  mister scott   now they won't say a word   usually they won't say a word sound of writing on blackboard for thirty seconds   i want you to sit okay sit sit okay sit down sit in alphabetical a b c d alphabetical order   for example my name is scott s   i want you to get up and sit in alphabetical order  and then you sit down and you watch them   now they'll start looking around   and right away you're gonna going to  see certain students who understand   so right away you're gonna going to  start picking out your students who are quite strong okay who understand  and then you're gonna going to find your leaders okay  the students who're gonna going to go okay you you sit down you're there   they may speak in french okay  if you wanted to you could really work out the language and make them speak in english  okay if you wanted to you can say sit before me  in the class if you want to okay  but i'm talking about just your crash course okay   so you're gonna going to find out who your leaders are  you just sit down and you just watch them okay  and then when they're sitting down in alphabetical order  first you've accomplished your first activity okay you have them sitting in orer order then you sit down and you take a piece of paper which has little boxes on it and you ask them each their name and this is their seating plan  this is where they're going to sit   audience member asks a question   by their last name     yeah  audience member asks a question   high school   i'd say primary school too you know  i would see it  but this is definitely high school which i used it in you know  and uh  audience member makes a comment   yeah what it is that's cooperative learning right  it's a it's c it came out of cooperative learning when i thought of that idea   and it's it's a lot you know  you cos you see them sharing and trying to you know  work out and you'd find out who your leaders are and you'll find out who's a bit stronger   you'll find out who's a bit confused   and there also and and it's you know what i like  about this activity is there's no confrontation   there's no oh well we're gonna going to  make a seating plan  oh no feigned student voice whining in mixture of nonsense mumbling and quebecois french some audience giggle   and there's no word   okay well what's your name uh  imitates student replying in quebecois french   no i mean there's none of this kind of stuff there's no interplaying   ah then there's uhm there's the  idea of them doing a the the work  they're doing all the work   and then you just sit down and you have it in a place and a face and you know you know where they are  that that accomplishes something  and then then what do you do  now you're still in we're still in our first class right   okay we're still in our first class together   you don't have any material okay we're still in that thing where you don't have any material  so what do you bring  you make sure you bring paper with you   you know if they don't have a pencil then that means they're pushing it  you know maybe audience giggles you know maybe you should bring pen i dunno don't know   it depends on your situation you know  but i didn't have to bring pencils at least but i did have to bring paper you know  so they go imitates student moan   go ah ha you know audience giggles   take out the paper and what do you do for the first class  what would you do as a first class activity   audience member responds   okay what did you do for your summer  same audience member responds some laughter  that's good   audience member responds   write about yourself   good  audience member responds   what would you do some laughter   audience member responds   okay  audience member responds   mm hmm  oh for them to get to know each other  okay   same audience member responds   audience member responds   sure  same audience member responds   good  same audience member responds   that's good  it's a very interesting activity  i think it's a very interesting thing   okay that that that's good     okay now uhm  i'll tell you what i would do okay  same audience member responds   no it's okay  like i like that because it's it's a i think it's a really good idea and maybe i'll try it you know   but uhm what i do laugh starts okay comes down to  laugh ends this writing on blackboard for 5 seconds   we'll do vocabulary okay  why   because your students just came back from the summer okay  even if they're from even if i'm teaching   secondary five you know i've taught secondary five as well   but they just came back from summer   most of them forget all that they learned okay  and and and you know they  they need vocabu   and vocabulary is very very traditional okay  what the students   this is this is an important point   you okay because of of university  you have you have forgotten the rules of education in the sense in the formal rules of education   a student knows much more than you do because they're there in class  they know the rules of the game okay  they know that they sposed supposed   to bring their schoolwork okay  they know that in class we write down on paper   they know that in class do i write with a pencil or do i write with pen okay  they know these things   they know uh vocabulary they've heard that before  you know we're gonna going to do vocabulary   we're gonna going to look at english words and you're gonna going to you know  study these words  they understand that   audience member makes a comment   sure   they they know the word  vocabulaire   they understand okay this is the word and i have to study this word   they know these things   they know placement   they know a seating plan   they know they've had that before okay   so i do vocabulary because it's something that they know   and you want to start with something they know   you want to gain their trust okay  cos when you have the trust of your students then you can have a great time   then you can start doing very interesting activities  you can start   but if they don't trust you they're not gonna   going to do that much for you you know as a teacher  cos they wanna want to know if you're a good teacher or are you a bad teacher   because they have to deal with you   you know they know good teachers they know bad teachers  they know with this teacher they can do whatever they want  they know with that teacher they can't  they wanna want to know what they're  gonna going to do with you okay
