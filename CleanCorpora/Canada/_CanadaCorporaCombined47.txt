 uhm you know they drove around for about two weeks or so  ya but then your first experience of it will be in a city where you rent the car  your most likely place to have a problem is when you start and where you start is heavy traffic   hmm but i don't know where they're  i don't know where they're located uhm where the house is like in edinburgh </}   if it's right downtown or or you know  so does it mean that then they won't need the car if they  when they stay in the city  you know will they be  well they probably won't use the car anyway unless they're far  they'll probably use public transportation if it's  but the car's the same problem  once you've rented it it's costing you money and  you feel you have to use it  well ya you want to use it   ya  it's a vicious circle you know  ya well i don't know what they're doing with the car  maybe they're just renting it for uhm maybe they're just renting it for a week   how long are they going to be then  two weeks  two weeks   hmm   cough ya so they're leaving friday morning  they're leaving friday morning from here i think and they're driving down to toronto with uh you know those uh allo stop  carpooling service uh things  mhh hmm   and i think they're sleeping in in  uhm toronto friday night  cos i think they only leave they only leave   saturday  they'll be spending enough you know  mhh hmm ya  and that she was telling me that uh riverside  uh have uhm uh the the the head the head of the department  was sorta sort of like tried to make her feel guilty because there's a workshop on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of august or something that that that  you know that he said is compulsory  you know that all teachers should be that all teachers should attend this workshop  and you know she just said she couldn't you know  ya  and he just sorta sort of tried to make her feel guilty laugh about it but cough   so i don't know i mean can we think about  what should we do  should we make it a definite that we'll   i i want to go camping before the end of the month you know  and and the longer we leave it  things will happen  ya okay   there'll be some reason  this reason will you know   ya ya ya i know you're right   you're right ya  i think we should do it this weekend because next what if on you know what if i say next weekend then i find i'm in a total panic because i have to do all this work the weekend before   classes start   you you're going to be in a panic anyways   you're going to be you know  cough   it wouldn't matter what you did you'll be in a panic you know so  yup that's true   ya okay good  so then we'll uh we'll call   we'll call the place and see if we can reserve uhm  reserve a place for friday saturday  mhh hmm  so at least this way we get   you know if we leave early friday we're there   you know if we leave like at seven or eight  could be there midday   hiccup   excuse me  ya we'll be there at midday so we have the whole rest of friday and  all of saturday and sunday  i mean we'll see how much time it takes us to get there  so there'll be no sense  there'll be no sense putting this stuff away  and sunday   you know i'll just leave it downstairs  now that was your uh that was all planned  wasn't it  yup  means we'll have to go through all that again laugh  and hang out the hang out the  sleeping bags and laugh dry everything out and  well that will give me something to do while you're at school   ya  and we could make more of an attempt to get things ready foodwise  yup yup   you know   ya sure you know we could make something  something like uhm i don't know  if we make some chuli   can you freeze it  sure ya we've frozen chuli   remember we've we've done it  we've made batches of chuli and put it in yogourt containers and fr and frozen   it  mhh hmm   it because it's always   well it's it's especially if you're camping   you know i mean to have something hot at night a meal that you've actually cooked or warmed up you know i  it makes you feel much more   uh well i mean sandwiches don't interest me much you know  ya i know  i know that sandwiches don't interest you much period   uhm ya sure ya  and then if you know i mean ya we can have  planned sort of food and meals  and and ya as much as possible uhm you know we could just sort of have to if we just heat up   you know like if one night we have chuli   mhh hmm  i mean do you care one we could take my car if you wanted   do you care one way or the other  mhh uhh  no we can take my car  it's not a problem  okay   you gotta have got to learn how to drive a standard this  ya right  why don't we make that also a uh   and then i don't have to get up every morning  ya ya i think we should  no but seriously we should make it make a  point before the end of the month that i learn how to drive standard  just words   at least to be able to back out  mhh hmm  smash into the other car  right   i mean with the with the company downstairs there with the company i mean that will just sit and wait  right  we'll we'll leave that be until   early september   well i say until   no i say until sort of like that until the seventeenth   when i get my schedule and i know when i'm  you know when i'm teaching and when my office hours are and you know sort of figure out see when my free time is  but that's still summer  isn't it wasted time aren't  isn't it wasted effort contacting companies  no  all i'm saying is that i've got you know  that that's when i won't be ready   you'll have some spare time   ya i won't be ready to call people before then  you know   mhh   and then so that means  sorta sort of like the last two weeks of august  the week of the twenty-first and the week of the twenty-eighth  you don't think i'm thinking that  uh trying again whatsoever in summer i e before the end of august  is wasted effort  that it nothing really will have changed  people will either still be on holiday or they'll be just back and  you know   ya but i mean a lot of people said that it's in september you know beg beginning   l late oct  october late august beginning of september that they'd be ready to make those kinds of decisions  i could look  i mean i've i've kept stuff on file  you know people that i have talked to and what they said  ya   you know cos in a sense i mean if we only get sort of like one or two contracts you know at least get our laugh   get back some of the money that we've put in you know   and sort of stay even   anything at all   okay for this   for this we   for this we can't  something else i mean we haven't been doing a lot of cooking here you know  no  uhm do you wanna want to  plan could we plan something   you know major meals each weekend  each weekend  each night  uh major proportions so that we can just take something of each meal and uh freeze it right right there you know  ya ya  i think it's a good idea  ya i know we we sorta  sort of lost the habit of doing that  i mean cos we used to do that more often  like make big chunks of you know big pots of  of vegetable soup or that harira soup  remember that sort of that sorta sort of   that   sorta sort of hot soup   mhh   that'll be nice   that'll be nice camping   ya okay so there you go  for the next two days you've got a project laugh   you can make chuli and you can make hariras  except soups except soups  uh for camping i mean they take up a lot of volume and it's not a lot of food  they waste a lot of space for a for a  meal that's not very  well a yogourt container  i mean we're just it's just two  two nights we have to worry about  so   okay ya  no but i mean i'm just giving that as examples  we can there's other stuff that  we can make   chili's good   chili's good   ya chili's a good idea  uhm uhm quiches  oh you can't you can't  transport a quiche  i mean i i it's  it's a  word it's it's    why not   well ya what do you do  what are you gonna going to do   words   ya you can't put it in the fridge  you'd have to almost uhm  we can make a a a thing of pasta   you know pasta that my mom makes in the with the  penne in the oven that's with broccoli and  and uh   like lasagna sort of  ya but it it it's all  we can make we can make a bunch of that  and take you know take some of that camping  i mean that's sort of that's a nice meal  well what needs doing housewise as far as  are there any other projects that we haven't done yet around here that now or never  no i don't think so  i gather if i understood your dad was saying that some guy's gonna going to show up for the balcony  ya some ya that's why he was just telling me if if you know if you see the guy and he has some questions you can give him my number but  so   mhh hmm  okay  that stained glass is so nice when the   sh sun shines through it like that   mhh hmm   ya we should have janis over soon again   mhh hmm  ya  oi yoi yoi   well your parents won't be upset will they  what if we take off  ya again   no  i'm thinking i wonder if  i'm saying i wonder if we cou we could  you know get them to come with us and put them up in a motel somewhere but that's  that complicates things  that's that's   well it's sort of iffy because we don't know the area  we don't know where the hotels are   how far two words ya  ya the i mean the whole peninsula's a park isn't it   i think so  i think that's what it looked like  ya the whole tip  the whole tip   so they'd have to go they'd have to go back to the four oh one before they'd find something  ya ya  or otherwise even like the the that  sand banks area  i mean it wasn't very  remember we sorta sort of looked  we stopped in a couple places  i mean it wasn't it wasn't  very nice  mhh hmm   no  also i mean they're not gonna going to   get off at six in the morning you know  no   no they would  they would  i mean just recently when my uncle was over   when my uncle was here from italy and they went to ottawa there uh to quebec city that one day  remember and i went out drove out   to to sort of  cos i gave my uncle the gift i   i was sending to my aunt  mhh hmm   i mean they were sort of upset with me cos the   they were waiting  they were ready  oh ya okay
