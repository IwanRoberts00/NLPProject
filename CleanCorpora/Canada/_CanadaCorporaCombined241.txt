 raoul eto said he has no idea what happened at that coat check area and this is an area where someone punched him   someone actually punched him and he doesn't remember   charles says he went up to ask   he got hit in the head and he got escorted out   glen hawker said he went up to talk to mick   he got pushed up against the wall and punched but he can't say what happened next   and ron lister said he sees mick grab glen  but he is in a choke hold  despite this he still sees what happens to glen but he doesn't see anything else  he doesn't see what happened to raoul eto   colleen doesn't remember anything  mike didn't see anything   don craw didn't see anything   and dawn kramer and wanda wisha well they don't really word   they didn't get up maybe three words   what i suggest to you is what they saw is what i already explained  they did see something going on there with mister millner   mister avalon says he came out of the office albeit the skirmish was already well under way and he testifies to what he saw albeit he is not a hundred percent positive of who he saw word   because if you'll recall he couldn't say that mick millner  was down on the floor with raoul eto but mick by his own admission said that   and word you saw mister raoul eto a fairly large man   what i can't understand or what confuses me here is how  none of these people could see what was going on there right in front of them right there on the floor in the coat check area  all of these people charles glen ronald   word they can't word   after hearing what my client had to say i asked myself  a couple words if he was going to fabricate a story at this point in time he he knows what these other witnesses witnesses are saying  none of them can say he did anything  if he was going to fabricate a story why wouldn't he stay out of trouble if no one else was going to word   why wouldn't he say i didn't do it but he does  he does because he's not that two words   now my client readily admits that he punched mister  eto but he did not punch him word you'll recall his testimony until mister eto had started struggling  word   and the reason he punched mister eto is because mister  eto was trying to two words trying to injure him word   and my client was very animated   he said i punched him once quote continues  and i suggest to you that that's a few words   you know that the officer when he examined my client's hand with the word later that evening found a nick there  well that nick was from mister eto   that nick was from my client putting mister eto in a  word   now when mister eto left when he was escorted out he wasn't two or three words   and i suggest to you that that's the reason two words  my client hit him  my client only hit him three words   one of the other reasons why my client word   o one of the other reasons why the  initial altercation at the coat check three or four words  is because mister raoul eto before anything else was done reached up and grabbed my client by the collar and tore off his gold chain   he tore off the gold chain that my client was wearing and he left a mark on my client's neck  and i put his mother on the stand   she saw him the very next day  she said his mother testified that he had this mark  i tendered the gold chain as a an  exhibit and the reason i did that is because i want you people to go back to that jury room to have a look at that gold chain  look how thick that gold chain is  it's not a word   imagine what type of a force was necessary to yank that off of someone's neck   he yanked it off hard enough that it left two words  so what my client is saying about that being the  action that started the whole incident what do you think   raoul eto reached up grabbed him by the collar breaks his chain he put mister eto in a headlock  at that same time mister glen hawker came up to him by himself   and mister hawker said   word walks in and said maybe two words or just happened what's going on   mister millner came in said do you want a piece of it too and pushed him up against the wall and he punched him   well ladies and gentlemen let me ask you this first of all if indeed mister mick millner did say do you want a piece of it too why would he push him up against the wall and strike him  mister hawker has given no response to that  mister hawker hasn't come at my client according to mister hawker   so why would my client do that  my client is merely if indeed he did ask that is asking a question  he says do you want a piece of this too   i suggest to you that mister hawker must have done something he must have done something to my client to facilitate my client grabbing him and pushing him up against the wall   and do you know what he did i suggest to you i suggest  two words that he grabbed my client by the shoulder and he grabbed my client to get him to let go of his friend raoul eto   and it's at that point in time mister millner  three words   let me also put to you ladies and gentlemen he has mister raoul eto in one hand he has mister glen hawker up against the wall in the other hand and then he's supposed to pull back  and hit mister hawker   ladies and gentlemen that would to me seem to be very difficult  let me also point this out to you  mister hawker had a cut above his eye  that's all he had  no stitches   no black eye   no bruising   just a cut  and he couldn't get a hospital to treat him  about three words   that's word   that was it   i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that what indeed happened  to mister hawker was he grabbed my client by the shoulder  my client pushed him up against the wall   a few words because he didn't know at that point in time exactly what mister hawker was going to do  and then at that very same moment mister montebank  came crashing in and my client about three words   he let go of uh mister hawker up against the wall  and i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that whatever injury mister hawker suffered two words got cut he  suffered after my client let go of him   there isn't word any maybe four words   mister hawker any number of them could have cut him but my client was not one of them   my client denies three words   and i think ladies and gentlemen when you look at that  two words   bear in mind that when my client grabbed him he didn't have any intention to injure him  mick said i woul would  i pla pushed   him up against the wall   there is no indication in the testimony that mick millner  intended in any way shape or form to injure mister uh hawker    uhh how about granada avenue  let's go to that thing   there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever from any of the witnesses that mick millner had anything to do with raoul eto  out on granada avenue   the crown's witnesses say they they  didn't two words   out on granada avenue that skirmish that was going on back there mick millner was not a part of it   i spent a lot of time in cross examination going over the witnesses where mick actually was out on granada avenue   and only three witnesses agree maybe two words  only three of the crown witnesses agree two words  say what mick was doing and where he was   charles montebank said that he ran around  two words   someone threw him on the ground hit his head can't remember anything   okay   well that's consistent with what mister frank wasylesko  said  he said he grabbed charles threw him  threw him back and two words   we know mick's still not involved at this point in time   colleen paske said two guys were punching and kicking charles quote continues   ladies and gentlemen quite a few words going on word but what's going on with mister  raoul eto   they wouldn't do that   they quite a few words mister raoul eto    he was curled up on the ground   they didn't stop the rest of utterance   word ladies and gentlemen a few words   ron craw a strong word  you'll recall what he said  he said mick was on the other side of the street with charles quote continues   clearly strong evidence as to what happened on granada  avenue between mick and chalres   recall mister craw's very emotional outburst   i know those words are still in your mind   he said mick was not kicking  punching or hitting charles quote continues   that's what i copied down from what mister craw said   as you'll recall it word seem like the end of a like i said a an emotional outburst from mister craw   and that ladies and gentlemen is exactly what my client said he was doing  he said he went out onto granada avenue got there   he took mister uh charles montebank from frank wasylesko   colleen was holding onto him  pulled her away  he pulled charles away from colleen   turned him around and walked back into the bar  he didn't appear to be unconscious to mick  but you know he could have been dazed maybe three words   he even says that perhaps that he fell on the pavement  he didn't maybe three words   of course he was going to be somewhat dazed maybe somewhat unsure of himself or maybe somewhat unconscious   now the crown is going to suggest to you that my client must have done something out there because charles montebank was unconscious at this point in time and because charles montebank  doesn't remember anything that happened between that time and the time he came back to the back hallway but ask yourself these questions  if he was unconscious why would mick millner say to him come on you're under arrest   why would he talk to someone who's unconscious  that doesn't make sense cough   what about   about three words testimony that we know what happened out on ninety-third street  we know mister montebank ran away on ninety-third  street  ask yourself how can an unconscious man two words run away   sentence   i don't think mister montebank was unconscious  at the very most i'd say mister montebank was  rest of utterance   sentence   then not by my client mister mick millner   now remember too mister craw was fairly confident   that that mick or that that  charles montebank was unconscious but it was dark out there and mister craw just walked past uh mick  and charles and really didn't stick around he didn't   a few words made a comment   here's what i think   it's quite possible very possible that what he saw was mister  montebank rest of utterance   now how about this ninety-third street incident   charles can't remember it the very individual that ran away can't even remember  raoul didn't see it   don craw anne kramer wanda colleen  they didn't see them   some people did though  mike treadle he said charles ran away from the doorman but mike can't i d two words   charles trips word doorman caught him in ninety-third and bounced charles' head on the  pavement three or four times  and he identified mick millner as being that person  he says it was mick millner word  the guy that was working the front door   mike pleads with the doorman to watch his arm  mike pleads with fred   fred a few words   then you have mister ron lister saying two bouncers went to get charles quote continues   but standing beside mister ron lister was mister  michael hawker   sentence   and he was watching the same thing mister ron lister  says or was watching out there on ninety-third avenue  or ninety-third street ninth ave   avenue ninety-third street   can you recall what mister glen hawker said  he said mick went out onto ninety-ninth  grabbed charles and brought him back   that's all   there was no bouncing of the head on the pavement like a basketball no shaking anyone  sentence   fred avalon also saw what happenedthen  he says mick went out and got charles   did he see mick do anything to charles   he remembers mike freaking out  that's what he remembers  why was he so upset   he's upset because his friends got kicked out of the bar because his friends are causing problems and even now mick has brought them back into the bar to face the music   now who's telling the truth here  well let's look at the medical evidence of mister  uh mister uh charles montebank   we don't have pictures like we have pictures of  raoul's head  all we have is what the doctor said  the doctor says that he noticed a bruising on either side of the head
