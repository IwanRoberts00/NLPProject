expressways  on the metropolitan otherwise things look uh good in both directions  d&eacute;carie southbound is working well and uh no problems so far in from the west island  thanks very much cam   in sports this morning well the big news is the canadian open tennis tournament  rusedski playing yesterday and uh this was the reaction of the crowd after he lost his singles match in the afternoon crowd jeering/taunting   well as laugh expected not a sympathetic crowd uh for greg rusedski although there were a few supporters out at jarry park yesterday  he had a doubles match later in the day which he won  marie macdonald was there uh throughout the whole day yesterday and she'll be in in about five minute's time with a complete report on what happened at jarry park uh with greg rusedski yesterday  should also mention uh that there was one upset  alexander volkov uh the sixteenth seed this tournament lost to arnaud boetsch uh six one six one  he was just uh cleaned out completely in that one  uh on tap today on centre court uh quite a few interesting matches to watch for  michael chang plays at eleven this morning if the weather uh doesn't prevent that against petr korda  uh one o'clock pete sampras uh makes his first appearance against jonathan stark  uh after that match stefan edberg and mats wilander will play  tonight uh another interesting slate of matches  uh at six thirty agassi plays his first match against jeff tarango  remember he was the guy that uh got suspended uh from play at wimbledon  and uh lareau plays against jim courier after that and then ivanisevic and all those other guys playing during the day today  so a lot of good tennis on tap today  uh the expos by the way ended up uh losing uh their game against the cubs yesterday in chicago  uh the uh score was six to five  the time now is sixteen minutes after seven music   expos did it again  they came from behind in los angeles last night  ninth inning they didn't have a run  they scored three and then held the dodgers and beat   em them three two  and they play there again tonight  colorado eliminated chicago blackhawks beating em   them in double overtime four to three  we go to the c j a d weather center and mister ted powel  it's warming up a little bit  a little bit  slowly  compared to yesterday  yeah   actually laugh   yeah you're getting there ted   not to bad a day actually  a bit breezy and at least we have some bright weather with us for the moment  the cloud is beginning to build though and it its the type of cloud that builds from instability uh george and that's exactly what we have uh moving in  just someting to kick off perhaps the odd rain shower  even an isolated thunder storm is not po possible  impossible a little later on this afternoon and into the early evening  that's because of a weak upper disturbance that will be ah moving across the area rather quickly late today  uh quickly in that it won't take long to clear right out behind it later on this evening and tonight  so a a very short lived weak disturbance moving through and that could give us a widely scattered rain showers even an isolated thunder shower  otherwise temperatures up into the mid teens this afternoon  uh generally in the fourteen to seventeen range for our highs  and we'll have those south westerly winds uh remain in the twenty to fourty range right through the afternoon  they'll begin to die down this evening  overnight uh under those clearing skies dropping off to between one and six degrees for our lows  tomorrow we'll have the sunshine with us again  almost a carbon copy of what we have today george except for the precipitation which will hold off until thursday morning by the looks of it  but we will see some morning sunshine give way to an increase in cloud during the afternoon  uh warming up to about fifteen to eighteen for a high  back to normal values  and again those southwest winds will shift around to the southeast in the afternoon  picking up to about fifteen to thirty  thursday is the most unsettled day of the week by the looks of it  lots of cloud around  uh summer showers or rain and uh hughs again of around seventeen degrees  but by friday we're back to the sunshine as high pressure begins to build in for at least the beginning of the weekend  uh high on f friday of around nineteen degrees  saturday uh sunny to begin with but i think we'll see some cloud build in later in the afternoon maybe even some evening showers  with a high of around twenty degrees   quarter after twelve and this would be mindy wyman  with uh skywatch traffic  all kind of calls coming in about uh police watching you with their radar guns  uh particularly out around the west island area  make sure you're driving that
