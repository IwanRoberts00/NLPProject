 good afternoon and welcome to free-for-all weekend edition where the free-for-all gang looks at the news of the past week and makes some comments about it  the free-for-all gang being of course tim smith alan rinaldi eliza green and george fraser   and ah i guess uh uh in montreal one of the big things that came out this week although it was early in the week and by now it's kind of uh a bit in the past but we had a couple polls that came out early in the week  interesting in both cases  one case ehm anglos anglophones  suggesting that they're outta out of here in many cases  although there could be a little exaggeration in that i suppose  and in the other case all ah montrealers including francophones allophones canadian meaning is 'someone whose first language is neither french nor english' and anglophones uh seemingly much more lenient about what kind of a city montreal should be ah compared to the people that uh govern us at all at all levels really  i don't think those polls exaggerate in fact they may understate because i've seen polls of young people which indicate a figure as high as seventy-five percent who who  plan to leave  and of course for a lot of older people they feel well there's too late to leave now or their jobs are here or they have a mortgage here but for younger people that constraint isn't there  that and and of course it's the leaving of the younger people in the long run that hurts more   mhhm oh ya for sure   well there ah ah number of things that come up from the polls  one about the sign issue policy re: signs' language  cough is that the politicians are woefully out of touch with what people really want or really care about  it's indicative that the p q parti quebecois, governing political party has been and continues to be obsessed not just with separation but with language and it is not an obsession with your garden variety quebecer  they have other things to worry about like eating for example  or working  laugh   that's more important  so i think that uh that the poll indicates that to a great extent  and the other thing about the other poll leaving  i don't think is an exaggeration  what what i do think it is is are people going to leave in terms of separation  ya i don't think i i've cough  met or heard too many people on the air who say that if quebec separate   they would they would leave but that doesn't mean they're leaving tomorrow or next week or even next year it means in the event   ya that's the part that i think is exaggeration in that poll  they they're talking about thirty percent who say they're leaving within five years no matter  i'm quite sure that five years ago we had a similar poll that said  thirty percent were leaving within five years no matter   we did as a matter of fact   ya ya   in nineteen ninety-one we had a poll that said  exactly the same thing  exactly   exactly   ya and it and it's easy to say to a ah pollster you know uh yes you're fed up and the pollster calls and says what's your view would you leave within a you bet i would leave  but a but a lot of people can't  i i think the erosion is already taking place  i think what we're seeing is a ah gradual slip-sliding away of   the english population the english-speaking population  and i think that'll continue  people aren't leaving in masses  they're leaving as soon as they can sell their house and  reasonably find another job somewhere else  i mean they're not le leaving  because they want to they're leaving because they can't picture a continuance of life as they've had here in the future  and that's why they're going  i ah there are a lot of houses for   sale that don't have signs in front of them  oh ya   ah a lot of people that i've talked to have quietly said  ya well our future isn't here we're just ah we're finding our way out of here   getting back to what alan was saying about the young people i mean there is a certain segment of the anglo   anglophone population who have no children here anymore  i mean there's a segment of the population where uh their children two or three of them not one of them lives in montreal  mhhm   the vast majority live in somewhere  else in north america  and there are other segments of the population where you know two out of three have left or one out of three have left or one is planning to go or once the kid is in graduate school or or  university somewhere well why come back  that's the erosion that's the hardest part of it  not just for the community but also alan  in your in your living make a living  as a as a professor kids will leave and if you don't have a base from which to choose from the locals ah you have to reach out more and that gets harder to fund and all the other stuff that goes with it  ya if you look at the english schools they've been cut more than half in last twenty years  well that that you know that catches up that hits the universities eventually  i remember being in on the radio about two years ago with some professors who were saying oh it's never going to happen they'll keep coming   i said where're they going to come from  well it's happening of course  mhhm   enrollments are dropping in the universities now  but they are dropping all over north america   they are dropping all over north america but we're going to get it worse because the base you draw from   have we gotten it worse   ya oh ya  have we gotten it worse is there a greater drop in enrollment in montreal  universities than elsewhere in north america i'm not sure of that   word   word we'll know better  we'll know better cos this just started uh last year and we'll know better when we see the figures for the coming year  i think el makes a good point about oldsters too   there there comes a point uh in  many elderly people in montreal they're sure enough they're kids aren't here  uh and when they get to a point when they need special care there's nobody here to care for them   so if if your son and your daughter and all of their family are now living in missisauga when it comes time to be looked after i guess you gotta got to go to   missisauga   but now there is a problem because they are the ones that are least capable of pulling up roots and leaving   ya i   that's the real th  there's the rub and that's why we have to ensure that the heal health and   soc social that's why we shouldn't flee we should fight because we have to ensure that those that can't flee are protected  well that's right tim but if it comes a point where you're going to go into the nursing home and your pensions are going to pay your way it might as well be a nursing home in colberg or missisauga  but you pen pension   i'm col correct me if i'm wrong but it's very difficult if you're on the b on the bottom line of this equation like if you're not living on much more than you canada and quebec pensions it's very hard to make the transition from one province to the other  oh no no your your  quebec pension   no your pension's your pension's your pension it's portable  you can take it wherever   no problem   i mean don't you have to go onto a waiting list in the other province  no it's a question of of room  not all the provinces publicly funded old peoples's homes  like we do in quebec   that's what i mean ya   well that's what i mean   that's what i mean   ya but your pension your quebec pension goes where you go   yes yes i understand that that's word  but you're just talking about the other places  i'm talking about   but it's also a question that if you're living on the bare edge of survival and you see you know and the extra cost just of moving to this location is a is a   major hurdle word   ya but again   ya   but we're talking about a couple of things one is is it better to be old in a home alone here versus   a a little more expensive place but near your children you know that that's the most important thing and the other thing is as children i i suppose we can talk about this at word we can't leave uh leave the responsibilities of our parents to somebody else  yup   th th  that's right  if you're an old person uh and you're going to be in a  a nursing home it's kind of nice that uh your kids and your grandchildren can come by on sunday and say hello  uh they can't do that if the kids are in missisauga  ya i just realized how uh defeatist we've become in  all of this  ya   see i i tend to think   well i have this fight with my wife i say   she says she's a francophone  i mean she says we gotta got to leave this province these people are gonna going to make our lives hell   ya   and i said no we can't leave  this is our life this is quebec this is where we live this is our home this is where we are going to stay  there is a future here     tim   in ten ten years in ten years where do you think your kids will be tru  truthfully truthfully   my ki kids well both of them want to live here in quebec  where do you think they'll be  i think they'll probably be here in quebec  my kids are kinda kind of weird like that  well   ya no but i   laugh   my daughter's more french than english and my son   is really happy in quebec   i but i've i've   thought that too tim and i have three daughters all of whom are are so  so bilingual as to be virtually bicultural but two of them are grown up and guess what one lives in vermont and one lives in ontario  it's the problem is it's not simply a matter of language legislation or quarrelling over legislation it's the fact that this quarrel obscures everything else that has to be   added and nothing else  gets done and i think ultimately what's the most disgusting part of it   ya   well th that's  that's why it gets defeatist because no matter what we do this envelops this overshadows this wraps us this is our life  ya   that's right and it's sometimes a little tough  this is free-for-all on c j a d   back to free-for-all with uh tim smith alan rinaldi eliza green and george fraser reviewing the week's news  i guess nationally uh the story which story do you think was made the news more ac  across this country doug young and uh mister n&utilde;nez or the dubai in halifax harbour  they both were pretty big national stories this week   uh uh definitely the dubai i mean that was the biggest story   i guess the dubai ya ya   ah because ah for a variety of reasons that it was something out of a movie that happened on the high seas and that canada got involved almost by accident because the boat happened to be here and the eight filipino sailors asked for refugee status because the r c m p wouldn't get involved and then they would because one arm of the government overruled another arm of the government because the romanian i mean was international intrigue  laugh ya   ya it was  you know and just to throw a curveball in there i wanna want to know why the russian spies story hasn't gotten more coverage  i like that one  well i think i think   well these are only  speakers a, b and d all speak at same time   well it got pretty good coverage it got pretty good coverage in the globe  ya i think it's cos they were only spy cadets as it turned out  they were in training   ya they laugh   and uh they had been fully infiltrated by c s i s  canadian security and intelligence service and c s i s was watching and reading their mail and basically seeing what speaker cut off but a   ya
