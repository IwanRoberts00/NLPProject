 but i like the idea of what i've been doing with the objects and just giving them a kinda kind of kitschy feel to them you know and stuff like that  like with the driftwood with this i think i'm gonna  going to do probably two more and then i  think i'll move on to the cheese or  mm hmm   cos i've been uh i've been like i was   just at a restaurant monday night i went to uh baum gartners and mal mala molio's or malvolio's   uh casa di pasta name of a restaurant, pronounced incorrectly  on crescent there   mm hmm   they just opened it up  but i just saw they they're trying to be so chic and this place and everything and  aside don't go the food is terrible laugh   laugh   but they had a really interesting thing  they took the rind pronounced like " rhine" or whatever of a big cheese like they gutted it out  and they just put all the parmesan in it  mm hmm   mm hmm oh that's word   so it was just this big giant thing of parmesan and this huge cheese thing and uh one of the girls i was with said oh you know you should use that as an idea you know like ooh cheese and cheese you know and stuff like that and i thought hmm yeah  so i've been tryin trying to come up with ideas for like making those cheese drawings you know   mm hmm   like putting some content into that just instead of just drawing like cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese  mm hmm   yeah i noticed there's a lecture coming up on uhm kitchen modernism and the relationship  mm hmm  it's just out on the uh on the  bulletin board out there  okay  and in uh the uh recent art in america magazine title  that i just got i thought you'd be interested in viola frey  okay   you must know viola frey's work  she does those huge ceramic figures uh with like they have little squares marked on them they're sort of divided up into fragments and they have sort of landscapes yeah and then scenes on them   oh i think i've yeah i think i've   seen some of her work   and she has uhm you know she does   these uh drawings on plates and i was thinking about you uhhhm  and i noticed that in her titles like she sort of gives some clue as to you know what she's thinking about in a particular image uhm  this one's called skeleton and horse and questioning woman  uhm   and then uh this one here you know red buddha   but the ceramic technique you know the painting on the plates   mm hmm   using the uh you know that  technique where the you know plate is very smooth and the the the  the medium is very liquid-like  mm hmm  word a lot of brush work and so the surface becomes very interesting   mm hmm   and very like it's very free and gestural and liquid so  that's the other thing i've been always like which you've pointed out with me is uh i've been tryin  trying to get more gestural in my work more expressionistic in a sense uh cos i think that's an aspect that loud noise in the background - maybe a stapler - twice i've sort of yeah kind of tightened myself up so much that i was always tryin  trying to be so perfect and conservative that now i think i'm enjoying more of the   well i was thinking of the values and the philosophy that's embodied in a look in the work  mm hmm   and so you know if i look at this kind of work you know it has uhm you know popular images art images like there's all kinds of sources  that appear in the work   right right mm hmm   and i guess that what i hear you saying is that you're looking for sources you know like memories other resources you know like right now   well i wen yeah but word   yeah  i do a lot of research too when i'm getting into stuff like this like the horror one i went through like horror movies and just flipping through images that i thought were kind of eerie and interesting and stuff like that  and i just uh i think it helps me a lot when i am coming to ideas because i always get stuck at certain points and then i just think oh it's you know go to the library and spend a couple hours goin going  through some books and you know something might click  and i was thinking that right now uhm as i've been looking at your work there's a formal issue that you're concerned with in the content  mm hmm   mm hmm  you know the sort of uhm word are evolving in the work  mm hmm   and i was looking at these and for example this one quite interested me  it's called monsters monster self looking in window uhm and the handprints you know that are incorporated and it's very speedy quick   yeah yeah  kind of an you know image  i'm not uh suggesting that you work that way or anything  yawning from speaker b in the background but i'm just uhm saying how   the pla techn the technique of painting on the plate   mm hmm  and the imagery usually one doesn't associate it   associate that with a decorative uh   the tradition of decorating plates   yeah completely right   that's a very uhm expressionistic look as well  as uhm s an awareness of uh notions of identity that come through in the images you know  so you know you get the uh   the handprints  the handprints on the side uh the notion of the idea that you know there's not just one self but of a monster self  mm hmm  you know that and the idea of the window you know the idea of painting being a kind of window that you look at the portrait and you know like actually drawing the window  yeah   so it's actually a very informed image in terms of you know the ideas behind it  hmm   like it may've happened intuitively in a flash  snaps fingers but it may have come out of uhm a certain awareness and uhm   again this one is uh called monster break-up chaos  and i just thought of you a lot because she uses these very you know sort of popular culture sources of things   yeah yeah yeah yeah i can see that  and it depends a lot on the intensity of the surface and the movement so she had to make it quite interesting   well she's very   i think it's very expressionistic  yeah  and very movement and   so when i look at the uh image of the owl okay uhm  what would make me think in your drawing that it's a memory   what clue visually have you given me to make me know it's a memory   and i would make that a a problem for you in your next work  right  like since these works are about evoking memory  right  uh how can you evoke like visually the idea that this is a memory  like how would i know it's not uhm you know uh something that you've seen that you reproduced  right right  do you know what i mean  okay  in other words how do i know it's a reference and not  something you're uhm   paying homage to in a sense  yeah that's it  okay okay  so it's difficult to uh get that sense of uh  what it's about  see that's right   you know and if i look at this guy's work here in this uhm artist uhm jacob lawrence  mm hmm  you know they're like pla paintings  that tell of the black exodus you know the migrations from the south to the north in the united states  and you know like the way he framed it okay the size each one's the same size  they're twelve by eighteen inches you know  mm hmm  so they have the size tells you like it's modest it's not supposed to knock you over  mm hmm  it's a very modest size  and then the text tells us  like one thing that you know it's not just a painting of buildings  right  is you know he informs us  uhm here it is uhm   reads some text aloud   mm hmm  so like the colours right away like they're not they're they're could be " there's" certain kind of colours  the painting has a certain illumination  mm hmm  it's simplified uhm it's modest in appearance  it's not it isn't given a look of slickness and uh it's given a certain look that's fixed in his philosophy  yeah   mm hmm  you know about uhm som there's something humble and touching about it  and then in an awkward like uhm very schematic look uh so that it's easily understood but also like it's very touching you know and it promotes certain values  so just through the look you get an idea of what the artist's values are  and that's what i'm questioning you  i think i'm yeah i can see what you're   it was uhm where   you know if i look at viola frey i get i get  an idea from the look of those marks  yeah   right  where she's at and the you know and her   values around artmaking  mm hmm  and i like found it interesting to look at these two artists because they're both aligning themselves with values visually  the values are being expressed in a visual way that are almost uhm anti-establishment this  yeah  just without actually saying it i mean in this case he's obviously you know accounting the history of the black exodus  mm hmm  but in the style like he's referring another aesthetic   you know   exactly   that comes from uh first of all the notion of story telling or telling the history of the didactic where like all this is very uhm contrary to  you know he's painting at the same time as jackson pollock i mean it was the antithesis of internationalist abstraction and so  and very consciously so  and yet he also uses you know sort of cartoon-like well not cartoon but very schematic kinds of images  and yet the compositions are very beautiful and really thought out uh you know like the choice of this yellow over here and just you know this very sombre unpretentious kind of mark is very important   and here as well oh here's one that says reads text aloud   so you know he's using this uhm  did these quotes come with the paintings then  yeah the quotes come with the paintings  so alright   uh they're placed next to them  but his compositions are really incredible you know like the little bits of colour and  yeah  the the you know you're in the presence of something that's the common people  mm hmm  and you get that not just cos the subject matter but through the way he lays paint down the way you know the uh flat cut-out approach you know he's aligning himself with a certain cultural identity and you know painting them in this way  the allocations and stuff like that yeah   so that's why i'm thinking about   since they're about memory and you're trying to recall certain nostalgia it sounds like what you're describing  mm hmm   now how could you start to uh communicate that aspect a bit more  yeah   perhaps uhm maybe you could disrupt some of the information you know like the words   right that's what i've been   yeah that's another thing i was thinking of doing  you know like letting things be fragmented a bit more because like memory one of the things that characterizes memory is that it's not exactly like something happening in the moment  yeah it's always blocks and pieces and trying to put it together  yeah and so formally like you've given me everything is in equal detail  so that doesn't make me feel very much like it's memory  yeah   mm hmm  uhm and there's nothing in the text to tell me that it's memory  mm hmm  i mean that's more factual than the text  so i think formally you know that's something to consider   well and in a sense in a sense like there is the nostalgia feel with like empty words like hypnovision and the mystic terror of the owl or whatever  well this   uh huh
