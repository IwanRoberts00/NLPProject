 we're a country that basically wants canadians to know that we all have a responsibility for our country and consequently for our actions  however as the minister of justice uh made clear legislation is only one part of the answer to violence among young people  protecting the public is the primary and necessary objective but we must focus our attention on helping our young people if we are to find lasting and effective solutions to youth crime  i'm encouraged to see that the amendments to the young offenders act include provisions for the rehabilitation and treatment of young offenders in the community  there are many complex questions surrounding yet  youth crime questions that the standing committee on  justi justice and legal affairs will be examining as part of the reform of the youth justice system  i will i welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues in the house to take action on the contributing factors to to crime and violence such as unemployment poverty alcoholism drug and substance abuse family violence racism and illiteracy  this is not to say that any of those one factors are justify uh justify any kind of violent crimes or should contribute to uh saying that young people have the right to commit crimes  that really isn't  these are mitigating factors  these are things that make it very difficult for young people to have a life that's well a life that's healthy and a life that keeps them from that side of uhm uhm the negative side of life so to speak  socioeconomic misery and crime are two sides of the same coin  by addressing these problems in our society we will be tackling  the root causes of youth crime and ultimately adult crime  it does not take any stretch of the imagination to see how such socioeconomic misery fuels anger frustration anti-social behaviour and criminal activity a young among young people   i would like the house to consider the adverse conditions  of many of our aborig that many of our aboriginal youth  face as they walk through the perilous path to adulthood  unemployment among aboriginal people is twice the canadian level  it is the number one problem facing aboriginal communities and they have the lowest incomes of anyone in the country  illiteracy rate among aboriginal people is twice the national average  high school dropout rates can be as high as ninety-five per cent in isolated northern communities  fifty-seven point seven per cent of aboriginal people are  under the age years under the age of twenty of twenty-four   the aboriginal population is very young growing fast and on the move  the majority of aboriginal peoples do not live on reserves and the migration of on-reserve aboriginal peoples to urban centres particularly in western canada is increasing  in manitoba it is estimated that one out of four new entrants into the job market will be of aboriginal origin  in saskatchewan it will be one out of three  are they destined for a life of unemployment social problems crime  the odds seem stacked against them but this not need be the case  five to six times the number of aboriginal peoples are incarcerated in provincial and federal institutions as compared to aboriginal peoples in the general population  yet aboriginal peoples only represent approximately three point seven per cent of the canadian population  the state of many aboriginal peoples in canada is not a pretty picture  despite these socioeconomic problems progress has been made in health education economic community development and social services  such progress is often linked to aboriginal peoples having culturally appropriate services controlled by aboriginal peoples  i'm proud to be a part of a government that recognizes the enormous potential that our young people offer have to offer   and that is prepared to invest in their abilities and to give them hope and opportunities for the future  this government has implemented a number of programs and services we feel that will help aboriginal youth and other youth as well recognize their strengths and grow to their full potential and to see the sun on the horizon in an optimistic uhm manner  i as secretary of state for training and youth along with the minister of human resources development we have announced a youth strategy  this strategy will attack some of the root causes for turning  youth into young offenders  in my riding uhm madam speaker last month uhm we made ah a contribution to ah a youth program with the gwich'in people  the gwich'in people have taken it upon themselves to build their own healing centre to deal with many of their social and justice issues many of their health issues  and they have done so ah along with the partnerships  they're that they're building with people who have the expertise from in and outside of their own communities  last month we announced thirty-seven projects as part of the first wave of youth service canada  we feel it's necessary to send a signal out there that young people can be contributing to their community and not taking away from their community with what many uh many attribute to young people as being very negative as only young offenders tend to get all of the stories and all of the ink and all of the news media covering them  there are many young people out there who are doing wonderful things who are not being celebrated and who are not being recognized  youth service canada aims to help eighteen to twenty-four  years year olds gain work experience develop their skills learn good work habits improve their self-esteem through community service projects  i wish you to know madam speaker that youth service canada should provide opportunities for youth to break away from the socioeconomic factors which have held them back and have seduced them into some life of uh uh some life in some who have uh basically become involved in a life of crime   just recently madam speaker it should be noted that i attended the university of calgary's graduation uh for their native students  they graduated eighteen native students with university  d university degrees some of them with a bachelor of social work some of them with a bachelor of education  there was a young girl there who or a young woman who uhm uh graduated with an engineering degree  those young people are very healthy models outstanding citizens who will help their communities and this country as well  so far madam speaker it's not all bad news  amongst these eighteen uh people that uhm that  graduated from the university of calgary they did so under the leadership of uh one mister rob carion who works with native students across this country who works on the uh calgary police commission and contributes in a number of ways  but it takes leadership and it takes caring  it takes generosity that uh that expressed   to these young peop young people to encourage them to let them know that the government cares that people in their community care that we in this house my hol  honourable colleagues and along with myself care about them and are directing our efforts to deal with those things  thus far madam speaker across canada from all the colleges and universities we have graduated ninety-two thousand aboriginal graduates from universities and colleges  that's quite a huge cadre of professionals who would contribute in some way to their community  on monday i was reading the newspaper from the ed   edmonton j journal  madam speaker and in there they featured also the graduation of native law students  there were about five or of them on the front of this  and i knew most of them uh but the one that sort of leaped out at me was uh none other than mister josh tanguay from the northwest territories an already twenty year veteran a native student a twenty year veteran of the r c m p royal canadian mounted police who's contributed to his community and to his country  he's a proud canadian who's worked hard for law and order in this country  he's a proud canadian who has worked for his young people in his community  he's a model for these young people  that is how it's done  success is the way in the native communities to bring further successes  so these ninety-two thousand people that have graduated thus far  along with these law students who were uhm uh on the uh front of the edmonton journal is the way to go  there's more than one way to deal with the whole issue of  uh of young offenders and the whole issue of social justice and and a number of other justice issues as well  there is rehabilitated but there's also the way of leadership young people who set an example as these people will do  madam speaker uhm a part of the consultations uh on the concept of youth ser service canada had me  in in contact with many youth across this country hundreds of groups that i met with  and i had the occasion to go to the stadium  uh we talk about all the bad things that are happening madam speaker  i went to uhm uhm ah a to the stadium in in toronto the skydome  there were fifty thousand young people at the skydome  these young people were there with their school boards and these fifty thousand young people were celebrating in a positive way what they call the journey of hope  and they were accompanied by their teachers  this was a positive uhm uh a positive  celebration to show that young people in this country are not just involved in crimes that they are doing many wonderful things  i had the occasion to be at many many uh graduations across the country many of which involved aboriginal youth but many which involve ordinary canadian citizens across this country  it's positive  it's it's wonderful to see people doing something constructive which they get no credit for  so i'd just like to celebrate that with you madam speaker and uh my honourable colleagues here  speaking about the uhm the youth service canada project i believe that every department every crown corporation will do its part to forge those ah partnerships that will produce healthier young people more well contributing young people across this country  in my language we have what's called dene tulu   dene tulu i speak a dene language and dene tulu is uh the path that you walk on  the path that you walk on madam speaker is the path of your own choosing  we've integrated that as one stream into the youth service corps because we need young people who have been marginalized who have been left out who have dropped out of the out of schools  they've dropped out of learning they've dropped out of the labour market and essentially they become so marginalized they drop out of life  we need to rebuild confidence  we have to get them back to work back to learning  and we have uh this stream called the dene tulu > which uh or which is called tulu which would have them contributing  it is uhm cough   whether the path that you choose is good or bad is really up to you  that's a dene form of justice  tulu is one of our four guiding themes for youth service canada project  tulu could directly assist those young offenders who are in community based rehabilitation programs  young offenders were also prominent at some of our consultations across canada along with the disabled and along with the s   the homeless youth  youth service canada is one part of the government's actions to help young people to make the transition from school to the workforce or to reintegrate into society  there are many attempts madam speaker that we could uh talk about that the government has put forward  we put forward a youth strategy  we have a youth internship program  on these uh very few days of the past we've been discussing the changes to the canada student loans program which will help young people to participate in a positive way in their learning for future jobs that they will engage in for building for i guess nation building ehm exercises in their community at the community level as well as in their region
