look unsafe  a union leader says quebec's automobile insurance board doesn't want the inspectors to show how many unsafe trucks are on the road  arnaud lebas says the board appears to be hiding the reality of what's going on  the insurance board has been criticized recently for lax enforcement standards  thirteen percent of trucks in quebec recently failed safety checks compared to thirty-two percent nationally   the union at the m i l-davie shipyard says a sixty-six million dollar government contract does not go far enough in meeting their demands  the province wants the company to build
