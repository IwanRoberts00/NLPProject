Canada	 word didn't get hiking boots  i guess that he has hiking boots but i think he just got them last year  uhm because david does say that hiking boots make an enormous difference not slide on anything  you're doing well of course most of your travelling is not done on the ground so it's not like your feet are going to ache because they're walking you know   on uneven terrain hours and hours on end   they were gonna going to   do have some very long portages   it's it's incredible that they're  even   i know   the size of the packs are uh you know almost bigger than you are  they're there from the top of your head to word  below your you know bum and uhm and then have to carry those canoes  amazing  how would you like to do it linda   i would  i would love to do that   i don't think i'd have the stamina   well well maybe if you're word    word   i couldn't do it for two weeks  i can't carry things  no no i don't know whether i could carry a canoe  i'd like to know i'd like to learn how to do that    but i uhm i guess with somebody else i could for a certain distance carry a canoe  right   it's not that uncomfortable once you get it up over your head  you can rest it on your shoulders  right  i don't know   i guess   could you see you and you and i doing it  oh no  you'd have to be have to be  word   you'd have to be all of equal height  ya  i think some of the trippers actually do a bit of the portaging by themselves they they bring it to the other end and they come back to help the kids with their packs   i see   but some of the portages can be an hour long   oh wow  mhhm word did seven days last year so she's got a taste of it  kenny did four and uh they can't relate  they totally can't relate  mhm  she's flying to new york today  she told me last night  it's passover so she and name are flying to new york today  mhhm  and then andy and i guess ian and the baby are flying i don't i don't know why i didn't hear the whole story   no   oh what to be with randy's family  her family for passover   oh okay okay    but the baby sat word   so but the kids they've been to new york a lot  it only takes them  are they jewish also  yes  so these kids regardless of what family they grew up in the second family or the first family they've always had jewish uh passover  right  it's not a new thing for them the   the american word   no   i was going to say you did a nice thing for them to be exposed  to yet another way to celebrate this season but they've  always done it that way  right  they've always done it because of ian's parents  ya  word told me last night oh i don't want to go alone  her sister doesn't count of course  phrase   she came and gave us all a big hug  we were all in the centre and she gave us all a hug  how word about it   ya but you know what riding her surrogate family  phrase in her life without even really thinking that you do that we are   phrase   she didn't phrase   and it was kind of oh bye   i know   i didn't see her quite catched word  on that one   quite sure   poor little word   aw certainly doesn't have it easy  no no  should be a little word when she grows up  i think she's got good coping skills i really do  ya   ya i really do and one of them is her sense of humour which is phenomenal  oh really  oh and a brat  she's a brat  but can get away with it this is nice  laugh   laugh   it's just a wee bit tired  laugh   laugh crashing noise on tape   i don't know what that's from  laugh   laugh uhm  i'll just put that over here  i'll have to take katy and go up to the general  phrase the only place to park but i'll just run in and drop her word   can you do can you drive that  word yourself  mhhm  that's not does that not bother you   have you ever done that before  mhm i've done it  no not really  now phrase that  phrase   oh i wrote that's amazing  of course i support it's it's no different really than uh dennis phrase    dennis phrase   i wish that i had thought of it  i would have brought the tubes home and done em   them in the morning and taken them to work  oh ya oh ya  i just operate like that you know  that ah  word suppose it's less intimidating for her to go in there with you and have you do it in a way  i'll just take it in to my clinic  yes  i could bring the the  bloods the deer home but then i have to take them back because i'm not going into work  anyway i think i word it  and she ah maybe she's highly sugges  suggestable   you know you know because i said to her i can not have any there's my word you know  oh yes  you know  but she has been tired  two weeks ago operation on a sore throat and she uh spent all day sunday in bed reading a book  well she can do that if she has a good book anyway  sounds like someone else i know  mhhm just like me  ya  when uhm but last night she came home and she played rugby and she was   ya  she never finished her homework she sat around for six to get up to finish her math and just   how's her appetite   it's not bad it's not you know she's a funny eater anyway  mhhm mhhm mhhm mhhm  no headaches  h terrible headaches  sore throat  well she had a h headache   sore throat two weeks ago   you know that i have a headache today and i have  word right  mhhm   but she complains of headaches a lot  oh well then and recently  mhhm  well  three weeks  oh well that might be then something then i would think   phrase   phrase   uh alison i don't remember  i i really couldn't tell you for sure way back in grade three whether she had headaches  you see a lot of adolescents   a lot of adolescents have headaches  yes they do yes they do   the sore throat thing though i was going to say maybe it's not mono mononucleosis because dennis has just got over a virus and so have all his patients where he was surprised at  the the the length of time that the sore throat uhm  hung on yes  mhhm   took to   and he this morning i said how are you and he said my throat is finally gone and he had it on  uhhh friday saturday sunday monday tuesday and wednesday  sore throat  sore throat  that's unusual for your regular  for your regular word   right   and i was about to say to him you know you've never had mono but i i feel so   did he he didn't have strep  streptococcus, throat infection   phrase   i don't know whether he ever   sw swabbed i don't know that he ever swabbed his own throat i don't know that but uh it's a little bit unusual so i was going to say if katy had a sore throat  which could alert you to mono if she has a lot of fatigue too  but it might be just this other virus but the fact that it's combined with headaches might   terrible headaches   and that's not usual for her   she gets headaches but they're more frequent now and she's got black circles under her eyes which i attribute to ah unhealthy eating habits  oh i see   yawn uh uhha  i wish she'd eat a steak someday but you know she  phrase   putting a piece of meat in her mouth she'll probably vomit  well of course that's what happens when when  ah initially you become a vegetarian just for a trend   uhm uh for trendy reasons then uhm  she uhm then they then they   lose the the taste for meat  phrase find it repulsive  uhha   it's been a few years yes  she can't even look at uh if we put meat  i can see that i i can see how you'd become that way  well i would too uhm  what's that shopping centre out in west island the big one  what about fairview  no the the   the third one oh uh   you know the one i mean   ya i do   you really need to word uh   phrase what's ah  what's ah   march&eacute; west  march&eacute; west  and we went there one day and we were going through the route the shops and we had pieces of meat that day  phrase   mhhm  i like to eat it but  i had rack of lamb up north  oh was it good  uhh it was wonderful  it was  ya  well i love it  i love lamb you know  who did you have it with word   aunt marcie and les   excuse me phrase   oh ya that's right phrase   phrase   linda   have they ever been to your place before  uh last summer   i love it up there  it's really wonderful  you know the place that we went to visit on the weekend at the  word yard is this  it was just a little ski shack you know  mhhm  and uhm   what's phrase   coz cozy they're very cozy  they really are  i don't know i really love the ski shack phrase  they couldn't get that they couldn't get that  mhhm   i like the fact that phrase   phrase rainmaker phrase    isn't that amazing  that really is amazing and all the houses that there word a wee bit of a word    mhhm   you know  what if it still word that  mhhm probably  your place is wonderful  oh ya it it is  but it's not the same sort of feeling is it  you know it's the same  well your place ah word  and i actually talked about it last night we went out for dinner actually  and we were talking about our future and i said how   how do you see yourself   phrase   i don't even know  i can't imagine me being at that word  lake   no you can't  no you see i'm getting i'm beginning to feel that way too   i just think i'd be way too isolated  ya i i said to name  i can't see our lives changing that much except we may have an apartment and go to the end of tape   do and can't wait to get there and then come home because we have things to do  yup  phrase which we not have  ya  uhm you know i volunteer there or word  tremendous job  well you know like for i don't know how long do you see yourself looking for   i know it's a bad day to ask kind of maybe  laugh word   this is exactly the conversation we had last night and i don't think i'd have to work anywhere around fifty  i c can   i almost ten years i'll probably work   i bet i will   i word sometimes   i'm sure i worked i worked ten or fifteen years  of course  i word word the other day that my word home   uhhn  laugh   laugh   i she said i could buy a car and move here  i said okay laugh   laugh ya you know that's a phenomenon that we all have to get used to because uh the economy is such that the children today are you know are there's not a  they don't have a job in hand   i say word   mhhm   they don't have a job and i think they're quite aware of the situation the the  plight of the uhm of the uhh financial status in the in the country   ya  they really can't just they got  word bigger bills than i did because   they they're more realistic i think   ya  well i think and i think maybe there was a false sense and though not necessarily given to them but i think that they are probably acquiring a false sense of freedom in the fact that they are at university and they're paying for their   they're paying for their uhm uhh room and board and you know even they're out of residence and into the into the  house we're happy to pay for  that and they're getting the sense that oh isn't it wonderful to have my own place and then they and that's all over again and they're not doling out the rent  mhhm   mhhm   but then they're not 
Canada	 they're not going to be able to find it unless  they have a great job  no   so i'm word we'll have word  back too  i think perhaps thinking of moving out of the house and into an apartment's a bit premature  perhaps   well we talked about that last night too  and morris said we and word said   well their children are gone  ya but you see they're in that words    somebody said to me yesterday gone as in university or gone as in forever   laugh that's true   and i said gone as in university and she says ya well don't hold your breath  that's true   you know   so i was speaking to uhm cough i don't know what her name is but she is ah she was having a kind of   word of word fair trade in uhm   word   steve hammond   steve hammond used to be positional chief of the children's and he is no longer positional chief  because i think there have been two since he/-> since he   was he had that  word   right   oh i know who  and then there right up at the top at personnel i guess words   right she's gone   ya she's gone and she's   yes she's always at the pool  oh okay you well you know she spoke to me yesterday on the fruit bar and she said uh you know are you still swimming and ah in the  word machine and i said no actually that i  hadn't hadn't been sitting in it for four years   and and then she said well i know who you are because she said i pass you in the street all the time my name is  i don't know what her first name you know  i can't remember  word or dorothy or  something  mhhm   and we had the nicest talk words   words   she's very chatty   word in and out of the  store and uh we went from sort of swimming to uhm uh country  capital to children and uhm i don't know i even thought of that time word about any difficulties in life   just really sort of about word minutes but it was always spontaneous and natural and uhm word  she left i said thank you so much for stopping me  mhhm   mhhm  you know i probably walked by her all the time and never looked at her  i would i wouldn't even  i wouldn't have even known her before   well she recognized me because her daughter was a patient up on the seventh floor  where word and i work  oh  and i would walk by in the hallway and i'd really you know  her face was familiar but i would never look at her and think where   d do i know this person from   yes you might have thought she just worked in the hospital  and then we're at the pool i don't know how she started to talk to me   interesting  i remember it was really nice  mhhm  but she's the one who said to me i said oh well   we were talking about me going back to work and how uh i liked it uh i liked it but that i found returning to work after twenty years as an adjustment itself   mhhm mhhm   to say nothing of the fact of uhm adjusting to a profession where there was just uhm so much work to be done at home  right   you know it wasn't just go it wasn't just going out and doing something else which in itself would be fun but but it it  words   words at home  mhhm ya it takes up an awful lot of time and uh she  said asked me how long the hiatus had been and i said eighteen or twenty years and she said she went back after fifteen years and she found it difficult too  mhhm   and then i said i'll talk with word as sort of suffering from empty-nest which kevin believes  and she said oh god she said i had five children i couldn't wait for them to go  laugh   but she said words she said we had one child who we're still having trouble but she didn't elaborate   and i didn't ask and uh she just sort of gave me that headache look  and uh uhm and she just uh anyway it was it was just sort of along those lines but uhh  no   mhhm   she never bought a place up at sardona  oh really  she said she and heath bought a log cabin uhh i don't know how many years ago she said  i thought it was heath's word   no i think it was carrie   maybe it was the two of them  she said we're building our own log cabin  oh of course that just i just like the sound of that   it's an oasis  ya  words were saying last night that  word place in the khyber's place is a home  yes   it's a place that you could retire to  because it's it's like a home  uhh ya   and our place is really a country place  but is that why you say you don't you can't  see yourself re retiring   at there because uhm the house itself   it's the house itself  it's adorable and cozy but there's no breathing  space   ya   ya   i know   it's it's a short term  okay  but if you have a s if you had ah ah if it was a bigger place could you see yourself living in the country full time   no  no you see that's words   word   that no  there's not nothing to keep me here  i'm not a gardener eight hours a day  i can't leave everyday of my life  no  uhm words work   to work from there to work from there it would be difficult i think cos you're kind of in the middle of nowhere  i'd have to go to st-jovite so   well that wouldn't be too bad  no  actually that wouldn't be too bad would it  words word  see up there  do you do you know the sopranos   well i know him  they they're moving  they're moving up north permanently  really words   words   they're making the move  ste-anne-du-lac  oh really  well maniwak really  they're making the word   words or something  what   you know that's the benefit to him in the community because they probably don't have any opthamologists  no they probably don't  i don't know whenever i go up there i think oh gosh i'd love to live here permanently but i think at the time i'm in the i'm in sort of a frame of mind where i falsely imagine that my day to day life would be as it is on the weekends which is sort of full of projects and uhmm uh i don't know full of projects that i enjoy doing  word   but of course once you move your day to day life into the place where you usually holiday it takes on a different uh   it's a different landscape so word   exactly in fact jack ah jimmy's  brother who's retired took a little retirement and and  thought that he would love it  and he carves ducks and he and he said you know i used to carve ducks when i was stressed at work and i'd come home and words or if i felt like doing it  mhhm   mhhm  i don't want to spend my life carving ducks  laugh i know  so he ya he's going through a big adjustment now  well i think you know i think   that hobbies aren't enough to keep you you you  dream about having time to do that or things that you'd like to do  but uh i think being off work this term is uhm   has really has really shown me   that first hand is that despite the fact that i was so busy stressed and and uhm very stressed probably more stressed then i needed to be but uhm without it i didn't have the same sense of fulfillment at all  mhhm   no  nor did i  but see i could see myself getting more involved in my career  but right now i can't because of my words   word and my children   i know   do you ever do you ever think of how nice it would be uhm to not have all these other commitments  or not necessarily how nice it would be i e word    words   i'm curious to see how far you might take  your career  right   just to see how far you might get given the  given the uh conditions that would allow you the freedom   to focus words   to do to prove that  words   yes well i remember when the children were babies and i used to think as soon as they're go to school i will do this  now it just gets bigger and bigger words  and i'm totally committed to them right now  my passion is them and not my career  it happens words   and you know what will happen i may never have the career that i thought i would   no   the minute you words off  words   words   you might have it for a few years  maybe  if sam is not still living at home if he is really out of town i could probably give it  words but because   morris' profession is such that  he is never at home either so i don't really  mhhm   cough   mhhm   no it's like raymond's hours are similar  i could never get into it   and i may just also feel like that because i realize that there are so many different things i'd like to explore  but i don't want to explore them at the expense of my   family   no   and what was suddenly family time in terms of like the fireplace and well i just mean in terms of family commitments where if my head is on something that pertains to family  that's the ch and you know my head is also on school and one has to take first place there's not question  no   there's not question  there's not question  there's not question words   so of course it all hinges on my  feeling to say yes to everything  and and to have the total amount of energy that you want for your career it drains you for your family i'm  oh ya ya   there's a young word i talked to you about her before and she has three children and she is a researcher and she's amazing and she's doing her master's and she does her   she's only taking two or three courses at a time but you know  she's she's young she's   that is unbelievable  three children works full-time and taking her master's  but she lives but she lives in lussier and her husband's a policeman who works who works crazy hours  mhhm  and she was telling me the evening nurses about the problems sh  she her son is having at school and uhh   she's she's fighting with her professor and she's thinking of quitting school and i think the writing's on the wall for that woman  come on   her son who's who's had problems before obviously and all of her children are younger than madie   i mean her eldest is younger than madie   not like he's thirteen   oh ya  that's the tough part   words it's a   it's a tough thing   mhhm  the life of a grad word   ya  we're all looking for that purpose that thing in   in life that's going to fulfill us  and uhm i think we're all guilty of going off in the wrong on the wrong tangent trying find out  whereas basically it's just sleep with with  sleep with as many people as you can  ya   but but remember that little thing i had on ahh on my bed  uhm i don't know any remedy  i don't know that i can uhm what i would  word ahh   i cannot give you the formula for success but i can give you the formula for failure you can't please everybody   exactly  you know and ah   and another thing too with all the cutbacks since i don't know if i told you this i told louise  at work with all the cutbacks and people maybe working four days instead of five or three days instead of four or five that we could ehm ehm get back to basics and give back to the community uhh get involved  right 
Canada	 i really think that would that's a bit naive   i'm just wondering about these people  well it's not so nai naive and you know i'm naive in the fact that uhm people who have been uhm  caught up in in the fast-pace demanding  uhm uhh frenetic lifestyle that they've that they've been  that they have been uh forced to live in or believed to feel there's important to live in for the last what two decades or  something to give them a four day work week and think that on that fifth day they're going to as you say get back into  volunteering and the board of something or other and dedicating their one day to that   i don't think that   mhhm   mhhm   it can't happen   well i don't think so because it's not part of their uhh it's it's not part of their raison d'etre i suppose  no   it's too bad because i agree with you  i thought it'd be wonderful you know go in to the hospital and seeing patients at at   dinner   oh i just i think words    mhhm   and i i'd love to do that  mhhm  i would love to do that  you know what i'd love to do i'd like to that too actually i'd like to do i i  saw a program on t v word that word  weekend and uhm we were watching the news and there  was what's that program that comes on just after the ten o'clock news and  the magazine or something and it was ah about this school called john stubbs   mhhm   the magazine   you heard of it  nope  well i think it's on hillside down near the   montre montreal westmont examiner    okay   and it's a school for autistic children  oh really  uhm they introduced words to the director of this school and she just seemed like uhm just a fireball  just wonderful  mhhm   and uh then there're just little scenes taken within the school uhm and there was uhm one session going on with these children when they were playing music and there were volunteers in there and they had the children that were moving with word   and ah uhm trying to instill in them an an  awareness of other sort of sensory uhm i don't know pleasures  and other things and uh  mhhm   right   look very closely on my pants  oh  isn't that beautiful  ya  words fat   look at how the lord has blessed us  they're so beautiful aren't they   they are  ya  uhm i don't know there it was it just grabbed me by the throat i said to morris write this i   i'm going to follow on monday and i'm going to volunteer on friday   i'm off on friday there's no reason why i can't  work a five day work week four days at  four days at concordia   and and one day there  mhhm   right   but see i haven't because i'm so relieved when friday comes to have a day to dedi   dedicate though to dedicate to chores and things   that i have to do here that i don't do it but it's an ins that's what i'd like to do  well that's it   exactly   oh god  i would love to do that  and i've known not words in me  words   no  i should just go one day and see you know if i had to go even a friday morning for two hours  what would that do out of my friday  nothing   right   it's once you make the commitment and you drop it out of into your life like i'm doing word  and word in in  june and i'm committed to that two those four tuesdays tuesday meetings or whatever  mhhm   and uh so i won't go into work  if they want me to work i'm i told them i'm not working  so you see word in the fact that  that obstacles in the way of us getting uh failing in   ourselves ourselves and word  job too because you know there are many conferences  for uhm e s l english as a second language teachers many of them a around the city and   and there's one interesting one going to take place between  concordia uh english language institute and community education  word institute uhm called university word  and then i began words the letter   uh that we received in our box there's uhm it's   the any other language school uh whether in canada or whether in our you know in our uhm sort of close to us  geographically uhm that teachers with sorry teachers with si similar   methods that we use   mhhm   right right   and so they're going to c  come ah ah meet and uhm meet and discuss and see if there's any possibility perhaps for exchange or observation hours or between the schools   mhhm   and i i and   they they said are you interested and i just put not at the present time  but when is  when is the time   when is the time  ya ya do i do that which i'd be very interested in doing or go and work with these autistic children to to give as you say something back to the community or is going to this conference giving something back to the community  well i think you have to follow your instincts and that you said not at present time it's the same as me not going to vancouver  mhhm  i struggled with that because it's good for my career it's good for me personally but it was the wrong time  i know you did ya   ya the timing was wrong  so i really uhm   i just i'm having a difficulty tying myself down to one thing so maybe i'd be i wouldn't be  somebody that would get full throttle into uhh one area of my life because i just want to be trying other things   it's hard to say you're s you're  word at it  words words  have another option  words   well i know  words i bet there's a rush  words   mhhm   mhhm mhhm   well are we going to change things and   and get involved without word   for two times  right   well i think that's very uh that's very  common that anybody in words   words  words   words   i i know what you're saying  i lived in/-> i've lived in a lot of different areas and uh that perhaps the passion for it is wonderful  and i don't have that passion for this for this whether it's something i deliberately set myself not to have because of what's going on with arnie uhha   or whether i just don't have it  that's an interesting question  and you know i pursue it in my words    cos there there's  other things that we put up around us  we do it subconsciously word  have   mhhm   your eyes are the same colour as your sweater  oh really they're not words   words   no laugh words   it's absolutely amazing they are identical in  colour to your sweater word that  sweater on   seriously   i know ya  ya it's really pretty  uh that's a very interesting question   we might not ever know the answer to that the fact that how do you set yourself up words interest is  words because it's  a a safety net for me and you know what  words   yes   or you go out and you're just not  interested   i'm not interested yup  it's interesting  that's very interesting   words it's something i've never got to before before and i've been meaning to ask  it's been asked  four years that i've been at the same environment and uhm  i would say two of it are not excited by it  they're not excited by the academic part of it  no   which i usually am excited about the   aca academic part of anything i've been involved in  i used to love going to the library and doing things  i'm not excited by the technical part of it because i've done it all before  is that because the political word  atmosphere you know word because of  conflict between the research work that you're doing  and the and the clinical work you're doing  it is it is causing  i don't know what it would word   but driving a wedge in words   i think there's   it's that's part of it   i think that words   well it's it's made me uncomfortable because i'm not sure of my my   it's the whole thing that's wrong with that clinic  and there's lack of structure and supervision from the day went there it's been like that  mhhm   it's turmoil  it's word and chaos and you know i do not as much as i'm pretty organized all the time i have to really  word / [ >   ya that's that is   word like a place that's that's   well organized  they don't like the chaotic situation because given a chaotic situation if you're not totally organized which is most of you because if you were it'd be word laugh  you'd need somebody to do that for you  mhhm   you'd need the structure you need  the system to do that for you   words   for years i've been words   now you'd think that that's chaos but  words that would be structure to deal with chaos   that there's a nice confusion    that would be such a nice confusion ya   ya well  so you know there are steps to take  and it doe doesn't   it doesn't happen there  it's really frustrating there   did it happen at the other clinic that you worked at  mhhm  do you miss that  mhhm  uhha  could you go back and work there  ya but i don't want to back and work there  right   i need to get away from that type of work   ent entirely   but i think bo both types of work that you've been doing with terminally ill patients  is ah is very demanding  it's very demanding   ya  you're meant to be there  well ya but i'm you know i told you that the  c s c and quite interesting in that  department   mhhm   that's a word word  mostly  yes they did baby care they do ah pre-natal classes they do all kinds of things  it it's like a city in there word   well i know that's what's kind of interesting  about it   what would i be doing people phone rings   get them word in the hospital  like morris you know uhh uh coming in and half the kids have an ear ache   the brown paper word   word a good idea   yup  oh okay i'll lift it up there  as soon as you leave i'll go there and lift it  i mean ya i guess i laugh   laugh lift it where  words oh i see the cup on the bureau  words words   words ya  actually there is a small desk down there that is about it's not quite as long as that and it's maybe the  same same width  but don't forget that the word   ya  that ya do you think that that would do   uhm maybe  cos the bureau is high and and  the girth would be awkward  ya   well you don't want something that low because then you're bending word   bending over   i would rather have something a bit higher   alright okay well the bureau is certainly ah you know words   that's right and there're going to be eight foot  pieces of wood so  that's cool   ya   all right well then you know that will make jackson  happy  i've cleared out quite a bit  most of it  ya i took out about uh five or six boxes and a couple of bags of clothes  i'm just gonna try and recycle the clothes you like uh  civic duty but after sp spending  at least forty-five minutes on the phone and i only got to hear about a word in you know a couple of other areas and i thought no i'm not going to sit here  and try and figure out which  words   ya laugh   ya   no not waste your time   ya  so  and the paint i uh i  managed you know like if i'll just have to tell them listen  it's ah it's just gonna going to   have to sit here for a couple more days until i uh  words   words laugh   well a month laugh   no until words   no no no july july  july is at least my intent or something like that  alright   it's it's my next shot in this area  i'll be done by then so  right  good good  well i have probably told you uh that two by eight uh  words three pieces there  words a couple of pieces   good 
Canada	" good  and then they're they're  gonna going to make sort of a little nook here right  ya that's a little nook there  we can put those shelves  ya   ya   well this is twelve inches deep  ya  so we can either words a phrase that is cut off by speaker b   you know what there is gonna going to  be a lot more room down there when this happens  there really is   yup ya ya   cos having those those walls up there you know is really gonna going to   create a lot of floor space  mhhm yup  yes it will  but we can you know you can use ah ah some of the leftover plywood if you want to make the shelves for the nook  you know the the bits that are lopped off  to make the sh shelves   what do you mean to make the shelves   well if it's half inch plywood that they're using for the wall  that we have to cut like here okay we need two pieces but we're only using a few inches of the second one  so unless we can use it we can use it somewhere else words of the shelves   ya   mhhm   oh you mean you think words the shelves   ya get them get something hmm ya   well i found uhm a couple of brackets you know holders   that let to fit words to fit into it  ya   we found three of those uh individual but not as nice as that  okay  i guess i'll have to words   you don't necessarily want this kind  no no that would be very strong  no   no  no that's just for decorating to hold up little shelves that hold up word like that like that  well for this you figure is really gonna   going to be the tricky bit huh  yup yup  cos that's where the complicated cutting comes in and that's where you have all those wires and pipes and uh  ya but remember they're gonna going to   do it on the inside  ya  so it's really gonna going to   be about avoiding all those wires and pipes  mhhm   that's true  ya  so the the tricky part is just  gonna going to be cutting for the stairs  mhhm  that's really well  well  and then do you want to paint it on your side anyway  ya  so  talked about it word   i'm gonna going to put i have uh you remember that words thing   yes  ya  yup you're gonna going to mount that down there  where  in that part of the basement  it occurred to me that you know that if   if it all it needs is to just have something to hold it up really  oh ya  there's nothing to putting it up  no the box is down there already  right  you showed me the box  there's an electrical box in the ceiling and  ya   oh ya that's right  well no this one i think this is uhm the set  to be plugged in remember  ya   oh so you just plug word   word   no this doesn't even get fitted into a box  okay  in fact th and there are two of them down there   there's that one which is and then there is another one which is about half the length   so i thought that what i'd do word that the dryer the washing machine instead of over here  mhhm   and i thought that what i would do is put the laundry room  in here sort of going that way and the shower room  in here going that way  ya   okay  and then over here there is that box and so i could just get him to fit in something ya  right so you just get word something    and then maybe get something for above the washer-dryer  and then   you know there is something actually right above the washer-dryer  okay  there is there's a it's not working but there's uhm   oh that's right the one with the broken word    ya ya   so that's that's like about here or  something so if i move this one here there should be plenty of light right  yup   oh ya  ya you won't even need a new one in here i think  if you've got these two  mhhm   well ya cos there's this you know the that  little room in there that doesn't have any kind of lighting in there at all  you might put one in the in the  room  ya i've got that lamp that i use now over the uh  mhhm  so all i really need is is places to plug in is all i really need  ya   mhhm  that's a good point i'll need a pl   place i need a box back here to plug in   yes  well where are the outlets now in the basement  for plugging in  ya  there's one right about here  oh so it's not where are the oulets it's where's the outlet  that's it  laugh okay  that's it extended word "" thhhaaaaat's it"" but  this thing over here well you can screw it can't you screw in something that   ya we have things that you can screw  in  fixtures that   ya   ya   ya  for plugging in  how many  you can get them with either one or two uhm  word   really   and you can get them so that you put this  you screw this outlet in and then screw the lightbulb in to the thing that has the outlets in it  mhhm   ya so you have two outlets and a and   lightbulb   and a lightbulb  is that dangerous  no i don't think so  well then that's simple that's what i'll do  and uhm the one thing that plugs in here and the other thing that plugs in over here is going to plug in over here  mhhm  this one uhm never got its switch put on it  i see   and i'm not going to have to have a switch put on it  these two put the plug in out  we'll put the plug in whenever we want it word   ahh okay oh  they're very awkward  ya  word ya  but that's the way we did it  mhhm   okay   that sounds pretty good  ya it's going to be nice down there  yup  ya  there's going to be uh one one thing that isn't going to be fun is uh the evening is uhm  cabinet   ya  well we're going to empty it before we move it  ya we'll look through the books and see if there's  you know i i just i'm a collector   i hate to throw away books  ya no i know words books   and especially now that i've got andy  i feel that you know i i   feel terrible throwing away anything  ya  have you ever been like that word   oh ya laugh   laugh   word hard like word  ya  anyway very good thing word   the size of this basement i suggest that you go down there right this very minute  word   laugh i remember the work on word  i i could do that you know   even if we had the lumber and everything down there and the nail-gun  ya it still would be too noisy  ya  people would get upset  and  ya ya they'd complain maisy would bark  you know   i would shoot about two nails into the floor and i'd be ready for bed  word laugh    laugh   ahh gee i wonder word maybe andy  can be there for some of that  he'll love that  he'll help it  uhha  i do know how much help he'll be laugh   laugh good good just keep him away from the gun  if i could stand it i'd invite the father to come over  and help us  do you think he'll be any help  laugh and you could keep him away from the gun too  ya word   laugh   laugh   oops  laugh   laugh   just kidding words   good good  ahh no no no   well there we go  alright well i think those are all the supplies we need  about those chairs you don't do you remember what they look like word   no  no  which chairs are we talking about  uhhm well i guess you never really saw those chairs did you  you know i think you didn't  that's right cos you never really you know we never really got to know each other until after i left him right  ya   you know extended phrase   words his furniture  that's right   yup  ya  no i was never in here other than word    audible inhale she's got some wooden chairs uh with uhh browns you know sort of colours and sort of well and they're kind of  oh ya they sound nice  mhhm i'm wondering if we should have a garage sale  hmm  i already asked you that and you said you didn't have anything to sell  not really i'm ah   laugh word many books  no i don't uh i don't part with my books  no  want to store some of mine  laugh uh   you've got that nice big storeroom at the back  you know you've word you really don't have much newspapers in there word you got lots of room   ya right   laugh   aw that's where i house most of my books but i'm  running out of bookshelves so it will soon be time to find a   sp space a space in the apartment for new bookshelves  i think it will soon be time to find a new apartment   laugh god you know that apartment it certainly will be big enough for rhianne and me  but i'm not moving in there  well it wouldn't be convenient for you on the second floor   no not at all no  well  well  uh huh  everytime i go down there i just you know i just try to  realize what it's all going to look like  of course to make it even bigger you could knock that little room down and open up that space if you're walling off this whole area  ya but then i uh taking down walls means that you gotta got to move shelf space doesn't it  but you don't have any shelves on those walls do you  i do   oh you do  on the inside ya  okay  i've got uhh those plastic milk crates you   know all lined up you know here and i've got stuff in them  oh ya   well those could still be lined up against the back wall   i can see this is not a popular idea   well no the thing is that if i  if i lined them up against the back wall then it would be harder for me to get to the stuff that is on those cement  levels  ya ya  right  mhhm   ya that's true  well okay  words   nevermind   i don't know  no it's uh it was just thought  ya see what i'm thinking of doing is taking you know all these books that i have over here that are sitting uh you know on the other side the washing machine  there   ya   mhhm   it you know it seems to me that this would be a big enough space to hold it cos it it's   wide here  oh ya it is  you know  yup  so it it really could take all of the books and i think that would be a better place for them cos they're close to the washing machine  and i don't know if it you know when it's hot water  there's steam and   there you know it comes out so it seems to me that  ya   ya   so i guess that all of that you're probably right i'd have more room to uh   ya but it's uh it's  not uh not crucial  you know i might think about it actually  ya  words easy for us to take it down would it  it wouldn't take very long would it   no it wouldn't take uh very long at all  words light words   make it it would make it feel big eh  it would  ya  well then what you could do is is maybe redistribute these lights  put this one more in the centre of this area  ya   ya  and ah it would be bigger and brighter  ya   ya  why couldn't there be a window down here  ya  there is you know but it's been boarded off  it's just above well you know where it is just where  the uh   it's in the little well just outside here "
Canada	times   okay we have a couple of things we have to look at okay  words better we have to plan a  calendar over the next couple of  months   mm hmm  mm hmm  cos there's ah there's a lot of things on our plate  uh huh  uhm there's uhm there's uh  a vacation  mm hmm  and we're pretty much deciding we're gonna  going to do that with the last two weeks in july right  mm hmm  ah we have to figure out what day exactly we fly out  what's the day words july   before we discuss that i'd like to sc   discuss the stairs  stairs now  yeah intake of breath   if the kids are going you know to be get  be in day camp the first two weeks of vacation i'm still thinking maybe you could if you wanna want to do this work  is it their vacation  yeah  word   in june   the last week of june and the first week of july  the last week of june you words   mm hmm   word said it was word  yah  june  okay we i think the last day of the week is a thursday right  thursday or friday yeah  so uh thursday's june twenty - ninth june thirtieth is the friday  ahh so we two weeks after that is when the kids okay the kids are in day camp   that week already  so   yeah   yeah  and day camp they got one more week after that  and that's when you think we should do the stairs  yeah   uhmm so what you want me to take a week off of work and do the stairs is that the idea  yeah   okay cos what i what i thought we could do with the stairs is try to spread it out o over a couple of weekends   i'd rather not spread it out over several weekends  i'd rather we get it done  shit laugh   laugh   i don't wanna want to spread it over weekends  i wanted you to words   i mean word i mean   sigh   i really don't  either hire somebody to do it or else we do it in one shot  and we hire somebody to work with you   a helper  sh   anyway i'm not sure  i mean i the trouble is that   the s the stairs okay the problem is  the long room upstairs  mm hmm  and i think the priority should actually be to get the  long room done before we touch the stairs   the reason being that we're definitely having the floor sanded in the kitchen  mm hmm  uhmm  in august  uhmm yeah  do that august  and we definitely want to have the dining room  done at the same time  mm hmm  if the stairs for whatever reason can't be done by then then keep it in mind that the stairs probably won't be a uh uh se se separate issue  okay they can be done before we can do them after  because we're not gonna going to be sanding them at the same time  there are <?several word we're  gonna going to do ourselves  a few words sanding the kitchen  floor   words sand it  mm   yeah   uh huh   and uuuuh we're seeking perfection words  yeah it's good i uhn  sentence   yeah  okay but the stairs  okay but but   when we do the stairs and we tear up the stairs and do all the work on it why do we want k kids roaming round the house   sentence   why don't we use that week   are you afraid the kids are gonna going to  word or fall down the stairs or  something   it's gonna going to  be a mess  it's gonna going to be a mess   what mess is that  cos it's a little dusty work  okay  and it's it's the kinda  kind of work where you you have to  words tear out the carpets  mm hmm   okay   and you have to scrape all the glue off the stairs  mm hmm   and the a sharpened scraper will only you can actually do a pretty clean job scraping that glue off okay   why do you have to scrape to take the uh glue off if we're  gonna going to get rid of that wood anyway   ah my assumption is that we're not gonna  going to do the whole thing in one week  okay i mean we can do it in one week and do the  word laundry room in that week and we'll have to   ladder ladder walk up and down the stairs during that week okay   so i dunno don't know how many  steps we'll get done how many days it's gonna going to  take us to to do the entire staircase okay  basically i think that you for you know over two or three days  you're gonna going to have half  half of your new staircase in place while the other half of your staircase is still ah still there  yeah i hope so   if you're gonna going to scrub the glue off and get all the glue off and then we're gonna  going to be throwing that stuff away then why should take the glue  i understand it's not such a good job getting all the glue off  if y if you sharpen the scraper quite a bit it comes off quite quite   uh cleanly  i guess my my idea is really first get rid of all the carpet glue all the dirty stuff  then we've got these bare wooden stairs here   and then what you do is like i said it's probably gonna  going to be over a few weekends  like that first weekend we'd do maybe the bottom two stairs or the bottom half of it   and the following weekend we'd do maybe aah the next six steps  and the weekend after words we'd have  the other six steps  and then   can't we take a week each  take a week  i mean the weekends were gonna going to  be when we do something else   i could take maybe a couple of extra days off  okay  i don't think i'm gonna going to take  a whole week off  okay i i don't think i have  words   i got four weeks of vacation okay this year  mm hmm  i don't feel like giving up a whole week of my vacation  to uhm do up our house   clause with  taking the carpet off word   that's exactly what i'm saying  that's exactly what it is that i'm saying   that is what you're saying   i'm say i'm saying that  we do as much as we can of it  what doe the little things  that you know ahh you can get out of the way  you get that done with in your spare w   spare time in the weekends  mm hmm  okay  and then when you're ready for the big part of the job okay   re replacing the actual steps and all that and carpentry okay  that even that okay words  you wouldn't wanna want to spread it over you know too many weekends that i could do it in and it could take  i could do that in two long weekends  okay i could take maybe a monday off two weeks in a row  i'll take a monday off and a friday off  words the weekends in july or when do you think you're gonna going to do this   uh i could do it maybe i could do it in june or uh  so take the long weekend th that week that  th in july when they're in camp   you know  er i i just think if they're   gonna going to be in camp then we should probably use that time as much loud tumbling noises to end of utterances  as possible to get stuff done  sigh   whispers to a about their children ask him if he wants some  well then i spose suppose uhm   i i yeah  if you wanna want to do it that week we can do it that week  what i'm saying is that if we get started before  i mean then we'll get stuck in and we can do the carpet and at least get that out of the way  and uh words   sentence uhm yeah we'll do that  words what you wanna want to  do words the kids words   okay   kay okay   okay so so what do we have here   a hamper  sigh   i i'm wanna want to try and size up exactly what's involved okay  i mean when i s once i start   taking these carpets off then i can take a closer look at what shape  the stairs are in how much work is involved okay   how capable i am of doing it myself  okay once i can do that i'll have a better idea   nn and how capable i am of doing it myself okay  i might to be able to do it myself and uhhh   if i run into like more like technical difficulties okay things that uh ah i just don't have the experience or the knowledge to know how to solve the problem maybe i'll uh ask marcel  words   words done he can come over and gimme  give me some advice uh for around fifty bucks an hour we'll do that okay  but uh i don't really think okay that i need a helper for the physical part of the work okay   it's the kind you wanna want to   do one step at a time and words one step at a time okay  it's not something where you can have one guy doing word  the stairs and the other one guy going down the stairs  okay   okay okay  sentence   i haven't even got to tell you that i've  word those stairs over the railings you know  y- you do them one step at a time   one stair at a time  sigh okay   okay  so  so then our goal is to get that outa out of  the way by first week in july is that it  yeah   before we go on vacation  okay   yeah   okay have you looked into this vacation business in a while  no sigh   i saw the number i'm gonna going to   have to call the number   i dunno don't know   i haven't thought about it no   have you  no   okay well   talk about quebec city laugh   laugh   it's easier   so we'll go to quebec city   your sister's arriving two weekends from

night right  yeah  that's two days i mean they they're   probably gonna going to wannu   want to invite us over to their place and all that  kinda kind of thing word   i don't wanna want to do that i   wanna want to be somewhere   words yeah  words in quebec city unless you know they invite us for supper or something in sainte-anne   she actually lives up here sainte-anne-de-beaupr&eacute;  i heard she was out in words  she used to be  mm she used to be but she's not anymore  she lives in uh words  sainte-anne-de-beaupr&eacute;  intake of breath so we'll leave about eight or nine in the morning

Canada	 we don't have to spend two weeks in cape breton so  how long do you wanna want to stay in cape b cape breton in the campground up there  a week  probably one week  five days  max  move on   voc i'm sure it's a very nice place but i mean  there's only so much of interest for us see right  so we're gonna going to go to the louisbourg and they can   there's the park up there we wanna want to   go to louisbourg mabou   you wanna want to go to glace bay  or ingonish i don't know i wonder what yet  anyway i'll call this number i saw get the stuff  words or voc each of these places is one

nova scotia  mm hmm  in one trip  three or four words laugh   halifax is   well you know we'll have to see  if we can manage word to  there's a lot to see in halifax[2.20ish? - - chk from here down]  oh right like what  well it's nice  i like word in halifax  wow well i i was so tired i didn't see anything other than word and a couple of restaurants  there is the citadel the word the  word   what

villages  mm hmm   intake of breath umm   so it is nice to go there  we'll have to see if we have time   well what you you you don't like to do too much travelling  mm  you just you want basically  pack down plan it for two places and concentrate on those places  or  okay so what we do with two places is we can get in halifax  well cape breton's a big place  words you leave the cape breton  which is where the park is  mm hmm  and then you have to drive down to word   placename and i mean you don't go there just for half an hour i mean it it's far  mm hmm  it'll be far i think  so we'd stay at the top in the park in cape breton for a couple of days  then drive down to louisbourg stay another day maybe  mm hmm   mm hmm  there's this place baddeck which is sort of a tourist spot  nice  they told me that's where there's some word  graham bell museum  okay but  mm hmm  a week is a reasonably long time to spend in cape breton right  cape breton ?  oh yeah  words   i don't know  no i'd say five days to a week yeah  okay  a week there is nice you know[4.45]  so if we budget say three days to get from montreal  to cape breton  and we budget another two days okay maybe we'll say three days to get back from say halifax to montreal  three days to get back?  mm hmm  uhm hmm   and once uhm we keep on driving something in the line of eight hours a day   so uhm if we're going for two weeks two weeks is like uh   well it's it's sixteen days you just wanna want to   so we can we can we can we try it  mm hmm  sixteen days  mm hmm  so in travel time it's uh six days  mm hmm  and then  so you have ten days  that leaves ap approximately   ten days which you can get about five days in cape breton five days in halifax  i don't want five days in halifax   six days in cape breton five days in halifax  in that region we'd be   what  yeah words yeah  and that would be   word   okay in that region we'd be camping somewhere else  we're not gonna going to be staying at a hotel in

everything   under breath oh god  even if words you can't  words words   words what the logistics are  i'm even prepared to go camping in the car words  park and sleep on the road  yeah yeah  yeah right okay  so we'll have to get the package anyway loud thumping noises for about 20 secs, starting during last utterance   well like i say we should we sho we should probably word nova scotia tourism or something annnnnnnnnnnnnnn and   and maybe even i dunno don't know maybe even decide to rent a cabin for one week somewhere i dunno   don't know   it would be nice to be in a cabin in the word  in cape breton  mm hmm  and probably the most practical thing  yeah   so  so let's stay in words   then maybe i dunno don't know maybe  words fredericton  in fredericton there's fredericton's a nice town and nice cemetary word which i've never been to  historical word i guess it is provincial park  i should ask margaret too we're sure about this region  slow loud breath   probably a national park  mm  i'm gonna going to get this stuff  i'll pull it this weekend  so we start the tour in n nova  scotia and then when we get there just pass through  okay  and what week would you be back  well i g y yeah  yeah yeah yeah  i mean you do one or the other y   you know  it's out of the way and it's hard and far enough eh  i can't believe i mean yeah people do drive these distances eh  mm hmm   you know people go you know two or three words and it's so complicated to get there and  no i'm not looking forward to this trip either  three or four words   you pers the driving  or  no  whoever's doing the driving can just   spending three days in the car  laugh   laugh   i mean you're going to the main route uh cape cod  it's like uh what six or seven hour drive max okay  and uh two words to be here  so you don't wanna want to fly  d'you do you wanna   want to fly   no i don't word   i i don't think we can afford to fly  well we'll have to rent a car  word   under breath kay okay   so that's july   august we get there  a day sanding in the kitchen  and then it's time to go back to work  and now it's time to start building the country house  laugh   uhm   so word if you're up to it  mm hmm  i discussed word   i was talking to words loud breath   so i am trying to get the price down okay  and the most you know words   no i don't laugh   two or three words   i offered them about seven thousand dollars so that the home  project becomes affordable  that's a price words to knock off okay  and so you know we keep asking them like you know   word we've lived in the house for a while words having the house for a while  where there's an unconditioned living room inside you know  so that's what it might come down to  basically i told him words   i mean we've got a toilet and stove  and it's you know   it's more than two words right  so sentence   words gibrock  laugh   laugh   for the walls  what  open wires live wires  laugh oh is that is that  what you thought was expensive okay  and sheeting gibrock is you know five bucks or something okay  and you know it's a lot of work okay  sentence   words trim and that kind of stuff  words instead of just plumbing  uh buckets paint  it would be heated  word okay the word  it would be heated  yeah   what else  i don't know exactly okay but i realise it's   laugh a lot of work words   laugh   three or four words and uh   words you just you you if you   word that stuff a friend there's this  there's this   basically there's two advantages okay one is that you don't have to pay for it up front   uh but in working with it since you're not paying for it you can be up front with somebody else  it means you're you're saving it for yourself so you can do it yourself  mm  over a longer period of time which is when you save money  okay   right   use your leisure time to finish off your house  mm   yeah  mm hmm  mm hmm  laugh well the thing is i mean you know yeah  i if you're just going to put it off for a year you know there's not huge savings in it if you  do that you know  you're gonna going to have to fork out  to get someone in sooner or later anyway  and uh the only real saving is that words  you don't have to borrow it word and then pay interest on it   okay   so what else did you say  that's it  sentence   it's a murphy's law yeah trying to knock the price down  cos words s'gonna it's going to be a major effort word   we're probably gonna going to have to put a lot of time into trying to trim a lot more of these word  he's talking about   you know he thought it was a price expensive himself okay  and uh he says that uh he's gonna going to  try to go back and negotiate with the with the toronto peo- uh office okay  he's their builder right   he's a registered builder okay  word   mm hmm mm hmm  he's he's got his own  word business  he's been constructing houses for twenty years or something like that  uhm back two years ago or three years ago or something he  got a contract to build one of their houses okay  he liked their houses he liked their product and uh he decided he'd like to become a distributor for them  mm  so uh you know actually he's not just specializing in building those houses he uh he's capable of building words and     whispers oh my god to the children? so  he he uhm he has to work with the prices that they give him now  mm hmm  and i realize the price's higher than the basic level recording file ends [ same tape as above, side 2; file ft2b]  we might as well take care of that first though  right  word before i uh  i was just thinking about what happened to me today i was tape is switched off then on again   yeah  uhm i pulled into the parking lot at uh allan doolan two   right  and uh this van comes swinging round the corner and the guy yells out at me do you speak english  and i said yeah and he says uhm oh good he says i  i'm a i'm a st- i'm a stereo  delivery man and uh the company just screwed up  i've got these speakers in the back of my car in back of my van and uh they cost like fifteen hundred dollars apiece   you wanna want to buy em   them   like i'm just i'm selling them you know  so he swings open in the back of the van you know and he's got speakers in there   laugh oh god laugh oh no   they're not stolen i mean uh  you know he's just getting this it's just getting  a bit too pat  protesting a little too much   no n no it was a little bit too uh  rehearsed schpiel on how great the speakers were  and how much and uh  mm hmm   right   then i couldn't get away from it you know i  cou   oh my god   it was obviously a   good thing you didn't have any money on you  laugh words laugh   i was tempted for about a minute  yeah  and then i realized that it was a scam  yeah  and they drive around and they get people and uh try to sell them the thing and they would probably   yeah they probably do too  yeah yeah  they probably sell them  so   most people don't you know a lot of people probably don't question too much where these great fourteen hundred dollar speakers came fromÿ
Canada	 protesting a little too much   no n no it was a little bit too uh  rehearsed spiel on how great the speakers were   and how much and uh  mm hmm   right   then i couldn't get away from it you know i cou    oh my god   it was obviously a   good thing you didn't have any money on you  laugh words laugh   i was tempted for about a minute  yeah  and then i realized that it was a scam  yeah  and they drive around and they get people and uh try to sell them the thing and they would probably   yeah they probably do too  yeah yeah  they probably sell them  so   most people don't you know a lot of people probably don't question too much where these great fourteen hundred dollar speakers came from  well when he said they were fourteen hundred dollars apiece i thought wait a second  where does it you know  yeah   me and uh josh and i were actually  we were looking at apartments on the weekend and we went into this one place where the one of them was obviously a jazz like a musician and they had like all this jazz stu  stuff you know posters and things around and very expensive audio equipment and josh said this would be great for thieves you know  just spend a couple of days looking for apartments  you get to go around check out what people have you know   and in fact   but on on this part of town when you're looking at apartments they're usually empty these days around here  empty  aren't they  no   word the apart no  probably cos they're tryna trying to  sell them for july though   they're tryna trying to   rent them for july yeah   oh yeah   yeah  so you get to go out check out people's stuff and then you know  well it was a very very expensive piece of equipment they had and they weren't home  so   so maybe tape cuts out a couple of seconds?   i'm so   hey  so yeah we're yeah we're gonna  going to finance on you you know  actually two or three words   yes we found a place   and it's not a hundred percent sure but it's almost sure that we're in there   oh good where   words   it's on uh belgrave below sherbrooke  a bit it's on   it's one of those streets that's only below sherbooke  you know there's belgrave clifton regent and then melrose  okay  it's between hampton and melrose   oh yeah  anyway they're just they're just  below sherbrooke they don't continue above   and they're very nice   a are they like uh   like yours  they're one way kind of from   hmm  like like the same idea as what you've got now  no no no  what do you mean they're one way  they're one way streets so you'd go  they're quiet you know   word   oh okay   they're only between uhm de maisonneuve and sherbrooke so you have to go around and come back up  okay  and uh er they're mostly duplexes if they're  down towards de maisonneuve and the tracks there're a few kind of buildings and stuff but the upper part of the street is almost always duplexes  and it just happened in such a flukey way  we were uhm we rent we called around   we started looking thursday night like seriously you know and  we called around and we saw one dive on thursday  just oh just gross  words   word remember what it was like   what  word   oh it was just revolting  i mean we were we rang the bell we were  already running late and we laugh rang the bell and uhm   and these two laugh enormous dogs came barreling towards the door laugh jumping on us and like laugh  like they would eat the baby you know   right   and uhm there's a woman  this tiny little woman was struggling to control these huge dogs  she finally got the worst one of the two and locked it in the bathroom  and as we looked at the apartment word   in the bathroom of the apartment you were looking at  yes laugh   in the bathroom laugh the apartment we were looking at   and as we uhm as we looked at the place he was like  lungeing at the laugh door  and the other one was sort of kept  jumping up and tryna trying to bite dana 's foot or whatever  they were friendly but just those kind of crazy dogs  you know  out of control   and it was just it was a  place that had about two windows  the whole interior of the apartment was completely dark  no skylights no windows nothing  and uh just really you know those kind of places that have uhm  phone wire kind of painted and crusted to the baseboards laugh   laugh   you mean like here  like here yeah laugh but worse  yeah  and you know all the floors are scarred and the doors   are kind of they've been painted about fifty million times so they're about this thick and uhm   yeah and they look like they've been broken into a few times cos they  yeah  and just oh and the woman herself had been fixing up the place but it was one of those sort of jobs where the landlord says oh you can finish the basement if you want you know  laugh   and you're sort of thinking uh no thanks  words so it was two levels there  it was one uh we looked at the upper end of the  the lower but they were just that was just just hideous   and that's the one you got that they gave you   the one we got j was just  a fluke  it was ah a friend of a friend and we just happened to go to this woman's house and say we we stopped by to visit for a minute and we said you know do you know of any places around  we were with my mom and and she said do you know of anything around and and this woman said yeah when do you want it for i'm moving in july and my place is great  and we went to look at it and it is really nice  it's beautiful  sssssso so what kind of  word   it you know it's a six and a half  it's really big  it's got a deck in the back like  it's a it's the upper floor but they share the deck with the main floor the main   the people who live down there are nice  they have kids  oh okay   it backs onto an alley that's full of kids and really nice  you know like lots of nice families   two or three words backs  onto an alley that's full of rats  full of children playing   and uh it's really big it's got a beautiful bathroom with an old-fashioned tub and it's been but but it's been fixed up it's got new windows and   how would you compare it to the place you got now  oh tons better  i mean it's it's got some of the same things like stained glass windows and stuff but it's in much better shape  oh really  it sounds nice then   oh yeah   it's beautiful  and it's in a great spot  and uh m'i am i allowed to ask what it's worth  uh it's it's actually cheap  it's six sixty-five heated  wow  it's really cheap compared to some of the oth  we looked at one that was lovely but it was seven ninety  you know  yeah   where'd you see it  on regent  just off sherbrooke   oh yeah   cos i know uh uh jan and alexis are looking for a well a place  they looked at places that are i mean they only have the one well the one income and   i know   and they looked at places that are sort of eight nine hundred  they are closer to where we are  yeah yeah  well we looked at a lot in that area too but thing is  sigh it seems a lot farther away unless you drive all the   time   you know what i mean  yeah   and we don't necessarily we can't necessarily always do that so  i looked at a few that   yeah   yeah but like like where we are exactly where we are i think is is being  word   i i like sherbrooke  i like the street  mm hmm  cos when you walk down the street there's lots of things to poke around at   mm hmm   i i like where we are cos it's very uh very uh alive   lively   and that you can walk to all the uh you know all the services cos you've got the park i've got words    yeah yeah   we looked at some not exactly where you are but more like westbourne rosedale  and those streets  somehow didn't   yeah   but if you word too far  you ca it's i you feel    like i don't feel like i don't feel uhm i don't feel uh sorta sort of cut off because we're right on s on the main  road which has a bus or the uh thing   yeah   mm hmm yeah   yeah  you know it's easier not taking the car  yeah  but certainly if   but if you go a little deeper  yeah  like even if you go down to uhm you know on our street  or our type of street but closer to the park  closer to the   yeah  like fielding and chester kind of it's   it's not good to walk  no  it's kind of a depressed area around fielding  and south city and that cos it's that walk  through the uh  word   yeah   yeah   yeah   the other thing that i wasn't crazy about i mean i like your street and that with the houses on them but the the  streets we looked at with apartments they were all sort of modern  like sixties kind of apartments  oh yeah   really ugly   and they they they   had more of a feel of like apartment buildings even though they were only duplexes   because they had this sort of like uhm you know  that kind of flooring tile up the stairs and  yeah right   you know what i mean  like it was just it was more  apartmenty feeling  yeah   so   yeah   but the only thing is this place i mean the woman is  ninety-nine percent sure she's moving to colorado but if she flakes out on us at the last minute we're gonna going to be  uh upset yes  upset   but remember she had to give notice so she   she well she has   a ninety day a ninety day clause in her lease  and she's she's almost positive she's going  but it's just she tends to like to keep her options open a little bit and i kinda  kind of know her my mother sorta sort of   knows her  yeah   but we're pretty sure it's gonna going to work out  just the way it happened was sort of so n  destined you know   perfect   like the best way it happens   yeah  and it was perfect for us too the place  it's great  well it's funny how sometimes uh that kinda   kind of   i've always been optimistic especially  the type a of you know things that happen  yeah i am too   yeah   and uh usually just when you're at your  limit or when you think things are gonna  going to happen  something always happens   mm hmm   we we always we almost rented  this one that was seven ninety  it was a beautiful place but it was very uhm  it was expensive for us to pay that much  it was heated but still  heated   that's still a lot  to jump from five hundred to seven ninety is quite a  uh a jump  yeah   yeah   and it was also an apartment that was sort of almost too fancy for us in a way  like it was a bit of a kind of   like the people in there now are professors you know  and sorta sort of like   i dunno don't know it just didn't feel  you're a professor too  yeah  i know i'm a professor word but not that kind of professor you know  laugh   where where exactly was it  it was on regent just below sherbrooke  that's one west of melrose  and what was the other like  nice  the streets are nice  because they just it's just one block   i might uh   i might tell jan and alexis about that  cos i know that they're prepared to pay  i'm tryna trying to get them to buy 
Canada	 oh yeah  i'm tryna trying to get them to buy on our street  yeah  laugh you want some neighbours huh  but uh   well i want a neighbour  and i want a neighbour that uhm  you know i want a neighbour that i like  yeah   and also one with a kid that's   gonna going to be more or less the same age as   word   yeah when is she due  she's due in october  october first   right   marcie 's due in september  so uh   right   oh so that's really close  does she do they know what they're having  a baby  yes  no laugh   as opposed to a boy or girl  ah no i think she's doing the amnio possibly as we speak  or something   she's doing one  yeah  uh hmm  they uh i dunno don't know i mean it's a strange situation cos like we were immediately warned that there was a definite reason for it  mm hmm  and and i mean if  if you're gonna going to have an amnio and you aren't prepared to let's say you know have an abortion if you see something then why do it  mm hmm  like you know  and they're not  well jan has said tha-   i mean jan doesn't make the decision necessarily but you know as a kind of a unit they've said no like whatever happens happens and we go with that  uh huh   i don't think i don't think  alexa 's quite so sure about that and then i think she's probably pushed for the amnio  sure about that   yeah  there's really no reason for an amnio  is she thirty-five  she's thirty-six yeah   she's thirty-six  and and do they do they  sort of counsel you to have one if you're over thirty-five  as a matter of course  uhh no but they counsel you to th they counsel you in in   the sense that they they say that the option's open to you and they say what are the risks  and they say  yeah  they don't uh definitely don't push you one way or the other  mm hmm  at least they don't you know  they they haven't   yeah  they don't   might be at forty  i think at forty they start to push it more  i know  my brother's had some clients who're  forty and   i think  what they   maybe   mm hmm   the thing is they do the statistics  uh hmm  and the statistics show you what the risks  are  and the risks are staggeringly higher as you  you know for every year you go up  the uh  mm hmm   uh hmm   uh huh   you know the ratios just get smaller and smaller  uh huh   but you know i think that we were prepared uh sort of in the back of our minds that we weren't gonna going to   you know go through life   with a downs syndrome child   with a downs syndrome kid or something  well i don't think that marcie would  no  and and she phoned her mom and said uh you know what do you think  and uh you know she said  forget it  she's the one who has the major responsibility for  name and for this cousin right   forget it   oh yeah oh yeah   yeah  anyway uhm so they'll do that and i hope everything's fine  but you know   cough   yeah   no it's weird though i mean you really do have to be prepared for like what are you gonna going to do  then   yeah and why you're doing it  you've gotta got to say to yourself why am i doing this  because if it if it's only to to   word   to find out the sex laugh   to find out the sex   or if it's to find out the sex then yeah it's not worth the risk  yeah  although i guess if you're if you are  prepared to keep a child that has downs syndrome and you get six months of preparing mentally it may be better  financially  you know   i suppose   i suppose i suppose   that would be good  it's better than finding out on the day of   yeah on the day of   yeah i guess you're right  but still  but still it's like an awful word    but   well it's a heavy thing no matter how you look at it eh  i mean having the power to  help to   yeah it is   and you can't you can't uh  there's no way of answering  you can't uhm   you can't even say what you would do  uh huh  no   cos cos you know   we we were saying what if  what happens whether this or that we were just saying   again they would say er we don't know what we'll would do until we uh until we know  mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  well then  yeah   yeah   you got through that part  oh yeah  well i mean we didn't really expect any  i know any uh strange stuff  no no   but it did i tell you one good thing about the   uhm the place the  you know they call marcie did she tell you  they called her and then they left a message  yeah  and the message said call please call   uh annabelle sampson you know from the montreal childrens'  regarding your ah amnio  mm hmm   mm hmm  and so marcie really thought god it's only been two weeks you know there're some there's something wrong  so she phoned and them and the woman was in a meeting  and uh she said oh okay  yeah i think she said no i mean i really have to speak to her you know can you get her out of the meeting and they did   so i thought that was really  word   mm hmm  and then the woman came and saved the time just to say that everything was fine and uh   mm hmm   i thought it was good that they don't hang you on the  the line there for too long  mm hmm   mm hmm for sure  so it's a boy  well that'll be fun   it's a boy   another boy  did you tell marcelus   is he  yeah yeah first day and once we told him   and he had a cry a big cry said he wanted a girl  ohhh  but uh he would've said that he would've said he wanted a   boy   the opposite yeah yeah   cos he's been saying to name  it's a boy it's a boy  yeah  and now we got the name of word  we had to think of names and marcelus is uh you know  oh oh laugh   coming up with doozies  yeah he's written his different names every so often  mm hmm mm hmm  and it's part of a g   it's it's a game  words   we used to do that with hanny   two or three words   uhm i mean we didn't know who it was but we always used to sort of sit around and think up the silliest names we could you know  yeah ebeneezer and   ma macaroni martin was our favourite laugh   yeah   oh i don't think   you know high humour for children laugh  you don't want to uhm as though you don't   wanna want to commit yourselves  like you don't wanna want to  say to people uhm you know before your baby is born your baby for example you wanna want to   mm hmm   maybe you chose the name jared four months ahead  mm hmm   and you tell everybody  you're not gonna going to go  oh we're gonna going to call him  jared we're gonna going to call him jared  because then the baby starts to be called jared   yes  and uh then when you suddenly think hmm maybe not word   no   no  well i think you know names are funny  i think you you know when you've found a name kind of  like it's funny i mean we were hesitating between two  actually  right up until the end  or i was more than joe   but we didn't tell anybody  everyone asked us what names are you thinking of what names are you thinking of  and we just didn't tell people because they influence your decision  that's right  you know i tape cuts off   le lievre yeah   oh yeah  words my sister   edie edie   yeah  well it's w it is a   a scottish and uh kind of it's a kind of a gaelic catholic name   gaelic name mm hmm   and uh but they did some where kinda  kind of family you know nobody said it was not a nice name but they said edie   mm hmm  and so they called her edie kathryn to   to give her you know as a standby  kind of a name   that's nice   really nice yeah mm hmm   mm  well yeah she alana le lievre  ended up calling her first little boy er henri   henry   oh of course yeah that's right   because because   it was wasn't it didn't   turn out to be a girl   yes but i mean you can pay eighty dollars for a sleeper for a baby for a two-month-old   that's right you can   word oh minimum  that's when it's on sale  mm hmm  have you been over to the pumpkin and egg shop   ah yes yes  that's  i've been in there  we bought an outfit you know this sounds very pompous but we bought him outfits in paris and it cost uh sixty dollars  i mean that was when we were  it was your first baby laugh   that's what it that was  laugh   this was the exact same like at the same  same label and everything and uh  i think it was like a hundred and twenty  in in that shop  mm hmm mm hmm   yeah well my mum went to this place on street name  called jeune d'ici you know that very fancy ladies' shop cos she wanted to buy jared a snowsuit when he was a newborn  oh yeah   oh she did get quite a nice one didn't she   she did  but she was looking around for a long time before she found you know she wanted to find like the perfect snowsuit for her  first grandchild and all of that  but uhm she went into that store and saw one that was for a three-month-old you know a three-month size fits then when they're basically two weeks older that's it right   never again  yeah right yeah   and they look exactly   it was two hundred and sixty dollars   whoah  she couldn't i mean she just was so revolted  she said it wasn't even nice laugh   it wasn't even that great you know   well yeah you know i've been forced to eat my words you know so many times but i remember looking and when  marcelus was born and we saw the little leather biker jacket in the uh window in the as we sit at lunch   you know like two words   mm hmm mm hmm   and uh it was three hundred and fifty dollars or something and i i said to marcie you know  what what kind of unthinkable idiot you know would buy something like this for a one-year-old child and you know  and it's too much money and this and that  mm mm   and then of course we were given one so   laugh you were given the biker jacket  he had to wear it  well at least you didn't take it in and get something else but   no no word   laugh   but nobody else knows that  yeah  well that's i know it's funny  i mean you compromise your principles so many laugh times  laugh   well we got him a new snowsuit this year as you know and and uh it was worth the money  like you you pay  maybe we paid thirty dollars more than the one from  sears or the bay  yeah   mm   and yet and yet it's way better  yeah well as they get older they are a lot tougher on their clothes  you want at least something that's   especially especially   a snow suit  or something that uh  yeah     you wear every day  you wear every day and it they're  on their knees all the time and uh   two or three words   it has to be worn   mm   whispers i know  and do you remember that from   yeah  do you remember that from when you were a kid  you know like getting into your snowsuit after school  and just so you yank the thing and rip the zippers open and slide into it and  and and stepping under   you walk on the the heels uh  you make heels out of the back of the legs too  
Canada	 but uhm it there was no question of panic  we uh we made it eventually  words up  i don't know where the money came to fix the brakes but we somehow managed to scrape it together and made it home in one piece  hmm   do you know something interesting that uhm why we slide into the past like this  uh uh you start out looking at these two photographs all of the sudden we're way way back in the past  it has nothing to do with what we're talking about  marriage abandonment where we are now is because of where we were then  well what are you gonna going to do now  i'd like to say i have a wonderful masterplan but i am waiting for some sorts of inspiration with writing my writing and  well why do you have to have inspiration  i'd like to be tremendously excited about one project i can just throw myself into and the most logical idea for that would be a book being a big project  a book of what  well the book of essays is still a possibility and uhm  words   by what you call my vintage anne-marie   and i thought i had more words together than i do although i haven't precisely counted them up  but chloe said i have to have at least forty thousand  words   how much  at least forty thousand that would be bottom end  uh that's bottom  and uhm well the idea is that uhm because publishing is in such short sorry shape uh that publishers are starting to produce s s will produce smaller books   but seventy is more seventy thousand is more ballpark   so when i started adding up the number of stories i had i got a little taken back  and how many d do  how how many do you have  i i didn't didn't  add it up but it'd be uh twenty or twenty-five that i could put together  as many as that  ya   but didn't you say that that with visual artists once they finish something they're irritated with it  they want to almost push it away and not look at it  ya  and i found that when i was going through some of the stories i felt well yes it's reasonably written and has interest i suppose uhm but i don't like it anymore  i don't like the theme or it seems too melancholy it seems too self-indulgent  you know the the critical voice that starts and so that i i want something fresh that i can begin with  i don't want any a anne-marie   in agony stories  anne-marie in bliss laugh   laugh eke   we're good at bliss laugh   laugh   we do it very well laugh   we just need to write about it  well can't you manufacture it  manufacture bliss  ya  not really  well i mean do you have to be blissful to write about bliss  actually no  i'm word suzie and i had an interesting conversation about that because blissful writing is invariably boring   uhm it's laugh no it's true   laugh   it's like that dreadful radio interview that uh chloe  and i had to go through for c b c and the woman interviewer kept circling back to give us blood give us guts give us how incredibly neurotic you are  and we said we're not neurotic  we have healed  we do love  we are entirely functional loving human beings  and she found that about as interesting as a lemon meringue pie recipe  uhm we had to fight   that was did we tell you about what a disaster that was   no  no  absolute resisting  obviously the interviewer's very capable and articulate and forceful and it was like pushing that rock up the hill  uhm chloe and i were seated across from one another and we kept looking to huh one another for support and resisting resisting resisting this notion that one event or one person or many events and one person had ah irreparably harmed us  we said no and that answer was not accepted  and uhm so we came out of forty-five minutes or perhaps it was even an hour of interview feeling as though we'd run a twenty-five mile marathon  but actually quite pleased with ourselves too because had we felt less conviction about our mental and emotional and spiritual health uh we wouldn't have been as forceful in resisting her ideas  so we felt good about that   well the problem with that you know uhm  let's hope that thing can be laid to rest  you know that that death can be accepted now and you know i mean and quite frankly the the death of  kim has managed to get a fair amount of mileage you know   from the point of view of uh literature  yes   and uh i hope now that uh her spirit can be buried and  not forever but certainly not resurrected in  uh and written about anymore   well i agree  i f i uh certainly have desire to write too much more about that   well this is our first pause in twenty or so minutes  well i was thinking about those those  deaths in the family you know never really fade  you know you can never forgive self and forgive other people that we're not committed to forget  that's the one thing that took me a long long time to understand  cos it for myself anyway forgiveness is mandatory i mean even forgiving myself you know    especially even  specially   but but i'm never permitted to forget  you know   well if i take nothing away from this particular visit it's going to be live one day at a time underscored so heavily again  that's what i'm going to do too  word you know i had a   some difficulty yesterday with anson and  camille talking about that  he really doesn't understand it  uhh i re remember my friend  mendela that beautiful millionaire meatpacker from saskatoon who was so nice to me when i was a young man and i was talking to him one day and i asked him about plans and so forth and he'd be about my age now about seventy and he said you know mister samson we don't worry about the future we just wake up in praise at the   f fact in the morning praising the fact we're still alive  you know  uhm anson just didn't understand that emphasis of that point  i said i behave as if is this is this might be the last day of my life and i try to uhm  word and dry in terms of what i've experiences that  you and try to put some of it into a spiritual system  he simply can't understand the lack of planning for the morrow  he's actually unable to understand  he said but you must have a plan  you you don't uhh exist as if you're   gonna going to die tomorrow  you have some schemes ahead  you must plan what you're gonna going to   read or think otherwise it'd be nihilism  it isn't  it's it's a it's something i  preface you know word   when you're old you have no idea how long you're gonna   going to live and you have to grab onto what you've got   well i think i said to you yesterday too that an ability of his to understand is uhh based to me on spiritual differences  uh what do you mean   uhh   well this stance of one day at time via a a and and   and other influences is a spiritual philosophy because it asks of you to give your very best in each moment  and that moment being the immediate one  ya it's it's spiritual but very  pragmatic too  i mean you have no control over yesterday  that's gone finished  now is all of the the uh implications of what you did yesterday will live on  you have a clue what's gonna going to  happen tomorrow   you really you don't have a clue  you have you hope that certain things will materialize but you do not know  so what are you left with  you're left with today it's exactly what you're left with  and if i do a fairly decent job today if i am around tomorrow to experience it it will make it easier  i know that  but i have a heritage of of discord  to to uh face tomorrow then it's gonna  going to be difficult  so his concerns stemmed from the idea that you're not  really looking after yourself  not planning for the future  i i'm not concerned with the future  i'm only concerned with today  but i'm asking why he was perturbed by that  cough   he couldn't understand it that's all  he wasn't perturbed he just couldn't understand it   you can not perturbe a nihilist you know  laugh laugh   laugh yes yes word    what'd he say   no you can't you can't  i mean he's seen he's an old experienced guy   and he's seen too much and heard too much and s   you know and he's dealing with a bunch of poor bastards at the moment who've gone bankrupt  you know their lives are just shattered you see and he's trying to help em them pull  emselves themselves together so they don't you know do don't be violent to themselves or mess around  you know that in this materialist world when  when you're absolutely hooked in with what you've got that's your importance how much do you make what type of a home do you have what kind of a car do you drive  uh if you don't measure up to to  this myth of uhm how do you call that in swears then you're fuck all you're nothing huh  as you said the other day the masses didn't have an awareness and neither did you in terms of what it is that they don't have the v c rs and the   well they're bombarded with television every single day of their lives  right  anger is one of many reasons why chloe never had the television in the house with rosalyn because the way the advertising is aimed at the kids  you have to have this   i was gonna going to ask you actually about uh uhm the the gig with vin  uhm uhh len 's been practising and he said he'd  he'd be able to play a beatles' song or two if  i mean if they wanted to   oh ya that'd be cool   words you know i thought that would be neat  ya just play some chords  ya well sure or let it be is a nice one  i wouldn't mind doin doing  that i it's pretty straight forward  okay   i like drums in let it be  uhh i think they're light ones but i don't know  but something else we could see  uhm ya i was trying to think of some songs  what was there uhh  there were some other ones i was listening to at any rate  we'll work it out and see what we can do  do you think you could still do great balls of fire like singing-wise  i think i can ya  well  i could w work   re-work-out the chords  ah ohh well laugh you know maybe uh uh   i think my voice has gotten stronger since then mhhm   ya i think it's gotten better  i think i could do it  words- hesitation i don't know if  if you'd want len playing drums there you could see uh but it was kinda kind of nice just you and me  uh that was how you did it originally  well we'll see  ya our first sojourn on stage  puff that was incredible laugh   wasn't that fun  that was  it was like after took me til i got down to the states after the show to realize my god we got a standing ovation  it was like yes  i was up all night  you know what i wish though i wish uhm someone would have taped it  hmm   yaa geez  like you know  ya i know  frozen for well not frozen but  you know   laugh oh well  ahh you know maybe let someone tape the m s society for us  mhh i don't know word i don't  know if we'd be up to par  laugh   really   you don't think we've gotten a wee bit better  ahh   well i don't think well maybe you have   i don't think i have 
Canada	 oh come on technically you've gotten better  and i think you've gotten more uh you got that first taste of stage stuff and you've done some since  you got more relaxed  cos we were scared crapless  the first time we were on the sca stage  we were like i i   was shitting my pants  and and then afterwards to find out that i didn't have my guitar loud enough i was like oh no  laugh   cos vin goes i heard the pick and i was like ahhh dammit you know you were supposed hear the guitar not the pick  laugh   oh well  well we'll see  ya  and uh i guess i should get some some   jazz songs from you or some ideas of what you'd like to do  deep breath   but i don't know how long do you wanna  want to play like  i don't even know like how long do you want us to play  ya i gotta got to find that out if he wants us for like laugh fifteen minutes two songs or if he wants us for like can you play four hours  uhh no  you know but uhm like i'd be willing to do if you wanted to do two sets   if you want to do one jazz and one uh beatles or something  or something just like chords to play  sure ya do some stuff like that  singing  i can play some s chords you sort of well  you play some chords also   do you remember how to play blues stuff like ta-ta ting   oh ya oh oh easy yes i would love that   laugh   maybe we could do something like that  could learn uh old time rock and roll  no huh laugh   but all i ever learned from that was duh duh duh duh duh duh dum duh duh duh duh guitar riff from the song old time rock n' roll  laugh   slike it's like okay where do we go from here laugh   hmm we'll see what we can do  ya   ya uh there were some interesting beatles stuff  i was thinking of sergeant peppers actually  that's a tough song to do you know sergean   sergeant the the kinda kind of   that song   ya  cos len also offered uh see they  they would've they've actually got a band len and a bunch of his friends  oh really  sort of  they they kind of they're working on  feeling how each other plays and playing off of each other and seeing what each other styles are like uh   ya   len 's a very good drummer and actually he's quite an organizer of the band  he really gets me in there  ohh   but uh him and the bassist the bassist is just starting out  he's rayne he lives on your street i believe  the red-haired kid who hangs out with len   he goes to st. word notre-dame  sam dontcha don't you mean  sam then laugh   it's not rayne it's sam   so he doesn't live on your street laugh and he's someone else entirely laugh   no   forget what i said  but uh the red-haired kid  laugh he's uh  with the dyed red hair or   laugh no au naturel   laugh   oh no then i don't know him  uh he's uh well he he started playing bass to kinda kind of be in this band and  he's ah he's a really nice guy and  he's he's a very good bassist actually   hmm   i don't know  i if they could learn it easy then that'd be cool  or if it's not too complicated then uh maybe we could try to incorporate it in  if it's too complex then we'll just say s  sorry only got so much time we can put into it  ya   ya for sure  okay   well i don't think it'll be you know it  it doesn't have to be uh you know a starlie   a sterling performance  yes  laugh like we're at the apollo  yes  mah psh vocalized noise   you should try for ah   like an open blues jam night or something like that   oh it'd be cool you know   it'd be cool but i think we need more  practice words   well ya true but you know they take everybody  and kids who can barely play uh twelve-bar blues to guys who've been playing in ottawa for thirty years  word   are you serious word anyone  sure ya i i've gone to them  geez i played the open jam at uh rasputin's which is a smaller bar on bronson with a friend one night cos we were just there and uh she said she knew the owner and she did this a lot and she said will you play with us and i was like i don't know okay i guess and   and how did that go  it went well  it was a little scary though because w   we we did uh scarborough fair  i figured well that's one i know you know but i couldn't remember the words  laugh so half way through i looked at the audience  laugh can anybody help laugh what the next verse is  somebody kinda kind of yelled out da da da  i said okay laugh but uh but  you know the audience was totally accepting and they  and there were two kids that went up that night too that were like they must have been playing electric guitar for maybe a month month and a half two words  their song and you know they tried and people clapped and  you know   mhhm   how old was this you know i think i've heard of this  ya they have one at the rainbow that's strictly blues and   is is often much more intense cos the band there  the houseband i think they're called what are they called something  zombie or something i don't know weird it's the houseband there they play with you if you want  so you can just go up like one guitarist and go up alone and have the whole band back him  oh wow   so but you don't have to but it's laugh i  it's a little more intimidating cos you got like four professionals backing you you know or whatever it is but  uh  wow   like it's uh i don't know jam it out  i'll learn some jazz you learn some blues  well you got the blues nailed down  words   well i could learn jazz anyways so  it's hard i don't know it's funny uhm  i was reading cos i had that ar   oscar peterson book and in back i was just reading a little bit and it's saying how it's hard for people who are trained classically to play jazz because it's a  it's a different form and all  that stuff and that's why he has like these exercise books  ya   oh really   ahh is it really it's it's   it seems to be i mean there seems to be more uhm i dunno don't know from when i from when i read from when i read in his music like what's written is more straight but when you play it it  you add a bit more uh you know you ad lib more   you two words you know more of a more  uhm   oh i see   mhhm   so it's more like those one of the uh kind of piano solos that were written out in classical music  what like a cadenza  that's it cadenzas laugh   but a real cadenza  hmm  but ya like there's more freedom you know like classical is a bit more rigid whereas you know i guess with the jazz well of course  you know jazz is ya it's more feel   it's more feel ya   it's for your heart and your soul all that sort of stuff  but i don't know i think for me like i mean once you learn a classical style you you're kinda  kind of set in that in that   mode so i think i need a teacher you know  anyway   well your stuff sounds pretty you put feeling into it there   i know but the thing is i want someone to say okay   like i want someone to teach me jazz like a cla   in in a classical two words   laugh i see struction   you know like structure  like this this is such and such a chord and like know what it sounds like and this is a certain riff that you can play rather than you know mumble and fumble through  mhhm   fumble through that through a piece and say  well this sounds like a chord here but might be a jazzy  meat huh   you know   mmm hmm   i don't know how it'd be related to others huh  and what else i'd li   like i'd like to learn is how to read from you know those fake books where they just write the melody lines and the chords   and then you improvise from that  yes laugh   ya that's amazing  you know it's like say  cos i'm sure there's some s some   sort of jazz structure there you know  and once you once you learn those chords down pat  ya   i think so   a few of the chords and probably some of the modes must be popular to use  mmm hmm   i don't know do you find that a particular melody  word or  see i i have no idea what mode i'm using  laugh oh okay oh well you know heh laugh    it's like okay uhm i'm in the key of uh  this uh f and i'm supposed to play uh you know so  laugh   hmm  and i'm sure there there must be some jazz theory you know  i don't think so  hmm we'll have to see  i wanna want to get some jazz c ds out at carleton three or four words learning c d-roms  oh ya   so ah ya  it's like if you uh cos i i know  i don't know a lot of jazz  and   i really haven't listened to it a lot  ya they're doing a word tape cuts out briefly ottawa too  hmm good stuff  you know what they've started doing at carleton did i tell you this i probably did putting the science citation index on one c d-rom  nope you didn't tell me that  they stopped getting the book okay  and the nice thing about getting the volumes in the science citation index was that if you were using like november nineteen ninety-three somebody else could use december nineteen ninety- two or  whatever everybody could use it  ya   they've got the whole thing on one c d-rom on one computer  mhh hmm   well that's stupid   for the whole like this is for  physics chemistry biology geology uh you know  all over it all over   like you know they all use it so laugh  this should be interesting  that's dumb they should do it by you know   two words   well ya i hope they'll network it maybe   ne next in next year's budget or something  but see one thing i found with the computer  is it's when you're trying to do a search  you have only a couple of key words you know  but uhm   yes   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and sometimes the thing is is  that say you have like one key word that's you know quite broad  and it comes out okay two lines you know five hundred uh five hundred volume text  or ya you know like please narrow down your search   mhh hmm   laugh   or two thousand or three thousand ya ya i know   well wha what  and what gets me with that is that is i wish there was a card catalogue at least then you could see the general uhm like the call number like the general area anyway you'd go and you could look at the books and sometimes you don't even know what specifically you're looking for  yes   hmm  you know   well i ya we just got a new system and it will show you  it will show you   i if you have like  two thousand or three thousand entries and you get the time to go through them you can go through them   it'll show you it   ya  oh oh wow whispered   i i the only time it asks you is when you start a search it tells you how many entries and it says if you want this hit return if you don't hit another key just you  have gotta got to say  wow 
Canada	 okay now how many years have i been married   cough   like eight years almost now  okay   okay this house  like i've got a lot of stuff junk like stuff in there i never ever even use  right  one or two words didn't go into the dishwasher  so i'm more into stuff that will go into the dishwasher like these things  my mother for some strange reason decided that i didn't have enough cutlery like forks and knives  i dunno don't know where she gets this idea from  so in niagara falls clears throat new york i think or buff buffalo or e   new york  well it's either over the border but somewhere around niagara falls i mean ontario or or  new york there is an oneida factory outlet  right  my mother and her friend flew to this thing  now god knows why  my mother's got enough junk in that house to suit  yeah to to feed an army with it  spoons and forks and knives  anyways she feeds laugh she buys   a set of twenty-four spoons and forks and knives and  and word   twenty-four   yes like for twenty-four place settings  right  and then she sho and then  plus a whole bunch of other spoons that don't belong to this particular set because she has decided that she and laugh starts  i don't have enough laugh ends   and so she gives me half and and i'm telling her i don't want this  and she's i was there last time and you know   you were you were getting mad at dylan  for using the silver  like he goes into this drawer and he takes out this silver and  then he like clears throat insteada instead of  taking out like his spoons he wants to use all these little spoons and then he just shoves them down the sink  this is why i've been mad at him  not because he was using the silverware okay   i was getting mad at him because he was shoving these little teaspoons down the sink and then that caused you know plumbing problems right  so she gave she gives me this set of twelve  like i don't have what is that thing called where you put all you know it's where you put all your  forks and spoons and knives  like the little organizer that you put in your door   drawer   a few words   i don't have enough room for one of those these things  and if the drawer is just full now with laugh starts forks spoons knives pronounced 'knifes' and things  laugh ends   has she thanked you ah again for her present  uh uh  she didn't you don't think she  liked it  well i think she probably will like it eventually once she gets out of her word state  but have i told you this that she's now consulting uhm two  what do you call it financial advisors   advisors   two of them  not one laugh starts but two laugh ends   i thought that he made her  a a date  he did  he did  he made a date for her with the one guy  yeah  and she went to his office cos she had some problems about him coming to her house  mm hmm  and and uh she liked him   word word   word   she said that yeah he seemed to know what he was talking about  and i said oh mother that's their job they have  you know they get commissions from you when you transfer your r r s ps registered retirement and savings plan  over or whatever   mm hmm   and that he they're helping them buy mutual funds because they have that four or five words and all this crap  a few words   and so then she said yes yes yes and then i said well did you like him  did you get a good feeling from him  did he give you some good solid advice  and she said well clears throat yes yes yes you know i liked him and got a good feeling and he gave me good advice  and i'm going to see him again in two weeks once i get all of my uhm  i forgot one of her all of her  r r s ps registered retirement and savings plan and bonds and stock or i dunno don't know she doesn't have any stock word   she could make a list of them   word word   ya and when they're maturing and what rate she's getting  and all this so that you know she wants him to deal with them and she can start transferring them over so that she doesn't have a penalty on this or stuff   word   and then she's i said oh well that's good and then she said but then you know i'm also going to talk to this wood gundy investment firm man  and i said what for if you if you  feel laugh starts good about this other guy you know why laugh ends   and maybe i just wanna want to you know make sure that i know what i'm doing  so fine two or three words   so she's checking the first guy out  that's right  basically laugh starts a few words  thinking about word laugh ends   a few words he tells her the same  stuff  that's right laugh starts   and the first guy will get all her commission laugh ends   laugh   well that's really shrewd  i just hope that the two corroborate pronounced as a mix between 'co-operate' and 'corroborate' cos then she'll have to go to a third if the second guy a few words the first guy a few words has to go to a third she'll get really confused  oh god really laugh   laugh   yeah i know laugh   but then she'll phone me and she'll tell me whatever the problem is and then i'll give her my laugh starts two cents worth and then  she won't listen to anything i say  so she'll ask another word laugh ends  the same questions and he'll tell her the same thing laugh   and then she'll agree with him and go with whatever you know  she's been told before by him anyway so  i think i word   you're lucky she's working  if sh   oh god she would drive me crazy   if she'd been at home she'd be probably parked on your doorstep all the time  laugh   mm hmm   laugh starts as it is she's buying me cutlery laugh ends   you really   you really are quite lucky   yeah laugh   i know laugh   laugh starts i've got five years to deal with this  laugh ends   then what am i gonna going to do  mm  laugh   i don't know  but then maybe she'll get used to her situation by then  yeah   yeah she probably   well she has a lot of friends though you say  she does and uh she also uhm she you know  she likes going to uhm she likes going  back home and she's got all of her college friends  well  and you know some of them uhm are single now and  their kids are all grown up  and uhm every time she goes back she  you know they word have this reunion  they're always going to one another's houses for tea and dinner and   i know all her friends already and they come here to visit her and stuff like that so   she's she just sort of decided to do the uhm florida thing only over there  like six months of winter over there and six months here  yeah yeah yeah   nah  well it shouldn't be a problem unless she's got  oh yeah actually she might be uh she might be  going to burlington with bill   sigh super  sigh   hmmm  when did she mention that  i don't know  well then how do you know if she's going to burlington with  bill   well i don't know i she i think she   mentioned it or something  i'm not sure  i'm not sure  well what are you gonna going to   do with that place with that bed   well if worse comes to worse i'll rent a car and we'll go  don't make a big deal of it   no i'll ask fayed   i'll ask fayed to take us   no i'll rent i car and we will go  well that's ridiculous to spend thirty bucks to go buy a piece of furniture  that's absolutely out of the question   it's ridiculous  well even if we had asked fanny in the first place  we did   i know   but it doesn't matter even if we had made plans she would have changed them to go to burlington anyways   so   oh   oh you mean she's not reliable in that sense   no she's reliable but she's not gonna going to miss up a chance for a vacation in burlington just to bring us to ikea  oh yeah  i mean think about it tom would you  well if i made a commitment to somebody i would  so you possibly ho your only vacation your only time off to take somebody to ikea for one morning  no i i   would you   no you wouldn't   i know you wouldn't and neither would i  yeah but then i wouldn't promise them   and then   if i wasn't sure then i wouldn't promise the person  but this has just come up  hm   you can't depend on people these days  no you can't   and i you know what i wouldn't even insist on her doing it  if it comes to her having a vacation before bringing us to ikea she needs a vacation more than she needs to stick around here  no i know but you don't you don't say you can do something if you're not sure whether you can do it or not  okay   i know i never do that   i never promise anything  i never say yeah sure anytime anytime you know  i never say that  w'i well i know but that was before she had a chance to go to burlington  anyway i'm going to ask fayed if he can bring us  well  don't ask fayed until we see fanny tonight  anyway she might not be going to burlington cos she may not have any money so  tha that's more irish and french   canadian  it's that dancing and everything uhm   yes  yes yes yes  yeah   and i never learned irish dancing that  my father's side of the family's irish but i never learned  i never learned that  i think scottish country is wonderful  it is it's wonderf wonderful   it it was  it was great  i remember as a child i just loved it  and there was one dance you did called strip  the wheel and it's really fast and  word word  it's fun   yeah   and you could just see how kids would really like it   he teaches two undergraduate courses  mm hmm  and he's and they're two different undergraduate courses uhm one is physics for mathematics and then there's rel uhm quantum mechanics or something anyway  he's nice enough to photocopy his lecture notes and give it to them so that they can follow along as he  as he teaches whatever you know  mm hmm   uh hum   and you know his notes are for himself like he sits here  preparing them and then writes them all out by long hand and  they they went to his office they elected some class president or something who went to his office with a bunch of other committee members or something like student committee members and demanded  that he type up his own notes so that they can have  you know so that they can read them better  now donny's writing is is very good i mean it's it's not it's not at all sloppy  if you look at it it's very decipherable you know  but can you imagine that he's nice enough to give them photocopies of his own personal lecture notes and then they want him to type these notes up  when he told me this i just i said  you're not seriously considering doing that are you  it's a waste all your time   y you know  and he's word   so what did he do  i i think this happened last year  he said well he'd think about it and i don't think he's done anything yet because he hasn't taught last he didn't   he's not teaching this term  well tell them to get one of their own to type them up  mm well yeah that's right  why not  and pay for the photocopies too   sentence   he didn't even ask them to pay for photocopies he did   this from his grant   sentence   i just thought first of all i've bee   i have been to so many university   well that's what this is all about too is that the kids get passed on from you know grade one and two three four five and and they're just getting passed along and people don't  and the parents they don't think a lot like most parents aren't like you  laugh   a lot of parents are too busy  they don't have books at home they don't read to their kids  mm   uhm you know the television's on   and it seems to me that the kids who are the real whizzes with the computers and everything they're just they're just    it's it's getting to be a more and more of a spread i think between you know the kids that are  who have everything and the kids who can't cope 
Canada	 no we can't start tomorrow laugh   laugh   laugh   uh i think the victoria day weekend would be the time   to start   is that multiple words   but i'll have everything already done there  i think we could probably get from here to about here  done on monday but  i'm thinking two or three words   laugh   you're such a good boy   oh that's great   that's fantastic   oh  thank you that's wonderful  because it's straight you know it's  and uh if uh if we are getting that nail gun   well uhm   yeah   well he said that he was gonna   going to lend it to me so uh   two or three words really quickly  yeah  so we can just use that for all the nailing  yeah  and you just go bang bang  bang bang bang  yeah   just like a stapler  yeah  oh boy  yeah  two or three words   like do you watch those uh home improvement things on uh p b s uh television station  yeah  yeah i do from time to time  they put up a whole building in a weekend you know   with those power tools   yeah mm hmm yeah   yes yeah  it's fun watching those  i like watching that programme   so let's   yeah   long audible breath anyway okay  so uh   have   so have you found any pricing on the wood aside from calling dan   no i accepted his word implicitly laugh   ah   i see  sentence   well he's got yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i just  but i imagine that that's sort of you know i don't think that's probably unreasonable  mm hmm  cos he's pretty good within uh   you know cos he's i mean sort of a while since he's done much construction really but he's you know he's pretty good with you know prices and stuff and he seems to   yeah   okay  so   no actually it's true i haven't even  now when you when you get the wood you should specify that you want you don't want  warped wood  okay   you want uh ah nice uh seasoned wood  that uh is not twisted into all kinds of funny shapes   okay cos uhm   that's right cos i'm gonna going to  order it over the phone am i   mm hmm that's right  mmmm   and then whatever finishing pieces we need like mouldings and so on we can probably get at rona hardware store   mm hmm  actually you know what i found downstairs was a piece of baseboard   oh is that baseboard  yeah  i think i've seen that down there  yeah  i don't think we're going to put baseboard a few words   yeah word   i don't think so laugh   laugh   but i thought if we got more i'd   maybe i'd prop it up there against the wall anyway just for old  time's sake   for effect laugh   yeah   well we could put it on  word we don't have to put in on the uh   yeah  yeah i just wanna want to get the wall up and then they get their  privacy and they can have their privacy and they can bring whoever they want in and then i don't have to worry about  them   mm mm hmm   mm hmm   yeah that's right  who's going in there   so uhm so do i have to worry about uh cos there's uhm stuff like you know it's  it's gonna going to have to be built in a little bit right because of the way the uh  the pipes and stuff  oh those pipes   do i have to make word  what's it called a shammy or something  well maybe   is that what it's called  is that the word for that   uhhh a shem or   word   shim   laugh   no a shem is more like just a  thin uh wedge  mm hmm   ah whatever  yeah we should get something to put on the uh  along that beam   ah so ah i guess some more two by four that length   oh the two by four  yeah word word  onto the beam  okay then   and then word put it onto that yeah   oh i see yes okay   alright   that's a good idea  okay so that means that uh we've got fifteen of them here right now  and   okay so   a hundred and twenty one divided by  cos you said that they're about eight feet   they're about eight feet long so eight feet is uh ninety-six inches so you need two more  okay two more  ya   just here  ya  this is the only place right  yeah   it's not gonna going to   be a problem there and it's not gonna going to   be a problem there  i don't think so  okay so seventeen   seventeen two by four equals word    mm hmm   word   what about nails and stuff like that  don't word   nails   yeah you probably want uh uh two inch   oh no we we need some three inch because we're using two by fours along the bottom   uh three inch that bend  you'd better check that dan 's gun will take uh  three inch nails   okay   okay  and you want them that they'll go into cement through wood into cement   and then the rest can probably be two inch nails  okay and they won't have to go through wood into cement  no they're going through wood into wood  mm hmm   and do you still have that wood glue  do you want to do you want to glue the wood as well as nailing it the plywood  just all around this railing down here but uh   do i want to nail the uh glue it on as well as  would that make it would  that make it airtight   as well as nailing it   that will make it stronger   yeah probably  yeah okay   so maybe i should i should   i guess i had some wood glue but i don't suppose that there'd be enough  it doesn't   like that yellow bottle of glue hey   yeah   yeah something like that maybe bigger  cos you just want to put a bead  of glue around and uh  yeah   yeah   yeah   okay yeah  okay   so uh what about uh  it's going to be two inch two inch  plywood right  two by four   half inch   oh half inch plywood   half inch plywood yeah   ya   okay   and uh what about what are we   gonna going to use to seal the uhm the seams  well uhm what i thought we'd do was to put the uprights where the seams are so the big pieces of  wood get nailed to the  uh to the   uprights   yeah   word   right   right  and that'll make it airtight too won't it   ya   yeah   ya   and then uhm ah if you want to if you feel strongly about it they do have kind of flat moulding that you can get to cover the seams  okay   well i just want to make sure it's airtight  mm hmm  and they'll be nailed to the beams on this side won't they  the beams will be behind it  well it it depends   not not necessarily  if you want the possibility of putting up  shelves on the  side   so   so it would be a good idea to keep the beams on this side so that i could actually use it as support for the  shelves   yeah   mm hmm mm hmm   okay  and then the uprights as well you can use   word   yeah   well if i if i'm  making if i'm putting moulding on there it's for the people on the other side  did you   so they're not putting moulding on   obviously   a few words   a few words   it will be airtight though  that's what i'm concerned   but why does it have to be i mean why can't it be open here  word i'd like it   yeah but this is where the garage door is you know   where all the you know  oh right   yeah but i mean it's gonna going to  air moves it's gonna going to  get around  laugh uh well what is there any way   i spose suppose that would be really difficult to do would it  to put in a door  yeah  i don't think that's a good idea there cos then we'd have to extend that wall to the front  but i would like to eventually wall that off you know  is that is that a big   that can be next year's project  laugh   laugh   well maybe dan could help me finish off that part if he uh cos that's a little bit more  complicated to make a door and  stuff   mm hmm mm hmm   yeah it is   to make a door   uh huh   and he could maybe do that  and uh i mean the wall would have to go up  onto that piece of uh you know onto the cement  back there   the cement there   cos if it went down there it would just rot  yeah  yeah  well that wouldn't be too hard to do  i mean that's fairly simple cutting compared to what we're going to do around the stairs   yeah   sentence laugh   laugh   mm mm  uh yes laugh   laugh   but for now let's let's  concentrate on what we have   let's at least get this done yeah  yeah   well okay  well let's see now what else do i have to remember to ask for   they're gonna going to deliver all this stuff aren't they  yeah  yeah  that's right  yeah you should probably have them deliver it to the  garage so that we can just take it right down  to the basement  uh huh   yeah   i remember what i was gonna going to  what i was gonna going to   ask about cos  remember i told you that over here floods  sometimes  yeah   yeah  and i'm concerned about uh   what it is this is where the other uh cement uh shed you  know   things are and this is where the flooding is and it mostly stays along this side but  mm hmm   mm hmm   oh that's right  get some sealer some wood sealer  some wood sealer   yeah  c e l e r laugh   wood sealer laugh   s e a l e r   i like my spelling better  it's more creative  it is isn't it laugh   it's uh more along the line of uhm esperanto isn't it  i don't know  i don't know es   i thought esperanto was more based on spanish  oh i don't know  neither do i  laugh   anyway okay so wood sealer and a nail gun and   word   so my goodness two words   now now ask  dan about the nail gun because he may have to get shells for it  shells  yeah it uses shells  oh   or cartridges or whatever they're called  hmm   it fires the nails into the   hmm   that's why they go into the cement   okay so i'll have to check with you then  to see how thing works  yeah   now we had some renovations done at the office last year as you know  mm hmm  and uh when they put up the walls they used a nail gun    mm hmm  and afterwards we found all these shell casings all over the place and   it was a bit worrying till we realized what they had come   from   laugh   gosh i wonder if that's a few words thinking   i don't know   but it saves so much time   time   yeah  and it's really been in like it'd be in  solid wall right  well yeah  yeah  cos i'm not driving those nails into the cement with a hammer  no  no  how would they do it otherwise without a   without a nail gun what would they do   hmm  two or three words lean it up against a  well uhm   they'd have to find another way of attaching the  the base to the uh floor  word   that'll certainly make it a lot easier  mm hmm  it's a good thing that i found it  mm hmm  yeah  ask him too just in case uh ask him if he has a chalk line  okay   loud breath out i know he has all kinds of stuff and then  you know   yeah  but uh tucked away in his basement or something  cos he doesn't do this kind of stuff very much  anymore   mm hmm   yeah   well and this uh chalk line would be handy cos then  you could put a couple of marks on the  floor so you have the chalk line to   word   yeah   yeah   yeah   yeah i know  all done  then you have a nice straight line  yeah  yeah  hmm   well i'm very excited about this  yeah you want to start tonight  yes i do   laugh   i wanna want to go right down there and start working with those two two by fours that i've got there cos uh   are these gonna going to fit here  oh that totally will  no  laugh oh no two or three words  no  oh     oh well  besides it's kinda kind of  late at night to start hammering things into the main beams that  support the house laugh   word i know it is  yeah right  laugh 
Canada	 all three floors  laugh   well she was hammering away at eleven-thirty one night did i tell you  yeah she was just going to beat the band   really   bam bam bam bam bam   oh   she was really in on a roll  oh okay  and i phoned her up and i said uh   in fact i said that  i said boy you're really on a roll laugh   she said oh is it after eleven o'clock  laugh   sentence   good  they'll see   yeah   well   yeah she's yeah i mean we're not uh tryna trying to spend too much time together or anything but we  we seem to be able to be pleasant to each other without too much difficulty  yeah   good  yeah laugh   it's nice to be able to say that about your neighbours isn't it  that's right  y oh laugh   well my noisy upstairs neighbours are moving out  oh that's good  yes  wow   have they have they been terribly terribly noisy  they've been quite noisy  they've been quite noisy have they   they uh they  played music ah sometimes quite late at night   and the bass comes through so that you think they're actually stamping on the floor but it's only the bass from the stereo  mm   it's it's rather annoying  wow that's awful   so have you had to phone them up in the night   sometimes   no i would tell the landlord downstairs who  tells them to turn it down   mm   so the landlord told me that uh he told them last year when they moved in that it was just for one year and then they're moving from downstairs up to the third  floor   mm hmm   oh i see   oh that's nice  so yeah  so you can look forward to peace and quiet cos they're  probably not   yes they're very quiet  oh isn't that nice  yeah  audible breath in yes well   i guess you uhm win some and you lose some  you got rid of one person and got in somebody that's at least willing to get a few words   yeah   laugh   well sometimes i daydream that   you know that i move above her   oh right laugh   a few words a few words   laugh   he does that all by himself word   laugh   yes he does that actually   i mean when he's he was trying to get your attention tonight he was running up and down the hall and i was thinking you know gee what a good thing they don't live on the third floor   i know   oh well can't do anything  yeah  i mean yeah this is gonna  going to be ready   gee i should get a lot of that done in a day day and a half  laugh   well whaddya what do you have to do for each one   yeah   i mean we nail up these two by fours   we make the chalk-line on the floor   we put down the the two by fours on the floor   that probably won't take a whole day  i spose suppose what'll take a little bit of time is the cutting  the cutting putting up the uprights uhm  making sure the  word   yeah   what're you gonna going to cut on   uhhhm   or were you hoping to have that table down there  like   uhm   what did you do with the table   well i i can't fit it  into into my word space there you know  and i don't know  i haven't talked   a few words   but it wasn't the stuff they make today  is it it's all solid wood eh  it's all solid wood  well you can buy solid wood but you pay a premium  for it   but it's mahogany   i know but this stuff you can't even buy  uh everything is   well mahogany's a really hard wood  it's really difficult too   well not only that but it all has dovetaily uh endings on it  nothing's nothing's glued   or or you know uh or stapled or  is there any actual wood-working to do on it or is it just a question of just mending it  no just the gluing of the chairs  i mean you don't wood-work antiques  no what i'm saying is is like is  is there broken wood   that's what i'm asking  okay   nope nope   sigh   nope  well that's good  word   uh huh   so what do you wanna want to  get a new sofa possibly tape cuts out   c plus  oh that's not bad   finally   i was really disappointed   oh this is uh  my research paper  oh yeah   for what course is this  english  mmm yeah it's not too good actually for english  well thanks  well you're saying you were disappointed and i'm  just   laugh   well yeah but   could've said something supportive   like oh honey it's okay cos you're just beautiful anyways  it doesn't matter if you're smart or not laugh   honey it's okay because you're beautiful and it doesn't matter if you're smart or not   well thank you tomas laugh    word laugh   laugh   a c plus is like average a bit below average  no   bit below average  it's a c plus  it's the first research paper i've ever done   i've never ever done a research paper before   uh  oh well word   i don't care i'm happy with it  it's not that bad   and the comment is good   so   word   so sentence   mm  should we look at uh fabric today  for what  a cover up  oh yeah yeah   i'm getting rid of that thing  yeah  word   it's   yeah   when it comes time to   you gonna going to  roll it up first  no i'm just gonna going to  throw it downstairs  you know how thick that thing is  it's an eight inch mattress  oh   it's eight inches  you don't roll up an eight inch double mattress easily   unless you've got hands the size of tractors and you can laugh  roll it over  mm hmm  but uh  i just want to get rid of it  it's long   getting rid of that mattress was  i should have done it a long time ago  and what i'm gonna going to do is  when i'm gonna going to   take the frame of that bed of that futon just put it downstairs in the locker store it and then when we move into a house then uh i just buy another mattress  mm   mm hmm  word you can get a a  nice thick mattress for a futon mattress for like a hundred dollars  and then we have we have a second bed like uh in a guest room or whatever you know  cos it's a nice frame   mm   a few words nice   it's a word frame  of course it's a nice frame  yeah   it's a very very nice frame  yawn i've got a lot to do still  i've got uh still quite a bit of packing to do  and uh i took i took basically everything off of the uh wall unit so that i can clean them down cos white wall units man every time i move i have to clean 'em  them   why are you cleaning it before we move  because uh   shouldn't you just clean it cos it  aren't they gonna going to get dirty when you move  no  what  no  no this is this is dirt that this is dust that's  settled in cos of the cos of the place is fairly dusty  dust that's that because there's a texture to the uh to the surface   you dust  mm   whenever you dust you dust once a week or whatever twice a week and uhm the dust is a sooty dust  and so it stays on  yeah to a certain extent there's like a little you can see where the books were against the back of the shelf you can see there's a line where it was covered by the books where it's cleaner you know and you know so it looks kinda kind of  stupid  mm hmm   hmm  and it's just not clean  i clean it all the time when i was uh when i was living my in in montreal last  i i cleaned them  i just scrubbed them down scrubbed down all the shelves  hmm  so it just looks nice and clean a few words    when i was unpack unpacking   i packed all my tapes today   packed all my tapes and i packed ah i packed  the paper towel roll and all that stuff   i packed my jewellery box   just like little the little  knick-knacks that could get lost in the scuffle  yeah   so i did that today   didn't do much else  oh then i went to darla's   she made this bean wicked bean salad whooh  did you bring any home with you  no laugh   i want some now  and she had put she had heart of palms in it   word   ahhh   i love heart of palms   i just keeled over   keeler   i actually have some heart of palms here   yeah but they're the uh beaver brand heart of palms eh  yeah   so   i don't like them too much   a few words   you used them in uhm you used them in something though   word beaver  word   yeah  no it was something else in the uh the salad  that we made for robert and myra   yeah well the thi the problem   with beaver heart of palms is that they're big   they're big big big ones  they use big ones i don't know why   they're still edible anyway  well they're edible  they taste the same they're just   nah they taste a little bit different i find  oh  they're not as fine tasting  hmm  uhm do you know what uh what   sandy's having at for dinner on  uhm on friday  probably just like munchies   munchy stuff  oh she's not like making a b dinner like  no no it's not a sit-down big sit-down dinner affair  oh it isn't   there's fifteen people  fifteen people  yeah  oh i thought it was just us and her family  nope   well yeah her family   like trish and her kids   she has three kids   plus matt plus matt 's sister matt 's sister-in-law whoever and us  oh so it's like a buffet type of thing  no it's not a buffet   why does that make you nervous now or  no   it's better  i i don't like sitting   i don't like sitting down at the dinner table with people i don't know  oh i know i know that's why  i don't like that too much  no  but i  no like there's always you know you know there's the first time and then after that it sort of breaks the ice and then after that i feel a bit more comfortable  there's something about eating in front of you know eating with strangers you know people you don't know  mm hmm   it kind of sounds anti-social but  laugh   laugh   a few words word    like the first time i ate the first time i ate at your parent's place i i  felt nervous  why  i don't know why  i don't know why  it's just something that i've always felt nervous eating with  strange strangers   oh yeah   eating with people i don't know  well you'll get used to it after a few meals laugh  shovel it all in  like the rest of us do laugh   will i   laugh   real country eating yeah  yup drawled 'yeah-urp'   laugh   pass us the mashed potatoes pronounced 'potaters'  laugh   laugh   a few words in a 'country' brogue    laugh   laugh   laugh ah ah ah  word yawn   well is your brother doing anything   two words   pardon me   no not really  i'm going to go there on sunday i guess   my brother's supposed to be there  yeah   i'm not gonna going to   get my brother's uh son to help us move because you're gonna  going to be there so  alright   i can do it i mean  yeah i'm going in the morning i can  but you should be able to have everything moved by  by eleven right   it's just th   yeah  well   if you start at eight   yeah   if we start at eight i figure two words  probably around twelve  okay well i word   cos it's just lots of bags  i i can see myself in a situation where like uh you know there's one move left but if i have to go to work i'll just have to go to work  well that's why i'm gonna going to  uh do all the big things first   first   and the boxes and then the garbage bags like i can do  yeah   i can do uh you know the rest of those anyways  tammy i could ask tammy to just come   back and word   is everything okay with tammy for uhm  tomorrow  i dunno don't know i haven't spoken with her  did did does she know about it  i don't remember  oh god   oh  i don't remember   she suggested it  well you didn't actually confirm it with her  but i don't remember   well i probably asked her but i don't remember   i don't remember   is she going to be home tonight  ya   actually she should be home very soon  good   i'll ask her   so it shouldn't be a problem  not tomorrow saturday 
Canada	 yes   yeah   so you can try it like that  if you're you flung it around it would be great  if you're not happy   yeah if you got all that tape cuts out   word tape  there is a timeline limit of twenty minutes right  so   yes   yeah so it doesn't really matter   but so  yeah it's whatever we do  and then one of the things i was going to ask  two words is this thing that came home about the  name school for performance  word i didn't get one of those  your son already takes piano lessons so maybe they  word   yeah yeah   um see it's about aptitude and the measure of a child's aptitude to be involved in some musical programme  mm hmm  now i was thinking about it for alice cos  jonathon is really resistant  laugh   i mean he's just not interested   phrase   he even hides the fact that he likes to dance  really  oh yeah  well   and he's got this odd notion that it that it's  feminine too feminine and boys don't do it   oh but he's done some of the dancing for proper name on the stage  yeah that stopped  i think if they catered it more uhm   yeah two to three words   phrase   ah so  but i was thinking about this for alice and i'm not sure  performing arts uhm   word   it's about finding out if the child has musical or artistic interests or abilities  but of course it's not about visual art   uhm so it's about music instruments but they have drama as well  oooh  well i know she's an actress  yeah but your kids are really good with uhm the visual arts word   actually they are  alice 's things are really nice aren't they  yeah yeah   we've got a lot of it at home   phrase   phrase   well she did it through the daycare yeah wow  look at that she did that  it's turned sideways but she did that  wow  that's very mature   but that colour   yes   the colour word     that's a lovely word   it is it is  oh and this one  that was like a trilogy of things she did  yeah  look at that big face  yeah  so   uhm at school or at daycare those  word   daycare i think  isn't that one nice  yeah   she is a two words    i think she did this  well wait a minute  maybe she did those ones at school  uh huh  uhm but she does nice things two words  too  she did that at school  yeah  i think that's really nice   she's really good isn't she   she does   she has a nice sense of uhm of  col uhm   yeah   she's loose with colour and warmth   ya     jonathon is much more into drawing ah  than paint    he's not painterly   uh huh   no   uhm and so like he did these two of the flamingo  yeah  yes it's ah that's more detailed  and they get smaller and more specific  yeah  yeah   yeah   a ha   this is a pretty colour  what is it  that tea  that's that six herb tea  yeah   oh is it really   no no no i think you had it here before  yes charlie takes it to work every day now   they they finally  have it at uhm herb and spice  they've got some in  so but i was thinking in terms of the music   i think alice is very musical  she always listened to music  she's always been singing songs  mm hmm   uh hmm   she makes up little songs about everything and uhm  uh hmm   but you never know   i kinda kind of   we have that piano  mmm  just by accident   i never would have signed him up for lessons   but again he he   went   yeah  he not too bad   never would have thought  never in a million years  right  laugh laugh   so   uhm   out of the blue laugh   so i think i'm word   cept except he's quitting  laugh   he's quitting   why   well he hates that teacher  he can't he can't stand the  the teacher   she's eastern european and very strict and he's working for the grade one royal conservatory exam  and it just has to be absolutely perfect  and a few words   mm hmm   laugh   yeah  he's not a perfectionist  no  so uh next year he's in the french fifty-fifty   we'll stop the piano and we'll debate go for music or going to jen johnson for more relaxed piano lessons   and yeah after that i'll talk to jen and  get two words   oh yeah i see  it's just the teacher  the other teacher was much more relaxed and pleasant and  he enjoyed it more  the teacher means everything  yeah  she's a good teacher oh she's good  he he has to get it exactly his timing and everything has to be and it's rea   it comes out really nicely   but he hates it  he doesn't wanna want to do it  if you could teach them the fine line between the pleasure the child has to take and   loads of pressure loads of word    yeah   yeah that's right   because i know i used to react negatively to too much pressure to do something perfectly  exactly yeah   because sometimes doing it perfectly according to the rule means that you're not being very  you don't feel like you're expressing yourself   right word word    and so there has to be a fine line there   too   and you have to watch too rigidly for the  technique  all of those things you have to instead of just quietly enjoying it you're thinking and counting and watching  the  phrasing   yeah   word   unfortunately you have to have technique because  if you don't have technique it won't look easy when you do it  yeah yeah   laugh   laugh   well a few words   people do  that's what yeah the fantasy is that you sit down  and suddenly you know chopin   just flows through your fingers and into the piano and out it comes and of course it's never like that  word   boom   yeah sigh   but i i  </} used to feel that way with dancing because the kind of dancing i did was highland dancing and it was very rigid and it was very exact and absolutely precise   oh yes i bet   yes   every motion every movement had to be precise as such  yeah  and i was i was quite good  but i could never practise hard enough to do the technique perfectly  because i preferred performing  yeah  i i loved performing   and so i always had you know very appreciative audiences  but i hated competitive dancing  i think you were really just judged on on  technique   and that's right yeah   and so i would i would place   i would do okay but i was never a champion i  think because i had no desire to  be   yeah   yeah   yes yeah   and because it seemed to me that there was something wrong about being competitive about something that i had such an emotional investment in   because surely if you love to perform  it should just come through  and that should be what it is  mm hmm   yes   that's right   yeah  so i think a different attitude drives it   phrase   yeah   it's really tricky uhm  yeah  we were just talking about that cos lenny's friend entered one of his own pieces in the competition the kiwanis  community organization competition  but there were three kids in his category and he came in third   mm   and i was talking to his mom about it how she felt about that  it was interesting  she said well i thought his piece was much more creative but his  technique was nowhere  nobody obviously had coached him and the w   girl who won her technique was just perfect   very difficult and her tech technique  was was   word   oooh  who was this   oh yes yes yes it's very good   th the bright one  yeah  yeah  two to three words very interesting but  well i don't think so   yeah   it's always   words he talks like a  word   yeah laugh   a few words   he has no imagination  well that's the problem  he has no imagination  i'm very boring  laugh   exactly  and callum wants to you know play with  jonathon all the time and and jilly  would like daryn to come over too and play but they just don't play   and so serious in so many different respects kind of  it's as if they don't know how to play  he doesn't really  no  oh   she says he does but i haven't seen him  i had a ton of your stuff out for the little girl   for their little girl   and she just loves it  she and alice would do well together  oh really  how old is she   she two words   uhm four  she's in junior  she went over the day that i had alice in  the garden   mm hmm   and so she had all the stuff out and set it all up and was talking away making this little play and then alice  came over later in the day and took over from the same spot  almost the same little play chatting away and then  alice has a hosil hospital with a  buffalo in it   oooh   laugh a few words   a few words   laugh   sentence   yeah yeah  they chat away and it's very imaginative  and you love to listen   mm hmm   and poor old benny 's reading his adult books  he's so serious  and he's very intelligent  but there   he's got the  rest of his life to do that though  mm hmm   he's gonna going to do that   laugh   well no well no   his intelligence will be a burden but he'll never know it  h he'll they'll put him in  two or three words so at least he'll have some challenge there  then he'll go off and earn mutiple degrees in something or other  she doesn't think she wants him to be a concert pianist  anyway  maybe he should decide  yeah he's got in he's flown   four times in the kiwanis  he's played once  three more times  and we'll see how he does in   he could dance in the kiwanis  really   he could place there too  yeah well   yeah yeah they have all kinds of   phrase   it's good to be involved in those  things   yeah   well i got my first trip to europe because  of because of well we toured  europe and went to paris and all those places and it was wonderful  i know   great   uh huh   uhm   we had a grant actually through somehow with the canada culture  like canadian culture   it wasn't the canada council  it was something  uhm and we did fundraising  and it was it was a wonderful experience that uh yeah word   and how old were you  ah sixteen by then   that's old   i started when i was four  i finished dancing when i was eighteen  sixteen   you kept going  oh yes   word   i have a teacher's certificate  yeah but i mean scottish country dancing  no i don't do it here  i i could  join join a scottish club or something  why haven't you   but parents are heavy heavy into it   i know   oh i'd do it but they don't know the   school i was in   word   you should find a group here it's much better here in ottawa  maybe it is  scottish country yes  it's here one or two words   two words churchill  i feel odd because i don't feel very scottish anymore  i did more as a child because i grew up in that culture  you know   phrase   phrase   phrase so my grandparents are  oh really   my grandparents lived with us  my aunt and uncle were on the next street  i have   your mother came straight over  yes when she was twenty  she was born in glasgow  a few words   oh   she was raised there   oh   so my mother still has an accent  uhm i had a scottish accent when i was little because i was surrounded by this  yeah yeah   my grandfather was the president of burns club  we had scottish people coming all the time  my uncle was the president of the other scottish club  name of club   every second saturday they'd have country dancing   so we did that as well as the highland dancing  ah huh  so   it's a lot of fun one or two words    even thomas is scottish so  uhm   does he did country dancing   yeah he does know a little bit of it but he doesn't like to dance  he's all self-conscious and everything and word    oh that's too bad   but the only time we've ever done it   is once we visited friends of his this was years and years ago in england in a little uhm village  near uhm called chilbolton  i think it was called uhm and it was not far from uh salisbury  and ah they had a barn dance   uh huh   uh huh   uh huh   and english barn dances are really similar to  scottish country dancing  it's line dancing but it's not  it's not that north american swing your partner  stuff kinda kind of  thing but it's like that   yeah word   jigs   yeah 
Canada	 it wasn't glue it was wax laugh isn't it  well yes but wax is a glue  yes alright   so when did you get the idea to do this  uhh when i was at the national gallery  when i looked over that uhhm balcony in the atrium there  and directly below me was a circular table with four chairs nicely designed  and i thought god i thought beautiful to  sp have a b body splayed out down there  uhh be about twenty feet i suppose  i guess that the im image   i find the image i particularly appealing and haunting    how did the black clothes look on the grey floor yesterday  yaaa i didn't think very much about the colour  no  no it's the film it's the film that    cos the colour plays such a i think important role in this one with the dandelions doesn't it  ehmm   ya ya ya it's interesting though the dandelions are  are featured in your wreath  hmm  and she reminds me of a greek maiden now that  an innocent greek maiden and uh she's not a tender person you know and at this stage very outgoing very aggressive and   but here all that vulnerability shows  ya it does  absolutely   hmm they are quite similar really when you look at them  ya they're ya ya   the greens and i think the colour's a little bit more vibrant and more maybe they're using different film  what do you think about rockney by the way  well everybody seemed to be dismayed that it was overgrown  uhm i presume because you've gone to it for years and seen it  lovingly cared for and manicured but i don't think i've been there before so it didn't bother me to see it uh grown over  but it was uhm untidy  but it was a lovely place and uh  i dislike it  why is that  well i grew up you know i was born less than half a mile from that rockery and into that sort of upper-middle-class environment surrounded by wealth and  you know sixty years later i returned to that place to look at it  and it reminds me of  you know i live very much in the present but on the other hand i'm forced back into the past sometimes when i go see that district  yes   oh look there's a child uhh i look there's a child and i  walk there and in the seats and i walk there a certain amount of happiness and all that was destroyed uhh in nineteen twenty-nine  so it's not an easy sort of saunter for me  it's a it's an unkinds  sported back in time and i don't really like that because i live very much today   so i don't like to go back in time unless i choose to do so myself  choose with a small c  do you think then about what sort of person you  would have been had the circumstances had  had stayed the same   cough   no absolutely not  no i don't two words things   it was about you know all the unhappiness came  which came after that period after words  that environment  didn't you say that that park was where johnny  had taken his tumble on the toboggan or was that a different  near that ya ya ya  well that was you know that's another generation after that you know   another life   ya another life another generation  ya must be strange for you word eh photograph a sister who is you know twenty-three years younger than you are  well it's always it was strangest   in the very very beginning when she was littler  but uh i i was glad yesterday when i went to the school and they said hey you look like joanne's sister  i enjoyed that  but uhm  what do you feel like having cough two sisters who are so much two half-sisters who are so much younger than you   well number one i've never stressed the half  part and you know that  it just strikes me as something that doesn't need to be stressed but of course how i feel about it is not a straightforward  sort of situation  i'm very grateful that we all get along  that uh their personalities are you know mesh with mine   and uh the bottom line for me has always been how much joy they bring into your life  so i would like them if only for that  uhm hum uhm hum uhm hum how do you feel about the separation  and and uh pending divorce  again that's very complex and words    well ya i know it's complex but you know come on how do you feel about it  there's no one sentence answer is what i'm saying   no but you've got words  you've got words of time  uhm i have a lot conflicting feelings about it  i obviously wish it wasn't happening  uhm i hope that we can all come through it with affection and strong ties  you know i'm not particularly concerned about that as far as uh my sisters are concerned  i'm a little more concerned about how it will affect you  but i feel a lot better after i guess the conversation the other morning uhm where you stressed you are living one day at a time and you do feel optimistic about the future and when the time is appropriate you'll consider new adventures but for this moment you're just uhm taking it a day at a time  phrase   yes i am  why  well i suppose it's the business of vows  laugh come on anne-marie   it's true there's uh the in sickness and in health  part there's the till death un   unless why bother being married  and that there are many choices to how you can be in a relationship  there's the common-law situations there's the more casual situations and there's marriage  and uhm the essential idea of marriage is a life-long commitment  so i i mean it's hard not to use melodramatic words like uhm like vows  and honour and uh that sort of thing but i appreciate that it wouldn't do anyone any good for you all to stay together if there's uh essential unhappiness  don't you understand her position at all  oh sure i'm very good at putting myself in other people's shoes  absolutely  but it's a i guess it's a question of the newness  getting getting used to uh the new parameters  no the you know words i just remember things  it's uh also a social contract  and if uh both parties agree you can uh you can break that contract  and where society's set up in a certain way and uh we have agreed we have laws which say if that contract becomes inoperable we can dissolve the contract according to certain rules and regulations and procedures  and uh it isn't for life it used to be for life and   word   why has it changed  well it's a very simple reason marriage was a sacrament ordained by god  i mean that is what uh why  marriage was uh you could not dissolve marriage   it was based upon a uh sacrament which could not be altered  you couldn't you can't change a sacrament  it was an absolute  we no longer believe that  and uh well uh i i'll tell you something interesting  i'm not angry  i beg your pardon that's not quite true  i'm angry at the way it was done but i'm not angry at the  the act itself okay  uhm i don't care  i care for the fact that the the family unit as we know it will no longer exist okay   but i'm not particularly surprised about it nor am i  the only thing i worry about is my health  i'll be absolutely honest  will my health at seventy years of age be okay so that i can discharge my responsibility with the kids  and that's the only normal i mean you know i am a poor man but i'm not worried about money   i'm simply not worried about it  i'm not trying to  can i provide an uh physically and psychologically and spiritually an environment where those kids will  thrive   and that's what my responsibility is  nothing else  well i guess i was when steve was over the other day uh he mentioned that his parents were having their fiftieth anniversary and i thought how unusual that was and i think i said something to you later about well heck the only people in our family that are gonna going to get to the twenty-five are gonna going to be chloe  and arnie   and uh well perhaps i should remember i don't see any trouble on the horizon for tom and sammy as well  but it is unusual to have that sort of uh length of marriage  it shakes up my ideas of of what people are capable of too to have your marriage again melodramatic terms fail  i mean it doesn't fail at all it changes uhm but i suppose i have conflicting feeling about that as well  i don't know if people can go a lifetime   it's a clash of romantic notions with more practical notions  particularly with the stresses that uh people face in this  time  well you know i'm word of things  cough which i've seen   i've seen over and over and over again and this may be having something to do with times in which we live where the one partner for whatever reason outlives the other  uhh there's a guy i know at word who's a full professor there and his wife put him through school for years and she was a secretary and uh he got his b a and his m a and his p h d and started publishing nationally and internationally and he outgrew his wife  cough she was still a little secretary you know pounding away on her word processing machine  suddenly couldn't communicate anymore   and i've seen the same thing with women uhh   i mean women who overcame a you know a  skilled position   and her husband was a carpenter   and he couldn't keep up with her anymore and she's wanted it out and she got out hmm  and it's not too dissimilar to the relationship i had with  kim   she's a very sophisticated woman living in in   in an expanding world and my world is contracting   so you know that part i understand too  that's quite apart from the physical aspects  but when you talk about outgrowing someone you're  it seems to me that you're mostly talking about intellect and world experience  there's much more to healthy relationships than just the sharing of ideas and the growing of the intellect  i it things  that keep us closest to someone often have little to do with those things i think  na you're ah you're talking about sex  uhh yes but more the feeling of being home when you're with a particular person  word see one of the things about  word feeling of relationships is that if you have a strong sexual bond you wis you can automatically resolve certain problems through sexuality  you reach a crisis ah you rejoin sexually and you start again and that's the essence of certain kinds of relationships  it's a very healing thing  it's a delight and it's a healing thing  we don't have that   as she coughs and chokes and sputters laugh   this is her father she's talking to  laugh ya   ya that doesn't actually surprise me i mean ah   it fifteen years is a long time to be with somebody and uhm  i remember kim saying to me when i separated from joe  oh you've got the seven year itch  uhm which in a very small way was true and that was more an entire crisis of identity in and uhm a terror of the emotional blandness that had crept into my relationship with him  but that's something i struggle with too i suppose the idea that infidelity does happen and how do you get beyond that i don't know  uhm how do you keep that feeling to one person physically at work for a long time i don't know  but it can't it can't be that it's not the it can't be the centre of it all 
Canada	 it really can't  laugh it can't be the centre but you're right that  you can't have  well i have a girlfriend who is always telling me i have to make up a list you see if you don't make up a list of exactly what you want then you can't expect to find exactly what you want  and i was laughing with chloe about this because i had i was allowed ten points you see on my list  and i and uhm wonderful sexual relations happened to come up number eight on the list  and of course we had a good chuckle because it showed changing priorities  and i was actually i laughed when i saw it at number eight too  but uhm ya of course it's very very important but uhm being able to communicate and having shared values and shared goals and all those other things are very important as well  you know one amazing things is that uh after that after chloe's book uh smouldering rock  came out uh with all the family secrets and uh and uh traumas of the old days and her uncle's case and her father's case and her grandmother's case and uh family's are still  incredibly involved with secrets and you will never know the secrets  of my life with kim never  nor would i want to  why not you'll words   laugh well laugh   everything is always grist for the writer's mill   laugh   come on you're a writer   laugh okay yes well i suppose  so this book i told you about uhm about this journalist friend i have in b c british columbia   cough   i think he ah as i explained to you was adopted and  and found the roots of his family  there was one line in the book that has stayed with me  it just resonated  it was towards the end he had found his family had established ah some good ties with some siblings et cetera and uh some tragedies  came not long after his uh finding a family and the sentence that really rang for me was he said i've discovered that finding family ultimately means losing the family   and it was an aspect that you hadn't thought about when you first picked up the book  you just though of here's someone's dream coming true finding his true-blood siblings his ah his uh blood  parents and he did  and in some cases the scenarios worked out well and others not so well but his joy was almost immediately snatched by uh some tragedies  and it made me wonder what sort of victory that was for him  i mean it it's a regular victory  he's experiencing now what everyone else would if they were close to their families  uh tragedies do happen  he lost a nephew was basically what happened uh from suicide  uh but then he was at that point starting to become close to the sister so was able to give her comfort and uh   but it the line really stayed with me  well it cough it's  probably got to do with this whole business of  of the newness of of  perfection that surrounds families  anyways  the waltons  well they're supposed to be uh parents are supposed to be just and kind and truthful honest and  unselfish and and forever the same  they're not  george bernard shaw said well love is a words  laugh words his parents   laugh   and uhh you can't have that  and and in in  families that they exist i think with most children they word in their lifetime the lifetime of the parents anyway that disappointment that their parents weren't better then they were more understanding more loving more unselfish  and uhh that's the name of the game  you know we're we are we are   not saints we're only human  and uh which you know the the man who who rediscovered his his long-lost parents you know has   they're not ideal they're just ordinary human beings you know fallible bungled beings like the other human being but you don't expect that  i know in fact he was quite horrified by uhm some of the  attitudes he heard his mother express and he tried to be fair in that assessment considering her environment and upbringing and so forth  but he hoped for more of a sympatico exchange which didn't happen  well maybe you know i think the reason why i you and i are able to communicate is the fact that cough as well as we do is the fact that for the last twenty-five years we shared the best of each other through correspondence and through occasional visits and very little of the ugly very little of the nasty very little of the temper very little of the rage  i haven't seen it in you and you haven't seen very much of it in me so we're able to perpetuate that myth  that's very nice for me you know   laugh   anne-marie is sweetness and light and maxwell is  the rising and respected father of the world  that's right that's right you've got it that's right that's right  ya you don't uh you don't have many of those uh failings that uh parents are so frightened of in  in perceiving in their children mhhm  that's nice to know that's your perception laugh    laugh that's right that's right  you know you're always happy you're always joyous you always like to laugh and uh i don't see you in despair  that's fine with me laugh   come on anne come on come on  only my dog does  only my dog knows for sure laugh   you know i i wonder though you you're it seems as though you're presenting the idea that  our closeness or enjoyment at one another's company is somewhat based on the fact we haven't seen the uglier or sadder or more difficult times  i wonder how things would be different if we had been able to support and uh be there for one another during those times  it would be a a different sort of  ahh fabric  well i mean that's that's one of the big things which you know is unresolved in your uh emotional life  uh that is the i was gonna going to  say sense but the conviction that you were abandoned you were abandoned by your father abandoned by your older sister  you were even abandoned by your sister who was so malicious and who died  uhm eventually abandoned by your brother laugh   laugh ya i was gonna  going to say don't forget johnny   laugh the bastard moved not just a province away but a country away  and he knows you said that i i  couldn't help thinking of the time uh his mother kicked him out  laugh when he was fourteen years of age and he landed in salt spring  and he went to salt spring   he landed with me and i decided to uh cough help instruct him  but there was this strange guy who'd suffered a broken neck and lived in the cabin beside me and he had studied m   marine biology at some american university and he was   a a dope-smokin' hippy you know until he recovered from the broken neck  and uh uhh i decided that johnny had to learn about   my marine biology with this guy   laugh   get him up at four o'clock in the morning and he'd go down and lay laugh word the marine life was at the rocky edges of salt spring island you know off the georgia straits  laugh   oh god poor johnny   isn't it terrible  i can't see it being a terrible thing  besides they were probably enjoying themselves having the odd puff or two  yes ya  i'd go to vancouver and do my writing for the week and i'd come back with loaded down with groceries laugh  and that kid you know just left me on that island laugh by himself  what did you do  i don't know  laugh he probably read  he had a girl he had a girl so  at fourteen  well not not that that's particularly surprising laugh it's just it wasn't his home turf right  you know he had a girl one of those girls who had long hair and long diaphanous skirts you know who's word    oh ya the kind of words standing from the summer laugh   that's right that's right  lady word   and uh don't know where she came from  but he found her you know   mhhm he really did  yes  and uh i always remember the clam chowder a big cup  of   i remember you making that  it's word   it was > really good although i didn't uhm quite have a word taste for seafood at that time but i remember watching you make it  and the house smelled tangy with tomatoes and onions and celery  do you remember that cottage  yes i do yes i do  i remember the enclosed veranda the screened  veranda and uhh i remember the the   there's a step down to the kitchen  oh gosh you know what i'm getting confused with uhm the cabin at rosso  uhm was there a step down to the kitchen no okay then i am getting confused  but i remember the veranda very clearly and that it was up a little bit on a hillside and word it was very cool so there mu must it must have been it was surrounded by the trees quite heavily and  laugh   what  no na word a bit lazy there  you had this uh this huge fireplace which i burnt out by the way and just built the fire so high that it  ruined the fire-brick but i had some ex american marine  middle-aged guy who used to cut wood for me  and burnt eight cords of wood in that goddamn fireplace in the wintertime eight cords  cheap wood too  big strong guy  i think he used to build uh ya he used to build airstrips on laugh pacific islands you know   words   words   ya ya  how long did johnny stay over there with you   there's not enough for me to write  cough i can't remember not very long   hmmh   he got bushed  laugh   i'm very relaxed actually  i don't consider it you know he dropped out of school and all that sort of business   and uh that's where i taught him how to drive  that's what i recall  you had some bit of a car didn't you  i had a nineteen fifty-seven deluxe four-door   pontiac two-  tone   ya   uhh but woo laugh   power this and power that   yaa it was registered to some mythical guy who'd long since disappeared and it was insured with him but the ownership was very shaky i remember that  it came to me because uh gerry fister took off to england and left the car there and gave it to me and well what a beautiful built car  it had four speakers in it  can you imagine a fifty-seven car  whoa  he put it in the ditch johnny put it in the ditch  uhh but i taught him how to drive   cough ya i say good teacher   laugh   he did that by himself   words laugh   ya ya ya > ya  and he ended up being a good teacher   he lent me that big boat that he had the biscayne  and that was one of the first years he went tree-planting  and when he came back he said uh what are these dings doing on here  i said what dings  i said those were there laugh before you left  and he said no no i'll show you the ones that were there before i left and of course they had the rust patches and so forth and words  mine had rust patches so i had to say oh well perhaps that is new  but that was a fun car  we had we lost the brakes one time when he and i uh went camping with alex and ron   we went up to   with who  alex and ron   yes  and we took a camping trip up to nelson and uhm  who who is ron   ron michealson   oh yes  and uh so the four of us loaded all our gear into that big car and on the way coming home there's i can't remember if it's coming in to nelson or leaving nelson there's   an an enormous hill and uh we basically lost the brakes 
Canada	" listen you just buy the stuff and i'll decorate okay  laugh oh ya sure i spend the bucks  you enjoy it   laugh   that's right dear  now we both enjoy it  laugh   laugh   i'm sharing  that's what you call sharing  uh huh  laugh   what's the spanish hall chair look like  spanish it looks like a spanish chair   laugh   i don't know why i bothered asking you should   it's dark it's dark dark wood  like uhm well darker i think it's cherry  it's cherry wood ya cos it's like a red and  but not red-red it's like a mahogany dark like brownish red   now ah may i be so uh ignorant as to ask

closer look at it to really   i mean if she's going to give it to us uh  well of course  ya  she doesn't want it  but anyway there's no room for that right now  ya cos once it's fixed up it's going to be  oh it needs it needs repair  well my my dad just did the uhm he just sanded the the top of it   last year and we uh varnished it and everything   uhhn   we finished it and just the chairs the

think i sing better than you do  no  oh yes  oh no  yes  oh no   yes   uh-un  no i'm sorry i don't think i sing better than you do but i think i have a better voice than you do   that's different  no  yup  no   well you have a better speaking voice ya  no not necassarily a better speaking voice  ya you have a better speaking voice  you're more clearer but that's because you were in communications and stuff like that  it doesn't have anything to do with communications  sure it does  no  oh come on when you know you're being recorded and you're on the air you don't talk differently  i do when i'm on that s  that hand radio thing  oh i see   hand radio  or ham  laugh laugh   laugh   easter ham radio laugh   laugh hand radio   smoked ham radio   it's like when i was a kid i used to call this my  thingger laugh   what   my thingger   laugh   your your finger and your thumb   laugh   laugh my word   laugh that's funny  ya  this is funny ha  haaa i have to go and pick a bath mat and then i have to buy some  word soups and then i have to buy a baguette  like a baguette  baguette laugh   you sound like some kind of swamp frog  baguette baguette  don't you know those frogs that sounds like they sound like when you hear a tin can it's half full of water with a lock  bahuuu bahuuu  mhhm   that's what i used to think   you do that well huberto   that's what i used to think when i was young eh  laugh   i'd think it was somebody throwing  hitting hitting a can with a rock   a can of water bahuuu   oh ya   god  it's nice you know i used to wonder  wha how how do you do that how do you produce that sound bahuuu bahuuu bahuuu    laugh laugh laugh  oh god   it's true bahuuu bahuuu   ya ya ya anyways so my fortune teller's sound of coin hitting the ground see why do you interrupt me   i just dropped some money  ya no i wouldn't interrupt you   anyways we're going to be very happy together as long as i don't lose my temper so quickly  she said because i'm very changeable my temperament is very changeable  it's volatile  and i can fly off the handle for no reason whatsoever  ya but i've never seen you really really   give your observations on that photograph that you took  and then you can give the observations on the one i took of you  alright let's start with amanda then  do you want me to start  yes   i think it's an incredibly beautiful photograph of a  girl just on the threshold of womanhood sitting in a   a strange overgrown rock garden wearing a   a wreath of dandelions and she's so innocent and so beautiful and so unfolding  and what i'm going to do with this is i'm going to get an eight by ten blown up and use it and write a little story about it for   that this little half-book that i'm working on  right right does she remind you a lot of chloe there  no not in the least absolutely  i know she's more impor  important> i don't know really she's she   doesn't resemble any other family member that i know   she doesn't resemble chloe in the least   i always thought she did  so what do you think of my photograph word  i love it that's why i'm getting the triptych made and uhm it's it's gonna going to   look great  and uhh i still like the idea that it looks as though i'm falling  that i haven't hit the ground  i don't quite know why that optical illusion happens but it does although it took me a day to to see that  that uh that's i suppose is a little bit of a disturbing image the idea of still falling  but the body language in the photo i've i   look very relaxed i think  words i just mention that uh in fact i showed it to the psychoanalyst yesterday that photograph and said  that i didn't have the technical skills to photograph myself lying face down in a field of dandelions and cut grass   but i should point the fact that it's it's   symbolic it's myself   it's what it is it's the fall of icarus flying too close to the sun and becoming unglued and   and that's my life   i tried to fly too close to the sun and became unglued   came unglued laugh laugh    ya that's it you read it you read it "
Canada	 ya it's where the uh the faucet is coming out now its been all boarded up and stuff  mhhm   yup  mhh  hhm so how are your plans for the garage coming along  well well we have lots of estimates lots and lots of estimates  i see  alton is uh really he wants to be very sure about what we're doing  okay   ya  so i have been the go you know   anson's been doing my negotiating for me actuallyx   ya   he's been he's the one you know cos we decided that all three of us would get one quote for the brick and one quote for the garage  okay  and so uh so i got my one and  alton had seventy-six laugh   you know i'm slightly exagerating a little bit  but > he's you know he's just </}  every other day he's phoning me up there for a while  saying i've got somebody coming tomorrow at ten o'clock let them in and   et cetera et cetera   laugh   so actually of the ones that he calls there's maybe about a thrid of them really shows up  laugh   okay  so he probably has about three or four  alright  and leona has two i think  okay  one f for  i think she has one for the bricks and one for the garage   but i think that's what she has  ya  so we have a consensus about how the garage roof needs to be fixed  uhhm still some disagreement about why the leak is actually there in the first place  words figure i started you know   the roof started deteriorate   juan and and ah people   that you know that he that   that we've talked to with name  agreed that it is becuase of the staircase  i see  words sitting and that it's sort of forcing the roof to fold up you know because of the pressure  okay   i see  and uhm leona and alton the people that are coming in and talking to them seem to think it's because the roofing  was not done on leona's landing there   you know those uhm she's got a little balconey  and they didn't roof and then put the balconey on  ya   they the balconey if you still remember its just sort of roofed up to the beginning of the balconey  oh i see  so the underneath the balconey up to the to the wall  there's no roofing there  ya   okay  and uhm it started leaking and then it caused the uhm the uh flashing in the roof to lift up for some reason  ya   that's you know i'm i'm   not quite sure  ya though if if it caused  if it is leaking and the beams started to warp or something it could uh cause that kind of problem  ya there's one beam there that is not doing anything at all  it's it' just you know it's just you know words a six year old's tooth  in the fence   words   uhhu   uhhu   x its just / - > its very wobbly laugh   ya   if you take a stick and it'd go ploop whaah   laugh   but uh we do have a consensus but uh you know about how to fix it   so its not the quote that i got  from the carpenter now he's going to do the ro   roof i mean he gave the quote for the roof and then he was going to do the carpentry on the roof so his quote was three hundred and fifty dollars  oh that's not that bad actually   word no its not bad at all  good  yawn so uh and then  his quote f for to do  the roof is seventeen hundred and fifty dollars  ya  and leona's quote is three thousand dollars  whoa  big difference  yes it is  ya  and we've got did i tell you the quotes  that we got to do the brick in the front and the back the difference the disparity between  no  alton brought somebody who looked at the front  and it needs to be done because the mortar is coming away and there's big  gaps and cracks and  stuff and it could i mean it could end up being a really expensive job taking that all down  right   ya   so uhm alton got somebody who came and quoted six thousand dollars   so what did your uh what did your uhm   fortune-teller tell you  uhhhm she told me that after ah after  we move out together that uh laugh words  oh ya  words, maybe repeats last unclear statement  huh  yup within the next year  well as long as she does the reading list  there's no problem laugh   laugh smart ass  ya i'm looking forward to getting in there  urgh so what are we going to get today  uhh gotta get uh that that  bathmat that we've been talking about  mhhm  uhhm i don't know if we see anything else  you know if you see anything else i'll i'll   take about fifty dollars out of the bank or something and uh and  and if you see anyhting else that  that you think we should get then i'll get it  'kay well all we need is really a bath mat  i've got the towel i've got the towel thingy and that uhm the paper towel thing  and the shower thing  the shower liner  oh we need the shower liner  that's what we have to get tonight  oh right i thought i thought   you bought that already  no   what what shower thing did you buy  well its something that you hang on a showerhead and you put your shampoos in  ohhh i see  you know it keeps it all nice and neat cos i hate stuff lying on the back thing laugh   oh okay   laugh i know but it's easier to clean that   way   i thought you bought the shower liner already  nope nope  so we can go and check that out today  yup  uhh i'll show you that carpet at ahh   at ah at ah zellers two words  the store   ya  you know what today was an incredible day  this afternoon for some reason i felt uhh i felt like uhm i felt closterphobic in that place  really  it was unbelievable  i felt uh in i just wanted to get out of there    why cos it was stressful today   i i just wanted   ya and i just wanted to get out of there because uhm it it wasn't more stressful than other days it wasn't particularly you know stressful compared to  other other days of the week but for some reason i was anticipating the long weekend word  anticipate the long weekend it's like puff you just want to leave laugh   mhhm phone starts ringing and continues over conversation   and ahh uhm will you get that  no  no  so anyway i just g i just wanted to uh  i just wanted to leave i was i was really anxious to leave   so then i storm out of the place answering machine prompt plays loudly in backgorund followed by a message being left   uhm i've got my paycheck  uhm excuse me i'm competing with the answering machine here  uhh the i get to the bank   and uh then i couldn't believe that you know   you know the our of service flashing out of service on the  screen when you go to the bank machine   phone overlap ends uh and it was flashing and  laugh i thought this is ridiculous thursday everybody gets paid right and why should this thing be flashing  mhhm   ya   both machines were flashing  murphy's law  ya  so anyway there's this guy waiting you know for it to stop flashing  evidently he thought he he   thought if you waited long enough they stopped flashing  i i didn't have the patience to wait  so i just puff laugh i just  underneath my breath i just sort of swore at it and i said to hell with this you know and and uh i left  laugh phone rings again    words   they usually get fixed in uhm they normally get fixed in under five minutes don't they   ya but usually when they have  when the out of out of orders icon's flashing  it means that uh it means that uhm uhh   that they're changing they they're   putting more money into the machines phone stops ringing   you know that they choose if they're doing that  if that's the case then their choosing an ach   you know a fine time at four o'clock in the afternoon  when everyone's getting out of work early on a thursday for the long weekend they need money  but anyway i'm not complaining  laugh   that's the story there  well   and uhh   so i talked to my mom today  ya  she's cleanning out my my father's cleaning out the buffet said in

for a rocking chair  why   well the sofa goes against the north wall  ya  and you have both uh both peices  both wall units against the wall    ya   ya laugh   why are you looking at me as if i'm some kind of fool  because because you don't just have everything against the wall and have empty space in between  well there's going to be a table in between  there's going to be a t table    a table and a rocking chair  you can have a chair besides a counch  i have that that uh black chair  with the the the wire mesh-type black chair   mhhm  where are we going to put that  bathroom  laugh   laugh

scratching over the knees and everything and uh  yeah no it it's complete sort of obliviousness huh to any kind of  t-ya   word   is he word     word   a few words   yeah we've been talking for about close to forty-five minutes i'd say  we'll turn it off here   i see that you're getting rid of uhm you're younger than you think even though it will no longer be applicable  the fire dwellers now you're being a cellar dweller  laugh   and biorhythm having no rhythm but weather   word   laugh   ah vitamin e for ailing and healthy hearts  hmm by wilfred le shoot who was shot the naked ape and  worldwide french accent french dictionary french accent  yes okay thank you  yeah laugh   how much should i charge for each of those  uh try twenty-five or fifty cents  whatever you think okay   oh okay  okay well let's start over in this table  and this is stuff both for the sale and stuff that you think we should keep for the kids  mm mm   and there is some that falls in that category  yup  and there're some things here too which we can use   word   ah yeah right   you know  okay the scales i don't think it is very good  no well we don't need scales anyway  we don't  i think they should probably be heaved  yeah well heave them for a dollar  you think i should word   well get on it and show that it weighs people  uh i dunno don't know twelve pounds lighter than you actually are   laugh   y actually it weighed me eight pounds heavier laugh  oh did it  oh well that's why you wanna want to  throw it out  so it doesn't work  okay   yes exactly  that's why laugh   so okay i should uh i should  put the prices on right now while you're giving me assistance   okay well let's see   did you go to three words   no i don't think so two or three words  uh it's uhm probably   do you have uh   you have to speak towards the microphone  whoops  i won't speak towards the microphone  uh yeah that's uhm this is heavy  yeah  yeah just a sec   well word was adjusted it measures heavy  mm  so i think there's something wrong with it  it's very ancient  mm yeah  indeed it is the perfect scales if you want to lose weight  ha  cos it measures about eight pounds heavy two words  that's what i said laugh   two words   yeah  uhm  yeah so i don't know if i should even try to sell it  well you can   no sell it for the perfect scale for somebody who wants to lose weight because it always measures heavy   r really   you can set it back eight pounds too  oh yeah  and then it's okay    yeah it's true enough  okay   so adjust it  okay  you know so seven fifty laugh   no i don't know exactly how much  uh the thing is that there will be people who come and will pay whatever you've got on there  uh which is probably the majority of people  but also there're a good chunk who come and they wanna  want to bargain  so if you put it at a dollar they say oh fifty cents  so if you want a dollar out of it you put it for a dollar  two dollars   well really  yeah   so i'll put a dollar fifty  yeah  laugh you'll get a dollar out of it   cough   two or three words   okay uh   okay  intake of breath okay the clock  the clock's fine  word   yeah the clock's in perfectly good shape

i've got  this it's the cutlery  maeve had which is very nice  oh   now i dunno don't know   whether you in fact want to use it  ah okay look   uhm  instead of what you've got  or if you wanna want to just keep it for the kids but i don't i don't see any point in selling it  oh no no no no  no if it's like yours you might as well keep it  ah yeah  it's it's very much like yours from  the looks   this is it's  identical  is it  you   we got it maeve and i got it at the same time just before i went to warsaw  oh i thought yours was uh made in uhm in  denmark  well  oh that's my good stuff  this is the everyday stuff  oh okay   yeah     no you might as well keep this  you know y what we have is uh not like that uh  at all  no i know i just thought uh if you like that better you could use that and then  hmm   well yeah what is it a serving of six  eight  eight  yeah  hm  the only advantage of uh of having this is uh uhm it's probably considerably better quality than what we've got   uhm  well i'll keep it uh for the kids or whatever  yeah   yeah  how much for that garbage pail  dollar     whispers okay whisper ends   it's quite a nice one  you don't get ones like that now  yeah   well

well ottawa u university  sucks  laugh well at least you still get the science citation index in books dammit  well we're probably gonna going to  get something like that you know  cra crazy what a  what a mistake  doctor mckenzie 's really peeved at the librarians needless to say  although wha what   you know in theory it it sounds pretty neat  ya it does you know   word you write everything down  you say sheet a   two words ya exactly you know  but like i mean to students  fuff could be the three word    and that's the somehow what they   if only somehow they could make like a main system  you know where it's so that anyone can have access to it at anytime  yes if if they network it  like the like the normal data search system  ya  ya that'll be fine cos then you could access it by the internet  you can access it on any terminal  ya   that'll be perfect  words   and like more people can you know access  it at once  mhhm   but so far they got one dedicated computer that isn't networked  which is dumb  it's really confusing when i went in today mmm puff  the uh  taste good ya laugh   ugh there's too many bugs here  laugh   they all love me  laugh it's the glasses that's what it is  bug-glasses  laugh you got it  mhhhmmm bug noise   laugh   you just awful a guy  argh   okay sorry laugh laugh   go ahead laugh   actually i'm not that bad  anne gets the worst   what  everytime we go out bugs follow her  mhhm   i don't know what she wears   laugh laugh   they love her  they eat her  laugh eau de f one  generation laugh i don't know  ya   but oh ya anyways what i was saying the  computers that uh i'll be working with next year  uhm silicon graphics  mhhm   mhhm   oh my god you lucky bastard laugh oh geez   wooo   laugh what are you gonna going to  do  you're gonna going to get that taste of power and then the forty-six is gonna going to   be you know like laugh   it's fast  you know with your mac molecule it did that thing in like vvv connoting speed   uhhn   it's like rotator and like   in like you know seconds  oh man   that's that's incredible  argh jeez wow  ya  ya they're making a games system with nintendo eh silicon graphics in it  that's scary  eh no endorsements  no endorsements laugh   laugh   jee  well  laugh i'm actually i think  we're gonna going to i'm gonna  going to give my mac to my parents in the next few weeks and cos carleton university  is selling off a uh a mac that's   that's going out of issue i guess  laugh   it it's a  about a four eighty-six twenty-five megahertz equivalent  s x  i guess  oh that's gonna going to be ancient  ya i know  but uh   but you mean you're getting an i b m  no no i'm getting a mac the mac equivalent of a four eighty-six twenty-five  oh okay okay alright   but see it's uh it's one thousand dollars with like a two hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive monitor  four megabytes ram  that's not bad   see so that's not a bad price  so i word   and considering what you're going to be doing with it  exactly ya you know  it'll still run cd-rom stuff and so on if i want but uh i i   hmm   does it come with a cd-rom  no it doesn't no  but my mom has eighteen hundred in grant money and she's  gotta has got to she's gotta   has got to spend that by the end of this summer  or she loses it  laugh ya right my mom even paid for half of your med school bill laugh   buy your uh rice-a-roni or kraft dinner for the year okay jeez  laugh   but word she has that much to spend  yes  mhh   so she's got uh laugh   i'll talk to ya after laugh   no but she's gonna going to get uh like the uhm the mac and then she's gonna  going to get a hard drive for my old one  uh huh  it's only bout about a forty  and then maybe gonna going to get a cd-rom or a colour printer  my dad wants a colour printer so we'll see  mmh  ya that'd be nice laugh   cool   ya  well he my dad wants to get a colour and then just network it cos now we got three macs in the house so all the macs use the same printer  it'll work nice  hmm you have to be in the same room no  no it's different just cable ya   word get long cables   well there's uhm see we got the house renovated we got uh  cable outlets put out put in around the house and i think they're wired in the walls   so we could probably   i don't know if we could do that  that's to put telephones in no  oh no cable  ya  no th i think it's by like an eighteen cable so maybe we can't use the cable outlets we have  like the outlets are cable as in t v cable  ya but unless maybe you might have an interface or something  no idea  if it's like by telephone cable then that's just two wires essentially  you could marry that easy to a coaxial cable  we'll see i don't know  central system  in the word duh duh duh duh duh  'mission impossible' theme hummed   here at the computing centre about brandy   we had the best alright   i don't know   printers   s printers laugh   computers and uh   rabbit pictures laugh   laugh that's it ya   nov nov   novelty items  laugh novelty items  uh nevermind laugh   laugh   speaking of which no not novelty items okay my twisted mind came up with three dimensional objects and computers okay  uh but there there's a system   physiziss physicists and engineers have been using and it's and actually a bio  biological application i had read about   uhm what it is is it's a uh uh uh it's a   pool of p polymer essentially that is heated by laser  when it's heated by laser it dr dries  solid to a plastic  and this laser is hooked up to a computer and if you give it a three dimensional graphic it will cool thin layers of plastic on top of each other until it gets the three dimensional object  oh no way   two words   ya it's totally cool  and what they did was they uh did x-rays of a uh no i guess it'd be magno magnetic  resonance imaging of a of a of a mummy cos they wanted to look at the skull shape and stuff or some sort of   was this on the discoverer   i think it was i can't remember  it was in the   cos i re remember   some i remember reading bout  about something like that   ya and then they did it  they they s did i guess m r i of the uh the skull so they didn't have to dissect it and then they recreated a three dimensional uh replica of the skull  mhhm   ah   it it was really  impressive  i don't think i we i remember re   i didn't ch i didn't  catch on about the three dimensional plastic making thing  laugh laugh making thing  laugh device laugh   that's it   device that's a word for a scientist now laugh   device words the uh   device is just a word that word a  word laugh   yes laugh device  arnold schwarzenegger ya   have you seen the critic  nope no i ha no  they ah they were reviewing a uh  cough arnold schwarzenegger movie on the critic kind of thing  it was rabbi p i with arnold schwarzenegger laugh   no   laugh ya he was bad  it was really good  man  i that's done by the same guys who did the simpsons  like not matt groening but two of the other guys who produce it  ya  ya  he doesn't do much though does he matt groening   i always see is his name on like developed by bang  or uh creative consulting or something ya   laugh   so i guess he just thought up the characters   he just rakes in the royalties laugh   well i think initially he helped more but uh  well no on the on the halloween specials i think he was listed as a producer  mhhm   maybe not i don't know  see that's how what i don't understand about this showbiz stuff  you get like okay produced by so and so directed by  such and such a blah blah blah film written by duh  duh duh you know like  who's the big boss here  mhhm   laugh   laugh   mhhm   laugh that's a tough call   see what what a producer does what   director generally creates the vision and says this is what i want to see  producer generally actually makes it come into being  they're both on the set  often the director will order actors and say uh i want you to do this i want to show this kind of emotion i want this set to look dark like this i want the lighting to be like this  the producer actually gets the lighting guy and says okay these are the kinds of levels we need set them up uhm i'll order some more lights for you i'll get this so  mhhm   i think the director is more visionary translates the writer's vision and the producer tends to help enact it  so when they say it's a such and s   such it's a so and so film so what does that mean  that guy like provides the cash   puff owns the company laugh   he brings the doughnuts everyday  that's the most important part laugh   i don't know  but i think that's like uh whoever owns the company  like the simpsons and so on was done by a group called klasky csupo  laugh i know what what a weird name laugh    was there a dog at the end  eh  was it the dog at the end no   no  oh well the company see it's a tough call  the animation's done by klasky csupo i think the filming or something or the printing of the film is another company  klasky csupo got big  they're doing they do like the simpsons the critic they do rugrats they do they do   a whole bunch of shows  it's funny now eh how like cartoons are  are being like sitcoms  yes i know eh laugh   well i guess we got sick of  i don't know i i'm if i watch like fresh prince or i don't know any of it almost any of those shows wings is one of the few that i kind of stand but  almost any other it's like ya it's typical sitcom funny  like you know they get in trouble they're  they do stupid things they're words   word to reach a  better understanding  exactly you know laugh   well what's funny is that how how  all these kind of crop up all at once   sniff excuse me   well how do you mean  like the animated ones versus the   ya l like  you have an animated one and then you know you come out with the critic you come out with the ru rugrats   beavis and butthead and what not  simpsons and uh   oh ya beavis and butthead  it comes out all at once  and then and then like you know you have a sitcom you know when the sitcoms come out then like you know the family sitcoms cosby show then you had the family ties you know family matters and stuff like that  yes ya hmph jeez  now now i think they're getting into like since rosanne come not 'came' out now they're getting into the dysfunctional families   laugh yes which is kind of disgusting  really laugh   you think  i don't know if i wanted to hear about  dysfunctional families ya   like see i i ehm i   i didn't watch em them so i don't know what they're about   oh okay ya well they're not bad comedy-wise but it is a little uh it's it's a little crude  and and   nah i don't it's not something i   wanna want to see 
Canada	 like i mean do you wanna want to  watch a dysfunctional family  somebody that like yells at their kids or doesn't get along well   well i some people   wanna want to watch it so that you know i feel good  ya   my family's better than theirs ya right   i feel good by uh what is it  who was it homer simpson said that didn't he  laugh ya   yes he did   sometimes you have to make yourself feel good by  making somebody else feel bad and i'm tired of making people feel good   something like that   laugh   interesting laugh   what else there's like talkshows eh  there's talkshows   ya that's that's  always big in the mornings i think cos there's uh probably   they can get pretty bad  what was you know when you were telling me   uh about uh phone one eight hundred such and such   laugh yes

whatever it is  regis and kathy lee live   ya that's it ya laugh   that's not bad  i mean at least  th they like had an interview with the lady from voyager and stuff like that  they don't exploit quite so much but they're still a little  i don't know i guess i c literally i can't help but laugh at regis philbin laugh   what can you do  ya it's weird  no i don't watch  ya  the only thing i see

on a saturday   no no usually it was like uh  it was like well it was more like a like   if if we set aside a day it was like from  a soon as i could get there to or as soon as she could get to ottawa to like i don't know eight or nine hours we'd spend  oh  first time actually was kind of surprising  we spent like hmm fifteen hours  we spent four hours talking beside the uhh lake ontario  it was

you're ah they   they plan it so much ya it  probably gets pretty dry  ya   but uh well except i don't know i   f from from some of the stuff like on entertainment tonight  i watch that too  oh my goodness i watch entertainment tonight laugh  sad  uh sorry  seeing jim carey on there a lot of his interviews are very   he seems very spontaneous and like totally  i don't know if he gets sick of the stuff cos he's a   he's a funny guy laugh   totally unplanned he's funny  you think he's funny  i don't know i i get annoyed with him  oh laugh   well uh i i think his face is annoying  oh laugh i

is the daughter with the dark hair who's tough mean  charlene or something darlene i don't know ya anyway got angry with her boyfriend cos she thought she she assumed  because he was hanging out with the babysitter ah ah at a house this girl and talking about uh his relationship with  darlene she kinda kind of  assumed he was he was having an affair you know flirting around  darlene   mhhm   and she got really ticked off at him  and uh she tried to get this explained like rosanne explained to him what he had done laugh and she goes like uhm you know  you made her angry now you get to apologize   laugh you know like it's an honour  ya  and he's like but i know i'm right   and he dan leans over and goes  doesn't matter   laugh   laugh and he's walkin   walking out of the room goin  going well i know i'm right   dan kinda kind of taps something it goes slap slap slap the guy turns around doesn't matter  laugh   that's exactly it laugh   that's exactly it  it's true  hey you do you and shelly ever get into fights  i well i guess you don't have  no not well well not really   well we've never really had to  you've never had to ya i guess you have  you're not at that stage   haven't gotten that far into it yet you know   ya  we're still at the uh pathetic stage laugh    that's good though  oh ya i think it's awesome laugh   it it'll change but i mean that's normal  that's a natural relationship  you have your ups and your downs  it's not perfect  ya  god if i meet the perfect woman i'll feel too intimidated  laugh   i don't know what the hell i'd do  i don't think i've ever had the pathetic stage  ya right laugh   in this you know  ya right laugh you should have heard yourself a year ago  no but   you had a pathetic stage  no i   i did  and then some  laugh ya you did  no way   laugh you don't  you didn't realize it  laugh dude i don't think i realize it either  i'm probably more pathetic than i think i am but uh you  know  no   you did  ya you did  how did you know  how did i know  well wha what like what  cos you were pathetic laugh how do i explain it  i don't know you were gushy you were talking about her here there and everywhere  you were cooing  you had like dovey eyes  you were all this anne this anne that  laugh   what   laugh it was kinda kind of  cute funny ya laugh   hmm   yes  laugh ya   don't worry   too bad pathetic stage couldn't last forever  i know laugh cos it's that ultimate  high just joy  high   well but it still goes on i think that it  just turns into a deeper love  ya   all that sort of stuff  ya   then you marry and you have kids  deep exhale ya   laugh   ya   no it's too early to have kids   laugh darn right  jeez man  kids i couldn't even imagine having kids  i wanna want to be on my own  for a while first  i understand that yup  get a feel of the singlehood  laugh   well pseudo-singlehood   rampant debauchery laugh   rampant debauchery   i like that  i have to get that printed on a t-shirt laugh no  i am into rampant debauchery   laugh rampant debauchery   ah that's it for your next birthday you are getting a laugh  t-shirt  a lot of people wouldn't understand that word   laugh then on the back property of  anne   laugh she'd never let you wear it not that    word no no  rampant debauchery property of anne   mhh  laugh just kidding  don't worry she'll never know   should get you a shirt rampant  debauchery   laugh property of shelly  laugh   shorts  rampant debauchery shorts that are all like tattered and torn  laugh claw marks lipstick stains  ya actually last night w when  anne held my hand she kinda kind of   dug her nails in my  laugh it's all getting in into this now are we  laugh we've gone from the uh pathetic stage to the relationship stage to the s and m stage laugh is that what this is  no it was like i'm angry at what i see at the screen so i'll not "" i'm"" going to vent it on my boyfriend   laugh oh i see  that's the stage  laugh whew jeez  ya that was that was kind of a brutal movie  that was a little bit worse than rob roy   ya  ya it was   i word it was  laugh   laugh well well   rob roy tended to show it it it wasn't so gruesome or so hard  i mean a a lot of the killing in there was totally without mercy and i think they showed that to show  that like the king's lack of feeling and desire for power but uh the uhm  but did you think that some of the stuff were   was unnecessary  oh definitely but that was typical of the times   it was set in   no no i mean in the movie to show it  to show it   ya   yes well yes and no  like to see to see like he rides in to one of the nobleman's ah whatever his  house and crushes his head with an  nuh you know they dint  didn't necessarily had to show that  mhhm   mhhm   mhhm   you know   ya   they could have just like they didn't have to show him  getting his head words   yeah they could've shown him swinging and then like a a thud or him running out of the building or whatever  uh ya but see that that's that's   certainly is more realistic you know  true i don't know   but uh ya it was a little bit much i thought  like the disemboweling the whole bit was rather gruesome  you know what i think   ya  holy cow   you know what i think  hmm  i think they wanted to make this film an epic  yes ya   see two hours it's a movie  three hours it's an epic   laugh but it was good  i uh the story was good and  it was  i liked it words   it was historical i called it historical  hmm  well anne didn't like it very much  oh really  oh jeez  she said   she should see rob roy cos that's a lot better  it's a lot more about love all that  she'd love that  ya i'd ya   laugh this this kind of the romance left and ya you're right then it was an epic  ya   it was like it kinda kind of  was   slaughter   it kinda kind of  jus just didn't it kind of mislead you   the uh the trailer  a bit yes ya cos initially and in  the first part of the movie the whole bit i was like he's   gonna going to grow up to be a noble guy he's  gonna going to save his girl and  the whole bit you know  oh no   ah right   but his girl gets killed and then man i was totally shocked  i was like   that's it  ya  he only got to you know the romantic word  once laugh   laugh but once was enough and with the queen let me say laugh   and once was enough to shall i say hit the bull's eye   laugh   laugh ew this is good  what uh but ya the the  romantic interest disappears initially  and the rest of it's kind of i don't know it didn't  it had a bit to do with freedom but it laugh was more one man's vendetta against the world two words  and taking out his rage on his lost love and it's kinda kind of   and had to use sticks and spears and axes   ya laugh no no  well i i lost a little kind of respect for him as a what i would've would have  thought a hero because he wasn't you know after a point it wasn't vengeance anymore you know  he he killed the guy who killed his girl that was kinda kind of revenge and   you know  ya   but after that it was this man's rage and his   two words fight   no but he wanted freedom for his people  even that didn't you know ahh i don't know i guess i'm comparing it to rob roy cos there was a he was much more noble quest for freedom   ya but rob roy is a fictitious character isn't he   yes but you know  of course you're gonna going to   word it's an epic a historical movie of real life happenings  laugh ya ya i guess   i don't know  rob roy the only thing i s  saw the only thing i saw in rob roy that turned me off was this big chested man  behind a tree kissing this woman and it just reminded me of those what are those romance novels those  harlequin it was a straight  cover of harlequin   mhhm   mhhm   harlequin laugh   laugh   okay this movie will be like a harlequin romance  and i was like forget it  laugh   oh no it wasn't actually  eh uh the romance was well done  and the whole nudity whatever  laugh nudity ha no it was pretty it was pretty sensitive i mean it was you know i don't know  what can i say  the villain was great  holy cow by the end of the movie you were hating the bastard  why   laugh it was like ya ya kill him roar  cheering   it was good  it was really pleasing  he was a total prick laugh jeez  even in real life like uh it's just his look and his manners  if these are his real life manners boy i couldn't stand the guy  laugh   laugh   even if he was a like a laugh  frankly if he was a priest laugh i'd   change religions   no     that's what that's what makes a good actor is   ya   hi i'm here to play the annoying prick  alright

well hopefully we're gonna going to   get away from these scottish documentaries scottish accent or whatever historical documentaries   you know what i did last night i started  talking in a scottish accent and she said  oh   what are you giving to the dog there andy   uhm some green pepper that had that's  fell on the ground  okay edie you come here  lay down on the floor  you lay down  okay now stay outta out of  the way   where's my dinner   pardon me  she's asking where's my dinner  she had hers word   she already ya she already had her dinner this morning  she gets her dinner in the morning  so ya once   are you   well haven't you noticed she's lost a little bit of weight  you mentioned  well no but i mean can you not notice  ya i ya you do notice  huh no cos i'm not really sure uhm i know if we go back to the vet in july and she says anything about   i've been doing some reading and they said laugh there are some vets that are actually forcing weight reduction programs on their clients  really   well certainly   well ya it's in the best interest of the dog  i have a friend whose uhm bassett hound died of  obesity  it broke its back  oh my gosh  ya but you're talking about a dog with short legs  too  you know phrase   uh short uh short short legs and a wide girth  still you'd think you'd notice once the dog was getting fat  i dunno don't know   you'd hope you'd notice anyway   i know   my vet told me that i was supposed to brush  prince prince 's teeth  did you ever get anywhere with that  i know   no  laugh boony was at the vet today and he bought the dog some mouthwash  laugh   ehm he says the dog's teeth are too yellow  well they're quite dirty actually  it will apparently uhm prolong the like  the the cleaning that's required ev  every two years or whatever i don't actu  actually at a vet's office   you can prolong the the period between those visits  it's just  i don't actually   well i don't know i grew up with dogs   and we never brought our dogs to the dentist  ever  laugh really   well but times have changed  i don't know i think it's too faddish myself  faddish  well  too much of a fad  ya   noel tell me about this  placement interview then   the one at the y y m c a   ya   it sounds pretty interesting   laugh as i said before laugh it's got two parts to it there'd be either i be working   in either with groups doing self-help  there're self help groups there   hmm   you've got a number of different kinds  there's the they had one this year on body image but i think it just finished  and then the one that keeps go  going that they have most involvement with is the incest survivors adul adults  incest survivors who are adults   mhhm  and that's goi going   that would involve being sort of coordinating the groups running the groups and then being there for crisis  if there's any kind of crisis intervention needed that would be they hopefully would turn to me  hmm  and if i wanted to do individual counselling i can do that as well  are there that's that's  how is the y subsidized for that program do you know  and then   the self-help stuff  ya  i'm not sure  because i know on the radio yesterday they were talking about they were making reference to that woman  who was recently killed by her husband and how the legal system basically failed to recognize all of the signs even though she was saying that you know her husband had made threats against her and this sort of thing  and she was just recently murdered   is that the one that uhm the c l s c   centres locaux de services communautaires , community health authority social workers knew from the husband that he wanted to  yes yes and they didn't do anything about it   and she had warned about it too hadn't she  exactly  and the p police   and the police were supposed to be involved as well  and what happened was uhm you know the police basically said well what do you expect us to do provide twenty-four hour surveillance   and i mean i think the argument was that yes i mean you do   uhm   when there's been a threat  uhm exactly  so anyways they were talking about making recommendations to  you know what would happen if everytime there's been a complaint like that or a threat like that that you know what the police was trying to what the police were trying to say was that uhm you can't take every threat seriously because people tend to say those things all the time  but it di hadn't there been   a history of abuse as well  well i don't know  i didn't did you know anything about the case cos i hadn't heard anything  you know they didn't really say that much  very little ah i assumed there'd been a history of abuse especially if they were involved with the c l s c for counselling  ya  so anyways but one of the recommendations that what they were making is that social workers should become integrated within the police force as  to intervene and do  counselling with cases rather than waiting them to go to  ah transition houses   when i   mhhm   when i was when i was   living in london i working with the dist   distress the london distress centre there  and part of the one of the training things that i went to there was with the police and they were talking about they'd just started a program where social workers were working with the   p police in conjunction with   the police was that actually in the police force   and uhm that when they the police responded to a domestic violence call then the social worker would go as well  mhhm   mhhm  mhh  and that it was the social worker basically who was intervening and the the police were the ones who were making sure that nothing worse happened or nothing else happened ensuring the safety of everybody there  mhhm   and it sounded like it was an excellent program  my supervisors supervisor at d y p  director of youth protection where i was working this year uhm  pam lafleur she's starting that here with the montreal  police force working with them especially in terms of sexual abuse and child sexual abuse  having social workers working with the police force and they're responding to cases like that  lay down andy   mhhm   cos often at dw at youth protection  you'd get a call about se sexual  about sexual ab abuse   about child sexual abuse and then they'd often have a police person going in going and interviewing the child as well without a social worker there and it  often the police weren't trained at all in that kind of  thing word   well no they're there for totally different purposes  mhh   ya and it ended up that they've had some really bad kind of results  not always obviously but often some really negative results in the child  mhhm   oftentimes the police forces will uhm  will request kind of coalition or this kind of working together you know  with other professions  professionals   mhhm   mhhm   the new director at mcgill for social work todd stone   i went to his job talk the one just before he   before   was it the lecture he did before  chr christmas uh just after christmas  ya and it was before he was hired it was sort of like his test  right  mhhm  and uhm he he's been working on that in new brunswick nova scotia   newfoundland   newfoundland   newfoundland okay   close  somewhere over there     laugh   right region  okay and he's been working again with child sexual abuse as a police with the police   force getting social workers and police working in conjunction  and says that they've been going through a training program the police and the social workers in it that  so that the s training program is run by  a police person and a social worker     cough   mhhm "
Canada	 yeah so i just got a message from my professor uhm on  the answering machine saying that uh he's gonna < going to ask me to do some research this summer  which would be fun  and last time i i did research for him  a summer ago on uhm south africa  i did a little bit on south africa and i did some a  literature review on uh canadian politics  and recently actually while i was working with uh james teed  he asked me uh uh to do something on uh harold innes  do you know who harold innes is  yes i do  so uhm maybe he wants to go back to that  so  wow   yeah   this is you political spec uh this is your political   word   he wants to do uh you think he might want to do research on harold innes  yeah well he wrote on it before amd then he went to europe so i imagine you can't do research on innes while you're in europe so he may want to come back to that  well there is uhm   i was just reading a newsletter from this uhm the  canadian historical association  and someone has mentioned in passing to this uh renewal of interest in harold innes  and i was kind of surprised because uhm uh sort of in the field of my particular specialization uh innis is just someone who is wrong  laugh   laugh you know uh or wasn't uhm  staple word   no not so much the st staple   well in part for me is the way he uses staple food to describe the economy of france but also the way he applied it to the fur trade   in his book the fur  trade   mhhm   mhhm   it's just very uhm is still read and still worth reading but  uhm he missed a lot of what was going on #so i guess i just don't know why people uhm find him   i i guess i don't even know much about innes anyways  i've only i've only uhm heard of his work after uh after the conquest and after  probably even after confederation to explain the differences between the ontario and the qu&eacute;bec economies  uh huh  and uhm so that's so it seems kind of interesting from my perspective  and and probably to tell you the truth i bet my prof who's interested in him is partly interested because uh  guinness offers a way of explaining qu&eacute;bec's uhm  inequality the inequality of qu&eacute;bec's economy in a way that  isn't isn't negative to uh a qu&eacute;bec nationalist perspective  because it kind of blames everything on uh natural resources and  not doesn't put any on the culture  so uhm that's probably one of the reasons that he's interested   in in innes  hmm  so  so uh let's talk the bucks laugh   laugh   i mean it uh i'm doing research for a prof uh in my department  and uhm fortunately that research is not  it's really just finding a bunch of documents  and it's not it's not it doesn't take me away from my research because uhm i'm i would be looking in the same uh archival series anyway so that  so when i'm looking for documents for myself  and i find something for her  it's fine   uh huh   uh huh   but uhm we we haven't really discussed money or anything uh  i i i suspect that it's only going to be like eleven bucks an hour  well this is what yeah this is the  kind of ballpark that that this other prof mentioned uh sort of  i uh she said keep track of your hours and you know uh we'll figure out uhm  and i said well what is what is it about what is it   what is a research assistant paid approximately per hour and uh  she thought it was something like twelve so  she said twelve  yeah  but again she words   words sure she just told you to keep track of your hours and then tell her at the end  yeah  that would be good actually for me  do you think it would be dishonest to continue to   laugh   yes yes   yeah  i wouldn't lose any sleep   uhm yes  hmm that would be like   because you know what i could do  yes  laugh   but you know uhm because i i saw someone  it's uh i it's it's uh not so much a matter of honesty it's a matter of just uhm uhm uhm covering your butt  i mean uhh   well you know there there   will be t 4 forms canadian personal income tax form sent out  yeah but the thing is they don't know they don't know anything about if i if the   if the demand or if the requisition goes through  now michael don't judge me laugh   i won't   i mean if i were in your position i would be tempted too  but it's just that i mean you have you have to be careful because uh you know you could be running for office some day and say excuse me uh is the right honorable so and so uh laugh ever uh  multiple words   laugh   okay but uhm  yeah okay  i'm maybe you're not the best person to talk about this with laugh   but uh  hmm  the thing is it would be kind of easy because the uh i could just ask to calculate the number hours and then put in the requisition at the very end after i had maybe started to be a student at as uh in  in teacher's college so that then i wouldn't be collecting u i unemployment insurance anymore  in which case money  yeah anyway so you know i wouldn't do anything maybe   il illegal i guess it would still be illegal but  you just had  just check the fine print  i mean i'm not i don't believe that you know  you know that i'm not uhm i  to that extent i obey laws not because i believe them to be morally correct or anything but just because uh it saves uh uh it can save you from later hassles or whatever  you know for instance i've done something naughty  laugh you have  well i i didn't file a gee i  don't laugh   laugh   uhm uh this is uh i've become aware that uh if you're living in this province it's kind of an interesting situation because you have the federal income tax return and the provincial income tax return right  uh huh  and uhm to what i i wonder i really wonder to what extent the the two uh revenue departments uhm uh communicate like share   pretty much so i'm sure  you think so  yeah  it's one of the few areas of federalism in which there is great co-operation  oh laugh   because no  it's true it's true  so so the qu&eacute;bec government knows who files a federal income tax uh return in the province of qu&eacute;bec  you think they know that  the federal government  no the qu&eacute;bec government  for instance let's say someone filed a federal income tax return in an as a resident of qu&eacute;bec  uh huh  and so the federal government you know processes or whatever  but does then the qu&eacute;bec know  let's say the qu&eacute;bec qu&eacute;bec   government does not receive a return from that person  yeah but you've send both you send both returns to the same address  you send both returns to ottawa or to sudbury or  or whatever it is  it's it's sudbury for ontario i don't know what it is in qu&eacute;bec  you send the same you send the same     word regional offices uh   yeah you send probably here in montreal   you send the same form both the federal and the quebec one are sent to the same address  are they  yeah  and you pay one cheque  you write one cheque which includes both your federal and provincial taxes and then they the feds federals  transport that money to the province  that's the word   have you ever filled out a qu&eacute;bec income tax form  no  well no it's a completely separate form  it's a seperate form but you put it in the same envelope  in in london ontario you send it to sudbury  in in ontario ontario taxes  is is there's a section actually in the return for the calculation of ontario tax  not only income tax but also the individual surtax  and that is in the calc  calculation the final calculation   yeah you're right but in qu&eacute;bec there's two different forms  and you you can fill out the federal income tax  there's no reference to qu&eacute;bec provincial income tax   except as a except as a actual credit that you get because you you they assume you're paying some kind of qu&eacute;bec income   oh so you have to pay two different cheques for qu&eacute;bec  yes  you have to pay two different cheques and i'm sure the addresses are different as  well because uh the addresses with  to which the federal forms are sent are uhm sorta  sort of multiple words tax something uh  oh   oh okay   in fact that may be the one for qu&eacute;bec  oh i understand  so okay this is a special arrangement they have with qu&eacute;bec but i'm sure i'm still very sure that they  they keep track of uh that that's   one of the areas of great inter-provincial co-operation  certainly in ontario it would be because it's the same form you know as we saw  yeah   and they have to sorta sort of  split up the monies at some point  but in qu&eacute;bec you could the thing  could work quite seperately so  uh huh   so what will you uh what will you  have that multiple words   words laugh   i guess the i guess your point is that as a qu&eacute;bec resident in a sense the federal government gives you money in order to pay your qu&eacute;bec taxes because you get a   credit on your income  tax return  uh huh   uh huh   uh that may be uh that may be uh uh falsely presenting it simply because uh   but this is this is to the person  filling out the form this is what it looks like uhm especially if you're from ontario because in ontario you get to this point at the end of the income return where you have to pay more tax because it's the ontario right provincial tax  uh huh   and then you pay even more cos there's the individual  surtax   uh huh   like when you're filling out the federal return in qu&eacute;bec when you get to the same part of the form you  you get a credit in qu&eacute;bec which is based on your uh uhm the amount of federal tax that you pay  uh huh   uh huh  so if you're paying you know a thousand bucks of federal   tax you get with qu&eacute;bec's    you get this uh credit   uh huh   uh huh   uh huh   but then you pay a lot more in your tax to qu&eacute;bec  ah if you pay your tax to qu&eacute;bec laugh    ya laugh     word word     word word   inaudible exchange   well i'm sure that you you have to put resident of qu&eacute;bec where it says which in which province do you do you reside as of the thirty-first of december nineteen ninety-four   yes you do words that's right   words absolutely they're gonna  going to check that  but why would they care  well it's because they have a mutual interest in   in   yeah i guess so  it's interesting  in fact you know how the bible has different degrees of sin  then i would say your degree is much greater than mine   laugh   i'm not word   at least i wasn't doing it i'm just < unclear> words  laugh   laugh   no but it's interesting because uhm i haven't paid my debt either so  ya  uhm ya uhm uhh if you're if you're  receiving a cheque from a company in qu&eacute;bec you know it's pretty clear then that the trail of t 4 forms will lead back you know to  to the money you're making but uh if the  if the qu&eacute;bec government doesn't have any direct knowledge of the money you're making then you know  i think i get paid in cash anyway  or or if the money comes directly from the government in the form of a grant or something  they issue a t 4 for a grant  yes but not not not there's not accompanying there's no no there's no accompanying it's only a federal form there's no accompanying provincial form  see what i mean  oh 
Canada	 in canada it was legalized in nineteen sixty-nine so it must have been after that  under trudeau  under trudeau yeah  was that when he made his speech uh the state has no right in the bed   yes   really  yes  oh okay  in the bedroom   and a lot of people are saying when   like in the attempt to include sexual orientation as a grounds for discrimination in the human rights act  people are saying like the reformers people from the reform party  canadian political party are are uhm saying uhm we should go back to that concept of the state has no place in the beds of the nation  in other words don't make anti-discrimination laws  which is ridiculous  yeah it's interesting how those the fed  the how the kinds of uh word  something to do with the evolution of the state in the last twenty years that they're kind of  the rhetoric that would have been appropriate to liberalism has now become appropriate to a kind of conservative outlet  uh huh  well it's the difference i think between uhm looking at uhm equality of opportunity or or pure equality  you know uh are we satisfied just to treat everybody equal or do we want everyone to have equality of opportunity  uh huh   in which case some people have to be treated  preferentially  well that was the that was  the i guess the uh discourse of liberalism uh in the middle of the century when word  focused more on a a kind of legal equality   or uh or nominal equality  uh huh   hmm   that is uh you know everyone is uh equal under the law  yeah yeah certain amount of a a  focus on individual rights rather than any focus on uh experiences of  groups in particular or   hmmm   but i think that's that latter  you know concept of equality is is coming around  a lot of that is to do with the charter  yeah yeah  although it's kind of interesting because uhm in the long run you don't want to uh   well this this argument is is  is uh it comes up in in some of the feminist theory that that i end up reading  because the idea is that uh the main issue is that  uhm as you say preferential treatment for certain groups but in the long run you want in a sense the not only  the uhm the sense of group but also the preferential treatment to disappear or the the distinction to disappear  hmmm  because what creates distinction in the first place and what creates the need for preferential treatment is a history of disadvantage or domination  and then in that is is  to a large extent what creates identity in groups that are   you know   oppressed   uh huh   uh huh   so uhm it's like like cindy  was saying would say that identity uhm can only emerge from uhm a position of disadvantage  uh huh  and that's why there's no canadian identity as such because we never really managed to words there's a strong qu&eacute;bec identity  right but then then you get to the question of is this real disadvantage or perception of disadvantage  ya ya because   because i understand qu&eacute;bec sort of disadvantages are a rhetorical argument too political argument  yeah   yeah cough word   but part of a cynical side of me that kinda   kind of thinks that everyone likes to feel disadvantaged  there's something about human nature that makes us want to feel disadvantaged to feel part of some sort of a group  laugh short phrase  laugh   laugh i i i i  never really thought of uhm  it never occurred to me that people uh wanted to uh  hmmm maybe i did it  maybe i should uh think about that  or you don't do it and that's why you don't have a  an identity laugh   laugh but i no  i don't have a word or weren't stupid   laugh   uh but there's also uh i don't know i mean uhm i have a strong sense of personal identity  but it's true that i lack a sense of group identity  which is uh that's that's kind of true so uh  hmm   where'd you get that t-shirt  in new york in new york word   word oh ya   remember when i was there with uh ryan   when was that  oh it was in october of ninety-three  ah  yeah  for thanksgiving   uh yeah it was the thanksgiving weekend in the states  yeah   down to new york two or three words    hmmm   shouldn't have flown should have taken the bus but   but anyways i was doing field work then and so i couldn't really i didn't really have the time to spare  uh huh  so other than that i would have taken the bus  so anyway i want to get back  tell tell me a little bit about this priest thing  it takes place in where  in london in in england   uh uhm liverpool   liverpool  and he's anglican or catholic   catholic   catholic priest  hmm and so he's his dilemma i had the impression from some of the promos and stuff that it was  it was also a question was on uh assault or he had to uh  he was told something in confession and had  to  yeah there's two there's two  parallels issues  one is his homosexuality the other is incest which is disclosed to him uh in the confessional booth  hmmm   and his personal crisis is whether to uphold the traditions and the rules of the church and not and not   uhm not disclose not not uhm reveal what was disclosed to him or to stop the suffering of this girl who wouldn't allow wouldn't wouldn't give him permission to tell   her her mother  wait who confessed the girl  the girl confessed but she didn't want him to tell anyone  and do anything about it and so uh  why did she confess  i mean she uh usually you confess sins   yeah i know but i mean she had to talk to someone she just it was after she after she'd finished confessing   and then and uhm she just hadn't told anyone in her life so  so i mean he is struggling with his dilemma which was uh basically the whole idea whether the church should be uh we should recognize uhm the the problems in institutional constraint and be flexible enough to allow for uh changes in the rules when when we need or whether tradition and authority should always uh win over  and that's the same thing with him  i mean should he uh be allowed to experiment with his sexuality in order to be a better priest in order to know himself better or uhm does he have to totally repress everything so   hmmm   and at the end he and at the end   he he's charged with uh conducting in an act and uh he's like ostracized from the whole parish and everyone you know what i mean  and it's this really wonderful uh his fellow   colleague priest is really great  and he comes he he encourages uhm   the the priest the first priest to come back and do mass together with him and uhm in that way he'd be showing that his sin is no greater than the uh the sins of the average person  uhm and so he does that but everyone in the congregation  in the parish uh totally ostracizes him except for that one young girl who ah who wrote to him her incest  so so that's showing you   that's just showing that they each are supporting each other  anyway uh he's very emotional laugh   laugh   like and afterwards he was very mad at himself for  not not stopping her suffering  and he apologized to her cos he knew he was  he should have stopped the suffering but he didn't and so i think that turned out with that  she was the first one to forgive him for his sins which made   it her her forgiveness all the more christian and all the more uhm uh laudable  right but did she blame him for not   no   but the mother did and maybe she did herself  you mean blame him for not telling   yep   and her mother did  her mother did  her mother blamed it on the priest at the end  this is your fault that we didn't know  if you had told us we would have stopped this and i hope you rot in hell  oh dear   so ya   pretty serious stuff  ya  but it was an interesting study by incest uhm victims and perpetrators  uh i wonder the character that was the perpetrator is  uhm is traditional is what you would expect the attitude to be if that person were to be  which is totally unapologetic totally unapologetic  he would actually talk to the priest about it and say i'm just doing what every man every husband every father wants to do and that  it's uh   this is in the film  ya ya ya   the perp perpetrator   the the guy says  the ather defends his acts vehemently and says stay out of my business  and i asked matt if he thought that that was uh  wha which is often the attitude of perpetrators or if they would feel guilty you know  but apparently not  but at least in his opinion they were quite uhm uhm willing to accept and condone their own activities   so then why would he have any special knowledge  that's true laugh   laugh that'd be like a police detective or words   he's catholic laugh   he's catholic  yeah two or three words arrived at the church  right  cough truly he doesn't know anything about incest but it just is uh  four words if we know anything about   word   laugh   hey man that's that whole concept of liberalism  can we speak  laugh   probably slander anybady can we   laugh   specially especially  people who can't who won't defend themselves like  words   laugh   words gonna  going to stand up and go hey that's not true  i feel guilty as heck like whoops laugh   laugh   but uhm ah but when i i  read i don't know how true this is but ah uhm i heard a kind of anecdotal story about eighteenth century jesuits in training in rome #> and uhm before they ah i guess i think there's a period called an initiate and before you actually become a priest become ordained as a priest you're still i guess uh in a sense a jesuit but an initiate  and uhm so there's sort of an anecdotal story about the this a kind of a prof or whatever who told his students you know uh like sometime before the ordination was due to take place the students had you know been fairly successful in their courses  the the prof advised them to go out and you know buy a hooker in the streets back streets  of rome so that they would know something about human sexuality if they didn't already because it would help in their uhm   and they should deal with that part of their character whatever kind of you know sexuality they had because it would make them a better priest in the end  before they were quite ordained   before they actually became priests  because once be becoming  becoming a priest there's no uh there're  no one asks you uh if you've ever gotten laid  before   uh huh   it's just they ask you they they ask you  to take a vow of celibacy  hmm hmmm  and uhm  which unless you're married it was a sin anyway to get a   multiple words   but ya a much a much lesser  one really a much lesser one  than breaking the vows of celibacy  well yeah i think so ya  although you know to read medieval to  read read some types of documents from early modern europe you get the impression that priests were always uh you know  at the time of the the name  council uhm uhm there seems to have been this concern that priests everywhere were co-habiting with women and stuff like this  and so uh the the church authorities the catholic church authorities roman catholic authorities were often uhm you know uh kept   prohibiting this kind of stuff  uh huh  so the fact that they were prohibiting this stuff suggests that they thought it was occurring  uh huh  it's kind of difficult to say i guess how uhm sorta sort of bad priests were by the  by the the standards of the church hierarchy so  uh huh 
Canada	 oh that sounds hmm  and todd is doing this in newfoundland  mhhm   was it a pilot project do you know  mhhm   federal or provincial funding  federal   hmm  federal i think  hmm  well i

running on the off days  cos we're just doing it four times a week word   four times a week is still quite a lot   so   but i'd like to do it off days  but he says you know and ah and i think he's right every day doesn't allow your body to recouperate  it is it's true   you shouldn't and supposedly like when i was with  johnny he was very into working out and all that he said a good way to do it was like three days one day off two days day off three days day off two days day off     cough   oh three days on  three days on one day off two days on one day off  three days on one day  right   hmm  so its like five out of seven  because you do have to let your body rest because your performance will be that much de uh less   you know if you you know  if you don't allow your body to recuperate  mhh hmm     well if you're permanently tired it doesn't work   ya you don't do as m as good  a workout  mhhm  cough   but i've yet to to feel that  rush and that feeling after i finish and

sometime she called me just to uhm just tell me that uh she didn't get that job that she had applied for  hmm  i think she was a little bit bummed out  but   ya i think she was too   cough   what a   probably because of the language thing  ya  but i mean i don't know you guys are getting a lot of call backs  i think something's gonna going to fall out  gosh darn it i hope so  something's gonna going to fall out ya  mhh  no but i b i don't think th   i don't think there's been any place that you've been refused an interview period  words   i didn't get an interview for the one that rosanne got turned down for  oh really  but i also didn't  usually i call back and make an effort  this one i   didn't make any effort cos i knew  rosanne wanted it   lay down   edie lay down   get down on the fl  floor   lay down   it didn't seem fair to me that i knew rosanne wanted and then i was gonna going to  get pushy     cough   that wouldn't be right  mhhm   and its hard to kinda kind of go off in different directions   i mean you're both using ellen eh as your   reference  mhhm   not as a reference no  no but i mean she's she's   kinda kind of screening you onto other things  i mean she's   mhhm mhhm  did you ever talk to what's her name uhm sher  er from uh resources at the u a p university affiliated program   oh starts with an e  erin murphy   no i didn't  i haven't heard anything from her either  i really don't  like i know i should have but  like i know what the answer's gonna going to   be  you need french and i don't have french  no but i mean for batshaw you don't need  you don't need that high of a level   mhh   batshaw was on the news today  what were they saying  uh the government had suggested that they cut their  budget by six percent and batshaw responded by saying they honestly couldn't do it  they di like it'd be a huge blow to cut it by six percent  hmm   and they didn't offer any thing as an alternative   no  cos queen elizabeth did it yesterday  i think they're the first hospital or whatever to  to actually come forward and and  offer an alt alternative   like cos they were one of the nine hospitals that were  gonna going to be cut  mhh hmm   and they've offered an incentive or kind of   a a more cost efficient uhm framework that uh  will basically integrate a c l s c centres locaux de services communautaires health clinics as well as like twenty-four hour physician care as well as  ah an emergency service plus private ya into one facility  ha   phrase   to create a mega complex  really  hmm  gosh they worked that out pretty quickly  private physician offices and stuff and they're  all word in a  words   hmm   cough   to keep the hospital open and keep the necessary services still there  yup  because they're saying i mean they're saying   transfer everything to the c l s cs but the c l s cs can't handle what they've got already so   no i know   hmm you know  and do you know what any like  have you heard any of the response for it  no nope no  so who are you talking to at batshaw that said that they were hit with  oh you said it was on the news   i saw it on the news  anyway you can call cindy and find out what's going on with it  cindy called me today actually cos i was supposed to go and meet with her tomorrow to get my evaluation but she doesn't have it finished  so i have to go she's going to phone no  i'm supposed to phone her tomorrow to re schedule  hmm  humming   actually i kind of miss working there  i didn't think i would but i do  have you run into any clients on the street  ya  did you  what did they say  yesterday i ran into uhm one of my  one of the kids i was working with  she ignored me completely  that's gonna going to be a normal  reaction   ya that's right   that's gonna going to   be a normal response when you run into clients  ya  mhhm  no that's what i expected  and i was actually kind of happy about that too  i wasn't in a good mood so i didn't laugh feel like talking  ya  no you're either gonna going to get two responses  you're either gonna going to get them to completely ignore you or you're gonna going to get them screaming from across a crowded room to get your attention  or they're gonna going to be very angry   well there's one client who i'm quite worried   laugh uh no i keep thinking about  bobbie anne bobbie anne sherman   well no well i'm not i'm not i'm not  speaking derogatorily i'm just saying that   derogatorily   isn't that right  words   i'm not sure   anyway   sniff no i mean look at bobbie anne   i'm not sure   that's funny   i mean bobbie anne was one of the secretaries that we had when i was working at the canadian mental health association  she was manic depressive and when her lithium levels were off  she'd go into a manic phase  and when she was manic i mean you couldn't give her enough typing  i mean she'd just laugh the pages   were flying off the typewriter   that's great   ya  the rest of the year she was  unfortunately the higher the manic phase went the lower she became after the two words   really  ya ya  it's such a dreadful   it's polar extreme highs extreme lows  it must be extremely frightening to go through  mhh  edie do you want to go outside  i'm back to this magazine that rob   gave me  go on   go on  well then in ya come  sit down  the magazine you gave me   there was an article written by uhm uhm someone who's not 'who' suffers from depression  cough   cough not manic depression but depression   so it's clinical depression  ya  and describes a bit you know just the very s   very superficial way what what a person living with depression uhm can expect  it's quite something you know it's   i think it's really frightening  the views of the mind  mhh  one friend who talks about it all the time  and she like how she describes it is really terrifying  ya   mhh   is she on prozac all the time now or is is is  is it kind of an on off  she's actually not on it right now  does she notice a big difference when she goes off it  i notice a big difference laugh when she goes off it  really  how   mh hmm   like is it just subtle things or  no they're actually really drastic things uhm  and she's tot totally  unaware of it  no she's pretty aware of it actually but she tends to downplay it 
Canada	 when she's on the prozac she's much more s  steady and she doesn't have some of the episodes that she does when she's not on it  what do you mean by episodes  you mean   she has episodes of like wanting to kill herself or to hurt herself  and she says she could be sitting in a lecture or sitting at a table with a group of people or whatever and have these images going through her head of how she can hurt herself  and images of herself hurting herself like cutting herself  she says particularly gouging out parts of her body  huh   and just different ways of killing herself  she says she just obsesses over the idea of suicide  has she ever   she can't get to sleep at night because that's all she can think about   has she ever self-mutilated or anything like that  so she's never gone that far  she could she's she has she has   cough   not with ah another object  like not with a knife or a razor blade or anything like that but she will purposely go anorexic and that's another way of self  for self-mutilation   hmm   and what does uhm words   has she has she ever been hospitalized  how long   no  she's had it since she was a kid too  like she was four or five  when she first started mh hmm   she used to have images  don't tell her any of this stuff  uhm she used to have uhm like she has some memories of like when she was five six having sh   convinced herself that she had planted bombs or mines in their garden and that if somebody stepped on it  like on purpose to kill people  and that she'd planted them and she couldn't get them out but she was going to kill  like it was going to kill  and she use to have fantasies about killing her parents in particular  hmm  or that somebody was trying to kill her  uhm that there was poison in her food  what's her   there are so many variations of uh mental illnesses and they they all have similar uhm  like uh feeling   they they all seem to follow the same    pattern or ya but have variations you know  path   same pattern   people experience it differently  but then again there's there are classic cases i think as well eh  ya  depression or  i think uh hers is pretty classic case of depression  though i'm surprised that it's taken so long for somebody to actually  she's seen a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists in her past but  no one's ever sort of diagnosed her  well i don't think they're very quick to to  diagnose childhood depression  i mean ah it's not a   i mean that that's a good thing in my mind in one sense because i mean she was kind of able   but you know what she never got the help that she needed either  ya but she was also able to kind of avoid all the labelling that was associated with it you know when she was growing up  but she was labelled as the trouble  troublesome child a lot of the time mhh   and sh that caused a lot of problems  and she was labelled as being ill but just not having and but that it was her fault   ya   is her brother the same  that it was she was causing it rather than having any kind of recognition that this was a sickness  it was like she was purposely causing other people problems and    pain   this was this was  the sickness that was self-inflicted or  hmm   ya   but it was totally self-inflicted and inflicted to hurt the people around her and that it was selfish and  self-oriented and things like that  mh hmm   mhh   so cos she was never kind of given any kind of validation about it  right  that maybe she actually did have something real  her brother never grew up in the same  because they're twins eh so there was nothing  no he was act actually   she i think a lot of a lot of   her problems have been out there uhm the family comparison  like her father's quite domineering and uhm s  like that extreme patriarchal figure  hmm  and her brother actually her twin brother is the golden boy  he could never do anything wrong in her father's eyes  and he's extremely successful  he's basically everything that maria says she's not  ya but she's succeeded herself in i mean every other way   ya  did uhm uh so are those relationships like those relationship dynamics still playing themselves out  like what's  ya a lot  really  a lot  so her her trips home aren't relaxing words   no she doesn't go and stay with her family   or just not with her parents  her father in particular causes her a lot of problems  hmm  she can't handle it   wow  or doesn't want to that much  so   edie do you want to go outside  i'm not gonna going to   do you want to let her out   edie out you go  go on outside   i have to have this last cookie   she's just gonna going to want to come in again in a second   has timmy gone out again since uh  no   no   won't let her  she tries  she's always three words   she complains  i'll give you that   words max   i feel so sorry for him  ya  edie get out  has he been popping laugh screens again  just the one time   no i leave that window o o  open enough for him  how's how's your apartment holding the heat like   it's not bad  it's not great  mind you it hasn't really been all that hot yet t   cos it was last year around this time of year that i remember calling you and you guts were in the middle of it   and i was dying   ya  you said max wasn't even handling it well  was this on de roche  mh hmm de roche was terrible for the heat  did they ever move that garbage   they had no ventilation  did they move that garbage out from underneath the bedroom window or did it stay there all summer  all summer  it was repulsive   huh  had did you ever hear  it it was macy 's friends  it wasn't yours  who who was the one that was going on the exchange program  one was going to texas wasn't he and the other was going to uhm   word   hmm   the other two stayed here  okay  ron and jim stayed here the other one  went away  what was his name  todd   no i don't think  matt   oh i don't remember now  i don't remember but i don't think i ever really met him  but had he not also done an exchange program in europe at one point  no idea  no idea  were they who was it for my birthday  in february   hmm  who was it that came up for my birthday in february  who came out for your birthday  ya   there was someone here  macy brought someone  it was a friend and his girlfriend or something or two friends from  it was at christmastime uh and it was at  no and uh  macy 's place   was it christmas   at my place   oh was it at your  ya okay it was at your place  there was a she had a few friends stay ouch laugh a few friends staying   ya   there was mary sheila  karen sherry i think that's it  and then ron and jim both came for that time too  cough   who was the one karen was kind of fixated on  jim   ya  was he the younger of the two  they're the same age   ya   well   the summer's upon us and hopefully the maritimes will be  as welcoming as it's it has been known  to be in the past  mh hmm   it has been gosh i have high expectations now  well you shouldn't have too high expectations  but uhm if you are in halifax and you want to see something beautiful peggy's cove is certainly a place that is manageable from halifax and worth you're worth seeing it's worth it's worth paying to see peggy's cove   mh hmm   i'd love to see it  ya well   words your friends and make it down there  it's too bad you couldn't make it over to the island  prince edward island too because uhm prin   prince   p e i prince edward island   ya  because the confederation centre has some really neat theatre   all summer long  mhh   and i mean even just to see anne of green gables it's worth it  oh  ya  like we went one year   i've only been to the island three times  four times   really   nice production word too   and uh but i've always been impressed  the groom from the wedding i'm going to is from p e i  what part   just outside of charlottetown  or i think actually right in charlottetown  ya okay  the uhm  what time is it  uhm it's quarter to nine  it's gonna going to be late taking the dog out for a walk  i don't know are you planning on going  i don't word   are you interested in going for a walk with  edie bring that back   i don't know   bring me my shoe  oh my gosh laugh   come on   bring it here  bring it here  she's looking pretty happy with herself with  that shoe in her mouth  ya you give me that   words   well she wants to go out  is that it  well ya she has she hasn't gone out since this morning  and she knows that usually after we eat that's the time we go  right girl   so uhm  pretend like you're still eating  ya  edie lay down on the floor  lay down  the tea seat   ya   we're attached laugh which makes it  quite ah quite good for us  does amy know uhm like amy 's  not going to this wedding at all eh  laugh no she doesn't know any of them  she's not connected at all  she's no  these are friends from  no thanks  just black   uh she's these are friends not from university  they're from like where i home  where i live  caledon   bolton area actually  bolton   i'm from caledon they're from bolton  is is is the caledon you're from  the same funding is it the same funders as uhm   mh hmm  really  ya  do you know the funding people  i think so  oh really laugh   i think so  it's kept under wraps  like it's not really talked about that much who they are  isn't that something  thank you  so what is it that it be i mean i know you don't really know who they are but what is it that you think is kind of motivating them to make such substantial   the uh well ter terry   terry said that it was because the  the funders were interested in social  social issues and wanted more research sort of things to be done   unbiased research  mh hmm  but they were quite aware that that doesn't really happen within the government and that it would have to be from the outside  ya   well what was their connection with tim   like did they know him personally  i don't think so  i think they probably knew his work cos he did a lot of consult like like terry   a lot of like freelance consulting social policy work  hmm  and uhm so they're they they  fund the benington institute but they don't have any say in what's being researched or the direction it's going to take  and that's right in the contract is that they have no say in the work that's being done  so basically they would provide the core funding that provides for the rent the salaries and that's it  ya   mhh hmm  and then everything else is  holy  they must be putting in a substantial amount of money because  tim and terry don't come cheap  well but they also do get they get paid   for the people who ask them to do contracts  like they do contract work and other people contract them out like contract for them   so they get money in as well  like they are it's not totally  non   huh   well it's non-profit i suppose but it's like   it does reciprocate like   it's not entirely funded by this caledon   family   right 
Canada	 that's a really big and gawky one though i think we should try to sell that one  yeah that's true   yeah  true  but this is this is a neater one  two words glass   come on  come on out  yeah   yeah  words i remember word the red speaker far away from mic laugh   word they painted it that colour two or three words   hey did you give maeve that  uhm  i don't know  i may have  i think you did give her one once   yeah it's entirely possible i did   uhm  she had another one  uh i think you did give her that one  mm  uh so you might as well keep it as a spare  mm   it's a nice one  this also makes me think that you did give it to her  yeah  no yeah   it's uh nice soft leather  yeah  yeah um probably   okay these you also gave to her didn't you these little glass things  i yeah i   was it those or these or what  no  ah she had these  these were little dessert things but these are the stuff  these are the these are the  dishes   yeah ya yeah   yeah those   yeah well i see there's two different ones actually  these are two different things   no i recall  but but these are the ones she always wanted for stuff in the fridge  remember  well yeah there're things like this  they were there were the little pa  they were the little pyrex bowls  so so do you want them in fact   but we have little pyrex bowls you know  but they can be used for uhm uh cr&egrave;me caramel   oh  i'm sure you make it every night  yes  laugh   yeah  okay do you want this for a phone  uhm  no i think it would just be uh effectively it would just clutter things up  just clutter laugh   yeah   laugh just clutter things clutter things up  laugh   yes three or four words   okay so i can probably sell this  what's this   yes mm hmm  or maybe i'll keep it myself  yeah well if you wish you can  uh well what is this   okay so   that  what these are and i dunno don't know  why they're so squashed maybe we could start anew  these are the candlestick things off the lamp   oh   now when i had i had that lamp repaired  mm mm  and one of these was missing when it came back and the guy gave me this to make another one up  i dunno don't know what that is   i dunno don't know how these got squashed  they can probably probably be ironed out  mm hmm mm   uh and i've got uhm  wall wallpaper   i was al always for  maeve i was always going to put some of the wallpaper on like up in the hallway cos i thought it would look quite attractive  so if you want that   yeah but see the difficulty with that  is that anything like this uh which is papered it gets too hot  will burn  well it's totally away from the light  mm word   it was on them mart   it it   yeah yap   no no i know  word   it had it had that  cream coating   many two words   yeah exactly  no  so you might want to i dunno don't know you might have to start over again  okay   yeah  this little elastic band you can probably use  yes  we always end up not having enough elastic bands  uhm  okay  okay e   this iron  mm hmm  you don't need an iron  no we don't need an iron but i could use   the uh the the   word   well we might as well keep it   the stand  the stand  oh really  yeah  you don't have one   yeah   no we don't have a stand  okay we'll put this with the kids'   no   it's a heavy iron as well   well this is it  i know   but but  nonetheless uhm   i know this kind of iron myself intimately  i even learned how to sh   shirts do my shirts at the age of seven or something  laugh   ohhhhh age of seven   mm no i no this no i had   one like this and i sold it off as a uhm  yeah okay   you know   well we'll put it over there   so no i think it can go no i think it can go out   oh really  yeah i think it can go  oh uhm   patented nineteen fifty-one  ha  i should i clean this up  e cos that can be cleaned up can't it  mmm i wouldn't use anything on it   no  no  do you think it's   feel it   it's quite smooth  eeeeh it looks funny though doesn't it  no one or two words   okay how much  i th it's in good shape  yeah i know  uhm  well we irons i think are around about thirty dollars now  so probably   well yeah but they've gotten hi-techy  no i know  four dollars   no   what were you thinking  i i dunno  don't know   i thought you'd want to keep it for the kids  no no  i mean consider  irons in fact are a lot more than thirty dollars now  irons are one thing that for some reason have gotten a lot more expensive   hmm   it may be because you have one or two words  they're not my thing  uh so they're not that cheap to buy   hmm  yeah but the next uh half dozen years minimum   probably next ten years it would just be sitting around doing nothing except rusting   h   yeah that's true true true true true   ah right  okay so what we're selling this   yeah  no uh when i came uh came down  here uhm i got one   i got one given to me   hah and uhm clears throat yes  mm  okay   do you want this laugh   no no   laugh   i doubt that i can get rid of it  it bring doesn't say 'brings' back no memories to me  no  no me neither  i i don't think i can get rid of this actually  no  you could give it away  yes long, slow 'eee' uhm   there might be someone out there who would be willing to take it   do you need do you have to put   your kettle at work on anything  no no word   it can be used just as a hot thing  you know a hot   yeah i know uh what we're using right now is a retrieved copy of uh instructions for instruction manuals for the lotus one two three version one   well you could use this  yeah but we're using something else which is highly acceptable  okay  here's a couple of underwear shirts  do the kids wear underwear shirts ever  no  no i didn't think so  no  no  no  okay uhm i'll put that with the clothes  there's a bunch of clothes a which are upstairs  mm  i decided i would try to sell uh a lot of the clothes   rather than just shipping them off to the salvation army  mm yeah   no reason why not   mm mm   i went down to neighbourhood services to see what they   charge   mm did i tell you that uh jan tolstoy  uhm john smith's wife ex-wife and uh beatrice lindstrom both gave a donation to the uh salvation army  oh did they  yeah there was a uhm letter came through from uh salvation army saying that they one or two words   so i phoned them up and uh thanked them very much  oh how nice   oh  and you know   yeah a friend of mine didn't know that we had s you know say the salvation army and gave ah a contribution to the cancer society  oh  yes  oh  and i'm still getting letters  i got four letters this week  oh  laugh yes laugh   it's amazing laugh   yeah well   laugh   yeah it's in fact i had uhm sent out the information about uh you know the service and stuff  yeah   i think i sent it to anthea ledonne a little bit late and i thought well i don't think she can go herself  yeah  so i considered and i thought well i will send it also to  alwoods   mm hmm  and i'll say r you know i i   didn't want to look like i was trying to drum up business kind of so i sent it to them and said you know i thought that perhaps you would like to uhm  uh b i said i i don't think  anthea ledonne can get around on her own and i thought therefore that perhaps you would like to take her  mm hmm  i had a call monday or tuesday night from anthea   now that was the first time that i'd heard from her  you know cos i had written her twice  mm hmm   mm hmm   first of all when maeve was still  in the hospital and then immediately after she died  mm hmm   mm hmm  she's sounding fantastic  she was eighty-seven on just around the time  she was eighty-seven just around the time maeve died  mm hmm  she sounds great  she says she is fine  you know she sounded the same as ever really but th she has problems  walking and can make it out from her front door to a cab  yeah mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  but then she said bryn takes her around places  anyway i think although she didn't say it that dave alwood had gone over to see her  alwoods would you believe are moving to clearwater b c to a twenty-acre farm or something  ah yes  and  huffs and they're going to b   become farmers at age what seventy-five   intake of breath uhm  so then i had a i had   as you sow so shall ye reap  anyway yeah   i had ah a nice little note from chandra  oh indeed  yes this week   a charming note   pardon  a charming note  a charming note  her name is actually chandreya   yes   chandreya not chandraya   yeah i know   yeah i know maeve always uh  maeve always called her chandrey and  uh   word   no she called her chandra   well she called her chandra but you know when she called her   something formalized her name was   i think i think  word called her chandra   anyway  anyway uhm they she uh she  mentioned that they were going and so forth and that they had given my letter to blockmans   oh  now blockmans are the people who bought the house  yeah  and blockmans apparently will go  oh  so ah presumably they'll take anthea  because they know anthea you know  they used to live next door to anthea   ya   so laugh   oh did they live nor next door   next door yeah  immediately to the uh  to the north   or to the south  yeah   yes yes yes immediately to the north   okay in uh what's her name's place  kalynchuk's   no  the other side  yeah ya   you see so they've known anthea for  many many years  ya   oh  so anthea may go and i guess blockmans will be there  well you see she did write to maeve for a  few years and then maeve stopped writing cos she thought well  nat probably didn't want to  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   so   and i finally   and well this is one of the reasons why i   think there should be some sort of an announcement  a few words   finally   well i i think i think  we've uncovered everyone except for perhaps lords   really  mm   finally i heard from candy and rosalyn   mm hmm  uh they didn't say they'd be away  but then uh kind of odd cos she said oh let us know about uh what arrangements you've made for edmonton  mm   so maybe they're thinking of coming   they may uh okay   yeah  uh don't five or six words   uh yes okay these n  these are uhm clears throat the uhm  greek ones aren't they  okay   aren't these the ones you got in greece for maeve  th they're wool uhm   they're wool covers for cushions  mm   mmmmmm   yeah i may have gotten something uhm   what i recall getting   yes yes these are the ones word  i recall getting a a poof  footstool   yes yes you got the poof  but these i'm sure you got these uh in greece  mm hmm   mm hmm  uh i was thinking that they would be quite attractive downstairs in your basement  yeah stuffed on the wall  well drawn out 'weee' sound you could put them on the wall or make cushions out of them  true true   they would go with the uh sofa   mm hmm  so  with the futon  would you like them 
Canada	 like that's where the original funding came from and sort of to keep it at a level i'm sure that they do  but they do get money from the contracts they do as well  hmm  at least i assume they do cos often they do the contracts for  a certain agency  mh hmm  so this family that is contributing towards this institute is also the founder of this town that you're from  no   or   they just   they just they uhm  moved the family  i'm not even sure if the family who i think it is is but makes sense but uhm they just moved there   and they have huge prop property  like huge amount of property there   huge  hmm  they're not exactly suffering from their  provision of  funds   so have they   so what is in caledon the town  like what   what is in caledon  the town of caledon  well   like do they have an i g a grocery store  do you have like a a co-op store  do you have like  they have four corners   there is one street light   on one corner there's a post office and a becker's   one corner there's the gas station   one corner there's a a church and a little antique store  and on the other corner is a strip joint  laugh   cough   but that's just like the village of caledon  the town of caledon is actually includes a bunch of other like areas  the town of caledon is like is regional  there's a region  ya  so there's also like  caledon-east is in caledon erin belfountain inglewood cheltenham  so is there   there's all these tiny little towns all  kind of   mhh hmm   it's a hu huge   like it's quite a large area   so there's no real industrial area  there's no real business sector  there's no real  farming   that's it  farming  school  it's a also it's a commuter area  like a lot of people  it's like estates people in subdivisions   a bedroom community of larger  centres  pardon   it's a bedroom community or   ya for toronto mostly  and maybe some guelph  but st t t a two-hour commute   one  just over one   oh i s oh oh ya ya ya  is that what your dad does  everyday   and he's never grown tired of it  oh i think he gets pretty laugh tired of it  mhh  he always goes in before the traffic  so he leaves the house at about five everyday  and he works late  and he   he gets home at about nine ten at night  he works way too hard  mhh mhh mhh   that's like a seventeen hour day laugh   ya  way too hard   well dinner  dinner  laugh   ya so what should we do  what should we about that   do you have a car  uhhhh somehow doubt it but then again i don't really know  mm kay okay   what do you have in mind  well i was just thinking you know if there was a car in the picture then we'd have a bigger broader base to choose  from   mh hhm   laugh ya that's true  if not then we have a narrower base  laugh   then we're stuck out in n d g  notre-dame-de-gr&acircumflex;ce   do you like uhm pasta casareccia   what's that  it's at draper and sherbrooke  oh ya oh ya  that's a great idea  that's not bad  sure  you know  ya  and uh  that's a good idea  okay  it's within reach and   okay   good  ya word   and i think they sell wine  yes they do  but if you want a cocktail i don't think they have cocktails  no i think that wine is great  wine is fine  i'll take laugh i'll take it   laugh good laugh that's good   and then do you  is that okay  yes no that's fine  okay   yes no that's just perfect  good okay  oh well g god that was easy laugh   that was fast   now what are we going to do the other fifty-five minutes  ya really yoi yoi  are you wearing sunblock  you're getting you're getting like i was and then i realized that i was getting too much sun on my  i noticed when you bent down to get you had  sun on the back of your neck word   there's too much sun  well ya  it is possible  i didn't have sunblock today but i  didn't expect to be outside  word man   ya   ya  it's amazing isn't it  i i just walking home each afternoon i noticed how intense the sun is on the back of my neck  i mean at four o'clock in the afternoon  right here   ya  i mean i'm not looking good   but i have been so i started wearing it  yup   no i guess i should  angie 's a fanatic about it  i i should i should take her cue  ya   pays to be a real sunbunny  i i love lying in the   s sun   oh me too   i just loved to lie  soak it up   it made me feel like a human being   oh me too  uh ah it still does  ya i know  you know  ya  god when we were

uhm ya we just decided that's it  we really wanted to really do a vacation  go somewhere different   mh hmm   totally different mindspace  and we had planned to go to california the year before and i  like put the brakes on it sort of at the last minute  oh ya   just decided that either time money everything it was just not the right time for me  not good   ya  huge disappointment  well these things happen though  no absolutely  ya  and then so then the next year we said no let's do it  and we really wanted to go to like san fransisco and stuff  mhh  but then on the other hand we thought well you know but  we could just go lie at the beach  you can't do that in san fransisco   no no   that's   that's a whole other thing  like laugh   and   a whole other thing   so that's it we went  and uh she lives in this one of these like totally california apartments complexes like atriums   but whereabouts did you did you go to like   san diego  oh okay san diego ya ya ya  ya ya  did you go to venice and any of the other little  places around or did you pretty much  stay in san diego   well   we play pray stayed   pretty much in san diego   ya   we went up to uhm well then amy and i left for a few days   we went up to laguna beach which is an artist   well artists' colony resort kind of area  mhh hmm  and we stayed in this amazing little hotel  ahh  it was from the thirties  wow  that was really really something  with all like these gardens and little apartments that are all on different levels  and like totally like you feel like you're in uhm in  wh in europe really  i mean it's like more like a  anyway it was great  mhh mhh  and uh and uh what's her name's apartment is like you know one of these sort of atrium ones where it's more like a motel laugh than an apartment

pictures laugh because  if you're not wearing a bikini you're not suckin  sucking it in  laugh   let's put it that way laugh   ya that's right  that's true   i was done  you're up for the theatre if you've got a bikini on  let me tell you  ya   for sure ya  ya  it was really funny laugh   so that was uh it was great   it was really great  ya   i i can't remember a more relaxing really relaxing time  getting on the plane coming home i felt really like yes this is good i'm ready for whatever the next thing is  mhhm   and i didn't have that kind of hysteria  ya   we stayed long enough  like sometimes it's too short and i have this hysteria just before i'm coming home  it's like no i don't want to come home   i'm not ready   i'm not ready  i was ready  it was like okay that's fine  laugh   ya  it was good  it was very good   hmm   ya   so then what was that topic laugh   well we just started we just got on   to the behaviour thing   the sun   the sun right  gee my memory  i don't have a memory actually  i don't have one   laugh   don't even ya  no   you know what my short-term memory is like  laugh   zero  oh ya no no   it seems i mean i just it's amazing what i forget   you're living in the moment the here-and-now   ya this exact moment not the one that had  just went by ten seconds ago   that's right that's right   and tomorrow when somebody says what did you do yesterday  i haven't a clue   laugh exactly  that's what i say  exactly  i don't know  no no i know  when people monday morning i'd come here you know and uh eh everybody who works like all week that's what they always ask you  what did you do on the weekend  no clue  you know what that's so good  that's really great   laugh   like none  oh thank god you're as bad as i am  because i i just don't remember that stuff and and and it's embarassing sometimes cos you think this person must think i'm really out of it  mhh senile  like you're trying to answer but it's like you don't really remember and so you you're  speaking slowly  mhhm   well i li i   maybe it'll come back  no no   i think it doesn't  no i know  no i was like laugh i hear what you mean  no  i'm reading ehm microserfs right now  oh right ya  it's really funny   it's really funny because it's it's  all about that whole thing about being either bodies or  machines  and you know that whole question   mhhm mhhm   and the whole idea about memory as well  mhhm  and sort of what the difference between what memory is  for us and what memory is if you're a computer and  you know where these are similar and where they are different  obviously   mhhm   mhhm   and it's pretty interesting  hmm  it's pretty interesting 
Canada	 and i'm reading the book uhm that one of the books from from the uh stash that i took from your place   pile laugh   i relieved you of a quarter of your bookshelf  laugh   uhm and i can't think of her name cos i don't have a memory  and i can't think of the title of the book  anita brookner   yes  a start in life  ya  how did you know i would start with that one  ah i'm ahhh cheek click   i s i i looked through a couple of them  i started reading them i thought no i'm gonna  going to save that one  this one i'm gonna going to wait  uh uh this one nuh  and then i picked that one up and that one just seemed just right for right now  mhhm  ya  are you liking it  ya  neat eh   ya ya   it's very interesting like characters  huh really   the m mother   her mother is  that character's great  oh ya  oh i really oh i'm glad   i'm glad you picked that one  ya ya  she's written a lot of things too   like if you like that there's other things that'll be   ya i can go and find her elsewhere   ya   absolutely  ya  absolutely  well i'm really i really was onto canadian authors for a long time and so i forgot what else was out there   so i've been kind of you know trying to  broaden my   thing again  ohh   uhh   at least that's a good thing  ya  i mean to like have done the canadian author thing  ah   aye   that's a good thing  ya ya  i don't i i haven't really i mean my whole thing was when ahh when   i left andrew and all of that stuff it was like suddenly   the i all i wanted to do was read women   i i'd never really read women before  like never  maybe you know margaret laurence or something but  mhhm  and then at one point i thought well you know maybe i should broaden my horizons laugh again you know  get out of this whatever   ya   so  ya  ya i i i read trash and i read uhm  you know highbrow stuff and i like it all  i'm not i i   1 like stephen king and i like true crime and   all those kinda kind of things  oh ya   what's true crime   that was you were talking about that the  other day   ya true crime is uhm real murders that have occurred  real unsolved mysteries et cetera you know   right   uhh real people who are actually dead as a result of a crime  but like uh   laugh uhm   ya sorry  serial killer kinda kind of stuff or  serial killers or sorta sort of infamous killers for whatever reason  okay   uhm or people that certainly weren't in the media  that i was aware of be because the crimes happened elsewhere but you know  things that have or or happened in another decade when i wasn't aware of it  okay   but i f there i it's  really interesting the uh how how a writer will tackle the whole thing in terms of uhm where do they position themselves  mhhm   uhm how do they try to create a context for the crime in terms of it's social impli  implications   mhh hmm   uhm if they're good writers they're good writers no matter what they're writing about  and so you know the the portraits that  that ap appear can be  v very like really   riveting  sure   uh is there a level that where they try to explain it  they get into the psychology of the killer  okay  always you have to i mean otherwise it would be three pages long  ya   right   oh ya just the plot  ya   right   right   but uhm uh again women women who commit the murders  i'm sort of very interested in that  always have been   ahhh really  ya  really  ya  so i i always look for new ones that i  haven't haven't read  uh huh  because i read uhm i guess it was the late seventies or the early eighties women who kill   uh that sounds familiar  so an uh american uh writer  anyway she uhm she did this sort of very interesting kind of historical look at uhm lizzie borden and uhm   oh yes okay   cough women i mean   she really re she did incredible research cos she was looking at stuff that you know was in the sort of annals of history but uh documented uh you know obscure cases in massachusetts and like during the eighteenth century or seventeenth century  i know   and uhm these occurrences of men dying in the household and and and no record of   you know why except that they just had you know  a a little   s smell   and and went away  right   laugh   spat   and so you know the whole thing about the arsenic  uh  small doses of arsenic uh on a regular basis  hmm   right   ya   and but she she  selected certain cases studies and they were really interesting because   they most of them weren't sensational  and i think the lizzie borden one was the most familiar   ya that's pretty ya   and uhm you know and   she she begins to draw in all kinds of stuff around uh the his history  and and and everything else and wh   why these women were trying to bump off their husbands at certain points in time  ya   uhm you know and give  give given given the social uhm environment  and okay   so each one somehow represented a historical  moment  and extended from that something   ya   ya ya ya   ya like the jilted lover for example  when women uhm had to be married to have any kind of   of a social standing and were promised marriage and then the guy does whatever  right   oh god yes   he leaves or whatever  right   and she just stalks him and she ends his  life because she is furious because her life has been  destroyed   she has right   right she has no future or any   ya so it it was just very very interesting for all of those other kinds of things  and sort of the social trends of the time and how  eventually in the uhm  ya oh   there was a period of time when   when these sentences were very very light simply because they couldn't believe that a woman had it within her nature to kill  huh   and so they would look at every other conceivable excuse that they could in order to not acknowledge that she was able  to ah you know commit an act of violence  well that's interesting though   right  > and so that so those  </} trends speak so much about so many ot her things in terms of our own justice system and the social mores et cetera et cetera  sure   so it was very interesting  and so once i did that i found i was always picking up   out of the the pot the little  individual cases  interesting   really   and   ya ya  and i i have the really bad ones  like i mean the ones that aren't well- written and have no insight  i i throw them out after i  read them   ya some of them they must be just really   right   but i just chuck them  but but the ones that i found pretty interesting i've hung onto so  ya i've never really   you know i've never really been into like detective stories killing uh but i had for a long time and i probably still do to a certain degree a real thing when i was like mhh twelve to fifteen or so i would read anything about the mafia  oh ya  anything oh my god   that's interesting   but okay so why  what fascinated you about the mafia   i don't know  i ah well i think for one thing  the the just the organization of it  uhhm   like how it  laugh they were so well organized laugh    laugh well no laugh   what a fabulous model for society laugh   laugh   i think that model exists actually  i think it's called the patriarchy   laugh   the head honcho   no but i i was just stunned at how you know i don't know how   how things hung together and  or how people tried to keep things in line  mhhm   and or if it didn't and why not and that sort of   i don't know  i don't know what it was  i mean even now   well i mean it's that whole system of justice within their circles like they have is so  steeped in tradition  oh ya   and it's kinda kind of   the sicilian connection and i mean things that go back to  oh   but i just also just fascinated by the enormity of the networking of crime  mhhm  you know like that's not one person or you know a bunch of people that who get together and go do b and e's break and enters you know  it was like this is a huge vast network of crime  and this laugh fascinated me you know   mhhm   mhhm   and you know it would follow it would  it could cover so much terrritory you know from italy to new york to <[las vegas to you know  mhhm   and and you know it all it all fit in together somehow and i was like  this is   i mean as ah as much as it was scary  laugh i was like this really weird respect  for it laugh   ya   oh ya ya ya   exactly   laugh a really weird respect for it  ya ya  i don't know maybe it's those suits  i don't know laugh   ya i but i remember thinking this is really weird   eddie the weasel don don   i love that  i love the names   laugh   the nicknames  my horoscope this week is about uhm well he talks about how abori a  a aboriginal australian aboriginal  people and are given two names  one is their name that's used within the tribe and one is a sacred name that's never used and is never even told to the child  only the elders know it  hmm  and once you go through some major right of passage then you earn uh the right to know your sacred name and from that  f day forward you can use it   mhhm   okay  and uh so then he says you know we don't have this in our society but i suggest starting a new tradition and that this week you think of and give yourself a name that you will use when you are talking to yourself and no one else will know it   and laugh i love it   this could be dangerous laugh   laugh   i love it   i mean i already do that in a way  like i already have these kind of characters   personas or or whatever that i see myself in for various situations  mhhm mhhm   but but ya   so have you been thinking  sure  ya  i'm not telling you though laugh   oh no no i wouldn't ask  of course not   but it's fun because you can think of like you know sort of different aspects of yourself and whether a name for that aspect is going to be enough to be your sacred name  mhh hmm   like is it going to cover enough of your  that could drive you crazy  it's going to be great   it's going to be great   laugh   i figure i have a week to fig  figure it out because then you know my horoscope comes up next week laugh   laugh word you're getting in trouble word   laugh then i have to think up something else  laugh word laugh     the exercise for this week p  pick a sacred name  okay   ya pick a sacred name   put on your to-do list  laugh exactly  the to-do list  laugh that's laugh exactly laugh   put it up on the bulletin board  have you thought of your sacred name yet laugh   laugh only two more days   that's right  i think i actually already have one  i think i already have it cos i sort of  it's interesting i was reading i got  the fiction issue of new yorker and in it they have this year they've decided to include journals of different writers  hmm  so i think it's sort of fun  well ya  and one of the people a a  writer i'm not familiar with talked about how he came to writing or began to really kind of expand his notion of writing 
Canada	 he said he began to uh write to himself in the third person in his journal and i guess obviously began to get a sense of like ah what a character is or a   mm hmm mmm mh hmm   that's interesting  you know  ya  because it allows you that distance to kind of   sort of make it up  ya ya   ya   i can see that  ya   ya   ya  course you know my first twelve years of my diary are all made up anyway laugh   are they   did you make them up   oh some of it is   oh that's great   oh my god   that's great  i think that's part of why the reason why  i threw them out laugh   i went back and read them i'm going this isn't true at all  but it must have been at the time  did you think it was true at the time or were you entertaining yourself by just writing   which is  okay too i guess laugh   ya ya huh  i well i th i don't know   that's a really good question  i don't know if i thought they were   i don't know  i don't know if i thought i was fooling myself or  whatever you know   hmm hmm hmm   but it's fascinating  it was fascinating when i went back and read it and i went it wasn't like that at all laugh   like at all laugh   wow  ya  so i figure i've already started practising the notion of the third person in words laugh   it's true   laugh oh dear   laugh scary eh eww eww ghost noises   no no no it's great  it's good  i guess  i guess   whatever it takes  i know  i guess that's the thing eh   i guess that's the thing  whatever it takes   you know i'm jus just   just listening to people going through their processes how they work creative processes it's it's   phenomenal  i mean that's why i love hearing uhm ya someone like timothy findlay talking about how how he works  uhm   ya   it's just great to   you know you you just think huh i'm not crazy  exactly   you understand   yup   exactly   he's as crazy as i am or vice versa  it's it's okay you know  ya   that's the hard   it's healthy  that's the hardest part i think though getting to that point where you just kinda kind of go well you know whatever it takes  it's so funny  i had lu lunch  breakfast with my friend moreen this morning and uh  she's a dancer  yes  and she's a pretty weird egg   oh ya  well sure  she's a dancer  well laugh   no no laugh   i hate it when people do that  she's an artist well what do ya you  expect   laugh   no she's a she's you know she's got her own way about her  mmm  and she was saying that she had gone to dinner  she and her husband had gone to dinner at a friends of her husband's house who   i mean we were all friends  like we were all this sort of group of choreographers working together  and uh since jo the other one has had a baby and stuff she's no longer dancing at all  like she has nothing to do with choreography at all  anymore  mmm   and uh and both irene  and i feel like we've kind of drifted away from her  and well you know whatever sometimes we commiserate about that  and and uhm and anyway they all had dinner and at one point jerry asked so like we never see karen  anymore  where where is she  what's she doing  and i and so she was telling me this   and uh and i said well what did you say  and she goes well i told them that you're sort of you know a strange bird and   and i went ha excuse me   laugh   like the tears just came to my eyes and i was just like well what do ya you mean  like  laugh   and she said oh i didn't say bird i said cat   laugh   oh alright laugh   look who's talking laugh   and and like but the biggest thing is i'm going wow this's really like got to me   you know like and uh i and she said well i mean i meant it in the best way  and you know and she went on to say that you know like i'm in writing and blah blah blah and everything  but i just kept looking at her going i can't believe you said that laugh   i said you know i write that in my diary all the time but it's another thing when i know that somebody else said it about me to  somebody else   ya ya   it's like and you're killing me laugh   ya ya i know  ya i i can  ya i see huh me huh  it was really funny  but afterwards you know then we were riding the bus and i said you know it's i mean it's true   it's true  i mean i am strange and different and all of that  stuff laugh   ya but then what's strange anyway  you know  exactly   everybody's strange then  exactly  every everybody's the same as far as i'm concerned  we just have different  different uh parts of it that  yup   wh wh i was thinking   about this the other day  like you're in a family right an   and you're you think you're the weird one in  the family because you're the artist and everyone else does you know other stuff that involves   you know nine to five jobs or something  and families ya   laugh this sounds strange   laugh okay   work   families and stuff   mm   so you know i've my path is gone  in another direction  but i don't think  well no i'm not going to dismiss myself that way  no exactly  i'm not i'm not the   the odd ball in the family because i'm an artist or because i've chosen to do this kind of work  i mean it's it's everybody's   doing what they do and that and  there's no tha i mean there's no difference to me in terms of you know you're you're each  doing what you do in your life  deep inhale   ya   i i've i mean i've  met people who you know can barely function and   doing what appears to be normal stuff  ya and i i mean i mean if you want to start making comparisons between strange people or people  who can't can't get dressed in the  morning then then   you're in you're incredibly normal   in in every every   sense of the word  laugh   right   ya it's funny eh  so to to be considered strange or  i mean i am considered st strange   i'm not considered  i don't know if people consider me strange  they would never say that to my face  laugh laugh   but they call me the artistic one   and i don't  know if that   right   in your family or   in my in my not in my immediate family   i mean they they know you know they  sort of have that but they also know that i'm all every  all these other things too  but my my larger family the people who don't see me except maybe at thanksgiving or whatever   oh i see what you're saying sure  and uhm you know i've always been that so i am in their eyes this kind of weird one  words   mm  and it's it's you know i'm not there's   nothing weird about me right   no   like what is weird  it's it's this is i i've just been thinking about this  it's ve very   it's a very strange uh  it's like that af after  that whole thing with michael jackson okay  mm mm  next day i'm sitting on the bus  there are these two women   one probably in her early forties  one in her early fifties   and the first person goes laugh well i mean just because they got up on that show and tried to pretend they're normal i mean they're not normal they're not normal  mm hmm  and i mean i i cou s i couldn't believe it  they're sitting there trying to tell us how normal they are  they're just not normal and that's not a normal marriage  i don't i'm sorry that's not a normal marriage  and and just prior to that i had heard the beginning of their conversation or the end of the other conversation which was all about the paul bernardo trial  now that that wasn't laugh  a normal marriage  laugh i think we could make that argument   laugh   and   laugh   and anyway then they started talking all about michael jackson and and you know i'm sorry but that make-up and everything  i mean this person he's not normal he's not normal  and at first i'm just kind of like discretely listening  trying to look out the window  but eventually i found them so fascinating that i turn and i just looked at them blatantly  i'm just looking at them going   you watched it ya  i watched it and i'm going and this is normal  ya   they want ya you want to know why they think that way  it's great eavesdropping  just to really   fascinating   ya ya  and then i thought and i also thought   well these are the kind of people who will sit there and  and you know just decide all sorts of things about whether so and so is normal or not normal or whatever  and i'm and i'm just sitting there going is it really so normal  like if they were me looking at them what would they see  mm hmm  and would they think that that's so normal  to be so completely involved in the lives of all these celebrity stories and celebrity trials and   mm hmm   and then on the other hand i had to go well i guess it is pretty normal because lots of people do it laugh   ya ya ya   and and i do it  i mean i love that junk   laugh   i i eat it up you know  i eat it up  it   but then that's that's one part  of of my life  it's all that's i find that all so confusing  all of that weird normal  uh you know that the  whole thing about  ya ya   mm   there's and there's that whole thing about mundane  i mean there's this whole sort of mundaneness to strangeness   and or fascination with strangeness and i was like ahhh laugh it's so weird  very weird  ya  well normal is a construction so i mean no one fits in  it's not possible  no   it doesn't exist  i mean if you're going to look at the institutions that we've established as being normal the family and i mean  it's all a construction   hmm   oh ya   have you ever seen the movie i think it's called a sweet life  no  it's uhm what's his name michael mike   uh shoot somebody from england  i think he uh   i'm trying to think of other movies that he did  he may have done like my beautiful laundrette  oh it he was in it or he wrote  it or directed it   the director   uh stephen frears  uh oh no  oh i know who you're thinking of  no   but i can't ever remember this guy's name  m mike lee mike  m mike ya it's something like that  he he does he does uhm  movies about about working class   brits   sort of   ya daily life brits   ya ya  often sort of quasi-improvised  ya  and my sweet life is an incredible movie for just  you're sitting there watching this completely you know relatively completely normal famliy and then there's this sort of one girl who has this eating disorder but laugh but but  like everybody looks strange  mm  you know but not like not like     i mean just strange just like affectionately weirdly strange  and familiar  mm mm   laugh   and i'm sitting there going boy he really captured something here  mm   he really captured something about how every family is strange  every family in some way or another  mm hmm  and with all their little quirks and you know  i don't know like what what they cover their teapots with or like just all the littlest things that make   every  single family strange in its own way  right   ya   ya   i thought it was really   or particular maybe   particular is maybe a better word  ya   ya  ya  ya   ya it was really interesting  anyway it was pretty strange to be told laugh that i was  strange by one of my best friends laugh who i think is pretty strange herself laugh   strange 
Canada	 did you tell her that   laugh   no i didn't actually say that  i should have  oh god  laugh   no it's it's it's to have  to find out how you've been described  ya i guess that's what it is  ya   ya  i never agree with that  ya laugh   laugh usually i find that  ya like there's a part of me that thinks well maybe she should have just said well i don't know call her  laugh you know  laugh if you really want to know  ya   ya   ya it was pretty funny  on the other hand you know i kind of was uh it was  kind of a one of those very revealing moments for myself  where i thought wow this has really touched a nerve  and i you know by the time i was   on the metro getting home i was just laughing to myself  mhhm   i thought oh my god they must think i'm crazy  laugh   strange bird   laugh i guess i'm just staying at your place  laugh   strange bird exactly  ya it was funny  god snore   laugh yup yup yup   so what now  so oh so the long and short of this office thing is that uhm uhm i'm think i'm staying in this office and i'm going to be sharing it with heidi   oh  uh she teaches monday and wednesdays and i teach tuesdays thursdays and fridays  because with with sam we'd be  clashing words   ya no no you'd be bumping into each other  no i didn't ask him about louis' schedule  cos that was the other offer louis' office  but uhm i i don i don't  really have a problem sharing it  where is louis' office  right on that  it's where jane used to be  oh yes that's right   ya   over on the first part by the door  ya   ya  ya  ya so  do you know heidi at all  not really  no i i don't even know that i've spoken to her  the only time i've ever saw her uh was in faculty meetings   two years ago when i was full-time two years ago  mhhm   oh right  cos she wasn't here this year and last year i was part-time so i didn't have to go to those  right  laugh oh that's right  well you've done okay eh in terms of sort of keeping your  presence  ya   ya ya   that's good  that's very good   ya i think of it as a chapter in my life  ya  ya  i don't know where i really don't know where   i want to go with any of this  i'm very i really gotta  have got to confront it this summer  oh really  like h like make a move of some kind  mh hmm  huh   ya ya make a move in one direction or another  you know   > mhh   uh i know i have to make an income  that's the problem but uh  you know if i if i want to keep making films i'll have to i have to be in a different environment  so  and uh you know dumb question maybe you want to keep making films  well that's a question i have to ask myself  i i can i can't answer that because  until i finish this film i feel i can't i i can only think   i can't think beyond this next film which has to be made so  ya   it has to be made  ya  ya it has to be made   for your sanity  for my sanity plus i mean i i've  received money to do it and   oh that's right  it's been an ongoing thing  right right right  so it does have to come to some kind of conclusion and then you're   oh ya absolutely and and   then i think i'll be in a in a better position to know how i feel about uh my own sort of practice  ya  ya   but you know along with that i have so many other things that i want to begin to uh begin to really sink my teeth into  oh ya  ya  like what  well i wan want   i wanna want to go back to school  i want to study  uhm there i mean there are so many areas that i wanna want to uhm really examine thouroughly and not just from  you know i d whenever you work  on a project you do your own research  ya  and as a result of that i've researched a number of things but uhm i'd like be in a situation where i'm being guided through that process a bit more  right  i love the idea of reading lists  i love the idea of of someone  having to stand up there and somehow make this generate  this this in inquiry  yup that makes sense   mhhm  so uhm i i know i really need to get back to that but i'm just with everything else i just don't know how yet   right  and if uhm if we move at the end of next year then  uhm i don't know where that would be either  so it's all very you know all over the place  oh okay   oh there is that possibility  a good possibility ya   leaving montreal you mean  ya after next year because i'll be finished here  i mean my full-time thing  and uh craig will be finished his coursework  for his uh p h d which means he could go  anywhere else really to to work on his  thesis   oh   yup   yup   right   wow hmm   so we're you know we're  thinking nationally laugh   that's a possibility   sure  ya   so we'll see but uh i have to be clear i think about where i'm heading while i'm teaching full-time  right   i have to have i have to have  a plan in the works  right  so if it means applying to places or you know even just  to teach  ya to teach or i mean even to go somewhere to do ah you know some sort of ah artist in residency  or or   or kind of a a residency thing   or extended grant thing in the states or somewhere  mhhm   i feel like i have to take on a whole new challenge  i'm not uhm i'm not feeling challenged and i don't know how to challenge myself right now because my plate is so full  right   oh no i know   that it's the stuff that  that's sitting in on my plate  that doesn't you know that should be challenging me that isn't at this point in time because it's familiar  ya   yes  and i react to uh new situations more  you know i could sort of really feel inspired   well i've just been thinking a lot recently about just h like where does a sense of rejuvenation come from in what you're doing  you know  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   especially if something that you've been doing for a while  you know  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   because i mean if you talk about this project but then you add on the first project the other film well then  you're you'll be sort of w w   working in a  certain pool for a few years  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so then where do you  ya where do you take it at a certain point  i think that happens and you can really relate to that  ya   oh ya  i think it happens with everybody who works this way   maybe at different times in different ways but  yup   but that's a good question actually  to just even think of it as like you know like the idea of a residence or something  something that is not i mean it's not all-consuming  it's contained it's but   there's new imput of some  kind   uh huh   ya   ya ya  so i really have to try to ge get  some clarity if it's possible  i don't know if it is possible at this point but  i'm gonna going to see when i'm away if i'm   kinda kind of able to think about that stuff  mhh   yup  cos i i i'm feeling very  well you know i'm feeling like oh god one more  sort of one more job on this list and they just keep word i can't seem  t to i can't make them go away  deep breath   ya   and i desparately want that feeling that everything's done  for a while just so i can uhm rejuvenate  ya   so the the film that you're doing   now and the idea to go away this summer you want to finish it this summer  mhh hmm   well i wanna want to i  wanna want to finish uhm what this film is about how to proceed with finishing off the images so that uhm i can shoot it knowing that in my mind or on paper or whatever it's it's complete and i like it  word   mhhm   and then i can proceed with the shooting  now that that's a whole other thing  i was gonna going to say  words   that's about eight months full-time   oh my god   so i can't teach when i'm doing that anyway  i have to i have to just  do that  oh my god wow that's quite a   so i mean the u i unemployment insurance is  gonna going to work out very well for that  when you finish after next year  oh this is quite re it is a long term picture   ya it's very  this is the problem   you know it's ya like aw god  but that's the only way it can be done   hmm  i mean the my my   other option was to not take this next year  ya  what and why didn't you why did you laugh   and to struggle with with  uh   fear of you know not being able to generate an in   an income here in this city in this province in either way  uh that's real   that's real enough  so plus knowing that franz is   gonna going to be in school so one of us had to sort of keep things a little more  goin going   ya  ya   ya   so without with those two things  i mean i could have made the other decision  uh huh  i could have  it wasn't out of the question but   ya but i mean   becau because   but i took it thinking okay well this is it  this is this is a chapter  i'll take i'll do i'll do   this thing one more time then i will have taught here for four years and given it what i felt i could  mhhm   mhhm  uhm but i   you will have learned a lot too   ya oh ya ya  i mean you will have learned more in four years than you would have in two  that's true   you know what i mean like  mhhm   mhhm  because  ya ya  sort of the long haul  it seemed it seemed uhm  good to sort of go over these things again each year and develop stuff  absolutely   but you know and i was real curious about that  i really wanted to to  try that out  ya i could see that  so uhm ya  anyway  well i could see that  i mean you know and i mean  the the project is never not there   mhhm  unfortunately laugh   well no ya really   the days it's hanging around your neck laugh   but i mean like i don't know i mean   some sometimes for myself the issue just becomes i'm just worried that when i do have the time that  it's not gonna going to happen or it's not gonna going to   ya   but i mean it will so you know i mean  ya   i mean maybe that is a sort of an interesting year to i don't know lay some groundwork for something after at the same time you're   ya   ha laugh that's quite something really  ya ya i don't know but i d   i don't know   no were you at i i   don't know i think you i think uh you  will have learned a lot laugh   mhhm  you know  mhhm  even if i mean i don't know how you see yourself in terms of whether you're a good teacher or whatever or what but i mean even if you just see yourself as having been valuable really  valuable to certain people  laugh   mhhm   mhhm ya 
Canada	" you know   ya but no i i you know   that's that's important and and  and uh i mean that's part of the reason people teach i think  mhh  uhm but i i quess it's a sh it's a short term project for me   for now anyway unless i come back at it again later on down the road  with with other things in mind  mhhm   ya   with new stuff  mhh  that's how i'm feeling  but in a way i don't know i just uh i just  see sort of how you are and stuff i think we   whe regardless of how you act tape cuts out   okay so what were you telling me about the women   women in work  ya well it's a   oh and then they get the keynote speaker  and that was that and that was it   it was a it's a really good idea every year we run this uh symposium  i shouldn't say every year  ya   we've been doing this for two years so this is the second year we've run a symposium  the idea is to uhm give uh our female m b a students some role models uh people who women who have m b a degrees or women who are in business or both and ah who have made it out there  mhh hmm   and so in the morning we had we had these six speakers who are m b a graduates all women  and they're obviously successful  they came in and they gave fifteen minute presentations on  what it's like uh out there for for  women   did you hear them  ya i heard some of them  some of i i   had to duck in   well was it interesting   what kind of things did they say  oh it was wonderful  i mean suzanne rayne talked about she   ha ha having to have her husband co-sign a a bank loan to start her business and now she signs her husband's  paychecks and all that kind of thing   uh huh   right ya ya   it was really it was extremely  interesting  it was very very good for our students  cos they're worried about going out there in the real world and  all of that   uh huh   ya   but they've got education for real world  they've got real education for the real world   they've got real education for the real world but  they're still afraid  but there must be several real worlds  cos the cos the laugh one that we're in here doesn't have too many job opportunities right now  so   at least laugh   no no  so they got these uh good role models and then in the afternoon we had uh six people  four women and two men who are on a panel and they talked about  well actually what we did we took quotations from ah a book called members of the club question mark  and then it was about women who are mostly about women who are who are well just commenting on business  and it was extremely neat because the issues are very controversial  i mean how do women make it in business these days  do they do they act like men  mhh hmm   and and what are the problems  and and we you always refer to the glass ceiling and this book proposes another idea  ya   that it has more to do with the comfort zone as they call it  that there are that men have a tendency to feel uncomfortable around women in business ehm that's difficult for them to work with  n not that they want to deny them opportunities although that might be the case in some instances it's more that they're just not comfortable  mhh hmm   ya  and because they're not comfortable women don't have an opportunity to negotiate and assert themselves because they  don't get invited out to that lunch for  example   mhh hmm   ya ya  the men will go out for lunch  they'll exclude the women and at lunch a lot of stuff happens  ya  so they don't have those opportunities for informal  networking in in their own companies which often ends up being very important  ya  so the women have this difficulty  they debated issues of family and how women deal with all of that stuff  you know the career track versus the family track and  whe whether you delay having your family or you have it now and deal with it and get it over with and you know all that kind of thing  mhh hmm  i shouldn't say get it over with but you know   uhm and then in the evening we had our keynote person who was  michelle sherette   mhh hmm  she's the president and c e o of signal films  and she was terrific   she was really really wonderful  she didn't give the members of the audience a lot of platitudes  it was very hard-nosed  really good advice  and uh and everybody loved it  we we had you know wine and cheese after  mhh hmm  it was great networking  and and i i  was very impressed with all these uhh people  w i was impressed with how hard they work   i mean these women work hard long long hours   and uhm that seem to be a given these days  you < } > wanna want to   ya if you wanna want to  get anywhere you gotta have got to   work like a fiend  ya   i know  not that you wouldn't know anything about that  my experience of you jen is that you work pretty uh   ya   ya but well i'm just trying to uh   to get my get the backlog cleared up  i i i'm so sick of the mess  ya  you know it was like three years like running grabbing shoving grabbing you know papers and not putting them back where they belong and you know backing-up files  ya   i i haven't  there's a lot of   you need a secretary  i word secretary couldn't figure it out  you need a full-time   but anyways you you  know what i mean though  ya   ya  so i was just running like such a a a  lunatic for so long  so i actually started again in my office today and i wanna  want to go through it  mhh hmm  and i found all of the research articles i have to return to someone  ya  exhale   do you wh do you keep  stuff on your computer  i mean do you do you have your own filing system on your  word office word    i have i have all my  you know all my sounds of english and all my  stuff like that  ya   a lot of the the the handout or  the the worksheets i've done for my students that  everything's in there  how do you keep track of articles   i mean after a while   but you can't keep articles in there  no you can't but how do you yourself when you're  your own   okay this is a very good question laugh  because i've been trying to figure out what i'm doing   because we keep we  we collect hundreds of articles  really   i mean   oh you mean like ah magazine articles or journal articles   academic articles okay so  things you photocopy  anyways   ya journal articles   well i was i'm just  about to start dealing with that  now i know what i did when i researched the last thing was i started punching holes in everything and putting them in binders  mhh hmm  but then it's a question of how to divvy it up but i think that i'm gonna going to look for what seems to be a natural category for it  mhh hmm  but i'm not sure  like all the stuff i have on from  statscan statistics canada on the immigrant literacy that type  of thing that'll be a separate section  mhh hmm   there's no point mixing that with with   uhm learning disability research  no no  is that whatcha what you mean  ya  and i'm not sure  and then i suppose it has to be somewhat chronological   so you don't you don't have   a a list somewhere on your computer  where you just have  au authors you know   no   oh that's an idea too eh  ya   where you just say so and so nineteen eighty-nine   and maybe the title and something like that  and then see if i have it   i'm always trying to figure out ways  maybe it's because i'm a capricorn   i'll ask max   i'm always trying to figure out ways of  organizing material   max has phenomemal  has phenomenal systems  everytime i  oh he's just beginning to make me sick  ya   i know how i drove people crazy when i was semi-organized   inhale cos i'm real  mhh hmm   you know he has a system where he types in z z z or q q q   when he's working  mhh hmm   one means he doesn't like something he wants to change it and another is where he hasn't finished  i don't understand  he does a word search on q q q he finds out all the places he wants to improve upon  ya   ohh  okay  he wants to find out where he finished z z z  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   cool stuff   wow word   the guy's sharp  i sorta sort of feel like i should really you know i should really take advantage of learning what i can because he's really developed great systems  mhh hmm  you know there's time you can save if you're organized   is phenomenal   exactly exactly  and that's where i'm i'm feeling   like i'm i'm like i've got this huge bag on my back and i've got to take it off and poke through it all the time  it's crazy   mhh hmm mhh hmm   it's not me  it's not the way that uh that   i normally word i normally function  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  it's so unnatural for me to be in this state  i was really a wreck  i'm beginning to get normal  i'm not going to sleep at four o'clock everyday anymore but uhm  it's been hard  mhh hmm mhh hmm  i brought you this  if you know anybody that wants to look at it they're coming to my house because my old the old owner uhm subscribed  i've sent max with this stack of them   the old owner of your house  ya  i sent max with a stack  i mean imagine eh three years later  i've sent a stack of them with max to uh loyola but  uh i don't know what  mhh hmm   well   also this has your name on it   it certainly does  but what ah   laugh   is this for me  i i ah it was yours  i think i borrowed it  i don't even remem remember   i didn't even look  i just grabbed it   is this for when we took the course   what is it  new test from e t s educational testing service  uses realistic tasks from everyday life to assess the literacy skills of adults reading   oh ya  oh ya i remember this  canadian business task force on literacy  reading   alright alright   and what you mean i don't ha   have i didn't even check this out i don't think  what happened  you mean i photocopied this article and you didn't read it  i can't believe i didn't   cos this is this related to my course that i did this fall   hmm   oh can i borrow it again  well it's in the stack of six hundred articles that you still have to read  we all have six hundred articles don't we   six hundred articles   no i don't have that many  i've almost i'm almost through  the stack  ya   like this one is cool  remember how i was saying what was different about uh what i was doing  this one ah we don't want to sit here while you read it of   course but you can see by the amount of pink this is loaded with stuff relevant to the work i was doing with the the work  that i'm doing   with the sounds of english  mhh   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  not only that this is where they talk about alphabetic coding as opposed to phonics which is what i do  ya  ahhh  hmm   this is this is a neat stuff  speaker said "" a""   this is very neat stuff  ya it is and it doesn't talk about the shapes of the words laugh   laugh no funny  ya ya ya "
Canada	" god i not that anyone would ever come up with such an idea  no no nobody would and they certainly would never get it to a publisher  and actually get published in a series of three books  laugh   no i mean   they would certainly ne  never if they came up with it> they'd  ne never  they'd never write about it  glossy covers  ya  i'd you know how'd they get it there  anyways i show you to th i should show this to you later   hmm   can i borrow this again  i feel really bad  wow i don't know if i can read this the print is really small  it's really really poor print but it's good  ya   ya  it's really good stuff  good stuff ya   i mean in a few pages you get a very very complete picture of the uh    of what's happening   uh huh   ya   so you you want to borrow that one again   can i borrow it again  well i why well when we're finished  uh in here we i i  can photocopy it right on the machine out  there   okay   okay   this is eighty-eight  ya   i mean i've got i've got uh  there's a new statscan statistics canada coming out   in uh huh in this fall this fall with new research  and not only that but it's been coordinated with i think thirteen countries are doing it ah with comparable testing tools  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  do you know what the rate of illiteracy is in canada  ya i do but it's at home  i don't i don't have the stats in my head right now  no   and ya see there's two definitions of illiteracy  i i'm sure there must be at  least two definitions  there's illiterate functionally illiterate   are there only three or four   three or four levels   i i can check it out   illiterate functionally illiv   illiterate   and literate  and visiting professor  oh no there's illiterate literate functionally illiterate and then there's visiting professor  mhh hmm   laugh   laugh   i think some of them have really   well maybe they're not illiterate but they're non-standard english  visiting professors  laugh   laugh   who laugh   laugh ya   what about our non-standard engli  english   what do you mean ee ah uh they're they're   not mother tongue speakers of english   ya we have several professors ya yup ya   non-mother tongue speakers ya   i see what the joke is now yes   ya   there's some professors too for that matter   ya ya ya   like that ryan babcock guy  oh man   whoa laugh he is tough to understand  laugh   laugh well ya he's a  he's always speaking with one accent or another  ya ya  ya cough   this is a this is another   really major article   you know like they're saying dyslexia is like is  is basically a crock and  hmm   it's it's really wild  this is like so exciting for me to read  hmm   this is better than anything i got in the education   journals   mhh   mhh hmm   much better  i it's lightyears away  from it   mhh hmm mhh hmm   this like just nails it  and of course it's it's it's stuff that's come out rather recently  this one is oh this one's eighty-six  this is old you know   mhh hmm   you know i can't believe i didn't have these  i didn't i didn't know and you know  when did we do that course together   nineteen ninety-one   it was around ninteen ninety-one or two eh  cough   ya and we didn't have those articles  no we didn't have these at all   ya useless   and so i'm trying to figure out now how to put them  and you know this is mostl  mostly well this is journal of educational psychology   this is uhm reading research quarterly  i think i had a few articles from reading research quarterly  mhh hmm  but   do you know the people who wrote them  like are they big names   i do know some of the names like stanovich and there's another person uhm that i had heard of uh schticht   and in fact some of the stuff i've research not researched  was quoted  ya  ya in other articles  hmm  but the people i'm really excited about are the uh the   leibermann leibermann and leibermann  people  mhh hmm   wow look at this   see the importance of using meaning-based strategies in addition to code-based strategies for reading instruction is fully acknowledged by code-oriented advocates but not uhm  not whole-language reading   mhh hmm   and now they're sort of saying it  oh we never excluded uh explicit phonetics  well gee look and goodwin your founder  mhh hmm  you know he he just  completely said  there's no way   ya   there's something very appealing about   wh whole just calling   something whole language you know  but you see i say the the the way that i teach explicit phonetics is whole language because it uses all four  language skills listening speaking reading and writing  mhh hmm mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm  sure  and and that's  the thing with uh the whole language is you don't just isolate it where you're passively reading all the time but you discuss what you're  reading and you   mhh hmm   that type of uh  ya  i mean really whole language is i think what any good teacher does once the kids can read  and you know getting them  mhh hmm   and even at the earliest levels of reading that's what they do  you know like when you're reading dr seuss  with with your child you say like huh look at that what's that animal oh isn't he funny  looking oh   mhh hmm   ya ya   you know  you're engaging them in the process  it's not just  that reminds me of something because there's a  cough one of the women in the faculty here she  came across a dr seuss book for people in management  what laugh   ya believe it or not   and and the i don  don't my information is very sketchy   but it maybe it's a dr seuss type of book or a do somebody's adapted a dr seuss book  but apparently it's brilliant  really  ya ya  and so i wanna want to i just  you just remin reminded     well he did he did  pretty good with that page about dad eh  dad is sad very very sad   ya  dad had a bad day  what a day dad had   laugh   laugh and everybody loves it  you know what i mean  ya ya   you don't have to be a five year-old  no  ya  that reminds me have you have are you seeing any  of the current disney movies  no  have you   like poc  pocahontas or lion king  or anything like that  no   no >  aladdin uh uh  sleeping beauty no  you haven't seen aladdin  no  ohh rent it  robin williams is a scream  it is such  he's pretty good in the frog prince too  oh he's very good  i mean he was very good in mrs doubtfire  ya   uhh   i haven't seen that either  oh you gotta have got to  see it   laugh   that's an incredibly good movie  ya but   it's funny without being silly  that's ya that's   ah i mean i love funny movies but i don't like silly movies  ya  i mean silly movies just bore me to death  but i thought aladdin was amazing  wake up and smell the hummus   you gotta have got to  when he says that i just i just fall off my chair  it's uh this is extremely funny  laugh   and uh mrs doubtfire is really really good too  you know the idea of mrs doubtfire  ya   he's a nanny  ya to get close to his kids or  cos he wants to be close to his kids   and at one point he's in he uh he's  upstairs in in this house in his   in his house although his his  wife doesn't know who who he really is or who he-she really is  and uhm he's having a leak alright and the bathroom door's open  and he's dressed as a woman and he  and he looks compl  completely very convincing you  know and he's he's in the bathroom standing up at the toilet and he's hoisting up his dress so he can pee you know like a man and laugh one of the children walks by and sees this  woman laugh with these hairy legs  dress all hoisted up and peeing into the toilet  ya   ya   ya   laugh   i mean it's just what it does to your mind  is is extremely cute and funny  because it's you know you're so shocked  because it's so out of context  ah   ya ya ya   you really don't see you know women don't do it like that you know   well not the ones that i know laugh   anyways very very funny  laugh   more research laugh   ya ya   and i went to see lion king like cos i i   like kids' movies  they often are quite fun  mhh hmm  and uhm i didn't like it  i thought it was trying too hard  ya   and it was it was  actually it was kinda kind of sexist in some ways  i thought it was a little  ya   did you see pocahontas  i saw pocahontas  it's supposed to really not be very good compared to the others   uhm i liked it more than the lion king  oh that's interesting   at least they made an effort to show the white man as being not all > his  history the history </} books cooked him up to be  you know   ya ya   and uh but still i i prefer the old movies cos i find the kids' movies now no matter what are political  they're all political  and they're a they're all trying to satisfy everybody's everybody's ev  every you kn know  every lobbyist out there  they're trying to say okay we've taken care of that we've taken care of this  and i just uh i don't like these modern movies  they're they're not there isn't  enough fantasy in them  ya  uh people complained about a lot of movies as being sexist and this and that but you know pinocchio snow white and the seven dwarf not "" dwarfs"" jungle book  i mean kids don't think of them as being sexist or whatever you know   no no   i i remember when i was   i was talking with somebody about fairy tales  and you know i don't show this to my children  they're so sexist   and i said you know i read fairy tales all my life  i just identified with the guy that was riding off on the charger  mhh  i could identify with both depending on  you know it wasn't a problem for me   ya what's what's   ya we can't look at it through adults' eyes you know  when a kid is five or six years old or eight years old or ten years old i they're not  they're not they don't look  it's just not that way   i mean and i don't think they're words  x   i mean they say that that   the the little girls were conditioned then to be passive and comb their hair and wait for their prince you know  well huh maybe if it's reinforced  ya   mhh hmm  but i i never i never saw a problem like that  me neither  i mean it's i shouldn't e  even say anything because it's men  are usually the ones who are   i think it's i mean i think it's great what's happening in today's literature  and you know like the paperbag princess and  everything   ya   ya   but to to sort of put down that whole fairy tale thing  oh i was at a rummage sale and i saw a red fairy book and i was really tempted to buy it but i just said jenny you've got enought junk to take care of  ya   ya you have a very significant library if i remember correctly  cough   and i i've been unloading you know  i'm gonna going to have to unload more  ya  i have way too much too much stuff  ya you need a librarian and an executive secretary  a secretary and   and a wife  cos you don't even know how   you need a wife  ya ya we all could use one of those  whoops i'm not allowed to say that  i can't say that   laugh   i can say it  ya   we can all use one of those  ya  laugh   i need laugh   i need what  actually i need another one of me "
Canada	 and cos i can cook   ya ya that would be great if i  had two of me  ya   ya  one to just take care of stuff and the other to go out there and bring home the bread and butter right   ya ya   no i'm finding i'm finding it's very hard  of course i'm talking about co  co-habiting we've been talking about co-habiting   for by next year  mhh hmm mhh hmm  god just the thought of going through with scraping through another winter with the bills and the this and the that  and i just like huuuuh  ya   ya   and the the just the responsibility  i mean i look at how much more paperwork i do  because you own a house  i think so  it's just it's all more  ya  it's all more  like calling norco and then you know  ya sure  i don't know it's all stupid  ya  ya i remember  i owned a house   i really i really  don't like it  no  i don't  it can turn you also i read this wonderful article about how owning a house can turn you into a very dull person   because it can take a normally intelligent person who used to read books and turn them into someone who falls in love with  going to the nursery to buy big slabby bags of sheep manure to  bring it home to put on your garden  ya   ya   ya so you think that's what happened to me already  i haven't detected yet but you you could  you you you could you could crack you know  i have two bags of sheep manure out back   laugh i've been cracking for a long time   you you could start you could start   you could start to really get into fertilizers and manure instead of ideas you know   well ya   cos it takes over your life  ya  i think that's what i'm beginning to find  i it's really a big job and i'm really tired of it  mhh  you know if i if i had uhm somebody sharing the place i mean there'd be enough money to pay somebody top sorta sort of like okay you do that  mhh hmm   pay for a service   like you dig up the this and  then i'll plant what i want  and take care of it for the summer  ya ya   cough   mhh   or you know   it wouldn't take much  and i i think it might be worth it if you can do that because it is really nice to have a backyard and you know to to be in a neighbourhood where people aren't you know all on top of  each other   uh huh   ya ya sure  but i am tired of the work  mhh hmm   i really am tired of the physical work and watering things  i'm just up to here with it  and yet you can get a sprinkler system for a vegetable garden  why not   mhh hmm  you know you can actually get to a point if you have the money where it's not taking up your entire life  mhh hmm mhh hmm  but i think it's taking up too much of mine  i'm really i'm really sure of it  is it is it things like the garden and repairs or both or  both  ya  like i burnt myself out last fall getting my garden in cooking and uh staining the back porch and i was back at work and i you know  mhh hmm   ya  i i don't know how i went through last year   no  a man's home is his castle  a woman's home is her hassle   very good ryan   what do you think  i think it's sexist  laugh   laugh ya ya  but  well it's because men will tend to let a lot of things go  ya  right  ya  it's not that i mean the   they will fix them eventually   ya  i think it's a matter of timing  ya   it's not that they're slobs  ya  although some of them are  it's just that eventually they'll  but eventually is is longer than it is for women  women will do it more they'll  deal with it more quickly it seems  gross generalization number forty-seven feigned voice   laugh   laugh who is that  it's only supposed to be two people   ya ya is there someone else in this room laugh    laugh   ya there's a lot to do   ya no i'm really i'm really  beginning to look at it because i i just don't have time to do what i have to do  mhh hmm  and like i say he's been really pushing me to uhm  to get sounds of english in to a publisher  if i do that next year i i can't  i can't have all these other things on  my shoulders   mhh hmm   mhh hmm no no  and i don't know what the solution is  i really do not know   your house is in good shape though over all isn't it  ya   and you don't have structural problems  you don't need to replace the windows  the roof is okay  no   ya  cough the basement doesn't leak   it's got a new furnace and a decent  water heater you know   mhh hmm   ya   ya it's all it's all  fine  mhh   uhm it just it's too much   for me with the workload i have  ya ya  you know full time job plus studying plus sometimes having a life  i think this is how the government keeps people under control  ahh  by encouraging them all to buy houses  ya  you see if you're if you buy a house you're so busy maintaining it you don't have time to  be politi politically   to be politically  active   then you're busy   to make trouble   ya   right you can just you're just absorbed   by all of the responsibility  i'm really getting pulled because you know we've talked about like buying something else or whatever whatever  i mean and it's all so hypothetical now anyways  hmm   you know we're still limping through the first few months  laugh you know  ya ya  whap huh oh it's okay  alright  and then we go through another round and then whap and  laugh then you know   mhh hmm mhh hmm ya   but uh  well the material world is  really it's a big number dealing with stuff  ya  you know you can really get get   your knickers in a twist you know sort of dealing with  the material world   ya   and i mean for two reasons   one is that you know were he to move in it would be more or less predominantly my house because it's been set up by me  mhh hmm  but uhm   so it'd be a symbolic thing actually  if you moved out then you ya ya   also if we moved in to our own place but you know that's a that's a big deal to do also   when you're still like when you're just in your  second year kind of of  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  you know to decide to  ya  so you know what at the same time i sort of see spending two to three years there and seeing how things go and uhm   mhh hmm mhh hmm   so maybe maybe he could build a little cabin in the corner of the garden   that would be totally his  ya  and then and then he could be the groundskeeper  i don't think he'd go for that  i thought you were gonna going to   to say he could he could set up his office there  in the corner   then you could then you could   write a book   you could write a book together and call it lady chatterley's lover or something like that   he's working on a book on statistics  statistics whistle   ya latent variable path in structural equation modelling  hmm  he's in psychology  ya  so wh wh why does he want  this is a new kind of statistical analysis ah approach or  it's a well what he's been doing and what he's doing ah ah like at the a p a american psychological association is he's giving workshops on sort of like advanced statistical procedures and approaches for uh researchers and uhm article reviewers  cough   mhh hmm mhh hmm  so they know what's going on  and and actually the publisher  asked him to write this book  mhh hmm   ya  hmm   uhm because well like because  he's been giving these workshops and i gather quite successfully  where does he go to give these workshops  a p a convention  oh okay   hmm  that's all over the world then  i mean you it's an international conference  uhh it's the american psychology association conference   ya ya   i i i suppose there could be people from all over the place ya  hmm  but i would s guess  <[primarily word   i didn't know that a p a had conferences  that's   i wonder what they talk about  well they have all kinds of workshops i can   sh show sh  show   the a p a manual  laugh they've got a they've got a  program guide this big  i forget how many people he told me on average are there  but it is like i think somewhere between ten to fifteen thousand maybe a little more ya people that attend this  ya   what  ya  ten to fifteen thousand people attend an a p a conference   i think so i think so   cough   we can call him and check laugh   what do they argue over how how to  wh wh how to do citations   no there's all people presenting papers uhm   doing giving workshops  and apparently the psychologists actually get credits because they've got to be constantly upgrading their skills or keeping  up with the newest things  uh huh   and uh what else do they do  uhm there's a there's a there's a  you know a psychology aid ah kind  of i don't know what show  is it like a   mhh hmm   what is it like the learned society or something  do th is there people there from different disciplines or is it only psychology  psychology i think  just psychology  ya   hmm   well   and they have things on on  drinking on teenagers on this this on everything  ya   huh   and then they got all kinds of products for psychologists like relaxation tapes you know   no kidding  ya they got a big showroom too  laugh that's really neat   well i'll tell you all about it because he's  taking me laugh   it's funny eh   ya where's the next conference  ya   well it's in new york  ya  august tenth to fifteenth we're going  wow  exciting   wow that's fun  well it's going to be nice to to  do something this summer  well ya i mean you you'll go to new york and you you don't have to work   you i mean for you it's  it's work   ya but i'm gonna going to   take his workshop  ya  cos i wanna want to   i wanna want to   i figure this is a really ga great   chance for me laugh to keep on top of my   what i studied in research  and i'm i'm really going uh  ya   ya sure   so can i ask you where you are in all of this   in your studies and  no i don't wanna want to  talk about it   you don't want to talk about it  huh i'm still i'm still trying to  figure out  well what i did today was i'm trying to get the money i put towards my thesis option in ed educational  tech technology freed towards my credits in adult   ed education   because there's three hundred and fifty dollars just sitting there  wow   mhh hmm  and they're telling me that unless i go back and do that  degree it doesn't count anymore  and i'm like i'm sorry there's something wrong here  mhh hmm  so i've gotta got to speak to  pam cook tomorrow  apparently if i can get a student request and it goes through the graduate whatever then maybe it can happen  mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm  so there's one thing i'm doing  ya th this   ya student request is a way to go   and then somebody and somebody and somebody ah is looking into the possibility of transferring more ed   educational tech technology credits into the dip diploma program 
Canada	 the dip diploma   the dip diploma   ad adult dip  diploma   ad adult ad adult  ed education dip  diploma   ya  oh okay  so that it's through but you see i then want to take that degree as you know and not turn it into a diploma but be able to contribute that towards my pre-thesis   credits in a master's  cough   mhh   okay so you you want to if i understand correctly you want to take the the the  diploma and take all those credits  and and throw  them into the   ya   ya   ya along with the stats course and the research and design course  and you wanna want to throw them  i in phone rings   what  okay i guess you can answer it  excuse me though   i guess i can answer it ya  it could be home   just one moment  isn't it after hours   hello  yes  uhm actually i am  where are you  uh huh  it did  no we can we can split one  uhm i don't know where to get another cartridge though  uh uh trying to think  okay i'll just make a note of that  i'll have to get one tomorrow  uh alright i'm glad you called and called me  i'll get a i'll get a cartridge tomorrow  no problem  so they'll be another one there tomorrow night  mhh hmm  mhh hmm  ya  right  so you're going to leave it there  okay  alright so  no  alright uhm so maybe i'll speak to you later  i'm sorta sort of in the me  middle of something now  okay  talk to you later  bye one-sided telephone conversation   sorry about that  that's okay  ya so ya that's what i wanna  want to do  cough   oh well hmm i wonder how that's gonna going to  work becuase they the i know that there's sorta sort of a rule about double counting credits  no it's not it wouldn't be double counting  i don't want the diploma  oh you don't want the diploma   i just wanna want to  complete the credits that will allow me to get certification   ohh right  and there is a precedent from university of montreal  somebody who completed the requirments for the   dip diploma for teacher certification  within a master's degree  mhh hmm   it should be possible  i know it's just that you know first of all  gina 's not being helpful because she doesn't want me to go and graduate from another department  ya   she wants me to graduate from ad  adult dip diploma </}  mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm  and uh and a lot of people just don't understand it  it's just they you know   it's just it's all too complicated for them  mhh   i've got the number of the ombudsman and i'm thinking maybe if i speak to the ombudsman and try to get them to see  i mean i why should i have to do  another stack of credits to get around to doing my thesis  mhh hmm   i mean how many courses can i take  mhh hmm  they're not nuh virtually none  of them are helping me with what i'm with what my  field is except because i make them  mhh hmm mhh hmm  you know  mhh hmm ya well  and some of them i can't  well why don't you could call the ombudsperson you know   you think it's worth it  well marianne is very good  ya   marianne nelson you know her  mhh hmm   i would speak to her  okay  she's terrific  okay   she's very bright  ya i just need somebody who can   who knows their way around the  university   she   this is   i'm just i just feel like i'm i'm going in a circle and  every you know one person says yes the next person says no but i don't know how they all connect and how we can connect it up and and get you know get this cleared up  mhh hmm   she can she's brilliant at  this  ya   i mean i mean i don   don't   i mean there's no guarantee that she can  help but but if anybody knows   how the university functions  she knows better than anybody  marianne eh   i'm looking for my agenda   well no but   ya   okay   okay that's what i need  and somebody neutral you know where it they're not it they where they're you know they've got nothing at stake     oh ya that's that's  the beauty of of of the  ombuds office cos   because that person has no vested interest    in   ya   that's what i was thinking   oh that's good to know   exactly   marianne who  nelson   how do you spell it  n e l s o n  right   eight five eight two six five one   two six five one   two five two   five one is the secretary  okay  five two is marianne 's number  okay  ya  and she's terrific  well i worked in that office for three years you know  okay   really  well that   i was a part - time ombudsman  eww  ya and that's when i got to know her   does this seem like a reasonable thing to approach them with  sure  i mean you're in a i think  in a in a sense you're asking for another student request  ya in the end   you're asking   ya you you know in the final analysis you wanna want to present a case  ya i figure i've got almost the  i i probably have like with the thirty credits some of them won't count towards a master's degree  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   so they'll be just dead weight  mhh hmm  right  so they won't count so i'll lose i'll lose   maybe uh six easily six because it's practicum  mhh hmm mhh hmm ya  and then maybe a couple of other courses that won't count  mhh hmm   but then there's the research  so there's a few more courses and then i can do my   my thesis  because it's forty-five credits for a   a master's in education  mhh hmm   four f forty- f five   in in in ed education  studies  no in education not in  oh in education yes ed education  studies ya not ed educational tech  technology though   ya ya the ed education   studies is forty-five  ya  and there's three  there's ed education studies child study and ed educational  tech technology   mhh hmm   ya  i don don't   i don't know what child study is  ya but i can't i can't work into child study  no   i think that's unfeasible   at with my  background   ya   ya ya  you know you can't do do your diploma in adult ed education and then say well i want to do my master's in child studies can i use these laugh   i mean there's a lot of overlap in my field actually which is funny  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  but i don't think i can pull that off   no   i'll do my doctorate in child studies  conceptually it might be a bit confusing for someone  ya   but   hmm so you want to gradu  graduate you want to do to finish in ed educational tech  technology right  is that it  no i don't care about ed educational   tech technology at this point  i just want to get this i  wanna want to get to my thesis   no   ya  and y you know uhm   you're you're thinking that some of the courses i took there might not be acceptable in the   and that's also possible too  there might be more than i expect  well there ya there are you've taken   ed educational tech  technology courses that  well i don't know how many you've done altogether but some of them would for sure not be acceptable by ed education   studies  uh the one the one that i think would not be but it could be like a special topic would be interactive multimedia  ya hmm  but if that gets gone you know it it d   it doesn't really matter  it's just it's still gonna  going to be at least twenty credits that i can probably put towards forty-five in a master's thesis  mhh hmm   i don't wanna want to spend the rest of my life doing this  no you got you gotta have got to finish it because it it'll  it feels so good  ya   oh oh yes i was gonna going to   ask you yes  and   so when did you finish  the uhm well convocation was uh  when was it anyway  june early june  ya   early june  i don't remember the exact date  fifth or something like that   and it was amazing  just a good feeling that's really nice when the pain stops  just like  that   ya   yup   i can't i can't  do it anymore  i   i liked it  i mean i enjoyed what i did and i learned a lot   uhm but it's   i'm just having i'm  i'm having difficulty because there's been too many stumbling blocks  you know i started out and then ka-chunk and then ka-chunk and then ka-chunk and then   mhh hmm mhh   you know it's just i'm i'm  sure i'll get going again once this gets cleared  but i'd really like to try to clear this up this summer  mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm  because i need to have something in place  i i've been in this limbo for too long  mhh hmm mhh hmm   ya and and you at a at a   certain point you r you run   into trouble with your credits  you know if they're o too old   oh really eh  that's what they call stale dating   uh huh  so they'll say your credits are stale  well you know what am i supposed to do anymore  you know and that's par part  i didn't even know about that but i guess that's part of it too   you know after five years or something like that they start  getting kinda kind of antsy about your credits  they'll say well the program's changed and you can't use those credits anymore  even for your own program  ya ya  you know it becomes really   there's something to be said for suffering you know all at once  getting it over   ya i can't afford to do that option now  no no you can't   so it's a lot of things i'm not too uh y  i've got i've gotta got to   deal with them  and it's very overwhelming for me  ya   you know it's on every front  ya ya  but what can you do what can you do  hmm   how long is your mortgage  twenty years twenty-five   no i've i  gotta have got to renew it in august  ya  i've been getting the lowest possible   but i mean overall your amortization period   oh yes i think it's twenty-five years  sorry i see what you're saying now  ya   ya  ya  so you don't wanna want to til you're   ya no mortgages are twenty years  ya  ya you don't wanna want to wait for another twenty years before you go back to school   ya well   ya   ya so there's a there's a lot of factors  and uhm and it's really hard dealing with this new relationship when my factors are so heavy  mhh hmm mhh hmm   you know nothing is in place for me  i'm just trying to resolve a lot of issues now and it makes me very uh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   well it's hard when you wanna want to  accomplish things  when you're like that you know  you're sort of the opposite of a flake   you know you're you're you're you're a worker  ya  you know you justif justify  you're always justifying your existence in one way or another laugh you know  ya  i it you know in a   in a serious kind of way uhm  so you've got your master's in ed  educational tech technology now   oh ya as a matter of fact i think i have it right here  ahh well you haven't put it on your wall yet  i did i can even show it to you  look at that  wow  isn't that neat   ohh very nice  this makes me feel really good  you can teach a middle-aged dog new tricks you know  and you're looking at  ya it's a it's it's good   it's good because es especially  because it's especially gratifying because i did really well in the program and i was a hopeless student before  uh huh   you know when i was an undergraduate   cough   ya  my transcript is a total embarrasment  cough really  oh ya it's a total embarrasment  i think i have the worst transcript of anybody  i've ever word   cough   are you serious   ya well you should hear uh that joe guy out there in  psych psychology   he's like grade point average you know of a f  four three point nine five five five or whatever   ya   you know it's like oh be quiet  ya  you know i said don't you know the joy of flunking a course  you don't know how good it feels to just say this course  is full of it  ya   the heck with it  the political  flunk me see if i care laugh   i only did that in college and i could afford to lose a few credits because they've always got you filling  more than you need  ya   oh ya sure sure 
Canada	 might as well  yeah  mm  n they're good they're very good   quality  mm hmm  possibly hand-woven  mm no i don't think so   mmm   mmm signs of feet there   it's probably foot-woven  okay  here  yes   ahhh  and that is word   bowlin bowling shoe bag  no  mm uh  since i don't bowl   a dollar   mm ya  oh  uh something which uhm   uhm hmmh   hm word   i i when i w  was told yes you can go to uhm er simon fraser  university you know when simon fraser phoned back saying yes there are positions still places open so that you can go uhmmmm  because the uh the deadline was the fourteenth of april    mm hmm   mm hmm   uhm and in fact uh payment is due tomorrow  however i was told  no there's one or two words   oh dear   yeah they always make one or two words    uhm what happened was that uhm i started thinking about people i know up there  i actually know quite a few  oh really  yeah   i mean uh professional friends and uh  well you don't see the relatives if you're going to see them   well i don't know  i may see where they live uh probably two names  it'd be better not to see them there  mind you if you're there for two weeks  ya i i i'm going to go out and say  i'm not here   laugh   yeah hmm well  okay anyway let's concentrate on this  word   okay there is all this stuff huh  yeah  this is very good for cutting bread  yes it's   do you have a knife like that  uh we do have a serrated knife but th   i know this is very good for cutting bread  ah it was grandma's  yes it's a very old one  oh we have to face the uhm mics  yeah  ah so y you can have it if you want  because a y you cut   laugh a lot of bread  yes we cut a loaf of bread a day  so uhm   so why don't you take it  mm hmm  okay clears throat   now what about these mart   well no  i th w we have half a dozen  we have eight  eight  that are similar to those  do you  yeah  okay   so those can go   so how much do you think each  uh for something like that probably you could get fifty cents each  yeah that's what i was thinking too  huh whispered   okay uhm  now oh  there's there's actually two kinds  of gas plates of glass plates   now do you have any glass plates  you mean clear glass  cl clear   yeah like these  no  do do you need any or want  any  uhm   uhm i think it would be up to them to decide  you know yeah  yeah   if you don't have them i think it's because she decided not  well why don't you ask  mumbles okay end mumble 21 seconds of silence   mmmm  oh yes   well come on pick   mm well  oh that was good word   ah yeah  there's another bottle of it  mm   yes yes  would you like another bottle laugh   no only half  no   no laugh   yes exactly  okay now these plates   it struck me that it might be a good idea to save them   yeah now uh  do you have you have this set don't you  no that's it  that's it  that's that's what's left  that's that's what's left  good lord  i think that she   what happened   i think she gave some uh sent some  to the salvation army i think  no because that was the entire good set  oh no no no that wasn't the good set  that was the working set that we had early on  very that was their first set after they got married  oh  yep  mm cos i remember it being hauled out uh for uh when we had company  and maybe this is it what eight or ten or twelve  two words you know so   hmm   maybe anyway i think we should keep em  them   yeah  this uh this too should be kept  a i think cup   no it's not it's just glass  no it's just glass  oh no it's not no  it's just glass mm   and in fact it's chipped  mm  so it's no great deal  it's it's in fact i don't  think we'll even sell it  mm   we can always try  puffs breath out laugh   put a dollar on it  twenty-five cents  oh twenty-five cents  yeah mm   mm  mm hmm  this is amazing you know  this is the only example of kind of uhm rough - thrown pottery that i think maeve had  do you what that is   two or three words china   do you know what it is  no  it's not the only example clears throat ah because i've got one or two like this  they're ginger jars  ah  that's the way ginger used to come in these  so actually it's a uh it's an  interesting antique  mm hmm  well i i was thinking this   this word as well three or four words   yeah that's right   this one in particular  and uhm  and there's a big one upstairs i   a nice one as well  yeah er i kind of don't like to just ship those off  no no no no   you know i don't  no particularly something like this which says that it's  grand medal of merit ghana eighteen seventy-three   and the only prize medal for marmalade london eighteen sixty-two   probably indicates that it wasn't made yesterday   well i dunno don't know   well contents one pounds nett and  nett is spelt with two ts   uh anyway i think that we should probably keep those  no   no i think we should keep those  uh where are you putting the things   now what about this   well yeah i think it it it's   antiquey as well  it it it is   yeah it is antiquey exactly  yeah  oh okay about 22 seconds' silence   okay now these are funny little things ah dishes   mm yeah   yeah i don't recall having seen that  before  well she never really used it  no  it's it's   this is stuff we some of this stuff we went through when she left the apartment  hm  and we didn't want it so uh word   yeah it's a a nippon  crockery brand which makes it antiquey  that's right   hmm  that's right  what it's worth who knows  well  it's got a crack in it i think  well charge high  it's got a crack  yeah but nonetheless  early japanese china  yeah     hm   it's a candy dish i think  it's a candy dish that is not clean  really  up in there  put your finger in   ughhhh   oh yes  oh dear  alright   uhm okay   we'll have to uh put it aside for the time being   how much  i'd put a high price on it  well   like what  ten dollars  no pronouced 'noooooe'   yeah sure  point out that it is genuine antique  you think   i don't know what this stuff goes for at sort of at   uh antique stores  yeah well i know   do you know  i have no idea  no me neither   so if you get it uh  jude there was somebody who put this  for the equivalent of approximately seven dollars two drawings in barcelona  we wanna want to get rid of this stuff   they were both authenticated as being by picasso  mm hmm  they are each worth approximately seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars  start laugh oo go end laugh   laugh   there was probably no capital gains tax  on that one word   laugh   okay what about this huh  what is that  it's a  it's a nondescript  it looks okay if you if you like that partic   if you you either like it or don't like it laugh   ah this too is uhm   nippon  no it isn't  it's three crown china germany   uhm   it i dunno don't know  it may it may have come from madelyn   it's an antique too   well it may have  i don't like it and i never did  n it's it's a kind well it's it's uhm   it's a kind of finish that actually is quite expensive you know  is it  yeah  cos of the uhm  pearlized effect   yeah   yeah   yeah   yeah   coloured pearl effect  yeah so what should i put on that  i don't know  jan might like it actually  or has she seen it  word she's seen it yeah  the the ib the  word   no th the reason why  i i i mention that is because uh  jan's mother was buying things like this at one point when she was  uhm still buying things and uhm  this sort of stuff actually

Canada	 ya   so what's keeping you so busy these days then if you've gotten the master's done and all that  well that's a good question  one of the things i'm doing is preparing to go up north again  ya   that that's taking up a lot of time  ya  uhm there are five of us on this team  uh huh  this project has never been  it's a new project  ya  it's never been done  ya  that's the creative writing one right   ya   these teachers up in james bay they all of them have had four courses in cree literacy   and now they're ready to go to the next stage which is to which is to develop their own creative writing skills  mhh hmm  so they're now literate in cree  well on they can write cree but  they're not they're not very good at writing stories in cree  mhh hmm   and the the objective or one of the objectives of this program is to develop a written discourse uh in cree among cree teachers  mhh hmm   so that they can pass on in the recursive way these skills to their children their students  mhh hmm   and uhm it's difficult for them because cree is their cree wri write written cree is their second written language  they write in english and speak in cree   so it's unusual for them to write in cree  it's not comfortable for them   ya ya you were saying ya   it's a different > alphabet for word  ya  uhm and they   from what they from what they've been learning today about i mean what a   well i guess there aren't that many people have been learning  but i'm thinking about this problem for example that the chinese have   transferring skills to roman alphabet the iranians the  word i mean it's crazy that they didn't use roman alphabet to write their language  mhh   ya   mhh hmm mhh hmm ya   it's it's absolutely counter-productive  it's weird isn't it  it is  it's absolutely stupid   ya mhh mhh hmm ya  i mean the chinese are going to pinyin   ya ya  it's really interesting  i mean it looks beautiful  it looks much more you know aesthetically impressive but you know ah ah i don't know  i've seen words   mhh   how do you program a computer to use that stuff  well uhh stuff like that  ya ya it's strange  and just the transferability of skill you know  it must very cultural   it must be very political  i really wonder sometimes what the motive was or what the   under understanding   and sometimes it's just a lack of understanding  about what the implications of making a choice like that are  mhh hmm   ya ya  right i don't i don't know   cos it does it look a little bit like inuktitut inuit language   uhm yes  ya  same it's syllabics   ya   and and it's quite beautiful to to see   ya exactly   it's very beautiful ya  ya   but they don't know how to write in in in   cree  and the they're losing a lot of their written well they're lo losing   i gu guess sh   should well they're not losing the written  they're losing stories  ya ya and they're not   and in and it's  a problem to write down stories because in these in aboriginal cultures to write down a story is is  almost a travesty  ya  because as soon as you writ write  it down you it becomes static  ya  and there's no fluidity to it  there's no do because every generation of elders   no interaction with the audience and  ya  ya   there's the every generation of  of elders has has a   every elder has a   maybe they bring in people that are   contemporary ya   they bring in people and and  it can change according to the weather or animal migrations or a whole bunch of things  ya   but the uhh not totally change but slightly change   the legends and the myths you know   ya ya   so what we're trying to do is trying to stay away from  myth and legend because in fact they don't allow any critiquing  of of legend  oh okay   mhh hmm   legend is not to be criticized  mhh hmm  legend is to be listened to  mhh hmm  and uhm so we're gonna  going to try and teach strategies for writing stories  mhh hmm   and and they will then use these strategies for their children to write down  down stories  and we don't know what the heck we're doing  right   we're rookies at this  and as i think i mentioned to you on the phone   word   well i think anybody doing this would be rookies   well i mean we are teachers you know  we're we don't   and this hasn't been done before so we're gonna  going to have simul simultaneous    but that's what i'm saying   ya   so anybody doing it would be  rookies   ya   ya   that's right  and we're gonna going to have simultaneous translation  it's gonna going to be  wild   but i don't know how that's gonna   going to work  and it's about ten days total you said  mhh  incredible   ya   all day sessions  mhh we arrive and we go wednesday night thursday night  friday afternoon friday night all day saturday all day sunday saturday morning saturday afternoon end of tape   how was your weekend  oh it was it was fine  i i just decided  uh we were drinking beer after the thing and uh everybody's talking about where they're going for the

hottest days of the year  and it was outside  a garden party and   uh they had a piper and everything  mhh hmm  that was   it turned out well  ya it was really it was really  good  in some ways it was kinda kind of sad because she was married for a long time and uhm the the  family is really really close to her ex-husband   and they haven't been apart that long  so they weren't they weren't   quite ready for this new guy  to come into the family  ya   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  it would be hard   all her brothers and sisters came from all over the place you know  even word   all over canada or  ya most of them are from the west coast so   mhh hmm  it's great that you went  ya   ya  so i got to see the whole bunch and and   everything  ya and she was very hapy that i i made it  and you got to see all your nieces and nephews  well no it was it wasn't   my my nieces that i'm so fond of   they were at uh they have a trailer and so they were up there for the whole weekend  mhh hmm   and i

youn the younger  one  rob   so both of them have jobs now  ya  and i didn't see fred at all  he was partying all weekend  mhh hmm mhh hmm  but anyway  so how was your weekend  what did you do  ah what did i do   oh i came   you didn't have any homework to do  laugh   no   i came home from uhm the two exams and i was exhausted  hungry  i stayed here until six just six thirty  eating  hmm  and then i drank coffee and chocolate so that i wouldn't fall asleep on the way home  laugh   and got in the car six thirty and got home at eight thirty  and just sort of walked around with the baby  hmm  and uhm went to bed  i had to practise for the next day for p   playing the piano  laugh and so i got to bed around one o'clock that night  hmm  and up at eight and we all went to church  but in the afternoon my professor came from nova scotia and so we got to uhm talk and uhm discussed careers  that sort of thing  and then uhm i had her over for supper  roast beef and potatoes and vegetables and pie and ice cream  mhh  and after that uh more playing the piano and go to bed and up to montreal again this morning  hmm  so i made it  well ya i was really  cos i drove all day today and  left at ten o'clock and all night friday night   yes   yes i have to do that next weekend   i have to go to new brunswick again  far  so it's going to be nine hours plus nine hours  ya  we had an argument  ah ah there was a whole bunch of people word  stopped for beer after  it was really fun  short phrase   it was really great   i would have loved to go but i didn't know where the place was  well it was just around the corner on mackay  there   is that right   ya it was  oh oh i think almost all the guys went like alan  and peter and andrew and freddie   and uhm tammi and barb   and   and uh liz and elise  and  ya   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   great stuff   ya there was about sixteen people there  mhh hmm  ya it was fun  it was really really fun   how how long did they stay  till about six thirty right  s ya s ya ya well  in fact there were still some people there when i  when i left so ya they were still there  i think mostly the people had gone by  ya between six thirty and seven  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so but it was fun  liz was going back to matane and   uh i don't know  so uhm there's a lot of people are coming back  d oh ya you know now   who's all there and who's  not   yes   yes there are a lot there  most of them  ya 
Canada	 ya we met our two new professors today   and uhm the first morning the first part this morning he assigned us gave all our assignments  and readings  which seems to be a great deal   hmm  but we got them photocopied and we've got them all  and the uhm one in the afternoon just had one text with exercises  word   and it's uh but we have   exam two exams on this friday and assignments due  and it's going to be more challenging than the first three weeks i'm quite certain  ya   ya probably talk to you more about that when the word  takes over cos i you  can't say anything really  specific about it  that's   mhh mhh   ya   so it's uh   i don't think i'm gonna going to go in the afternoon though  i'm  for that course   it's quite interesting because he's very up-to-date   good laugh   again   i couldn't sit through forty-five more hours of it  he's an excellent teacher  oh that is good  that that is even  better  ya   mhh hmm  but uhm  he really goes to town  hmm  when do we get our marks from the other things  two weeks  is that right  two weeks for the other ones  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  huh i wonder if the they'll be available before that   i don't know  you mean to see these   i wonder if you like if they're  going to hand back the exams sort of thing so you can see what you did wrong  i think if you want to see the exam you have to go to the professor  oh  but you don't get them back at all   oh ya  that's usually the way with final exams anyway  ya  ya  huh  oh well  mhh hmm   oh am i ever tired  i'm just whipped  i was just fine until i got in that traffic jam up there and now i'm really really tired  did you meet any childhood friends at the wedding  yes i did yes  that was very interesting i must say laugh   pathetic laugh   there was this guy that like is a real like real  from very far back in my childhood   say grade five  and he at by grade  fi five six i think he had failed already twice and he still wasn't doing that well  mhh hmm   and i sat beside him in class and uh and  he was you know he was kind of attractive  he was a cute boy and he was already thirteen and had a little bit of you know peach fuzz on his chin   mhh hmm   and i was eleven  thought he was just great laugh   and but he was so dumb laugh   and you know and i was really really good   that didn't matter did it   but i sat beside him and the teacher had and we were right back at the far corner uh from the teacher who was right at the front in the other corner  and he'd say jerry   and he'd go what's the answer what's laugh the answer  and i'd say ten laugh   and he'd go ten laugh   she'd never know the difference  oh dear   so you met him  ya but you know he was sort of in my life all the time you   know   mhh hmm   i think he went out with one of my best friends in high school  mhh hmm  and but i you know i didn't i didn't   go out with him or anything like that  what's he doing now   but i've known him off and on  well he's working at at the ford plant  and uh  mhh hmm   has been for years  ya has been for years  and i've known h   he's he went out west and married a girl  brought her back when he was in his twenties  and she was there too  mhh hmm  and uh laugh and uh   he he uh they both really always at a function always get really really plastered and like really embarrass themselves and everybody around them  and uh i was just it was just humiliating   laugh   but they do the same thing everytime  ya they just like lose control   everyone's used to it   mhh hmm  uhm he was saying i really want you laugh   i've always wanted you  you're the woman for me  i should have married you  and he always says it  you know we'll just be standing together and he'll say this and then his wife will laugh come up just in the middle of it going that's right jer that's right  and i'd just walk away laugh   and then his wife was getting sort of peeved and   it was really awful  people they shouldn't have free bars at weddings laugh  they should make people pay five bucks apiece for those drinks and then give them the money back at the end of the night  don't tell them they're gonna going to  do it laugh   mhh   cos uh there was some younger g  girls there who are friends of the bride's daughter   and they were really really out of control  mhh hmm   they were really bad   they must have been quite young  well the no she's i know she's my age  she's forty-five and she's got a twenty-   t two year old daughter  twenty-one   okay   mhh hmm   twenty-one i guess  and uh her friends are real  they're they're deadheads  mhh hmm  and they they go around in a painted-up v w volkswagen microbus following the grateful dead all over the states and you know wearing hippy clothes and stuff  i don't know laugh   back forty years  ya   ya things haven't changed much  but i sort sort of grew up in that house  they were as a family with five children and they were all really close in age  like my friend angie was a twin and i was actually  sue 's friend first cos they went to seperate high schools  mhh hmm  so i met her angie  through sue and then i hung around sue or  angie more because she had uh a kid the same age as mine  we were both housewives together and sue was single and fancy-free  okay   and and uh but you know  in high school i knew their brother elton   he was just a bit older   but i didn't know know the youngest and the oldest that well even though they were not that different in age  but you know when we were in our twenties and thirties i got to know them a little bit better  mhh hmm  and uhm the it's a really nice family  i know the parents really well too  they weren't at all well  you know it was such such heat and uh  they're they're close to eighty  the parents  and it was really a difficult uhm time for them  cos they they're very good hostesses and they think they have to run around and you know make people  happy and serve food all the time  mhh   ya   and you know it was just too hot for that stuff  ya   too much for them   it was it was too humid too hot  it was unb unbearable just about  but it was a lovely wedding  it was they had roses everywhere  and uh it's a beautiful beautiful huge like park-like uh uh uh yard garden you know in their   uh around their house  mhh   and they had lilies and a this  beautiful arbour with clematis growing over it and they hung wedding bells and had uh had the wedding there  aww   you know chairs facing this thing  mhh hmm   and then they had tables out in the  the other part of the garden  and it was just you know just  like this pretty much  mhh hmm   you know nice and nice and  comfortable  yup   the the second day was really hot but we came back for a visit  so uh words   so it's hot in ontario now   oh is it ever  was it cooler in the townships  mhh hmm  we had rain  each day  oh   oh did ya you   oh no  a little bit at night  but no in the daytime it was just excruciating  we were planning on going to down to  the beach and uhm the it we couldn't go because there was too much bacteria in the water   ya algae and  no it's uh sometimes uh when it gets really hot they  they have uh fecal coliform in uh that  mhh hmm   it makes you itch  ya it it uhm the e coli bacteria  proliferate when in ya  mhh hmm   and oh no you just get sick  it it i don't know if it was that kind of pollution when i was kid but when i was a teenager you wouldn't go in lake erie  but you know after that it was fine  you know they made all kinds of laws about companies and   municipalities putting sewage and you know crap chemicals in there and  put in there   mhh hmm  and uh and it's been pretty clean ever since  but it's just been really hot  so you'd say it's getting better now the great   the great lakes   ya i don't know   i i when i asked about it they  i we i had a bit of an argument with one of the girls from vancouver  she was saying how wonderful vancouver is and how horrible st thomas is and i said well to tell you the truth i didn't even like it there because i get up in the morning  cos it was kind of a trip to see mountains  i'd never seen mountains before  and i get up in the morning and rush out to see the mountains and every morning there'd be this brownish yellow haze along there cos   it's quite industrial  mhh   the wind blows the from the sea blows   the pollution and it the mountains are there and it just stops and hangs around there  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and it's a big city  it smells bad  and you can see the pollution  and i said look it's polluted there  you've got smog   so this was at the wedding  no it was the next yesterday   ohh laugh   and well she was just being a grouch anyway  but you know just to defend st. thomas i said at least there's fresh air here  mhh hmm  we don't have smog  and she said oh you you think there's no pollution in toronto  and i i'm not talking about toronto  it's polluted in montreal too  it's polluted in toronto and it's polluted in vancouver  i'm talking about the difference between a small place and a big place  mhh hmm  ya   and the fact that they've got those mountains there   so she likes it where she lives  ya mainly because it's far away from the parents laugh  you know her parents and her parents-in-law are ah   are both in st. thomas and  but they're all quite old and feeble  ya ya  i wonder why she likes being away  ya i don't know  she's probably g got her life centered there now  ya   but anyway   i don't know like it is kinda kind of  disheartening  we were both saying that  to go back there because it's uhm it's   sorta sort of depressed there  you know the whole economy of the place depended on the automotive industry  and then you know and the last recession   all the factories just closed right down  everybody's unemployed  it's got a really high unemployment rate there  mhh hmm  and there's nothing really to take over  it's building back a little bit but it's not like a touristy place  it's not it doesn't have any geographical drawing card  there's no mountains  there's no there's a lake but it's a few miles away  mhh hmm   used to it was it's there  because of the railroads  it's halfway between buffalo and / - > and   detroit between windsor and toronto  yes   it's exactly halfway so all the railroads converge there  mhh hmm  so it's a real railroad town  all the nice houses were built by railroad men  is the railroad still active  no  you know how you know how they closed down railroads everywhere   yes yes that's right ya 
Canada	 so there's just a lot of empty tracks with no trains  on them all over town  mhh   mhh hmm   there's still some trains go through but not that many  and they don't have irving j.d. irving ltd. to buy it  ya ya  i don't know what they're going to do with everything but  mhh hmm  is that what irving's buying  all the the train tracks and everything  yup   as far as i know  and he uses them too   a lot of bucks there   there's a lot of uh freight that goes through  mhh   mhh   ya they should save the trains   he's a busy man   you drive through maine now to get to new brunswick and you see a lot of irving stations   so it's he is expanding   ya ya   he does he live somewhere or  so so he doesn't have to pay canadian taxes or   something   bermuda i think  ya something like that  but his three sons are still in st john  in fact my sister works in the office  oh ya  so uhm  so where did you grow up in uh  in a in a village of two thousand in the middle of the woods in new brunswick close to grand lake  it was a mining town  brick  there's a lot of clay there  and the woods  forest and irving  so most of the men worked at the mill and the railroad was a big deal  that's why my parents moved to this village  because of the railroad  but then my father uhm lost his sh   ya ya he was with the railroad right  yes he was an engineer and his father was an engineer but then they had to cut and so in nineteen sixty-two he lost his job as a engineer and started uhm greenhouse and flower shop business  oh ya ya  so that's what he did  uhm he bought land and started a nursery and  that's pretty enterprising  yes  huh  that's how we grew up  huh  and at first the flower shop was in the house and so there were leaves and ribbons all over  and lots of times when you ate there were  there was fern in it or whatever  laugh   laugh   no one really minded  huh  and then our house burnt uhm   one of the   yours too eh   mandy 's did too  mhh hmm   one of the boys forgot a lamp  he he used to read a lot and he had a bunk bed  and he had the lamp perched somehow on the bunk bed so he could read at night and no one would know that he was in there reading  but somehow the bulb uhm got onto the matress and smouldered and smouldered until it broke into a flame  and the house was badly burnt but we lived in it for three  y years for five years  until my father built a new house beside it  oh wow laugh   it was exciting   it was very nice for the children because uh  not for the parents because there was horse hair and   and uhm lath and plaster always falling from the ceiling  but for the children it was great because we could mark on the walls paint on the walls do whatever we wanted  laugh   do our homework on the walls  it was great  oh  ya  and then uhm we didn't move into the new house  my mother said we will not be moving into the new house until it's finished because your father will not finish it if we move in before  oh  but word   so that's why they didn't fix the old house eh  that's right  but one night uhm a rat or a mouse some creature ran across their bed and that did it  the next day we began moving into the new house  laugh   mhh  ya  d did so did they t tear the old house down afterwards   yes   are they still there in that same house that they built  uhm mhh it's a beautiful house  my brother bought it and he's living there with his family and my father built another house for himself  hmm  uh he just built that five years ago  and uhm it's got a lot of cedar  and once again he he is started uh his apple orchard and raspberries and potatoes strawberries and  great   he's thinning out the trees in the woods and  hmm   there are there's a  stream at the bottom of the hill and there are lots of wildlife  hmm   quite a few wolves laugh in fact  and uh he enjoys it out in the woods  and the children enjoy it when they go and visit  cos they get to  oh really   that must have been an interesting life word  there   it was interesting in that uhm we were allowed to be children for a great a long period of time  even in grade ten no one was really going out with each other  not until grade twelve did they start laugh   did you have to go away to school or was there a high school nearby  high school right there  five hundred in the high school  five hundred in the elementary about  what's the biggest city near there  fredericton  oh ya  i two words   i've never been   i've just sorta sort of been zooming through new brunswick to get somewhere else  i hadn't really i've never  spent very much time   this is what people do   my husband worked with uh research and developing in the tourists with tourism new brunswick and  well we stayed in shediac a couple of times  yes  ya it's really nice there   yes   pretty little town  where we'd stop and go to the fish market  pick up some lobsters and go back to the big lobster and  and eat it  mhh hmm   eat lobster under the shadow of the big lobster  mhh hmm   you know the guy that made that big lobster  i forget what his name is  no no  have you seen it the big lobster  no   it's this huge huge huge huge lobster  he made uh we have a huge huge elephant  in uh st thomas  because there was this this  elephant that died there  a hundred and  ten years ago  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   okay   barnum   ya the  was it  ya jumbo  from the ya from the  circus   ya ya   okay  and he was killed by a train in st thomas so they have   a rec erected this   this jumbo statue   the children have a poem in their nursery book about jumbo  oh ya   it was really funny because this statue came on two flatbed trucks all the way from new brunswick  so they you know took pictures of it and  like the the legs up to about the knees were on one and then the rest of the knees up were on another flatbed  and then they had to attach them together  mhh hmm  and uh he the he's dead now  the guy who made it before he did this his big claim to fame was making lawn statuary laugh and now he's made this big lobster in shediac  so has he gotten more contracts  well no he's dead laugh   oh   and uh jumbo is sort of falling apart  and uh he came down to fix it once and then he died  i don't know what happens now  mhh hmm  but it's a bi big   it's it's gigantic  it's absolutely gigantic  i think it's just ten percent bigger than the real jumbo  was   what what is it made out of  i think it's  i don't know like cement or something  it's it's really hard and ya  something like that  mhh hmm  some kind of  ah it's not plaster cos it's not it's not at all  you know you can't damage it that much   but it's it's quite impressive  they had a big fight about whether it should face   whether when you came into town you should see jumbo's head or his rear end   and uh it it was finally decided that jumbo should be facing st thomas  and and the whole city you wouldn't believe what a big deal it was  laugh   the city was completely divided  nobody was uh ambivalent about this  agreed   they they were either heads or tails about this laugh   it was like no we absolutely have to be facing the city  no we absolutely can't have his ass towards the incoming laugh  drive or traffic   mhh hmm   and uh what a thing like  for for one thing they were split on whether or not we should have a stupid statue anyway  and uh then you know then  when we when it was decided we were gonna  going to get it then then there was a big fight about which way his tail should be  so now the visitors get the laugh  incoming  ya   but anyway  only when you go out do you get to see the real  st thomas   laugh   so shediac and st thomas have something in common  mhh hmm  actually it was a big drawing card  i know when i worked in the post office a lot of people uh  from from the states and stuff would say oh we came to see  the the jum jumbo the statue of jumbo   mhh hmm  you mean you read the mail   laugh word right   hmm  you mean you read the mail in the   no they'd come into the post office and say where's jumbo  ohh   we came to see the big statue laugh   hooray   i thought maybe you were one of those post ma'am's pronounced 'marms' word   read each snippet  laugh   but i have my own little tour of st thomas  i there's lots of cool things there to see   uhm somebody about sixty years ago this engineer built his own house  and it's kinda kind of in a poorer part of town now  mhh hmm  but i don't know it was probably nice when he built it sixty years ago  that was probably in the what thirties  and uh he made all the bricks himself  he manufactured the bricks  mhh   and he had people bring him things to put in the bricks   yes   he had big piles of things as he's making the brick  mhh hmm   and in the edge of it he put uh clam shells  plastic toys bits of coal and lots and lots of pottery  like blue mountain pottery smashed up and the  pieces put in  mhh   mhh   mirrors uh watches uh scissors nail polish bottles  you name it it's in there  it's just fascinating  there's like ah dolls little dolls   and like teapot spouts  sticking out of the bricks  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh  laugh it's really interesting  now he   a great big two storey house with a great big double garage and every brick has got something in it  okay   oh that would be fascinating  it is  and just like the people who own it now are are  is the grandson of the guy who built it and he doesn't mind  okay   you know i'm always taking people over there to look at it   to look   in the sun it just glitters you know cos it's all  this stuff  mhh   so that's interesting   so did he uh bring his family up in that house  yes  and i think you know his son did and now his grand  grandsons is  i think that's how it went  and i happened to be doing municipal ennumeration or something  and i went around there and uh he was there  he didn't live there anymore but he told me that he how he built it and  everything so   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and it was actually word the guy  so you didn't know about it until then  ya ya i did  well ya i did  i always knew about it cos you know we walked by  everybody did   some people don't surprisingly enough  cos it's on a back street  and when i say oh you know when i tell them what the coolest things about st thomas are they uh   they don't know about it 
Canada	 and we have a magnetic hill that's just on a concession road that just not everyone knows about  you do   mhh hmm  that that i understand cos i've   talk talked   i haven't seen it but other people who've seen the one in new brunswick that's a big deal and there's postcards and everything said that  it's it's ah  better  ya a better effect  mhh  cos there's nothing around eh  there's no just just the uh   the optical illusion   ya   it really really works too  mhh  but  so did uhm  oh i forget what i was gonna going to  say laugh   what so what's cool about your hometown  if you were gonna going to take  somebody around   the people   laugh you go around and introduce them to people  ya i could do that too   laugh   there's a word of characters   oh i know what do the what do the   young people do in the on the  weekends  what do people do on the weekends in your town   where in st thomas   uhm they go to london london, ontario laugh    laugh   they get out of town  they drink a lot  there's a lot of bars there   but when you but when you  were young they didn't do that did they  when i was young uh well we have uh uhm a resort or whatever like the lake lake erie is just maybe fifteen minutes south of town   so especially in the summer every  weekend we'd go down  to  you know go swimming or   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   okay   yes we have grand lake yes   there was a great big huge dancehall there so every weekend we'd go down to the dances there  hmm   the stork club  mhh hmm  it was supposed to be the second biggest uh dancefloor in north america or something  it had springs in the floor and guy lombardo used to play there all the time  ohh  ya ya  and there was it was really big in those days because the railroads were  it stopped when i was young but but  my parents and you know people that came before them  yes people were traveling   actually port stanley was owned by london and st thomas was in the middle and there was a railroad from london to port stanley  it was called the l and p s  yes   mhh hmm  it went through st thomas and back  so everybody from london the a lot of people had cottages down there or even if they didn't they would uh take the train down to port  and it'd let them right out on the beach  and they'd take their picnic hampers up this incline railway  mhh hmm  and uh i'd have a picnic  there was a place called picnic hill  mhh hmm  just lots of picnic tables up there and it looked all over the lake  and uh there was a hotel up there too i think  and uhm then then there was a great big bathhouse for people to change in   mhh hmm   and and the beautiful beach  beautiful lake there   and of course when i was a teenager there there  the train didn't run anymore and uh people still drove down cos the fine wasn't that big for drinking and driving in those  days  okay   but they used to go to the port the stork club and go to dances and then go back to london afterwards  and they could drink and it didn't matter  but then they started cracking down on liquor and  and drinking  and so people didn't want to go down to a dance and have a few drinks and drive back cos they'd get busted so   mhh hmm   it actually when  when i was bout about  twenty-six the burn the storehouse burn stork club burnt down   and almost everything uh great down there did  used to have a huge ferris wheel  the bathhouse burned down  the hotel burned down and and  the stork club burned down   mhh hmm   so but anyway it's still i still take the   k kids you know i still go down there  it's still a beautiful beach   well i'll tell you what they do in chipman for entertainment  what  well they usually uhm drink and race their  cars   laugh   but there is also the chipman drive-in which is watching the bears at the dump  laugh   and people go down with spotlights laugh and watch the bears at the chipman drive-in  laugh lots of fun   jeez i just turned on the c b c canadian broadcasting corporation today that people in killarney park   uh there's uh like a wilderness park near toronto and people go there and try to feed the bears with one hand and take pictures of them with the other  laugh   laugh could you imagine   well if the bears are well fed and don't have little ones then you're okay   i don't know   it's pretty dangerous   yes   they have very long claws   but i can still remember when i was four years old going to the train station in our pink and grey ford  there were four kids and my mother  we would drive to the train station to pick dad up  he had been gone for two weeks usually and he had this huge metal lunch can   and uh we would wait and wait at the train station for him to come in  and my oldest brother would be the only one allowed to get  out of the out of the car to check if the train was coming down the track  laugh   the rest of us had to stay in the car because we wanted to remain dignified laugh   laugh   and uh because i had one younger brother and then two older siblings  and uhm i can remember him running back and telling us that the train was coming and then you would start to hear the whistle and then you would start to see the smoke  and it was so gigantic i it was you know when you're a little child and there's this huge machine coming in  ya   it was just uhm overpowering   but then uh your father   ya i was fascinated with trains too cos they were in my life every day  huge  ya eh  but then your father appeared and all was well  that was a really common thing in st thomas cos most i don don't a lot of my friends  their fathers worked on the railroad which m  meant which meant they didn't see them very much  ya  so it was like essentially it was a a   city with a lot of single moms in it   mhh hmm mhh hmm  you know that had to take care of business while the husbands were away  ya  ya they had to make some big adjustments when the husbands finally came home to stay you know for one reason or another  yes   lost their job or or retired or whatever ya  and dad tells how about how they used to spray alongside the tracks in order for the bushes to die down and how it was poison spray  and now when he thinks back that herbicide  and of course the spray if the wind was blowing right would blow back in your face and   mhh hmm jee  sometimes he would bring us home blueberries that the train had to stop and it just so happened it stopped in a place where there were  blueberries or whatever  mhh   he would pick us some bring them home  ya i reme remember one of my best friends her dad worked on the railroad and he used to go to the states all the time so he's always brought them back stuff  mhh hmm   you know things you couldn't get here  mhh hmm  ahh or you know things that were cheaper there or whatever  mhh hmm  or the tricks they would play on each other uhh as workers  co-workers uhm with the train  like one guy was always asking the other guys for food  he'd want a little piece of whatever they were eating  so one time the guys decided they'd really get him and they  melted some ex-lax onto a donut so it looked like chocolate sauce and they said sure  and he took some  and then they hee-haw about what happened afterward   laugh   did he ha did he ever uh see any accidents with the train  you know unclear word pick up my friend's dad   uh there was a bridge that went down once and we have pictures still of the train that went into the water  it was quite a disaster  but it happened even before i was born  my father was i think twenty years old and he's seventy  now  mhh   and there's pictures of him standing on the   the cars that went into the river  hmm  uh other than that i haven't heard him speak of any accidents  there were uh trestle bridges across all the things  yes   and this is so stupid of us but when we were kids we used to  unclear words across the  tracks laugh   yes we did too   ya   yes  what were we thinking about laugh   risk   ya  breaking the rules  they were the trestle bridges were  across the gulleys  do you use that word  something we that we  say  in st thomas  only   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  cos up here words instead of   but we didn't have too many gulleys  we had deadheads in the river  those are old logs  because they used to float the logs down the river  oh ya   in fact my brother was drowned because of one   that's funny beca  because it's funny how you said c   cos </} because you know that's totally foreign to me   like   deadheads   ya logging or anything like that cos there's nothing around our place like that  ah   and my my roommate my uh classmates   three of them were killed in grade eight because of accidents connected with logs  one down at the mill  a big machine ran over him  one uh she was just walking down the road with her boyfriend and a log truck turned to go down and the logs stick out the back hit her head and she died   ohh gee  ya  and another one it was her sister that died  she was walking on the side of the road and a log truck went by and hit her and she died  hmm   so it's m i don't allow my children  to laugh drive their bikes in cookshire in quebec because of the log trucks that go through there from the states  back and forth   oh ya words   hmm   it's dangerous  one little boy died last two years ago  the trains were a big uh thing in st thomas  like there was uh we knew a boy who was just about my age who had his arm and his leg cut off because he tri   a lot of times the trains would stop and they'd block the road so you couldn't get through and so he tried to climb across   and the and the train shunted  while he was doing it   hmm   uhh   cut off his arm and his leg  and and no he was like an example for the rest of the city  don't you ever go near the track uh the a a train    don't you ever try to go  across the train when it stopped because look at what happened to that boy  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   well there was a boy in lennoxville that just uh  one jumped off the track before the train got there and the other guy did not jump off  and he was in a coma for six months  he's out of the coma now but he has to learn how to talk and he's seventeen years old  jeez  and he can understand what people are saying to him but he cannot form the words to answer back  uh   they had a big uhm chemical scare there eh  they evacuated everybody about  just  the week before we came here i think  yes   yes   but   yes but everyone was calm about it 
Canada	 it wasn't a big deal  hmm  uhm when i was in grade one we had we all had to go to the high school  this is quite a traumatic event  we all had to go to the high school to see a film and i had never seen television before  and the film was on a huge screen  how old were you   grade one  we were six years old  wow   and it showed some children on a train track and the train came and then it just showed their lunch cans or whatever as if they  were squished   eww   and it was just i was traumatized  by that and i had dreams about it and still i'm it has   it still affects me   this movie they showed us laugh in grade one  ohh   now that was to keep us away from the train tracks  it was really tempting to go  cos you'd have to wait sometimes  they i think they they   made a law or something that they couldn't block a  a crossway for for you know more than twenty or something like that after a while  be but when i was a kid you could wait for it seemed like an hour  and we were on the wrong side of the tracks from the uhm from the fire trucks and the ambulances and everything  like that they were all over here  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so actually the property values were less on that side of the tracks  wow  because the wardass tracks went right across and ah the big freight trains would cut off the north side of the city completely  from from   mhh hmm   then you'd wait and wait and wait and wait  and it was really tempting to just like  the the thing that links them is only this big  i can just hop over that  mhh   take me one second  but then there was that boy with the one arm and one leg laugh   mhh   you didn't want to do it  mhh hmm  so but now you know hardly any trains at all  mhh hmm  i sorta sort of miss it  it was n nice   kinda kind of living in deauville cos the train was right there   you could hear it   i could hear it  ya it was fond memories of back home  mhh hmm  must have been i don't really remember the steam trains although there were some when i was really little i think  i'm not sure but  i don't either  my father talks about them and  about the boiler and filling up the boiler and tense moments  phrase   ya   mhh   but i don't  we had television ever since i was born  i don't know why  i think my uncle bought it  like i was born in fifty-one   we had a television and i remember one day there was a woman screaming on the television and i must have been three years old and my mother said that's it  laugh   cos the three little kids were sitting there watching this  laugh   laugh   out went the television onto the front lawn with a sign  television for sale   laugh   and we never saw it again   i remem remember   i remember watching the coronation in fifty-three  yes  i do  i do  i really do  i don't know if i really do or i i  just think i do but laugh i i  really like ya i rea really   you're word vision   sometimes you sort of review your memories  and i know i think i knew  even then that it was significant  and that it was exciting and everything  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i remember that and ajax the foaming cleanser ads  laugh   i remember climbing down from the supper table so i could go in and watch  laugh   ajax the foaming cleanser singing   laugh   oh we didn't get any steady diet of television at all  the only time we saw it was in the summer if we went to visit our grandmother  hmm  other than that   so did you mostly play with each other or did you have lots of friends around  no each other  my brother had two friends that lived  they were called the lloyd boys  there last name was lloyd and they were just a year apart  he used to play with them and they one time went down to the river  and they cut the boon that held the logs  a boon is a uhm it's just a rope   of logs held together in order to hold all the logs in  mhh   they cut it and out flowed all irving's j.d. irving ltd.  logs down the river  the police came to our house to investigate how this rope had been cut and they all said they hadn't done it  and then  they were about twelve years old  then one of them said that the other one had done it so they each said the other one had done it   laugh   and then the police took them in their car  and i remember being terrified  he was six years older than me  ohh  and i asked my father where they had taken him and he said oh to jail just as casually   laugh   cos i think he was uhm he was   thinking it was good for the boys to get this lesson right  so he just says it casually but for me it was terrifying that he would go to jail and never come back  ohh i see  but uh i think they just received a slap on the wrist as if you know don't you do that again  my brother burned a barn down when he was about that age  ya the guys almost burnt down a house  my si sister   my little sister was with him  mhh hmm   and i think he couldn't get it out so he came home  i don't know what the whole story is but it burned down  right down   see my father was very concerned about that always  about fires  because something had happened to him in his childhood  ohh  so uhm   was uh was everyone home when your house burned down  did you guys ever unclear word    no we had all gone to visit my grandmother   in woodstock  but your brother got out alright   uh no one was home   so he brought these oil lamp not 'lamps' in and  no it was just a lightbulb uh hanging from the bunkbed   and we had left for the day and so this bulb  was burning into the matress and  gradually   oh i thought   oh i see oh   oh i thought you said an oil lamp  it was filling up  no   oh  ya it was just a   oh jeez   yup  so someone called us and said that the house was burning  and then when we got home yes it was quite black but it was still standing  all the neighbours had come over and dumped things out the window  they all had a fine time laugh i think  laugh   jee   ex excitement   some excitement in chipman   laugh   i remember the day that uh my brother brought home two hippies that were travelling through  laugh   they had come from b c british columbia on their harley-davidson and wanted to hitchhike back just for some excitement  and so they my my   brother crated their uh   we should pull out the recipe right   cos we're doing two cups of rice     phrase   okay  should i peel the cucumber  i think so  ya  i think for sushi ya  and like cut it in strips   and so someone has to fan and someone has to stir  okay  i'll stir and you can pour  can pour this in  pour that in  ya  okay  but do we  wait ya you pour this in  that's what we did   we need three people  you pour it in  it doesn't tell you to steam in that  but we'll pour this in after this is in  mix it  wh and then mix it well  if i understand english   and mix it  the rice first  where's our wait where's our   big wooden spoon  ya  it's 15 seconds of background noise   so pour all the rice in  well two cups   oh only two cups of rice  only two cups of rice  oh no  should we do it all maybe  ya it says two cups  oh no it doesn't  it says two cups of dry rice  two cups of  why don't we just do up all the rice and then  ya it says two cups   cook two cups as package makes about five cups so ya  okay that's about right   there's only about a cup and a quarter of dry rice  oh  oh okay  well i'll just put in that much  that's a lot of rice  so i'll pour this over  words   words rice  ya   are we on  ya it's going  okay  this stuff is <down to the bottom of  damn  what should i do about this   all the stuff here  take a teaspoon  ya i'm just gonna going to   ya 17 seconds, cooking background noises   until it's room temputurature  it's <-gotta has got to be found   uh it well ya that's what it said in the lost kitchen   i think his parents word   you think these are thin enough or should i cut 'em  them one more time  i think you should cut 'em them  one more time  you think so  ya   eww we have to cut the fish  that should be pretty weird  oh the fish and the avocado  mhh   it's like the prettiest food has to wait   mhh  isn't it   that is   it's really  so they didn't have any other raw fish tam   they had lots of raw fish but the man there said it not like the what he said the white fish probably wouldn't be good  and they didn't have tuna   what else could you use for sushi  squid octopus  ya we could've gotten really exotic   i hope this is  it's okay  but does it have to be stirred until it's room  temperature   i don't know loud banging starts   i think words   i just words     you read about this stuff banging stops   do you want me to try for awhile  are you bored  no i can do this  you wanna want to cut the pepper   or   sure   cut the pepa pepper   where's my line   i think i need a cigarette laugh   i'm sure word one person's supposed to turn it right  well that's what  oh it's supposed to be turn   it's like turn and fan   turn and fan at the same time  you didn't find that wooden spoon  oh it's there  ya it's in the sink   is it in the sink   i can turn and fan at the same time  do you have like a sushi woon  wooden spoon spoon like an actual sushi spoon     hmm     something like that drawer rattling starts for 20 seconds       hmm rattling stops,   have you noticed that it seems to be  you know the one i'm talking about  it's like this ah this high  words   oh that one   and it's really good to spread with eh  yes   you haven't seen it eh   yes but i know we've got it  i haven't seen it in a couple of weeks because i've looked for it  you know i wonder if we used it camping   i think i remember

you mean  ya  it's sticky rice  i hope it works   so some are going to be completely vegetarian and the other ones are going to be meat  or are we going to mix the the  vegetables and the tuna  i think we should  or mix maybe avocado  no just   i think i think we should like each  wait  we could we could we've got ten noris right   so we can do like some vegetarian some   i would like some with like vegetables and salmon but no avocado  okay   i know that's specific but i don't really want any avocado  oh salmon  i think it was tuna  ya it's salmon  just salmon  okay   so i turn it like over  mhh hmm   fan it   are you supposed to really go for it with the fanning  cos you kind of need two people do it

really long slices  like if i word   no i just mean like instead of doing it in blocks cos then you'll have to  ya  what i was going to do was cut it to about there   slice it like this so that each piece will be similar in length right  mhh hmm   you know what i mean  ya words   you think i should just   no no no i'm going to cut it like this and like this  so they'll be one two three chunks  and each chunk will be similar in length  oh  that's okay  is that okay  yup  this is really vinegary  ya  i'm sorry/[>  even with all the rice in it  ya   >  mhh hmm   well keep on word   well i think it needs more sugar  okay  cos some of the sugar got stuck to the bottom  it didn't dissolve in the vinegar  three or words added it word  i'm sure we can  but not just straight vinegar sugar   we'd have to melt it with with   ya  what did you what did you do before you did  you did rice vinegar   rice vinegar and sugar and salt  ya it's fine  you you heated it up  ya  ya  ya  ya   ya   cos if you just put sugar we'll just like  you'll taste the granules of sugar on it  ya it'd be kind of weird   but then not vinegar  well we can just heat up a teeny bit of water  and dissolve the sugar in it  ya  that would be really wet laugh   get it almost so there's no water left   then just let it boil away  does the fish feel okay  oh ya it feels fine but really hard to cut uh   two words   do you want a serrated knife  no i actually think uhm that long  the big huge one  the big  you love that one  laugh my favourite knife   mhh humh  this one   yeppers   like that much  it called for three tablespoons   well it's basically dissolved   i'm cutting it really thin or i'm i'm  trying to cut it as thin as possible  okay   and i'll just let it boil down  i think we should use this for wasabi   definitely   phrase cooking  hmm  like we'll boil it down so there's almost no liquid  oh oh oh  and that way we won't get it so wet  uhm i should probably get more cigarettes  do you have any jan   no  uhm well yes i do but i need more  tammy could you grab me a pack  yup   and there's money in my bag 10 seconds silence   so how do you make this  you just mix it with water until it's pastey  that's what it says  mhh hmm  so how much  a teaspoon   just put that in first  ya like a teaspoon  and then you just do   like you need just a little bit of water  like you can just sprinkle it in with your fingers   i love wasabi   i love raw fish  wasabi's just word   we'll have to we'll have to   wasabi kay okay  things that we'll have to translate   wasabi ya   wasabi uhm  what's what's the name for seaweed  nori   nori   nori   how should i cut the avocado  good job on the salad  is it too thick you think  no  i think when you eat it in a restaurant uh well it's usually  what's it called when you put the sush the sushi  the meat just on top of the rice  is that that's sushi    that's sushi   that's sushi  like they're usually quite thick  that's right  so we're gonna going to roll them though heh  ya  ya  we could try a couple of little  tammy was thinking of trying the uhm   like putting the fish on top of the rice with a bit of wasabi in between and then wrapping a bit of nori around it  like just a slit like a putting the rice putting the fish on top of the rice like you get in a restaurant  and just wrapping with one  strip of nori  okay and just wrapping it up   mhh hmm   this is very strange  it's very tasty  should i have washed the fish before i started cutting it  oh no i don't think so  you don't think so   you think this is too uhm pastey or do you think we need more water  more water ya  so you can sort of dip it  but it's usually kinda kind of   word   hmh ya i guess     two or three word this is fun whispered  it says to let it sit five or six minutes   is nari really approachable  oh ya  ya he's awesome  ya  he's a really friendly guy  why you thinking about going to copacabana  copacabana  should i try that   you should

was so beautiful like you your teeth melted in it  and you know like the trouble with squid sometimes  it's too tough   just like too rubbery   so you know what he does and we should try this sometime

if i got like two nights at the   mia miami     word   i don't know if i'll make any money there though  you make money in the evenings  you do  ya cos the people the regulars i think tip fairly well   there's there's a fair amount of   students   how much how much  did you make like on a regular night at the  bifteck ya  a night   at least sixty sixty bucks in tips  monday three words would be about  including your wages   well you get five dollars an hour basically so for  four about four or five hours twenty make about eighty dollars a night in four hours   that's not bad  four hours  you wouldn't leave you would leave here  at eight thirty and not get back until four  hmm i guess i'm thinking of saturday nights  on monday night well thursday to saturday you work four hour shifts and

between three hundred and four four hundred   and more if you work extra shifts  all i know is that i had extra money and i never had to worry about it  ya  you could save money if you worked in a bar

Canada	" ya so sorry  made a little noise there uhm lighting my cigarette  ya no don't worry about it   but uhm what are the chances of going camping again before we start school  ooph well i don't know  i mean i'm supposed to start i'm supposed to start like next week  monday is when my contract  contract actually starts monday   ya  but the meeting with like the department meeting is only on the seventeenth  which is a wednesday  so what i was thinking of doing was going in monday  just to sort of get a bit of a feel of not "" feeling for"" the general of atmosphere and the cegep coll&egrave;ge d'enseignement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et professionnel and that  mhh hmm   cos that's when that's the first day   it's the students' it's their their called  de journ&eacute;e le word   ya  and i'd like to see if i can get stuff done on that day such as getting keys made  sure sure so you have to be here for monday but i mean   the weekend itself   ya   the weekend f the weekend following   that  no i mean this this immediate weekend  this weekend here  just because it's you know   oh the weekend following would be labour day right  no  when's labour day  no this weekend this weekend here is the weekend of the twelfth  okay  labour day is only on the uh labour day is the fourth of september   oh okay okay but   ya we've we've got like you know four weekends yet before labour day  ya i tend to think that uh september will be busy  the highways will be crowded  ya but i'm thinking i'd like to take this week like use as much time as i can this week to sort of airplane noise heard overhead starts prepare as much stuff as i can  you know prepare as many lessons as i can  this week   including the weekend   including including  the weekend   ya  well no  i mean i don't know  i don't wanna want to be working   ya but  it's lovely  living close to the airport isn't it  ya  but uhm well i just feel that already we haven't done so much this summer and already so much of it has gone by you know  yup   true airplane noise stops   true  but uhm i suggest next weekend   but then next weekend you   you know not this coming ne   not this coming weekend   but next weekend cos it'll you know it'll be  okay   ya   well actually that weekend i'm probably gonna  going to be in a panic cos it's the weekend before  you know classes start on the monday   mhh hmm  but actually i think maybe it might be a good idea  that way i'm sort of rested and relaxed and it'll force me it'll force me to have everything ready like by friday  maybe ya  i mean i mean i can get the camping stuff ready  would presqu'&icircumflex;le be too far   if we leave if we leave on the friday   see the problem is i mean you know i'm supposed to be working  until  well i'm supposed to be  again i mean i sorta sort of feel guilty  with the school at the school i only have a meeting we have a meeting on the seventeenth  now does that mean that i have to go in on the eighteenth also or do i then  what's on friday   you know the department meeting is on the wednesday  no department meeting's on the thursday is on the thursday from ten to twelve thirty  okay and then you feel you must show your face on friday   you know unclear words   i don't know  i don't know if i should  am i supposed to  uh you know is there stuff that i'm gonna going to  wanna want to do you know  or is it stuff that i could do  cos on the seventeenth what's gonna going to   happen on the seventeenth i think is that we're going to get our schedule  mhh hmm  uhm you know at which point i mean i'll be  i'll be sort of walking around and looking at the classrooms  where they are and and uhm and and we'll also ya and and from there also setting up i guess my office hours  finding out exactly how the how uhm how  the office hours work  i mean how many hou hours   you know are are you expected to be there for so many hours et pronounced "" eck"" cetera   et pronounced "" eck"" cetera you know  mhh hmm   sure  uhm where you where you'd have to work on a friday what's the earliest you think you could get away  oh i don't know  maybe maybe if i just go in in the morning and do things it's enough  mhh  you'd be free to roll at one o'clock  ya or maybe two or three  hmm  you know cos if we roll let's say roll at three   we're ready to go at three  and we wouldn't bother with the small  we'd stay on the four oh one major highway   we wouldn't bother with the small one   ya we'd just go straight down the four oh one  that means we should get there by   probably take like well three and a half hours for sure  cos it took about four hours to get  didn't it  but   is that all   what time did we leave   ya i think it took it took  about six and a half hours to get to sand banks but i think that's because we took we got off the four oh one and then from kingston to sand banks you go through that small road there  sure   remember and we had to wait for the ferry   to to go across  you know to get across that little river  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   ya  uhm and that i think that's why you know it sort of took   do you think it might be very busy  i mean we we'd we'd we'd get  there late at night  i don't know  we could call   ya if we leave at three we'd get there at seven let's say  mhh hmm  but i think then if that's what we're going to do we should probably call and and try and reserve a place  mhh hmm  you know you get there at seven o'clock at night are you gonna going to then if there's no room are you then gonna going to start  you know driving around to other uhm   well there is nothing else  three words   there is nothing else   that's it  there's nothing else in the area  because then you get off the four oh one then i mean we don't know how long we have to drive down from the four oh one to get   what kind of road is like  ya and what the road is like  it it won't be more than an hour  probably not  no  but we could do that  we could call  ya  i mean it does get uh it gets dark sooner   already towards the end of august  ya   you know it would be like  ya   but i don't know like i know we just went but   i i want to sort of feel like i've done something with the summer other than just work around the house you know  so you'd like to leave this weekend  well no i don't want to insist on this weekend  i just want to be sure it's done  i just want to be sure it happens   and puff how long are we gonna going to  put things off you know   ya   as far as that goes and what do you think i should do  should i just give no thoughts to uh employment until just you know the very tail end of august   you mean to work in the schoolboards  in in the schools going around to the schools   so you think it's just a case of   you think it's just wasted time   is it just wasted effort until uh puff   i i mean really if if  i didn't get anything in june it's just going to be last ditch  positions now   ya  but the thing i think would be interesting is to  call  well see that's what i have to do  i have to call the i have to call the uhm  uhm the the lavalle there the lavalle school board   cos they have to send me they haven't sent me the the sheet that you know your experience hours of hours of teaching  experience   but uhm   ya but but   what's what's it doing word    so i have to get that cough   excuse me  well because i'm thinking when i call them to ask to find out about that when i ask them  when i call them to find out about that   ya recording fault   as i was thinking when i call them to ask about that  form that they're supposed to have been supposed to be mailing me now uhm i can also ask them if the schools  like if if you know if the schools   are open  sort of like if the principals in the schools are already working  or the you know  mhh  if the if they're already in there it's probably better to go there to go to the schools   and talk to the principal  it'll probably be easier to talk to the principal if he's actually there  if they're actually in the school and not in some you know  uh meetings schoolboard-level meetings   but if they're actually in the schools it's probably better to go talk to them then wait till sort of till the teachers start working you know  and then the teachers are in the school and you've got all   that sort of confusion starting  mhh hmm mhh hmm   ya it's just that you know i mean   i mean if if you're the one  that's come and try you know that that   comes to it for the sake of dropping off a c v it's just ya  it's it seems like wasting their time and they give you such a cold shoulder  cough   no i don't think so  you don't think   i didn't feel that  the school where we did work there   uhm where we both fit  oh la rose ya   remember  i mean la rose actually got to us got to put uhm   invited us into his office and spoke to us briefly and told us that  he i think he isn't he the one that suggested that we should that what we should do is go up to each individual convenateur of each level   ya ya i know but  you know he was nice  i mean you know what ya we're begging for work but eh eh you're also offering a service  i'm here to offer my services in case  because by then a lot of principals might know if some of their teachers   uh you know as the the woman said there at the schoolboard all kinds of things happen can happen  over the over the summer right  i mean the teacher decides not to work again for whatever reason  has an accident  is sick  hmm  uhm so at the last minute they're stuck with like a full load to fill in   ya ya   you know it's it's just a matter of going in and saying you know hey i'm available if uh if  you need me  mhh hmm  uhm you know i've had this this this experience  ya  i'm willing to do this or not willing to that  or i guess maybe you shouldn't laugh say what you're willing or not willing to do  but on the other hand you know if i just   well if i contacted jackson   well for instance if if if janis  calls or the other woman calls and you know with her school where she does want to offer me something i think i should grab it  you know  but i i would go to the schools first   i would i would give the schools priority   hmm   ya but i mean that means waiting till october   no it means it means   doing something now   well   okay waiting till when  waiting till when "
Canada	" waiting in making it schools first until when  until the the tenth of september  no go making your rounds  making making a first rou  round   m m making  just making a round of all the schools  first round word   mhh hmm  and then seeing if you get you know  you may get something right away  uhm if you don't then i would go to the language schools  well in between that some at some point   i mean i'm gonna going to make phone calls and see if anything comes up you know with  idioma   with idioma ya   there's also with the the the school not the school but the uhm huh the  saint laurent board of trade there  uh uh chambre du commerce that  i mean when things start happening like you know these breakfasts uh these breakfast things i mean if i'm not able to go to them cos i'm in class you  you know you should probably go  ya i could always go   it's just a matter of sitting down and having breakfast or sitting in a group of  you just pass your card around you know   laugh ya  ya right sounds really easy  but  but you know i would try the i would try out  those two possibilities first and see what if anything happens there  and then go to uhm you know private private  language schools and uhm and and and sort of and say that you're available sort of you know either in the late afternoon or at night or in the evenings  or sort of book yourselves give yourselves  give yourself some complete free days  well i don't see the point of that  either i do full time as much as i can get with the private school or i do full time or some kind of contract at least with the school system  and and you know i don't see the point of of splitting up   and i know i know  it's always it's always the same problem    i don't see any point in splitting up availability one way or the other  it'll just make you less attractive to both you know  ya ya ya cos you're not helping matters  i mean it doesn't help you if you know if   you're free on tuesdays and thursdays and to   teach in the schools but what they need is someone   for to   replace for three weeks   no no   it'll never work out it'll never work out on on on a weekly basis  it'll always be a nine day cycle for some word  ya  so uh i think really i should if i'm  gonna going to wait and try and get something through the school board i should just  if if i'm gonna going to wait first it's one decision and then after that i should give myself a date after which it's no longer number one priority  you know where i switch priorities  ya cough   but really i mean if this uh i'm tempted   if this uh if this friend of janis'  if this woman does call and offer me  i'm tempted to take it because   ya depending on the hours that she offers you   ya sure but any minimum number of hours  it's already gonna going to be better than sitting on my ass you know  it's it's { > it's gonna  going to word <   well not in terms of pay  still in terms of net income you know   ya sure ya  it's either it's it's you know it's either   what's the what's the proverb  one bird in the hand or two in the bush   one bird in the hand is better than two in the bush ya   ya you know  but uh  i mean there you've got a sure thing  you you know that you're gonna  going to have so much money at the end of the week or the end of the month  mhh hmm  ya  cough   but uh   and i mean it's  with jack i kinda kind of  feel that  oh i mean the the other two are fine  they're you know they're very pleasant to us but i feel that with cherie there she's a bit sour i mean you know  and again as i say if they find out that  you know i i they they   won't be very keen on  but it's been months since i talked to them   i wouldn't well   i don't see what it is to them  i mean they've got in the contract that you can't go  after their employees after their clients   so   so word   that that shouldn't bother them one way or the other  you know  ya right   that's true that's true   alright   ya   but anyways to get back to camping i mean would  would presqu'&icircumflex;le be okay for you  it's not too far   no if we uhm  you'd have to come back sunday night sunday day   sunday afternoon   ya if we leave friday then that means we'd camp there  friday  that's kinda kind of just overnight really  saturday's the only  saturday's the only sort of full day  full day there  well i mean gustaf tells me that they've gone down to they've gone down to herman island where we were   and camped just for like you know labour day weekend  ya   mhh hmm   and that's a lot further away  sure  but uhm the only thing is tape cuts out for a moment   look at uh name in the window  you can see the dust  if if it's from her or from me and the fridge i don't know but  oh the dust flying around   you can see all the dust flying around  ya   ya ya   but when when did we go to uh what's it called gatineau the gatineau park   last year   wasn't that in september  or it was late august early september wasn't it  mhh hmm  and that was too cold for you  ya it was cold at night  but uhm   well besides the racoons  but this is on the  it's a bit further south  the lake will m make it cold i guess wouldn't it  because it's a peninsula  ya  ya so which is another reason to make it   to sort of go   it's not high   it's not high you know  it's not sea-level but it it's nothing like up in the gatineau hills  so you know it should be warm  ya  so we'll we could go  you know we could go this weekend cos that way we could leave friday morning  mhh hmm  you know it would just force me to get more work done  two words   that's all  you don't have to show your face until monday  mhh hmm  okay  see in that way maybe honestly maybe it would be best  because that way you've got all of friday  you know y you y you  could get up super super early  be out of this town before rush hour starts  yup yup and be back you know and come back sunday  you know   sunday night sure  so what should we do  should we call and find out reserve a place  i guess ya  i think it would be it would be  good i mean if what it will cost   i mean laugh the price of a phone call is better than spending all that money in time and gas   sure cos when you're out there there's nowheres  not "" nowhere"" else to go out there right laugh   ya right   unless you wanna want to push another two hundred miles down the road to go to that uh  gitchigoumi place we were at last time you know  no no   sand banks  no no no i mean when we went out west  down by  the island you know  down by spanola or whatever it's called  espanola or whatever   oh mani man ma   manitoulin island   manitoulin island   uhm ya  and we do you think we should ask uhm  helene or uh sam   when do they go  i thought they'd be going  when do they go  they leave uh they leave on the eighteenth i think they said  yup next friday  not this friday next friday  look i think it'd be more interesting with  with   uhm we get along fine but i mean with with   more than two people it would be a little bit more interesting  it would be more interesting with more people  i think  ya sure hey i think it   not six  forget six because you'll never coordinate six people's activities you know  well but that's okay i mean it it you know as long as we make it clear that we don't have to coordinate six people's acti activities   if we go down in we're going down in two cars  ya hmm that's true  but uh  you know i mean i don't know uh uh i don't know if  i don't know if if uh if we can't go if just helene and sam can come and we can't fit them in the car i don't know if they'd be willing to rent a car for a weekend you know   i doubt it   cos i mean they're spending a lot  they don't have that much money and they're spending a lot of money on this trip to this trip to scotland  you know it's costing them a hundred and fifty dollars each  a week  to do what  to rent the place right  cos they rented this house or this apartment or  or whatever through this rental agency in edinburgh   mhh hmm   so it's costing them a hundred and fifty dollars each a week  there's four of them  ya  so that's like six hundred dollars a week for the house   the problem with that is i mean why go unless you're going to see the town and get around a bit  cos uh if me uh if i  if i was paying that kind of money a week i'd feel i had to stay put and and get my money's worth from the house that i was in you know  in the house laugh   ya but i mean it sorta sort of sounds expensive but if you think of it it means twenty dollars a night  sure  you know  and you're not going to find in europe  you're not going to find a place   ya well there's no question unless you want to unless you want to stay in youth hos   hostel   u unless you  unless you go in a youth hostel   and then and then what time you come home at night that's  you know and then when you do   when you do get there you got people snoring you've got the  stinky feet  you know   ya i mean it was fine when we were eighteen   ya ya ya   ya ya   no that's not worth it  ya  but  so it's not that it's not so it's not   expensive you know  i mean if you consider that you're sp  it's costing you twenty dollars a night to sleep  sure   cos even if for two you get a room for two  people  eh bed not even   but can they cope there   oh well ya  it's a house  fully equipped and everything  got everything  got a t v a v c r a you know   but if they have plans of renting a car  ya and they also want to rent rent  a car  but wouldn't you need a i mean don't you need an international licence  i don't know how much it's gonna going to cost   i recall   probably   i don't know  maybe you do maybe you don't  how long would you last driving in england  oh i wouldn't  god i can i can hardly  drive here  would you even try   i wouldn't  i wouldn't wanna want to do it  ya i know but well but you know  helene said that they're they'll  be driving on little country they'll be driving out in the country  and it's not that bad  well because maria and and  corey they had rented a car when they had went to ireland  they drove around  and apparently corey said it wasn't it wasn't that bad you know once you get laugh used to having  laugh to drive on the other side of the car and the other side of the road "
Canada	 uhm you know they drove around for about two weeks or so  ya but then your first experience of it will be in a city where you rent the car  your most likely place to have a problem is when you start and where you start is heavy traffic   hmm but i don't know where they're  i don't know where they're located uhm where the house is like in edinburgh </}   if it's right downtown or or you know  so does it mean that then they won't need the car if they  when they stay in the city  you know will they be  well they probably won't use the car anyway unless they're far  they'll probably use public transportation if it's  but the car's the same problem  once you've rented it it's costing you money and  you feel you have to use it  well ya you want to use it   ya  it's a vicious circle you know  ya well i don't know what they're doing with the car  maybe they're just renting it for uhm maybe they're just renting it for a week   how long are they going to be then  two weeks  two weeks   hmm   cough ya so they're leaving friday morning  they're leaving friday morning from here i think and they're driving down to toronto with uh you know those uh allo stop  carpooling service uh things  mhh hmm   and i think they're sleeping in in  uhm toronto friday night  cos i think they only leave they only leave   saturday  they'll be spending enough you know  mhh hmm ya  and that she was telling me that uh riverside  uh have uhm uh the the the head the head of the department  was sorta sort of like tried to make her feel guilty because there's a workshop on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of august or something that that that  you know that he said is compulsory  you know that all teachers should be that all teachers should attend this workshop  and you know she just said she couldn't you know  ya  and he just sorta sort of tried to make her feel guilty laugh about it but cough   so i don't know i mean can we think about  what should we do  should we make it a definite that we'll   i i want to go camping before the end of the month you know  and and the longer we leave it  things will happen  ya okay   there'll be some reason  this reason will you know   ya ya ya i know you're right   you're right ya  i think we should do it this weekend because next what if on you know what if i say next weekend then i find i'm in a total panic because i have to do all this work the weekend before   classes start   you you're going to be in a panic anyways   you're going to be you know  cough   it wouldn't matter what you did you'll be in a panic you know so  yup that's true   ya okay good  so then we'll uh we'll call   we'll call the place and see if we can reserve uhm  reserve a place for friday saturday  mhh hmm  so at least this way we get   you know if we leave early friday we're there   you know if we leave like at seven or eight  could be there midday   hiccup   excuse me  ya we'll be there at midday so we have the whole rest of friday and  all of saturday and sunday  i mean we'll see how much time it takes us to get there  so there'll be no sense  there'll be no sense putting this stuff away  and sunday   you know i'll just leave it downstairs  now that was your uh that was all planned  wasn't it  yup  means we'll have to go through all that again laugh  and hang out the hang out the  sleeping bags and laugh dry everything out and  well that will give me something to do while you're at school   ya  and we could make more of an attempt to get things ready foodwise  yup yup   you know   ya sure you know we could make something  something like uhm i don't know  if we make some chuli   can you freeze it  sure ya we've frozen chuli   remember we've we've done it  we've made batches of chuli and put it in yogourt containers and fr and frozen   it  mhh hmm   it because it's always   well it's it's especially if you're camping   you know i mean to have something hot at night a meal that you've actually cooked or warmed up you know i  it makes you feel much more   uh well i mean sandwiches don't interest me much you know  ya i know  i know that sandwiches don't interest you much period   uhm ya sure ya  and then if you know i mean ya we can have  planned sort of food and meals  and and ya as much as possible uhm you know we could just sort of have to if we just heat up   you know like if one night we have chuli   mhh hmm  i mean do you care one we could take my car if you wanted   do you care one way or the other  mhh uhh  no we can take my car  it's not a problem  okay   you gotta have got to learn how to drive a standard this  ya right  why don't we make that also a uh   and then i don't have to get up every morning  ya ya i think we should  no but seriously we should make it make a  point before the end of the month that i learn how to drive standard  just words   at least to be able to back out  mhh hmm  smash into the other car  right   i mean with the with the company downstairs there with the company i mean that will just sit and wait  right  we'll we'll leave that be until   early september   well i say until   no i say until sort of like that until the seventeenth   when i get my schedule and i know when i'm  you know when i'm teaching and when my office hours are and you know sort of figure out see when my free time is  but that's still summer  isn't it wasted time aren't  isn't it wasted effort contacting companies  no  all i'm saying is that i've got you know  that that's when i won't be ready   you'll have some spare time   ya i won't be ready to call people before then  you know   mhh   and then so that means  sorta sort of like the last two weeks of august  the week of the twenty-first and the week of the twenty-eighth  you don't think i'm thinking that  uh trying again whatsoever in summer i e before the end of august  is wasted effort  that it nothing really will have changed  people will either still be on holiday or they'll be just back and  you know   ya but i mean a lot of people said that it's in september you know beg beginning   l late oct  october late august beginning of september that they'd be ready to make those kinds of decisions  i could look  i mean i've i've kept stuff on file  you know people that i have talked to and what they said  ya   you know cos in a sense i mean if we only get sort of like one or two contracts you know at least get our laugh   get back some of the money that we've put in you know   and sort of stay even   anything at all   okay for this   for this we   for this we can't  something else i mean we haven't been doing a lot of cooking here you know  no  uhm do you wanna want to  plan could we plan something   you know major meals each weekend  each weekend  each night  uh major proportions so that we can just take something of each meal and uh freeze it right right there you know  ya ya  i think it's a good idea  ya i know we we sorta  sort of lost the habit of doing that  i mean cos we used to do that more often  like make big chunks of you know big pots of  of vegetable soup or that harira soup  remember that sort of that sorta sort of   that   sorta sort of hot soup   mhh   that'll be nice   that'll be nice camping   ya okay so there you go  for the next two days you've got a project laugh   you can make chuli and you can make hariras  except soups except soups  uh for camping i mean they take up a lot of volume and it's not a lot of food  they waste a lot of space for a for a  meal that's not very  well a yogourt container  i mean we're just it's just two  two nights we have to worry about  so   okay ya  no but i mean i'm just giving that as examples  we can there's other stuff that  we can make   chili's good   chili's good   ya chili's a good idea  uhm uhm quiches  oh you can't you can't  transport a quiche  i mean i i it's  it's a  word it's it's    why not   well ya what do you do  what are you gonna going to do   words   ya you can't put it in the fridge  you'd have to almost uhm  we can make a a a thing of pasta   you know pasta that my mom makes in the with the  penne in the oven that's with broccoli and  and uh   like lasagna sort of  ya but it it it's all  we can make we can make a bunch of that  and take you know take some of that camping  i mean that's sort of that's a nice meal  well what needs doing housewise as far as  are there any other projects that we haven't done yet around here that now or never  no i don't think so  i gather if i understood your dad was saying that some guy's gonna going to show up for the balcony  ya some ya that's why he was just telling me if if you know if you see the guy and he has some questions you can give him my number but  so   mhh hmm  okay  that stained glass is so nice when the   sh sun shines through it like that   mhh hmm   ya we should have janis over soon again   mhh hmm  ya  oi yoi yoi   well your parents won't be upset will they  what if we take off  ya again   no  i'm thinking i wonder if  i'm saying i wonder if we cou we could  you know get them to come with us and put them up in a motel somewhere but that's  that complicates things  that's that's   well it's sort of iffy because we don't know the area  we don't know where the hotels are   how far two words ya  ya the i mean the whole peninsula's a park isn't it   i think so  i think that's what it looked like  ya the whole tip  the whole tip   so they'd have to go they'd have to go back to the four oh one before they'd find something  ya ya  or otherwise even like the the that  sand banks area  i mean it wasn't very  remember we sorta sort of looked  we stopped in a couple places  i mean it wasn't it wasn't  very nice  mhh hmm   no  also i mean they're not gonna going to   get off at six in the morning you know  no   no they would  they would  i mean just recently when my uncle was over   when my uncle was here from italy and they went to ottawa there uh to quebec city that one day  remember and i went out drove out   to to sort of  cos i gave my uncle the gift i   i was sending to my aunt  mhh hmm   i mean they were sort of upset with me cos the   they were waiting  they were ready  oh ya okay 
Canada	 you know it was eight o'clock they were ready to go laugh  they were just waiting for me  hmm  ya so my cou cousin   my mother the other day was  well did i did i tell you that my  i talked to my mother the other day she was telling me about  ya i told you about my cousin her  cousin ya   jack ya   mhh hmm  ya he's uhm three words  second marriage on the rocks   she hasn't had any more uhm tremors or anything your mom  nah nah she had she had an appointment she had an appointment yesterday  was it yesterday  ya with this doctor  a sort of you know stomach doctor or whatever   uhm that the doct doctor   when she was in the hospital that the cardiologist  had sort of uhm  i don't know if it's a cardi cardiologist  probably not the cardiologist but the doctor the m d   that was that was there  mhh hmm   the g p that was looking after her  uhm he's he he's the one he gave her this specialist's number and said you know make an appointment with him   so that you know see what he says   and after waiting  she waited like three months to get an appointment  and yesterday  sorry and it was yesterday  mhh hmm  and she called before going for some reason  i don't know why   mhh hmm   she just wanted to check the time  that it was the right time  mhh hmm   and the secretary tells her that uhm what do you mean  didn't didn't uh didn't somebody call you to tell you that the appointment was cancelled because the doctor's on vacation   laugh   cancelled or postponed  it was postponed but i mean didn't give her another date  it was just it just said you know the secretary insisted   i mean you know my mother said no one called  you know nobody called me  but she said and the secretary insisted  that she was right because she said in my book here i have  you know there's a note saying that the person was contacted that you were contacted and told that you know the appointment was postponed  hmm  so my mother was really upset  i mean and now she can't get another appointment i think before october with the guy   is that the only reason they came to town yesterday  no no no uhm no cough   no no cos the appointment was in laval  it was in laval centre   oh okay   but i mean so the thing is she didn't end up going to the appointment  mhh hmm  so i mean she was disappointed but it was ah  it was good that she called because had she gotten all dressed up  and and uh you know gotten there to find out that you know  but i mean i i told her she should just relax about this  she knows what her problem is  laugh she just calms down doesn't get so anxious and upset  she'll have less stomach problems  mhh hmm  you know and she said well you know i thought i'd go just to see what he says  you know maybe he'll change my medication you know  and then maw mom laugh you know  laugh you've had this problem for tons of years  for years   mhh hmm  but uh no now she's she's going i think it's it is next week  it's monday and tuesday that she's going to a hospital in st jerome or something for all these tests these uh for   the heart   but i think maybe my father was right you know  i mean cos he said right from from the start that she's got no problem with her  it's her stomach that  and the doctor also said that  that it could be sort of like the stomach problems  that could  i don't know what the problem   well i mean at the time i didn't believe my  fath father like i didn't want to believe my father because i'd you know i'm just thinking he's just it's just wishful thinking on his part  you know he doesn't want to believe that  well that's the one side of it but much more apt i mean  how  what's he's going to base his opinion on  what does he know   you know what i mean  you're talking about   well he says he just he says that he knows my mother laugh   sure but you you're talking about reasons why he wants to think this or that  i'm saying regardless what he wants to think he hasn't got   i mean he unclear words   well i mean he just says that he knows my mother and he knows that she gets upset and anxious and whatever and that  uh because it is a strange a strange  sort of coincidence that that she never has stomach problems when she's on vacation  whereever it is that's she's vacationing if she's in italy or f  or you know or mexico she says she never has stomach problems  fine fine but  and she says she eats and and and  drinks   sure but we haven't we haven't   really really determined except for what your father says and perhaps one doctor whether it's a stomach problem or a heart problem   well i mean there's definitely a stomach problem  but the but what i think is it's psychosomatic  that a lot of it is  maybe there there is something there  cos i do believe that we all have s  sort of weak points in our body  you know that when we're stressed that's what's gonna   going to hurt  like i mean some people get splitting headaches  mhh hmm   uhm some people get backaches   mhh hmm   you know some people get stomach aches  you know   sort of that's where the tension comes out  so that i mean in that sense it's psychosomatic  and i think that's what   it might well be  my only point is still that your your  father will have an opinion sure but if it's only an opinion  i mean he hasn't got anything  well ya sure he's not a doctor right   you know   but sometimes i mean nor do doctors know for sure laugh  right i mean laugh with all this  basically all this medication doctors give my mom i mean a lot of it is is sort of just tranquilizers laugh   you know like librax  sure  and then sort of antacids and you know sort  of almost over-the-counter stuff you know  right   well how would you feel though i mean if if  if you had some major problem some incident and you know and you went to hospital and the doctor said well maybe it's your stomach maybe it's some problem with your heart and i said aww it's just your stomach aww come on it's   i mean how well would you   i might be trying to reassure you but you wouldn't be terribly impressed with with me playing it down   cough   ya ya i see i see what you mean  ya ya i think i'm sure she's still anxious about  you know in in her mind she's still not sure what it is that she has  well i mean frankly if breath   but she's had she hasn't had  any problems any more problems     sure but i mean if if i   ever had anything at all and and you started diagnosing me well i mean laugh i wouldn't put much worth in it and and i'd let ya  you know   you wouldn't appreciate it would you   thanks dear  well you know laugh   i mean what if i hear a funny sound in the engine and you gave an opinion and i didn't think much of that  i mean that's a  ya sure but i wouldn't give an opinion cos i don't know anything about  well do you do know something about my heart  laugh no i don't know anything about that either  well  ya so i guess looking into sort of like teaching overseas   i do think that uhm i mean i i   didn't really think that we could sort of like aim as high  as universities you know as teaching   in in universities   mhh hmm   ya  i think there though   but whe i mean but we   i think our problem is we've got about three priorities and we haven't decided which is  the first priority laugh   ya you know i mean do we want to stay here and get the license  yes or no   mhh  if we do is it worth all the assisting with it  then that's   you know it seems to take forever   that's one priority  the second priority is   well not priority but a a decision  do you want to leave the comfort of your house you know  and if so for how long  how long would it have to be to make it worthwhile  i mean six months even six months in another country is is  is fooling around  you're not going to get something worthwhile  mhh hmm mhh hmm  ya sure i agree   you you you'd / [ >  just about have to stay a minimum of two years you know  yup or one year for sure  well you wouldn't tell them one year  mhh hmm ya sure ya   mhh  ya so we should remember that then  the guardian on tuesdays and the times the times literary supplement british newspapers on friday  mhh hmm  or educational supplement  although how long do they take to get here  no eh eh i'm sure libraries get them on the same day  how could they  why would they   i mean if they're made to come out on a certain day in  in england  well sure you can get the day's the day's papers  well you can get the new york times on the same day  you can get   new york times is one thing  ya well no cos i'm thinking of la repubblica sort of the italian newspaper  uhm but you can get it  i think there's one day like in the stores there's one day or in certain you know certain stores there's one day a week where they where they do get the day's paper  like maybe it's every friday or whatever  depends on when flights come in   mhh hmm  but we can ask you know  ya  cough we can ask where we where we can get ah where we can get a paper on the same day that it comes out  ya because i agree with you  i mean it's pretty useless if you read it a week later  mhh hmm   i guess   ya but i guess   i i guess  seeing my parents we'll just we'll put the nix on that i guess cos  seeing what  seeing my parents  i mean even for christmas   we have no idea what's happening  christmas is flat and boring out there anyways you know  i mean i'll just leave it in the air i guess  what do you what what are you saying  a a about seeing your parents  well ah ah   when when are you going to see them  well we toyed with this summer  that went out  we toyed with this autumn  that didn't work out  well that we don't know   no  i mean we don't know  there's between now and and > you know between now and </} october they can come out  anytime between now and october it'll still be nice out  well they didn't seem very keen on the idea  well i don't know maybe it really is that your dad's not feeling you know maybe it is that he is really not feeling  sort of up to it because of this you know this  dizziness  dizziness ya   the the problem that he's been having  i mean i understand that  you know when i told my parents i mean my mom said ya sure i understand that  you know i mean that you don't want to be traveling  you don't want to be far from home when you're not feeling  physically fit   but i mean it doesn't mean that they wouldn't want to come in september or october  mhh i got the impression they weren't terribly keen on the idea 
Canada	" well then again i mean you know them more than i do   besides i mean laugh it's like reading the obituaries listening to mom when she comes  you know all she talks about is who's died and who is not feeling well and  all the people that   well i mean you know i'd like to hear us when we get to that age  i mean that that's what you know  ya she had said she just read uh she   she finished reading the red rosaries   and she didn't like it  ya   she said she didn't like it much  you read it   ya i read it  i really liked it  hmm  but i mean it's very  but but she said she didn't find  the the the the sort of the story very original   or the or the   like her way of her des she said she didn't find anything original   two words presentation   ya her presentation her descriptions of people and and  and stuff  she said she didn't find it uhm find it   very original  she thought the beginning boring  and she thought the end didn't really like begin   didn't really like the end   liked pieces bits and pieces in the middle  well the bit i've read from her i mean breath   provinces of hate   well that's the only other thing you've read  maybe  there were points i thought it came across a bit trite you know  ya ya i sort of felt that a bit too with the provinces of hate   i mean even though eh she's describing sort of very everyday  events and emotions and stuff  and in in a sense the red rosaries is the same the red rosaries is the same thing   i mean it's just the life basically the life   of this woman of this one woman you know  but but what i found interesting was just the the you get a description of of  or a feeling for for country  for the you know for canada   what canada was like starting at sort of the turn of the century and  why  is it set back there  ya ya it's set out west  i mean she's born you know the main character she's born out out west you know  and then her her father ends up going to the states  she ends up living in the states for a while   and then you know comes back and uhm  eh eh i don't know i thought it was interesting  it's in in a sense it's a very ordinary life  mhh hmm  but but i mean it's it's  it's a life you know  from birth to death a description of of   a life  and i mean whether you know whether  it's a well-known author or or you know  did i tell you that the first apartment that i rented here in montreal uhm and then left that it was her daughter that took it over  i had known her just touchingly from winnipeg you know just  just   no  oh   i remem remember   you mentioning something about that  didn't you say she wasn't really nice or something  well i left the phone in my name and  thought nothing more of it  and she didn't pay the bills   cough   and she ran up all these bills   ahh two hundred bucks  and then in in april maybe whoa i got something through the mail i mean breath   but what at your new address  i don't know how they traced me down but they found me  i mean i i thought it was all over and done with  i thought by now she would've you know changed it to her name and and you know  would have been gone   changed it to her name   take care of it   but no there was a outstanding bill of two hundred dollars  and and threatening threatening threatening correspondance  you know i i took it first thing to the office and i explained look i know i'm not supposed to have done this but i just left it in my name and you know and and  i'll pay you everything and  and and   ya   ya   well i mean the people down here that i saw are not the people who conducted the correspondance  you know they just said   ya ya   they were they were okay with me  they said ya   but i mean what  the end result is what laugh you had to pay this two hundred dollars or what did you do   oh i had to pay it   sure i had to pay it  but i mean they claimed at least that it wouldn't affect my credit rating  you know   ya   but exhale breath you know that's the same one who  ah but how did she get this apartment   i bumped into her somewheres not 'somewhere' and she was looking for a place and i was looking for a way of unloading   the the the ya   where you were  where you were staying  ya   and that's end of tape   now i must have been to a movie within the last year  laugh   maybe not  geri and i were were uh talking about high anxiety  the mel brooks film laugh   and ernest was just killing himself  uh at one point uhm he's uh uhm he's   at a conference he's giving giving a talk and uh on on  psychoanalysis something like that and and   he's talking   this is he in the film not he ernest   no no no this is mel brooks  right  and he's talking about sex and stuff  all of a sudden this professor comes in with these two children  laugh   these two little laugh little  kids  and uh he's talking about penis envy laugh so he calls it wee-wee envy  laugh and me and geri were just like oh my god   laugh   and and then he's uhm   he's talking about uh urine and

as they <[ laugh   one thing i did with a friend once is we were  cough trying to combine different accents and say i don't know swedish and uhm new york jewish and we'd try to like eh  laugh word   or i guess japanese japanese jewish was really funny laugh  array laugh   laugh   come up with the strangest concoctions laugh   ya i don't know  i don't i just ya i don't see very many movies  like i mean i mean you know i don't think i could sit still  i mean people rent two movies and sit down and watch two movies  and i don't think i could do  it   right   ya   i mean well i guess there was time when i watched television but i haven't had mine that thing  plugged in since i moved in  and uh   that would make a nice aquarium  i'd like to do that with a t v sometimes laugh    laugh   kinda kind of word  it  try to fix it up and  it would be cool  it'd be really nice   ya   somebody had one  oh ya  ya   i know chris wanted to do that  some where was i  seeing one  i don't know   might have been in the window of uhm astral books  some artist had one  he had an old one  and old like old fifties t v  cabinet that he'd stripped out  huh   wow   put a goldfish bowl in  put goldfish in  one or two word there anyways  that's pretty neat  one of the things i like to do is going out and uhm cough  in july doing the alleys and picking up stuff people throw out  but you're not actually moving laugh    ya ya   it's pretty uh pretty cool  that's where that came thing that thing came  from  that's nice  it's uhm i move it around and i hang it on the wall because that's what you do with something that's like that but laugh   ya ya   but uh i don't know  it's kinda kind of interesting  i have a friend who uhm who does similar stuff like that  a an artist  and uh he uhm had this mage this wire mage  and he'd do weird things with stuff he found on the street  there was a great manhole cover at the corner  of of of bloor and spadina in toronto i had admir admired loved  for years  uh huh   it was uhm had a grid pattern on it  but was cast in bronze or maybe brass  uh huh  but whereever the traffic had gone over it it was it was i mean it was it had it was  grids but it also had raised bumps  like raised squares uh on  and the whole thing was circular  and whereever there was a raised square had been polished by tires  okay   so it was shining and gold and slightly   ru like burnished and then the rest was was uh was just you know dull  it was just it was just 'a' not said gorgeous thing  and i used to always want to steal it and make it into a coffee table or something  yaa  uhm last time i was in toronto they're putting this uh   like uh l r light rail like raised streecar thing  down the middle of spadina  and the place where i was was ripped up  it was not  i mean i didn't steal it cos i thought you know it would have been it would be rude to steal a manhole cover out of the centre of a busy street laugh   laugh   anyways somebody's got it  it's gone somewhere forever  huh  and i'll never see it again  but it was a really b beauti  beautiful   it's probably sit sitting in some scrap yard somewhere  it was just a gorgeous thing  cos the sun used to hit it and it would just shine  it would be like this like this like like   this there's a gold grid in the centre of spadina when the sun was setting   wow   you know it was really weird  it looked sorta sort of wet and shiny  i just figured out what i'm gonna going to  do  i have this x-ray from from when i was down south and uh when i broke my hip  so i have this x-ray of my broken hip laugh and i wanted to do something with it  some kind of light  put it on the wall  i don't know but a a coffee table would be a good idea  put some glass over it  is it uhm yup  yup  yup  good  what's it i mean it's just made out of x-ray material  that's what i'm thinking of   i it's just an x-ray  right   i it's just  a uh a regular film  and   ya   right you're just going to build   nega negative uh build a light table  and take it in laugh   ya why not   uh hip laugh   laugh   this is somebody's hip laugh   that's it ya that's right   that's a that's a very hip table   laugh   i wanted to do something with it  there was there was a   a real story behind it  we had to get a guy from uh uhm from  nation air to bring it up to my mom and had him have it   seen by the doctors "
Canada	" and uh anyway it was a a funny thing  it was a i used to laugh always at my   little mishaps in life   how did you end up there anyways   uh i went i i just went on a trip like anybody for two weeks and i really really liked it  i was trying to get out of my weird montreal life  i was working in a bar and uhm and and   i just uh said i think after ten days if i get a job i'm not going back  and then sure enough i found a job  i sold my ticket to this uh bank robber laugh   and uh i had to go with him to the airport  and since it had a girl's name on i had to go get the ticket for him then i gave him like the the boarding pass   and uh and off he went  and that's how i got uh that's how i moved to the carribean  laugh   then i had a a house  uhm a cute little house with those uh ca&numl;a  roofs  you know the kind of uh leafy roofs all tied really tight together  and uh it was kind of nice  there were donkeys though laugh walking around the horse  yes, she said 'horse' all the time  it was kind you you   heard saying oh a horse  i remember once  i was so laugh so freaked  i heard this sound at at my door  it was a horse braying noise, sounds like 'plplpl'   laugh   and i was just oh my god  laugh   what is this a peeper laugh   laugh   this horse was was just out the window  it was uh it was kinda  kind of weird  and it uh it burned   it burned and maybe two words   for about a month  ya she told me   then i got a nicer house in the dominican village  and i was working for them  cos i was working as a uhm as a  manager for a restaurant  so i was buying the fruit and uh uh laugh i was being like the real jewish businesswoman  ah ya give me these tomatoes laugh   these aren't tomatoes laugh   laugh   this was all in spanish  so   do you speak spanish  ya  how's your spanish   ya   it's i don't practise it here though  but i i picked it up really qui  quick   i i'd been down there several times and i studied a bit of spanish  and uh but i did learn to speak the street spanish  cos when i got back i went to this uhm peruvian restaurant and i was ordering in in spanish and the guy is  laugh was looking at me  he was stunned  he was where do you come from laugh   laugh   that is like really bad slang spanish laugh and you don't learn that in school laugh   laugh   with the swear words laugh and everything  a real hillbilly laugh   laugh   spanish style laugh   i loved it  i was black  i was so tanned  i was like a real beach bum laugh   laugh   it was kinda kind of interesting  and down there like really really bad things happen  to people  we we called it nature  uhm we we just thought it was uh nature's brutality but cough   it it was funny  we'd we'd buy these little leather uh bracelets these these little leather bracelets  and we sai said  laugh me and a friend of mine said we were gonna   going to buy one for each disaster laugh you know we encountered   laugh   each really really nasty thing that happened to us and fucked up laugh our lives  so we bought one i bought one when the house burned down  i bought one when the i  broke my hip   you broke your leg   and uh and we said we were gonna going to  go home when we had them up to the elbow laugh   laugh   of course we didn't wait that long  we thought it was all kinda kind of  funny laugh   and he came back the same way  a horseback riding accident  and he he was very very reckless   he was racing with his girlfirend  this this rambo - type german chick  and uh laugh and he  screwed up  got a punctured rib broken hip laugh   and you don't want to get needles there  laugh   you don't want to get shots   right   you don't want to be very ill in a third world country   it's just cough something you you  try to avoid if you can  get on a plane  ya  ya laugh   laugh   oh well  i was in jamaica when i was five  my uh my dad grew up there  do you remember any of them  three words mumbled  ya  ya  i used to have uhm   you know an old old friend that he'd been to school with was still there   so i went to stay at his place for a little while  his farm  and then we went to this we rented this  uh cottage on the beach  uh huh  and apparently it's now a huge huge tourist development  okay  but this is in nineteen seventy  it wasn't  it was just you know like local jamaicans had houses there and there was like an old hotel you know from the thirties  down the beach anyways  and there was a coral reef off and and and   stuff  but uhm my major memory is is one day i was walked in the bathroom watching my dad shave and he had the old ra razors you know he had safety razors that were all wrapped up in paper or whatever  and i guess he was watching watching   my eyes and decided you know no no no don't you know  like de really you know told me really  forcefully that i was never to touch these  okay  and uhm he probably put the idea into my head  laugh   ya right laugh laugh   so that day i was at uh i'd come back from the beach or something and i was ja anyways and i went into the bathroom and i'm not "" i"" start taking these things out and playing with them  laugh and next thing i know  i mean i'm naked too at this point  laugh   next thing i know and there's a there's a  you know a cook or a maid and i'm crying and there's blood all down my hands and she's runnning from the hut where we were to the  the ki kitchen hut that had like a  a breezeway through it  and she's rushing along there and my fingers are all bleeding   hauling me in hauling me into the kitchen  i mean i'm all embarrased laugh cos i don't have any pants on laugh   it's like i feel really upset   laugh   but uh laugh that's my big   one of my big memories of jamaica  laugh   huh  but ya   what was your dad doing there  in jamaica  ya  his father was running a sugar plantation   uhm for tate and lyle  eww okay   and so he went there when he was twelve  and and then uhm mostly he   i mean he was in a boarding school till he was sixteen  and when he was sixteen h he   came out of the boarding school left the boarding school or whatever  uh worked on the sugar plantation for two years and then at eighteen he joined the navy  hmm  and that was the end of jamaica  wow tough life  ya his dad drove him to the drove him to drove him to kingston   put him on the ship   drove back home and died  had a stro stroke  laugh heart failure and died laugh   laugh   so uh he was a weird man ah ah my dad  huh   my dad had a was a really you know had a whole trouble had trouble with the whole fathership thing  uh huh  just cos i mean he grew up with a he grew up in thailand with a thai nanny until he was six  mhh hmm  speaking thai you know   mhh hmm   at six he got sent to england to go to school  his parents were there until he was like ten  mhh hmm  from six to ten he were no remember he well claims to remember very little   uhm going to this school  living with grandparents that that  didn't really want to know   and then then there was a revolution in  in siam  uhm when siam bacame thailand laugh   mhh hmm   and uh so much for and so that was the end of his dad's job and uh and  pension laugh   so he came back to england and and they lived in england till he was twelve   and he was a ah when he was twelve   he just he just won a place to a  no it must have been just earlier than that  cos he just won a place to like canterbury cathedral choir school  he loved to sing  uh huh  and they hauled him out  took him off to jamaica  we got a job in jamaica  bye laugh   and uh and then they and then they  planted him in a boarding school  and so he really had no idea who his parents were  who his dad was  he learned who his mother was later   hmm   but he had no idea who his father was or what fathers do   uhm and uh his mother had a twin brother who was in england which who uh later drank himself to death  and uh the only alcoholic in uh in  my dad's family that i know of  and uh and he may well have been i would just   finally realized just recently that that   this guy was probably the surrogate father  at least for the time that my dad was in england  mhh hmm   my dad loved him  he said he was a really really great man  you know really nice and everything  funny   all of my all of my dad's mother's family are all hilarious  mhh kay  ya it's wild to tell stories  i don't know or were anyways and uh  my dad once told me this story  i don't know much about it  he doesn't talk much about yugoslavia but he was raised by his sister that looked a lot like me that died when i was a kid  mhh   i don't know what that's about but  i i noticed something weird the other day  i i'd seen it before but uh since we hadn't seen each other in so many years i guess i forgot it  uhm he he never talks much about that period of his life but he does di discuss  it with people he doesn't know  and he's always very proud of saying he's slavic  and there's this little shop around my place where they sell computers and and crap and he wants to buy me a printer  uh there's a printer going for eighty bucks  and we go  and the guys the two guys who have the shop are russian  so they start talking russian  speaking in russian  and uh and he's really boasting about how he's from yugoslavia and how he's so proud of me uh i don't know and this whole thing  so now the two guys really like me laugh and all of that  but i find that so bizarre in a way  and i when i was younger i was very uhm insecure and i guess i used that a lot to define me  you know that i was from far off place laugh and things like that  i find it goofy that he still uses that in a way  sure it's i don't know it's like this whole pattern of interaction   ya  and uh i mean the whole network  there's the the whole there's a whole a whole country network for most immigrant communities  right long phrase   mhh hmm  and even like my parents are just your standard   eng english > you know brits  </} and and you know i'm sure  <mhh hmm   well they don't do it to get good deals laugh    okay laugh   cos that's not allowed  you're sup supposed   ah no you're supposed to pay the bill without looking at it  ahh "
Canada	" whoa  the english gentleman's code  it's ah laugh it's a  a probably a m an  engine for social justice in england laugh   oh we're the total opposite   ya   my dad just uh uh he he   always talks about the tax people  and he makes he's making i guess a lot of money now and he was telling me that he just got this cheque for two weeks wor work of uhm seven thousand bucks  mhh hmm   and i was like gasp laugh   oh my god   laugh   and he wants me to  laugh he wants me to go with him to buy his stove and fridge cos he just moved  three or four words on for a year    ah he wants me to go into the store and play the student thing  laugh so i get a better deal  i couldn't believe it  this guy you know like i i  can't even imagine making money like that someday and  laugh   i i just thought it was strange  laugh   so i have to play the oh i live on lentils and laugh    ya that's right laugh   will it keep tofu fresh laugh   laugh   it's so hard laugh   laugh   a friend told m me   a jewish friend told me a wasp joke  he said that ah this guy goes into a   a wasp he goes into a clothing store and   you know and he walks up to the salesman says you know uh the salesman says what would you like salesperson spoken in jewish accent   says oh i'm looking for a suit   the salesman i got just the suit for you   come on over here   and you you know he finds him one and he puts it on and he says huh it's you already   you look great   oh it's beautiful   it fits you perfectly   and the wasp goes i'll take it laugh    laugh i like it  that's similar to my feminist joke   what   it's it's kind of like along the lines of my feminist joke laugh   laugh   anyways zac zac  assured me that jewish people laughed their heads off  laugh   laugh well  oh i saw this book the other day  i i hadn't uhm   laugh   one of my ex-boyfriends had it  and i loved this book  it was the encyclopedia of jewish humour  and it's all classified and themed  it's got family women rabbis and stuff and they're really really funny stories  laugh   uhm i'll try to remember one one   this guy this jewish guy owns a fish market and he's   he has a sign over his door saying fresh fish sold daily  and this guy he comes along and says oi why do you write uh  fresh fish why do you whi  write fresh   you know everybody knows   like if it isn't fresh we wouldn't come here would we    so he has the fresh barred out  you know he paints over the fresh and so now it's fish fish sold daily  and he says oi why do have the uh the  daily   you know we know you sell it daily   we come here everyday   so the guy says oh not a bad idea   so he bars out the daily   uh fresh fish sold   uh well of course we know it's sold   we don't get it for free man   like you know like why do you write that   so he bars it out and and there's only  fish left  and uhh and so he says now is it okay   why do you write fish   we smell it a block away   laugh i don't know  these stupid little jokes  they're really cute   laugh   i had this fascination with judaism for a while   there was uhm   i was re really struggling with a god issue  i stumbled upon this book at one point  it was seven questions most often asked to jews  and the first one was do you have to believe in god to be a good jew  and and the answer  these guys i guess who wrote the book were p h ds and stuff like that and uh   a and they said that no you don't have to believe in god to be a good jew and actually the doubt  is is a healthy thing  uhm you have to to doubt everything in life  and in in practising uhm in  in following certain rules certain laws you know you will be brought to uhm to believe in uh a higher power of sorts in time  uhm i thought that was kinda kind of  interesting  i thought that was easy  laugh   okay cool i don't have to believe in god and i can be spiritual   laugh that's good  laugh okay   christian just did this course in in uhm   in jewish mysticism that he really liked  or jewish i guess it was jewish mysticism   like kabbalah  ya obviously  alright  anyways i was just at uhm i was up on on a in ah was waiting to come up to uhm on the friday   i was waiting i was killing time so i went down mount royal and i went into a used a a   junk shop and there was a bunch of trophies there and i decided well you know i'll look at what was one  what one was for  uh huh   and it was for some i can't remember  i wish i could remember what it exactly said  but it was you know for some jewish public school  and it was the annual trophy for the best for the student with the highest marks in jewish spirituality   laugh class   laugh   and i was going to buy it laugh and give it to chris laugh cos he liked that course so much  laugh wow   but then i was oh i don't know how much it would cost  probably would have only been about three four dollars  laugh   but i just thought it'd be so funny  he could stick it on his mantlepiece says "" mantlepliece""   laugh   wow   uhm james ling high school or something  it wasn't but it was you know some obviously real  plateau school from the from the  fifties or something  ya ya ya   i didn't look at the dates  one of those st st urban schools  ya  you know i should've checked huh  maybe i would've recognized some of the names laugh   did you get trophies and little ribbons in school   for   oh well i didn't laugh   no   no  the school i went to didn't have  they used they used  to have uhm they used to have   an annual uh uh   ah uh field day laugh uh   cos we didn't have them   no   laugh   which was just torture   laugh   i hated it cos they used to pen us up outside in the middle of the thing and you had to be there all d  day you know  it was right at the end of school when nobody wanted to be there  at all   uh huh   teachers students nobody  and i'd have to go out and do organized athletics  laugh and then then they then and in the schoolyards   yuck laugh   so we'd have this they'd have this  fenced off area  and if you weren't actually competing  i mean i think the idea was incentive to compete  right compete   cos if you didn't sign up for things you'd sat there in the sun  i mean nowadays everyone would scream about shade but back then nobody cared  they didn't even  i mean they didn't even fence off the area under the trees or half under the trees  it was just  anyways  i know those were brutal  they were the geeks' worst nightmare  you know after   i used to hate this watch   laugh   i was always the last to be picked for anything  laugh in sports  oh ya   so they handed out ri ribbons  for those  in the lower grade they used to arrange it so that everyone got a ribbon   okay laugh   like there'd be some kind of a team event team event where the whole group would be like you know like every class would be divided into three teams and there'd be first second and third ribbons or something laugh   whoa  but later on it was just on  i mean after a while  but in the higher grades it was run by the jocks  and uhm our school went up to grade eight  pretty soon after a while i learned that you didn't have to go to school laugh   so i just wouldn't go in those days  you know it's like i could see a play day coming and i didn't laugh a field day coming and i   just wouldn't go to class  i hated them   you know like anyone was really gonna  going to get upset you know laugh   i was also since i was six i was really sensitive to the sun and my mother had this thing  she wanted me to look healthy so i had to go lie   i i i had to go   lay out in the backyard in the sun  i'd be dying and i'd cry  i was oh my god no  uhh uhh   and she'd be pinching my cheeks and uhh  it was just n  nightmare a nightmare   laugh   laugh it was awful  she always wanted me to look cute  this i hated when i was a kid  she'd when i was i guess around eight nine ten years old she'd kinda kind of   curl my hair on the bottom  make these little boudains   and uh i just hated having to two or three words   you have really fine hair too   does it does it does it take a curl  ya ya it does  but you know geeky  i was already such a geek  you know i really didn't need that laugh   laugh   uh  ya i i went up i put up with a lot of grief cos of my name   it's uh my mother's theory was that   what's your name  steven   and uh  oh for that  ya   for steven   ya  you got grief   ya  like my first name is actually gerald uh but  after my uncle uh the doctor  and uhm but i i didn't use that name because i didn't like ger or gerry or all those other diminutives  so they decided that they was going  they'd they'd pick a name for me not for any relative for my second name that was just gonna  going to have no diminutives   uh huh   so they chose steven you know  and so i went through life as you know steve and virginie   steven segal even steven   steven the vegan uhh   even steven   laugh   about a million of them  and uhh i mean i mean i had a friend whose name was jenny and she pointed out you know if the kids are  gonna going to hate you they're gonna   going to hate you anyways laugh   uh huh   and she had a perfectly normal name  they find ways  my name was sajak   but uh   i'd be known as kojak laugh   things like that  i hated it  laugh   i detested my name as a child  i hated being different because people said that  oh kids were mean  they said europeans don't wash laugh and things like that  i just hated the whole culture when i was a kid  oh ya   well i mean i was i was a wasp  in a in a neighbourhood of wasps  that made no difference   laugh very little difference anyways   i mean the only the only the  the only essential difference in my family and everybody else's was that uh my parents were freelance writers and had no money  laugh   uh huh  you jnow and then the neighbourhood i grew up in everyone was a v p  okay  a v p of a large corporation   not quite  i mean there weren't presidents there but they were all all you know management  was that a problem growing up for you  sure   i mean that's where i ended up with my attitude  uh huh  and uh laugh you know and uh ya  i find my ahm my mother comes from  a small town in new bruns brunswick  in new brunswick from uhm a farming family  and they were very poor  that have holes in their boots  had to walk to school several miles and stuff  i find what happens with these people is that they   they don't become quite as judgmental as other pe  people   since they've been picked on a lot you know  they're more uhm tolerant  right   and it's in the end nicer people in a way because they've had it a little rough you know "
Canada	 ya  i was thinking s marjorie  and i were talking about her family the women in her family and how stingy they were  they were always judging criticizing people and uh i guess it really  had a a negative effect on marjorie   she int internalized   she said she internalized it all and  she really identified with her father too eh   it's funny  i think she was ashamed of her father in a way  oh ya   because he uhm he was a bit of a joker  he was uh not that refined in ways  and i think it really bugged her  uh i don't think anything really major happened  it's when she talks it's he's it's  it's his name that comes up  yup ya   ee that's uhm pretty interesting actually cos when i was uh in analysis i i always always spoke of my father  and my mother i just could never think of bringing her up  and uh my therapist who's quite sharp you know uh pointed that out to me  and uh it and it turned out that some of the biggest issues i had were with my mother and i just did not want to address them  and it was much easier to point the finger at my dad since he uhm cough i guess he was dysfunctional in a more overt way   laugh than my mother  uh it was just easier  ya   and also for women it's easier to point the finger at   the the guy  mhh hmm   ya   i was always closest to my mother   but i mean these days i'm talking about my dad cos he's the one that left  uh huh  but uh ya you know   but uh he was always pretty much in like a i wouldn't say like a like a negative influence or something  i mean not   i mean that story that i wrote is all about absent fathers  laugh   you know and the father's voice in there just vanishes  uhm cos he just really didn't know what to do  he didn't have any idea and wasn  wasn't   and and not only that but he just  couldn't make himself do stuff  i mean some things he just was not capable of  you know  so i'm not really angry about that  have you read the odyssey  not no   no  it's all about that  not the whole thing   it's all about uhm cough seeking out the lost father  the father is out on the sea and is lost is trying to find his  way back and is  okay   actually it's all an initiation into fatherhood for him  cos he leaves  he has a wife a son but i guess doesn't really know what the hell he's doing  right   you know what it's all about  and and he is tested along the road  and uh and becomes a father   i read i read a kid's version    okay   i read a kid's version   actually i may have had the whole thing read to m   me   my dad used to r read   one of the things my dad used to do that was great was from p probably nearly ten years  no seven or eight years  he used to read every night  hmm  i mean we started with treasure island or something and we ended up with i don't know vanity fair or n like  well just tons of  like i try and think of a list of all the books that he read and i can't  you know i mean i i constantly think of ones that i hadn't  or like all of the lord of the rings and  uh huh   and uh he used to be really into theatre  he's very wooden on stage these days   but he's got a good voice for reading  or he did anyways  he was a great reader  and so for years and years and years my my mom my mom would go sleep on go to sleep on the couch  we used to have pet rats   uhm lab rats  i had one of those   uh huh  we had a whole succession of them  albinos  ya and hooded rats  okay   uh huh  cos my dad used to work  ah he brought them home from the lab  the first ones he brought home from the lab once  and uhm and i'd sit in his lap in that chair over there  which is why i have that chair   uhm and he'd read  and my sis sister   my mom would go to sleep and my sister would sit on this couch  uhm uh and take the rats out of the cage and they'd be on her lap and then by the end of the night they'd have to be fished out from back of the couch laugh   cos it was it was a sofa bed and so it had all these real cool spaces to hide in the back  laugh   oh ya laugh   you know to be fished out at the end of the night   at one point laugh at one point we had an electric blanket which ceased to work  laugh   and it got sent back under warranty to be fixed  and laugh   ohh oh laugh   anyways they sent it back  i don't know if they ever repaired it or not  but they they said they weren't  gonna going to pay  it was the warranty was void because it  appeared to have been chewed by a small rodent  laugh   laugh   that's cute   ya   that's kinda kinda of   unusual having a rat  well people had them   ya  at least the   my dad used to joke that we'd tell the babysitters that they were burmese gerbils  oh   cos some of em them  would freak out  rats  but uh they were they were  just more fun and more clean than than   when i was punk i had a rat   we had a we had a ah i had a mouse named thins when i was really small  laugh   it eventually escaped  it was all nice too   uhm and my sister got given a hamster once for her birthday by a family that was moving away  and it wa was  happened to be about my sister's birthday so it was given to her  anyways  so there she was in her long dress sitting at the dinner table or at the at the table  you know with that hamster in her lap you know at the end of the birthday party or whatever  laugh   and along came one of the dogs  oh no laugh   laugh   and found this hamster and must have thought oh you shouldn't have  laugh   for me laugh   laugh   and so there was a crunch and that was the end of our poor hamster   really  the dog wasn't afraid  he usually would   of a hamster  uhh   the dog wasn't afraid laugh  of the hamster laugh   > laugh   the dog was right into it  the dog thought laugh this was a great idea   laugh   mhh a nice light snack laugh   a hamster oh great  this is a party laugh   you guys got hamsters laugh   these are way better than bones laugh   oh ya laugh   so that was the end of the hamster and uhm  so we got rats instead  laugh   rats would have the brains to freak out and run away   laugh   okay   a dog came along a large carnivore and started cruising along  cos you know the dogs used to hang out under the din  dining   we had a big dining room table  big   i i'm not going to herit  inherit   my sister is   but uh you know the dogs used to hang out there under meals at at meals and and you know and cruise along at lap level and  see what's happening and wait for things to come down and   and uh   laugh   anyways laugh   i i'd put my little rat   on the kitchen table for breakfast laugh   i was punk  oh  that's when i was working at foofoon laugh   oh ya   i'd be  i remember when when all the punks were walking around with rats on their shoulders  ya  laugh i worked for this one woman at this  antiquarian book store in toronto  she was really cool  she'd been a dog breeder and and and and   uhm she was just really into animals  uh huh  and she she used to raise these hungarian dogs called kouvases   huh  which were they looked like they looked like  a white three quarter scale wolfhound  okay  okay  mhh   uhm and they're i mean they were sheepherding dogs  but they're actually sheep-guarding dogs  okay they didn't they didn't herd worth a damn but they would chase away wolves  okay  okay  or they'd raise an alarm  anyways  but they're so they're very very independent laugh and pretty aggressive  anyway she liked that  she like that in a person laugh and she  liked that in a dog  ya ya ya laugh   laugh   anyways so she used to raise she used to   i mean these are the kind of dog they they could i mean they they're if if you were they they could you know  stand up on their hind legs and put their hands on your shoulders and look you in the eye  you know that kind of dog  right   uh i love those dogs  and uhm and uh one point uhm there was ahh  you know a a team of punks working at like  not like i wasn't one then either  working queen street  where one would come in with a rat and try and attract attention and two or three others would shoplift  uh huh   at one point uh you know one of these kids   came into the came into the store i was working at  and my boss said  ahh   you know and they just started heh heh look at my rat  and they were just making very overt gestures and  and uh she said i've seen rats before and if you don't get it out of here you're liab liable   laugh it's liable to get eaten laugh    laugh   but one time one time ally   ally that was her name  was was alone in the store and a bunch of other kids came in and started raising a ruckus  and anyways one of the dogs used to come   macca used to come to work with with  with them  and she'd spend her days sleeping under harry 's desk   at the bask at the back   uhm including laugh one time she slept through an armed robbery  laugh   but uhm but this time i guess ally  's voi voice raised her voice right  then the next thing they knew macca was out from behind the voice  woof laugh   laugh   and she had the store cleared laugh   laugh   but uh the robbery when harry was  when harry used to drink and he used to drink a bottle of vodka ev every almost every day  i guess every   he used to send me off to the liquor store everytime to buy four bottles of muscuskia and he'd just drink them in coffee all day long  uhh   and uhm but one day it was five o'clock  oof   it was the shift the day the changeover shift between the day staff and the night staff and i was  phone rings back there   hello okay okay phone conversation   they were back at the uhm at the back   the desk at the back and uhm so there was harry there and he tanked cos it was the end of the day and the day the day  person and the night person and macca 's asleep under the desk  oh and ally 's back there  harry was back downstairs  and and so there's three of them at the desk and harry comes up from downstairs and he's tanked and there's a kid there with a gun pointing at all three of them  and harry just sees this and so he horns in and  he laugh he says  he walks over sticks his hand on the guy's shoulder grabbed the gun and said we don't need any of that here and marched him out of the store laugh   laugh oh wow i love it i love it  arrival of new speakers; no consent 
Canada	 headlights on  ya  ya   two words i'm sure  so how did you get involved in the in the  uhm canada world youth  well the first time i uh i went traveling overseas on my own i guess was with crossroads  canadian crossroads international  and uh it's a volunteer organization  they send canadians any anyone  over the age of nineteen to a developing country to do uh a short-term volunteer work placement  by short-term you're talking  three to six months  oh  so it's not too long  ya   it's not like one of those two year commitments  or anything   uh huh   mhh hmm   ya i went there and did my bit and got sick and recovered  and   ya   do you find that you get sick whenever you go to any of these countries  well i find it's a great weight-loss program for me  i i usually drop ten to fifteen pounds or so  laugh i see   i come back i'm feeling trim   ya and then you gain it back and then  well this last time i i didn't lose much weight  in in canada world youth i had a really  good host family which was super cautious with me the group leader and  uh i i actually gained a bit of weight living with them  laugh   and uh it was too bad cos i was hoping to drop a few pounds  word   and that was in india was it  that was in india   ya ya   and then i came back here and put on about thirty  so it was like uh  ya   some of their food is really interesting isn't it  ya  it's uh like their not 'they' uh uhm have a chicken that's red  oh ya tandoori chicken   tandoori chicken  huh i love that   it's good eh   ya ya  i came across uhm a marinade that you can use to do that   like the patak's tandoori marinade  uh ya ya   the red paste stuff  and so  well this is a powder  and so uh i thought well there's nothing saying you   have ta have to use it with chicken  you could probably use it with other things   oh sure   so now when i sometimes when i cook rice i'll put some in so that the rice turns out red and  and has that flavour  awright alright   oh is it ever good  i've never thought of that  ya it's really good  you should try it laugh   laugh okay   do you like spicy food  not too sp spicy   i i i like the spice  i don't like the hea heat   the hot spices   okay   so uhm i have to sort of steer clear of it you know  it gives me a burning mouth laugh   when i was in uh india the second time i met this professor there who was he was like over six feet tall which is really unusual for indian men   for indian men ya   and uh a very stately looking gentleman  and and he spoke english very well  but he said to me you know americans are the best users of the english language he told me  and i said what  really laugh   what are you talking about i said   he says well you know when americans when they eat something spicy they say the food will burn at both ends   he said only an american could come up with an expression like that laugh   laugh   isn't that  ya they have some uh very neat uh uh things that they  get away with   ya laugh   you know i'll agree with him there  but uh but i found that their the  food that i had  while we had a a student from canada world youth uhm what they cooked was really interesting  hmm   i enjoyed it  they did some uhm a vegetable dish with cauliflower snd it was really good  alright  and uhm actually they did several dishes  the girls got together and and uh cooked a meal for us and  what did did you have girls with you or did you have guys   no i had boys  ya boys with me  but uh i got to be quite friendly with some of the girls and they came over one night and i was cutting uhm the uhm group leader's hair uh  uh laugh   really   well i always cut my son's hair and my husband's so they asked me oh well that would be nice cos then it wouldn't cost us to have our hair cut  right right   so then you know you cut one and the you got another and another and pretty soon i got the group leader there too  laugh   laugh   so we made an afternoon of hair cutting and the girls cooked up a storm there and we had a lovely dinner  laugh   well great  ya it was fun  i enjoyed that  one of the indians in my group decided to go to   a a barber shop to get his hair cut just so he could tell his friends i paid laugh twelve dollars for a haircut  laugh that worth it  ya   laugh oh boy   it's pretty funny  especially when you can pay twenty-five cents for one  laugh back there  it's funny   oh ya   ya that's what they were saying  it's very inexpensive there  so they i mean there would be no reason why anybody would do it at home  but uhm with four sons ah and a husband i decided a long time ago i better learn to cut hair   ya for sure  i i try i keep asking rachelle  to cut my hair for me you know   oh ya   so it would save us a bit of money  sure   but she refuses  she says no way  i don't wanna want to look at  ya you laugh after i cut your hair  ya you might ah laugh   might make a mistake a few times but after a while you learn  you know  and there's guides on those things all the time  y you know that you can put on  you don't even think about it anymore  i've been going to this uh  the cheapest place i've found is is  just down the street  he charges just ten dollars but i'll  admittedly it's not the best haircut laugh i'll get   in in my life   laugh   but   well you know now the kids have the really short haircuts you know maybe three words   ya ya on the side   ya   ya right  and uh so uh my grandsons they all come up to get their hair done now  they don't mind grandma giving them a haircut now because it's just a runnin running the   the razor all over their head with the guide on it  laugh   right   well uh harry who is twelve decided that he would come and get his hair cut and uh then his dad decided he wanted his hair done too  mhh   so i said okay  so when his dad sat down i said well how you know what do you want it done  he said oh i just want it cut a little shorter  just trimmed up  i said well how short  oh he said just use that long the longest guide    mhh hmm   so i did and i went right up the back of his head first of all and i said i hope you don't change your mind cos this is really quite short you know laugh   laugh   at that time it was too late so he ended up with a very short haircut all over him laugh   right   what did he think of it afterwards  uhm well he said uh it'll grow in before winter laugh  he works out in the bush laugh   he's actually he's a mechanic and he  has been working for a logging company and uh has just been in the last six months transferred over to the b c british columbia  highways department ah uhm  alright   it's er a private ent  enterprise a private company now though isn't it  i have no idea   uhm ya but it's still highways department  and so he's uhm doing their mechanic work out of north vancouver  so he's uhm used to being outdoors in all kinds of weather  you know if a vehicle breaks down they gotta  have got to go to the vehicle eh  right right   so uh well it'll grow in  because he's in the wintertime he grows his hair long and he grows a beard to keep his face warm  laugh   wow   i i used to hate driving in  in b c in the wintertime  those mountains  oh ya   and uh in nelson  in nelson a little bit   ya that's scary   the way that town's situated it's  uhm it's pretty scary sometimes   or going down that hill going in ta  in to trail   oh ya  isn't that a wild ride eh  i wouldn't i don't think people go down that in the wintertime do they  i never i never went to laugh  trail in the wintertime   oh wow   if you want an experience go to trail sometime  they have the very best italian restaurant i've ever come  across  really   it's a huge old safeway store and they've converted it to a family restaurant  the whole safeway  the whole safeway  the whole thing  and and it's got all these tables either family-style which will hold anywhere from uh six to sixteen people  laugh   and they've got wine bottles with candles in em   them and red checkered tablecloths  awright alright / [ >   the whole deal   and uh the italian music playing and uh people singing and sometimes getting up for a  dance   laugh   right   and it's just really an  all families  and when you go you uh you you give   em them your order so you decide you want chicken  well it all comes family-style  so it's in big bowls of spaghetti and sauce and  and big dishes of of uh chicken and just everybody digs in and  oh it was great  and it was so tasty  laugh   their sauce was delicious and   ya it was really good  and it's it's like here where uhm you get uh or at least at home you you get ah your meal  it includes your dessert and everything  and same thing there but of course their dessert would be  their uhm uh their ice cream uh   it's called spumoni   right right right   su su oh right   oh boy   laugh   i was said to bernie well i'm sure glad i'm not on a diet while we're here laugh   a lot of italians in trail  yes  all over the place actually   ya ya   uh when i was in revelstoke uh my my   landlord  i lived in an apartmnent with my counterpart  and he uh he was an italian  came here forty years ago  worked on the railroads you know  got himself started in a little business  mhh hmm  worked his way up you know to support a family and did okay for himself  owns a few buildings as a landlord now  okay   it's neat talking to some of those old guys isn't it  ya  ya   uhm we used to have one who lived in squamish  he's passed away now but he uhm came to squamish on a  on a boat and uh when he lived there it was just a one street uh one hotel type community  and uh if the barge didn't come up with the food and the meat  then the guys would have to go out and hunt  and they'd have to go where their high school is now  laugh   that was about where they went huntin  hunting for deer and moose and  uh huh   lookin looking to bring back all this meat to cook at the hotel  cough   and uh he married a an indian princess  oh really  ya ya  really nice family   hmm   really nice family  it was a uh he was a really interesting  we took him to the okanagan one time and uh we were  sittin sitting down the beach and he said ya i think i could stay here  i like it here  mhh   and i said oh chris how come you like it here so much  oh lots of pretty girls here  lots of pre pretty  gir girls   laugh 
Canada	 but he said i think i'm gonna going to   have sunburned eyeballs laugh   laugh   he was so funny  i th think   i think that's what would happen to me too   ya   ya he was a neat old guy  just uhm working with these cree indians the past few weeks they were telling me a bit about their hunting experiences you know  some of them have hunted bear caribou beaver you know  mhh   and uh and i tried to figure out the biggest thing that i'd ever killed and it's probably a mosquito laugh or something like that   ya me too  ya   ya i'm not big on on huntin  hunting   i i think i'd la   rather take pictures of em them   uh i don't mind eating things so i i   guess in theory i shouldn't mind killing things either   mhh no let somebody else do it laugh    laugh   one of my fr friends   well anne radfield who was a coordinator in   your year she uh she  decided to be a quasi-vegetarian  oh ya  mhh hmm   she would only eat things she thought she could slaughter herself  oh ya   otherwise she thought it'd be  well that would put me on a real limited diet  laugh   well she ate chicken but she kinda   kind of cut out the beef and pork which kind of made sense  ya   uhm ya  and i think i would end up uh   even when i go fishing i find it difficult  i like somebody else to do the kill   you know when you gotta have got to   hit em them on the head   oh ya you hit them on the head ya   ya   anyways it's not bad if it's small fish but if you are you know into the big salmon they got a baton there that   whap they hit that thing so hard laugh   they're not so big  you think it's got a huge brain and it's working on advanced   calculus   and thinking   why are you killing me  laugh   ya   ya right   or   ya maybe two words so sad   so did you like working with the cree  it was it was interesting  it was / - > uh it was quite a challenge  actually well it was okay laugh   are they an energetic people or uh  uhm it depends on what it is  if it's something they're interested in they're just like everyone else  very eager   but uhm when it came to uh doing school-related stuff which wasn't interesting to a few of them  mhh hmm   i mean they were all coming to study down   south so they had that basic motivation to to  be interested but a couple of the uh a couple of them a couple of the girls that a couple of the young women   were just they seem either really lonely or really  ya   they're really quiet really shy really withdrawn and it was uh it was hard to   to get them to open up  mhh hmm   and in fact we never got two of them to and uh  i'm a i'm a bit worried about how they're  gonna going to do in school  mhh hmm   ya  they have a different concept of time too  like we were supposed to be at the college at nine o'clock in the morning and it's an hour and a half leaving fr  from the door of the bed and breakfast to arrive at the college   and uh by walking and taking a bus and taking the metro and taking another bus  oh ya   it's quite a long time  and uh we got we got to the college once five minutes to nine and i think everyone was horrified at the fact we had arrived early for something   laugh can't have that  so we were late for all the other days  and it took me a bit of t time  it it was a while  before i could adjust myself to to that fact  you know i mean being late is something i don't like doing  really   ya and yet the japanese uh are men in particular are not noted for their punctuality   uhm to be an hour and a half late for a meeting is not unusual  well   i can't image that for a business oriented culture   i know   how can you do that to your clients or something  like that   ya   i don't know   i was quite surprised uhm   i thought that they would be much more uh conscious of  uh protocol   ya ya   being on time you know   ya   but that's uh   to me it's rude to be late   right   you know that cos then you're assuming that the other person's time is valueless   that's exactly right  and uh i i know that's the way i feel if somebody's late for an appointment with me  i i find uh i get really annoyed  and uh i would like to just leave and say well if my time   isn't valuable enough to you then you know i'm  not interested   right   ya that's that's  the exact same way i feel   ya   but uh ya and it's uhm that's a culture that's quite different too because uhm it's very male dominated  and uhm most husbands uhm uh find that it's uh seem to to feel that it's a necessity to leave from work and go to a club or whatever and then come home  later  mhh hmm   like sometimes much later laugh   and and so the wife is waiting with dinner  you know and it's ah two or three words    weren't a lot of these practices started   after after world war two  like they introduced a lot of these modern american business practices and so people were encouraged to   bond with their workmates and do those exercises in the  morning and everything and  uh   that could be   ya   ya that could be ya   ya   which is a shame really because i think a lot of the traditional japanese uh values are really interesting and uh  cough   i like them because they're family values  mhh   mhh hmm  and i think that's why i'm so drawn to them  uhm the family unit is an important thing to them and it always had been to me so i think that's why i i  feel very very close to the kids that i've gotten to know   along there   mhh   how many have you had   ohh i've lost count but probably about fifteen or sixteen  wow  ya  not enough different countries through  uhm we've had uhh norwegian uh swedish japanese  french-canadian  that's a different country right laugh   ya   that's a different culture   that that was that was an experience  it was great because it was our first experience and uh i uhm i felt like i was learning something about my own basic roots because my mom ah and dad were french  right   my father ca came   his family originated in france   hmm   and uhm in fact he still his relatives still  are there  he has ah uhm nephews and nieces and  and on down who have the la pete champagne uhm  company  awright alright   and uh we have pictures of the of the   building and my sisters have been through it when they went over and met the cousins and stuff  mhh hmm   and that was kind of nice  uh so it when noelle came it was uh like learning a little bit about your background and that was that was really neat  which i've never had the opportunity to do  uhm as a kid we spoke french only until i started school and then in when you  went into the eng english schools and the kids would laugh at ya you so you wouldn't speak french  anymore you know  right   right   and uh   was this in the catholic system   word   yes   ya  ya  and so we were encouraged to try to  con keep it up at school  cough   right  and so with my father having passed away my mom was  on her own raising us so that made it a bit difficult to insist on it when everybody else is speaking  english in the family except herself  right   oh ya for sure   so uhm but now of course i'm sorry that we ever let it go  it's too bad  ya i think mom wishes she spoke more japanese too  and wishes that we had learned my sister  and i but  mhh hmm   mhh   so have you ever taken a trip over there  uh once when i was fifteen years old i went with uh dad  and i you arrive at what is it   nari narita airport   narita  mhh hmm  and uh got off the airplane and thought there's a lot of japanese people around here  it really strikes ya right   i bet it does  you've never experienced it before and  it's it's quite a shock  ya   did you feel minor like you were a minority when you were   well uh physically i wasn't  obviously   no but verbally  but verbally i couldn't communicate with them at all  i had this long t uh teenagers  in the late seventies early eighties had long   uh longer   hair right  oh yes   hair   so i i stood out that way   and apparently i was wearing messy canadian clothes that were unironed and everything  and so people like i my cousins were telling me that i was kind of  a sore thumb that way too   laugh   laugh   but it was interesting  ya i found it was  i uh i didn't like eating rice three times a day  my dad loved it  but i i couldn't i couldn't  be bothered  ya   ya   and the bread that they had over there at the time was really atrocious  oh is that right  ya   we didn't have any store bought bread  uhm the families we stayed with had bread machines  oh really   so of course they made their own  ya   that's what you woke up to  the fragrance of home baked bread   well things have changed since i went there laugh way back when   ya laugh   so you're you have family there  ya i've got uhm dad's younger brother   and and two younger sisters are there   and the younger sister has kids so  oh ya  two of my cousins have come to study in canada  to study english  and uh they were pretty funny  they you know they were typical japanese young people wearing these t-shirts with these really nonsensical english words  laugh   yes   and and you know you'd ask them what does that mean you know  laugh   and they'd say it doesn't mean anything  we just like having english on our clothes okay  so get off our case   laugh   and some of the things that are on there are just really off the wall laugh   cough   oh dear  but they like it  ya ya   wha whatever   it says it doesn't matter  it doesn't matter at all  we were in uh hiroshima i think it was and there were some white guys  i assume they were americans  mhh hmm   so i went up and chatted with them and  after a couple minutes one guy said jeez you speak pretty good english   and i said thanks laugh   laugh   it's pretty funny  ya i i would've liked to have uh gone down to hiroshima but i we just didn't have the time  we spent some time in kyoto and uhm  awright alright   well that's a city to go to  ya it's a beautiful city  and uh we uh decided one morning we were going to walk and see a few things  and we walked and walked and walked and uh finally we found uh uh a spot that we really wanted to one of the things that we wanted to see and uh it was uhm a  a type of department store but uhm  for tourists in that they had englsih speaking uh  clerks as well  awright alright   and uh so when we came out of there bernie said uh we're gonna going to have to take a taxi back to the hotel  i am so tired   laugh   so we got the taxi and within minutes we were back at the hotel 
Canada	 and so then we started looking on the map and we had gone in a big circle  oh really laugh   we were almost back to our hotel  if we had walked the opposite way we would have come to this store laugh bef  before   poor bernie   he was just dragging his butt  laugh oh no   he was so tired laugh   well i can relate to bernie   i've got i've got a few friends who like nothing more than walking for like f f   forty hours a day you know  oh ya  and uh  it's not your bag  no  well me and the television converter have a very strong personal relationship so   laugh oh dear   bernie walks about four kilometers a day now but he didn't used to  uhm at that time he uh he  spends a lot of of time in the vertical position with the the channel changer in his hand too  well if you're in the vertical position you still don't have it right  you have to be lying down on the couch  that's the way to do it  mhh   no i try and and make sure that he isn't  horizontal because if he is i know he's going to be there for  hours laugh   laugh   laugh   no he likes uh rodeos and uh rodeos and uh sports and uh rodeos laugh   laugh   we were in calgary at the same time as the calgary stampede a couple of years ago and we didn didn't   we avoided all of the all of the  stuff  i kinda kind of wish we'd gone to see something but   my family had flown out for a vacation and they brought my  my little sister along   mhh hmm   and it was her first time in b c british columbia   and they picked me up in nelson  well i i joined and we went on the island possibly vancouver island and drove around  went to calgary so my sister could fly back to ontario  and we're staying in this nice hotel  the sheraton or something   mhh   this was when my parents were bit better off you know  go to go to eat in the restaurant there at the sheraton hotel there's a the  ma&icircumflex;t ma&icircumflex;tre d's got a cowboy hat and one of those silly little tie things  word   tie  you know string tie   you know a huge honking belt buckle  and he was leading us to the table he  he taps this plastic cow head which goes moooo  laugh   and they serve us the biggest juiciest steak ever  isn't it huge  ya  uhh   it was it was too much  i couldn't eat it   ya   i don't think anybody could eat a sixteen ounce steak  i mean that is massive   far more than any one person needs  ya  ya actually the stampede is interesting but uh when you've spent forty years going to rodeos and watching em  them   like he gets the video rodeo tape once a month and uh he watches em them   ya   a video rodeo tape laugh   of all the rodeos on the north america continent   laugh i'm certain of it   i've never heard of such a thing  ya   but he he i suppose because he's   he was involved in rodeos as a young man   he he's uh he's looking more for the technical aspects of of the rides and stuff  okay   and so he's far more into it than i am  for me it's watching a rodeo a   after watching so many it's like watching grass grow  so not very interesting laugh   laugh   well it depends on the kind of grass you know   ya   different grasses grow different   well he always gives me a bad time you see cos i i used to have a ceramics studio and i taught people how to do ceramics  awright alright   and so he he'd say well we go to ceramics shows and we you know we go to ceramic dealers where you get your greenware and things like that and i put up with that  ya at least things move at a rodeo  come on  well ya but you know laugh at least you can use some talent or some abilities  with laugh   laugh   laugh oh boo boo bad attitude mina     laugh uh dear  so we finally came to ah a mutual agreement  that he would go to his rodeos and i would go to the ceramic stores  you know laugh   and never the twain shall meet   not if he can help it laugh   laugh   and actually not if i can help it either laugh   i'd just as soon not go to the rodeos sneeze   well if you and rachelle go to the fabric stores tonight you'll or this afternoon you'll  have to excuse me i i have some pressing business to attend to   you you you you feel the  same way as he does about them eh   ya ya the t v's gotta got to  be looked at or something  it's been neglected right now   laugh   ya we'll we'll go and look at some fabric stores  that's for sure  ya  you know it's great you know it  rachelle makes wonderful clothing  she sews and everything  knits  what's it called  sews that's it   mhh hmm  ya   see i don't even know the terminology  laugh   but to get me interested in it it'd  like i'd love to learn  i wish i wish i could  did you never take it in school  no  uh uh ours was the last year where boys had to take shop and girls had to take home ec economics and uh   oh but they didn't switch   there was no mix  oh ya   that was the last year  see cos now of course they switch over   uh i think the girls in grade eight take six weeks of  shop and then six weeks of sewing and six weeks of  commercial uhm like uhm computer - related studies   and  so they get a a a little bit of everything to be able to see what they wanna want to  get into  and uh my granddaughter got into the woodworking part of it  she really got off on that and uhm  and she  actually she's won a scholarship to uhm uh the college in edmonton and uhm she'll go there next septem   september   not this september next september  and uhm start uh her courses  in the meantime she's uh uh been offered an apprenticeship ah ah  program and so she'll work for the company f  for before she goes to school and then she'll go and take some of her training and back and forth  wow   so she's looking forward to that  selkirk college at nelson has a really good fine-woodworking program  oh do they   she she she  probably won't be interested since she's since she's   already going somewhere else  but they've got a a one year program  ohh   and the stuff that the students come out with that they show at the end of the year it's it's beautiful  it's incredible isn't it  it's incredible   ya   she made uhm a rocking horse that is just  oh it looks like satin  it is gorgeous  and she's even got eyelashes on it and a mane made with uh rope and  oh it is just the most beautiful thing  every youngster would love to have it  hmm  and uhm they had it on display at the gallery and the lady there said they could have sold it ten times over  easily  and with no problem at all  and of course ashley said no she was keeping that  for her first k kid or for her children   i don't blame her because it's the sort of thing you might never ever make again you know  right   and uh but the grains of the wood and everything are just aww  and she just ha did it in such a way that it flows like  muscle you know  hmm   so like the the back legs  they the flow of the the  grain of the wood  i don't know what kind of wood she's made it out of but uh it is beautiful  so i said well you could let me have it if you want laugh   i remember taking shop the last time in grade eight and i don't know i think my last project was a table or something   you know it was still sticking together a few years later so   oh was it   oh that's more than mine did   but it wa wasn't   it wasn't it wasn't the most beautiful table ever created on the face of the planet that's for sure  laugh first time they let me work on the lathe i think i cough   i started off with ah a nice spindle a nice piece of wood but uh i think it was lots of toothpicks when i was through  laugh   i just could not master that thing at all  not at all   i'm not mechanically inclined laugh   neither am i   should work on something though  gotta got to do something with all this testosterone you know  oh ya i see laugh   words ya  it's a male thing  you wouldn't understand   have you ever heard of male answer syndrome   male answer syndrome is when men even when they know nothing about a subject will go off and spout off on the subject for hours on end whether they really know anything at at all or not  i didn't know that's what it was called but  six or so words   it also includes it also includes men going in the wrong direction forever without stopping to ask directions  that's maybe three words   oh ya don't ask at the gas station    whatever you do  ya   no no   i wouldn't do that   that's not macho   rachelle rachelle  rachelle has to do that  i won't do that   laugh   that's a typical thing with guys is that they won't do that  male answer syndrome  ya   that was in an article  it uh that's the label that this writer gave it    a woman writer of course when she wrote an article about it  laugh   ya well that uh i think uh that's something that i've noticed with guys though  they they never ask directions  they'd sooner get lost than ask directions   laugh   i have gotten lost laugh   so do you have any hobbies at all   cough mhh hobbies  besides the t v i mean  what more is there than the t v i don't know  i uhm i uh  this past year what have i done   not much  i like walking a bit   rachelle and i have tried to set a policy of going for a walk every evening  mhhm   it hasn't worked  it hasn't worked oh laugh   no   i like watching t v  i like reading   when i was a kid i did judo   wasn't very good at it though   it was okay when i got older and i could pick on the little kids you know but laugh   ya boy laugh ya boy   but then i'd have to stick around for the adult class too cos dad was a teacher  so then i'd have to words   oh your dad taught   ya  but now he he curls and he   and he's bought himself a nice big television and a nice big v c r   he curls up laugh   he doesn't lie down either though  no  just like your husband he sits down  ya   that's another thing with guys  they flick   flick the t v cos they can't make up their mind what they  wanna want to watch  well there's so many things to watch though   ya so they watch a bit of this and a  bit bat bit that of that and get nothing out of either one   mhh mhh but you get an impression  and and and and it's the  impression that's important  ya   oh i see  i i wondered about that cos uh i've noticed that women will flick through all the channels and then go back to the one that they've decided on  within a couple of minutes they know what they  gonna going to watch   laugh   but men it's up and down and back and forth  and then they start watching one thing and just when you're getting interested they flip it to something else   laugh 
Canada	" but matt 's got that figured out  he's got a solution to that  he's got a huge screen t v with a little inset so you can watch two at the same time  right   that sounds like heaven laugh   ya ya   matt why do you do that  doesn't that confuse you  no more than your reading five books at a time he says  laugh   good point good point   ralph teases me because i i   read several books at once  uh but ya you haveta  have to have a book in the bathroom you know and uh you you need one you know just in your purse in case you're on a bus or you know you're traveling someplace so you  mhh hmm   i don't use a purse laugh   ya but you you know your pocket or whatever  and uh when i was going to school i used to have one in the front room and one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom of course  cos you read at night  and uh then one with my school books and then one in my desk so that you know when i was supposed to be reading doing my latin or whatever and it was boring i'd have the book stuck in between   word so  right   but everybody else teases me and says well how can you keep track of that many books at once   i don't know i just do  or uh like i can read the first page of a book and know if i have ever in my life read that book  really  ya  it's it's strange  uhm as soon as i i read the first page oh ya i remember this book  i you know it was about   and i and i can tell you   you know part of the outline of the story  i wish i had a memory like that  but it's only in in that sort of thing  i my memory like laugh short term memory where i put my pills down sometimes laugh is  or did i take them laugh   ya   oh no no no you've never had that problem no never no   no  but when it comes to stories that i've read uh that's different again  i i can uh   and it doesn't matter whether it's just a harlequin romance type thing or if it's  i've never read one of those  oh they not "" they're"" good light reading  but   i i can't bring myself to  well there's a lot that you skip over but i find that the interesting part is that they're set in different parts of the world  mhh  and so you learn different things about other countries  so you you can skip over the garbage parts you know  i was sitting in a lounge and and and   somehow the topic of harlequin romances came up and then two of the women said oh they're always the same they both agreed  and somehow they they started constructing your basic plot for every harlequin romance   oh ya   and they were both coming up with exactly what the other person was thinking of  apparently they had both read the same one coincidently  but  ya ya   ya no that's true  they are basically have a basic plot and they just uh work around it it seems  but they they make for easy light reading and so you know when you want a break from anything uh a little heavier well they make alright they're alright   they're not my favourite reading but  that's what comic books are for  come on  ya well see now i never did get into comic books  although uhm we we do use them in the school system uh oddly enough uh for youngsters who don't uhm like to read  oh i can believe it   it's a good way of getting them going you know  ya i can believe it   the vocabulary there is pretty high tech though  i remember in grade seven i used my comic books for my weekly  vocabulary lists  mhh hmm   and the words were like you know three or four syllables long and uh  quite complex  mhh hmm   ya   ya they are good and uhm i think we've found that uh archie is one of the better ones  cough   ehm  for what age group  uh grade five grade six  ya ya  because at that age boys in particular don't really want to uhm  uhm sh show either show that they like to read or uhm they don't really like to read  and so uh in order to get them interested that's one way  allow them to read the comic books  that's what i'm a bit worried about teaching english as a second language  how do i get kids who don't like reading in their first language interested in reading in in in their second   hmm   get the comic books  ya they really are good for them  uhm surprisingly because  and they're not violent  in in the archie comic books in particular are non-violent   right right   and uhm right now you know back to the fifties type attitude is sort of in and and you know the kids are into the  right   they don't seem to mind that  uhm and they can make fun of it and it's non-threatening to them  so it it they feel a little more comfortable with it  awright alright   uhm i think uh ya i think that would be a a good way   i think if i was learning another language that's the way i  i would uhm probably uh   but something that's funny  things that are funny stick in your mind you know  languages   i haven't had much with any any of the indian languages  everytime i was in a completely different area where they use a completely different alphabet much le less   and and the word  was totally different  mhh   when you go to the language camps how do they uh how do they start you off learning a language  well for me there wasn't any  it was just like you f find   you know you find out you're going to this state in india and they usually speak this language so you scrounge around looking for language tapes and   you know you find these great little books that say learn gujarati in thirty days or laugh something like that   ya right   learn japanese in an hour ya  mhh hmm   o one   of them one of the books that i came across was  really good  it had a a little section on visiting the doctor  and uh one of the things the doctor says is open your mouth do your bowels move freely   laugh you know useful useful  combination sentences like that   laugh oh god   so i learnt how to say that  i've forgotten some of the stuff   did you ever use it   no i never had to   laugh   my bowels moved a bit too freely for a while there  laugh   ya ya  the uh uh what do they call it  somebody's revenge or  laugh   oh montezuma's revenge   montezum 's zuma 's rezem  revenge   but in in india it's called delhi belly laugh   laugh   ya i suppose there's a name for it in just about every country isn't there  laugh   i i've i never really uh thought much about it but i wonder if it when the kids came here if they had the same problem  i'm sure they did  well i know they did  one of uh one of my participants   had a had a health problem  this is the one with the single mother host family  and the single mom said okay well you know want me to meet you at the hospital cos i have to go to work right now but i can meet you at the hospital  and the girl said no no no  and so the host-mother took it at face value  the girl said she could take care of herself  fine   what this girl was expecting was her host-mother to insist upon coming and and spending twenty-four hours twenty-five hours a day with  her and mothering her and you know taking care of her every whim  and need   arghh   laugh   ya   and uh that wasn't happening  it wasn't happening   laugh oh dear   cos you know the this her   host-mother was a self-made independent woman and she's got you know a lot of stuff happening and and   if a person says no she'll say okay no and she'll go and you know do something else  mhh hmm   ya  what i found was sometime i'd ask the kids if they wanted something and they'd say no and uh then uh a little while later i w realized they were waiting expectantly and i'd think  they didn't understand what i said  word   it finally clued in to me that they had no idea what i'd asked them  laugh   they just said yes or no depending on how the moment struck  them i suppose laugh   laugh   so you had uh you know you have to be a little careful there   ya   uh because uh i noticed that quite often uh uh  and so pretty soon you get to realize it's the hesitant way they say the word yes or no uh that tells you they haven't a clue what you're asking them  ah ah and it depends with which ones  like a couple of the indians spoke better english than any of the anglophone canadians in the group  like like hew   one fella fellow was the president of his college debating society back home and  he could see through every nuance that you put to every sentence  laugh   ohh   so if you were trying to say  well one of the canadians made a faux pas and kind of did a half-hearted apology for it and the guy saw right through it  he said that's not a real apology he said   and uh it was ah it was a disaster   that that particular session  oh wow   they're uhm when the kids come from india   they're really uh some of them are into college already aren't they or university   they they're all they're all   they're all at the college level ya   ya   ya  but they finish   high school goes up to grade ten or something like that so college is like senior high school  oh   oh i didn't realize that  ya  oh i see  here i was thinking my god these guys must be extremely bright  to be in college already  maybe four words   ya   cos they were nine  eighteen nineteen and they had were into their second or third year  ya   well they'll they'll  finish off their b as at the age of twenty  wow   like they'll get their master's degree at the age of twenty or  whatever   ya   now is that equivalent to our ah bachelor's degree here do you think   i'm not so sure  i don't think so either   i don't think so but don't quote me on that  no but i i just i i can't see it  i mean you can only stuff so much information into eh a person's head over a certain period of time  i know   but unless they're uh a genius uhm i can't you know  and the educational system is based i think on the old old british style where the teacher gives all the information and the students learn that information   mhh hmm   and there's no real no really  th no real thinking going on about it  like a sponge   mhh hmm   but uh it's quite bizarre  ya   i have a a young friend who is in uh  china   i thnk she's gonna going to make her home there eventually  it's been about a year and a half since she's been home on a visit and then she went back  and uh uhm she's teaching english to unversity students   in in china  she says she loves it there  awright alright   and uh she was the type that uhm in school  she could the teacher would be talking or they'd read out the text and she'd just was like a sponge  just seemed to absorb it  wow  it was incredible to watch "
Canada	" and her she had a brother that was really bright too  he's uh now a sheep farmer  laugh   he went to university and got his all his   degrees and then decided no not for him and  lives over in gambier island there i think  oh really   but like gambier or tuxedo or  one of the islands anyway  and uh raises sheep  two words very laid back  maybe four words   good for him  > but uh she decided that sylvie  decided that </}she was uh going to take languages and uh she specialized in uh mandarin  and uh speaks it fluently  ohh  ya  she is really an incredible girl  she tried getting married and living here for a while but uhm  didn't quite work out   no she wasn't happy with that  uhh her ex-husband uh was transferred over to a small community on vancouver island  so she decided no that wasn't for her  and uhm so then uh they split up and she had the opportunity of going to ah china   mhh   uhm a year's uhm contract  so she went over and just enjoyed it so much   that she signed on for uhm a  a word length of time  ya   mhh   for ever laugh   ya i was talkin talking to her dad just recently and he said no he said uh i don't think she'll ever move back home  she really loves it there   so i don't know what it's gonna going to   be like when it uh all comes under communist rule but   but she's not in in hong kong  she's in mainland china so  is it is it part of hong  like there's part of hong kong on the mainland called kowloon  but that's that's they speak cantonese  oh that may be   no  it's mandarin  mandarin ya   ya okay   i don't know  ya  i never thought to ask him  he he did say the name of the  the uh community she was living in but uh i wouldn't  ever be able to remember it laugh   you gotta have got to work on   chinese sometime laugh   ya right ya   uhh   ya   usually if it if it's  a japanese uh area i can i try and remember those areas  uh especially if i've looked it up on the map but uhm uh  china is uhm that's another kettle of fish altogether laugh   where else did you go in japan  well we uhm we stayed at ome  which is just north of uh tokyo  okay  and uhm then uh we spent some time in uh uh shinyokohama  which is uh uhm uhm part of some   part of yokohama   part yokohama ya   okay okay   and then went from there uhm we were in uhm kyoto for three days   and uh we were at uh uh uhh just between kyoto and yokohama at uhm   can't recall the name of the the  community  but they h have uhm  huge strawberry houses there  strawberry houses  strawberry houses in japan are different  they don't  like here when you know the strawberries ah  fiel field ah farmer you have huge  fields of strawberries right   right right right   but because of the uhm uh the landscape in japan you've got agriculture areas all down each side but the spine of japan is all mountainous right  right  and so they had to in order to have some uh agricultural area they have to utilize the  mountainous area/[>  right   and so what they've done is all up the hillside they've terraced up  right   and on each of these terraces they have like a dome shape uhh structure that probably is oh maybe half a block long and it's uh made with uhh wire uhm s uhh supports  and then like a plastic over top of it  okay   so that you could s uh sort  of semi stand up in these little houses  and uh within the house they have   it's almost like the cement abutments we have here  and they're they're four high  okay  and where these cement abutmen  abutments   you know how it'll go along flat and then it has a dip in it  mhh hmm  well this goes along flat for a short distance maybe six or eight inches and then there's a dip  and within that dip is where the soil is and the strawberry plants are there  and so they hang out from the cement   right   well the sun heats through that plastic  onto the cement  i see   the cement causes another excess   heat and so they ripen quite quickly  and their season goes from january to end of tape   by the way when uh when i was in uh rosthern ernie who in is interested in  history teaches  history took me to batoche  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh  have you been there  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   did you did you  see the the audio-visual presentation  word   ya  isn't it fantastic  well i saw most of it  something wasn't working with it but it was still very good  oh dear  oh dear   ya  and uh of course it was a gorgeous day  two words in june  ya ya   and they had a drought at that part of  the province whereas in calgary it was pouring  rain   ya ya   ya   but uhm i i really enjoy just walking along the north saskachewan river  and i want to canoe that  from edmonton to saskatoon some time   push push   ron ronald   and madeline took us took us   there     cough   mhh hmm  angelo and ian as you know  word we word   word younger   they were very impressed  and a couple a year or so ago  angelo did a school project ah an essay  on riel  and in fact wrote pages about the actual battle which was very  vivid in his mind from from the this show  ohh   ya   and he wasn't he was   sorta sort of shy about this so he  he put his you know his his  book sources down but he didn't actually say i was at batoche and saw this show  mhh hmm   and so the teacher was sort of taken aback by this  not "" these"" pages of description of the battle and felt probably that  angelo had lifted them from fiction  whereas angelo was remembering laugh you know   ya ya   we also have a couple of good sources  you know we bou we bought like  one of the brochures with battle plans and   stuff like that   mhh hmm   so he had he had  all of that   i want to go back cos we didn't have the time that day to really walk the whole battleground  you know we we saw the   the museum the presentation and made it to the church and the old house  ya   the old word   but uh we didn't have anymore time  see what was really neat was that uhm uh cindy was gone for the day and so uh ern   ernie and i ended up sitting up till about one o'clock at night talking about well exactly the conversation we had before talking about those books  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and then the morning we went out to batoche  the amazing thing about is rosthern is  mhh hmm   we got out of the car and left and said aren't you  gonna going to at least close the door  and he says oh no it's hot today  laugh ya ya   nobody locks the door   laugh   we know about it   i know isn't it wonderful  have you've forgotten but how did how  how did you grow up   but that's what small town life was like for us   oh well we never had locks on the door at all  okay well we did have locks and my parents did lock up at night but we always left the keys in the car and so did everybody  ya   and you know why you that you   leave the keys in the car for the same reason   that was in case your neighbours suddenly needed to  borrow the car  and we did on at least one occasion look out and see our car backing out the driveway in a hurry  laugh   and it was our next door neighbours heading off to hospital  take taking somebody to the hospital in a hurry  they had four children  wow  so that was the reason for the keys in the car  ya  that i think might've been exceptional though jan   well but just to leave the keys in the car that  was standard  ya   well i remember earl mentioning when we came to guelph and i kinda kind of left i didn't lock the doors and and he commented about that  he said you know you're you're  in guelph here and uh    lock your laugh   word here word  in light of it   ya   ya   well we have we we  have to tell  laugh   they have taken to they leave their   apartment door open all the time because uh dan hasn't been able to sort of make it to the right buttons to let people in  ya   and so if he's there by by  himself  so a great deal of the time they leave the apartment door open  it's been a problem of of   a do doctor their doctor being able to get in     mhh hmm     mhh hmm   this is this is  difficult   they have the telephone they're talking on the telephone and the door buzzer works through the telephone   and and and so   oh i see   but uh and he also they hid   a key on the roof of their building  and mom and i went and looked and couldn't find the key  well i'm not terribly keen on the thought that now somebody has a  you know one of   one of their keys   mhh   ya cough   did it have a a a number on it  no but all you have to do is go through the building and try every door with the key   well guess who else is uh   knows about not having keys  three o'clock this morning i couldn't get into the house  laugh this is the other side of it laugh    oi-shh   cos i had given the key out to uh  to friends to to take care of the cat   the cats   oh ya   mhh hmm  cough   and uh so i came back ah from   from the office and i just thought oh i wa  gotta have got to get in there and get to bed  cough   couldn't get in  tristam sleeps down in his room downstairs   i banged on the basement basement doors  everything  couldn't rouse him  i i knew i couldn't anyway   so i went around to the other complex which is where uh these friends live  and i i'd given the key to helen  i knew that her son is usually up till late hours  and sure enough the light was on   rang the doorbell a couple times   and she comes down with her son   who who's trying to get us  at three in the morning  at three in the morning   laugh you know  given that she had been stalked last year   gee laugh i mean did i feel silly  but it was that or go back and sleep in the office  laugh mhh hmm   i don't know when i've done that at three in the morning  oh well   so  word i remember being locked out of of earl and mariana  's house   stupid adventures   in the middle of the night i arrived from a bus in toronto  ya  took a taxi and they hadn't we hadn't  really communicated about how to get into the house   so and i couldn't rise not "" rouse"" them  anybody  so i i threw a a   snowball up on the window of their student   you know this was in the house on mayfield  mhh hmm   ya  the student the student  eventually opened the window and said what are you laugh   yells   laugh   laugh   it's okay  it's just old me laugh   can you let me in please laugh   laugh   ya  well you know be because   of of living in  i i lived just in the condo just next to where you were  ya ya   and uh there's so many people around there that i didn't want to yell and scream and kind of   oh sure   when i got in i said to tristam nice guy you know uh "
Canada	" it uh says something or other on the bottom on this  i can't make out what it says but it's either bohemian or czechoslovakian or something i dunno  don't know   oh   yeah something cut  hand cut  hand cut lead glass  laugh lead   uh oh yes it is  yeah   yeah  if you don't want it i'd like to keep them   oh really  yeah  hand cut  oh yes well sure you can have it if you want  i think jan didn't want it  mm but   no  yeah  actually uh there are three things here this this and this if you don't want them uh i'd like to keep them  oh yes okay sure   mm mm   i always liked this actually laugh   yeah yah it's different you know   i quite like that  ah i can remember being kind of fascinated with that as a child but  rooster eggcup oh  laugh okay   mm hmm   yeah it's an unusual eggcup in that it holds a large egg  oh  well this holds an even larger egg  well that's true   you realize that this is an eggcup  yes i know  that's the way it's held   oh ho  right  okay  i woulda would of used  that one   okay anyway you don't recognize these glasses  no  okay i'm going to keep them then puffs   i don't think i recognize them anyway   well you should have some vague familiarity i mean    i mean you would have run into them at some point in the cupboard possibly  well   well no i'm not used to running into that  cupboard  mm i see  yeah  okay any this uh use for that  no   no  or this  no   mm fifty cents  fifty cents yes   okay what about that wood dish  no  monkey pot holder   yeah undoubtedly  yes  the woods of hawaii honolulu's finest of waikiki   monty monkey pot monkey-pot is an american tree   now i dunno don't know if this was something that she picked up yeah it was probably something she picked up on her first trip  she either picked it up or people used to come back from hawaii with that kind of thing all the time  she had several   yeah i know right   yeah yeah   we dumped some of them before   yeah there's sigh word   oh my  i'd forgotten completely about these little  uhm   those probably are rather valuable  yes they are  uhm are we gonna going to get rid of them word   no i think i probably shouldn't just get rid of them  no   wilton   wilton fine china  no these these uhm should be retained  no   these are genuine antiques  yes   i think i'm not sure but i think that these were hers when she was a girl  ehm probably  no no these   probably   yeah i should at least uhm uhm  two or three words   you can put it over here   mh okay  hurry it up   mm  are you gonna going to keep the sugar tongs  no  i don't need these  no   nor do i  laugh   i don't suppose ever anyone  uses sugar tongs anymore cos no one uses cubes of sugar  no in fact i haven't seen sugar cubes for some time   draws in breath hm   okay  yeah oh yeah   oh yeah so what did uh the rest of the  pivo   oh yeah uh   uhhh how do you turn that off  over at the wall   oh uh   yeah it says i guess you just push on it yes   uhm hmnah stop tape cut off   yes okay no uhm i don't think i'll have any more  pivo   actually i'll leave you with the bottle   all i want back is the empty bottle  mm hmm  so uhm  yeah ah uh i think that thomas and i will probably go to a different place to uh make our next batch  oh  yeah the uh er   do you want these glasses   no   ten cents each  we we have a couple of those  word   do you  yeah  well if you ha you   have a couple of these why don't you take them   mm yah yeah yeah might as well to uhm  complete the set yeah   yah mm   then you'll have four  yeah  they're juice glasses  yes two words   actually joshua rather liked it uhm  ah i guess he still likes it   uh because we well it was a nice size for word yeah   oh yes yeah   uhm  okay  joshua went out for his uh first football  word football first soccer game in uh we  well ever in organized soccer yeasterday  uhm and his team won  mm hmm  i was really surprised and impressed  mm hmm  he uhm he gets in there and  plays  mm hmm  and he knows what to do  oh  ahm and   how long did how long does  that go on  uhm oh it's interesting  it goes on until the twenty- seventh pronounced twentyyyyy-ssssssseventh i think of june and then there's a month's hiatus and it c re word   uhm the th uhm third of august or something like that  oh how often is it  it's once a week  oh   that's it   mm  well anthony was doing an assignment yesterday too   of of   he he had to talk or he had to do something artistic about the creative person  and last week they had to write ah some sort of a  a short essay about this creative person   and this week they had to do something artistic that represented the activities of the creative person  mm hmm  well what anthony did was uh wrote about his uh grandmother  not maeve   mm hmm  about   his nanny  who uh various times has written poetry  uh has done stained glass painting uh drawing and uhm also taught ballet  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  she was also a bell telephone operator at one point  mm  uhm that was when she was doing uh learning ballet and also taking her classes  but uhm uh he er his conception  was to show ah in some ways the way in which she progressed through some of the phases of her her own work  mm hmm  and uh put it together in a kind of a collage  was actually really good in in   showing the uhm doing a kind of an  in ini in a way an imitation of her work  mm  and uh tape cuts out   word hear munching and stuff  speakers are eating as they speak for the whole conversation   no i think it's okay  uhm yeah in terms of the fish aquarium actually uhm  did you turn it on  yes it's on  oh   uhm let me think  i put it in in november  we came we moved in in november and i cleaned it for the first time in april  no  ya  so like i emptied all the water out wiped it out rinsed off the uhm the uh gravel and uhm and then replenished the water  okay   it's off at the moment because uhm we didn't wanna want to have the background noise  uhm and uh  okay   so it's off and the light's off as well  but it's it's pretty maintenance-free really when you consider  and i and i don't expect to have to clean this as often cos i only have one fish in there now  and when i had the two   did one die  yes one passed away  thelma passed away  it was a very sad event in my life  ah  laugh   she was smaller and i think she uh she   just here's here's a fork   uh   i found one  okay    they gave me one they didn't tell me  she was smaller and uhm i guess she just  she probably wasn't uh wasn't  well when i got her  cos i was always having to take her out of there and put her in sick bay  i had a little bowl at the side and i'd take some water and scoop it in and put her in and she'd seem to get better and i'd put her back in the aquarium and she'd get sick again  so she spent more time in sick bay than she did in the  bowl in the ah aquarium so  it's funny how even goldfish tend take  take on little personalities because i had some fish i don't think they were goldfish they were orange i forget  what they uh what they were called  oh yeah yeah   they were tropical  mm hmm  they were quite similar to goldfish and  there was one little guy  mm hmm   and he used to whizz around that tank  he we he he was really really tiny  yeah  and and i used to call him whizzer   and i was really i really grow not "" grew""  fond of that silly little fish  yes  and he passed away like it was awwww  laugh   but when you think about it laugh   yeah i was just a little devastated when the little one went cos i i kept because i had kept nursing her  you know it was harder i mean if i'd just come in and found her dead i think it would have been easier to deal with but  that's right   but you did all you could and then she still passed on  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  it's too bad   but uhm he has quite a personality cos i when i was cleaning the aquarium i had to put him in the little bowl and he was very upset with the fact that he was in this little bowl  and he must be quite uhm uh er sensitive to noise because whenever i would walk in or if there was a flash of light he would zip around the bowl about five or six times frantically  mm hmm  uhm and i i never see him do that in there  so i guess uh he was showing his displeasure at the fact that he was in this uh little bowl  but it's we don't have water here so it's very awkward in terms of like you know notice if the  there's been a lot of water that has been depleted from the aquarium just through ordinary uhm evaporation  and you're getting that's good cos you're getting natural evaporation of the water  it it's it is good for me yes and uhm  but i ha i find it  sigh awkward to find time two or three words   this sounds funny it only takes a coupla couple of  minutes to go and get some water and yet you're always so busy   and you're in your day that i mean how many times do you go to fill up water or or for the kettle or for the coffee whatever and yet can't find enough time to find water for the poor little fish   that's right   i have a poor plant that's not "" that"" you know  gets neglected  mm  my spider plant is going to be in dire straits if i don't water him tonight  and soak him  i'm jus i just noticed the trunk of that tree  mm   is that done on purpose  mm hmm  it is  mm hmm  two words   so you buy it like that  i got that at the greenhouse over in the hall  building from french name   mm hmm mmm   mm hmm  we bought could be 'buy' - speaker is eating  all our plants there   and um they're all doing well  the only one i didn't get from french name  is the bonsai which is now dead  uhm that was from sophia   it was a gift from her  mm hmm  when i left the office upstairs cos i helped her  so she sent me a bonsai  and i told her at the time i said i feel so guilty owning a bonsai cos i know it's going to die  what do you mean   and it did very well for a long time  but why would you say that  mm they need a lot of attention  yeah i gave one to my mother  i don't think it lasted very long   so your parents were married in thirty-nine   i think so  i don't know  it's funny with a lot of these things you take them for granted and you don't actually remember them   ya you don't always remember ya   i i was an adult before i figured out that my father was forty-three when i was born  ya ya  not not young ya  well when you're the youngest  how old was your dad when julia was born  that's true  ya   you know   ya cos i he was twenty-eight when i was born but julianne is uh nine years younger     mhh hmm "
Canada	 how's life laugh   well so far actually pretty good  ya   you know i've been keeping busy  how are your courses going   not too bad actually   cos you're taking that learning disabilities   right   yes ya  and i'm i quite like it actually  ya you think it's gonna  going to be okay  so far  well so far it's been uh pretty easy  well the first week we missed the class  ya   because the class was on tuesday and the school didn't start till wednesday  uh huh   remember   mhh hmm   well we had no class that week  ya ya ya   then the next week uhm we had a class the next two weeks  uh huh   and last tuesday i had no school because it was a jewish holiday so the teacher didn't come  right right   and tonight i have a class but it's a jewish holiday also  mhh hmm   but so he's not going to be there but he is sending a replacement  you're kidding  wow   so it's good  there's no term paper  gee  gonna going to be  two word two tests   just two tests and that's it   fifty percent mid-term  fifty percent wh   which i i i like that  you know   that's not too bad   i don't mind   you just do the reading   you go to the classes  you learn the material   it's easier   ya   i mean even though everybody at the bissel  centre's gonna going to hear me say this   but uh   ya ya   no i agree because sometimes you get so overloaded with projects  ya and if you've  i it's just   like right now i've got all of these group projects and it's so hard to get people together and you don't know the people that well and you get thrown into these groups and you're just running all around like a  mad person   that's right   sometimes you wonder what you're learning  ya exactly   you know are you really learning more  if you do all those things  then then not  right   mhh hmm   ya   so sometimes i thi   think i really think it's true  it's too much  right   it's almost like busy-work  well that's it  that's it  you know and once it becomes  there's a fine line between busy-work and  learning   ya   and crazy - work  ya right  and learning something   you know when you're just going nuts   ya  and there's a real reason for it  anyways so i like that   ya ya good   and the other course i'm taking is an adult   which one's that aga  again   a adult ed   adult ed   mhh  we have a paper for that one  okay  so i  but not due yet  ahh   and a presentation  oh ya  so we can do it in a group  we're doing it in a group of three   a group presentation  okay   which i for me i  prefer it because there just seems  to   mhh hmm   ya   well i found that group presentations aren't too  bad  if you don't have to do a write-up to go with it  word i've never done a presentation    i've never done a presentation   cos if you do a write-up it's it's  really hard you  know to like get everybody to do an equal amount  of work   then's it's a word   right   that's true   and then you know you have to you know group edit it  you're right   you have to do uh make all these meetings and ya  no absolutely   so that's not too bad   but i've never done a presentation   would you believe it  oh come on  really  you do them every well the other  day when you're teaching   ya i know   no that's right   but   i know that's why they send you to   but not formally   but not really  i'm not sure how to you know go about doing it  or what i'm  supposed to do  do it   ya   you know they just say do a presentation and  and never say on what   ya   ya i'm sure you'll do fine   because three words with teaching experience   words what i'll find   i'm not worried about doing it it's just what i should do it on you know  no   no i know   on what  but the people with teaching experience are more natural  when they do it  because people who don't have this experience  of getting up and speaking in front of  people what they do is they read their presentation  yes   i know   oh really  they have it on little cards and they read it   ahh   and it's it's not that good  uhm well not only for your mark but also it doesn't flow and   it it's hard to listen to as a listener in the audience  you know if it's being read to you   mhh hmm   mhh  or even if it's memorized too  much or   right   oh boy it's hard to memorize a  presentation that's a half an hour  long   you know it's it's hard to follow   well exactly exactly  so but mind you you  well i suppose you're right  i think you have to memorize like certain parts but   not word for word   because when you're teaching it's not the   it's not the same because i  i don't you know  it's much more natural  no   mhh   well that's it   but anyway i'll   that's what i have to do  ya   so <-i've it's real really  i haven't been bogged down with projects and  things yet  and i'm quite happy  ya   i'll tell you the truth   good   we've been going to the country every weekend  ohh wonderful   the leaves are beautiful   oh i bet  so i feel like i have a life  ohh great   laugh words    ya that's what i'm looking forward to after this year is getting a life back again laugh   you'll be finished after this year   well i should be finished in april   if everything goes well   ohh   because i've got my two practicums and then uhm  i've just got two other courses   you words after christmas   no i'm doing one now  are you  now   ya   are you in a process of doing it now  ya   ya ya ya   you're actually doing it  well no no  uh well actually i'm teaching the tyndale students now  beginners' class  and this is to prepare us for going into the primary school  for teaching beginners  like children huh  okay  but we get the adults now because they're so much easier to teach than little kids  ya   ya  and uhm so we're practising with them  and uh i'm   how are you feeling  how are you finding   well it's interesting  again we're doing group teaching  so this has been kind of difficult   okay group teaching meaning you do some and then they do some or toge together you do it  you can't teach together  we do a little bit  uhm you know the there is like one person in charge of each part more or less  ya   but then uh we get like the other people in our groups uh to interact with the students in like the group work or the pair work and that's what it  word   mhh hmm   right but generally how you do it usually is one gives a presentation perhaps and one might do  no  you word   uhhm   you can't both give the presentation   well for example you  you introduce   something and then maybe i'll get one of the stu student like one of the student teachers to come and do the dialogue  with me for example   the introduction to the lesson no   right   okay okay right   and then maybe i'll take half the class and  you know get them to follow me and then the other class will follow the other person  for example   right   it has its good points and its bad points i guess  you think   well ya   the thing is we got put into groups with people that we hardly knew  okay  so that it takes a little while till you get used to the other person's personality and and what we found was we were haggling over a bunch of insignificant  details   right   right right  you know trying to decide you know the exact word that you want to put in you know at every little model sentence that you're going to give  and and you know it it  can take like ten twenty minutes sometimes  one person wants to say it this way and the other person want to say it this way  like somebody wants to say how are you and somebody else wants to say how are you doing   and then this gets argued about for you know fifteen or twenty minutes   right  that's and you think a it's waste   of time   it's ridiculous you know  ya   that is  it is  so these are the kinds of things that   how often do you have to go  uhm well i've done uh two sessions  and i've got two more to do  so i'm in a group of four people and we have to divide up eighty-five minutes between the four of us  and we also have to follow this kind of pattern they have  probably you've heard about this  the pre-activities the while-activities and the post-activities  ya  and then we've hardly had any time like to meet and  organize this  stuff   okay   ya ya   so what i'm finding is with our group is  that one person does something for twenty minutes and then the next person does something and it doesn't fit at all with the thing that came  before it   right right right   you know there's no continuity  so it seems like we're we're giving   all lessons all over the place   is it happening in every group   or do you get to observe any other groups do it   well the thing is we were the first group so i think we were a little bit you know  uh penalized in a way   right   what is who's your teacher    we didn't have time to prepare   who's uh who's the teacher    uh his name is charles batard   he's a principal of an elementary school that does these intensive english courses   oh okay   or actually in intensive   e english programs  you know these kids that go for six months or something and they do only english   mhh hmm   and uh he has his own little school in st st  eustache  and that's wh where   actually where i'm hoping to do my practicum because i've heard that it's supposed to be really an excellent excellent school   mhh really  that particular school  ya  and the c t's are supposed to be very very uh  not only very very nice but also very very helpful and knowledgeable and they have lots of resources  and i know somebody who did the practicum there last year  and she was   can you ask to go there  i did already and i'm waiting to find out now  if if it will happen  phrase have hmm   because you know they have to look at everybody's situation where everybody lives and you know divide people out  so i'm hoping that i'll go there  it's far  it's far i don don't   i know but i don't mind if i get a good   three words right   i don't blame you  if i get a good spot i i don't care if it takes me two hours to get there  mhh hmm   i'll do it   and then when do you start uh to go  that'll be in november  the whole month of november   ya okay   every day  mhh hmm  ya  so uhm ya that's what i'm looking forward to that   i'm really looking forward to it because i think uh of   if especially if i get that position or something comparable  you'll be doing primary  is that right   primary ya   mhh hmm   i think it'll be a really good t   training program   oh ya   i think you learn  there's no question you learn more from that than you learn from all the you know courses you take on early english history of language and  sounds and phonetics and  right   laugh ya   you know it's good to know but  well exactly  ya  you certainly learn by doing  oh that's for sure  and what i really want to do is learn techniques 
Canada	 mhh hmm  practical things  ya  i've had hi history   you know theory up to here   that's true that's true   you know and history and all this  kind of  stuff   i know   no go in if you go into a classroom you'll   i mean it's interesting but i mean i want to learn the the stuff that i can use and i feel that that's one thing that we really haven't gotten enough of  that's true  so uhm i guess that's what we'll find out  and if i'm with these teachers who know a lot of  techniques well then  i'll learn a great  deal about these kinds of things and can use it later  ya mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   ya  and you know a lot of times you hear about these techniques but if you don't see them or experience them or do them  you you you   no you have to do them   ya it's like being a dental hygienist  ya exactly   you could go to school for ever and a day  that's right   you can't you can't   be a dental hygienist until you actually clean somebody else's teeth   for heaven's sake you know  that's right   ya and for a few years too  that's right   and then you know how to do it properly  that's right   ya   so there's no question  that experience is the best teacher  oh ya   that's for sure  but you know it's like they say they won't   har hire you unless you have experience and you can't get experience unless somebody hires you  ya   so it's that's a problem  ya   well actually this girl who did her practicum at that school  in st eustache she was hired   one of the girls in your class  that made   no last year  okay  she graduated and uhm we exchanged phone numbers and uhm i called her up just because i was panicking about my first teaching thing   because i got thrown in there so quick  and i didn't  know what i was supposed to do  oh ya   ya   ya it's scary   and we didn't really have much information   ya i don't know what   we were just told okay do it you know  and i didn't even know what a pre-activity was or a   word   they didn't tell you any of   no no no no no   that's really strange   i know   didn't you have methods methodology  ya but we hadn't gotten to that part yet  we were just talking about what makes a good teacher  wha now you're doing methodology   laugh ya now  oh that's so silly  it's / - > ya it should have been right at the beginning  or it should have been before your practice teaching  before the teaching   right  but it wasn't  ya see something like that   we're just getting into that now and i've already taught twice  ya  so uhm no we were getting into other things like uhm  you know characteristics of a good teacher and how to make groups  and you know all these different things which are certainly practical but uh  didn't prepare us for our first  teaching   experience   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   hmm   mhh hmm   so uhm  so she was hired at that school  ya  so she got a job  not at that school  wow   okay  at a different school but with an intensive e s l program  how did she get the job  well she thinks it was because she did her practicum there  at that other school that had an intensive program  mhh hmm   so she got hired by this different school  did she apply to the school board   or something  i think so   i think so   like when you say you're gonna  going to finish in april  ya ya ya ya ya ya ya   that's great  so are you gonna going to  apply   i assume you'll apply for a job as a  teacher in in all the  proper places or something  right   ya ya ya   see what happens   i hope so laugh   no i was just cutri  curious yes you know  ya   ya so i'll start putting my name in  ya   but i i don't know  i i might be starting a master's program too   okay   but then i wouldn't mind teaching part- time  and doing a master's program too  uh huh   mhh hmm  that's actually what i'm hoping to do  what would you do your master's in  uhm that's what i'm thinking about right now  but uhm i'm thinking about either linguistics or education  mhh hmm  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  because i think uh education could be a good field to get into because i think we are getting into uhm educational reform in this country and  you think so  you think you know it seems to be less demand for teachers   than there was   less demand for teachers but i think we need different schools or a different kind of a system  well we need a different type of a system but will we get  you know what i'm saying   no no but look what's happening to the hospitals  ya  i think  so it's gonna going to    you know does it pay to be a nurse  or whatever because they're closing up the hospitals whether they  need to or not  we uh   i i don't know like   mhh hmm   right  but i think more and more parents are wanting to  uh find something better for their kids  are demanding   mhh hmm  and i think that the dropout rate also is becoming uh a real problem for society and i think  other alternatives have to be  mhh hmm   well there's no question   i'm i'm not saying that everything's going to be totally changed but maybe there has to be uhm other alternatives added to what we already have   and uh maybe uh more of a reform in the  mind rather than anything else about how to approach learners and uh schools   word   mhh hmm   sounds good  sounds good  sounds good   sounds good   well i hope so  anyway listen   it is   once you're taking all those courses and to  you know hopefully one gets a job you know  well ya  that's it too  sometimes i wonder   but then michael and i we could be sent to indonesia or something you know and then you know   really   ya   because   he will he will be  transferred   it's it's a possibility because his company does do a lot of work overseas and well i'm interested in traveling somewhere too  ya sure   for sure   and uhm so   well then you could always teach there  well that's right  so it's two words   but i'd rather have a master's because it opens up a lot more possibilities and   i word i see  sure that's  and it's great for you if you you know can travel anywhere then   you could always you could do  this anywhere  ya   ya   that's right  ya  that's that's pretty  good  ya   ya  so i mean i i don't know for sure  mhh hmm   these are just the directions that my mind  is going into   uhm but i think i wanna want to  start a master's program uhm cos i just feel like ya if i'm traveling too it will open a lot more uh  possibilities   i think so   ya   especially today  ya yup  so many people have master's now   mhh hmm   it's as common as a bachelor's was  not that long ago  uhh   i know   that's right  even a p h d has become quite the thing  right  most of you know  bang in background whoops  a lot of the professors are here or whatever that have  a p h d  mhh   oh ya   a master's is just nothing   ya   right  ordinary  ya ya   i know  well i have this one teacher he's got four master's and two p h ds  wow  teaching english lit here  i just about died   and they don't think   it's silly almost you know   well yes yes  but what are you going to do with all those degrees anyway  ya   i don't know  teach first year english you know laugh   i have a friend who only has a high school diploma  ya  he's making more money than all those p h ds put together   oh i bet  what does he do   he's he buys and sells   stuff  ahh   hmm  and he's just growing by leaps and bounds daily and he's  not 'he' just doesn't know what to do with all his money  gee   he's making money hand over fist  he has a high school education  ya it's amazing  and it seems that more and more people are so over-educated there aren't any jobs for doctors lawyers and p h ds  well that's right   mhh hmm  unless you wanna want to  teach english lit   that's right   ya ya  anyway so   no that's true  that's very true  wha wha but what  kinds of things does he buy and sell  he buys and sells close-outs  you know if a company's company is   going out of business he'll buy all the the  stuff  oh ya   you know wise brothers went out of business  oh ya ya ya ya   i don't know if you remember   ya   so he bought all the inventory and he'll sell it to dollar stores or various other stores  mhh hmm   right  and he'll buy uhh you know different stuff that people can't sell  mhh hmm   he'll he looks around for close-outs  it's it's quite the   the big business   ahh booming business huh   wow you have no idea  he uh just started a few years ago and he's   doesn't know what to do with all his money  exhale   gee   wow  ya literally  really really   ya well we certainly need more people like that too you know laugh   ya an entre  entrepreneur to be an entrepreneur now that's the only way to make money  certainly can't make money by working by the hour  no  no matter i always say no matter  how much even if i get a raise in my job another few dollars an hour even if i make laugh you know there's only a certain amount of hours in a day  mhh hmm   ya that can work   you you can only make a certain amount of money   mhh hmm  so that's not the answer  you know if you wanna want to   make money  no   no no  you know i guess that depends what you want  but it is nice to make money if you're working   well it helps doesn't it   ya you know especially if you go to school  until you're  thirty years old like i am  i mean it makes life easier   well exactly   ya laugh thirty  forty laugh   shhh  ya not too loud   i let them think that i'm thirty   oh i know   okay  there you go  but no i know what you mean  i i was thinking about that too  i mean i've been going to school and doing a lot of different kinds of things with my life  so ya you don't have that much time to start you know saving up some money and uh you know working on your pension plan and all that kind of thing  ya   ya  which is also part of life eh  you have to think about those things too  in in uh like in our adult education course i was thinking of we i was  speaking to this other girl that i'm doing it with  i said she said maybe we should do our presentation on the changing trends in adult education  mhh hmm   uh huh   so i said ya and then i said maybe  we should we could say that many well not that many years ago adults didn't go back to school to change careers  mhh hmm   you just didn't go back to school when you were forty  and decide you're going to become a dentist  that's right   that's right   mhh hmm  like it was unheard of and unacceptable  ya  right  that's right  and now people even the universities   wouldn't accept you  if you applied to mcgill montreal university at forty years old and say you know i want to enter the school of medicine they'd laugh you out of ah uh out of the place 
Canada	 ya  whereas now it's much more acceptable for people to change  careers at anytime  oh ya   go to school at anytime of life  people don't look at you like you're   you're nuts  right   ya but some jobs are becoming obsolete too  people don't have a choice huh  exactly   that's probably for sure  and then a lot of women are you know going back after they have their kids  oh ya and changing word  that's right   ya  whereas before they didn't really have the opportunity  that's right  and it it's really it is more or less the opportunity and being becoming more acceptable  right right   yup  so it's a different changing world   ya  and people are getting older too  that's true  living longer   and living longer  and they're not   wanting to do more things huh  exactly  it used to be sixty-five years old and you sat in your rocking chair  that's right laugh   or at least that's what we thought they did anyway  ya ya   and now oh my gosh they just s  start living  exactly   they travel  i mean my mother is seventy-six years old   and she is the tour leader   of the seniors   two words   mhh hmm   is that right   oh you're kidding   you're kidding   i'm not  she leads them on trips  really   ya  she takes trips  she takes them to florida in the winter  oh i should maybe find out about that because maybe my mom could go   if your mom is doing that kind of thing  because my mom she needs to meet some people  like older people to go traveling with  to definitely not 'you' mean to go on the trip or be on   but she she isn't here   to go on a trip   your mother isn't here  she could   no but i'd bring her here laugh you know if i knew of something like that  i'm sure she'd have a ball   it is the most fabulous fabulous  thing that you could  mhh hmm   it's fabulous  they go they have the greatest trips  the day trips  two day trips a week   ya   trips everywhere  they've all  and my mother has gone to terrific places  right   she was during in in  the summer she's gone to saratoga or something for a day or two  great   uh huh  they go to plays  the pigory   right  oh okay okay  i'm trying to think of  but do they go for like a week or two weeks or something like that   yes they go for a week   they go to washington  oh they go for a month to florida  ya   really  you have a choice a month two months   or  three months to florida  because something like that would be excellent for my mom    ya   you have they have  different options   ohh okay   they go to arizona   for a month   right   really   okay  oh well i should get some information from you about that  two words ohh it's  your mom must have a lot of brochures and things  it's   ya   uh huh  or  and upcoming trips that you're word    upcoming trips   i could tell you all the upcoming trips  ya  it's really  that would make like a good christmas present or something like that you know  but she'd have to come here  ya she'd have to come here  to go with this particular group  that's okay   she could come here   i'm sure they have seniors' groups  where she is  ya i know but s she     but she wouldn't go unless you gave her the ticket  that's right  you know and i i really think you know  she she wouldn't do it on her own  right  she needs to have somebody organize it for her  mhh hmm  and i think if i organized it for her then she would probably do it  thats right  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  you know she's not really much of a person for doing it on  her own   mhh hmm mhh hmm  you know she she has no experience at doing that kind of stuff right  mhh hmm   so uhm   that's great because well the trip is all   organized and you go with all you know  types of people and   gee   you know  ya you meet different people and   you meet different people  they take you to show  that's right   i mean it's all   ya my mom needs to have something that's organized  so that you know she doesn't become confused or you know she can just  go and have a good time   and and they look after you and  so   right   absolutely   and they look after you   my mother's the one who looks after the seniors  that's right   my mother's the   phrase   ya ya ya   but see this would be a great role model for my mom you know laugh   oh you should see her   i told her i wanna want to grow up to be just like her  i bet   gee  she sounds great  mhh hmm  wow  so she ya   actually she's doing something at concordia montreal university now  really  ya  they came  i can't remember where they came to  maybe the one of her golden ager things  ya  see at this place the golden ager thing where they have  this trip they have other things too  uh huh   okay  they have bridge lessons and  besides trips  this is just one section  mhh hmm   they have bridge lessons and art lessons and  mhh hmm   all kinds of   you name it   you name it  mhh hmm   you can go everyday and participate in some kind of ah an activity and meet people  it is  talking a about   you know we were talking about seniors sitting  home in their rocking chair  right   mhh hmm   right right  i mean it's phenomenal  ya   anyway they tr at concordia  they tr they were some people were trying to organize ah  some sort of a conference on how to get seniors to volunteer  mhh hmm   oh okay  so my mother   mhh hmm   they asked her if she'd like to participate  two words laugh   so she volunteered   to be on this committee and to figure out to  discuss   ya   right   it's like a think tank  ya  gee  so she goes once a week here  and they plan  they decide what they should do  who they should send the brochures to  should they get or the radio programs  uh huh   you know how should they reach the seniors   right   how should they get the seniors to know  that's right   if like your mother if you were to tell your mother you know if you wanted you could come once a week and help in the cafeteria  maybe she could do that   that's right   she could serve the soup or  something   that's right   right right  would you like to volunteer and and   serve you know   mhh hmm   people do that  right right  and that makes you come every day  it's more challenge word meet  people  that's right that's right   maybe you'll sit down after and have coffee with somebody that you   that's right  ya  so how do you figure out  how do you get the seniors to find out about what they can volunteer in and  right right  my mother's amazing  she goes bowling once a week  she plays bridge once a week  she plays cards one night a week  sh   plus she goes to this golden ager the tour and travel that she works at this   ya   well i'm interested in this tour and travel because i would really like my mom to go on a nice trip and meet people you know like older people around her  own age and do things with them and you know do things with them and you know be kind of looked after  phrase   right ?  because she's she's  not used to it  mhh hmm   she uh   they really are looked after  ya  cos i took her to hawaii with me once uh  with michael and i  we went together  wow  but for her i don't think it was that much fun  no  because it was like we were babysitting her kind of thing  that's right   no she would rather be people with people    she would rather be with i think a   a big group of people and be able to talk to a lots of   people and have some fun and dance and  i don't know play uh  cards or you know whatever they do  absolutely   of course   ya   mhh hmm  but with us it was kind of like  and and she even told me she  kinda kind of felt like she was a third wheel  you know me  absolutely   i i don't blame her  you know   and it's and it's it's it's  normal  it's it's word    even though we we  did what we what we could to make her feel  good   i know but   you know we went out for dinner and  little tours and stuff you know but   it isn't even anybody's fault  you should be with your own friends  ya  i don't wanna want to go with my  mother even though my mother's terrific  ya   i don't want her her i don't want to go with her   ya   i don't want her to come with me  right  let her go with her friends and i go with my friends  right   and that's the way it's supposed to be  exactly   as a matter of fact i have a friend who brings her mother everywhere with her  oh no laugh   so there you go you know   ya   we don't like  like the people we go out for supper six   coup couples   three couples or whatever and she   her mother comes  all the time  no   mhh   really   and all everyone says you know rolling the eyes and   two words no she's bringing her mother  oh ya   and then i tell myself like why does it bother me  uh huh   i i we have discussed this with  myself   uh huh   oh i see  okay  right  right  when you think about it logically why  why does it bother me  i don't care if she brings her mother really when you think about it   really ya   why should i care  mhh hmm  but you know what people don't li   like the other couples don't like it  the other couples don't like it either  no no   it's not just you  it isn't just me  nobody likes it  no   and i know  i've discussed it with some of the others  they don't even know why they don't like it  why   you know you don't mind if you bring your mother once  ya sometimes or once in a while   and she's word nice   or whatever  ya   i i can't still can't put it i can't verbalize what it is that bothers me  they word you have to be with your own friends   ya  she's nice   well i think there's something in that  you know that you know you you   and i don't want her with us  ya  i i don't wanna  want to talk to her  maybe that's another thing  i wanna want to talk to my friends so  she'll sit if she sits beside i end up having to talk to her and i don't really have that much in common with her  maybe that's   maybe you don't know her really  i do  you know your friends  i do know her   oh you do  oh okay   she comes with us all the time  oh laugh okay  but i don't but   but maybe she's not your choice of a friend  that's it  exactly  hmm ya maybe   that must be it   ya  but it's interesting  so even you know you talk about you try to  make her f you know your mother feel comfortable and  here her daughter tries to make her part of the group part  right   ya   she's not part of the group  no no  no because when we went to  hawaii you know i i  felt ya she didn't feel   that comfortable   i have   it's   i'm going to have my   my supper   oh ya go ahead   ya go ahead  no  but she didn't feel that comfortable   no   and then you know my husband you know he kind of said well you know next time we're not going to laugh take your mother 
Canada	 you know it w was   it's just not the same   i don't blame him   i think it was very nice of him to take her in the first place  oh ya i think so too   freddy wouldn't want to take my mother  no no  well i mean we had never done ths before and i thought well you know we could try and see what it would be like   well yes you tried   you know and why why  couldn't   i brought you a cookie   oh thank you  and you think why can't everybody enjoy themselves but somehow you know the good dynamic is not  there somehow   it it doesn't   that that must be it   somehow   it doesn't work  oh by the way talking about going  guess where i'm going this weekend  where  you'll never guess so i'll have to tell you  ya  reno  you're kidding  wow  with with freddy   the two of you   his brother his brother's  son my nephew  is getting married  uh huh   ya   now he moved to san fransisco  he went to law school in san fransisco  uh huh   you know he couldn't get into any other law school except that one  is that right  mhh hmm  wow it pretty nice law school  san fransisco's a gorgeous city huh   ya   hmm  but nevertheless that's why he ended up in san fransisco  right  and he met this girl and a year ago  they decided to get married  mhh hmm   in reno  well her parents  she's from reno  oh she's from reno   you know i guess   from reno  i guess they were there  isn't that amazing  so freddy said i think we should go to the wedding  i said what  are you nuts  we're going for the weekend  it's gonna going to to cost us a  fortune  mhh   i said i don't think it's laugh such a good idea   but he says he only had one brother  mhh hmm  da da da da da  think   oh well why not   so if you wanna want to  give me a dollar to put in the slot machine for you  everyone says will you word   now's the time   but   put my name on it  but  right  laugh   but don't give it to me cos i'll   i already lost a dollar today  i bet with freddy this morning that o j simpson would be found guilty   i haven't heard yet  he's innocent  they found him innocent   they they acquitted him   they acquitted him  and freddy said no he's gonna going to  be innocent  i said no way  i bet a dollar  i already lost a dollar  uh laugh   uh huh  he's innocent  so he's being let go then  absolutely  i didn't hear the radio conversation references taping, 5 seconds   i didn't hear the radio but when i was at school   someone came into my classroom guess what innocent on both counts or whatever  mhh hmm   whatever that means  i don't know what the counts were   well i guess because he he  supposedly killed two people   mhh   wow  you know a lot of people thought he was innocent  that's what i kept hearing  i was surprised   my my friends thought he was guilty  but my students i was speaking to them today   thought i don't think he's they don't think he's guilty   ya   mhh hmm   and i had one student said i mean maybe   maybe he's a little guilty  how could you be a little guilty  ya   well he made a mistake  i said it's not a mistake   what kind of mistake   people just don't s they don't get it  no   they don't get it  they think he's less guilty because ah of who he is  mhh hmm   i think that's a kind of a mentality thing  ya because he's a big s star   hero and star and  boggles the mind  but i was thinking that he was guilty because   of uh   you know of things that he was doing before  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  the things they said  > that he had been abusive and he'd been stalking his  ex-wife afterwards and  mhh hmm   i think he's guilty   well that that  made me feel that he was guilty  yup  and then also the way he reacted when the police chased him  remember when he  was in his bronco  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i mean if if he wasn't guilty why would he be taking off like that  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and it seemed like there was blood everywhere   mhh hmm   even at his house   you know it's like   word cough   and and if he didn't kill her then who did  ya and what's the motive  what's the motive  i mean it's amazing  mhh hmm   it's just like uhm there was this article in time magazine not that long ago and saying how anybody who is not rich and  famous you know they would be locked up like nothing  famous   mhh hmm   ages ago  and the money   you know that's really what determines whether you're going to be found guilty or innocent and it just proves it   ya and this is a definite case that just proves it   just proves it  mhh hmm   wow  hmm  isn't that something  ya  and that i had a   stu student another student  that we were talking about it today who said you know they read all these books all these trashy books  and she said that uhm i didn't know about it nicole simpson or whatever   was had a friend who was into drugs and uhm them it's the mafia that probably killed her   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i never heard of that  so they got it all figured out  huh  and and goldman just happened to be there  oh ya  there's a new tactic for you  well that's ya  well  i don't know  neither  meanwhile i think that 's terrible  oh it is  mhh  it's amazing  hmm  he's going to be laughing all the way to the bank  ya i with this  this book that he brought out  did he  i didn't know word   yes there's a book he wrote while he's  been in prison  wow   well there you go  it's called something like i want to tell you  oh really  uh huh  i was waiting for something to come out  maybe three words   and i heard something else on t v the other day  what was it   that he has all of this stuff just ready uh to sell  uh for after his acquittal  mhh hmm   really  ya you know like t-shirts and you know all sorts of little knick-knacky kinda kind of things that people will buy and collect and  even though it cost him all this money for the lawyers i mean  mhh hmm   well he'll make it all back again   interviews on t v afterwards  uh for sure   mhh hmm  well it doesn't pay to be good  laugh   there you go laugh   there you go there you go   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  mhh i don't know  so what else is new mary   what else are have you been doing  what else is new  let's see   but it keeps you pretty busy doing all this  school stuff eh   uhm   well ya school has been really really busy  i haven't been doing much else out  i find   actually i'm hoping that this weekend   will will be a free weekend just to do  something different   ya i heard   in between projects and stuff   ya  no i find when you have a words  sometimes you take many more courses than i do   ya  you know so if it's not one course that has something it's another  right  and they give you so many things that  i find it really takes up all of your time  mhh hmm >  > oh it does   definitely   uhm ya   but this this year  i i don't know  uhm i'm finding it it's so different than last year  mhh hmm  like last year it was just so much in in   in the way of uhm individual work  you know lots of studying lots of papers and individual  projects   okay   ya   but now it's just sort of changed  it's all of this group stuff  and i i i like working in groups if you don't have to  meet  ya  if you don't have to be meeting so much and you know uhm  mhh hmm   if you have to do a group report i find that really difficult because uhm  i don't know why they they   i mean it's it's a good idea   ya   you know it's got its point but it really is hard to organize everyone   but it's not like the  that that you have a uhm computer desk  somewhere on the university where you can all  you know cram in there and you know  work on it or you know something like this  mhh hmm mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh   i mean everybody has to take their stuff home  type up their stuff  bring it back  mhh  and then you know you have to sit there and haggle it out  i see  which takes a lot of time because people don't agree  you know   it's a waste of time   mhh hmm   one person wants to do it this way  one person wants to do it that way   so this i find really quite difficult   the uhm  i wonder what you learn from that  you know you're supposed to  that's   ya i think they want us to learn how to collaborate and negotiate things  i hope that's what they'd like you to learn  but i'm i'm finding you know   it's i don't know it's just so rushed  you know you have like about a week to prepare something  together in a group  mhh hmm   i mean you can't possibly do   most of the time you're worrying about the logistics  that's right  that's right  which is a waste of time  ya  ya  i mean you can't all the time just spend working on the thing  that's right  have you heard anything about that computer head  course we're taking next term  no no   i'm just curious   but i'm looking forward to it  i hope that it will be something really practical without group work laugh   i don't know what  i hope it  no i don't i have no idea what it's about   ya   but uh no i haven't heard anything about it  no  but oh i know what i should tell you  we went to uhm one of these vineyards out in the eastern townships a few weeks ago  ahh   really   and that's actually what i would like to do again this weekend  i'd like to go out there  especially if it's nice  uhm this vineyard it's called uhm le cep d'argent  and they make uhm different kinds of not only wine  but  also uhm   mhh hmm   cough   uh what do you call them like ah aparro  nonsense word   uh what do you call uh  a cider  no  uhm you know like a cinzano or port or something  what's that  you know like when you have a drink before dinner  aperitif  aperitif ya  and uhm also champagne  cough   and uhm   so they give you a tour  they give you a tour   and so just like they give you in   in california and france   that's right   i didn't know that they had a w   winery a winery   here   and and   ya ya ya  they have a few of them out there  and there quite new though  oh okay   uh mostly french people who have come over here  and uhh clicked with some quebec people and then started that   i either it's not very well  known or i just never heard of it  it's quite new  it's quite new  ya   must be  they're they're quite new  there're there're probably about seven of them out there and   cough   seven is a lot  they they're they've probably just  started up in about the last five or ten years you know  have another cookie   so they're quite quite new  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so we went to this one and uhm they took us out into the fields and showed us the grapes and told us you know like all about the climatic conditions and all that kind of stuff  mhh hmm 
Canada	 and how they uhm gather up the grapes   mhh hmm   and took us inside and showed us the machines and all   this stuff   mhh hmm   and actually it was quite surprising because they do quite a bit of stuff by hand there   do they   ya  and then we had a tasting you know taste-testing  mhh hmm   cos i've been to few of them  ya  california  okay okay  ya  napa valley word   oh okay  oh well then you know this  uh huh   uhh so ya we got to taste different  things   testing is the most fun  ya ya  i've been to the mumm's cham  champagne plant or whatever   oh okay   mhh hmm   and uhm so anyways we ended up buying some stuff cos it was really very very good and i'm so diappointed when i buy wine here a lot of the   times   mhh hmm   you know cos i'm not an expert you know   did you get a good price because you were at the plant  i'm just curious  or was it the same price as the liquor store  well they can't sell to the liquor stores here  because the taxes are so high that it wouldn't uhh  it it wouldn't make their product competitive with the other products  mhh hmm  so you have to buy it there   and uh their their wines  were around they're around ten dollars a bottle  cough   mhh  but they were really good  mhh hmm  i mean i just recently bought a chardonnay a french chardonnay and i paid ten dollars and it was so bad  mhh hmm   it tasted like  vinegar   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and i used it for cooking  i wasn't gonna going to drink it  it w was it was lousy  cough really  it was really really lousy  ya   and so i used it for cooking  i mean ten dollars  you know it was just like throwing it  away   ya   wow   so what we wanna want to do is stock up on some of that wine out there and bring it home so that we  we have it for when you know  we we have  people or go somewhere or  something like that  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  but it was really very good  but at this place we didn't go to the dinner but they have these special dinners there  like medieval dinner or   oh they oh ya  oh do they  yup   so they have this kind of medieval setting and the  food and all this   ya   uh huh that's fun   ya i thought that would be fun  and i think they have a mystery one too  murder mystery or something like that   mhh hmm   ya  i always wanted to go  i've been to a medieval one  oh have you   st helen's island  oh  they had one at st helens island they had one with   i don't know that one   it's very   oh best two words there   oh ya  but the murder mystery one it's quite expensive  oh is that right  i think so  their price was about i think it was thirty-five dollars  mhh hmm  and it included well your whole meal and the entertainment but you only got one drink  the murder mystery   that's not bad   you know one glass of wine  that's not bad  ya  cos i thought it would be much more than that  oh is that right  mhh hmm  but i think this is the medieval one  i don't know about the murder mystery  mhh ohh   or maybe they're all the same price  i can't remember  but thirty- five dollars   cough uh huh  that was that was the price  that uh i remember seeing  ya  hmm  but they have other ones out there too  and there's this other kind of wine which is called uhm   well in french they call it hydro-miell&eacute;   hydro wi wine  honey or i don't know  anyways it's wine made of honey  and uhm this is apparently this old greek method for making wine  the greeks made wine out of honey   mhh hmm   and so then they've started doing it out there  cough mhh  and other people have cider  mhh hmm   and you know all sorts of different things  like it seems like   was it was it  busy  it wasn't busy busy but i mean there was a group before us  maybe with about ten people  cough   and there were about ten or twelve people in our group as well   mhh hmm that many   ya   how'd you find out about it  uhm i had some brochures about it so i knew but  i had never tried to find it  before   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   so this day you know i think we drove by and we said hey there's one of those wineries  why don't we stop   well they say this past weekend was  beautiful  like this past weekend was so beautiful   mhh hmm hmm   and the weekend or not before the weekend  two weekends ago we climbed mont tremblant  mhh hmm   we went hiking up mont tremblant with a group of friends  mhh hmm   that was beautiful   oh i bet   ya it's been gorgeous   you would have loved  i should have invited you to come   mhh   i forgot   next time  cough i will   next time   ya   you would like to do that eh   ya give me a call   i'd love to   i bet  i'd love to  no but the only thing is with school and stuff you know i  i don't know if it would have been a good weekend for me  because one weekend michael went with a bunch of his friends and i couldn't go   okay  and they had a beautiful time   okay okay   it might have been that weekend   probably   probably was  because i've seen the pictures  you know they're great  oh ya   ya  but ya give me a call and you know if you guys  are are   doing something like that   uh huh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   cos i'd i'd love to go and if i don't have too much homework  mhh   ya  yup  well this weather's so nice  oh it's great  ya  i hope it stays you know for for ever  ya laugh   laugh it's true  ya  but uhm ya so i don't know about this weekend  i heard it's supposed to start raining on wednesday or something like this  i thought oh no   but i won't be here so i don't care  this tomorrow   mhh hmm   ya when do you leave  friday morning at seven o'clock in the morning  oh wow  how long does it take to get there   i don't know  we have to stop in toronto  mhh hmm   and then we fly to san fransisco  mhh hmm  and then we take a little plane in to reno  so i'm coming back on sunday  wow   isn't that crazy  mhh  so we won't be able to do much  mhh hmm  but nevertheless it'll be fun  oh ya   stil fun to go out and   i've been to san fransisco so it's not i don't  feel as though i've i'm gonna  going to be there and not tour  around   no   mhh hmm  right   i mean it would be nice to stay longer  but uh one of those things  ya   quite the jetsetter aren't i  ya that's right   ya no kidding  gee   well but it's nice that you can do that anyway  it's like freddy said if he's only got one brother i mean it's not the kind of thing that's going to happen  much huh  if he wants to go   no   so i'm  or maybe ever again you know   ya   mhh hmm  so and you know what the days just go by  and the weeks  mhh hmm   my gosh we'll soon be planning for christmas   word right  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   it's october   it's just it's scary  i can't believe it  remember last year we were in the class  it's like a whole year   mhh hmm  a whole year went by   i guess it's really scary  mhh hmm  sometimes you think oh my god  oh i know   no i think well in one month i'll be starting my practicum   can't believe it  and one of our teachers who said today well you know half of my course is finished now  mhh  and we went what  uh huh  and he said well you're going to be going into the schools in november so i'm not going to see you for that whole  month   and then you come back in december and you write your final exam  uh huh   mhh hmm   mhh  so actually his material is half finished  wow   mhh hmm  and it doesn't seem like we've done hardly anything  uh huh   are you you're planning on taking your master's in the summer   like after if you finish in april you know are you you going to start taking courses immediately  i might  mhh hmm  you know maybe two or something  why not eh   like i don't know if i'll be able to get a job  you know if i can't work in the summer i might as well be doing something  right  might as well   mhh hmm  but i don't want to do it   you know like this last summer i was a little bit busy  i had three courses  uh huh   i don't think i'd take more than two  maybe   mhh hmm   and then maybe i'd try to get a little bit of part-time work  here and there  because i'm starting to hear names of places and  from people  and things   ya   mhh hmm   and i'll probably try applying to some of these uhm  private companies  that sort of thing  and just see what happens   or may sometimes they have these intensive summer courses too  that might be a possibility as well   to take or to teach  to teach  somebody phoned me to teach  one this summer  cough   where   oh really  ya  but i couldn't do it because i was going on holidays then the last two weeks of august  mhh hmm  and i really needed the holidays cos the rest of the time  i was studying  so   i would   sure   well you really do  you really do  ya  so i said uh no laugh   no thanks laugh   mhh hmm   was it for a company  it was actually one of my teachers for uhm education  i did this uh practicum with her which was a lot of work  mhh hmm  i remember you had mentioned it   and she phoned me up and told me that she knew somebody who was looking for somebody and i just i   i didn't even talk to her  she left me the message on the answering machine and i just  phoned her back and i left her a mesh message  saying that uhm thank thank you very much for calling but i'm going to be on holidays  and you know i didn't go into it  mhh hmm   i did quite a lot of work with mel  about mel 's wedding last week when i was down   i went to see the dressmaker   did you like her  very much  i think she's very good   that's the colour of the uh bridesmaids' dresses  do you like that  it's kind of a cranberry colour  well it's a nice uh colour for christmastime isn't it  ya it is  i mean it's not my favourite colour but mel loves it  oh that's good  this is this this funny woman  she uhm she's a designer  uhh i think she designs probably more for the the  young and the slim than the middle age mothers of the bride  but   mhh hmm   i liked her stuff very much  > melanie 's dress that's she's made for mel   it it's beautiful  it really is word   she's made it already  ya  just about finished  really  and what ah ah   very very simple   no uh she doesn't want melanie doesn't want a veil on it   doesn't really go anyway  we'll do the decorating flowers   well hers is white   ya  well ivory   ya and and  this is this is for the bridesmaids   that's for the bridesmaids  and   all of them  mary and  including mary 
Canada	 ya  mary won't have a slip  she's too little  but uh she might have some cap sleeves but  the the the dresses are  pencil thin straight down with a little slit   quite a big slit as a matter of fact  uhm and mel 's dress is almost exactly the same only it's white and it has ah kind of a thing on the shoulders to make it look like a bride  so how may bridesmaids is she gonna going to  have   seven   my gosh  isn't that awful  i know  vulgar almost  oh my god   but uhm   and are the boys all ushers  yup   well that's gonna going to be really a family affair  mhh hmm  and uh   did you go to the church  i've been to the church  ya  mhh hmm  and i went back to the club and looked at that again  and i i think i might get this woman to make me a dress too   e even though i'm not young and slim  well i'm slim now since i lost all this weight so   since the surgery  but uhm she had some quite interesting things there  now the day we did the dressmaker was the day that mary-alice  plank had taken us to lunch so she came  along as well with lots to say about a lot of things as  mary-alice   always does   mhh hmm   no doubt   but uhm i think that's fun  she's incidently in turkey now on a cruise  oh  tough eh  not with the not with the man that she was supposed to go last time that she two words    no no no she's trying to get her money back from  that fiasco  an escort or something  mhh mhh mhh mhh  laugh she didn't do that  uhm okay now i just wanted to talk to you about uhm the florist  i went to see her  she was recommended by the westmount florist  up there  ya   it's called fiore and it's on st clair between bathurst and christie ah and she's certainly a designer as well  i like very much her her ideas and  thoughts  now she'd like to do   you mean designer of of  arrangements   of floral things   floral arrangements ya  ya decor  okay  ambience  anyway so for the church we'll have uh two big candelabra at the front uh decorated with uh bows and greenery christmas greenery and berries and uhm ivory coloured roses  mhh hmm   i think it'll be just gorgeous  mhh hmm  and we'll have the the pew uhm markers with green and greenery and uh these red  this colour almost uhh brocade bows  mhh hmm  everything costs by unit  then in the at the club there's this  you know there'll be an artist well just like the one here  well you've been there enough  uh they have the big room with kind of goldy uh walls and we thought we'd put these red brocade tablecloths with gold trim and gold candelabras on each one  cos you know how mel loves candlelight   mhh hmm mhh hmm  decorated with uh the same theme as the uh church thing  but it's gonna going to be a  a word   i figured that the flowers are going to be   that that that was what you said was gonna going to be our   our share of the   ya we're doing we're doing   the flowers and the dress  flowers   mel 's dress my dress and scott 's  but that's   and then a few other things of course  but basically that's it  mhh hmm  uhm she's looking at probably they're going to ask ohh two hundred i think and they expect they'll get about a hundred and sixty  guests  mhh hmm  ya  well it includes c uh family   ya  which is quite a lot of em them   you suppose tim is gonna going to  make it to that one  no tim has given up on the family  this was his last gasp according to uh what brian said  really  mhh hm  did mina get brian by the way  did she say she got him  yes she said she did  good i'm glad  ya   that's good  i'm glad   ya   uhm so i had a couple questions i wanted to ask her  to do one the white uhm runner thing at the church   down the aisle   yup   you always get crinkles and exhale   but anyway that's fine   she wants that  that's fine  it's only a hundred bucks  to rent it  to rent it laugh   ya right  everything's rented  boy they make a killing on that  i don't know what the flowers are but like  but i got the prices for all the stuff   now i showed mary uh i've shown her uhm a pattern for her dress and   is is she  gonna going to have her dress made down in  she's gonna going to  have be   no this woman's gonna going to   do em them all   and mary doesn't have to go in for a fitting or anything  we have to get the measurements  and i've given her mina 's  so everybody has word   huh  so c sh can she do like minor adjustments uhh when we go down there before the wedding  itself   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   she's very much on deck  now the catch with the florist is that the decorations in the church uh er is some of them are going to have to be moved to the uhm reception and we'll have to get trucks or boys or somebody to help us  with some of those things   mhh hmm   i've seen people do that   they do it in just station wagons if they have them or  ya ya   well ryan has a van  so we could use that one   ya that's right  he does   and uhm who else has a van  don't know  maybe get the stevens to bring their van and we could borrow that one  trade with   i'm i'm sure brian wouldn't mind doing that  i think he'd be quite pleased to do something useful  don't you   he's quite good  i'll i'll ask him  they're definitely coming  they're arranged to come   uhm but no i think it's gonna going to   be lovely  and that's gonna going to be  the the colours  this colour and ivory and and gold  and green  that's good   it's great for that time of year  but lots and lots and lots of candles   in the church and in the in the p and r  mhh hmm  and uh no i think it's gonna going to  be really very pretty and very melanie   ya not overdone  mhh hmm   mhhh   laugh   ahh ah it's well it's new year's eve after all  ya right   it's it's not laugh  it's not going to be vulgar  i will not let it be vulgar  i promise  ya her mother would be into that if it were  uh i don't think it will be  it will be really really nice  uhm i'm not going to go for the gold uh napkins  we can use white ones  mhh hmm  because the club provides them  they're probably four dollars and kind of   each to rent or something  i forget that   and i'm not going to go for the chairs she wanted   but i think we'll use the uh the  tablecloths   what do you mean chairs  the   oh she'd rent you gold chairs to go with her whole thing   oh my gosh   no i know  it's what a what a   racket huh  something for a girl who was gonna going to  elope isn't it  it well some so ya right   that'll be the day  now the club will also be decorated  it'll have fires on so we have to do the fireplaces  it's gonna going to be lovely  we have time  ya   the nice thing thing is we have some time to do it before  you mean going down there before again  i i mean you're going to have to go down there   i'm going to have to go down twice more   and then christmas  ya   i think  from what i can see   now i'm planning to go that week and i wondered if you would be interested in coming  that week in october when the baby's due  which is when  the baby's due on the twenty-first   i uh won't have my maybe three words  cough   it's it well we have to be back for the referendum obviously   well that's for sure  uh and we want to be back for the massey 's do  so maybe we can come back on the saturday or the friday night  uh uh i'd have to be here for sunday anyway   yes for sure  well i know that  but we phrase   ya well that sounds alright  i d don't i don't think i i don't have anything on that uh  week i don't think  well you could just check and see   ya i will   i mean my book's up  uhh i haven't got my book here  now the invitations are going out i'll have to check with mel but i think this week  and and i'll  really   oh ya  isn't that awfully early  no  not at not being at christmastime and people having to plan  i don't think  certainly the out of town ones oughta ought to  go   that's what we could do is do the out of town ones first  but i'm not allowed to address any of the envelopes  she's gotta got to do it herself  i'm not allowed cos they'll never get them   oh the writing huh   laugh right  ya i'll bet   they're / - > they're all teasing  peg said she'd do some and whatever  mhh hmm   but if we get the out of town ones done that would be good i think   so people can plan ahead  now mhh i think what we oughta ought to   do is   we're going to be staying with at  ron 's house  they're going to barbados from word   ronnie jones   no ron and ron  and annie cobb   oh   oh  we have their flat if we want it  oh really  okay  okay  until the twenty whatever day thirtieth   then i think we oughta ought to get a suite in a hotel and have mel with us and mina and  mary the last the night before the wedding  okay  well we   ya and then the girls can all come there and get dressed in there and uh get their hairs not 'hair' done there  and w and whatever in the morning  well we better book that very well ahead over that  weekend   yes that's what i think  i want i was gonna  going to do it last week and i thought well that maybe something you'd like to do   park plaza would be good cos it's right off the street from  mel   ya  four seasons would be good   so there'd be there'd be   you and me a and   mina mel and mary   and we could what we could get is two double rooms  mina mel and mary   cough   okay with a i would suggest that we get two double rooms with a sitting room  ya   and we'd just need it for two nights   okay   and that's close to where we're going to be  is it   alright  then we'll   either one  either the four seasons or the park plaza   we would need that for before the wedding  and for   we'd we'd need that ya  we'd need that uhm   and and where about  the night of of   i mean the night after  we need it for the night before the wedding and the night of the wedding and then then we're going to come home  cough   aren't we  or we could go to ron 's that last night huh  laugh depending depending  how we are   i would expect we'd drive back on uh new year's day  late-ish   this will be pretty   new year's day   or maybe we'd want to stay one more day  we might want to   mina won't  she'll want to go right back   i must get   ya   i can i can always send her back with grandma jeanette   cos they're coming down  well why couldn't she go with jennifer and james  she could do  ya   but you and i might want to take an e  extra day  ya  i see  well we just need one of those rooms 
Canada	 we don't need a whole suite  ya   but i think we better book the suite  ya  that make sense to you  ya that's fine  and they uh i met her hairdresser  who's going to do everybody's hair the day of  and he wanted us he wanted to know where cos he's going to bring all his equipment and do it in in    the hotel suite would be great  we'd have two   oh you can do it right in the hotel  oh ya he'll come up there  cos you don't want to do it in the salon says 'salaw'  be because the salon   pardon me  two words want can't  word how you say it in toronto   uhm  what do they call it salon   ya something like that  because it's closed on a sunday and he's doing this under the table  oh i see   he and his assistant will be doing  probably twelve heads of hair with uh with  any one   and he can bring all his own equipment  or does he use hotel's not 'the hotel's'   ya he'll bring everything   i mean the hotel must have stuff   no he'll bring everything   mhh  god isn't it gonna going to to be something else  it's gonna going to be a zoo  laugh   and i think i better get lunch brought in for everybody  up in the suite   it sounds terribly grand doesn't it  what time's the wedding  six   and then there're going to be pictures before  so we get everything cleaned up and do pictures in the hotel  so we'll need flowers in there too   wha it's gonna going to be   a mess   now i i'll have to get tails or ah a tuxedo or what   well it's it's black tie  so six o'clock would  be that would be tux i guess  black tie   okay   ya  okay   you could do tails  i don't know  heh  i think they're all just gonna going to  be doing tux  a couple of words anything else   i think i have one   ya if it fits  why wouldn't it  it might fit now  of course it'll fit  it wouldn't have fit a month ago  oh shut up  laugh it'll fit now though i think  so that'll be nice  so i m i must call her  what about uhm   i'll call her tomorrow   are they gonna going to   line up uh a limousine service  mhh hmm  they've done that  they've done that  mhh hmm  and the photographer and the music   the club's doing the rest  food's all done   now the rehearsal   she's chosen her menu  yup  what are they going to have  cornish hen  mhh   it's cheaper than steak or roast beef or whatever else it was going to do  and we're going to do that the night before   do what the night before   at at ron 's   the uh oh the   the rehearsal dinner   the rehearsal dinner   has uh lynne uhm uh the the or uh uh  whatever hamish and some other's name is   been in touch with lynne   yes  lynne   so that's all  that's all arranged  we don't have to worry about that   she she called me with the menu  yesterday and that was great  so we're all set with that   oh and they're going to do two head tables in the club   uhm cos she doesn't want a great long  hiccup pardon me  a long one  well now there's seven bridesmaids and seven ushers and a  that's why   i know  they wanted a wedding where they had twelve of each just not long ago  cough   when they were down here that weekend  imagine twleve  now who's her maid of honour  i thought mina   oh mina is  that's right  ya ya mina   okay   i was thinking amongst her friends and  no no no it's mina   cough   and she has stella haney now too  she's got stella as her   but not what's her name  she's not coming   no she's not coming  so i think it's going to be lovely  i'm i'm really uh  word   you excited  ya i'm beginning to be   so i have to call this lady in the hair word   so i think aside from uhm well there's always going to be a last minute collapse  suzy 's done the uhm invitations and they're  quite non-traditional  you mean she designed the designed  the the lettering   like like the whole  ya she took the whole thing and she's having   them printed and the whole thing  ya   everything   ya  oh isn't that great  it's a piece of paper folded folded   in four  you open it up   and she's not very maybe three words all the parents  how do you mean  well a few words or a business   and it's just   and their parents or something like that   oh ya   okay   oh i see  rather than names   mhh hmm mhh hmm mhh hmm  okay  cos it gets complicated with the uh the   steps and stuff  have you heard about uh uh ron coming and  well apparently he's coming but he hasn't coughed up any bread  well   promise promise promise  typical old story laugh but not a dime in the mail  anyways   his wife will never let him send it   see it as a tip  i put a down payment on  no  yes  i put t   this is the other thing  i'm gonna going to need some  maybe advance with   or get it from name   i put a ahh down payment on the dress and i've put five hundred bucks on the flowers already   that's just a down payment  mhh hmm  five hundred  mhh hmm  i figure it's quite good   against how much laugh   twenty-five hundred probably  uhm  don't forget the tablecloths  it's laugh gonna going to be obscene  so yup that's where we are   uhm   you wonder what kind of a day it's going to be eh at that time of the year with the  well whether we're going to be slobbering around in  boots and  boots and whatever  the service is six o'clock  it goes from six to six thirty   uhh we thought we'd get everybody over there and get settled and start cocktails at seven to eight thirty  she said she wanted that long   ya people won't like   that's a long time though  god  well wha wha they  have the reception line eh  well word the word    it's true eh  she doesn't want a reception line but she's going to have to have  one   oh she has to   we have we have to have  okay i'll tell her even you says  dinner at eight thirty  ya  they gonna going to have dancing at   the dinner   oh ya   oh ya  so the the club provides a band or  orchestra or   no sh hamish   has something lined up  okay  they're closing the bar at one and the club  gets closed at three  that's a good idea   and they pay uhh it's a what do you call those statutory holiday so they have to pay double  time to to the  uhh whatever to the to the  staff after midnight   one and a half   double   jeez laugh   well it's it's tough   it's still cheaper than the hotel  much  ya  and uhm i've told mel and i'll tell hamish  again too but they should disappear at twelve thirty and go and get changed   so that people it's a signal to  the you know the old types old traditional types  that won't leave until the bride goes  ya that they can go home   they can they can  come back down in their jeans if they like but they're  they're to get out of their finery and maybe   we can go home ya laugh   i figure we can go home when the bar closes  oh man  i don't know whether you want to do anything the next day  i'm not prepared to do it  i'm gonna going to be too tired but   maybe   like what   well lunch with  entertaining more  more entertaining  oh i don't know   the out-of-town visitors  uncle jim 's not coming  he called me  oh really   he he called and said he was coming and then his wife got said   there was too much on and said they'll not come  so   well it it mick and jamie   will come and   ya definitely and jack and maisy   i think and   okay   we could we could do a lunch the next day but i don't know that we neal really  need to   the out of town people we could uh   well exhale well let's think about that  i mean i think we're g we'll have   had enough frankly by that time  we will have  ya   cos that will be new year's day  ya  so you get out-of-towner people there they  a few words getting up word  i expect the kids are going to go on and on  now they're going to go to paris for their honeymoon  oh i that's what i was going to ask you  ya they've decided  they d decided   oh that's what they're going to do  mhh hmm  melanie doesn't like sitting on the beach sirens start in background   hamish would like to  so this is their   well they're not going to sit on the beach in  paris in january that's for sure   not in paris in january no no  for how long are they going for   a week or two  ya   that's all they have cos mel has class heh  she's going to miss one week of class  it's too bad mina won't be back  they could go over to switzerland and visit her there but she'll be here still   laugh   she'll be here still  oh god i gotta have got to do something about those two words   uhm i'm not going to have a corsage and neither is my mother  so we may not do corsages for anybody  but i i refuse to wear one  ya  it would look quite nice on you  in the pictures of brian's wedding  word   it was important for him because he  word listen to that  goodness what was that  fire engines   ambulances and fire and everything  else sirens stop   that's fire   no but i you know i   h hate i just don't like em  them   i think you know that  i had i had a feeling that you don't like corsages   laugh   and my mother doesn't either   and mina certainly takes after you  you take after your mother  she doesn't like them  no she doesn't like em them  either  so i'll just check with val   if she doesn't mind none of us will have them  if she wants one she can have one  ya okay   oh sure  and allison darcy will buy  allison one if she wants  sure   why should why should   i have to pay for one  if she comes   she won't let him come alone  good heavens no   so that's the wedding stuff i think  i guess i should book joni in eh for that   week here at the   yup   ya i think so  well  well you can't take her down there  nobody's going to be able to look after her then  we could leave her at kim 's place laugh  and pay for another cleaning lady  it's probably cheaper   but she's been so good here  apparently she messed the house down word    well they do that eh if it's not their own home  ohh  we went out for supper that night that i was there and there was a huge big wet spot on the carpet when we came back and i don't know whether laurie really thought it was uh   frankie   joni or frankie   she acted as if she did but she probably suspected that it was joni   joni never does that  well she word   she doesn't do it at mary 's  no but she doesn't we've never   left her alone   she doesn't do it anywhere else you take her   i mean uh uh she didn't have either of us there  it's true eh  i went to see her once in that time when i was down there  before and she went bananas  i know  you told me   and then i felt so badly leaving her i didn't go back the next time until i was leaving  leaving her   laugh   but boy you know i kept thi  thinking she wouldn't know me but she just went nuts  we had a really hard time subduing her  i'm glad brian was there  she jumped all over him   that's something you could do without at that  point  ya 
Canada	 and the other funny thing about that was i don't know whether i told you on the phone or not but uhm kim brought us in and made us coffee and suzy came up in her dressing gown from downstairs and i thought oh god brian 's gonna  going to have a fit  you're gonna going to be so uncomfortable  and i asked him in the car  i said well i he said i was  wondering whether they were married or not  i couldn't remember what he had told me laugh   who's what who is he to talk for   goodness sake about people being married or not married  laugh i know   well he he he they're so straight   poor brian   must get that from his father  i don't know   maybe his wife  laugh well that could be  mhh hmm   she still has the girl's rooms and the boy's rooms   so there's the uh that's that stuff   who's fiore  is that the  that the flo florist   that's just my down payment  i have to keep all these bills  this is my wedding book you see   now the other thing we haven't got on the list  i have a list of people that i put on   i didn't do any of your family except for the kids  but i think we should have carmen roddick   i didn't put her on  we better ask her  ya   uhm what have i got  the hansons rick and bobbi   jenny polly tom and fran   i don't think any of my   who won't come  uhm maris   oh god we have to have maris   i guess we do   ya we can't can't not  maybe i'd rather go and raid her house and get all my  inheritance from my dad that word took off  laugh   uhm the adair 's  and we're going to ask sally and her boyfriend  mhh hmm  vince and jerry and arles   uhm matthew and elaine   the mcintyre 's   you gonna going to  ask the honeywell 's  they've been asked   or will be asked  brian and jeanette owen   portia and bill hayes   and i haven't talked to portia but i could scratch them off  i need word   she's coming for sure  jim and andy weston   jim and jenny honeywell   do you think they'll come up uh the weston  's  mhh hmm  for sure  really  mhh hmm   the anderson 's   word mcsweeny   definitely coming  i took the white 's off  no i think i put them back on   hanson 's i didn't put in  tom ch thompson   michael rennish   and uhm i think i didn't put elaine in  okay  so graham won't know anybody  it's no point in asking really do ya you  think  no   but that's not so much on our our   part of the list  so you feel that things are pretty well uh under control   i i have to keep on top of stuff   what's that a magazine of weddings  no that's the horoscopes  you know me   oh for gosh sakes  i i  </} was reading this in the hairdresser maybe two words   and i just thought i picked this up and i thought  we have to we have to read these  these are funny   uh here we are  what's this for  for for uh weddings or something  no no no it's just for this month  so there's mine  that's the one i read  and then i read yours   i think you're very funny   telling you you're brilliant is a waste of time because you already know that  it can be frustrating though when you try to convince the rest of the world that you're not just a one dimensionable one dimensional cardboard dummy doomed to speak only through a ventriloquist voice cough   as the moons nodes cross the axis of your third and ninth houses    whatever that is   over the next eighteen months you may find that a lot of supposedly intelligent people are just too darned narrow-minded to listen to you   well that's the story of my life  well right i thought the whole thing was   even if you swear laugh you've just gotten back from mount sinai with the latest word laugh from you-know-who  laugh   cough   oh dear  what's yours   five bucks say you probably have to restrain yourself from rolling your eyes and groaning when well-meaning friends and astrologers tell you to hang in there until saturn moves out of pisces next spring that's a laugh as far as you're concerned no matter where saturn may have been    which is saturn anyway   doesn't ma matter   it's not on here  oh it's not there  it it's the stars dear   no matter where saturn may have been you've been hanging in there since the first day you were forced out of the playpen and made to walk  in your current spiritual mood you'd laugh out loud to hear that love life or at least your sex life is far from over  well start laughing and hang in there   well  so what do you think about that huh  i'll tell you heh   ya ya ya ya ya i'm not so sure  i think it was funny  ya it is funny   anyway that was my week  it was good  it was really good i think  but you haven't talked to brian yet  i haven't been able to get him  i phoned him last night and i phoned him the night before and i haven't been able to reach him  what does he work  tuesday thursday  i didn't think he was going to work  yes  he was  yes   well then if he that would have been  the reason i didn't get him last night he was it would have been that he was at work  and i guess mindy was out  uh oh   so today's wednesday  maybe i'll get him today  it's tuesday and thursday he works   mhh hmm   i think you'll probably get through today and find out what's happening with uhm marcus   ya   now anything more you wanna want to   do about marc   i don't know what to do darling  i spoke to him i spoke to him  very briefly on the phone and  i don't think there's anything more to do   what did he say to you  he didn't really say very much   uh he was just interested to know why i was where i was  i would have thought everybody would have told him laugh   i i was obviously i hadn't seen him  he hadn't been in touch with me at all   oh uh oh i see  well did you get a chance to speak to him at the wedding  no much  no  he's uhm   according to brian   i better check that with him obviously  he's really withdrawing from the family  he's really wants to he thinks that he's got his calling now and that he's gotta got to   take up his other family and that uh he can't do that if he's got this worldly family  i see   well what can ya you do  i don't think there's   jennifer has had a talk with him  i don't think a thing   i guess and he said he wasn't going to go to the wedding or was thinking not going and apparently she got him  spoke to him   she didn't get him going   well she she said when he was talking to her he was crying on the telephone   ya but she didn't get him going  he was calling mindy to say that he wasn't coming  everybody had had a crack on him at him  except me  cos i hadn't talked to him  but it was mindy 's mother who c   answered the phone  nobody else was home  and she just took a strip off him and told him that uh she wouldn't accept any of this uh stuff  laugh   that he said god wouldn't  encourage him to come  ya   and she said god would be very very angry with you if you don't come  this is your brother and this is your duty and you're responsible to your family to come  and she's a religious person so there   she's   so he was on the next plane  hmm  but we didn't know where he was going to go after  we tried to uhm  kim wanted to take him home for a while and ron  was prepared to bring him back but he   he wouldn't have any of it   no and he wouldn't go to the reception  and he left the wedding when they came to sign the register   hmm  uh uh uh uh there's nothing more that we can do about it i guess  really   there's nothing you can do   mhh hmm   sign all the rest of the papers and the money has been released now for the word   so it can last until christmas  ya maybe three words   or shortly after   it's awfully hard to think him think him  just you know dropping out like that  out of life and out of of any contact  but i i honest to god don't know   what to do   i don't think there's anything you can do honey  can you relax about it a bit  i haven't thought about it very much to tell you the truth  uhh in the last month  no   but there it it's just it's just it's just so sad because if he  i was thinking of this lad up there who was schizophrenic and uh you know he was he was doing fine  heavy medication   but he was basically normal otherwise you know   that's really sad   anyhow   and then of course the other condition just aggravated everything  ya   hmm  how did he get there  hmpf  how did he get there  did he was he sent by someone or did he go on his own or  is this what he's asking me  that's what i'm asking you  this kid that you were telling me  i'm asking about him   ohh oh oh   ya sorry i thought you were asking about marc still  no   nah i don't know  i i think his family did  he he was quite young  i mean he'd probably be in his twenties  how old   okay  and uh i think his family uh you know they seem to be very close and in touch with him   hmm   i di didn't  really get the whole story you you know   but uh i just knew that he was on heavy medication  which they had to control there  you know what i mean  they they had to hand it out to him  but uhm   okay so hmm  what would you like to do for the rest of the  today   well uhm i'd like to maybe just dance through anything that's important in that mail  i don't wanna want to deal with it   mhh hmm   uh i don't i can't see anything that's very important   uhm i wouldn't mind a little lie down   mhh hmm  how about you  i'm very tired  ya well why don't we do that   and then go out fairly early for dinner   i was up quite early today too  not as early as you were word but uh  did i wake ya you up this morning when i called  no i but i was uhm still in bed  i was   ya no i i woke up   i'm not sleeping well  no   that's again part of the problem   and i have to do something about calling the other doctor  ya well i gotta have got to     but i think basically i'm doing okay  the i bet you've even forgotten that i was sick eh  no i haven't forgotten that you were sick   it's been a while  it certainly has   what else is what   uhh i spoke to them up there about phoenix and they thought i you know p  probably let that go for a while   ya i think so  i think so too  because its not 'it' puts you on show again  ya  i i never thought that was a good idea actually   so i think i'll uh i think i'll   let that uh  i think that's something   well it was a good idea at the time  well when you were okay but/[> i would let that go now  ya   sniff   ya   because it it feeds right in to that myth that you're creating of whatever  mhh hmm  uhm   are you gonna going to   do anything more about the uhm this week about the   church   this week   well i'll probably phone uh may tomorrow but  i you know i'd i'd rather get  the home stuff done first  the home stuff done first   that's what i that's sort of the plan   that i made in my mind when i  mhh hmm   that's why i was asking  ya uhm i before i came down  and uh  that's why why i'd just  like to get some sort of feel for it   unless there's something absolutely terribly  i don't know how janice already is but  uhm  they say it's a bit better apparently   the one terry mason 's not good   she not   not well at all  no i wouldn't think so   and she's being dreadful to the staff and that's upset  john terribly  where is she  general still isn't she   still   ya  i think so  ya  he did his rounds on saturday  and it's his one day off heh and he was just exausted and  just just completely emotionally whipped   i wonder why he felt he had to do that 
Canada	" you know whether he wanted to do it or   well cos he cos he knew   i'd do it if he didn't  exhale   i think he did it so i didn't   cos i talked to him about and they didn't want me to do it so  sniff   mhh  may 's been very good about keeping in touch   ya i gather   she's been superb about that  they've they've got hearts of gold the two of them   mhh hmm   you know they're   they are two of the most wonderful people   mhh   and very fond of you  very fond and very loyal towards you  ya   and very concerned   i really appreciated that too   ya   eww look what joni 's got  uhm   a burr's smashed into her hip a few words   i noticed a thing upstairs from the uhm   that uh the sh the uhm sh uh sawbridge club you know  oh we weren't gonna going to do that  ya  no there there seems to be another one there  or unless   i i don't think it's the one i originally had  there's an envelope up there  that's right  from   did you speak to ron again  about it   yes   that's what the one he called me about first and then they  ya   we have to get two sponsors  i mean they're obviously one and can tell us somebody else who we can approach  but i think that i think that's i'm looking forward to that   i i think that's a great idea  and i'm glad   we can go up and s spend friday night i mean you know   ya ya   get up crack up of dawn or something  it's it's not expensive  no it's not expensive at all  so i think that's a great idea  except the traffic's always awful on a friday night  ya   people go up to ski on a saturday   though prob probably  i don't think it's as bad as it is in the summer   cos a lot of people if they go skiing they don't go up till saturday morning  oh the ski traffic is awful   people who are going skiing   that's true   so i don't think that'll be too bad  so there's that and and we'll go over  about to the about the y y.m/w.c.a.   ya  what do you want to do there  well i think i should go and see somebody  you know what i mean if you're over i don't know  fifty-five   mhh hmm   fifty   fifty  ya  i had to do it   you should go and see somebody and uh  they'll i guess map out some kind of program   program for you   you're really going to go over and go out and sweat  i don't know laugh   well i if i'm going to join i guess i will  ya   may as well do it  you gotta have got to do it every day  oh my god   i'm just going to swim   i'm wondering if i can get just a swimming thing or maybe  get get ten passes at a time or something  i don't  you don't wanna want to do the other stuff  i don't like it  mhh  word and and  i'm not supposed to be  actually i'm not allowed to do it yet  i don't wanna want to  be   ha how do you like that  when are you gonna going to be able to do stuff like that  do you know   well i don't know  she said absolutely no way to two words any of that stuff  if i want to swim and do ten lengths that's that's  fine but uh no more  walking is good  uh huh   no lifting no pushing  when you take joni up the mountain do you take that steep path  yes  is that alright  no problem  stairs are fine   oh   ya  hmm  i let her go  if she was pulling me it might be a problem   well i know that but i just thought it was kind of steep  i wondered if you'd go around the other side where  it's not quite so steep and go up that  path   mhh uh   no   i've just been going straight up   i don't get lost that way  it's important you know   laugh how can you get lost on westmont mountain  easy  i get lost anywhere  you know that  and i always go the same route too just cos i'm afraid of getting lost  laugh oh dear   i might try another one tomorrow   but she does love it and then it makes her uh settled for the day you know  ya   it's much better for her   no as as for going back to work  ya i was gonna going to ask you that in a minute   uhm i'm not allowed to go back till the nineteenth  ya  till i see her again   see her again ya  but i would like to ease in a little bit  i'm gonna going to go in tomorrow for an hour  i like to go through my mail and stay on top of stuff  ya  and   the problem is though that if you do that then you get  you know you gotta have got to make up your mind that that's what you're gonna going to  do  only go in for an hour   because once you get in there you don't tend to get out in an hour  mhh hmm   so i'll go in late morning   mails yes, "" mail's"" comes at about eleven  go through the mail  i've got stuff to finish off that i brought home  but i've been going on monday to get ready for my class  which i don't consider work incidently   i enjoy it so much and it  gives me   ya   where where uhm where   are you teaching  tall building  that's good  mhh hmm  good class  i had thirty - three this time  thirty   lots of guys  how are you going to do all that marking over christmas this year with the wedding on  it's gonna going to be tough    i know  how many guys  three  no no many more  i think about twelve   about a third of your group  mhh hmm  a little more  that's good  and all in that whole class all  except one is working   isn't that extraordinary   really   are they are they working in that field  all except one of them are working word    no uhh no  they're most of them are in  service  just at jobs   o one guy   a couple of guys in uh uh working in  consumer's distributors and uh you know handling parcels and boxes and things  but most of them are in banks or in in   uh trust companies on the front line  service service service  mhh   so they're really interested in some of these things   uhm almost all are involved in or want have i was involved in human resource management word    mhh hmm   hmm  but really quite an interesting group  i've just got one one kid looks like a bit of a pain  who wants you know to me to show him exactly which parts of the notes he should be studying for the exams i  gotten   i'm just gonna going to  to say there no laugh i'm not prepared to do that  isn't that a word   wants to meet with me next week for an hour  i said that's fine i'll be happy to meet with you a  any questions but i will not show you what to study  what's the word on the uh crazy guy who threatened you   no nothing more   you've never heard any more  no  do you know if he's out or  he's out  he's out  ya   well he wouldn't find me now probably   ya   he's definitely out  oh there's a new lawyer at the university now too  working with sam doing the uh h r stuff   all of the uhm personnel law or whatever you call  it labour relations law  ya   ya  and she's doing some of the c s s t commission de la sant&eacute; et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; du travail legal stuff  which is very good  i'm pleased  huh  she seems to be excellent  sian sian 's  impressed with her  so is colleen   and how is rachel making out  mhh not so great   she seems to have a vitamin b twelve problem on top of everything else  hmm  but her lupus seems to be more or less under control  she's working at home but she's getting anxious that contracts aren't coming as fast as she'd like them   that's the problem with being an consultant  but i think that's her niche  uhh when she eventually gets to be known  mhh hmm   but it it it does take time and i guess she's impatient  it's understandable but i guess she is  oh she's just anxious  ya  security they don't she doesn't  have any  you see that's the problem  just what she what she can earn  mhh hmm  but she's got a few fairly stable contracts but uh   we've got to get her over one point soon   one thing i did while i was away i sent uh a  a list of my questions for my exam down to the examiner  when did you have time to do that  oh i did  i did when was visiting at saturday afternoons i felt i wasn't taking time for  nobody was doing anything then so i worked on the questions and   i i uhm i uh faxed them down to him about  ten days ago  they have a fax there  no  they do but he can't use it  the i i there was a uh little printer's shop in in the town that had a   a fax machine  so i faxed it down to him about ten days ago  uh i i just told him that   in the in the letter that i'd really like to try and write that exam by the end of this month   man are you moving after all this  diddling  around   ya   i'd like to get it done  wow  but there's no there's no   use uh uh de   de de delaying   anymore   there's no point de delaying    no   they're going to kick you out of the program   i know as i know as   i know as much as uh as   i will ever know about uh  you gotta have got to do something   buddhism and  ya well about the co uh the   uh  you know i mean any more reading i do is just redundant  mhh hmm   now which which one is this one you're  gonna going to be doing  which  this is the one on uh buddhism and uh   it's on buddhism and voluntary death in other words  you're doing an exam on that   ya  oh   in other words it will include buddhist attitudes towards  uhh abortion uh suicide and euthanasia   mhh hmm   and like all you know i mean they their   the the religion   by by its teaching proscibes any of those but they're very much a part of japanese buddhist culture   well for sure   you think of the kamikaze pilots and  and   but where does that come from  there must be another influence that   well they they uhh they're  they're able  for example the intention with which you uh commit suicide is extremely important to them   and if you are totally non - self-absorbed your intention is focused upon service to the emperor or service to the uh uhm uhm   w whatever then uh then  it's not really considered suicide  remember those uh   a sacrifice  it's a sacrifice uhh for a higher purpose  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  remember those uhm vietnamese monks who  burned themselves in  the viet viet   vietnam war   mhh hmm   that's right   that wasn't suicide  that's not sui suicide     that was sacrifice   they don't they don't  term it as sacrifice   it's martyrdom or sacri  sacrifice sacri   sacrifice   it's a it's a   drawing attention   it's more of a sacrifice isn't it   ya it's more a sacrifice   ya   they're drawing attention to an issue which is not just theirs  it's it's it's global or   or   uh you know the people of vietnam in that particular situation were the ones who   uh they wanted to draw the attention of the world to the suffering of the uh vietnamese people   so the intention   in fact for any uh buddhist the the uh i mean the practising ones the intention at your time   what's what's in your mind at the time of your death whether it's even natural causes is extremely important  because "
Canada	 what's in your mind at the time of death why  why does maybe two words   well because uhh when you die it  because they have this belief in reincarnation  the cycular   circular nature of things then that what you are at that moment is transmitted into some other  uh uh that is just being conceived  and uh is   is bir   a few words   ya   creature  being   uh huh   so is that when it happens  at the moment of conception   at conception   and that's another thing that makes abortion very   inter interesting   so the moment of conception and the moment of death there has to be a couple of mumbled words   ya and then and then   there you know there's a lot of predetermination in it in the sense that you uhh uhm   there's a law the law of karma that works  and and law of karma means you inherit what you deserve from your previous incarnation and it lives on and the next until you've worked yourself either up the   the ladder to nirvana or down into forms of lower existence   mhh hmm   and it's uhh uh uh it's really very very it's very interesting   but intention is uh   but there's a case in the one of the uhh the uhh  nagoya supreme court in nineteen sixty something i think that has to do with euthanasia  and it lays down the conditions under which accepted euthanasia  uhm and it is almost the same as what  there were about six qualifications  that it's the will of the person who's dying either expressed then or at some previous time  that it is done by doctors uh and so on  but but there's one   and the docus doctors  are pardoned for doing this   uhh i don't think they need pardoned  they don't need pardoned anyways  no   okay   but uh they the   the condition is that the the   person must be at peace of mind at the time and i don't think that's  mhh hmm   the conditions are pretty well the same as in western cultures but not that peace of mind   that peace of mind is important  isn't it  ya   ya   tremendously important   uh huh  and another thing uh uh well about abortion in japan   th they the the uhm there's no question in their mind but that life begins at conception  mhh hmm  so they don't debate that issue   you know  it's just simply not a   it begins at conception  so so the fetus   mhh hmm   i'm gonna going to make you sugar and cream  okay   although this is a very nice sugar  well i w i want you to make me sugar and cream   i know   you know i'm just getting good   and i want   well you're they're great  they're all really great those  you haven't even seen any of my stuff  i have so  i've seen lots of your stuff  but you haven't seen all of them  your pots   no not all of it  but there's lots of it  that shouldn't take too long before it's drinkable   i would think  that's okay   i would hope  uhm so where can you  ya so she phones   ya  laugh she's so incredibly not on this planet  why   to tell me that she was waiting for violet  halloween night   i'm sorry that i didn't see her  was this was anything prearranged  no  no she just sits at home every halloween night with her  costume on and waits for the kids to come by  and waits   and all the other kids do  but she didn't say anything to you guys like hey don't forget to bring vi by or it'd be really nice to see her  no  no she doesn't have time to do that but she has time three days later to say   to be martyr-mom   word serious martyr-mom  i was so upset that i didn't see violet   and then she has no concept of who  you know you sort of tell violet a story and she says oh ya   laugh   laugh   but she has a a word    but she doesn't know her from adam   no   no  you know her  you know you you sort of  anticipate what the responses are and all that stuff  mhh hmm   she hasn't learned   well the terrible thing i think for violet is that i see her growing rapidly bored with her cousins and her aunts and uncles  the older she gets she's gonna going to  get really bored with them  well that that that's not a big deal  mhh uh  so she does  mhh   i had minimal contact with my cousins until adulthood  and then i searched them out and that's   gr great you know  that's a good thing   mhh hmm   ya   okay so what else did she say   oh jamie felt this  you know jamie was so upset about the referendum  like jamie wa was   is the only anglophone in quebec that we know  laugh   or jamie didn't sleep the night before   i said did you go to any rallies  you know no   laugh   no but i had a canada flag in my car laugh   oh ya  oh she didn't say anything  the worst effect of her that her phone calls have is that i sit there and say oh barry she's such a jerk  ya laugh   and of course i call and go oh god i called you again i was calling my dad  and barry goes oh well i'm on the other line with my mom  and i went what for   laugh   well it just has to be a fact of making   like for some reason i thought maybe he called her or something  ya   i mean like why  and this is just gonna going to   let   cos it never occurred to me that that  that she would have actually called him  no she called  and i thought he was in with violet putting her to bed so i didn't dare interrupt him  ohh   in fact he was reading the newspaper  i could have killed him  oh my god  cos he came sort of sauntering up and i'd been through hell on wheels with her  did he put her to bed  i would never uh  what did she say   i would never live with my kids  hooo  where on earth did she get that from  well she does live with her kid for one  and i was she was talking about how she wanted to have an apartment and i said well  oh i'm sorry you oh you're  talking about his mom   this is no this is  barry 's mom   oh i thought this was violet   oh no   no  barry 's mother would never imposed her will on her children  ahh laugh   and i you know i sit there and say  oh no of course you wouldn't  like what kind of a shot are you taking at my mom  wha you know what are you doing   mhh hmm   anyway  that's weird  ya   well no that's typical  she's such a jerk   she's she's a complete and utter manipulating   passive aggressive cow   she's such a huge manipulator   mhh hmm  she's a waste of life   god it's it's just  astounding that barry 's as brilliant as he is faint background noises; shouting?   street noises   i have googly in my tea   so how are you feeling   you're very busy  i'm very busy  i'm feeling kind of weird  uhm i'm feeling sort of detached  i'm feeling   from   just life in general  from   no no actually  not from life in general but from uhm the issue   although every once in a while i just think of the two of them together and i just s just like  something inside of me wants to erupt  and then what happens  and then i go no don't buy into that  don't go off on that tangent  just  you can do a mental image thing  you can do like a a a crunch your hands and stop screaming thing  oh okay  well i never thought laugh about that   i read about that   oh did you  ya  there's a book i should give you  feeling good the new mew new  mood therapy  oh jesus laugh christ   laugh no no no but it will   the whole premise of it is behaviourism and and  it will  you can't control your thoughts but you can can control the beliefs that lead to your thoughts or your actions when you have those thoughts   two words   okay  so if you say tia and gary and then you say stop you can  ya  but i was just i just i mean i just   find it annoying  no not annoying  i find it really intensely hurtful still so  if you can stop looking at it as something that was done to you it might help   that's ya  and actually for the first time in my whole life i'm actually being able to intellectualize it that way  ryan was always ew i took everything ryan did way too personally  like it was me an an  aggression towards me   and half of it was  but i mean the uhm the  non-overt stuff  the overt stuff was not directed at me i guess  and   well see it makes sense for you to interpret it that way in a lot of ways because all of your actions were being guided the effect it would have on gary   ya ya  so   so it would make sense that you would think that his actions would be  mhh hmm     well it was interesting i had  why did anne quit work  i don't know  uhm   she didn't seem to give barry any  she wasn't fired though  no no  oh   but i wonder why  i don't know  i have no idea   i can't see that she would have felt weird about uh   i mean i hope i mean tia has to understand that like barry 's not pleased with her and you're not pleased with her and a whole bunch of people are   oh i don't think she cares   why would she care  cos i think she sorta sort of   felt that we all had sort of that there was i don't know i think because she thought there was some basis in a friendship  with us all or something  but it was really interesting cos gerry folsom when i worked with him on the other day he said oh i saw tia and gary  at the black tomato and i went oh ya  laugh   so i brought him up to speed and he was so cute  he said doesn't that just make you sm  wanna want to like just don't you just get   so angry about that  isn't that the nastiest thing you could ever find out  and i said ya   laugh   he said ya word   it's really interesting how people will tell you   he was really he was really  uhm   he said that's just low  that's low  ya   you know and   oh and jasmine sat there saying yes yes keep on   and i sat there saying ya ya it was mean   laugh   makes you wanna want to spit   laugh   ya  so but he said that when he walked in he looked around cos he was looking for a friend and then he turned around and saw  tia and gary and tia was trying to sort of hide  she was just like trying not to make eye contact with him but of course he said i just went over and said hi and everything  and i s i thought well you know that's really interesting  obviously if she had that reaction to seeing someone who she knew would be seeing me who she knew knew her  knew the whole story and that she had that reaction you would think that they might have discussed the  im you know the reaction i would have  and have said something like well maybe  you gary should tell her   and   and this should be dealt with  ya   ya   ya   what's plan a   ya   ya  uhm and the other thing is when i found out gary was seeing someone new uhm i said to him then since you and i are maintaining a friendship although it's going to be a friendship that's   gonna going to take some time and we're not you know gonna going to be able to achieve that for maybe you know a while  oh you guys had analysis-of-friendship discussions  we had one   you you had like a plan as to how you were 
Canada	 well i said to him look i it's   really   wow i didn't know that   ya i said look it's really important to me that we be friends and that we you know at some later date we be able to you know have breakfast or or  go to a movie or just sit and talk  have breakfast   or not run him over in the street  i just don't i just don't want anything to end badly here  i don't want there to be a crisis  i just want it to end nicely   okay so when you found out about the woman  i said okay fine  first of all i asked him if it was anyone i knew and he wouldn't tell me  he didn't say yes or no  he did didn't   he said uhm i don't want to talk about it  uh that's a good friend laugh   i said i said okay fine  gary   that's fine  i said just so long as it isn't somebody i know  oh so you and you   didn't right   and   and then i said to him now under no uncertain circumstances does this person come to the restaurant  the restaurant is off limits   and he said no you're absolutely right  i would never do that  uhm i understand completely  oh you never told me that   so you see  oh ya   so you see this is why when i found out it was her and what was going on and everything that's why   the whole issue just made me freak   but see you had no right to set limits on   well he he should have laid it out at that point  it was the perfect opportunity  cos it was underway when you had this  conversation   exactly   oh ya   he was seeing her that night  uh god  so you could have said he could have said   at this point well surprise it's tia   and i would have said okay well this is gonna  going to cause a problem  uhm we'll just have to deal with it carefully and   no you would have lost your mind   no i would have had a fit  of course i would have had a fit  i'm no one is saying i wouldn't have a fit  laugh   and i'm being totally honest  i would have had a fit right there on the phone   but then it would have been it would have been mean to g get it would have been what i would have had to do to get over it   i would have been afraid of you   ya but i would have been afraid of you if i had been gary  and he's a big coward   oh of course   he's a big coward  ya  so he wouldn't tell me the truth and instead it's like this  and so what's gonna going to happen is  i don't know  like i still don't want us to not be friends  oh jasmine why  what's uh how is he of use  to you  no no no no i mean   oh you don't wanna want to hate him  i don't wanna want to hate him  it's the history thing  it's the twenty years  it's the knowing  it's just  this is a fantasy this twenty years  you had him as a teacher in high school  ya  you did not speak to him for seventeen years and then you went out   no no that's not true   we used to we used to like have conversations everytime we bumped into each other  it wasn't there was   no it's just because of   he was never an element in your  wha if you were to list your twenty best friends gary would never have come up  cos i certainly never heard his name in six years   no no no no no of course not  but there was a period like when i was babysitting the kids  and he and i would s you know there were   a couple of times when i'd go over and we'd just sit on the back  deck and talk  ya   ya you have a hundred people like this in  your life   there were some   that's right   but there was an element  and just because of the the nasty period of time that that surrounded  ya  i just want it to all be nasty  i don't want everything   because i felt he was someone i could go and talk to when things were really not very nice  ya  and i just would like to feel in some way shape or form that  uhm something wasn't completely horrible out of that period of time  well i get that  i get it   okay but what if something what if there was not  one good thing about that time except the fact that you got out of it  oh   it just makes it more dreadful  why  i don't know cos it's such a it's   three words   but it might be the truth  well you know but in six months i may not feel this way  ya   like in six months i may just say screw it  i don't care about anything that happened back then  it's all gone now   but because everything is suddenly raw again   it's weird   ya see this phone rings is  wh what   i'm just gonna going to pause it now  recording stops for an unconfirmed time   okay we're back on again  okay good  uhm   that was a phone call laugh   laugh anyway well enough about those idiots  but anyway i'm just uh   well i thought of something when i was out uhm the more you try to manipulate it into him being in your past and if you could fix that you could fix your past the more you're  like you're trying to put  ohh i'm not trying to fix my past through him  well you're trying to see that one thing wasn't yucky about it  i'm just trying   well ya  well it's just like   i could play it back for you if you  laugh wanted me to   ya word laugh   well ya it's like i'd like to think that that  somehow you know  well i'd just like to not think that everything has been horrible  well that's easy  you can do that without him  ya  oh no i don't feel like i need   exhale it's funny  i'm becoming more and more detached from him in a way  it's starting  it's starting  i think a lot of it has to do with uh going numb on the subject  which is good cos uhm i just don't know how i mean it's just i'm starting to uh i'm just tired of it  probably three words   do you regret any behaviour   no i don't think i did anything i don't think i did anything wrong   no i was really  i was   no way  i was more honest with uh him than i've ever been with anybody  i was upfront  i made demands on him that were not unreasonable for two people in a relationship   and uh i wasn't  no  and i think that's   so you wouldn't do anything differently  no  well put it to bed then  ya i should  well i have to  i mean that's what i'm hoping to  laugh   i mean i kept thinking like did i push him  did i  no all i wanted him to do was acknowledge some level of emotional commitment so that i wouldn't be sitting around thinking well what's going on now  it's been sort of six months  it's been a year  ya it was it was the lying  and that's all  that's all i wanted to know   ya and he didn't lie with words he  ler he lied with his actions  that's right and i unfortunately allowed his actions to speak for him when i should have said gary   are you you know are you interested in pursuing this   ya   because and when i gave him     you gave up control   you grabbed control at one point  that's right   i had control and then i gave up control  like when i said are you interested in pursuing this relationship  he sai said   he would say yes   ya   and then he would say then i would say  fine uhm  and you would do the weekend attachment stuff and  then he'd back off   well are you   that's right  and and so it would be well i just didn't know how ta to how to   fit in and then i started to get angry and frustrated because i didn't want to feel like i had to fit into something  like well all of the sudden i was compromising myself  so the frustration led to the confrontations and the confrontations led to him bolting and that was it  so you know there you go  well i really like that you wouldn't do anything   that you don't regret anything   no i don't regret a single thing   talk i got so upset about about get when i got off the phone with barry 's mom i was like all of a sudden ching-ching  it was all in a row  these offensive things that she had said  these really agressive things hostile things that she had said to me and i had sat there and said uhh uh huh laugh  you know that's right   ya   and then i get off and i get all angry  so of course barry calls her back and i'm mad at  barry for three hours because he just called her back  ya  because it was his job to defend me to guess what he said that could have pissed me off to react ta   to her  in ways that was my responsibility to do  mhh hmm   ya   ya   i love this table  laugh   i wanna want to know what these nail holes are though  ya i do too  and i wanna want to know who put them here and why  and what are these little goobers  there's little naily things all the way  around   there's a circle in here   ya right around   like somebody's really like dicked around with this table  they've kind of word   well they've they've had a skirt on it or something like a vanity  inhale   oh god how awful laugh   but it's neat  i am glad i bought it and uhm it seems fairly solid  ya  i think i n i have to buy something to keep the wood happy  you know like some moisturizing lotion for wood or something so it doesn't dry   laugh   i don't know what you're supposed  i guess it's just varnish is supposed to do that but  ya  you don't know erin steen at all eh  no  you weren't she was way before you  at torrence   erin steen ya   she worked at torrence   she taught aerobics  mhh hmm  she had everything together  she married money   she has three kids now  wow   she's really i like her   mhh hmm  i like her but sh she   you know she had an agenda when she was at  torrence   she was gonna going to   i think she had just met this husband  and barry and i went to her wedding and then we didn't see her for six years  oh my god  and then i met her coming out of daycare or   at you know carlingwood or something with  violet   mhh hmm   and she has three kids and violet 's sort of in the middle of them   but she's one of these possum mothers  like she was born to be a mother  she was sad when her first kid went to grade one  whereas i would be dancing the hora  oh   laugh   laugh   but she's always got and and one of her kids she has this little eccentric  three year old alison whose voice is like this 'is like this' spoken in a deep voice   laugh she's great  and she has these huge eyes  barry 's just in love with alison   oh my god  what a riot   and she sits on his lap and stuff  and and she's really funny   and she has this kim va novak kind of voice  ya  wow  ya  and she's this tall  she's two feet tall or whatever she is  ya she's great  laugh   but today i saw her in mcdonald's with a she had an angel costume and a halo high-heeled shoes and  oh ya   where do they live 
Canada	" well she lives down in wychwood  she lives in aylmer  oh   and they settled there  paul or you know the husband is boring and bald and   wealthy and boring laugh   laugh   and bald laugh   laugh ya ya and he's had two different companies  well that's quite funny   but she she just she amazes me because she said to me i was explaining to her that i was  going coming here to have a conversation for an hour and she said laugh what are you nuts with violet  ya   she said i'll take violet and i was like god i wish i called you  ya   ya  so   wow   hmm that's funny   no i think things are actually plugging along in a very interesting way  i think it'll all end up being  and i've got an appointment to go and see my doctor on wednesday at eleven thirty  ya   ya   i've just gotta got to   get a vehicle so i can get out there cos he's way out   where is he   oh he's in barrhaven practically   what is that barrhaven  it's like woodroffe and baseline and far away   that barrhaven   well no but you know it's in that  it's towards orleans  no no it's it's west  all my life i've heard about barr  barrhaven and i  oh it's gross  no it's uh it's you you   cross baseline or knoxdale road and it's it's   like way out there  ohh   and uh he's been my doctor for twenty years and i just sort of  oh your medical doctor  ya  ohh   because i'm not perpetually ill or a hypochondriac then once a year traipsing out there hasn't been a real issue  uhm but it is in a way laugh cos it's just too damn far  it's nice to have a confident doctor  so   well ya  and so i'm gonna going to go  and and talk to him about uhm i don't know whatever prozac or whatever this they want to give me  any kind of la-la pills maybe two words   do you get a note from tom for that or  i don't think so  or does he call him or  well i'm i don't know  i'm gonna going to ya i'm gonna going to give him tom 's number and say you know you can confer with him if you want uhm but this is the scoop and i'd i think that this could be beneficial for a short term and you know i think it  it would be fine  my father thinks it'd be fine  everybody i talk to says ya go for it  just to sort of break the cycle because this whole depression  that i've been going through it's not a real depression depression   well i mean it is  it's just this constant word   i wouldn't want to see a worse one  no i guess not eh  uhm ya it's been going on for like four months  three or four months now   and   ya   it's situation caused though  it's not it's not something that  like if that situation hadn't've had not have  happened i don't think you would be where you are  yes   no but  which i don't know if that makes a difference or not  it's situation caused but it's always been under the surface  it's always there  it's always under the surface  it's not like it just happened as a result of one incident and then it'll go away and i'll be bright and perky   no there's a term for that   ya   uhm no i've been like this since i've been really little  and it turns out i've found out that when i was five and they took me the first time i ever saw a psychiatrist was when i was five and my parents took me because i was just right out of control apparently  i wouldn't word   and you didn't know this before  ya ya i knew   ohh   well i knew because i don't know i knew  but they put me on some kind of drugs for about a month to break the pattern and uhm so it's  word remember this   and this is what tom said  he said you should i think i'm looking  at something for you for a few months to help break this pattern uhm or break out of the pattern   well idealistically this is what prozac is for  it's not a lifestyle  ya   i mean people laugh   laugh well unless it gets really good   who knows   laugh   methadone forever  exactly  we'll just create an entire race of people and have mood-altering drugs  laugh   ya   well anyway whatever  so i'm i'm sort of looking forward to that  i'm going to go to the group thing uhm because i think what he wants to do is have it so that eventually i'm   you know i'm not going to do the one on one with him  oh are you   because anytime i've seen him we've done it for maybe six months or three months or you know and then not done it for a few years and then come back for a few months and then not done it for a few years  but this would be like a constant  and you come and you go and and you use it to touch base and it might just sort of be a way of monitoring myself in a way while i learn how to do certain things and  mhh hmm   and i have to do  oh and i have he said now you know he said i don't want you to get into a relationship laugh for a while  he said that  ya he said this would be a really foolish thing and i said ugh i am i have no energy for a relationship  oh but energy relationships   give you so much energy  i have no relationships   well exactly   i mean they're so fuelling  ya   ya i know but i have no energy  i have no time  i just the last thing i want to do is even   i mean word   well you're a fool if you don't use this period in your life to really set up a foundation for the next  yup   and this is like no "" a"" great opportunity  you've got tom   you've got possibly group  yup  you've got medication that's there   yeah   i don't know i think i think  that's a really good chance  ya i think it'll be good   ya i do too actually  i think it's quite positive   and then uh and then just sort of move on from there  ya  but what i have to do also is start thinking about what i'm going to do  because i'm i'm s becoming a little  i have to do something else so that   like life-wise activity-wise what  career-wise  career-wise  but something that incorporates what i've been doing  at the uh at the museum  ya   uhm and teaching isn isn't   look looking   teaching is all   it's funny when i was in high school and it was the okay well   now y you   now you   teacher or nurse   ya teacher or nurse what are you be when you grow up   uhm i wanted to either work in museums or uhh teach high school visual arts  ya  and get a you know i was gonna   going to go and do the b f a and do the whole thing  and that was originally what i was gonna going to  do until you know all hell broke loose and i didn't go  so i'm back at that point again where that's really those are the things i'd really like to do and i'm thinking well i'm doing the museum aspect of it which is incorporating teaching  ya   so maybe it wouldn't be i mean maybe i should just go and see if i could do a a b ed   and even if i were teaching part-time or supply teaching i've already proven that with the type of lifestyle i have doing a whole bunch of different jobs matters is fine   mhh hmm   like i could work some shifts at the restaurant i can work at the museum i could go and supply teach at a school i can you know hop  around   ya   well you're in a nice position in a lot of different ways  man   so i mean i just   well ya i have no kids i have no marital obligation i have no person that i hafta have to  sort of  no you have to feed yourself and clothe yourself   two words and that's it  ya essentially ya  so i can do whatever i want  they say that you know yourself in terms of capability and what you should with your life you know yourself better at fourteen  than any other  the theory is you announce at some point in your adolescence what you want to be and it's generally right on the target  oh ya you told me this before   ya   and depending on the reaction you get  i remember you said that   cos i'm sure i said i don't know  you rocket scientist   or whatever and i was told i was a damn fool  that's right   i wanna want to be a   ya and somebody giggled   ya  ya and apparently even the strength you have when you're an adolescent you'd say it again and again and and  you'd get whatever reaction but if not one person says okay well  let's look let's go meet a rocket scientist  or whatever it gets lost  mhh hmm   and i for the life of me cannot think of what i said but i'm sure i had something  sounds interesting  and when you just said you know i thought when i was in high school i would be a teacher visual arts teacher in high school  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  ya or ya probably   like what is what what   is that art history or is it actual   hands on   oh that's like art history   well ya it's it's  studio and art history and photography and history of photography and  you know helping you know essentially working with students to you know get them their well an o c   did you have a class like that in high school   ya when you do your o c as perhaps a reference to the ontario college of art and stuff you're helping them get their portfolio pulled together if they wanna want to go to art school or or go into the art field and you  you know they learn about architecture and design and stuff like that and they you know  but i had an art teacher that was completely ludicrous  she was like a right right  loony  mhh   we were doing uh popsicle sculptures in what was grade thirteen and i was trying to put together a portfolio for university and i'm going popsicle sculptures what the hell is this  that must have been quite weird   we did a lot of crafts and i just thought it was just really appalling so   but i i would i'd really like to  work with that age group  they're annoying but they're also really really neat  ya  uhm really neat  but you don't want to do anything therapy-wise  you don't want to do art therapy or learning disabled artwork or  well i don't know maybe   cos that's quite cool   painting for the blind laugh   laugh   blind photography  exactly  i don't know  no no  uhm   that sounds amazing  well maybe  i mean you never know because things things   lead to another thing and thin things    i'm just thinking cos teachers' college mainstream teachers' college is really well i don't mean to say anything negative at all but it's just not that easy to get into  and if you were to arm yourself with some type of  counsellor thing whatever but   no i know   i know  well i've got i've got  visual arts and and english so  i'd like to uh i'll just have to see what i can do  oh let's go to ottawa u  university next week then  ya  we'll go one morning   word go and find out what  i have to do  and i may have to do a whole year of upgrading before i can apply to teachers' college  and how many   and who knows i might have to go and  i might have to go to like some teachers' college out in boonieville "
Canada	" i don't know  lakehead  lakehead yeah   laugh that's where everybody's going  lakehead university   lakehead   ya laugh   i'll get a pair of mukluks a traditional innuit boot  and a lumber jacket  no i i mean i'd much  ra rather it would make infinite more sense  to to be able to go to ottawa u  university   uhm  i want ottawa u to start a midwifery program  oh ya  well they've been talking about it for three years  i'm in there  i'm takin taking it  i don't care if i'm fifty-six years old by the time i get in   well have you spoken laugh   have you spoken to anyone in the uhm at the school of the  mid midwives  uh mid midwives  uh uh   last year i did   midwi midwives   ontario college of midwives   ya  no   that was on my list of things to do  oh   well isn't there anywhere   ya  ah not lakehead but sudbury or  somewhere in texas you said  something weird like that   well that's an american program and this is where hermione 's friend eileen went down and lived  and and apprenticed and came back full-blown  super-midwife  right   uh is she working  ya ya   great   in fact she's got a clinic in toronto and she went down with her kids and  she went down with two kids and came back with three or something  hmm   laugh   but this is the big movement down there because of the  uh uh the closeness to the mexican border and they work with a lot of indigents and  oh okay   wow  well so anyway i've gotta got to  really sort it out because they're non e  there's this other dramatic ur  urge sort of yearning is to sort of ditch it all and uh go to theatre school   no way  laugh ya  which is the other thing i wanted to do way back when  i've always wanted to do that and yet i've been really sort of  afraid of it but uhm   so do it a little bit  well i know  and that's what i keep thinking just do it a little bit  do a little of this do a little of that  but i was thinking no if i was gonna going to   do it i'd just sell all my furniture and everything i have and try to go to rada royal academy of dramatic arts or something in  england   ya   like just hurl myself into it  well w   okay what what experience do you have in the theatre so far   uhm when i was in france i did theatre when i was at school   did you   ya ya it was like french language and theatre  and uh i had to do it like in french which was pretty fun  we did a couple of plays  and did you love love love it  i love love loved it  oh ya  that's what being working in a restaurant is  it's just being on stage   ya this is why i fuck laugh you know   it's being on stage  and that's why working at the museum is so easy  ya   like i have no problem just marching in and talking to a room full of people who are like i have to convince   well you are theatrical   ya   you know   uhm and what else did i do  i did a lot of stuff when i was a kid uhm   at ah at uhm   around the class   ya   at school   ya i did a lot of stuff around the school and uh   did they streamline you into like  like we had to take drama band or art  one or the other laugh   ya and i took drama and art   di   ya  oh okay   ya   cos i could only take drama  you couldn't take art  no  why not   oh no co no   you just you picked your you went into  secretarial vocational which was electrician  and uhm academic   oh christ   laugh hallsweepers   ya well i was in a would've been in an  academic stream  oh ya and then o once  you're in academic at the age of fifteen they ask you what i don't even no "" know"" discipline i suppose they'd call it you would go into  and there was no switching in between  there was certainly no combining of them  i know and that's really aw  awful   and hermione was in band   band  ya  hermione   ya   that's so weird  oh ya   what'd she play at   clarinet   clarinet and flute   oh my god you're kidding   second flute  she's very good on the clarinet  oh ya  ya  isn't that wild  i never knew she played an instrument  she could still pick it up and play  ya well but she wa  was this was band  that's so cool   this was this huge forty  you know you played your part   in the band   ya   what did you do   and i was in drama  drama  drama  laugh   i was the uhm i was the   cheshire cat  laugh   laugh i can't even remember the other stuff i was in   oh god  there's so many missed opportunities there though  because somebody nobody has ever and i always do this whining thing but if somebody had put a paintbrush in my hand  and acrylic paints in grade ten and said  cool laugh you know i would be in a whole different place right now  i know   ya exactly   yup  i mean it's pathetic that at thirty-two you pick up a paintbrush and say this feels great  laugh this is fun  ya  yup  no it is  it it all it's there's something not quite right about the way we educate kids and i'm not entirely sure what  you're supposed to do about it   but uhm i just uh y i w  i would really  i think you should look at what you wanna  want to produce and you should ask people who are really  sort of centred and and whole  people what  it is that got them there  mhh hmm   ya   cos it's not high school laugh   no it's not  it's not high school at all   laugh   high school is just the high school's this fallacy   and and ironically i had this long conversation with gary about tommy and said don't sweat high school on this kid  i said gary you of all the people after all your years teaching high school should know this what is   well six years and grade thirteen's gone so maybe if laugh tommy can  just hang on   wha what   exactly   if you hang in   what's he in   is he in twelve  ya no he's he's doing uhm uhh o a cs unfamiliar reference and uhh i think grade twelve at the same time  he's got half and halfs cos like he screws around a bit and doesn't always get his marks  so   so he hates it   oh ya school is just a big complete pain to him  he should and i said so finally he's   gary 's at the point now where he's really  uhm stressing or giving t  tommy options like canada world youth uhm going out into the world don't worry about university  fuller brush salesman   just   ya laugh well ya fuller brush salesman  laugh   just go out there  and i've spent like months talking to gary and saying  don't anticipate university for this kid  let him go  he he let him go and learn   don't let him sit in the house when he finishes school  and just like a bump on a log   ya  it's if you live here you work  if you don't wanna want to do that than you get out there and here are here's all  these opportunities  go dig water wells in the sub-sahara  well the killer is that gary has access to these programs  exactly   he's aware of them  absolutely   he can go and live on jacques cousteau's  boat  i know  he can do all that really neat stuff   exactly  and that's exactly what tommy needs   he needs to   well is he is he  legitimately bored   ya he's legitimately bored and he's  he's just a bit aimless  i mean he's had a couple a few years of real weirdness going on in his life   ya  and uh uh the whole situation between gary and i has thrown him once again as being once again in the middle of something   really   ya well what can you do to help him with that   he was here he is in the middle   well just  leave him alone  leave him alone and disassociate myself from his father  which is what i've done  which is what i word do   what's it like when you see him now  i haven't seen him since saturday  i didn't go i i   decided not to work on sunday obviously because he was gonna going to be there and i just felt he needed some space and i  needed some space   ya   ya well i was pulling you over the coals about that too   ya yup yup ya you were  uh so i'll i'll maybe see him on sunday  maybe not   well it do you think he's upset about it  do you think it's a pain in the butt for him  do you think  i think he's got just enough of his father in him that he's just tunnel-visioned  he doesn't worry about his mom and his father  he doesn't worry about me and his father  he's just   well he's a if he's a normal    like i'm trying to think how i would react at seventeen though  he's just living his own life   you don't c care   well he's eighteen   you don't really care about adults  like you don't your whole life   two words anymore   no but i mean he had   no he had stuff going with you  he related with you on things and  stuff but i don't think he had a dependency on you  oh ya   two words i know   i don't think i don't think you've threatened the security of his life  no no  no dependency   no no not at all  i don't   no  no of course not  uhm there's definitely a  no he knows that i'm always available to him   that uh that i wasn't just being his pal like his friend just because i was you know  cos you had to walk by him in the living room  ya  ya  but the you know i was more genuine than that  but what else does he have access to   phrase   not very many except for uhm uh one friend of theirs uhm  uh what's her name tori uh tori   this is an adult who's who has   known tommy all  her all his life   ya   oh ya oh ya   and he will often go over and uhm and talk to her  or if he is at their house then he'll uhm sort of find a way to separate himself from the kids and go he'll have a chat with her at times  oh well that's good  that's that's all   ya you get i  think in this  ya   ya   that's good  ya  so he has access to someone who is impartial that he can just sound off on  ya  ya  ya tori james that's it  i don't think   ohh   the james'   ya ryan james is uh gary' s lawyer  oh  ya  no i i don't think you ever walked into tommy 's house and said i'm gonna going to be your new mommy or anything  oh god no   i would i wouldn't  worry about any responsibility with tommy   a aside aside from you like him  no no no   ya   ya   i mean i i feel sorry  i mean i just feel shitty about the way things went but oh well   but   i don't know tommy 's got lots of other things like condoms to worry about  laugh and who stole his father's c d player  no   he w   ya gary bought a c d player and had it for about two weeks and tommy had a party and the   w week the week after like a few days after the party uh of course tommy can never remember to lock the door to the house a few days after  the word   tommy had a party laugh   he wasn't in on it was he  i don't think he was in on it  no i don't believe so  but uhm a few day not "" days""   and of course tommy never locks the door and all the rats in the neighbourhood know that like usually the door's open at branson  's "
Canada	 so uh while tommy was actually attending a class or  s you know reading magazines at a friend's  somebody came over and walked into the house walked to the c d player unhooked it very carefully and methodically and left  laugh   nothing else was touched  nothing  and you know nothing  so uh so then when gary came back and found that it was stolen and was like fairly pissed and said to  tommy well you know you've you had a party and it's obviously some friend of yours well then tommy  blew a gasket and said how dare you accuse my friends of stealing you c d player and they had a major   doi laugh laugh    ah well come on tommy   get with the program   ya   so they had a major scene about that   uh it was quite amusing  well in in reality  nobody has any proof  but i mean   so did they did they report it to the police and stuff  i'm not sure what he did  i would imagine  but he's not going to claim it on his insurance because  two fifty deductible   and   well exactly  and let's look at it this way uh tom two or two of tommy 's bikes have been stolen and one of  gary 's or three of tommy 's bikes have been stolen and  one of gary 's and uhm you know it's like one it's just an endless  situation so  ya   ya   that happened to us  within six months we had two bikes and a   what did they take when bobo got out   that was the the v c r and a c d player  huh ohh ya   and that's when rex had to sleep over and take care of  barry laugh   and then jan the next night cos he was afraid  well it was his birthday   where were you  georgian bay  ohh  i was up at the cottage with   ohh right  ya  ohh that was so funny   ya that was two years before randy died  oh was it  cos i phoned home to say happy birthday and he said   we're there was a break-in and bobo  's gone though  laugh   that was good news   and the officer offered to look for the cat and barry  said no that's okay laugh   laugh   look for the v c r  yes  nobody cares about the cat  and then the cat came back  that was tragic  ya  have you ever heard about that cat  no and i ask the sister about it and she's well i  dunno don't know   i mean all you have to do is look to the left when you go to the car  but anyway   well  well he was nineteen when we had him  was he that old  he was ancient  ohh  and the goal was just to have him you know die fairly comfortably and stuff when we got him  so i'm i'm sure he's belly up somewhere  laugh   he was a kind of cute cat in a weird way  ya  i wanna want a dog  ya i think you guys should get a dog  i would like to get violet for christmas  i know it's tacky to get a pet for christmas but i   oh it is  it's horrendous  is it  ya don't  get one in the spring  get a b get a puppy from a spring litter   that way you've got all summer to housebreak them  ya  house training in the winter is a bitch  and what happens too is once you get the puppy   see i knew this on a rational level   ya i know   ya   but once you get the puppy going  like housebroken so that he's going outside when there's snow in the spring often you have to break them all over again  because they will only pee on snow and they're  cos they're afraid of the grass   that's right  i could remember rory standing like on a tripod to pee on  a a two-inch square piece of snow under the tree in the shade because  she had this entire garden to use and she had to use this teeny little s little bit of snow   laugh   laugh   oh that's really funny  ya it is very funny  but it's also so much easier to do it   i know i know  but we've just put it off all summer  i should have gotten one in the spring  ya  well anna and roger are thinking of getting   a a puppy  all the puppies from the the fall litter well the summer litter were sold  when they went to vermont uhm the people they were staying with had uhm eleven chocolate lab puppies  this is what i want  this is what carol has  ya  ya  i really want a chocolate lab  ya they're great looking and they're cute and they're fun and they're labs and they're word   ya   and so anna had one and they all had wacky names  like one puppy was called bertha and  but they were just names to disinguish them  ya  and there was one that anna really really liked and she wanted to take it home and and they just decided that you know four-fifty was they just didn't have four-fifty to buy a puppy right now and they weren't gonna  going to wait and  i see   so there's gonna going to   be another litter in the spring  and anna has all the information on it   and then the   oh ya and she and the ma uh  like the father uhm the sire   and and the and the the  bitch are there and so she knows their temperaments and what they're like  maybe two words stuff   ?  see i don't really want a pure-bred but   and where is this   oh this is in vermont and they're having a litter in  april i think  and maybe anna 's gonna going to  get one of those  ya one of those puppies ya   and what about the marriage thing  nothing new  marriage  ya   who anna and roger   anna and roger   ya  so far no  ya   no  i think you know the funny thing is marriage is way down on her list of priorities  oh i thought this was   baby is the issue  ah   i'm getting the honey nut cheerios   flight time two minutes  down range distance nautical miles  altitude three nautical miles   cough   how much do you want   that's plenty

this briefly music starts: "" you oughta know"" by alanis morissette   i love this song actually   we're not supposed to put it on the stuff when we're doing this  uhm it never really said but uhm  ah probably can't hear that  it's in the background   partial phrase   she grew up in ottawa eh didn't she   ya   uh i word was she born here    i think so  i think she went to   i have her first album you know  i don't know where she went to  somewhere in the sort of east end  i have her first album  do you  the pop one  do you  used to play it all the time  did you   that was in my pop days before i became cultured and listened to gys gypsy music instead  oh i gave uhm maria my gypsy uhm music the uhm latcho drom  and she she actually had seen the movie  uhm she saw it in montreal though  uh huh   oh  and uhm she   she likes it though does she   ya she likes it  she uhm asked me if she could tape it so i said ya no problem cos i'm taping some of her stuff  that music will be passed around a lot  it's great because uhm she's so well rounded in her interests that uhm   like you know she has stuiff  like if i express an interest in something like cooking then often you know she may able give me tips or uhm  like she had that book that i wanted on uhm uhm uhm history   of print of print making  mhh hmm  which is so exciting eh   laugh   from gypsy music to the history of print making  this   what is this  this like early rockets or something   i guess laugh   well but they're  well it can't be because they're on a rope laugh   laugh   they pulling it up with a rope   it's kinda kind of  funny it's kind of funny watching it without   sound laugh eh   ya   i i love the bow ties  actually did i tell you like uhm when that fellow came in uhm  uhm to tell us about security and he was from the canadian security service  cough   which is really neat   c sis canadian security intelligence service   c sis ya   ya   and he laugh he's wearing this big bow tie  he was kind of funny a   you don't see bow ties too much  anymore   no  and he wasn't like that old  like sometimes you'll see them in in  really more elderly type of men  but this guy was maybe in in his  uhm late forties or early fifties  so it was kind of unusual  mhh hmm  is a play button supposed to be on when the record button's on  i guess so eh  uhm we're just supposed to press record  ya  that's all we did i guess eh   ya so  if we if we screwed up this after forty-five minutes then heads are gonna going to  roll 10 sec pause   oh this is uhm uhm when we shrunk the kids misstated title: honey i shrunk the kids   ya   what was it i said last night  raiders laugh of the the third kind laugh    laugh raiders of the first kind   that would be raiders of the lost ark  i loved that movie  that was the best 15 sec. pause   which raiders of the lost ark or close encounters of the third time or some sort of mutant hybrid of the two   laugh   both of them i loved actually  well i just loved it  and i still love uhm uhm close encounters just because it was so different  like even now it's kind of different  like uhm most alien movies from around that time i think you know aliens were sort of the bad guys and stuff like that  mhh hmm   and this one it sort of started out you thought they were bad guys but they weren't   mhh hmm   basketball that's so exciting   i uhh ya i liked it  uhm   i liked it a lot  it was a good movie  what was i gonna going to say  word raiders   oh i wish i wish we got t b s turner broadcasting system here cos they have good movies on some time   i know   my parents get

do exercises that make your neck bigger  uhm ya and i think those guys when   they they're tend to be sort of squat guys anyways  ya   and when they do uh bench presses and things it builds up their neck as well  it looks gross   i mean you sort of strain your neck anyways when   you're doing stuff like you're going like that   my dad used to play football  did he  mhh hmm 7 sec. pause   when he was at appleby   where  in appleby  well it was a private boys' school he went to for years  it's kind of funny because he'd always go when i was at appleby   laugh in the appleby days  well actually he was sent there  i don't know if i told you this uhm   both his parents died young but his mother died when he was just a teen  mhh hmm  and they knew his mother was dying and his mother uhm i think according to my mom arranged to send him away for the two years at school so she wouldn't see so he wouldn't see  her deteriorate number one  hmm  number two he'd get used to not having her around  maybe that was a good thing  so   ya so  and his dad died when he was fairly young too  i know i think bef i'm sure before   he married my mom  he had a heart attack  that's tough   they both they both   had heart problems  like i know uhm  who took care of him  my dad "

not my taste  i word   it's not comfortable  ya well it's leather that's why   ya it's like you get all sticky sitting in it  i know it's a gorgeous sofa and everything but   i'd love their blue one  i was hoping the'd give it to us  well all the kids use it downstairs   ahh that thing i could sleep in   ya  maybe two words my favourite sofa when we bought that living downtown  and your parents  your father didn't seem uhm distant tonight  do you know what i mean  ya he was a good sport  ya   i was surprised   cough cough   it went a little  i don't know if they were being polite cos they were at our house or something   like why  what do like what do you think   you know   how were they being polite  well just being nice you know   mhh hmm  word i think we genuinely had a nice time  ya  okay good   i i usually feel it you know  i don't even feel like tommy wanted to rush out and leave  you know  ya as i said usually when we go to his house he doesn't even talk to us 
Canada	 to him and i said so i realized that i was in that period of my life and whenever i need people i just have to  tell them that's what period i was in and just   mhh hmm  well it was really great to get that over with because  it's just closed something for me  and so another situation that i always think well one day i'm just  gonna going to do this i'm just  gonna going to just fess up and i'm just gonna going to do this is  one day i'm gonna going to have to say to  matt unless i've done it already but i don't think i did  but   i can remember one day i can remember exactly you know what my hair was like and what i was wearing and what  it it was actually this kind of weather outside and uh we were living on empress street  and i came home from a skating competition and i had just done very well  it was like jeunesse en forme or something like that   anyways it was skating and i was i think  my ego was big big big   and we were still like   he was still living at home so he must have been like   word   early sixteen or something  ya  cos he left something he was seventeen years old  ya  it broke your mother's heart  i know  laugh   and i we all know that  anyway so um it was saturday and uhm he was sitting in the corner reading the funnies and i whipped the funnies right out of his hand and sat dow down   no  he was sitting somewhere and i whipped the funnies right out of his hand and went and sat on the corner of the couch that wasn't upholstered yet and uhm   ya i whi i whipped the funnies right out of his hand i went and sat at the couch   and sat on the couch and i started reading them   and and of course he said give those back to me and we started having like a nattering argument and my mother said   and then my mother called him from the kitchen i think  like we had just come back from skating so naturally she was like back in her position cooking or doing something cos nobody had done anything while she was gone   and she tried to you know mother us from the kitchen and it didn't stop and we were having a real fight  we were i can remember because i  er enjoyed it because matt was so  nice usually to me  probably the first time you've seen them fighting in a long time word and you were happy   laugh   ya because   ya cos cos  usually he beat up on me when i was little but i mean this  time had past and now i was a bit more mature and he didn't do that any more and he was a hippie and i was a skater and we were very very different and   but we were having an argument and i was really enjoying it  and so i had the funnies and i was s   i was saying of course i have the funnies and he was going no i have the funnies and i was lying   and mommy came in and i told her that i had them  and i competed against him in a way to tell her that i'd had them  and she said let your sister have the funnies   and he did   isn't that awful   laugh   and i should apologize to him to get   if i could get that off my chest that would be like  probably the last thing that i feel guilty about  oh that's a standard sibling uh situation  isn't it? ya ya   but i can remember it so it must really bother me   you know one thing he always talks about  another one of those those family things is you guys playing monopoly   and he says sitting around and he says t j always used to talk about me being such a nice guy and everything and we'd sit down   and ya and  we you'd sit next to the family the family and start playing monopoly and he says t j  would get so mad at me  oh it's true   i know this story   because she says he's really not a nice guy  see look he's trying to get all the property and he won't let me have er anything and he's really not a nice guy  he's   he was competitive  ya ya  he says when it when it's money  his true self comes out  and he's he's really not a nice guy after all laugh   and that's the story he often tells that story  about bev is she thinks that i have really a mean streak underneath it because of the way i play monopoly   laugh   laugh because i think he cheated too  oh he does  he does  he cheats he cheats when he plays games  it's like when he plays scrabble  i remember playing scrabble a long time ago   but the gr and you know how   he he he uh when he uh describes things or he tells stories that aren't true or whatever to people uh w   w   if you know him you know that they're lies and it's a big gaff  it's funny right  it's word of the word    why would he do that though  cos it's funny he would could     like that's not what people do   no no cos it's funny  like everybody knows that it that that   that's happening  it's like when he does it to your father all the time   you know he tells these stories to your father or he  pre he pretends things to your father  uh and your father kinda kind of  falls for them and it's a big joke and everybody around the family  around the dinner table knows it and it's a big joke right?  oh   so i uh so he  he did that all the time  what was it  it was something that uhm uhm nope i forget gone  it was about the monopoly   nope i forget   oh i wanted to know   remember yesterday again we were talking about uhh in the washroom yesterday and uh and you were talking about that abusive relationship you were in   that guy that remember the   i think i met him just once or twice  where did you meet him  how did you get involved with him  oh i'm embarrassed to say it   well i i'm not embarrassed to say i'm embarrassed because he was younger than me and i i   mean did i fall for him because he was good looking  i mean i knew he was younger than me and he was good looking and he was so nice but he comes from a family where a whole bunch of members of his family are schizophrenic   and i and i think that he could  he could just like switch mood   well well i know obviously he could switch moods   so how i met him was i moved out from living with tom stewart   mhh hmm   and uhm and i left   i had like a show at wollock's in like a week   and i'd had the show   i had a show in peterborough in like a week and my work was finished and was just about to be transported and i had to do this show on the canal through saw gallery   and i just cou i just it was   time to leave  it was like i couldn't stop talking about it  i couldn't stop talking about it  so i i came home from cross country skiing one day and i said tonight after supper i'm leaving and i did and i went and i slept at a friend's house  and then i spent the and i had two hundred and like forty bucks in the bank   and i took my skates and a change of socks and a change of underwear and i walked up and down bank street looking for an apartment  it was awful  i felt lost  it was just terrible   and then this guy told me the same guy whose house i had slept at that night who's just like just totally like slept on his sofa  he to he told me that uhm  a guy he knew at uhm was  sharing a a place on len  on uh leonard street  kind of in ottawa south  and so i went to see it the next day   and the price was right and and uhm i would have my own room and we would share a kitchen  and it was like a s uh   and so that's how   so so paul was their cousin  and he came around   and uh i just met him because he came around but then it turns out that i met his sister and i met his mother and they were both artists and they were really really lovely people and  oh i see you were with people oh okay    ya  and i actually think that looking at these paintings that are in this room this woman brenda lewis i wonder if she would've been at the university of ottawa at the same time as his sister erin  was   but anyways his sister was just this totally flaille  uhm big eyes kind of zen been to india  lost an ovary at the age of sixteen metaphysical like   tr&egrave;s flaille   and i really en i really loved  his sister  like she was really neat  ya ya   and i thought wow he's related to her  he's gotta got to be okay  and he was younger than me and it's it was   like no no no you can't have a relationship with this younger guy  and it was just it was just a mess  and when i k   ya so when when i could see that  anyways i think i was smoking a lot of dope at the time  and i just and and i realized that like very early on it was abusive for a lot of things that he would say to me  but i i had really lost so much self-esteem because like already like my second marriage had failed  and  mhm   so when when you moved out of that house you moved out together with him  you moved out because you were gonna going to  start living together or   no no i didn't even know him  not at all   i moved away from tom stewart just because   it was awful and then we moved to wakefield   no no no but after two or three words  moved into this house   two words   oh uh he kept telling me he was gonna going to be a ski patroller out west and so   he kept looking for his own thing that i was gonna   going to do and i kept saying okay i can just hang in with him  until until he goes to do that and then i'll go do my own thing and then he just never went he just never went   and he also was doing like construction jobs and using my car and i rea i look back and i realize i was being totally used  no but how did you get out of that house to the house in wakefield together  oh oh okay um   this woman i knew who knew that i had s   split up with tom offered me her house for the summer cos her husband was an m p member of parliament and she was going back out west where he was an m p   and she offered me her house for the summer   oh okay   and he moved in with me except for i could have the house for free but he had to do something   ah okay  and he had to do s it turned out it it blew our friendship  he never did what he said he was gonna going to  do  it was awful   it was really   i gave her a drawing 
Canada	 a really beautiful drawing  and it was very hard on our friendship because well  she never did anything that she wou   i knew that in inwardly she was disappointed   mhm  clear throat so anyways by the end of that i kept thinking like he's not going he's not going yet  and i was just like trying to break up the relationship cos  i didn't wanna want to be i knew i had to but i didn't do it  this is really an awful period like i just   it was the most fucked up i've been   well it was just surprising y'know you know  to to hear all that because you're usually not someone that hangs around and puts up with   word you us you're usually mhm   oh no no it's made me a lot of what i am now   but nobody knew what was going on  nobody knows any of that  mommy i don't think wants to know it   dianne never had the time to hear it and   billy   hm   i don't think anybody has any idea  nobody i mean i i if i really sat down and thought about it to tell somebody what went on   it was it was probably   maybe i was like trying to live on the edge or something like that   anyways so then so then   they ca they were coming back you know   it was the end of the summer and he still hadn't gone  and so i wasn't really making my own plans cos i was tied up with this guy who you know and uh   and then it was so we had to move somewhere in september because they were coming back  and so we moved into we we took  we t we took like a downward move into like a group house around the glebe somewhere where a girlfriend of mine was that she was organizing it   and uhm i kept thinking okay like in two weeks he'll be gone  and i rented two i rented two rooms   i rented our room and a room for my studio and um  thanks oh that looks beautiful nice mug  boy we are having an art experience  ya you're right   that's it i hate my mugs  i'm going i'm getting new mugs  ya i want two or three words   i hate my mugs  me too  i also have to get new mugs and new wine glasses  and i'm looking for cheap new wine glasses that don't have really big portions in them laugh   why?   oh because then i go through too much wine  i feel like i need a cigarette   laugh   i feel like i'm in a caf&eacute; and i need a cigarette but i guess nobody smokes here eh  laugh   laugh   does anybody smoke here   no laugh   no laugh   it doesn't even smell like a  smoker's house   ya negative answer    okay so i just have to finish this story cos i want to cap it  so we moved into this house   and after a few months in this house uhm he finally got a he s he kept saying i'm going out west i'm going out west the snow is coming  like i could see and end coming   but he didn't he got a job at edelweiss   and i had always always always wanted to move to wakefield   so we moved to edelweiss and who do we rent from lorie horko   right right  and them uhm so that was like d   december one november maybe and the  november one maybe   so we lived there like september and october in that house so like all these moves it was just like move move move y'know  you know   anyways by m by february  he like threw me across the room and there happened to be this teeny little like shoebox apartment beside her apart  the apartment that we lived in and i moved out that afternoon and just left him  right mhm  it was a   so you've never heard from him again or  oh i once or twice just like made eye contact with him like somewhere at a crowded place and like just left and   he leaned over from the chairlift and whipped me on the leg with his ski pole and i had this bruise that went from like here around to my buttock this welt and bruise and   the morning the day i moved out he we   were having this like screaming fight right  like i never cry any more even when i'm arguing with jeff   we're having this like screaming fight and he   it was just after my birthday and he threw these mitts that he had given me and he i was cooking bacon he threw these mitts at me and they fell in the pan and the grease spattered all over and i started to like sob cry and   and anyways he was sitting away from me smoking a cigarette  and i i said aww pierre expresion and i like i was  s   it was so awful what was happening this v verbal fight that i i put i tried in a very loving way to put my hands down on his shoulders  and he goes stomping sound like he pushed back really hard and the chair flew back and he like pushed up like he like  e ejected off the floor   and he pushed up and he turned around and he picked me up by my shoulders and he and he just like threw me  and i felt like this figure in a chagall painting   just like going sideways across the room   ya laugh   so anyways i moved out this afternoon  god it makes me like inhale exhale   eew ya   got any stories like that  two or three words  laugh n no no i don't have those kind of stories at all   isn't it awful and you know what like  i can't believe like my sister doesn't even know this   i mean like people have heard like he picked me up and he like threw me across the room but like nobody   ya   for a distinct period in your life i remember him coming to bill and dar 's house in laval and uh for for one fam  ya for one family function he seemed like a a very nice guy    my life was so f  ya   and couldn't he couldn't he be charming ya   y'know you know like we have one set of family function pictures with this odd guy in it that  we don't really know   ya   we don't know much about him or you or  with him or whatever   ya   but uh   we really had a lot in common  i mean he really enjoyed he was very  creative and i got really s sucked into this family being creative and we both skiied and and um we had wonderful conversations and we would read together even though he   was y'know you know just had  a high school education  i mean it was just   but we but i   there was schizophrenia in the family   i can't actually even remember what happened then because   i know we were living in another apartment on dalhousie  pronounced dal-who-sie too  it was awful  and then his brother came to live with us when we were living on dalhousie  now where did the dalhousie apartment get in there   i don't know  i'd have to actually like look at a calendar   i'd i'd have i'd have to look at a date book and sort of figure like there were like five moves in a year there   it was really  does everybody in ottawa call dalhousie   pronounced dal-how's-ie dalhousie  pronounced dal-who-sie   i don't know what did i call it  laugh   dalhousie dal-who-sie   i've never heard it called dalhousie  dal-who-sie until i was moved to  ottawa.  dalhousie dalhousie dal-how's-ie   i call it dalhou  dalhousie dalhousie dalhousie dal-who-sie   because it's dalhousie dal-how's-ie  dalhousie dal-how's-ie university   oh uh i i call it both  you call it both  yep   oh i remember now   earlier matt monopoly   okay the other thing was scrabble   oh but he cheats   and but uh that's it exactly he cheats  but uh one one day we were playing scrabble with a group of people and he came up with this word  y'know you know   he had a zed  wanted to use a zed  got all these kajillion points and wanted to use all his letters and he came up with a word and put on the board this word called zwililogy right  and matt is so credible and so kind and everybody thinks he's such a nice guy and right   so he ended up putting this word down and nobody wanted to seriously challenge him on it right  so that mm  they didn't want to give up their turn   so they said matt what's  zwiliogy   and he says oh it's a baby sperm whale   and everybody went oh okay and accepted it  but that's the kind of stuff he does   and he does that to your dad all the time   he sucks him in like crazy all the time   so laugh anyway while driving up to nils '  and betty 's house one day he told them that he had to   walk out for er watch out for the moose  because uhm the moose would stand in front of the cars and   and   what moose   well exactly what moose   matt told nils   he told your father going up to  betty and nils ' house  they were driving up to their house all these stories about moose and everybody is laughing their heads off and he's sitting there like literally looking for the moose and afraid all this stuff is gonna going to happen but it has nothing to do at all with what would normally happen up there and he should know better you know but matt convinced him   oh   but that's he does that all the time  it's lo it's not really   but they do have bears betty and nils  '   ya ya ya ya ya  well that's true   we had some  i'm just looking at your mug   ya but we didn't have them like close to our house the bears  well ya keith and naomi   there were this well this uh this spring  anyway this fall rather there was  there was a bear on the loop   no  n ya  ya keith was out on his canoe  oh i just think he's an urban slicker and freaked out  it's probably a rock or something  i think he's i don't think they're very   no no no no   remember when they first moved in you said they were   outdoorsy   they do run a they do  they run outboard bound programs   keith is very in shape   uh  they do they do and uh uh   well then how come they're so freaked out about skidding on the road and they don't and they like   putting your backs up against getting winter tires  i mean they seem so urban  well they are they've lived in toronto all their lives  i mean they've live in toronto but they you know do a lot of outdoorsy things anyway   three or four words very   i know but people don't justhave like that kind of   equipment for looks  it's because it's like that hard and it's that tough and it's that slippery you know what i mean  and it's like they didn't really seem to wanna   want to get winter tires right   oh no they they  ended up getting them  but by the same token i mean when they when they go on their trips they basically go to some place park the car at some lodge and take off on foot  it's not like they're driving any place you know  like they're they're really on-foot excursions   so uhm but uh it's a same it's the same  as me  i've never had winter tires on my car before i moved up here   y'know you know   i have a four wheel drive and uh it was fine  even last even last winter with uh  the regular tires the regular all season tires it would go up the hill fine  but for some reason there was a problem this year  they're not freaked out by it  they're concerned by it and obviously there's   
Canada	 uhm i got the impression like they didn't  wanna want to get   the i ge i go i get   the impression from her maybe it's because she's pregnant but i  i pick up this vibe from her that she's  she has a a fear like oh it's gonna going to be a really long hard winter idea  is that strange like i just  no   no i don't get that feeling from her at all  i think ya   from him too like you know like   no i didn't get that feeling at all i think it was more in terms of is it necessary   are you being overboard in saying that we really need this stuff y'know you know   and uh that's the impression i got from her cos i   when i originally spoke to her about it she goes oh well oh well and y'know you know   we've never really had this problem before and oh f  for last year it was fine  uh maybe you're being a little overboard and  y'know you know and   god   so y you know they uh they eventually she's got her winter tires now and she's having no problem now but that that  first week was pretty bad period for all of us you know i mean  mhm   and she is pregnant and she has a forty  month old baby and you know it's not a time  it's not a time for her to to  get stuck y'know you know  so   oh i know i know   i know i know   but she did get them finally  i don't know i just picked up this   they got em them ya  but i mean it wasn't like to save money or anything   clear throat just   ya   was it  well i four or five words no i think money is part of it you know  no i can't imagine   is it necessary  is this gonna going to happen twice the winter for us to justify buying this  i think money is part of it   mhm   ya they seem to be quite uh not not   uh cheap but you know conscious of how they're spending their money  thrifty  ya   and uh i have no idea  well the house is only about a thousand f   oh well never mind but laugh   ya laugh   i mean the house is kinda kind of  big for them  ya   for the two of them you mean  ya  well they're gonna going to have two kids  they'll have they have uh  zachary   they yes yes it's zachary   zachary's not his name  samuel   the the baby now and then  the uh the baby baby's gonna going to  come   so that's four in the house that's   and they have their office  it seems so immense that house   it's cos   no it's not any larger than your house  they have downstairs they have a   uhm a g well finished well down   finished   that richard p turned it into a spare bedroom  just before they left to sell the house now that's what he uses as his office   mhm   now the rest of it downstairs not really finished  there's the entrance way that sort of has a subfloor on it  there's two bedrooms   two finished bedrooms   and on the main level there's like a you know like you have  it's almost like a double living room   you know you have like  although yours is more together it's  le theirs is less of the open concept  ya   changing the subject  what do you think of this   this is what i would do if i didn't have to worry about money  but i've be no but i've been really  thinking about it three or four words   laugh you want my wish list laugh   no no but i've really been thinking about it   in terms of uhm in terms of uh keeping the heat in the house and tur and and making  a tax deductible space out of the sunroom  okay  you know in between the living room and the sunroom  i was thinking about putting in   uh you know how when this house say was an original there would have been french doors  ya  and in between the glass sometimes instead of having wood in between the glass i saw these incredible doors they're new but they go great in a heritage house they have just like little pieces of brass  little strips of brass it's a really nice wood frame  ya ya ya   ya  and then it's partitioned glass   and you can get those that don't have door   well like when you first buy a door it doesn't have a hole for the door knob right  mhm   so you could get the panels to close it in and then have like a section where two doors open  mhm right   so all the light would come through  ya  and then i was thinking because it's because i would like to do dirtier work in my studio and i would like to have a drawing room and an office in the sunroom  oh that'd be word   ya   and i figure   you could you could  get uhm those louvre doors the pocket doors   you're gonna going to get those panels the way they are right  you could have the whole the whole  wall that's just the panels with the glass and then you'd just open into the pockets   so it would stay lit  well i   y'know you know it would stay lit  well there are no pockets cos it's a log house  three or four words retract   where would you where would they go  when they retract   well you put the there are   rails that you put up  there are rails that you put up   oh so they just overlap  ya sort of  ya ya  ya so  like you know where the aquarium is  that would be like permanently sealed off  ya mhm  and where those two little side things are that would be like a permanent piece  ya  and then the other part could like slide right back  stretch back into it ya  that'd be neat one or two words   cos that's the front of the house and   well it just was it was just that when i was working last fall like i kept i couldn't  draw in my studio and work in my studio telephone rings   mhm  anyways i think brian thinks that's just a disgusting idea and that we still need a word playroom for cory word but it's like doesn't mean  cory can't play in there it just means that   because i don't like to heat up my studio when i have to draw in the winter and i thought that it would make my workspace more part of the house space   ya   and i   plus you could just have it as a just a  separate place period in the house and it would   cos the open concept with those rooms   and then when we had company   it sounds it sounds  like it's really bugging you right now the open concept stuff  oh ya   you talk about it a lot   so that would break it up  but y again if you have people that are having company it could act more like a spare bedroom and  except for if you had a party which  i mean how often do you have a party  it people could still be in there and  y'know you know or   i like you know there's one thing about our our h beep from an answering machine round house our multigon house   i'm not crazy about  i really as a as a living style i like to have more uh private confined spaces   oh i know i know completely  i'd like to have a house that has like  completely i it's   y'know you know   ya   i really uh that's one thing i regret  about that house  it's like you all have to be together all the time  ya  but even still that'd be fine if you have that  it's like you have to be or you'd have to be  a little bit richer laugh have a little more opulence around and have the uh another section built  uhm so that there's there's more like  casual reading   just just quie   i love it the small little rooms  i love small little rooms where  little y'know you know you can go off and one or two words   i know why do we like small why do you like a small room when you wanted a big open space  well myself i had no choice   well the word   i just moved into it  ya  well i wanted both cos i like the big open space   so there was a it was a choice when we first started to design the house   i didn't really want uh that open concept   but as the nature of the house you you   kinda kind of have to do it  if you close it off you blow that the  effect that upper effect of of all the light and all the space and the openness y'know you know    so unless you have enough money to get a really big version and then leave thi that half of the house as like a semicircle and really open and everything  you you don't really have a choice  mhm   but that's one thing i regret  i like having more like little alcoves and  and those types of things but   mhm   anyway but you can do that  that'd be good  like like coralee's place   yes  that that separate little room where you can go  ya ya   it's it's really civilized   it's good to be able to go and do that   ya ya   actually i was thinking like right now i was thinking that the computer could be in there   and that when cory came home from school or had friends like   ya   i would call it my drawing room  i would i would like to like  pull out the carpeting and put in a good wood floor  mhm ya  and uh   see if he stays into music   you can also turn it into a a little music room   ya  a conservatory   and if you had the computer set up in there you can eventually put in synthesizers words   no i just don't think see   why everything has to always s stay the same   synthesizers  laugh   well he likes keyboards already  do you think so  ya  ya that's that's definitely a  uh a stimulation for him  it motivates him during the lessons if he can go to the piano  it's definitely a whole other concept for him   like there's the singing and the drumming and all that stuff  mhm   but he's much more tuned in to it if he  y'know you know relates it to the piano  and understands a scale now  mhm  dfinitely understands a scale  and uh it's neat because a keyboard is very uhm uh  open  it's very receptive  you can see you can see  everything   it's a little bit much to lug around  it isn't like a tin flute   well no in a in a  synthesizer version no one has real  laugh   well in hotels or whatever they have real pianos but unless you're very very very very up there in the music scene you don't   you don't travel with a piano  you travel with uhm uh a synthesizer and an electric piano  you know you travel with keyboards but you don't travel with the actual big huge pianos   you know unless you happen to be a millionaire   but uh but those types of things  cos they they they there are programs now where you can write music and it plays it can play  the music you write directly from your computer onto your synthesizer   and would you think he's that  so   well of course you would   no no not now of course no   now he's not   no like   but i mean i i can't imagine i can't imagine   like i would like to put him in some kind of music lessons cos i think it's a real discipline  ya  uhm so that's why i started   but not at this age  you can't think of music as a  i mean if you grow up one or two words    next year he'll be eight   eight is old enough for for piano lessons isn't it 
Canada	 for piano lessons  but you don't wanna want to look at if you wanna want to way to  turn kids off completely to music so that they y'know you know they're they're badgered into taking  unless they have the natural talents and they're there at three years old and playing like crazy already you know  mhm   but they don't uh they really don't  stay in music for a long period of time if you  if you put them in i found anyway in into   the real structured programs  any of the kids have that have gone on uhm are in with teachers that motivate them  that's mostly at that age   y'know you know a little later ya you have to get into the very structured programs  mhh hmmm   mhh hmm   but uh at that that age they just have to be with someone who'll make them have fun y'know you know   well i'd be interested in that  i'd like to see what he could do with that  uh and did you uhm   but i just i just   anyways back to that room  i just see that room like   i see it there and i'm i really want it  it it it isn't contributing to the energy of the house i   it it to me it's sort of like a dead space  and in the summer it's just like the newspaper room  well give me a break i mean it seems to me that it j  it every other space in the house seems so much more contributing to y'know you know what goes on in the domain  and the house just seems like lost space and  ya   ya  i think it i think it should be  y'know you know   well that'd be a good idea   and when you weren't using it you wouldn't be heating it  because it sucks up so much heat anyways because of the bricks and  ya ya a lot of the cold ya comes in from the bottom too  there's nothing heated underneath   well less now because we have  the door to the shed but   less   so let's mention that some time  to brian   no just throw it out in throw it out into the dinner conversation when he's had a few beers and   laugh   and uhm  ya i was thinking we have to have we have to have uhm  isn't this perfect  a cat art a sculpture on the table and tea  mhm   uhm we have to have dinner sometime  i'm feeling  like today i went grocery shopping and i thought gasp this is a new me like uh  you bought gro you bought groceries laugh   i actually no i ya and i bought like more than  like spread and stuff like that right like  i bought i thought okay i'm gonna going to make this sauce  with this and then when this is left over i'm gonna  going to use it with that and   mhm two words     i bought those slivered almonds   you planned you planned   ya  so that when like   you food planned   well i imagined more like   but laugh i was c more conceptual fea  laugh   ya   any i haven't heard any news from anybody of what's happening at christmas time  have you heard from dianne or no   two or three words   dianne said she might be coming down and she'd just let us know w when  she decides what she's doing  but what if they decide they wanna want to   come down for new year's cos they've heard of these great new year's and now you're the only one going to that party  laugh well that's uhm i uh   then i'll have to host everybody   exactly   oh dear it won't be the same  word   cos uh apparently uhm matt said bill  and val may wanna want to come down at new year's as well   laugh   and that would cause another problem  but matt is  you know matt he's of the oh they're  they're our family they can come  no you can't do that   laugh   so and matt would ask first  but uh that's that's kind of his  his thinking   unless you went there for the afternoon   ya  and then we went out to dinner or had dinner at my house or something like that  ya  which i could do and laugh   mhm   i really could  i really could  i could do it by now  i feel ready again   uhm and then we could just all meet out somewhere later  or are are you supposed to stay where you're going  like if you're going there in the afternoon that's an awful long stay to s to go there in the afternoon and stay there till one  mhm  that's a long time to be with people that you don't really know that well  ya  well that's what i thought anyways when you told me you were doing it   ya  they said it was gonna going to   start around two and we'd have potluck dinner and blah blah blah but   but just generally speaking uh christmas christmas   uh i don't know word what he's  doing  i in between   i haven't t emailed   my sister nobody  well we have to have one family dinner at our house with all  brian's family so you guys can come to that which you probably will really like which matt will probably really like   they're coming down this year  well i invited them to come down because brian's  sisters are great fans of my work and there's that show at city hall and   if they don't if they don't come here then we go there and it's y'know you know     brian says i'm imagining it but it's just so christian  i just want like everybody to come here and just have it be like neutral in the forest y'know you know   and the they they want to come   they say they like to come the day after christmas   like a boxing day thing  mhh hmm  so then we exchange some gifts and it's really great for the kids cos they play   but i wou what i wanted to do  but i but i don't know yet if the gallery is open at city hall   so what i wanted to do   i mean i don't want them to come the day after christmas but  that's when they want to come  but i would rather it was a like another  day later   ya   or but in between christmas and new year's i asked them to come down  so he has two sisters  between them they have one two three five kids   and then he has a brother who has two kids but they're uhm more like kevin's age  one just went to cegep collège d'enseignement général et professionnel this year  mhh hmm  and there's his dau daughter   kristi she   imagine cory in like a beautiful beautiful  fifteen year old girl  so there's this girl like that kristi   i mean she looks  redhead  total total  she looks just like cory because her mother  is a redhead as well   but they're divorced so   you wouldn't believe brian's brother   looks like a burned out bureaucrat no hair   really eh  totally different physique  totally totally different   huh   apparently i don't know how deep the conversation got but apparently uh brian was talking about his dad's death yesterday with  matt   and uhm uh  cos w just out of the clear blue  matt said last night hey did you know that brian's dad was only sixty years old when he died one or two words    well we'd just been talking about that recently  ah okay  ya   personally i think he needs to process a lot of wholes  a whole lot of stuff about his family  not bad stuff but just uh   there's a lot of   sigh he was the oldest son and he worked the hardest and  his brother's brother has got stuff   his brother got stuff and his father died  and he didn't go a lot when his father was ill  and his sisters kept saying you should come to the hospital now but he couldn't stand going cos they he  had this all these tubes stuck in him and everything and  mhh hmm   ya  so then he died and he wasn't there when he died  oh that's it   we were just talking about something the other day and he said uhm   oh we were watching something on t v and i said is that what they did with your father  like they theyx had to pull the plug like they had to all make the decision   and that actually   i mean i guess i knew it was happening at the time but i was just more like concerned with the way brian was reacting and i wasn't   y'know you know it was a   sort of like a second layer right  like we weren't in toronto we were here  mhh hmm  and brian was asked to go and he did go for a couple days and just basically like visited his mom and sat and looked at his dad with all these things going in him and the machine making him breathe and  he brian couldn't s  he just can't can't handle that  ya   uhm so we just we talked about that   so that only like two days ago   we didn't talk about much  it was very casual it's like while we're like doing the dishes or something it's not  mhm   ya i was wondering if it isn't some kind of crisis  coming or something  it's not even like this   if he'd uh y'know you know  just recently been thinking about it  if there was something  cos if he it's not not it's not that   it's not bad news that he talked about it   no but it's not the type of stuff that he normally talks to  matt about  i guess maybe they haven't been alone and having a conversation along those three or four words   i know i'm always on his case to have a friend  ya  y'know you know so maybe he's   how did it come up   i have no idea  i didn't get really get a chance to talk to matt about it  just out of the clear blue he just   brian mentioned his dad and said that he died at sixty isn't that bizarre and he started to tell me a little bit about how he died  cos i didn't realize that he had died when he went in for  uh his oper you know a lung operation   ya   he had the lung transplant  ya   see i didn't realize that  i thought he had died just from severe asthma  no clear throat   and uh so   totally fit eh   his lungs were totally fucked but this  man was like totally fit  ya   ya   like they told him  ya   well this is it and i this is what i   say to brian on a regular basis  are you gonna going to be like your dad like the doctor tells you   five years y'know you know   like he knew for years that his lungs were going right  and the doctors had told himstop farming   mhm   y'know you know stop farming  they had a bed and breakfast  they had  y'know you know   he kept farming y'know you know up until like   oh on christmas we went there when i first started living with him   and he went in he went in and he  hooked up all the c the uhm the horses   these belgian workhorses and uhm he took us for a ride around the farm on the sleigh   i mean it was a great picture  mhm   but i mean he was sick for like days after that because  just hooking up heavy breaths   ya   and i and i see brian  like that now y'know you know   not not breathing but in another sense his body   his body itself ya ya ya  well i mean   ya yea doing it doing it doing it   and so i don't mean to turn the conversation to myself but i mean can you imagine living with a person who's like hard on themselves  and you don't wanna want to be angry at the person  mhm   ya  and you don't wanna want to be trying to control the person 
Canada	 so you have to find a place in yourself that just says they're doing what they're doing like ugh  ya  even billy's talking about it  ya  that's really funny because yesterday when we were  walking around the gallery i started to think about okay  brian's dad died when he was sixty   yesterday afternoon i was walking around the gallery and i was thinking about okay so brian's forty two so that would give  eight years  eight years  and i started freaking out  oh no eighteen years  and then i thought like  it it's like if he's gonna  going to live that way and he's gonna  going to stress himself that way and   he reads all these things about heart disease and stuff but he still does all the stuff right it's like i'm not   y'know you know   laugh   so now my only concern is that he's old he's   he's uh alive long enough for cory like   if there isn't anything else going on in his life that he figures is worth taking care of himself for well y'know  you know   well what a crisis too eh  when uh you realize how close you are to the age of uh  y'know you know your father dying  oh   it seems that is that the natural uh  y'know you know death time for your family  ya   mhh hmm  uhm   margaret and jim they're going through something now  mhh mmm   he's just turned fifty   just last month he had his fiftieth uh birthday   now his dad died when he was tommy's age   so they're basically living with   oh when he was word sick  ya sorry ya ya   three or four words  laugh   sorry   laugh   hm no he wasn't seventeen sixteen when he died  but uh they're really afraid now that jim's  gonna going to die   and it's a constant worry for my sister   oh so that's why she wanted to your place for a vacation  ya ya   so she's always worried about that but y  you think about it and uh   she's a worry wort eh  she very much of a worry wort ya   exhale   but the other thing that is also v   for me very shocking to think y i uh seniors right  seniors are start getting classified as seniors as at fifty   fifty plus clubs   and it's like ahhhhh  that's really soon   a senior  we're we're we're starting to edge into that senior's category   i don't call it that  i just call it croneward bound   laugh   i mean i y'know you know   like i love that whole concept of the crone  laugh   which really pisses me off that they don't have a word for it in french  i mean can you believe that we live in a soc   we live in a society that doesn't have a word for  for wise woman like for crone  i mean it's such a wonderful concept  mhh hmm   ya  and uh i i think that that's where we're going us  but there's this   well   i can't consider men  i think they're so underdeveloped anyways  they all stop at fifteen anyways so  well there's the intellectual side of it but there's a physical side of it  but   i mean once you once you reach your mid forties uh your body starts falling apart  there's no two ways about it   y'know you know you can do what you what you can to keep it together and some of us not me are more a apt at it than   others but   laugh   but uh y'know you know   y you can't you can't help it  and especially women because you go through a specific menopause  that changes your your physical body and your mind might be functioning fine or you may still be growing there but your body is stopping you from doing things and it's  it's very hard to keep on top of things  mhh hmm   but use your body   but you better do everything you can with your mind because you've had forty years to get it together to not be bitter  and to be able to age with not grace how you look from the outside but to have this inner kind of place you really are happy to be  it's not a matter of being bitter  it's a matter of being frustrated because your mind is going some place   right well whatever   a and your body can't do it   well is your mind gonna going to   go some place   for sure  i would think so  well not at fifty   no go no go go   some place good i don't mean go some place bad  i don't mean deteriorate  mhm   i mean that you're still learning  you're still y'know you know   oh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   i still wanna want to go to school  i still wanna want to learn  i still wanna want to do things  y'know you know   but your min your your body   uh stops you  it either stops you in terms of the amount of energy that you have to expe expend or   i it becomes difficult   mhh hmm   and uhm just that reality watching uh  y'know you know either my family or brian  talking about his his dad dying at sixty  well that's not so far off anymore eh it's just  two words ya   eighteen years   ya   eighteen years is a very long time   is it   it's not to me  i mean having a having a son who's uh  turning seventeen that went through like the blink of an eye   it's like buzzap it's gone   it seems like yesterday he was   no but you work like how many years   thirteen years at the cit now  thirteen years at the city of montreal   that wasn't the blink of an eye   ya   well it was and it wasn't  i mean the last couple of years were i guess uh longer  laugh than the others just because of the drudgery but one   when you're in the middle of it when you're stimulated by it when you're having a good time as it was in the beginning  it went by very quickly y'know you know   mhh hmm   but it's just laterwhen things become a dirge that   it uh they extend longer than they seem to   mhh but   well i think point of view really has a lot to do with how you handle that and how you and what kind of energy you put into every decision you make daily   ya   because you're building  i mean at this point we're supposed to we are  old enough and we have it figured out enough that you're building on top of something and   your ju you your  decisions that you make fold fold in on themselves and create your reality right  so like every decision you make like   sure   ya for sure  but your cons but your  conscious decisions are are diminished a lot when you're uh in a very heavy working situation because you're just going with the momentum  in various relationships   ya  and even though y'know you know   when you stop when you consciously stop and try and decide what you're  gonna going to do well you can make an effort to get from point a to point b but normally just the momentum of life just throws you along and you really can't do too much about it  you just have to keep going y'know you know     and uh that's uh uh that's for me like this s  sixteen years has just flown by  so to see and it seems as i'm getting older the years go by quicker   and uhm i think it just seems that sixty's  gonna going to come really quickly y'know  you know   so are you concerned about money  oh for sure  for sure because neither matt nor i have any kind of uh stable uh savings or pension or whatever  we we've made this investment in a home late in life   y'know you know mortgages real estate all that kind of stuff  that's all new to us  we're we're investing much later than  most people most families do   so we're starting at an age we're investing at an age in those kinds of things when we we  should really be seriously investing in money to live on  mhh hmm  because we don't have pensions  we don't have uh any kind of job y'know  you know both being in g i  i jobs that are uh uh self-employed by nature that y'know you know   you just you can't do much about it   but you could do them forever like unless your hands become terribly arthritic or something like that and bill's  hands   mhh hmm   ya well definitely y'know you know  definitely   but uh but still there's still   i it takes you a long time to accumulate  so   and ah let's face it at some point he's gonna  going to wanna want to slow down too  he's teaching  he's teaching a lot now but at some point he's gonna   going to wanna want to   want to do other things that are more stimulating  i mean he wants to play but he doesn't get y'know  you know he just can't stop  like he's he's caught up in the   mome momentum right now   mhm mhm   he has to keep doing what he's doing   and he's aged a lot in the last   have you noticed how much he's aged in the last year   no  oh phenomenal   it's phenomenal how much he's aged   no i honestly haven't and i mean i do look at him because everybody's always telling me how gorgeous he his and it's like i look at him two words like   one or two words   laugh   no to me he still looks as he still looks like when he was eighteen  uh well he his he still looks very young but the to me it's shocking   from when we st   uh y'know you know obviously the pressure of the house all the stuff everything uh even turning forty five at the same time whatever he he's aged an awful lot   his uh his skin his hair his eyes  the glu y'know you know the  glu the kind of film   not it's not a film but they're not as bright as they were  oh ya   laugh get out the sunglasses  laugh   oh ya  he's aged a lot   oh fuck laugh   and as a lot of uh  well i'll look him over next time  one or two words </unclear   well i don't look at him like that cos i don't  y'know you know he's only my brother i mean   word   you know what i mean  like i really   laugh   billy i see it in because bill  keeps getting like fat  ya one or two words your brother    ya  and his face  he keeps getting like   ya  and like he and valerie like they change so much like every time i see them it's like stress dinner parties   y'know you know  diet  ya they're on   ya   i mean it's like   you know like  ya they're really caught up in a social whirlwind eh the  two of them  ya   no it's just because i've seen them look so different  i mean they haven't always looked one way y'know  you know like bri's brother   he uhm   he always was this kind of build so i just figured well  they they kin they have different genes or something   but i never assumed he was ever the other way  but he used to be just like bri so   oh ya  ya  but i mean to see billy look so different and then look so different  and valerie she just like changes all the time plus  half the time she says she really needs to diet and she looks fine  ya  like   no she's on a major dieting kick again now  weight watchers  that's> not good for you though too much   to diet </[  laugh no i know   no of course  you you end up uh uh  diet too often you don't end up losing weight anymore  it's like this pattern sets up so that to lose weight again becomes very difficult 
Canada	 well anyways that's what i was thinking about   about matt   maybe uh maybe he's just like due to slow down and and some metabolism thing is  changing him   if he just had more sleep he wouldn't have that glaze in his eyes and his   no but his skin  his his sk he's gotten very grey over the last year   very grey   mhh hmm  and he's got sandy coloured hair so it is   it isn't as drastic   no but it goes quick   like i remember my father  well i don't know if he'll go grey like daddy eh  he might go grey like mommy's brother   no he would be going bald then   two or three words   no he must be fournier cos he has all that hair  ya   well no i don't know who the  granger 's  remember   i don't know your other side of the family so  the men are bald and uhm   bald and   like more like mommy y'know you know   mhh hmm   so he must be like a fournier then because he's got such thick hair   as he's getting older it's ge  becoming much thinner   y'know you know   me i was gonna going to say i remember my father's hair turning grey  i mean i can remember as a young girl like say that like just grey here in this picture  and then i can remember like it was like sort of grey   and brow and black   and then it was   and then it   oops it's white   and i but i but i can remember the grey thing happening very quickly   so now i'm i know it's going to just happen laugh very quickly   laugh   so that's why it's probably happening so quickly on him  ya maybe  it's started  ya genetics   laugh   genetics here we go   oh ya genetically there's a lot of   like my dad   my dad was the oldest one to survive in his family  all his other s siblings  died at around fifty   he was the only one that managed to   oh and the one the one auntie that left me money last year laugh who died a couple of years ago  but all the others died very early   heart disease really really early forties fifties   ya  ya but they probably ate completely different than the way that you eat though   i have no idea  i didn't know them very well   so it would really freak you out if something happened to your sister then because   physically if something happened to your sister cos you would  thi   uh uh no not really because i think uh her personal  uh medical problems or whatever are are a lot to do with her own headspace ya  headspace   very much so  so   she worries so much it's beyond ridiculous  i mean uh uh i it's good   you know in the b in the beginning when they first came to when they were building our house i thought oh it's just like  she can't handle the construction site   or she doesn't believe that you're really gonna  going to be able to do it or something  but then other times she's come and like obviously everything's together y'know you know and she arrives on the scene and she's still carrying that kind of like inhale  like   ya   don't worry y'know you know you're not  gonna going to fall off any two by fours  like they're all put away now y'know you know  like  ya ya  no she's because she   worries about absolutely everything and to the extreme   and i'm i've still noticed it    so if anything if anything  makes her ill that's gonna going to be it   i mean there may be some hereditary y'know you know problems as well for sure but uh i'm sure that   she'll she'll edge them along very quickly by  her mindspace but  mhh hmm mhh hmm   well then i think that what we should do for christmas  circling back to that is that it should be a very laid back lack of pomp type of thing  mhh hmm  y'know you know   that'd be nice   i mean christmas since i've been living with  brian because of the business and everything it's like recovery time  and the first few years we tried to go up tape cuts out   it's like oh hi and then he's off  to go do something  ya   ya   i enjoyed the kids tonight   about three words when we're at his  house he's like he sits at the table for the dinner and then he he's the first one gone  we never see him  cos he cleans afterwards  no i'm talking about my father dear   oh your dad   about four words  and sleep in front of the t v words   that's right  you see you know what's good about it at least   you're trapped  you're trapped laugh   you can't like you could go to the other room where the kids were but uh it's colder in there  it's not as warm as here   i'm glad i didn't take apart that table too  oh that's the best table for the kids to paint on and stuff like that   i know  we shouldn't sell it now   ya it's true eh  ya   we should sell that thing right there  which thing  word   well i mean  is that what you were talking about when you were saying you don't like that  no uh they're of the two tables   i said i prefer this one not uh this one word  oh   i don't like  even now that it's finished i don't like it as much  i don't like it as much either  no it's kind of a word   but i do like it a lot  like a real lot  they didn't like that one compared to this one  really eh  ya  they don't know what to look for i guess   because   well no even phillip said that that was a   a nicer table as far as to sell like right now   yawn well i prefer that one ten times better  well that one's older  that's more my style  ya it's you know old and word    it's older  like you said i like the legs and i like the style   of it   its got the five legs  you know it looks antiquey  so they were impressed by my furniture store buying  eh  cos your cos your dad saw  what's the word   groan i can't believe he spent a year working on two words   no i know   he's exaggerating   ya  either that or he didn't have paint stripper laugh   word many years long   laugh ya laugh   it doesn't work  ya  no way  maybe it laugh   ya  uhm uh remember that movie  oh it was so scary   ya it is scary  i hate clowns  me too  no i really hate clowns   so the apartment is now taken  chantelle she had me right in the du   a few words two words   i know   i was like  cos i told her uh before  i said uh you know on the phone did you hear i said well i'm having joe's 's parent's over for dinner so i really don't   wanna want to do you know much today or whatever  she goes well okay i just called and duh duh duh  she really imposes herself or  like if i say no that's fine but otherwise she's uh  ya my problem's more important than your   your stuff   ya exactly  so she called you know i started writing  everyt everything   she goes okay we're gonna going to make a lease   so i said uhm o okay you  gonna going to mail me a lease and she goes no no  i'm just gonna going to write a couple  uh i wrote a couple of things down i want you to write them down  i was like uh okay now   now   ya exactly right  that's it   laugh i'm in the middle of serving a dinner to

sat there  he didn't like that though eh  no my mom went and sat with him and read him a book   cos they don't want him to get all wired  that's a good name for it though the penalty box  ya you go sit there and be quiet laugh for two minutes  that's good  it's like the time-out chair  ya the time-out chamber   well they weren't doing anything wrong  they were just having fun  they were just like running and screaming and bouncing off word and wrestling and they just wanted   ya well but i understand  i understand but we have people that live downstairs and they didn't  i think it was very good that they did that  ya but i mean they weren't really being bad kids  they were just being kids  ya   he's funny eh  i wish i had videoed that when he was singing  who   oh that was hilarious  he does the three voices  ahhhh singing a high note   laugh is that what he was doing   laugh word again   or ya he was going its   itsy singing the first one is normal voice you know itsy bitsy spider la la la la  singing whatever  ya  the second one is the great a few words   quote singing   so do that too   that's the thrid one  and then the th third one is itsy bitsy singing   oh i see ohh   phrase wicky wicky wee singing   see and like everyone stopped what they were doing and said what's that noise  and he's in the middle of the room acting it out  whitty whitty wee singing

playschool  does he go to the same one that reagan went to last year  i don't know  i doubt it  so i don't think we're going to go camping much  anymore eh looking at those videos before   yawn i'm tired   so you think we're gonna going to  we'll try it again after hunting season  uh no  laugh   probably uh stay word camping and go hiking  or my dad had a good idea we should get into cross-country skiing for the  winter   what was that   oh ya but i mean  we could go on cross-country ski trails cos there's real nice trails apparently like super nice  oh really   you just bring a day pack your lunch  park the van and  then a few words   ya   i could get into that very much  but you don't wanna want to do snowshoe  ya for sure  i'd like i'd love to do the snowshoeing  but snowshoeing's for like going to a peak  well no you do snowshoeing you can do snowshoeing like uh   well if we're just going to cover terrain like go across  uh i'd rather do skis   ya you'd rather do it with cross- country skis  it's fast  okay  you know you never know  snowshoeing it's  well do you wanna want to look at buying a secondhand pair or  ya the mcgill ski sale should be coming out this month  you see i think that a pair of you know the cross-country ski boots like the old-fashioned kind  the leather  ones those would be good for uhm snowshoeing   ya   ya   because it would seem to me that the water wouldn't get in  ski boots no they're they have a  tongue in the front of them sort of and it jets out  oh that's true  it would fit in to word   the cross-country ski ones though   ya   do they  ya  mh  look what i have over here that i've been picking at  a zit  no  it's like they're  i've got bumps all along here   incomplete phrase   is it red like a zit  ya it looks like a pimple  a little itty bitty teeny tiny  oh great i just said that when this was thing on  oh look at this wart i have growing  look at this huge boil i have on my ass   laugh oh shut up  lookit look at it should we pop it  we'll lance that boil  oh ya   okay let's not get gross  no let's not  did you blow out the pumpkin or did it  no i it had it's thing in and it just went out by itself   he's a mean lookin looking pumpkin eh  that's the most s s cynic   what's the word sinister looking pumpkin i've ever made  ya   ew he's scary  we should throw him off the balcony now  laugh   laugh pow   ya   it's funny your sister never heard of mat n   mat night eh the night before halloween ( devil's night): west island montreal specific   no  she went to a french school though  why  do the french don't have that  i guess they don't no  gosh that was like brutal   that was so much fun to go out on mat night  mat night   my parents wouldn't let us out on that night usually and then when i got to be like fourteen i go out  it's like a license to be mischievious  oh ya  it's ya   it's expected  my dad knew what it was  he says that's the night you take all your mats in   cos people are probably gonna going to take your mats  ya   and shoot eggs at your house  and shoot eggs laugh   ya that's what we used to do shoot eggs at people's houses   sounds like fun  wanna want to go get some eggs  do we have eggs  laugh go shoot some at the neighbour's house   we could shoot some we could shoot some two or three words  expense about three words   laugh   we should eh  ya at name 's house  at name 's house  haaa   ah ha ha ha fake laughing   oh he would not understand that i don't think  his sense of humour is uh word   he's a farmboy  he must have shot a dozen eggs  i don't know if they celebrate  ya right the closest the closest   house to him was four miles away  dozens and dozens of eggs   oh fuck ya   carry that egg two words   go to the neighbour's and shoot  eggs at laugh their house for a while   laugh   i wonder who did it laugh   eh   the only other family   it's those damn sanchez kids   the sanchez kids  rodriguez actually  oh that's his last maybe two words   maybe two words   rodriguez   is that how you pronounce it  rodriquez or rodriques   amelie pronounced it differently  it's uh spanish  it's a spanish name  see it sounds french to me   rodriguez rodriguez   rodrigues is how i pronounce it  they don't sound like it sounds better in french than it   does in english   i think it sounds like uh mexican  that's why i call him sanchez  oh ya   really  on the first time he told me his name i said well okay i'll call you sanchez  sanchez   so that became his name  it's funny cos his dad doesn't look uh  yes he does  really   very much  you find he looks spanish  yup   his mom is french canadian or no his mother's english right  ya she looks english  i don't know  ya   she looks familiar to me   like i like i feel like i know her from somewhere  you met her on an acid trip  laugh right  she's a flake  ya she's a bit flaky just like amelie  and that's why they've got s   she's like she's like   a chain-smoking sort of hippy-dippy artist kind of person  ya   which is cool cos she's she's  really nice 
Canada	" ya   cough   and amelie is well she's not as she's less  flaky now   flaky now   ya she's making more sense  ya  i think it's cos once she gets to know you she sort of like stops with the act  ya  it's just an act eh the flakiness  is it   ya  you think so  ya   why would anyone want to put on an act to do that   a few words i don't know but   it's a total act  like when she first met us that's a total act   like that fake laugh giggling and oh what are you doing in that little baby voice and all that stuff that's not her  you saw how she was  ya  about four words   she made sense talked intelligent had an opinion that made sense you know   ya   i don't know she was acting  laugh she was acting pretty crazy in in   the the room  when i was cutting my hair   i don't wanna want to be the first   really i thought a few words   when you were all sitting around here  ya she was being kind of normal but i i   like after the haircut like you know come  o on she was g she was   really upset  three or four words   she goes okay  she goes i won't go home and cry i promise  she's just joking word   no   ya   ya  rock says she has a real dry sense of humour  yawn you don't know that she's joking  but i'm sure she was just kidding  no she really wasn't  she was going it's so short  she was like being very serious  she not 'she's' going it's so short i'm not used to it  she goes  cos she told me the whole story  she goes the last time this uh i got my hair cut this guy butchered my hair and i went home and cried  she goes i was so upset  i said how short did they cut it  she said well it was like to the middle of my back  and i said like it is now  like i j you know like i just  cut it   and she goes you you left it a little bit longer like that  and i was like uh you know i made sure this this   like that was want she wanted   right  but uh   like i say i think she's just  no she wasn't joking joe   you don't think so eh   no i know so   i know so   anyways i thought she made more sense  ya she did  like i like her i like her more  you know what it is she's nicer when she's not around  rock   ya way nicer  when she's around rock she turns into   like sometimes   like at first when i met her i didn't like her to tell you the truth  and and on that first day i was   like what does she  expect and then by the end of the week  it was like okay well she sorta sort of  loosened up a  bit word when we went to his parents  well neither did i  i was so sick of her   ya  mhh   ya   ya   and then as i got to know her i was okay she's not so bad  i liked her right away laugh   ya when she was over here i though ah she's okay you know   a few words   she was like actually making intelligent comments you know  instead of going into the ahh  wahh she turns into a whiny sort of dingbat sometimes and oh la la la la you know  and puts on that little baby face like  poor me i'm just so stupid i  don't understand   no i liked her right away   i thought she's uh   ya   she plays helpless   she's too   laugh   no she does that  she does that  i think she does that more around men for some reason or something   phrase   ya like   like she doesn't do it as much around me and she  was always nice she was nice to me like   like a few words on thursday  maybe two words like a whole new person  ya   ya  but around rock she does it and she's always mad at him for something   about four words   she's constantly pissed off at him  ya yawn ya that only does one thing though  like that's going to make him callous to a point where now he's even like and joe even said it like he goes ya i've come to a point now where i've accepted that she's always mad at me so it's just like the norm now  so   he doesn't check his behaviour all the time  he's just like whatever i do what's logical and you know she deals with it and i don't get all  cos he used to get all upset when she'd be like oh rock  la la la la you know and he'd try to make it better and nothing works you know  he realized that now so  mhh hmm  whatever   cough whatever  he just accepts the fact that she you know she's  off her off her mark on that one you know   off her rocker   ya   so it doesn't work  if you're always mad it doesn't work   so we gonna going to dress up tomorrow and uh stand at the two words  a few words   ya   i'm gonna going to go as uh  you'll put some rope on me there and fray the ends of the rope and tie it all in knots and you could do the same thing except put like uh sewing needles on yourself and everything  and what are you gonna going to   be   what are you supposed to be  i'll be a frayed knot as in "" afraid not""   and you'll be a and you'll be a  frayed sew as in "" afraid so""   laugh   laugh where did you get that from  laugh you'll be a frayed sew and i'll be a frayed knot  ahh  what do you think  sounds good to me  okay  where'd you get that from  reed who else   did he get that in his book  no in his head  no  ya  really  reed ya not too much goes on up there just bizarre things  laugh a frayed not and a frayed sew   a frayed not and a frayed sew   our poor neighbours downstairs must have gone crazy today  ya they must hate it that the summer's over and we're home every weekend inviting our family members over stomping around  laugh i know   bang bang bang  well at least it's not very often  ya once every month  ya   it's not so bad   will this go off automatically   no  we have to uh time it   ya  well i guess that's enough for now   i might get ready for bed  i'm pretty tired  ya me too  i feel like there's something i should be doing  what do you mean that you forgot to do  did you do all your estimates  no i didn't do them  i have no energy to start calculating now  did you d ever do mrs uhh what's her name the lady that kept on calling there  oh ya ya sure  you handed it to her  and there's that man that you said you were going to do in the springtime  oh ya i gotta have got to go visit him this week  oh you haven't been there  no  i keep telling these people look i'm booked till january you know at least and maybe till march you know   it looks like march anyway if this lady signs  so like what the fuck you know  what am i going to do okay i'm gonna going to  rush over there and give you an estimate for some work that i can do in uhh half a year two word thing   well they probably want an estimate like from a couple of people and then they can   ya well that's it so waste my time you know  ya well it's like that woman   a few words i'd rather find out   are you are you willing to wait for me   you know   well the thing is is     and then ya but in the meanwhile mrs  buchanan or whatever said the same thing well just give me an estimate just give me an  phrase   and now she's taking you  she's going with you isn't she  no she says well if we don't find anyone else i guess we're going to have to wait till spring word is what she said  but it's a lot of work to drive out someplace spend a few hours with them and then and then come back figure it out ya figure out  write it all out   i thought that was pretty weird sort of like expecting you to do that   but she said it out loud  like she said it to me and uhm i know she said it to you too she goes well if you can't do it that's okay but i just want another estimate so i can compare it  it's like what do ya you just want to waste his time   ya you want to waste my time ya  exactly  that's how i feel  so you know that's why like all these estimates i'm doing is like ya well uh can you wait six months you know or can you wait  most people would say well it's a little ridiculous to wait half a year  ya   i'll go find someone else  like this guy he said okay i'll wait till spring should i book you now ya  oh ya   now two words   so now you know he's serious  now i go see him   and like this one this basement i'm gonna going to do for annette wynn cough uh i don't like  that working for her that much laugh    annette wynn   ya  i didn't work for her before so  why  i don't know she's  she's not very nice  no just sorta sort of like alway's trying to bargain ya you and  you're always bargaining and negotiating every little thing and  oh really   oh ya  it's like this is the hourly rate it's twenty-five bucks an hour you pay the materials you know and that's the end of it  she's firm   you wanna want to count my hours you watch me  oh is that what they do  that's what i'm gonna going to do  ohh   you know she last time i   did it i had to have one price for the whole job you know and she bargains when she gets the price and then when it's come time to pay she bargains again you know  but you don't give in do you  no but it's still a pain you know   ya   it's like oh now we have to go through everything and okay and this cost me that add it up  so this way you collect it at the end of the week  type of thing   ya so ya exa i look i did you know whatever forty hours that's a thousand dollars   here are my hours  she made me buy all of my material  that's the person you were talking about last week  at the dinner table  ya   ya ya  that's three or four words   ya when jenny and anna don't feel like  anyway i'd rather do another job somewhere else but  well it's sort of good because you can make good money when you do it that way because then you don't have to estimate anything  you don't have to estimate  well just like working for for them it's like they're nice and everything you just   i don't know a bit of a pain  you know what i just realized right  it's gonna going to be hanukkah soon  what   you gotta have got to get cracking on buying gifts for the kids and stuff   yaa cracking   you know how much money we spent or i spent  on  this dinner   well i   this one   how much  about sixty bucks at least  ya   like imagine how much yawn how much   uh i'm falling asleep  how much jen spends everytime  oh i know but they have the money   two words comes home  well they have the money but still you know when it's our turn it's our turn  i know  i feel like  i was glad they they brought wine  i'm glad we didn't buy any   ya see ya i knew it  ya

well i want you  you see  i'm pretty sick of the whole thing too  you know it's just like ya ya whatever  you know all the crap that goes with it  ya but it it helped you a lot  ya well just the weekly meeting  just you know sitting around  that's enough  tell me enough of that shit man  you know take a cake and eat the word   well it's a big thing and for some people  not for me  not for you but you have me  some people don't have anybody and and  tha   ya i know it's the the   highlight of their life  ya   you know they fucking live for it  ya  hey i wonder if i'm getting this from my earrings cos it's right at the  the this rash  jeez i wonder eh maybe if you staple metal to the side of your head you get a rash  laugh   makes sense   it makes sense huh   no cos i realize that this it's  the where the uh money is that's where i'm getting this rash  right down here and right in the same spot on the other side  well stop wearing those rings   that makes sense   but i love these earrings   and uh she did her usual act you know   which was   uh which was uh trying to run around all over the place and trying to put to do too much altogether  so  well what do you expect she's young laugh   ah ya  so   she forgiven me yet  i don't know  i still let her get three or four words  laugh   i didn't ask her laugh   dad said he's coming down for her birthday  mhh hmm  but uh he said don't tell her yet because  it's not guaranteed or  ya  ya which   was   i still haven't found the rod for him too  well it depends on the weather too  you know the sudbury nights are are   or it's not very nice to travel  it's not to travel on the road but   he's he was in larder  eh  is he in there right now  no  well he was just there for the weekend  oh okay  wanted to make sure the house was alright and you know that  nothing was frozen  wells it's still nice in that area   mhh hmm   i mean it was col the weather's not that cold   doesn't he just turn off the water  he did  he turned off the hot water but he did hot water tank but he's gotta got to  he has to keep the water flowing  ya   oh the cold water  mhh hmm  oh okay  so he turns the heat down to minimum and saves electricity that way  how come he always goes through you laugh    why   no everytime i phone him and talk to him he always passes the phone to you after all  well he figures that you want to talk to me  nah laugh   ah laugh   usually sam sam does sam  he says is mom around and then he talks to me  and i say how's everything  oh not too good mom  i say okay what's the problem  laugh   so you see your father doesn't get the problems i do  ahh  so maybe i should change that  ya you should  you should   should should phone sammy  and say how come you don't talk to dad about your problems   laugh   laugh   what you don't think he's sensitive or   uhm ah   well dad gets the good times and i get the problems usually  usually  it works it works out the other way anyway between mother and son right "
Canada	 mhh hmm   ya i think so  so what are you going to do for christmas then  have we decided yet  i'll probably be down here   so you're going to stay in my apartment  and look after my  place   ya   mhh hmm   cos sharon come up  i don't know  uh she might  okay  that's good   she's getting a lot of hassles from the  family  i'll bet  ya so   ya don't i know exactly what's happening there but uh ya i'll go down and find out  i think i'm gonna going to write a little letter back and give all her family shit  laugh   laugh   well maybe that's not the best way to approach it now   well if they can guilt her out i can guilt them out  well i know but you know let them have their run  and they'll get over it in somewhere  let them work it out of their system  ya  and i think things will work out all right  well they're sort of catholics though  my being divorced twice doesn't exactly help matters  no no laugh   laugh   they don't look at you as somebody somebody  that might stay around permanently maybe  no  that could be the problem   uh no it's just a sin to get a divorce  well  but  and then there's this whole guilt trip they're laying on her  worse than any you laid on us laugh   i don't remember laying any guilt trips on you  mhh a couple small ones here and there  three words   laugh well   as long as it wasn't too many  no  they weren't bad though  i mean you didn't really bother us like phone rings   and you didn't do any gang-up features  no  so it's not too bad  i found a shirt for your dad for christmas  oh ya  bright pink  no  actually remember he was looking for the suede in the    in this part in the top part of of the shirt  laugh   ya   oh ya  well i found one down on my street  on sherbrooke down towards victoria  and the price was right  it was twenty dollars off  it's sort of ah it's sort of a   how can i say  it's got about three colours in it but it's quiet enough  like it's got a lot of   it has a lot of browns  you know what i mean   oh okay  ya   and the browns and kind of like a beige with a touch of uhm  what i call that burnt orange  mhh  not too much  just a touch of it in there  and i tried it on  fits me so it's going to fit him  and it's comfortable on me  it's not tight or anything   oh ya   so if it fits me usually it fits him  dad he's got such taste in clothes sometimes laugh  i know laugh   some of the stuff i won't let him wear at all laugh   such   remember those shirts he brought us  which ones  the ones that made me look like a complete nerd  laugh   laugh   pink with the thing and the whatnot coming down  cough   oh i know  he he he still visualizes me about i don't know but i think about a hundred and forty pounds because everytime he buys something he he  sees that i'm about that size  laugh   three words expanded in his eyes  isn't that nice  maybe three words   it's too bad it didn't work out for more people laugh  nobody gets fat laugh   laugh   your clothes just get smaller laugh   exactly   well   well anyway two words is the cirque du soleil still going on  ahh i think it goes on for  i can't remember the date   is it till the eleventh something like that or the twelfth  hmm   i couldn't get tickets  i tried to get tickets  hmm   did you get any  no but i didn't try  maybe you could try through uh alison   alison   ya  you know   i wou i wouldn't   three words mary-anne   i wouldn't mind taking mary-anne   alison 1 min, 30 sec: conversation about recording, with extra corpus speaker   okay we'll have to try that  ya so i'll try to do it through the nation newspaper   ya  that's the one good thing about the newspaper  laugh   uh uh cough  maybe three words open stories   it's amazing how some people get   no you can get free tickets to just about anything you want  laugh or want to see laugh   write a story on it and if you enjoy it  i was telling benny today the christmas party i was talking to uh the thistle representa rep  representative that came around and it's like two dollars each  i told her that i was going to bring the two of you and she said that was fine  and it's at a place called reggie's  benny 's said he's heard of it  he knows what it is  reggie's  reggie's  what's this for  christmas party  for two words   concordia   oh concordia okay   oh my yes  huh that should be wild  okay   so i told him that i was going to bring two young men 1 minute: conversation about recording   well i really liked that story on the dreamcatcher  i though it was really well written   mhh hmm   the the guy actually deserved to win  you should see on the entry he sent us laugh he's  quite a prolific writer word said  oh he sent a letter   how were the others  uh not bad  uh we have one one favourite called my cousin reg which we're going to entitle as fictional but it's probably a true story laugh   oh really   it sounds quite good   it's like everyone has a little bit of a cousin reg   the uh  it's about a guy who uh lives on a rez informal: indian reservation   a young guy and his cousin reg comes to visit right from another place  and reg is a real basically he's a real asshole  laugh   you know he bothers girls even when they don't like him  he's like going over bothering em them   just just all this stuff  he gets into fights and he gets drunk and at the end of it he kills this dog right and sort of swears him to secrecy  and then you know like he's freaking out  this kid is freaking out over his cousin reg  right laugh   oh my gosh   and then all of a sudden someone comes and takes reg  away  you know like i guess like reg 's family arrives and he  two words   laugh   maybe three words him is a rest  everyone has a rest from cousin reg right  mhh  and so all of us still sat down and we all read it and we all laughed and said well we're going to have to say this is a fictional thing  and in in this story like before it the guy says you know i'm changing the name of my cousin to  you know so so no one will know who it is but i mean if you know who the guy is it's not hard to trace down his cousins  no no   laugh but i'm sure you can trace down who his cousin is laugh and find out that this guy killed the dog  laugh   he shot some poor dog some guy's dog so it's   laugh oh dear   so the guy's an embarrassment to his family  laugh ya and this guy wrote about it  and he's one of the contest winners laugh quite few words   that was the story we remembered the most   oh no   like every one of us laughed at it laugh  what about the other stuff  were there any female writers  uh ya  some females writers  uh webequie has this huge preoccupation with death  you're right   almost every story coming out of uh webequie uhm had something to do with someone dying you know committing suicide or  word it's the forth  it's the forefront thing in in your mind  like at the moment  mhh hmm   you know what i mean  if there's a lot of suicides in that area you're naturally going to think about those things when you think about home  ya  but like to me that's like that's like   not a very healthy indication of the town  i mean that's that's  you know your your youth's major preoccupation is death and suicides and whatnot i mean obviously there's  there's something wrong there  you know  no   mhh hmm   but then we always knew there was something wrong there   anyhow laugh   that's why we write about it   laugh   you fellas better start finding something good about  weben webequie   oh we do find good things about webequie  we've written good things about webequie   i mean people just don't see that  they just   no   of course they hear all the all the   other scandalous stories laugh and they get off on that a lot more  right right   that's true  but i mean the guy is a scandal  he should just get out of there  ya  you know the the reason why i think he's holding on so much is he's got a lot of two words    you know like you don't hold on this to m   uh with such a such a grip unless there is something there  mhh hmm  i mean it's it's kind of obvious  when your financial statements that you hand in  ya   you're supposed to hand in your financial statements every year  and the statements that you hand in are two years out of date  right ya   then you refuse to give you know your  your holding company  like you know how we have uh eastmain enterprises  and that   mhh hmm   well could you imagine them refusing to give their annual statements at a uh annual band meeting of everybody  no i can see them   well that's what they did at uh  webequie for sageen  but many times those things are presented uh uh to the public  and the public don't understand what they're about anyway   mhh hmm   but these guys refused to even bring up any numbers   so i mean  cough   i know the first years uh i went to the band council meetings at home hardly anyone ever questioned the amounts of money that we were that they were being asked to to pass   to approve for whatever project was going on  to approve ya   that's why nis'ko became such ah a white elephant in the end  i mean you know  mhh hmm   and then they tried tried to bury that and you can't bury it  it's going to come up all the time   that's probably why you see an entire new band council there  it could be  it could be   but uh you don't or people seem to be afraid to speak out and say well that's uh i don't think you should  give them any more money  nobody wanted to two or three words   well the problem with that is i think is is   it's because when you do speak out you get you get uh you get singled out   you know what i mean  and and people sitting up there that are supposed to be listening to you and looking for your responses and whatnot attack you  mhh hmm  and i mean it's it's embarrassing to be attacked  word hand   first of all they're sitting higher than you  you know like usually they're not even the same level  no and you know that they have disagreed with you that   three - quarters of the of the  public that you're sitting with will feel the way that they do  because they're sitting in that position  and people come out from out of nowhere   and a and attack the system that they're you know    word   mhh hmm   ya   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   it's uh   it's it's like what they did to the trappers  they ganged up on them and they they   used cree culture against them  you know their own culture and they go this is for the best of the people the best of everybody and you're the one holding it up you're the one causing the problems you know  ya   and cree way of life is sharing and cooperation everything else  and so they're saying you're going against that when you're actually living the traditional life and they're not  right right   ya  you know they're the ones forcing you into that situation where to live by your own principles you have to do the wrong thing  ya yup  and that's what i feel is wrong   yup i do too 
Canada	 you know it's like those things would have never even been thought of being asked thirty forty years ago  you know like  well no because your band council was  all two words   it didn't have   yes  and they didn't have that many decisions to make  not as many as they did once once the area started opening up and they had other problems other si   situations o other  alternatives to look at  another way of life  so it was hard for them to it was hard for them to  go ahead and and say to the band council that you know uhm i don't believe in what you're doing  and you don't they don't understand  how to start it   mhh hmm   like you say the old traditional way was not to question   really  mhh hmm   you know it's noise in the background, laughing   what are you guys doing over there   nothing 1 minute 55 sec: conversation with extra-corpus speakers   he says when i grow up or when i grow up she said and have a baby then you die  and that was it  he said is it alright if i stay around   laugh   for a little while   yes you can she says  laugh   well somebody's been telling me that  that i die when she grows up so ya that was something to be afraid of to think about   my i wonder where she gets that from   i don't know  i think you better come start chasing ghosts out of the house again    really  ya   laugh   she's quite a character  well she might have a bit of ah the old stuff  what the ghosts  i don't know   laugh   the ghosts  a few spirits drawn there laugh   i don't know  if they're bad spirits you better come chase laugh them out  well i got some sweetgrass there  we can use that  we threw that mattress in her bedroom  ya   ya  uh i don't know if we should have kept it or not  it looks like it's pretty well finished  ya  two words her and catherine from next door have been jumping up and down on it and having a ball  laugh   so i just left it in the bedroom on the floor  oh okay  but i think you know i don't think i'll use it  ya  i think i'll just ask uh morris to come and get it  remove remove it cos i  don't think we need it  uh huh   maybe three words   cos you and benny gonna   going to come move that couch for me  oh ya 3 minutes 45 sec: conversation with extra-corpus speaker   and they just sat there  like they just sat and watched and and uh  i don't know i thought well i wonder if they're really enjoying themselves or or what here  huh  you always get a few watchers laugh   uh ya i guess   it's probably that two words to dance  ya  then when she was meant to get up she finally caught  up  so that was a nice little those were nice   those little   who was   ya well it was her hubby right   uh cough hubby at home because it was ah a women's association  oh right  oh i heard a few words   have you heard his tapes  no i haven't yet heard   they're very nice  tommy was a few words   sending me his tapes  two words send me one   yup  you'll have to send me some  i mean it   uhh there's one where he sings to her and   she's uh/[>  what are you doing   you can't open them 2 minutes 50 sec: conversation with extra-corpus speaker   oh that's too bad eh dear   cough   well i'm kind of happy  she was you were fifteen and she was already bringing out the magazines type of home she wanted and   how many children and what she was  going to wear to the wedding laugh   oh god ya   laugh   that was kind of soon for us laugh   laugh   ya   it was the phone calls i think that bothered me the most  oh they bothered your dad  i mean you were no sooner in through the door i mean taking her home and then the ru the phone would ring fifteen minutes after and dad would say i guess  bill must be on his way home  laugh   he was just must have just  left her front door 2 minutes, conversation with extra-corpus speakers  no chance at all laugh   no chance laugh at all   i'm glad a few words laugh    ya   you know what was the best though was when your brothers would sit there   oh god   we walked into the living room and  rhonda had come in with that short little whatever it was that she wore  i think it was a slip or whatever it was that she was wearing at the time laugh   laugh   and your brothers'd brothers would  be watching and she'd come in and they'd flip around laugh  and sit there and watch rhonda   laugh   laugh   forget about the t v   and uh   that was fun   i wonder who she did marry in the long run   ya she would have got married to somebody who wanted  word an awful lot  oh i think so  i think she probably turned out alright  she's probably got a big family  word happy with her husband  she should have found herself a farmer   she liked farming  i'm sorry  did she like   she likes lots of kids  lots of kids laugh   laugh   well our poor friend hannah got caught by a farmer and  she's got lots of kids  uh i never pictured her as a farmer's wife   i always pictured her word  and word doing something  like   well   ya   when i was out to see her the last time she'd just helped one of the cows calf  wow laugh   cos brad 's   well brad was laid up  he had fallen off the tractor and he had sprained his uhm shoulder  mhh hmm   and uh apparently you had to put on this great big  long glove that covers your whole arm and turn the calf or whatever help the calf when it's being born  word   wow  and you know how small she was  i mean what was she  ya   she was word   ninety pounds soaking wet right  laugh   ya  but otherwise she's about a hundred and twenty maybe now  ya   mhh hmm   but still a very small  she says and brad was standing behind her saying well  you know get a good grip now laugh   laugh   so she'd come a long ways from the time that you knew her in high school   watch she'll a few words   word she getting into it  ya she loves the guy so  well ya  he burnt himself out  i mean farming is a hard uh it's a hard occupation   you gotta have got to be at it for sixteen hours a day   so   what is it  he joined the church got her to marry him laugh and then left the church  laugh yes  you notice that laugh word   word 30 sec: conversation with extra-corpus speaker   it actually wasn't that bad  hmm  it was actually wasn't that bad  no   yawn

restaurant did he  no  nei neither did i actually  he's not   well dad isn't the type like you know like uh  hmm   two words   i like going to them with elana and i enjoy them  but if dad doesn't

either you  know   no   no it's not his   no no  so  you know we're we're gonna  going to be  first of all we're more interested in staying with the family   and then going to see someone else's family and laugh   yes   i'm just sorry benny didn't get down that weekend  ya  that would've been nice  ya   so anyhow since her parents aren't really going to  support this on her side you said that we're going to have a traditional wedding but not a cree traditional wedding  of what kind  i don't know  i'm going to check with the uh natives down there and see what type they have  the wampanoag native american tribe of massachusetts   oh so you you may get married down in  down down in the states but  down in the states okay   but this time i'd like you guys to come  okay  you haven't been

no not really   laugh   no  it would be different  it would depend on uh dad depend what he was doing at the time  well what'd i'd like to do is get something close to montreal since dad will probably be in montreal  ya   mhh hmm  uh can't do the cree one because the cree one says i have to go and live with the family for a year and it   and they don't want you laugh   laugh   i have to  well i have to give them everything i earn and then at the end of the year he gets to say whether or not i get to stay married to his daughter   laugh   well you're suppoed to work for him   ya  so i i i

spend a week down there and i can do all that research at the same time 
Canada	 and my mother's gone through two also  laugh   hmm   laugh   they need constant constant attention  you have to water them every day  for mother's day i bought my mother a box of pans  uhm they had them at club price the pansy box  it's a little flower box  it's wooden  mm hmm  and comes with a packets of seed and enough earth to fill it and instructions  oh nice  oh nice  nice if it works  muffled laugh you know   nothing's come up yet  well audibly swallows we just we just did them last week  oh okay  well it'll take a while  that's beautiful   and i called her once uh once in a while m call her more than once in a while but  i once in a while when i call her i say did you water the pansies cos she's very bad with plants  oh dear  she's oh yeah yes yes yes every time i pass   i've left uh p a thing of water by its side  and whenever i pass by i give it a drink  we had t mm we had flower boxes in the back  of our house  phew   mm hmm   they're uh fixed to the side of the wall on the deck  mm hmm  and i often forget about them and um they just bake out there in the sun  mm  then i walk out one day and they look laugh starts   almost sparse laugh ends and i take the hose and drench them down  we just put flowers in in the weekend in  the front  you know that little square thing  mm hmm   ya mm ha   and we bought some roses   i was in cu uh not cut price canadian tire at the cash  mm hmm   two ninety-nine  rose bushes   oh you can't go wrong   so i bought one cos it was uh th th was the one at alexis neon mall   i'm okay aside, followed by the sound of b pouring a drink   okay  and uh i thought thank god i didn't carry more than one  cos as i was walking i realised can get pretty heavy  mm hmm  i was i was tempted to get two  anyway we we then we went to the canadian tire out our way and they were still regularly priced at five ninety-nine  so trevor we went when we went  to church we came in to church in town so we uhm we came downtown to alexis neon and they had a few left  mm hmm  like from cos uh at first there was this huge table filled with them and there was like i  dunno don't know how many could there be  twenty-five left of them but inhale they were gettin  getting some of them were grungy and some of them had snapped off and you had to be careful and   y'ave to you have to  take care of them though and make sure they don't freeze and cover them   up and   uh huh   munching   get straw and hay for them and all kinds of things  don't know if i wanna want to get   that much into gardening  wood chips   i think trevor does  mm hmm munching   i think trevor uh that's his  actually his door slams name speaker sounds like they are saying 'aim' with an 'n' is to have a rose garden  mm hmm   he has some great admiration you hear it  his eyes sorta sort of glaze over   when laugh starts he talks about it laugh ends  mm hmm   you know what i mean laugh   so i thought oh   so i picked that up and so i think we've ended up with five of them  so we put trevor stuck two in the ground munching in the front and we bought a  we went to zellers and we found a bo they were selling seventy-five percent off these bulbs dahlias  speaker pronounces this as 'dullias'   i bought bulbs from zellers and none of them took  i hope you have more luck than i did  mm  maybe i did something wrong  maybe i didn't plant them deep enough or maybe the squirrels went and ate them  but i got one lily out of the whole caboodle and i think i spent about forty dollars on bulbs i's i was  really disappointed  i know could be 'oh no'   these were like fifty cents a package  so again we don't care  it's just uhm basically an experiment  mm hmm mm mm  munching   but munching i bought manure and peat moss and  soil and  gee you bought manure   i could've taken you up to the stable munching   word   i bought compo composted  manure  mm hmm  you ever stopped word to cri  craven   the greenhouse there  is it called craven or someth   sheridan   which greenhouse  the one on the way to you guys  the one on st johns  that sheridan munching   kramer  kramer  kramer  okay  there's another place munching closer  mm munching   you know where the where the restaurant is uhm  le perrot restaurant  where munching   where where thum  the uhm pearls and petals is   mm hmm mm hmm munching   well right next door well just a little ways down on st johns there's a house there  oh this is on the other side  n nn     no  no on the same side as the street on on the  my side of st johns there's a house munching  and and he sells flowers there  some for a little bit cheaper than most nurseries  mm  small little private garden there you know   uhm   right   and my neighbour buys all her flowers there and she's very happy     two or three words munching   word munching i really i  wanna want to get into this  mm hmm  and like uhm our sunday school teacher it was she was she's so she's so funny  i said oh we put we put flowers in the ground and she looks at me flat out and says dear you don't  put flowers in the ground you grow them  from seed  laugh   you plant them   oh   oh i see     two or three words   but she's it a lot of her expressions are mock er like it's mocking   and i think it puts off a lot of people because  they think she's being serious or or   mm   or superior or something  yeah and it it i suppose it  could come across that way but i've maybe i've  just chosen not to take it that way  mm   well you get used to someone and you know which way they're coming from and then it's easy to   i mean i know she's very categorical but i think  i feel there's always a leeway there to sorta  sort of not sort of two words  around it  mumble starts you see   so i four words mumble ends but basically sh it's taken her eight years  to grow perennials  like to get the garden to what it is today   and it's beautiful  it's like a sanctuary  mm hmm   oh some people spend their whole summer out in the garden  and ah munching they're beautiful but   you can't you have to make sure someone's   gonna going to look after them when you go away and  mm hmm   that can be a lot of work  mm  so   and it's very costly  well this is it  she said she doesn't have to buy any flowers now  yes because she has the perennials yeah  annuals munching     can two words quite a bit  oh yeah we spent well counting the manure and stuff like that it costs us forty dollars but we're not finished  i got some tomato plants at zellers   i got nine plants for two dollars and fifty cents  nine plants you're gonna going to  have a lot of tomatoes  yeah  i think so munching   that's if nobody dies you know  oh  you're counting on some dying  mm  sentence spoken through munching and laughter when they die laugh ends   laugh   probably  like word this  knowing my children  mm hmm  swallow well uhm  we have to we have to really work on our lawn this year munching   the weeds are just taking over but i refuse to have some kind of uhm a chemical spray on the lawn  mm hmm  because i wanna want to feel safe  with my kids my child and my child's friends playing on the lawn  i don't want   josie has a friend at school munching who just received a governor-general's award for his  uhm his stamina i guess  wow munching   one could say he's been fighting  he's only about ten year eleven years   old and he has uhm lymphatic uh cancer  mm hmm  and they believe it's from the spraying uhm   oh no   yeah they live on &icircumflex;le cadieux and they live right in between two golf courses which are heavily  sprayed   mm   mm   and uhm apparently the town of &icircumflex;le cadieux  has er had agreed to boycott the  spraying and i guess they ended up catering to pressure from the  owners of the golf course because they reneged on the decision  and this little boy's been campaigning he and his parents have been campaigning now for two years  and the decision went finally went  through council and then they reneged on the cou on the decision so munching   i think the mayor vetoed the decision or something so  there's there was a lot of controversy over that but  he attends school uhm about two-thirds of the time   and the other third of the time he he's  in hospital or at home  he's too sick to come to school  poor baby   and he's lost all his hair and  mm hmm  had a lot of treatment and whatnot and uhm   it's really sad you know uhm to see such a young child suffering  and i guess because we see him cos he's a member of the school it it makes it so much more ah  of an issue for us than if it was just something you read about in the paper and you think gee that's too bad but it's not gonna   going to happen to me or anybody i know kind of thing  mm   but so many people around us spray it's swallow   yeah  i'm afraid i'm guilty of that  munching   like with the lawn hose the weed and feed  well   that's much more controllable than this spra   the spray that the commercial people come   and do  mm hmm   you ever watch them they spray a lot of stuff munching  whereas most people if they're using just the weed and feed or killex they spray directly on to the affected area and that's it  munching   these people spray a lot and they don't seem to take into they're supposed to but i don't believe they take into consideration  children and animals that're that are in the area when they spray  mm hmm  and which way the wind is carrying  i was even concerned about there was a l   the little guy in the back was playing in his back yard with timmy and i told him to go well away while i was doing this even though i knew i wouldn't be touching them at all i just felt  better  mm hmm  yeah i know  i i feel the same way  but the weeds are awful on our lawn i mean  and we've been putting grass seed and   we well the weeds are very bad on our lawn too and they have been for some time because the  fellow who owned the house before us didn't really do anything  and uhm in fact he didn't even cut the grass  uh oh  cos i can remember driving by and seeing the grass  munching   mm probably above like above your waist kind of thing  mm hmm  uhm couple of times during the summer  so he he just let it grow and grow and grow  and i don't think that did wonders for the   for the grass   i'm sure it played havoc with the uhm  a few words     do you have a tissue  oops  ah  very good  all the comforts of hom home   recording is abruptly interrupted by an over-taping incident for about 10 secs; it appears the speakers have shifted into an office space   all the comforts of home everything's here   laugh   laugh   i uhm in my own offi  office today i i realized  that if i was gonna going to do some rearranging in my office that would probably grow  go against anna 's grain   if you were to rearrange your office it would go against   i think so  cos i mentioned something or other about   cos she wanted to stick some stuff in in   storage in my my office cos she saw some  empty spaces   and i said well i don't know i haven't decided whether i  wanna want to put the cabinet there or do this or that  it opened up a whole start heavy sarcasm  discussion end heavy sarcasm laugh   oh dear   i may ah m hah then i sort of realized oh oh  my office start laugh space is not my own end laugh   that's right  that's right now uhm   people are really touchy about space you know  it's a very very delicate issue  and i think that if you empower people with   with space i think you get more out of them you know  there's a productivity i'm sure that there   has to be inhales phone rings a productivity uhm  speaker a picks up and puts down phone receiver   jenna must have picked it up  uhm i'm sure that there must be ah an issue over productivity there because i think if if you  you have to have things the way you want them 
Canada	 and get things done ya   ya   so i've yet to do that type of wedding traditional wedding  mhh hmm   and i have a lot of friends  hope to do it maybe in i don't know new hampshire maine or vermont  some place where it's like a little wild a little old  fashioned   some place you know   mhh hmm   like maybe at mandy and les' on the mountain or something  ya that sounds nice  ya   ya   i wouldn't mind meeting them  randy used to call all the time  ya   i'd like to meet him  laugh well he a couple words  i'll write it down   oh i have their new phone number up there   where   they moved to alabama  oh did they  ya so i don't get a chance to see him when i go down there   so is he still making his uh uhh  sauce   sauce stuff   the hot chilli   they're still they're still  they're still doing a bit of that but he's working as a bouncer right now for a night club to support things until they get you know on their feet down there  and get going   mhh hmm   right ya   it's like it's it's difficult for them you know   they're a young couple  that's what uhh toby was telling me  uhm he was in uhm he went down near  timmins some place and he went in on reserve  one of the girls he's taking the course with  she's on a reserve there  mhh hmm   and uh he said they are so poor mom  like uh he said you know i maybe two words  log cabins  that's what they live in  that's their permanent homes like   they don't have the same   huh   i never found those too bad and actually i prefer them to the houses  well uhm ya we could have jumped up a little too fast and   got rid of a lot things  mhh   and uh maybe we went about it the wrong way  i don't know  because like  those would have been alright for the young couples  they w they would have enjoyed those  ya  and and the other thing too is it's the transitional phases  and   right  because like one of the things is i was talking to  one one of the guys and he said this was uhh   he said like he found one of the biggest problems with the house was is like traditionally he lives in a tent end of tape   but it's your system and you know how it works and you're comfortable with that and if somebody changes that  then if someone was to call looking for information things wouldn't be at your finger tips and and they wouldn't be where you left them  mhh hmm   and that's a very frustrating feeling cos you wanna  want to feel that you're in control and that  you're efficient and organized  mhh hmm   but you can't be if people have gone through your things and moved them to what they think is a better location  that's it   here in this office uh amanda uh felt that uhm  i i uh i suggested to her that i would speak to wanda about the office set up and where  i thought things should go because we had to advise the electricians which plugs we were using for the phones and which plugs we were using for the computers and that kind of thing   mhh hmm   so uhm and and she wasn't around at the time  so i went ahead and did that and suggested to her that this is how i saw it but that if she saw things differently that she should let them know as quickly as possible  and it's worked out well cos she agreed that that would probably be the best set-up and we haven't changed very much  the only thing is when dick left and larry  came in we acquired more files and we needed an additional bookcase  and and then where were we going to put it  mhh hmm   and so we had to send back a table and order something else  so there was some rearranging that had to be done there  and uh we were told what would be the best place for it and how to put it  uhm and uhm and and it was brought into the office that way and amanda quickly reorganized laugh  it into the way that she wanted it   mhh hmm sure  it's her space  i think she has to feel comfortable with it  that's it  i try not to close the door cos she gets no natural light at all except what comes through this door if the door's closed  mhh hmm   so i try to keep my door open all the time  mhh hmm  so she has a sense of the outdoors  mhh hmm  it's important  mhh hmm  and i   uhm unfortunately plants don't do as well in there as they do by the window here  so we keep trying to rotate the plants and put plants in there that we feel are going to make her feel that there's a sense of life  cos if you if if you're  working in an environment like that where there's no window very little daylight uhm you start to feel  i think it's w it would be a very depresing feeling  so we got two plants in there right now that are doing really well  mhh hmm  ya they like this kind of light  ya  we had another plant in there but it really liked the daylight so  we gave that one to larry   so he's got one in his office now   mhh hmm   well i want one of those  mhh hmm  actually i've been wanting a spider plant  did you get the spider plant from there too  ya  they're so nice and healthy those plants   ya i know  and they weren't expensive at all  you have purchased them  it's through a journal transfer  okay  uhm so what you could do is ju uh transfer it   did you carry them over   ya  uh no  we had distribution bring them over  okay   what you could do is have huh you could charge it to your budget and then write a cheque to the  university  yes   okay   and uhm   is that what you did   all of them are the office plants so when i leave i have to leave them unless i choose to purchase them  right so i mean i would basically want to do the same   if it if i was to bring one home i would purchase it or if i were to ever leave the office then i'd have to either do a journal transfer to my other office or purchase them outright  mhh hmm   that's it  but i wouldn't mind having a nice big tree   hmm  he doesn't have too many things that are big  i know  i had hoped that that would be bigger and since it isn't i put it on the radiator to make it look taller   and it's also close to the door  so that when amanda looks out she sees something  green   yes   no it's nice   and i like your mirror  i told you that before  with the wood  uhm   ya my brother gave me that  he didn't want it  oh   they we were in zellers the other day and they were selling park benches you know like the for  thirty bucks  wow  with the wrought iron  they must have been nice   like really heavy   mhh hmm  i wanted to put one in front of my door and in   in the front  like on that side there  mhh hmm   a small little one  well it's a two-seater  hmm  that's nice  i thought it would be  is it really a two-seater or is it a one and a half  did you try and sit in it  it's a actually it's a two and a half  oh that's nice   actually it's thomas  and i and both the kids were sitting in on   it  hmm   and they like squeezed in  uh huh uh huh  ya  you know we coulda could of like we could   oh that's nice   well  so you've been doing some major shopping  we didn't buy it  we were discussing   just looking   we were discussing it   i want it thomas i want it  and we have to buy a new carpet or something for it because it's it's it's awful  that carpet is ripped and  the indoor-outdoor  ya  we're scared of ripping it up  we don't know what's going to be underneath it  so i don't know  we have to have the whole thing word   you have to be prepared whatever you rip up  because there's probably glue  oh i'm sure that  you can see some black sort of spots there  mhh   mhh hmm  so we were going to go with brown carpeting  like a a beigey dark brown  colour that will match the house more  uh huh   can you get indoor-outdoor carpeting that colour  yup   you can get it in two colours green or brown  oh nice   mhh  you used to be able to get it i think in grey or black or something too   ya and you can  you can  but i thought  i don't know   it just didn't seem   it sorta sort of looks   more like an asphalt at that point  ya  it didn't sort of  i like things that go colours that go  together and blend together   mhh hmm   the you can see the   the green you wanna want to  with the grass but it's such an artificial green and it never really meshes with the grass  uh huh  it should be like a forest green rather than a what kind  like that's a golf green   it's like a leprechaun green laugh    ya shamrock laugh   shamrock green exactly   so no forest green would have been better  pool table green laugh   pool table green that's it  that's it  must be from your shark days  yes yes  but   i told you about the opening eh of the  the design art graduates show at the  vernissage took place at sharks in the pool hall and it was it was like stepping into another world  oh ya   have you been to that place  no no  it's in the foire boive   huh   they're interesting clients of laugh   environments aren't they   the the the   vernissage was in the private room at the back which has its own bar and a couple of pool tables  there's two different kinds of pool tables like a smaller one and a larger one  one's called one   snooker and boston  ya  and uh it was interesting actually watching it   i used to play pool a lot  ya   uh well i've played a little bit but nothing to really speak of  but it was fun to watch them play   but to walk in to this place  it's underground  it's in the basement  the ceiling's uh   low   ya  maybe they're not that low but the lighting is  right  the lighting comes down so i think it gives that uh feeling of low ceilings  very dark except for all these lit pool tables  there's smoke you know there's this because of the nightclub kind of atmosphere  and there's music and everybody's sort of playing and they're serious looking and almost gruesome  sounds like a movie  ya it was it was like in another world  i thought oh this has been going on  you know laugh   there was almost an air of toughness  and the vernissage was there  how could you stay   ya because they had the  the show was in the foire boive   was in some of the space which was actually a bar but there was no bar set up  i'll show you it  you know it's on the second floor and it's on the southwest corner  okay  and it was quite interesting  it was on two levels   and they had it displayed  i liked the display but but of course  they know uhh experts you know in display would tell you why it wasn't working  but le uh some of the lighting was quite poor on some of  the the items  mhh hmm 
Canada	" but i thought it was kind of it gave it  a different flavour  what were the things that were on display  their work from the year like uhm oh gosh  from from paintings to mechanisms to maquettes to  poetry on bark and like some of the uhm japanese rice paper  hmm   is it chinese rice paper  well that   word   there was  i'm not sure if it's japanese or chinese laugh   maybe it's just  but just   chinese   chinese cos theirs ya word one with the rice paddies  there's usually an innovative style to the projects  like there's thought forethought and there's societal environmental impact and blah you know all these sort of things  so they're interesting  they're not it's not they're not most they they're  they do exist but it's not mostly a piece of art that you look at and go oh isn't that beautiful and   although although  there's elements probably in there that are but usually they cause you to stop and examine and study and think and discuss  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and that's what's encouraged in the programs  thought provoking objects  mhh hmm  thought pieces  ya  interesting  trying to teach our designers to have a conscience  hmm  basically   i'm glad to hear somebody's going to have a conscience  ya  basically a designer affects his environment  his or her environment and you have to be very careful on the impact to society when you do that and that's what we teach our  designers  so i can rest assured that if i hire a designer from concordia i know i'm getting one of the best right  the president of our student association called us up this morning and uh they they've decided to do a logo for the department  and they've also decided that they're going to put out caps  they're going to sell caps for  cos this exhibit that they have at the year no "" end"" cost them a fortune like thousands and thousands of dollars  uh huh   and they're going to put out caps to sell and even a line of jackets  and like they're really going to go all out laugh   so i told the guy i said i want you to know i'm waiting for these caps cos i want to buy one laugh i'm not going to buy any  other cap  laugh   have do you have a company that  uh that makes caps  i don't know   why do you know one in mind  well there's uhh a fellow who uhm who  has a daughter at a child anyway at  greenvale school and he owns a company that makes caps  mh hmm   mh hmm  yup  and uh he does a lot of caps  well in fact uhm one of our neighbours was telling us they went down to p e i prince edward island: canadian province and they bought a hat for their son and when they got back they just happened to glance down at the uhm at the label and laugh  they realized it was laugh this fella fellow  who had made the hat  and apparently he he makes thousands and thousands of hats for all all kinds of organizations and whatnot  uh huh  and uh cough we were talking about getting hats for our school at one point for a fundraiser and uh they  people were coming up with various names and i said i think i have a name i think so knock at the door. an extracorpus speakers enters the room and communicates ( by miming?) with speaker a   come in  hello   pardon  yes but you can speak  it's okay  you don't wish to speak   word alright   okay   yes please  go ahead laugh   laugh   here you go sound of door shutting. extracorpus speaker leaves room.   we share  laugh we drank her water so she's going to eat up my salad dressing  anyway i believe that he donated uh like his  his way of donating to the school was to offer his services  and and so whatever they sold i think they just paid for the materials basically  so he didn't make any money off of it and whatever they sold was their profit so  uh huh   oh good  uhm  that's good  that's a very good re resource  to have volunteered  mh hmm   ya exactly  i know we were talking about him because anabelle  when we were camping uhm uh  you know anabelle is uhm the little girl who has alopecia  she has no hair  ya ya  and she was playing soccer   how is she doing by the way  oh there's only a twenty percent chance that her hair will ever grow back  how did they derive at that   at the twenty percent  ya   uhm i think it's just on past experience with patients that have alopecia totalis  mhh   uhm there are other forms of alopecia where the alopecia comes and goes but because she's lost all her body hair uhm uh   they she has been declared as alopecia totalis and only twenty percent of the cases have actually grown back hair  so   and sometimes only for only ah a very short period of time and then they lose it again  so in a way i'm hoping that if she does grow back hair that she that it it it   grows back ya and in one fell swoop and that  she doesn't have partial  because that would be harder to deal with  stays   mhh hmm   mhh   mhh  but uhm things haven't changed much  so it's almost two years now that she's uh that she's had it  anyway it's quite a problem now because she plays soccer  uhm she plays on the inter-city team for uh the tetras   and uhm there's a rule in inter-city soccer wa and i think it probably applies as well to uhm to house league soccer you're not allowed to wear a baseball cap  because the peak of the cap can be quite dangerous if  you're if you collide or somebody can get it in the eye or something  ohh   oh ya   so apparently they've had accidents   can't she wear a tam though like  no she wouldn't wear a tam  like you you also have to you also have to   realize that she's at an age now where she's going to have her own preferences  so what she did last year was she wore bandanas  those sort of western-looking bandanas  okay   and uhm that was okay but uhm i think she still felt a bit like a sore thumb and so what happened was uhm the girl that used to babysit her is quite a sewer one who sews and so she  designed a little kerchief kind of thing  it's like a bandana but it's shaped in somewhat of a triangular shape uhm out of black fabric  their colours are black and orange and yellow  so she came up with this black fabric and she designed this triangular shape that would be easy for them to wear  and uh they took it to the company that does the uniforms and they had the logo uh put on the bandana in the front  ahh   and uhm they had two of them made  one for her and one for a friend who like her friend who supports her  it happens to be the lady whose son it happens to be her daughter  uhm she is a really big supporter and she feels that if she's wearing one it's going to make the little girl with alopecia feel more comfortable  and so the whole team wants them now   so uhm ya ya  oh neat ya   so they went back and said they wanted more and the guy came up with some outrageous figure of eighteen dollars per bandana  i said that's crazy  so i suggested to them that maybe they go and see this guy who makes the caps and maybe he can do something   cos he was he was trying different designs last year to come up with something for her but nothing that he came up with she felt comfortable with but she really likes this bandana  so they all look like pirates wearing them but  but if i don't know it gives them that kind of mean edge that i suppose you need as a   as a competitive sports player you know  laugh   but i said what a wonderful thing  the whole team decided that they liked them and they wanted to wear them for her sake  and i think that really said something to the kids    uh that's wonderful   ya  that's so heartwarming  ya ya when they told me that i said wow what a good team  ya   but they've been playing together for a number of years  she's been playing inter-city now for at least two years  this is probably her third year  mhh hmm   is charlie in soccer  ya she starts tonight  where does she where is she playing  she plays uh in grier park which is  uh huh   she plays house league though  she doesn't play inter-city  i don't want her playing inter-city  what's what's the difference  i'd like carley to have been in it   it's actually is you're  playing against other teams from other cities  okay   right  so you could be playing lachine or you could be playing st laurent  right  and most of the games are at six six-thirty at night  right  so somebody's got to get home pick them up get  them in their uniforms and get them   to the to the game on time  huh   okay   how did you get into this  so   like where did you find out about it and   uh it's through the city  i can give you the names of the people but you're really late  ya   uhm you she  wouldn't be able to play on on the same team as  charlie though  i might do that   charlie 's playing in a league that's beyond her age  uhm she's supposed to be playing atom but we put her into mosquito  uhm carley would have to play atom  just co cos this is her fourth year playing and some of the kids she'd be playing atom with i felt she would probably be really bored with them  mhh hmm   so we decided to put her up into mosquito  and the girls that she'll be playing with are  they were on her ringette team last winter  mhh hmm  so they have a fairly cohesive group  mhh hmm  and uhm and they're all  pretty much they all really understand the game  and i think if if you were to put somebody in there that didn't know how to play i think they'd get a little creamed you know   ohh right right right  so she'd be better off to go into atom  and i can give you the n guy's name   uhm word there's a couple people  is henry too young   no   henry no no no  henry henry is five  five and a half  he's going to be six   ya he could play  he can play  no problem  they can both play   is it very expensive   inhale when i registered i think it was sixty or sixty-five  but then if  that was in february  if you late registered in march it was a little bit more  mhh  so i would think it might be around seventy or seventy-five  dollars is my guess   mhh hmm   the fellow who runs it is arnaud le jean   mhh hmm   and that's his phone number  do  there's also rob maur ic iano   and i'll get his number for you  he's probably the key person to speak with i would think  uhm so they   certainly carley would be in uh atom and in terms of henry i think he'd all i think he'd be in junior atom  atom   mhh hmm  uhm they were talking about an elite team which was an sort of like an inter-city team uhm at that age level and that's what they were thinking of putting  charlie on but i said no i'm not interested in that because you have to drive all over  word   i know  you you know it's  it's too much it's too much  so but certainly all the teams are forming have already been formed   yes  the teams have already been picked uhm but i spoke with with  rob last week cos what happened was for some reason they never got her into the mosquito list so she wasn't on the draft "
Canada	 hello  hello  hey  how ya you doing  not bad  good audible click   how are your squirrels  what  how are your squirrels  laugh no not bad   two words really active this afternoon   saw the chipmunk  uh huh  laugh he was uh it was just funny  it was it's well i mean of course it's normal but it was just like uh the same kind of like it was like  early evening and it's just like word remembered the same light that they had the last time i spotted them i just happened to look out the window and i see two squirrels and the chipmunk that are out   audible intake of breath and they were collecting like the ten million acorns that are in our backyard  ah okay   so cute  huh  i dunno don't know at one point the squirrel they spazzed out for like no reas i don't know what happened one of them like for absolutely no reason s   was like nothing within like a hundred anyway  there was nothing at all and all of a sudden they just went nuts  word   the one of them runs on a tree and he's like you know when they hang upside down word tree and he's got his nut in his mouth and he's flicking his tail and he's really like pissed off at something but i didn't see anything  laugh   m i'm like what's wrong with you  word so cute   oh it was just so cute watching   laugh he hurt his mou   he hurt the inside of his mouth on an acorn or something and got really ticked or  something   i know   he'd gotten all jumpy  s it's just like he'd been scared you know cos anyway cos i been watching him i did my ethogram there  oh and of course right now that i've done my ethogram  audible breath what do i get to see but i see one squirrel actually taking the time to kind of rest and self-groom himself  anyway  and s what do you mean well  like groom like  yeah  they groom themselves   obviously it's self-groom well no it could   be   no no they can well for example you know  like baboons or whatever groom each other   yeah two words baboons  would groom other people  laugh   well  just wander up to you and go hey what are you doing  laugh   it's a baboon behind you just grooming you you know  laugh   your hair it must do something   laugh   get the whole paddy fingers you know on your hair and you're just like what's going on you know  baboons just you know   laugh   baboon you groom get up there five bucks an hour  laugh   anyway so he's sitting there and he's like he's  you know i guess he had an itch or two and he starts like you know licking and scratching parts of his leg which of course would have been great to include in my ethogram but i hadn't really seen  it and i cou and i couldn't make it up cos i've never really seen  squirrels   uh okay   laugh   well you know they're kind of a nervous sort so you  coulda could have made some stuff up  you know word   well no cos the guy's an animal behaviourist right and like and they sugge on top of it they really suggested squirrels  okay  so the guy's had a he probably knows   the squirrel set of behaviours off by heart you know he probably had to learn it for his degree  or something   uh okay   laugh   word i popped up with this new  new behaviour should be like  cough   oh that's very interesting i didn't know they could build huts  w tell me more about it and i'd be like  uhh   they can build laugh starts they can build huts laugh ends squirrels building like two split levels in your backyard you know  laugh ah hang on word the other line okay  kay okay   hang on a sec pause while speaker a answers the other line, approximately fifteen to twenty seconds.   hello  hello  anyway so i didn't wanna want to   like i c i i did make up well didn't make up but i recalled some behaviours of my past which i kind of included but this woulda would have been great you know  all i got for grooming i that i  could put in was i saw one like start scratching itself like just had a spazzy itch there but this guy was like licking himself and all this  hmm   grooming  they seemed and it was also it just they li  like there was one of them th   i think he was a male  uh huh  well i no i make that guess i didn't see really any teats there but doesn't really matter   laugh   cos i saw a couple i saw a couple   which i knew were females because they had teats and and obviously they had been like they had had kids this year or whatever   uh okay   but this guy didn't seem to have anything but i mean it could have been like a virgin female but anyway  he seemed really calm though like unusually calm  mhm   snort   like he wasn't you know the way they  they quickly the way they eat their nuts like they're two or three words like  thr they're gonna going to  have indigestion like if we eat that fast   so it's sort of a slow day   laugh   but this guy was really taking his time anyway   it was just sort of it was sort of unusual  alright   so cute  huh  so that was it  and then the chipmunk was his usual audible breath man that routine eh  he gets out of his you know pops out of   his uh you know his hole   yeah  gets up on the on the little lawn chair that we have there looks around  he's audible click completely immobile  then he runs off grabs the nut never goes too far eh  okay  couple yards couple meters two words    well i mean chipmunks don't live in trees   i don't know  don't you i think you have like a  ground dwelling chipmunk or something  i don't know   well i don't know no i got the impression they didn't live in trees  cough   i thought they'd live on the ground   but i don't know i i sigh  sigh sounds like 'tfff' i dunno don't know    hm  anyway he never goes far from his hole  okay  and he comes running back  yeah  and then uhh real nervous-like cos he pops back into his thing  i saw him shove a few nuts like i saw him like he was definitely putting them in his pouches which was really cute  okay  and they kind of put it in like they're doing something in their mouth and then suddenly his it it's not   just his cheeks eh it's like his cheek and lower neck  like his whole   uh huh   anyways it's sort of interesting to imagine how big the pouch is because he shoves in two good nuts there and then he runs for his den  laugh the biggest part is getting the old cheeks through the doorway  like you think   like you think the squirrels are nervous but he's like a mess  oh really laugh   laugh like the squirrels they hang out in your backyard  a mess   this guy like he just emerges and goes back in and emerges and goes back in like you know  hmm  word that cat that cat you have next door that's you know  like he   that may that might do it  laugh   the that might be the   i thought maybe that was it a cat that'd uh you know that had somehow creeped into the uh to the  area but i didn't see anything  mm hmm  s it was  funny  hmm  so that's it   they're so sweet  shoulda should have had the   one of those we need one of those paint guns chase cats away with er not chase them away but  not paint guns you mean uh super soakers  hmm d yeah that's true they hate to get wet but a paint gun would be pretty effective too  that would kill the cat i think a paint gun  audible intake of breath aarh well not something really t not something that's you know   i think super soakers my friend ac  my friend a guy i kn in animal behaviour class we were  sposed supposed to get into a group and like we're supposed to discuss something that audible breath   something important   uh huh   but we didn't understand what it was so we ended up degenerating on animal laugh starts on animal topics  laugh ends   snort   and when clark was talking about the time he'd gone  audible intake of breath uh cat bowling and laugh   laugh oh i remember him telling about that   long laugh   and then word laugh   and um oh and then jonathan this other guy was like he heard him saying how the best way to train a cat was to get was to get like a super soaker gun  mm hmm  and he says what you do is he says it works for anything  you just you could just decide one day that there's one square foot of ground that you don't want your cat to stand in  laugh   laugh   for no reason at all  cos this is what he did and he put like you can even mark it off if you want  there's this one square foot of ground that you just don't want  th and everytime he gets there you squirt him with the uh with the gun  and he goes and it works laugh   laugh   then he goes w j well also and then they were suggesting things like yeah then every time you leave the house you have to put a cover over that piece of ground so he doesn't you know so if he steps on it like it was different cos if you stepped on it  anyway  okay   audible breath he was just saying it really worked and then you get this cat that basically will not go near  one square foot of ground for absolutely no reason you know  long laugh   cos he trained him with his two words    this was done ocourse of course   all in the name of science   oh ri of course  of course yeah   laugh   just wasn't because he didn't have anything better to do that day s   no   anyway  laugh   works great  huh  that's pretty cool s pretty cool  cos yeah cos th we were saying because the thing is you know when you don't want them standing on the table so like  see they don't you know they don't  realise they're doing anything wrong they're just walking  word   they're just cats   they're walking across your shelf they didn't realize that porcelain thing was valuable they just walked across it got in its way and pushed it out you know   mm hmm   sniff   across your what   word or two   and it pushed it out or pushed it word    no across your what   your shelves or  something what did i say  oh okay   you said shehbin or something   oh i meant shelves i think  okay  anyway   so that's it  cool  it was kind of funny  ah i'm really oh two well i saw i saw  the simpsons did you see it  ohh was on tonight eh no i didn't  ah i watched it for you  yeah  was i new one or an  old one   uh n   i think it was a new one  sideshow bob gets elected mayor  sideshow bob gets elected mayor  yeah he gets out he gets out  of prison and he gets elected mayor  and then they had this scene from a few good men   yeah  uhh oh   which one   because basically okay he gets elected mayor it's  ou simpsons   okay does homer vote for him   laugh he got a hundred percent votes   two or three words   laugh really  and he's like it was like  the the the vo votes finally came in it was like sideshow bob one hundred percent and then qu mayor quimby  one percent  and then the guy goes please note there's a one percent error   laugh two words   laugh   so then lisa suspects that   you don't scare me that could be anybody's ass  what  that's one time uh uh chief wiggum was uh   was threatening uh quimby  he said hey watch what you say i got pictures of you  he goes you don't scare me in that like ted kennedy type of   voice   ohh   you don't scare me those could be that could be anybody's ass  laugh   so i ws   it was pretty funny   anyway so he gets elected mayor and then he's tries to uh well he wants to build a f a freeway right across the simpsons' house   really   and they have seventy-two hours to evacuate and  in seventy-two hours if they're not out they blow up the house and   any remaining barts any remaining simpsons that are in there

used their names there   okay   and so and so lisa finally proved it and then they they so they brought him to court  and uh so they had this scene from a few good men where they   hafta have to breath where they ask him the lawyer's like breath did you rig the election and he goes no laugh   laugh   and then the lawyer's at like a loss and he's like well  kids help me you know  and there's like nothing they can say so then lisa says i have an idea and they start breath grilling him with questions and   he's like it's like it mimics the  um the a few good men scene  uh okay  the few good men so it was uh  and thank god lucky for me um  oh was lionel hutz the lawyer  start whisper i don't know end whisper   the guy th phil hartman  no i don't think so well maybe  coulda could have been

book  oh okay yeah  anyway   right after you sold it  well i managed to sell it  okay  and then anyway not long i know the next genetics course i think they had a better book   so thank god  anyway so i bought this new book and it's it's  really quite clear cos the other one was just frickin   fricking confusing it just you know i read it and i'm like what  but this one is like really straightforward  uh huh  i find it really quite easy to read anyway so far i do  anyway suffice it to say that um i'm feeling a lot more prepared than i was two words   okay than you were previously  yeah start whisper two or three words  end whisper some problems and i'm just   anyway i'm feeling better  cool  start whisper i'm feeling better about myself  end whisper   laugh   yeah   word have a good attitude a good outlook on life  yeah and i don't the important thing is  that i can't go to bed late  it's an open-book exam  yeah  so   maybe that'll go my way cos i'm you know i'm  starting to have experience with laugh starts open-book exams laugh ends   laugh   ah man i i dunno anyway  with any luck uh the moron count in the class is pretty high and word   laugh   you know considering those questions like   laugh what are you counting on a low curve  nu but you know it'll help boost my mark in  return   yeah   but you know what i mean like when when   there's like two chromosomes on the board and the guy goes and how many chromosomes do we have up here laugh   yeah exactly   it's like uhh sigh sounds like a horse grunt  laugh   uhh  and our s and like our in our   area   laugh the people in the back going  two two repetition for emphasis   laugh   it's like a wave starting in the back two two   laugh li yeah exactly   it's a wave sniff it's uh it's uh they give people flash cards and everything holding it up yawn   well it's in my n   scuse excuse me   where i'm sitting it's like all well all  the people i you know i'm with in the science club  so there's tina there's there's   um   so there's tina there's maya there's damon  there's michelle uhh who else  there's also elise but she's quiet  but notice we're all pretty somewhat rowdy people you know  mhmm  we're not rowdy but we'll answer you know what i laugh starts mean laugh ends   hah rowdy   i think the majority of the answer   i'll have to tell tina that you're a rowdy person  she's not rowdy but you should sniff i  dunno don't know   i dunno don't know if you   if you ever experienced  i'm not rowdy but   you know when you had a class full of people and like  everyone was like the teacher would ask a question and then everyone would be just like blank stares in front of them and like  oh yeah  you're like oh come on do i have to answer for all of you guys   long laugh   i was werr we were   in english class right and i told i   probly probably told you about this uh  clears throat miss walter who later became mrs. trent  i think the t students of the next year had to call her that or something   okay  and um anyway she was miss walter  swallow and her sister actually talked speaker says 'talked' not 'taught'  at school too  so uh so she wa ohh she was  just horrible too and uh  she was not a bad teacher but like just a horrible person like  one time we were having a movie we were having uhhhm horse grunt lord of the flies or something like that  okay  and i already seen the movie because i knew we were  gonna going to have to see it so i rented it one time   okay  figuring that i could ga i could get out of this class you know  figured okay i'll rent it i'll watch it and then sometime when we hafta have to watch it in class because there's no way you could watch it in one class you'd have watch it over two classes  i figured i   you could get out of class  i could get out of class and say ah i already watched this thing i'm gonna going to go like do mix  you know i'm gonna going to go mix   some songs together or something like that you know   but no  but no i had to sit and watch the movie  so i'm saying well i'm gonna going to  have some fun with this you know  so i got uh i got uh linda to bring in some uhh candy i brought in some popcorn and somebody else brought in drinks   so we're kinda kind of sittin  sitting around makin making  like you know a fun sort of type of movie thing out of it   and uh and then she oh afterwards like during the actual movie it was okay but then uh when the class was finished and we stopped the tape and we said okay you know we'll pick it up again tomorrow or whenever our next class was   uhm she took and she says all those people who bought things will have to stay  laugh   mlike i'm like   mlike i'm like oh god you know  uh treating this not taking this  seriously and uh and everything and all this crap so 
Canada	 word   start again  well laugh starts no it's okay you don't need to start again laugh ends laugh   okay   laugh anyway i got my plane ticket this last week  good  so i will be arriving at two fifty-two  two fifty-two  there you go  okay well i guess that it'll be sometime around then  yeah well i mean thereabouts  i'm i'm sure that we might have a little hold up here or maybe the winds will be from behind so they'll s  blow us all the way there  mm well you'll be lucky if that laugh starts  happens for sure word laugh ends   yeah right   anyway  that's cool  good  seventeenth  well there you go  for me it's not like screwing up any of your plans or anything  laugh yeah right  laugh alright silly question okay laugh   oh yeah   least i think it's a silly question  yeah oh w well that's good  that's good  everybody keeps asking me i guess they know that if they   wanna want to talk to me about stuff they mi's well might as well talk to me about stuff i'm interested in  laugh   oh yeah word   laugh   what does anyone talk to you about soccer  ahh well there's some stuff you know  laugh how's soccer going anyway  ohh not bad we we beat the nanaimo team today two nil so  so you're happy  and we were nice  we went up there  we got one of our dads as a he does  a limousine service so he had he we used one of his minibuses today  oh that's good  yeah it was fun  i dunno don't know it's good fun  we we beat em  them   ah i think we're gonna going to be on a cruise control for the rest of the league you know with that team cos there's the guy that's talking to the manager he's a nice guy  he says you know laugh starts we haven't scored three goals since we played you guys laugh ends   oh really laugh   laugh   mm hmm   laugh   havin having a hard time  if the whole morale's down  well sigh the um i mean it's  just that they're like that day i mean i guess i was right because on that the end of that day i   i felt maybe like a better coach but in my opinion they'd used up a lot of luck of theirs for the season they  kind of used up all of our bad luck laugh for the year like   mm hmm   so it was kind of confirmed  laugh   we just we just ahh we outplayed  em them so  the only thing is just it's i don't know i guess guys are more cruel or whatever but also when they're younger like that kind of possession three or four years ago would've been a nine nothing game not a two nothing  but the thing is is that the goaltenders get a lot better  and hm the defen like people just defensively get more useful so we spent the whole time pl outplaying them but we beat them too you know so it's alright but  mm hmm   okay   can be handled can be handled  they're gonna going to start calling you guys the steamrollers or something  hmm ah we're pretty good pretty awesome  laugh   i dunno don't know good  good kids i'm i'm lucky i got good word kids to work with but  quiet mumble starts that's fun quiet mumble ends   mm hmm   but anyways not too much new there  i'm kinda kind of i don't know   they're it's a year older than i should be coaching   i'm  yeah well you mentioned that last time you're better with younger kids   yeah  well i'm kind of feeling the same way  but it's good i guess   yeah well it's still an experience i  mean   yeah it is and it's gonna going to be a good one it's probably the only time i'll ever  p ever coach a

i think that   you have a really nice couch  laugh yeah   it's kinda kind of like  laugh   if that happens and there's a precedent then it's not so much  in the end of the evening that you even think that would bother him but it would be the kind of the follow up to that  mm hmm   laugh   and i knew that's what was gonna going to  be the thing  i knew it  uh so anyway there you go  that's fine   laugh   i mean i know i can survive  i'm sure you can  i got some stuff again too  anyways i kinda kind of i k  we kinda kind of chose the last little bit mumble starts three words stuff there it was kinda kind of funny mumble ends  yeah i think your dad and my dad will get along famously  ahh no yeah  i dunno don't know we'll see  you can see  you can reserve judgement on that call but  well i dunno don't know my dad tends to get along with everyone unless they're totally obtuse  yeah  yeah     well pronounced w your dad's cool i thought he was a pretty cool guy word he's got good taste anyway  and two words   laugh   well why because he likes you  of course  laugh   sarcastic mumble starts what a  two words sarcastic mumble ends   laugh   boy aren't we awfully sure  oh mom has uh passed judgment on you again  oh agai oh that's an every week thing isn't it  she says   oh no but this this one's good  she says that she really does like you now  oh good  i think she somewhat uh reconciled herself to the fact that she's just going to have to like you  oh laugh it's kind of a twist her arm thing  laugh   has she forgiven me for the uh recycled paper slash  ah false document two word   it's laugh   laugh   yeah well she sort of was i i  guess she spent about two weeks working on that one  yeah  and so this this week i was i was uh cleaning house and actually she comes up to me and goes well dina you know um you know i really like  stu but don't tell him i said so  and i went well pronounced w i don't think it will be a very bad thing if he knew that you liked him laugh   and she went well you have a point laugh   laugh oh well   so she word i'm i'm i'm  i'm so happy for that you have him and i'm sitting there going laugh starts well that's good laugh ends  where did this all come from   heh   i can r i think it's just cos my mother she sort of misses having another female in the house that she can you know talk to about silly things sometimes  ah ha  cos i mean you know with this she does have the twins and the twins don't talk to her very much at all 
Canada	 what do you mean not taking this seriously  you're watching a movie you bring popcorn there's an association here  that's what i thought i'm like hey what's wrong but you know this and that and everything else   what'd she say  what could she possibly say  audible breath   unless the popcorn would distract the students so they wouldn't be able to watch the movie  i dunno don't know   meh it's kinda kind of cruddy anyway  i think they made a remake of it which was much better  the book was very good  uhh the book was quite good  clears throat i think u-two made a song on the with a drawn out 'eee' sound boy album or the war album the boy album  they did  it's called uhh tall trees long shadows or something  really  there's a song on one of the u-two albums that is one of the chapter names in lord of the flies  cos we were reading at the same time and a friend of mine   picked up the uh picked up the album and i went hey wait a minute here  oh yeah cool   that's cool  tall trees long shadows or ahh something like that  anyway uh what i wanted to say t about this is she was sitting there and nobody felt like answering it was in the mi i   don forget what the circumstances were but  breath she asked a question and just like nobody said anything  ebody everybody just sat there like  i couldn't care less snort   yeah  and uh she goes well do i have to do all the work for you i mean come on let's have some answers here throw something back at me  oh no  and i turned around to rahul and i  rahul you ever met rahul   no  anyway rahul was uh was   your your real good kid you know  never caused any ruckus never caused any fuss or anything  i turned around to rahul and i'm going uh how bout  about a brick laugh   and he started to laugh and ohh i got that boy in some trouble  he got a little bit of a little bit of a   sayin saying to right there  oh really  oh yeah  you got him into trouble  yeah i got him into trouble laugh starts fr  cos he started to laugh so loud laugh ends   i was sitting in front of him but i managed to you know  kinda kind of keep it quiet   but he started to laugh like hell and uh  ah that reminds me of danielle used to always make me laugh in math class sniff   god  ah yeah   i would sit in front of her and it was mrs  malone who hated me laugh   oh really   what're your teachers like in st gerard unnatural pause, almost 10 seconds   audible breath what are they like  uhhm another unnatural pause, 4-5 seconds   it's a general question you know so like what were they like  were they really strict were there some of them that were  kinda kind of cool you know were they you know  some of them were kinda kind of  cool but i mean they had they had a protocol that they had to follow  ah okay  when i you know when we when they  walked into a room when they walked into a classroom we had to stand up  okay  and you couldn't not stand up and if you didn't you would be punished or you would whatever  you would be told look stand up ladies hello i'm here  you know and you had to st like they had to follow certain protocols or something had to  dress a certain way  uh huh clears throat   uhh so they you know they were told to maintain a certain   decorum   th i mean   in the classroom   yeah so i mean there was just in terms of the the strictness  but you can't point that out against any teacher because it was whether they agreed with it or not it's what they had to do   yeah  member i remember when mr novak  came in our geography teacher sniff   ah man poor guy   but he came in from a public school   yeah  and uh   anyway so for him it was like night and day you know i mean  yeah   at one point when you know we'd been bad right because  there was just there had been just too much talking in the study hall at one point and so we were like severely reprimanded right  sniff   and when mrs   oh god   like the whole cl the whole school  had to come in and for like a i dunno don't know  twenty-minute sit in of being super quiet for punishment sniff  laugh   hey sto   but i mean that's the way it was right i mean you have to  understand that's the way it was   that's yeah yeah   and uhh and so when mr novak   and of course all the faculty finds out that the kids and the students are in trouble  and mr novak found out the kids're in trouble you know they did something bad and mr novak 's like well were desks thrown out the window you know  laugh   uhh well did anyone jump out did you know  what happened something set on fire  it's like no no no they were being loud in study hall and he's like  that's it you know like  that's it you fools  so for him he was like telling us how it was just such a  you know like i mean of course in real life it's so silly but it's the way it was you know  yeah   whatever it gave a certain discipline i suppose  breath   or they tried to instill that in us i mean it's so  that's why when i got to school when you do  i think in general you get to secondary five you've kind of   you see b you realize all these stupid things are like irrelevant sort of thing  i mean you kind of realize i supppose their point to what they did  they instill something in you but  mm hmm  you realize that being quiet in study hall or whatev  like that kinda kind of punishment was just stupid you know it's not gonna going to get you anywhere  you have to really been bad it just you know what i mean  and so sort of a   start whisper but anyway end whisper   so mrs ma mal malone  oh my math teacher  so danielle was sittin sitting  back of me and she hates uh m   so mrs i think mrs malone  hated us cos we were wiseasses  laugh   and  ah ya you smartass people  laugh and uh and  danielle hated mrs malone and anyway and i was just sort of like  she was a good math teacher though i'll give her that she was a good math teacher but on a personality level we didn't  okay   yeah cos there's i  betcha bet you that some people that can go with the flow sort of like what they're  sposed supposed to do   you know   she tried to revel in the fact that she had the power over you  oh yeah  but i mean she was a good math teacher and that's all that counted  but anyway danielle couldn't stand her sniff   okay  so danielle oh it was just like classic when she when she came in class she was she kind of  she had this paper but she got this habit into  wearing dangling a paperclip off her lips   kinda kind of like a cigarette you know   who   it was just barely hangin  hanging there  just a paperclip a coloured paperclip   who was this   danielle   okay   danielle   danielle was just back of me  yeah  she had this paperclip in her mouth and then w mrs  malone would be talking whatever and danielle would crack these wiseass comments  laugh and of course you're the only one to hear them  i'm the only  she's like she's talking to me she's just looking  at mrs malone and she's talking just sort of through her lips like that spoken in the manner mentioned   uh huh  and she'd just and she'd say  something and i was like stifled laugh   it's the same thing as through through   your lips it was like how bout about   a brick you know sort of thing like that   speaking through her lips yeah   word really and she but she'd   sorta sort of talk like that and she had the paperclip there and she'd laugh like hu hu hu huh stops talking through her lips   laugh she's like she was like beavis   you should have seen her laughing right   she was just looking straight ahead she had this like fixed facial expression with the thing hangin hanging  out of her and she's like speaking through lips  howtabrick how about a brick you know and then i'd be like  pretending to stifle a laugh and then she'd be like hu hu hu huh  and then who'd get in trouble right me laugh   laugh   you obviously   so i got threatened one day that i'd be kicked  breath   you one day one day evie tsk i predict that you will get kicked out of c&eacute;gep two-year program completed after highschool for post-secondary preparation laugh   three or four words i'll get kicked   kicked out of a c&eacute;gep math class  out of c&eacute;gep   don't ask me why  i just kinda kind of looked at her and went uh huh do you laugh   you gotta got to be pretty bad to get kicked out of a c&eacute;gep math class don't you >  laugh just sort of like la la it was sort of an irrelevant strep   it was just so funny you know th   every so often danielle and breath   later on like months later would just sit by and she goes   starts talking through her lips i predict laugh   and of course then of course i start laughing again   long cackling laugh did she say this  in front of everybody   n no it was just like  they w these're quiet comments to me  oh no no no i mean did she say this yo uh  sh i predict that   oh it was in front of everyone yeah  oh really  yeah  well i predict that you're probly probably  right   i was just sort of like okay whatever  laugh   well we'll see i guess   indifference total indifference  well what do you want me to what do you say  to that like it's not really that ba   you know it's just sort of like okay laugh   mm hmm   anyway so and i know the   anyway just start laugh you feel like you're end laugh getting in trouble when you're laughing at someone laugh   cos the joke that someone else made  mm hmm  i remember the one time in english class cos   w i we'd always sit up front  mm hmm  second row up front  yeah  anyway cos we couldn't really get in trouble there  cos cos they wouldn't check you out they wouldn't keep a close eye on you if you were in the second row because they figure you were too close to do anything mischievous so they were scopin  scoping out the back row all the morons who wanna  want to sit in the back to keep outta out of the teacher's attention  okay   laugh   that's what they were always scopin  scoping for the trouble makers you know  uh huh   so me and danielle would get away with everything up front you know laugh   really  it's that selective view  front and centre bang  so th is tha     yeah   selective view it's  and i just remember once it was just so i don't think i can explain it to you but it we laughed so  and i it was in uh oh like did you ever have the books called the wordly wise   mmm   they were english books it's just to increase your vocabulary right so you had this list of new words you had to learn  you had to look up the words in the dictionary then you had to use these words in sentences and all that kin you know that crap  mkay okay   just to learn sniff new words  yeah  and one of the words i don't know what it had to do it had to do with   so mrs malo mrs stockman  who actually knows kevin boers very well at the restaurant but   sort of ve you know she's an english t and sort of into drama and very theatrical and she was like  and this one word had to do with sort of something to do with medieval times maybe in swordfights or something  so she was acting out this whole swordfight or something and me and danielle are just crackin cracking  just these stupid comments you know   snort   and i'm going start whisper oh can you imagine you know they the guy sort of you know  they're like the guy   like for example they're having a swordfight and one guy's not looking what he's doing and he accidentally lobs off the head of his opponent right  uh huh  a and it was i  dunno don't know how that came up and i was like ah wouldn't that be funny and then danielle just goes yeah and then the  gu and then have a nice day the teacher goes have a nice day   and then from and then for some  reason it was just too funny  it was like we just started laughing like  five or six words but we had to be quiet 
Canada	 long breath/snort   so it makes it even funnier  snort   and so then pretending to stifle a laugh   yeah ya you smartasses  i've never laughed so hard and then we had to keep it quiet like pretending to stifle a laugh   and then i'm starting to cry start laugh to the point where  end laugh i just  and then after a while mrs stockman 's like you know i'm going girls what you know what what's so funny  what's going on here  and sigh i almost ran out of class cos it was just so  laugh   and at and at one point   i just had to bury my head in my book and start laughing and like i had my two words   long hyena laugh everyone else's like  she's lost it  she's gone over the edge   they don't know what it was cos it was  just a quiet just a little   and it was so silly on to   it was just so stupid a but it was so funny i guess we could see the picture in our head  it was just so asinine and it was ah   and i was crying and to the point where you know  and i couldn't look at danielle   okay  cos whenever  and i could sometimes feel her looking at me and the i  wo it would just put me back into spasms of laughter you know and so that that was a pretty bad laugh   well it was funny but sigh anyway   quite a difference in our school  yeah  s'girl this girl falls asleep on her desk right our english teacher to takes  a this was uh mr stark uh someone was about to go wake her up and he says no no no let her sleep she's probly  probably had a tough night or something you know like starts laugh so she s they just let her   sleep through the rest of the class you know  oh no oh no   she's uh and then   we had this one math teacher who was uh who was known to have like he was a very good math teacher and and   a certain amount of strict but he was known to have   quite a temper so you didn't dick around you know  yeah  so we'd always cheat right at the beginning of the exam  because he always relied upon his uh upon his uh   his reputation  right  so for the first half of the exam he'd be sittn  sitting there readin reading  not payin paying attention to anything at all  and then the last half of the exam he'd take and he'd uh he'd uh  you know like he'd look around and watch people when they were done and everything like that breath tell 'em   them okay you can leave you know  yeah  he'd make a few people stay until like about half the class was done and then he'd say okay you can leave the rest of you  just uh just finish up your exam and everything  and so like at the beginning of the exam we'd just turn to all the hard questions and do them and look back and forth and  like i'd do one question and my friend would do another one  and we'd take and we'd switch our papers back and forth from de yeah oh yeah fr   no way long and drawn out   switch our papers back and forth from desk to desk we'd look at what the other person had done just so you know and then we'd we'd go and do the the we'd switch back and we'd do the problem that we'd just seen the other person do breath and if we got the same answer we just kinda kind of look over and you know like this laugh starts we kinda  kind of hold our tests up to each other it was so funny  laugh ends   laugh word   it was so hilarious because you knew that like all the tough ones were gonna going to be at the end and all the easy ones're gonna going to be at the beginning so  snort   you know you just took and uh you did   all t all the tough ones at the end and then the end of the exam you did the easy ones so it was pretty   i only i only  switched exams once in c&eacute;gep when when   one of the guys laugh starts one guy laugh ends  actually passed out in class cos he he i guess he'd been studying two or three days in a row and he literally had not been sleeping or something  uh huh  and it got it finally got to the midterm and he literally i think he passed out in class or he   really wow   like he was an old sort of  laugh   and for the teacher  like course of course they had to take him out cos this is an unusual situation so the teacher you know take him start whisper two words  end whisper go and she takes him out  and so we're all like we're now in an empty classroom i just word   it's li laugh most people are stunned  most people are stunned   three words it's like oh well   it's a time to act   word what's go and then ah teri w whadya   what did you get for number three laugh    laugh   and then like so i grab this test like okay yeah oh no  teri she made a mistake groan so anyway   at first it's actually the guy that we met i dunno   don't know if you remember he's in computer science so  we met him in the we saw him in the uh at the airport at concordia a little while ago with you me and jesse   mmm  was a guy blond shortish guy came by and i introduced you his name was ben but we named him bender   huh you just name people other things really  well no cos he never showed up to calculus laugh starts  class laugh ends   he got that cos he only showed up for six hours of his calculus term  so why did that give him the name bender   because john bender character from the movie the breakfast club never went to class four or five words    uh okay huh   i didn't i'll be fair for this i  dunno don't know did didn't see enough of the film to really  okay so  yeah that's but that's that's true  anything that happens anything like that that happens you have to take advantage of it  yeah  you know  and never put your name on your exam until you're done   my god  oh yeah ohh i di well you know  how stupid can you be you know  like you just don't put your name on it  that's funny they could pass it out and then they  exactly and even if even if  something comes down or somebody says something you know  and they say oh let's see your exam and you go here you know there it is ahem and unless you got a whole lotta  lot of essay questions and you got this really flowery handwriting you know  right  it's uh it's you know it's it's the same   sorta sort of thing   so uh but some of the laugh   there were a few things like that you know the teacher has to leave the room or there's a call for the teacher or something like that   soon as they close the door it's like number two  they must've known like i mean they're not idiots i mean   no of course not  i mean that was a different  i guess she had to take that into consideration  so funny  i know there was one girl i prolly probably   told you this before but you know molly   mr ramsey the guy who taught you economics   oh tim ramsey   tim ramsey well his daughter marlene  was in my class  yeah   uh huh  anyway but anyway and i  probly probably told you this before but she used to often fall asleep in class but she had like a   oh you told me about her she had some sort of  bit of a physical thing  she had she had medical  cond yeah   and so literally she would she would  pass out for several classes  it was the only prolly probably  the only person that could well get away with it i mean she ha i mean i think i all the teachers   had been notified or whatever that she had something  yeah   breath she would just i guess she couldn't   was she an insomniac maybe i don't know  mm hmm   but she i don't think she   could fall asleep before maybe two in the morning  oh wow  and when you're in high school   yeah it's kinda kind of rough  like now you know it's just like yeah you know so what   laugh half the time i don't go to bed until three   yeah laugh that's what time i usually go to sleep yeah   you know whatever  but it was like  some of us are idiots and stay up till seven  laugh but  but we won't go into that  no we won't  we won't go there   anyway but she so she conked out for like several classes breath   no one'd ever say anything  laugh   i w i went to pedro 's office today because i had the new uh i had the the   contracts drawn up and i also had the the  s labels  so i got the labels done and they didn't come out too bad  good  but i gotta got to change the uh i gotta got to change   the uhhh the company uhh font  the n m one fifty-six font because it's just defeated sigh  it's just not happenin happening   i went for a light like a light font  not a heavy not heavy letters clears throat  i went for light letters and it's ju   so it would look different than the heavy letters that are below it  just doesn't work  bad idea  yeah now i gotta got to take and redo them  i gotta got to get in touch with uh  benjamin and see what's uh breath and see if  i can get some more of those labels cos i can't seem to find them  those diskette labels can't seem to find them anywhere so   so there it is  but uh but uh what was my point of this  so i made those and oh yeah okay   word   s so i dropped by uhh pricewaterhouse name of accounting company today and i was by the mailroom and i just i just knew jolene  's extension so i punched her up and uh she goes hello and i said hey yo  j what's up and laugh and there was just this pause  i'm like jolene yeah it's richard i'm at the mailroom she's like oh like laugh   laugh   it was like you know it was uh  so i just said do you want me to take and uh leave this  you know just leave this envelope or do you have time to come down and she said she was busy so i just put it in an envelope  laugh she probably after that comment she probably couldn't face you you know  put one of   laugh exactly  that richard dawson i don't know he's a bit weird  dontcha don't you think   it it's he he's a he's   got that black lingo you know he talks that way  but uh i don't know i don't know i just i'm just gonna going to try and be sickeningly nice to jolene and just you know i just won't care even if she's   if you're sickeningly nice to her that's probably going to irritate her even more  that's the key  no but i mean like even if she's snotty i'm just  gonna going to be really nice but i'm not  like i'm just gonna going to be short and just say here take this to pedro oh you have something for me good i'll be nice and pleasant and everything like that and if she's not nice back well you know i i'll i i'll i won't be talking to her long enough to really notice you know  yeah  and i and at the end if she wants to be nice then fine you know  if she doesn't then you know well what can you do  no it's a good policy   because if she is deliberately trying to be mean on the off-hand chance then your pleasantness is gonna going to  drive her crazy  yeah because i'm just not you know   whatever she says i'm just you know   be like yeah okay fine you know not gonna   going to be uh not gonna going to  be affected   but no i don't think she goes out of her way to be mean i think she's just not a  no yeah  she not a happy dancing person by nature so  which is too bad   laugh   so anyway business went pretty well today actually  i talked to this guy the guy who's makes the decisions on this he came  i went to see james and

like cos that was classic  i i had a my dean actually had a  near brush with mono mononucleosis   yeah  she had this flu bug that uh was having her sleepy in twenty hours out of twenty-four  hmm  and

especially just start of like finals laugh   ah   yeah  that does not help at all heavy intake of breath   anyway so i see you're going to pronounced 'goina' grey cup  well maybe   maybe maybe maybe

of big  laugh   huh  have to be pretty big pictures to need those envelopes  well   only the medium-size ones  they don't need the like it's not full eight by eleven you know   incredible portrait size  word   you can put this up on your t v and just you know   no it's my legs are sore  can you guys hear me talking in there  guess not   word we   i was cos i'm recording this now  and i wanted to know like if it came out through the speaker in the family room  is everyone gonna going to hear us  no no   i know i had kraft dinner now where is it   there it is   ohh   sigh   do you only have two final exams  mm hmm  oh lucky you  hey   well the next semester after that i have three  i have four caroline   and then after i have four  okay i knew i thought  i had beans  now where in the hell are they   you having beans and macaroni  well i'm not gonna going to eat all the macs macaroni   kay okay i guess i don't have any beans  oh well i'm havin having  macs macaroni   i can't have macs macaroni i've no milk  so get some  yeah but i'm on the phone with you which means sigh  i can't do both at the same time  get somebody else to go  well no we've decided to stop sharing milk  why  cos i'm the one that drinks the most and jessie  wants to go back to drinking two percent and stephanie hardly drinks any so   stef's not gonna going to  drink any milk at all i'm gonna going to have my milk and jess's gonna going to have her milk  uhh   oh i see  yeah  five mumbled words   yeah  kay okay oh i don't have p  oh yes i do  okay  for mom and dad for their stockings and for christmas presents  do you have yo their lists there or do you want me to go get mine  uhh  one second  i'm writing notes at the same time as we're talking  laugh   notes that i've missed  uhm   well i have it here  kay okay   actually i made i had some ideas for mom for her stocking  well the stocking i'm gonna going to   put socks and stuff  well this is like a communal effort isn't it  yeah put socks  uhh  and that uh basting brush thing that she was talking  bout about but you didn't know what what  what it was  yeah yeah i know what it is now  but yeah  uhm what other uh like  vaseline and like ah portable things for when she's skiing  okay   what about dad too  yes   get dad one too   yeah   like a chapstick though for dad cos he doesn't like vaseline  yeah  i was sitting in history class thinking about this  laugh   uhm and i was thinking of getting like exercise socks for dad  yeah that's good  uhm i came up with another  oh yeah at school there imaginus poster and print store  is there  oh yeah  and what about getting like a little monet print for mom  they're just five bucks  yeah  kay okay   that's good   ah-kay okay   uh my elbow   you have to start doing online shopping  i haven't done any yet  i haven't done any  i've been looking around though like  yeah  i haven't even done that laugh   unclear mumble   uhm would you wanna want to  what sh are we gonna get like   communal presents for mom for christmas and just split it all  after  i dunno don't know what do you think  that's probably the best idea  yeah  like what did what did she r     i don't have the list in front of me so what did she really want  word   we can prob you know we can probably stick candles in her stocking  yeah  okay mommy's list  uhm socks off-white turtleneck  kay okay   uhm i can buy the off-white turtleneck for  myself at fifty percent off at the  gap   sh   she didn't like them  she doesn't  well she said they were too expensive for the quality  it's what she said  but i don't know where else we can get them  i'm sure actually places all over have turtlenecks  mm hmm   but that's probably the best idea cos then   she wanted poison perfume  well kay okay the  the poison and the l'air du temps we'll get from dad  what do you mean dad will get her  yeah like it'll be from dad  co cos it's  it's a fortune caroline   okay she wants black  stretch pants  that's it  that's it   and candles   and candles   oh boy  so we can get her everything  yeah  well why don't we get her then either the l   poison or the l'air du temps and dad'll get her the other one  okay  and do you wanna want to  stick to stretch pants in the stocking as well 
Canada	 good  to ge that way we can get a good   we can get someone who's selling it and who's using it that way make all these other people a whole lot simpler that i go to  i can say well just get in touch with this person you know they're one of our resellers see what they think of it   but those other people i don't think i don't think    i think rory 'll go for it cough like i have to talk to the guy but i think they'll uh they'll uh   go for it speaker b reads job description aloud   so that's uh you know it sounds it sounds  really cool  just a question of getting the appropriate cover letter  good  yep and getting one to benjamin and getting one to the y for computer things  laugh   and uh this guy john who i who i  met today wants to take and get involved with uh large companies  in the i in exchange of uh   of data you know from like the l  the main office to the little small subsidiary and getting all the relevant product information and everything like that so i dunno   don't know   i'm not quite familiar with what he's talking about right now but we're going to be meeting about it next week so  huh  so it could be pretty cool we'll have to see about that  i wish pedro would finish up his pharmafree thing  i got a bunch of stuff for him to do  actually   laugh   actually i wonder if it's worthwhile i mean like i know all these people want programs done and everything like t   like i know three people right now that need programmers to do things for them  i wonder if it's worthwhile like advertising and finding you know programmers  cos remember we tried that up at the club tryin  trying to find programmers and everything and it was like pulling teeth  laugh   trying to find anyone who was good  i mean most of the people who are good are employed   course of course   s so i wonder if maybe it's worthwhile getting in touch with pedro 's the people he knows in his class and finding out like okay how much time do you have outside of  cos i know pedro 's got a project but i'm sure marc  's not doing anything outside of what he's doing at work   and pedro 's got some other friends that i don't think at least what he what he you know from what he   tells me i don't think they're involved in other projects   maybe i should try and you know tap that resource a bit  it's worth a try  yeah long pause, about eight - nine seconds   okay  so what are you doing i hear some tapping  sorry it's my calculator  oh okay  have you figured out how to use that big old   but it's there's no like you can't  go outside because there's nothing there's no  stairs or anything  okay  it used to be a fire exit  laugh   and he got caught in the screen door in there  okay  so it was fine cos he was like dying  but somehow he got out probably the same way he got in  audible inhale   and now he's buzzin buzzing  around like a little fly laugh   yeah he's gonna going to you know land on your food and lay eggs and before you know it you'll have lots of them   no because all my food is put away very well  mkay okay   so and i don't uh the only food i have  in my room is uhm like canned stuff  mm hmm  and stuff in my fridge  mkay okay   and it's all in little baggies and stuff cos  i just have like a fetish about  ahh   laugh   three words   you have a fetish about plastic things i see laugh    no laugh plastic things  about food being out in the open i hate that  laugh   cos i think about bugs all the time landing on it and  blech  laugh   freaks me out   so   and i have done absolutely no studying tonight  oh no well  no cos after i got off the phone with you then mandy  called me then carol called me then my sister called me  mm   so i haven't accomplished very much  laugh   except half of a grocery list  well you know that's you know you're   doing the important things first right laugh   that's right food first  sniff i know what you mean  uhh i tried to study but it doesn't work  ah i hate it laugh i said to   you have that exam tomorrow eh  yeah but the exam tomorrow is it's  neuropsychology  it's uhm it's to do with brain cells  and stuff like that nerve neurons and stuff  the thing is i've already i've done that  in most of my other biology classes and stuff like that breath    mm hmm   so all i have to do is really read the book and it's  i think it's thirty questions multiple choice  it's you know psych is not   ts not that's could be it's not that bad  it's not the hardest subject and  no i have social social psych and i really like it's my favourite class  mm hmm yeah   and seeing as i've you know i've already  done most of the stuff in other classes it's not hard  i know most of it already before the teacher even brought it up he says well now we're gonna going to talk about action potential breath   and i'm thinking okay i've already taken you know four courses on this or whatever and one of them was actually so in depth that you know everybody was lost by the second class  so it's nothing new nothing seriously hard what can i do  well that's good  yeah my roommate called and said alright we're gonna  going to go out i'm like okay sure you know laugh   so you're gonna going to go out tonight  well i sort of decided that you know noisy sigh what the hell why not  i was gonna going to ex   use this as an excuse to stay home and study but seeing as i'm not gonna going to study anyway i might as well go out breath   and since it's my birthday people are gonna going to buy me free beer or you know how you can get free beer  what time is your exam at tomorrow  it's uh one fifteen  oh that's not bad  i have class from eleven forty-five till one though   yeah still not bad though  and i can also skip it though so laugh   exactly   yeah no big deal  we'll see what happens laugh   see what time i wake up tomorrow  i'm certainly not gonna going to get drunk tonight sniff   what  i s i'm certainly not   gonna going to get drunk tonight  no i'm not planning on getting drunk till after my birthday so  but   ahh well it's coming up isn't it  well in november  mm hmm fourteenth right  yeah again  laugh   i have a memory for numbers  except your telephone number i had trouble two words  sigh   where did y w did you   remember it  no  i was gonna going to say holy  shit   no first of all i was thinking look for a telephone bill it might be on there and all of a sudden no no no that telephone bill hasn't come in yet laugh you know  and all of a sudden wait a minute w how  can i get  so i called the operator the six one three operator and got your number  oh really  yeah  oh you shoulda should have waited a little while cos i woulda would have called you back  inhale yeah well i didn't know if you'd get annoyed at me or angry or whatever because laugh   i figured that had happened  and uh my landlady's uh phone rang  mkay okay   and i thought hmm i wonder if that's damon cos you had my old number  mkay okay   and i wondered if you would phone my old number cos you couldn't find my new one   but i didn't wanna want to answer her phone because   i didn't have your old number  you didn't  no  oh yeah i think you did  why how long has it been since you had this number  well since like oh maybe you didn't   since september no you probably didn't have my old number  no no but i guess you gave me the address and you said when i get my new phone number i'll call you laugh okay  yeah   alrighty then  laugh   uhm guess how much my phone bill was speaking of phone bills  how much  just try and guess  eighty-five  put a one in front of that and you got it  are you serious  uh huh  ouch  and uh but that was with my installation and hook up fee  okay  so that was only about seventy dollars though at the most  so it was a hundred and fifteen laugh in telephone calls  yeah and the only place i called   mm hmm  is my sister in kingston   yeah  my parents at home and a couple of my friends at home   mkay okay   and uh jon in ottawa a guy i used to work  with   yeah   and uh my friend in beachburg town in ontario  gina in beachburg   and i phoned you twice but they were only for like i  dunno don't know really cheap  like a dollar one was a dollar or something  yeah because when you call you talk to me for two minutes and then i called you back laugh   no that was that that one hasn't  come up yet cos that was just a little while ago  oh boy laugh   yeah so you're gonna going to get a doozer of a pho phone bill  seriously   i can imagine   but that's a lot of money  yes it is  that's almost three hundred bucks  so i told my mom she called me tonight and left a message on my machine i called her back and i said hi i can't talk my phone bill was a hundred and eighty-five dollars and i really can't afford another phone bill like that so uhm unless there's something you really need to tell me i'll talk to you tomorrow night  laugh   laugh   i'm serious that's what i said  and she said okay well i was just wondering if t   wo er to ask if you were coming home this weekend  and i said yeah and she said how's your classes going and i said good   and i said so i'll talk to you tomorrow night  bye laugh   yeah exactly  she said okay i'll call you tomorrow then i said  she said when  i said doesn't matter i'll be home all night so  oh geez laugh   mmhmm  ah sounds expensive laugh   but i'm not phoning home anymore unless i really need to  yeah well that's the way to do it  my sister called me tonight so i have to call her next time but i'm calling her on friday from home laugh   mm hmm  so   snort   then it won't cost us either of us  anything  good thing to do  geez laugh   but uhm oh i got a beep  hold on   no prob problem  speaker b answers other line, pause for eight seconds; speaker a starts talking before speaker b comes back   interesting how people   what  nothing  how you doin doing   good how're you  laugh   what were you sayin saying    my roommate just walked in  ahh i see  that was dana she's

mm hmm  how you doin doing   i'm doin doing pretty good actually  good  yeah  d   cos uhm he talked to my mom yesterday eh  mkay okay   and okay i talked to my mom on sunday and i told her that i wanted to go down to windsor when he came home in november for a couple weeks  yeah mm hmm   well two weeks actually  cos his parents o his whole family   was having like a christmas for him  okay  cos he won't be home for christmas  right  and so i wanna want to go  ho go down there on a weekend so i wouldn't miss any school or anything but on a weekend  and like spend some time with his family meet his family cos i've never met them  okay  and then come back  aright all right   and my mom basically said well i'll think about it and uh we'll talk about it later i don't want to talk about it right now  and i said all right fine  okay  and thought to myself i don't really care what you say cos i'm going anyways because i wanna want to meet his family and you know like i'm on my own now there's not a hell of a lot you can do about it  but i wasn't gonna going to say that cos  and then my mom   you can get in trouble for that 
Canada	 uhm   yeah we'll get dad to get her the perfume   we'll get her the stretch pants turtleneck and sweatshirt  like it's a dark  oops i can't spell sweat shirt  sweatshirt   it's a dark grey sweatshirt  mm hm   and i only s i've oh  the mom one it's like a kind of a turquoise background with little flowers on it  yeah   like the mom s no like the mom is kind of a dark turquoisey colour with little flowers on it on the like on top of the turquoise  and it says mom   yeah  well it says concordia university mom   uhm   i dunno don't know you decide  well is there any way you could come down here to see them  like they're hanging in the window so you don't have to come down when the bookstore is open  tsk it's only at the bookstore  yeah down downtown   downtown bookstore  like if you're ever downtown like this weekend or sometime go by the school and they're hanging in the window  tsk okay  like the corner of uh de maisonneuve and guy  you know de maisonneuve and   and they're fifty bucks each  yeah  yikes  that's the problem like do we just get for mom for both  like the other thing is dad's birthday  yeah  and but the other  th like do we wanna want to  get them for both cos that could be   daddy dad's getting dad wants  jeans  yeah  for he pe words   his birthday is such a problem being so close   okay we've done mom maybe the sweatshirt we'll worry about that   word daddy royal copenhagen he needs two bottles  yeah  so we can get him that  yeah  so it's no problem   yeah   cos it's not very expensive it's like twenty-five bucks  for two or each   for one   okay  so  that's what dad'll get for   what  his birthday  uhm  cos uh like if we're getting mom  i think we should get one him for his birthday and one for christmas  okay   and then jeans for christams  well i guess so   like what you know what you should probably do is make up like a one of those gift  f certificates from the gap made up  yeah  and s and just so he can go and try on all the different kinds that he wants  yep  and that way do you get the thirty percent off  yep  awesome  mm hmm  jeans for christmas and what about these sweatshirts  i'll get him uh i guess a fifty dollar certificate  cos some jeans are like forty-eight and that would have to pay a bit of money for tights does that matter  okay   no no no  cos i'll only pay thirty bucks up for it  there's that is a good idea  or fifteen i'll pay the other ha i'll pay the other   well then do you wanna want to  give me the money  i don't have it right now  i'll have to wait till i get paid again  okay  well i'm not doing all my christmas shopping till my next paycheck  okay laugh   my next paycheck is really big so sigh  ..  unclear mumble   so i'll sleep in class word   what are we gonna going to do about the sweatshirts  forget about them  w well i dunno   don't know   i mean  they're fifty bucks each  so much  i know   but then what else could we get mom  oh she's getting quite a bit now  that's true that's true   that's enough  so scratch the sweatshirts maybe for another time  yeah  okay what else okay for dad  for   what about their their   anniversary like   oh that's in april laugh   oh like a the matching ones you mean  yeah  for there's an idea   okay  that's good  yeah   and i was thinking actually a friend of mine is doing this  like just taking a picture of her and her sisters  what   yeah  and giving that to their p her  brother for her birthday or for christmas or something like that cos her parents are divorced but uhm like we could take a picture of just the two of us and g give that to mom and dad as well for their anniversary  cos we don't have time to do it before christmas  that's good   that's a good one too  like formally dressed and sitting i don't know somewhere  mm hmm  i don't know where we'd sit laugh   well we'd go to a uh place wouldn't we  no like take the picture with my camera  okay  i don't know where we could sit though  i'm thinking of somewhere probably at home like either the  living room or the family room   anyways we can worry about that later  uhm dad's stocking  yeah  kay okay so far i've written chapstick and socks  and i got him you know that change thing he has  yeah   i got him another one  yeah   that was like three bucks  i wanna want to put chocolate in his  yeah he loves chocolate  that's a good idea  i know   oh and i thought al also like  a   like toblerone or something  yeah  oh good idea  yeah  uhm you know he's been on it  going on   ha did you see the truck  yeah he brought it home today  yeah i know  i didn't know if you saw it   two words   yeah  i'm thinking of getting him like a little toy truck just for as a joke  yeah i guess   a little toy pick up truck stick  in his stocking  laugh   oh you know what we should do  what  we should uh put it th wrap up a pair of keys and stick those in uh in in his stocking with a note attached saying now you've gotta  got to find the truck   or now you've gotta got to wait for the truck or the truck is coming or something like that  okay we might have it by then you know  sigh   it's true  i can't believe he's gonna going to   buy a truck   he might

Canada	 what  you can get in trouble for that  that's right  anyways when ryan talked to my mom yesterday they had like pretty lengthy talk i guess and uh   like my mom doesn't like ryan   mm hmm  but i think she's gonna going to  start liking him when he gets back   really   yeah cos i think that she kinda kind of   hit a turning point yesterday when she was talking to him  because they were talking and uh my mom told him to make sure he took good care of me when he took me to windsor for the weekend  good  but she hadn't said anything to me about whether i could go or not  well obviously it's yes  she's obviously come to the conclusion that i'm going anyway so   yeah   she also talked to him about like what he's   gonna going to do when he gets out of the military and stuff and how she really didn't want me to marry someone in the military because like i didn't know what the military was like and she didn't really want me to find out what it was like and just all this kinda  kind of stuff  anyways they talked for a while and ryan said that like ryan used to think ryan used to hate my mom   mkay okay   like she was a real bitch  and that's why they never got along because he hardly ever talked to her because he thought she was a bitch  mkay okay   and then so therefore she thought he was an asshole so it just kinda kind of went both ways right  ah geez   but um now ryan said that he realizes that my mom is just like expects a lot out of people  mm hmm  like she doesn't expect people to sit on their ass and do nothing and say yeah this is life  like she expects them to go off and do things with their life  yeah you grab them by the balls and off you go  yeah and uh she expects a lot of people like she expects a lot of me and she expects a lot of my sister and she expects a lot of her boyfriends too right  and uh he said that he used to like think that that was wrong because it's like my life and i should be able to decide what i'm going to do with it  okay  but he said he said now he realizes that you know like i'm his i'm her baby or whatever  and uh it's not like he not like she  just accepts er expects a lot out of my sister and i  she expects a lot out of herself also  mkay okay   she's taking a university course eh  mkay okay   and she's been tak she's taken   three of them so far like in nursing and she doesn't need to but she   word   cos she wants to  yeah and she's been doing really well in them because she wants to try and get her degree wi   aright all right   she's been nursing for like over over um     i dunno don't know how long like over thirty years probably   mm hmm mm hmm   and um so she doesn't need it you know but she just wants to do it you know  hmm that's good  hold on a second i just have to put lip stuff on  my lips are so chapped  laugh   my room is really dry so  well get a humidifier  uhh i'm going to  steal your parents laugh   yeah they don't have a very good one though i wanna  want to buy one laugh out of my school account  laugh   they'll let me do it they bought me a heater so  they bought you a computer  a heater  oh okay  i had a computer already so  pssht aren't you spoiled laugh   that's the second time you've said that in this conversation  oh i'm sorry laugh   if you're gonna going to count them geez  laugh   laugh   i just happened to notice um a little bit more than  usual   ahh oh  kay okay but don't hold it against me  no  laugh so when are you going to go down there  what  when are you gonna going to go down there to windsor  i don't know  you don't know which two weeks he's gonna  going to be back or  uh he's coming back on the twenty-eighth   just give me a sec second and i'll look at my nifty calendar here hold on  mkay okay   have my unicorn calendar  your unicorn calendar  yeah i love unicorns  laugh   kay okay he's coming down on the twenty-eighth  mm hmm  and then i should probably look at my school calendar but anyways   and then he has to go back he has to leave like on the twelfth  okay w   so i'd probably go down like the weekend of the third and fourth  mm hmm mm hmm   like second third and fourth  mkay okay   what would you be doing the weekend before he came   the the seventeenth and the eighteenth i think it is or something like that  the nineteenth and twentieth  nineteenth and twentieth that's it  i dunno don't know i'm  gonna going to look at my school calendar so i can see what kind of homework i have kay okay   mkay okay no prob  problem pause for about 12 seconds   just cos this is a better indication because it tells me when all my homework is due  laugh i got three exams and two term papers due the monday uh oh  uhm nineteenth and twentieth have communications letter uhh community and civic life issue paper and social psych paper  on due on the twenty-first twenty-second and twenty-third  snort busy weekend  actually it's not that bad  mkay okay because uhh my roommate's girlfriend is going down to belleville for a wedding and so i was thinking of catching a lift with her or whatever  when is she going down  she's going down the friday night and she's coming back the sunday   what do you mean she's go   oh like you would come down here that would be awesome  yes laugh   so uhm if school isn't a problem then i could probly  probably you know  i dunno don't know if she's  gonna going to catch a ride down or take a train or whatever but you know i was thinking of going with her  yeah that would be cool  mm hmm  now certain conditions do apply  one is as long as i can get the time off cadets and two as long as i can get the money for it  yes oh yeah i understand totally  you know   but if there's no problem with you with me coming down for the weekend then hey  i might just be able to get down there to see you  the only thing i have to do is i have to clear it with my landlady  mm hmm  because she's a real bitch  mkay okay   not really but she doesn't like me having people over really  i could imagine laugh   and um so you know she knows that you're not my boyfriend so i don't think it would be that big a deal  like i have a pull out bed here  mm hmm  and like a couch that's like a bed you know  mkay okay   and i have um a chair that's a bed also like it's like you pull it out and  anyways so like i have the room and everything  mm hmm  but it's just whether she'll let me   well clear it with her and uh you know whether it's yes or no give me a call and tell me  hey   what   oh no but you wouldn't have a car that wouldn't be very good  what sleep in the car  no no no

two thousand words due on friday that i haven't started yet  mm hmm  and on monday i have uhm a book report due  mkay okay   on a textbook that we're doing for human relations a course that i totally despise  snicker well you gotta  got to take the good with the bad come on   dramatic sigh   you know what is really dumb  what  we have to register uhm on january second for our second semester  like why they don't register the whole year at one time i don't understand but january second at ten a m  well the thing is if you fail something the first semester you can't really take you know laugh the following  course the second semester  okay okay but   okay but get this  we have to register on the si er on the second   mm hmm  and we don't start classes till the sixth   sigh   and not only that here's another catch  okay  people who live in residence the residence doesn't open till the second  mm hmm 
Canada	 so they have to they have to drive down that morning or they have to rent a hotel room for the night before with all their stuff that they're bringing back from christmas   oh   i   now does everybody   not everybody registers at ten o'clock  uh well our class does  mkay okay   like our course rec does  mm hmm   that sounds very confusing  it's stupid  like martha lives in residence  mm hmm  and uh we have a three hour drive  mkay okay   so i mean we could leave in the morning it's not like that big a deal but we'd have to leave pretty early to get here for ten  yeah but you'd be three words from anywhere like that would be hard pressed to get there for ten breath   mm hmm  geez  that's right  so   breath well that sounds just like us here so i   dunno don't know   register by phone and you know you've only got certain times of the day that you can call to register  starting at you know certain times of the month   it's weird   yeah i wish we could register by phone  i was lucky to get registered this year laugh   yeah  well i know it's always been difficult  my sister always had a hard time registering too  she always had to like she had to go um  like on registration day she had to go register for all her different courses   mkay okay   and um a lot of times she couldn't get the courses she wanted cos they'd already be booked up  even though she'd go and like she'd go first thing in the morning   yeah   cos you had to if you wanted to get that course   same thing happened to me laugh   see for us like since we're in the rec program   mm hmm  like all our courses are mandatory  mkay okay   so we have a set schedule and everybody who's in rec  does the same courses and   hmm interesting   so you've always got someone to study with  yeah  laugh   mm yep i do   sigh   sigh deduh deduh deduh  what breath i dunno don't know   thinking  sigh yes it's been a  two words   sigh stop thinkin thinking  about that laugh   and i have to fr i have to  renew my n l s national lifeguard service too   and i wanna want to do it like  before christmas   i don't know if i can two words to do it though  what do you have to go home to do that or  yeah   and how long would it take  well it depends who i get  if i get pam the bitch who i used to work for   mm hmm  she'll probably make me do the whole weekend  if i went to ottawa i could be done in two hours  mkay okay   so i might do that  i might go home for the weekend   drive down to ottawa   it's only a two hour drive to otta    yeah   well an hour and a half to ottawa so   mm hmm   it's not that big a deal to drive into ottawa do the thing and then come back because   one of the guys that uhm is in my rec course he's also a lifeguard  mm hmm  and uhh he said in ottawa you don't have to do situations  mkay okay   and like that means like they have you stand in the pool and all the rest  there's a whole bunch of people in the pool and they pretend to have someone drown  alright  and you have to save them  that's what a situation is  yeah  and those are the worst things right because they're so non-real like   okay   i can't explain it to you but it's just so fake that   it's ridiculous  laugh   and not only that but like you're y  you you're tense right from like as soon as you stand on the deck because you know something's gonna going to   happen  mkay okay   and it's probably gonna going to be something major cause it's an n l s  it's probably gonna going to be a spinal or a head injury or you know  something that you probably wouldn't see  no you'd see it but it's just something that you   it's really big to deal with and   mm hmm   so you're like  and sometimes it's not even sometimes it's just like a weak swimmer or something and that you have to throw them  a fut flutto a flutter board but you know like it's just it just it puts like so much stress on you  mkay okay   it's not the same as normal guarding cos i save people and i don't it's not the same kind of stress as when you know it's gonna going to happen  well as soon as it happens it's you know you don't think  you're in there and up you go   you're programmed yeah exactly   exactly you're programmed but when you know what's gonna  going to happen and you're waiting for it to happen then like there's a million things running through your mind  so it's not a real life   situation  no   but so i might do that  i told jim to find out when the next one is and  we'd do it together  hey sounds good  yeah  that way you could work next summer at cadet camp yay  yeah maybe i'll do   the camp  well cos i need a job obviously  mm hmm   and uhm  you have to pay for those nights out at sassy's right   laugh   uh huh   i dunno don't know but for some reason whenever i was at sassy's hardly any money came out of my pocket so   laugh ah except for that one night where it's like i walk in damon let me buy you a drink i'm like okay laugh   yeah there was that one night  sniff oh i still remember that geez  stumbling back into the t   yeah walking up the hill with you on my shoulders after i'd ripped my pants  that was good laugh   you know what that stupid fly just landed on my floor  kill it  start whisper i'll try but i don't know if i can get him quite from here end whisper   hey you living on the second floor of a house  yeah  mkay okay   and you just have a room to yourself that's all  oh i got him yes  woohoo   congratulations   what  congratulations  thanks  laugh starts hold on a second okay laugh ends   pause for about 10 seconds   woohoo   now he won't be annoying me  laugh   he was driving me insane  i have a fluorescent light on my ceiling and he just kept bumping into it  and you know that buzzing noise they make it started  to get really aggravating   yeah   so he's gone yay  laugh   and i didn't even like squash him i just stunned him  mm hmm  woohoo  cos i didn't wanna want to squash him on my rug  and so where is he now  he's i squished him up into my garbage can  he's probably still alive and could come out  no  d'ya do you think  maybe  if he isn't dead if you just stunned him yeah  kay okay i'll watch  laugh   laugh   i can see you're gonna going to be very busy for the rest of the evening  laugh well i won't watch that long  i'll watch for like a minute  i don't think he is cos he's wrapped up in a kleenex  ah he'll work his way through  if he's if he's stunned he'll work his way through  flies are hardy creatures i'm telling you   so this room that you're in do you have your own way in there or is i what   no  come in through the front door up the stairs  yeah  gotta got to be quiet when you come in at three in the morning  yeah cos um her room is right beside my room  mkay okay   so   but it's pretty nice cos i have a couch and a chair and a little coffee table and a t v and my computer desk and my dresser and my bed and  mkay okay   my two dressers and my bed  sounds like a very big room  what  sounds like a very big room  it is a big room it's very big  cozy  laugh cozy  there's so much furniture in there it has to be cozy laugh  and my fridge  i forgot my fridge  ah geez laugh   yeah  sounds good  you prefer that to residence or  yeah definitely  why  residence is loud  mm hmm  it's five minutes away from school and buses don't run on sundays and it tase it takes ten bucks  to get into town from residence  and buses stop running at eleven  mkay okay   but it's five minutes  is that what you said  it's five minutes from the school  okay  it's about twenty minutes from town  ah i understand  and so where you are now how far how long   does it take you to get to school  i catch the bus at about twenty-five after and i get there at quarter-to  that's not too bad  yeah  hmm okay  so i don't mind that  you're sort of like well no you're not like me  laugh   no i'm not   ten minutes i'm downtown ten minutes i'm at school  okay  yeah well cos i can walk downtown in in   ten minutes easy  mm hmm  and that's where i catch the bus  but i usually catch a bus from here to downtown anyway cos   you're lazy  well it doesn't cost me any more  true  and   laugh you get to sleep in an extra five minutes laugh   no actually i probly probably  could get down there faster if i walked because what i do is i get all ready to go and i look at the clock and i think oh geez i better go catch the bus  cos i'm always afraid i'm gonna going to   miss it  laugh   so i go out there and then i wait for like ten minutes and then i'm like fuck why am i out here so early  laugh   but   alright  so i probably would get there faster er  it probably wouldn't take me as much time   mm hmm  if i walked  oh well   but i walk home every night so i figure that's my good deed   and i i have phys ed  physical education three times a week monday wednesday and friday  okay   so   and we do sit-ups and push-ups and running and  word and stuff   that keeps you busy   yeah so it keeps me pretty active so  and also tomorrow night i'm going to go to the arena and see about starting skating again down here  mkay okay   cos my mom said she'd pay for it so   not that i'm doing it just to get some money out of her or anything like that   laugh   i'd like to try and finish my word   anything your parents pay for take it  laugh word from the wise laugh   but uh it's just cos i uhm wanna want to  try and finish my last test  mm hmm  i think that would be a good idea and uh well i think i can do it so  well how much time do you have to for   your last test  well i can take as long as i want  mkay okay   and then after that what can you do  whatever i want  can teach or  i i taught last year  okay  in deep river  but uhm it goes something like this  finishing all your tests is kind of like having like a university doctorate  okay  and uh you know finishing like a couple of them is like going to like grade school high school kinda kind of   thing and  ah  it's just  so obviously you're gonna going to get paid more the more tests you have the more experience you have  i understand   it works like that so   i did a year of coaching already and uh i was getting paid twenty dollars an hour then  impressive  yeah for starting right so  who knows maybe i won't work at the cadet camp next summer maybe i'll be coachin coaching somewhere  maybe  that might be good for you  yeah  actually you know that job was like the best thing to do for the course i'm going into  okay  cos it totally  i still don't ah shit  what  whenever i talk to you i always remember about my canoeing course and that i haven't received anything saying that i passed it and i need it  like i'd really like to have something to say i passed my first like my canoe instructor  mm hmm  ah i'm gonna going to have to get a hold of someone down there   anyways uhm because totally like everyone in my class either like worked with handicapped kids worked as a lifeguard worked as something but i worked as like a recreation person you know  yeah  like i was totally like everything 
Canada	 motivation then stop it   there you go   okay  ya  right  and they may even go on eh  in short i mean word laugh  oh   in short   ya laugh   now a few words got on to  word laugh   word   alright   you could do em them twice if you want  but not   more than that   ya   you can tell that i'm trying to stop myself  laugh   in fact a few words laugh  what i really want is a say laugh instead  okay  well i hope you're comfortable with this  oh ya ya it's fine  okay  soon ya   oh there's no problem  okay  you know what that is an important thing you know   like the uh word not being related to self-esteem  ya  it's funny  ya   i didn't consider it  word ya but to me it's so obvious that it wouldn't be two or three words self-esteem   a few words discussion  and that is the trouble with it during our discussion  a few words asks us where high self-esteem needs a little bit more word defensive  like cos word know you know what i mean  they point to their own failure   uh the the significance  uh like a failure is is sig  significant maybe significant   the importance   tend to oh  depreciate the significance reading   ya  and discount the importance of goal word  reading   ya i  it's maybe my own quite a few words mumbled   discussion about recording   right  i mean it's i picked it up  about three words   i'm gonna going to go through  quick  ya i word just to get a general  feel  ya sure  okay   mhh   i'm about a third of the way down page eleven  right   so i can just say high word   do you prefer high self-esteem individuals or  individuals high in self-esteem   either way   it doesn't matter to me  cos one sounds a little bit more word   it doesn't matter  from a clinical and word perspective    i don't know why you need to bring up that absolute   word deemed almost unattainable   it's like to be honest it doesn't flow  okay  ya i just put it in so i wouldn't get caught with anyone thinking  two words that you could know yourself  well maybe you can just word it that   you seem to be coming back in  i think you made your point for the development of increased knowledge  you made your point word that it's increased   it's increased that's good enough   right   then have a sentence that says you know  at the end get rid of that one and at the end say you know  this contrasts with the assumption that uhm   right   ya that may kind a few words it   it's gonna going to be a bit harder than word   uhm ya brief exchange between professor and extra-corpus speaker   just resource   ya   it deflects uhm a healthy psychological function involving word   cut cut the  effort energy i mean probably you want to stick with resources   resources word  right  ya   ya   nice nice   you see this is much more substantial   mhh   it's much more uh substantial  orients the reader   the person has a sense as to you know the context of this where it fits into what people have thought about and so on and so forth  right a more larger picture   a much more larger picture   uh that's about it  you could footnote you know somewhere in your  in your thesis uh that that  you know the experimenter who who ran the study found that the high clarity people  were obnoxious laugh   uh huh   laugh ya ya i think i'll do that  laugh   but it could be noted laugh   she word find them irritating obnoxious  laugh ya  huh   i mean that would be an interesting study eh  i mean just to do that  ya   cos they were irritating  ya  ya just to get them  brief exchange between professor and extra-corpus speaker   maybe  uhm not sure  so i think from the beginning you'll have to say something like uhm an individual's time and a few words  to make uh uh   okay  good  who who   does that make sense   i think so   okay   cos i was trying to explain   like i was had this thought and i was trying to explain it and i tried many different ways laugh cos it wasn't coming through as intelligible you know  huh  a few words mumbled hold because some  word are the focus it's likely that they will in part determine reading   that's what i that's what i'm trying to get    that was the major   ya   that's what's going on in self-reflection so  what you come in with should influence what's going to come out  ya  ya  okay  the extent to which reading   all right   it's nice eh  ya it does feel better   ya it's like like  nice  mhh it has a flow  it has that more of a thread  and i think for the reader it's like mhh  you know it's natural development context you know   sophis sophisticated balance   good so it pulls you in sort of   you're talking about literature  you're talking about research  you're talking about you know heaven forbid psychoanalytic thinking and stuff   laugh ya really   but only in a very historical way  that's right true true   yes exactly   it's part of the background so  well i heard from someone if you don't cite freud in your p h d thesis laugh you're in big trouble in psychology  laugh   where   it just is  i don't know where i heard that but it's just this funny little sort of  gotta got to just fit freud in even if it doesn't fit your research thought  even if you're doing like you know left uh  hemispheric uh simulation of a rat  you know laugh you have to put freud in   laugh somehow ya  ya   so so you need a sentence that says   ya i'm going to look at my own thesis to see if i cited   him or not   ya you should laugh   okay   oh on page seven this individual difference thing  ya   that's where i'm trying to i was trying to take into consideration your comment about sort of  you need more of a background and so forth  ah yes   okay   maybe i went off too far  for example as an word  operational two words demonstrate themselves in terms of self-descriptive trade adjectives word to indicate the degree to which they're aligned reading   mhh hmm   nice  it works better eh like compared to that abrupt paragraph laugh i had before which is just like   two words measure period you know  nice   mhh   it might be worth noting somewhere i don't know where that the the theme that you and i have bounced around off and on for years is this issue of you know what does it mean to be  undifferentiated  for example that tra you know that without necessarily measuring clarity a lot of measures  do measure it in in in  indirectly in the sense that uh people they may me measuring in that people you know who don't have  who don't strongly endorse any  items on tra meas  measures on on you know self-report uh trade measures or whatever may in fact be uh uhm  low in clarity  mhh hmm   right right right   right   uh low in clarity   like the undifferentiated  and maybe that's where i could just  or the aschema people  exactly exactly   you know but just say it briefly  exactly   just not go into the whole detail like i did last time  that's right  so you could add that in maybe towards the end   of of general discussion of of the of the range of uh  measures you know  of the uh   approaches right   okay   uhh   that would be nice  yup  and it's kind of implicit   right  it's implicit in a whole bunch of different measures   and but here we have a real measure of the actual thing now  that's it   ya   why is it uh construct validity thing that it correlates with neuroticism  because construct validity is does the measure also tap into things that it sh does it relate to things that should be related to conceptually   right  so neuroticism  i said neuroticism or lability of mood because neuroticism is  lability of mood in that kind fluctuatingness  ya it is but it's stretch   i mean neuroticism is a lot of different things and uhm  including ah you know  mhh hmm   so how about just li lability  of mood then questioning   ya and even there it's not clear to me that  that at a level of construct validity  oh that they'd necessarily be labile   ya someone can say i'm moody   right and i'm damn sure of it  ya   i'm real i'm  word and i know it  word   so at you know at  an abstract level  okay   well maybe just the reduced awareness then and scratch the other  ya   ya   cos i mean that's what she found but i mean  you see mhh  cos she provi   the problem is that she provides a rationale for why they might be  but i'm not here you know  as i recall like in her paper she says it's for the construct validity because she presents some kind of rationale  right   then you'd need like a little stem in there that would say you know in support of the measures construct validity blah blah bl  individuals low in self-clarity report reduced awareness of thoughts and feelings and uhm   they and then in a separate sentence they also report uh greater neuroticism which is thought to be a part of self low clarity because dah dah dah   dot dot dot  exactly   okay  and that's what you'd need  right  it so if i include it it needs the rationale  ya  otherwise take it out  ya  okay   i'll see what her rationale is and see how i can  if it adds i'll definitely put it in  if it doesn't then you know  ya   a couple lines down uh that is not tied to any one particular trait that's a little colloquial  ya how do you  not tied down   that is not uh uh specific to any  one particular   right   as i try to get away from talking too abstractly and too jargony then i sometimes go to the other extreme which is to be too  you know it's hard to get that middle road  ya ya  uh this is uh  i'm so pleased  it's it's it this is fun  oh i'm glad   well i really enjoyed it  like i've been having a blast doing it  you like it   ya ya ya ya   that's great that's great   mhh   you're kind of finessing well now the  accuracy of simulation thing  mh   ya i'm trying to get away from that accuracy  word  uh   ya  i think if you could not use it at all it would be best  m'kay okay   you you mean that  which page are we on  you're on the nine now   page nine ya  right  the one place i use it   right   still still  it it just it's  it's dangerous   it stands out   okay  it's touching on all   that word priority may not correspond to to accurate appraisals you know it's just that there may be motivational   you're still pitting accuracy against motivation  uh huh   so just take the accurate out   is that what you mean  get rid of the word accuarte or even cut all  motivation   i would just cut accuracy totally  and just say look you know as you said it's a hypothesis or a belief  okay   it may or may not actually correspond  and the two may be different  mhh hmm   you know you might have uhm uhm   mhh interesting  quote mumbled   right   uh exactly  so in essence judgments of self-concept clarity reflect an abstract belief or hypothesis about the stuff that may not readily be supported by one's own experiences   that's good enough  ya  i think so  ya   and uhm  it suggests that there may be a motivational component to judgments of self-clarity or   see even there again it's like   word bring in that motivation thing    ya it's as if you're you   to bring in motivation you you it's as if you need to   right and you don't have to  you don't have to  you don't have to have no accuracy to be  motivated  that's right   okay word   it's not pi   it's not like the old affect versus cognition   right   okay  it's the two are all interconnected  right  so basically you've raised the question that well you know uhh actual experience are not linked to global judgments  right  global judgments are just that  they're kind o of   they're more abstract more  word   they're more abstract   they may or or not be tied to the person's uh exper  experience uh actual experience   experience   right   so you kind of work that through  now what i'm trying to get to  ah you just hit it  other things therefore can intervene sort of in what makes you come to your judgment which is the point of this paragraph   exactly   there may be ah a number of factors uh uh other than a review of one's experience that contribute  to you know self-clarity   ya two or three words ya   mhh hmm   so it's just one of many things  right  because you see even the selective review business comes in  like you could do like uhm kunda's motivated reasoning paper  mhh hmm   you see that that would maybe be a bridge where you could say well for one thing the reviews might  be selective   you know ah the person may particularly ah focus on or there might be a hypothesis confirmation of  of process  right   right 
Canada	 the classic you know social type of thing  mhh hmm   and in this case it's your own hypothesis by yourself so you look for confirming information so   right  and you'll find it and then you go on and it maintains it  hmm  so there's so there's all kinds of  social co you know cognitive things that may be going on  and there could be motivational things  right  so it's not   either or  ya you're still at the accuracy versus motivation   ya at a very like  cos i'm afraid that if it is accurate then it can't be motivated  i i i see now that i got into this equation no accuracy equals motivation equals rationale you know which  isn't doesn't have to be that way  no  okay  no  it's uh it's simply in a sense  you're you're taking the uh the  you know the old-fashioned view   more old-fashioned views or   the old-fashioned view  and it's  here the way you have it set up starting with you know the klein and the loftis point is nice because you're saying well you know the   rational model so to speak doesn't hold  probably and there may be many things operating bum bum bum  bum   mhh   mhh hmm >  right   right it's more complex and   word suggest   that's it   dekunda 's in in psych  bull   psych bull i think psych review  but i think ps ps psych  i think it's psych bull   i think that'll help  so that cos you can tell i'm looking for that bridge right about there laugh you know and uh i don't want to create it artificially when there is a nice way to create it so  ya and you don't word   ya i think you can flow  just cover a range of issues including  motivational factors  right   mhh hmm  uhm   see i don't know if on page nine when you say this motivational component may involve a defensive reluctance to acknowledge self- confusion is that what it is or is it that  mhh   or to avoid   ya  is is it is it  you wanna want to   you you're   reluctant to acknowledge something or you just want  to   mhh hmm   right   to avoid it   mhh  or not confr confront   or just not   it's ki kind   well let's do let's put it his way  oh you want to maintain your stablity as opposed to  avoiding instability  it's different   avoid instability   it's a different assumption  vis-&agrave;-vis as opposed to   right  it's a maintenance model not a warding off model  right right right  right   and you know why this ends up sounding like this  defensive reluctance to acknowledge   why   because when we included experiment one  with the defensiveness measure  the only way you could work the defensiveness is to the reluctance to acknowledge your own  ya   ahh   oh i see  yes   okay  so laugh i see exactly where that's coming from  right   okay   so it's ah more of the maintenance to maintain their stable  word self   exactly   so it's kind of a different uhm feedback model so to speak   mhh hmm   and that's actually more in line of uhm with uh  what's his name sorrentino's arguments  his is totally pitted that way  it's the high-certainty person is the maintaining one and the low-certainty attaining one  they attain   ya   mhh nice nice   ya you see there you could do even there you could do a c f sorrentino  for example  right   that's that's fine   like when i say the the   motivational account like in terms of  maintaining at a low word people to attain i mean that is sort of his  that's right   so i could just c f him without being   that's that's a very reasonable thing to c f him there cos it's it it  says compare  yet laugh </o > compared to   sorentino and that's the parallel argument   it sounds horrible laugh   ya laugh ya   right and his discussion   exactly   oh so that's good  that's perfect  hmm   right   okay   well it seems redundant there  you've got defensive reluctance to acknowledge   mhh hmm   next sentence may not readily acknowledge   right  next sentence they may be quite motivated to avoid   laugh i say the same thing three times   i i i don't know   laugh i know what you mean  so one of those is going like that's all going a bit too far  i word   ya anyways so i i'm going for like uh two days  uh i'm going to hit washington for half a day as well i guess   to wall street  to wall street ya  so i'm seeing their salomon brothers' chief  income strategist uhh the head of fixed income trading at morgan stanley  mh hmm   uh huh  uhm he earns like sixty billion dollars in bonds or something like that  it's going to be quite a quite a  trip so   i'm going to do some econometric testing of their uh yield curve model  see if it really works i guess  uh huh   i guess morgan stanley has developed this stuff on var this value at risk a few words   ya okay   have you seen their their work there a few words   ya i get their risk metrics and stuff like that  so you get this thing regularly eh   ya ya   it comes out how often   it seems it seems  like it's just a garch generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity kinda kind of   or a lot of it  or they're big on garch  they try and sort of do garch for dummies  changing volatilities  ya   this is this is the next big thing  like every publication now has got stuff on v a  on value at risk   so it's   ya   because it's sort of the uh  the thesis topic to come  but now we've gotta got to worry about yours  exactly   so the story is uh   ya   where where are you at  you say you've done a little bit of uh estimation  you've done some of the de rosa   essentially   ya   exactly   ya i did i've done the de rosa  what i did though is i uhm uhm i'm  kind of keen on rolling regressions and and so   instead that way i only get a big in-sample or out-of-sample period estimated and it allows for the coefficients to  change   mh hmm   mh hmm   uhm and and so i've done it both ways anyways  but i did the rolling regression estimates of de rosa's  uhm and i compared them with the salomon brothers' uh values  now this is the the sort of the  what i need to know is stuff like uh how fancy a model are we going to use for hedging  just a simple hedge ratio  like if we say the durat  duration we know the duration of the futures contract   uhm are we just going to do a linear weighting so that we uh come up with our targeted duration or to neutralize duration  mh hmm  uhm stuff like that   and then ma what i'd like to know is sort of maybe we could agree on a frameworks for what's  all of the steps i could do and then it would constitute the  finished work  ya   well i think that the the the f   the way you got it organized is just to uh focus  and   and that's an important thing and if you're going to  get out of here is to look at it in the form of the number of steps right  right  exactly   you say that you've got the uhm introduction  sort of the you've got the  you've got the topic right  right  the basic topic is is uhm  developing a new better model for measuring duration right  so just like everything else right  sitting down and writing is is is   the the the the tough part but it's the part that you got to organize  mh hmm  so you introduce your topic one introduction right  just as uhm  mh hmm   did you write uh a proposal for  of any sort for   i i've actually i've written some stuff   did you write me a proposal when you did your   thing   uhm no i   i can't remember what i did off hand but i have written a few pages about you know just uh it's not really uh structured that well but it is a bit of a review and sort of a bit of what ifs and ands  ya   and i meant to bring it actually and i i  ran out the door this morning kinda kind of   fast   i see   i can probably fax it to you or email it to you   ya but you you could but i mean the the important thing is that  right we get get down to it right away  right  the the uh you can think of it as well i'm i'm writing my proposal which is  gonna going to be the the final product as well  word cos we're   we're skipping that stage cos right we're not uhm  right ya   cos i don't i   i mean there is a research grant competition for collecting data and for everything else and word you've got  that s that stuff   ya but i got all the data i need   so you just wanna want to get ah ah something that's that's quick  and uh proper and state of the art and publishable right  exactly   right  so you lay out your problem in the introduction   you got your literature review  mh hmm   right  and the literature review you try to make it a synthesis right  there isn't a lot out there and there's uh the de rosa that you can refer to and then there's the complicated ways of  doing working at it  exactly ya   ah there there aren't a lot of empirical duration models out there  right   there's that word paper  that that i'm working on that you  you've got there uhm with   with jay and   harry   mh hmm   word that  uhm i don't know if you've had a had a   chance to go go through that  ya  ya actually i'd word   there's also ah ah a d l j investment bank, donaldson, lufkin & jenrette uhm empirical duration that they use  empirical model   it it's pretty simple though actually  they uhm their hedge ratio is based simply on price changes relative to price changes in the ten-year treasury and then it's a percentage of the duration of the ten-year treasury  mh hmm  ya  it's simpler than the de rosa  uhm but it it's very easy to calculate  it might be worth throwing in you know as an extra  duration comparison again so we might have a word   do you get the journal of fixed income where you work  uhm we do but we don't  uh for some reason some of the issues have disappeared and that one you told me about actually has disappeared  i had to get a   the one with the the   paper by dublusky or or   d breeden's paper  uhh   was it d breeden or word   ya september or december ninety-five  december ninety-four   sorry  ya   i think   ya  that's ya the the one that you  you had emailed me  that   so you haven't gone through it yet  i haven't gone through that one no  hold on   kay okay/+> i've got it here   let's let's dig it out  so one of the things and  uhm what's clear from that paper is that right if you try to measure duration if i can find it it's not very stable   mh hmm   it's not stable and uh if you do it  look at it from ah a one factor model  right   and he he uses a very simple approach just saying well let's regress the percentage of the prices on the ginny mae's government national mortgage association  or on the fanny mae's federal national mortgage association   i mean the question is we gotta have got to   focus on when you said you did the estimation are looking at  ginny mae's or fanny mae's or what are you word   looking at   they're all fanny mae's  okay   i've got > coupons from six and a half to ten percent basically  the generic i suppose   uh huh   so he looks at it from a number of different perspectives  uhh across the empirical durations  exhibit twenty-five where's that  they're they're all very  unstable and uh what what one   of the things that he finds here is well throw in a ah if you throw in a two factor model right you get a better fit  mh hmm   mh hmm  and uhm actually there are a couple of papers   that that that i think you should look at uhm  besides that   and uh cough right he quotes a paper by waldman uhm  in the journal of fixed income 
Canada	 december ninety-two and   i might have that one  what's the title on it   ya so these ones i don't have  beyond duration a couple words    so maybe if you could sort of get   get   that one here   kay okay/+>   ya  i'm i'm quite sure i do have that one then   so i'll i'll make a star there  and also this uh volatility and yield curve   it's a short piece by liverman   uh i went through this paper but i i  don't think that i made a made a   copy of it and i guess it'd be worth worth  having as well which word   two or three words   word which is   this is the latest one   it's also from the same journal  they're all from the same  journal   okay ya   ya i have two or three from the journal of fixed income so i think i have this one as well   so i wa i i can give you copies of both of those  ya asap as soon as possible  certainly  uhm like today if you can or if you can fax   em them if you've got em them    uhm   i think i can do that  sure   and what other things uh can can  we say   uhm uh the bottom line is measuring the the  performance  and how you can measure the performance you could say well you could look at the mean square error or the mean absolute error of the forecasts and uh   mh hmm   you might wanna want to do a market timing test   right  if you're f if you're forecasting  this is what the duration is of this sample uhm say well well that's the proportion that your uhh duration model says you should take a position say that's long or that's short and i can give you the program that i wrote for the henrickson-merton procedure  mh hmm   and i wrote a program in word  that does it  kay okay/+>   and that's that's in our new paper that's coming out in the journal of futures markets   i just got the gallies uh yesterday and they said  i i took a look at the letter it says  laugh please respond within forty-eight hours   it's one of these things that okay here you've got all this other nonsense that's going  on and then there's a deadline of forty-eight hours you know  laugh   uh huh   that's why you gotta have got to  pose deadlines cos that's how you get things done  so i dropped everything and was here at midnight last night getting in the the proofs  right   but cough uh you've got a copy of this paper have you the one we did on mean reversion cos i think you have an earlier version  okay ya i do i do   the the latest version   the version's that's going into the journal does some hendrickson-merton tests for market timing  mh hmm   so we're saying we're we're  gonna going to forecast what it's going to be   well let's and it's gonna going to give us a decision rule right  mh hmm   we go long or we go short   how what do you use for your forecasting  is it like ah ah an word or   no the the forecasts here are based on filter roles that say that well if we got  uhh if we're outside the range then go long  if we're or go short   cough   okay  is it is that is that uhm a well-established decision rules or can we mess around in the decision rules  well what decision rule have you got in mind   cos i cos i actually i did   some research on sort of ah technical rules uhm and i used the moving average crossovers and trading rules like that uhm  cough versus naive uhm positions in uh a ten year  bond and i actually came up with ah a hodrick-prescott filter uhm which uh is a or which outperformed   the the moving average technical trading rules uhm  uh huh   uh huh   now does that fit into the duration estimation or  no   uhm no it's only it's only a a   well then forget it   okay  ya so let's just focus on what we can do with the duration   uhm as opposed to a technical role cos we wanna   want to keep it narrow enough  okay   go in too many directions cos when you start  going in too many directions you end up going no place  right  okay okay   okay  so let's keep it pure and simple  let's just   okay  so i i can get a copy of this as well   you want a copy of this latest  word   laugh i i do  have the old one uhh somewhere   the old one the one that's coming out with the corrections i can give you a copy of as soon as we finish here  okay   and the breeden one you don't have so i'll give you the breeden one  in exchange what you'll do is you'll go out and get me the  the missing pieces that i put stars on here  right  uh so what else is cooking  you're you're taking a break from g d a to finish  they're going to give you the permission or   uhm ya  my we haven't basically my boss said  uhm he'll give me two weeks off to go all out and try to finish the thesis  uh so i said well it might be better off   is this your vacation time  uh no it seems to me it's going to be sort of work time  okay   so uh i mean cos he's the   stuff that i'm going to be finishing is actually going to be of use when we run a new product  uh huh  we'll probably publish uh empirical durations or something like that  uh huh   uhm cos uh c l k uses that  uh huh   they they publish empirical durations and they're sort of the street masters on empirical durations  uh huh   people listen to them  so we could probably do something better than  what they do obviously  uh huh   but the way i i what i w  what i told him or he told me i could have two weeks to do you know whatever  i said okay i'm going to talk to doctor fister and see if it's better two weeks off or maybe three days get you some stuff and get some feedback to you and then another three days later on uh things like that  well you know the deadline for graduation is when  see what it takes   uhm i've missed the application deadline  i'd still like to uh ya to me ya to me it's not important to which   graduation date it is uhm cos it taxwise  i i'm better off cough  but i would definitely like to have it fin  finished you know like before you know the  end of spring   ya if it's june or whatever   april fifteenth that's what you're going to try to finish by  that's what you were going to say   that would be perfect by me and even sooner if it's easier  but uhm  so you've got your lit review  here's what  you've got your methodology  cough   you're going to lay out methodolgy and data   the data and then results  five the results  is that   it involves something outperforms  your new empirical duration model works better  okay right   or new empirical duration model with all the complications on it works worse  you know whatever the the   data  shows   mh hmm okay   now how how   uhm   it better work better actually laugh   laugh cough as ya   cough well the preliminary one said it worked better so  it comes down to  well you can say it comes down to it  you know you report what's what's  correct right   ya okay  what what's would be sort of standard for adjusting hedge ratios and things like that  like i'm using weekly data  the salomon data i have is weekly   uhm is there any reason i shouldn't adjust the hedge ratios weekly  well that's the question  are you looking at hedge ratios or are you looking at duration that's the basis of the hedge ratio  or sorry  well like i i'm saying okay the duration say it's four years i take the mor  mortgage or the uh treasury duration i hedge  appropriately to either targeted duration or to neutralize my duration risk  uhm the next week say instead of the duration being four years it's three point eight do i readjust my treasury's hedge or do i just carry it to a specific horizon   ya  that's uh ki i mean a and then   then it  gets in to minimizing your transaction costs   uh   cos if you roll over every day it's expensive  that's right   right right   and what we we do in this paper is we say h here's the duration that's whatever it is   here's the ratio and we'll just run through it  fixed on this trading strategy  right   it may be different but it's uh uh not  gonna going to be worth your while i don't think to go every day  right   would it be   and it's just a question of  you know the the holding period in most of these studies is a week right  okay  so act actually   so that would work just fine because uh we get new duration estimates each week uhm from the salomon  uhm some of the other stuff is monthly unfortunately  i i'm going to see if i can get some uh  b weekly duration estimates from uhm uh morgan stanley when i go down there maybe even salomon   uh but i'm betting on weekly being about the best i can get  uhm cough and i've got most of the data already in  rats uh ready to run stuff  so that's a nice thing   mh hmm   i don't have to wait waste months working on data so  uhm but as as far as ahm sort of latitude of of empirical duration should i just stick with de rosa and maybe one other empirical duration measure and then compare it with my three or four wall street duration estimates   and then a few words   so you're going to get wall you've   got wall street duration estimates  right   you see that's the thing is that breeden's also got these new comparisons right with the some  empirical models  uh okay   the question is uhm   now the easiest thing to do and a parsimonious way of approaching the problem would be to   re refine the the de rosa and i thought that that was what the strategy  was going to be   mh hmm   right  oh definitely definitely  and that's why i'm saying a uhm   ya cos the wall street   ya if you get the wall street estimates right he's done it  already  and he shows that while they have some   some value these brokers' forecasts but at the same time right what goes into these things is right survival curves uhm the p s a   aging curves   mh hmm   mh hmm   right  so it's a lot of uh assumptions about lifetime prepayment rates that are  right   you know everybody's got their their   assumptions here and uh you need ah a heck of a lot of information  here to develop just this one part of uh  the broker's approach to getting the final number of  of the duration  mh hmm   so uhm and we don't want to do that because right   well i've already i've already  got their duration  i i was thinking of just you know using that as their black box   ya you could use that as a  benchmar benchmark as one of the benchmarks  with the with the de rosa and that would be i think very good  right   okay  uhm so do you do you think it's a good idea then to sort of go the way you've you've done  on yours whi which is   which is just uh doing a splining finding of the uhm price yield ratio which   ya well we just did it  that's that's what we did  and we can say what's what's the point of doing it  that's correct   is the the point to do is that it makes some sense although the  though in that this/=> book by  jayman that just came out  this guy used to be a teacher of mine at the university of pennsylvania many years ago uhm he a  really great econometrician but sort of he disappeared  mh hmm 
Canada	" uhh the business tax  right  so the city has told me that it's calculated uhm la valeur locative of the place  mm hmm  depending on the square footage and everything  kay okay   and seeing as our office is gonna going to  be very similar in square footage to uhh the dentist's   except that it's like about a third of the size  kay okay   i've used his business tax as a ballpark and  prorated it  and prorated it   okay  n'i and could be 'now' i  didn't know whether the business tax was actually uhm variable like let's say a dentist would be charged more because his like income is astronomical   well two or three words square footage is uh is a good allocation basis  so that's fine the way i do it  mm hmm   okay   yep   and that i understand is payable in february and june  we won't be starting until july so i just assume that we would pay it in july  maybe half the year's portion  two or three words cash flow  yes  i'll put that up in your cash flow as an word  in june  yeah  mm hmm  kay okay uhm alright that's done  now did the depreciation of assets do you need a specific table for that or i just put in our incomes to   snort ihh depends on the extent of the assets  whaddya what do you got a car or a computer   no it's just uhh the computer three thousand dollars and the printer three hundred at the two words    well two or three words  that's fine  then you're using c uh c a  uh the total percent  yep   actually uh contributed to a hundred percent in year one  that's the only uh word yeah   yeah maybe they mentioned that in class   so maybe i sh i had done  it as fifteen so it was carried over from year to year  fifteen percent  yeah  think it's too low  well sure because you gotta got to  take advantage as early as possible  if they allow you a hundred percent and you're  word you might as well just go right at it  okay   alright  and take it and go one because it's the only category that allows for a hundred percent uh in year one  okay  now the word analysis that i did is not an accounting for a word analysis  i didn't take into account pronounced "" accamp"" the depreciation  d'you do you want me to  breath no  the finan   the financial break-even   the financial break-even is more uhm uh  reflects uh  the cash  right mh hmm  okay  so that'd be more important  okay   now the flow of customers doesn't seem relevant to my project   they come in the door they get the appointment and they leave  uhm am i misunderstanding what you want from this   well the flow of customers is not necessarily why they're within the confines of the building  okay  flow of customers from the point of view of uhh how do they uh  three or four words   three words   do they do they two words  appointments three words uhh  you know what's the best sort of uh payment how do they  word do they get uhh  and once they're in what's the procedure for uh processing a client  do they go in the waiting room do they you know   are they offered coffee  okay  just kinda kind of like the flow  of the of the customer through your whole system  mkay okay   breath production plan system not relevant cos i'm not producing something right  no   cos you don't have any uh any two words    kay okay   now you mentioned that in the presentation not too much verbal detail that you only wanted a couple of overheads  uhm for your presentation yeah two words  ten minute hard earned presentation  so what am i doing with this presentation  can't sit there and   uhh you you you see sigh  overheads  there's a rule of thumb that says five minute max per overhead  you know because when you put up an overhead you can  leave it for five minutes  leave it there   okay  but that's a rule of thumb  some are less some are more breath   uhh do a few overheads because you don't wanna want to clutter 'em  them   you don't wanna want to have every  if you put up your uhm income statement  i'm not gonna going to put any financials up  okay good because   maybe a break-even chart  okay break-even chart's not bad  but anything where there's a lotta lot of   clutter you're gonna going to find a problem  no they're gonna going to sleep  exactly  so we wanna want to have a hard hitting visual or something that's really high impact  okay  low words very uh you know even graphics if necessary but uh just a few uh to highlight what you wanna  want to do  okay   and go ahead with the uh the  presentation is you wanna want to do uh if you   read an o read an overview of the opportunity  and then go right into your industry research  yeah that's what i was gonna going to   do then the target market  and then the marketing  exactly  and then operations   and operations   yes and finally finance and the highlights in financing   so it's almost like highlighting the point of the business plan  it has to be in highlights because especially when you come to financing there's no way you can do a coupleuh couple of  minute presentation on financing without more or less looking at an overview  what people are interested in knowing is how much is it  gonna going to cost you to start where are you  gonna going to get the money and what are your projections for earnings  kay okay   so essentially that's the key elements in   in financing from a superficial you know high   yeah   okay cos you mentioned that you really want us just to  sell it   i'm hopin hoping to drum up some business  right  but i'm not like looking at them as if they're potential shareholders  no   you really wanna want to get them to see the excitement the opportunity to see that you really believe in it that you've done your homework and that it could work it could fly  there's some feasibility to it and just like a resume creates the excitement for somebody to say why don't you come to an interview this would create the excitement for people to say i'd like to see your business plan because there's some details i'm not sure about but the idea seems uh  word seems good on  overview  good feedback yeah  mkay okay breath uhm  now my pessimistic   i noticed in your notes that you reduced it by fifty percent like you just said what would happen if you had half as much volume as you're anticipating  right  but seeing as our current operating level is just below  no just above break-even  mm hmm  what i did was i reduced it by thirty and i increased it by thirty for the probable either way   and i didn't wanna want to get too ridiculous and chop them in half because then we're done for the year type of thing  we've already done enough business in january february and march to almost break even  okay  we'd be totally unrealistic to say fifty percent less  exasperated sigh well how many clients is that based on  what are what are you using for the criteria  in other words like given a a  probable outcome how many people per week are you expecting  how many people per day   okay so what i have now   this i had to sort of make some decisions without you  we have a present client base of seventy-five people  kay okay   approximately forty percent of those are repeat customers so they come once a week  okay  so what i've done is for my income statements i drew it up on a six month  mm hmm  uhh like  based on the seventy-five   yeah   so that i could see the determine the  feas feasibility of moving it  outta out of the house on july first  so i really wanna want to facilitate the comparison of those two six month periods  okay  so i've put on my uh cash flow that january february march are actual figures  mm hmm  and the rest are projected  aright alright and projected on the basis of what the word that you have now  what we have now and maybe a little increase because we've already seen a twenty-five percent increase since january  wow  so that's legit  cos we just started in october  so in other   you see well when i'm talking about cutting by fifty percent your projections that's based on projections from zero  okay  so in other words you're anticipating w   in your case you have some actual numbers  right  so it'd be there is no point in cutting it in half because you you uh already got  present clients  okay  so to work with that as a starting base is very very realistic  that's fine   okay  that's your top end what di i m  what is the the t because again you're limited by  how you know facilities and so on and how many you can handle per day  yeah   i included that in my maths and income statements and then maybe year three we would take on another therapist  so   oh good   you'll have to be two or three words    we have one person doing the massage  three or four words you're limited by x amount of hours a day  you can only do so many   right  mm hmm  okay   that's your point is to see like you know what would be your saturation level when would you anticipate on hitting that level so that you can start projecting for that  word extra therapist other resources whatever  how constrained   right   okay   so that's alright that i did it six months at a time  yeah that's perfect  just so that okay it is an academic exercise but the reason why i took the course was to help me learn how to run a business and he started his business in october  mm hmm right  and it's not working out great at home so i thought okay this is my opportunity to do the actual research and comparisons and come up with   mind you   so word there's a proper environment to it which means that three words   cos i didn't wanna want to   fake it and pretend that the business doesn't exist yet  mm hmm  i wasn't sure if it was really considered a startup but i spoke to laura and she said it's only three months old it's a startup business anyway  it's a startup anyway because basically uhh i mean what you're looking at here is taking it off off in a new direction  right  it's not a continuation of a business as it was in the past you actually really restarted  expanding   okay  mm hmm  so we're fulfilling that requirement  mm hmm  good breath   mmm do i hafta have to take into account his education the costs or that's just a sump cost that was done like a year ago   education the uh courses to get the uh certification all that type of stuff  yeah   mm hmm   sigh that was done prior to the business  prior to october  and the business wasn't registered until uh october  didn't register it till february  february ahh  and that is carried back within a year and then it would depend on your fiscal year  if you're  a fiscal year now has to be a calendar year to move on  oh it is eh  yeah  oh cos see you used to be able to set your own fiscal  yeah they changed that this year  oh they did oh okay mumbling   cos within the cabinet within the the   say like for example if you didn't register a business uh till october and and you'd done some activity in june you could actually carry it back as part of the business so you you'd be in that  the registration itself wouldn't hafta have to  occur in sequence  okay  you you carry back  in this case to be honest with you and especially given  the the new restrictions on the fiscal year i don't real i can't really say  okay  i would see it as a sump cost but in actuality it's part of doing the business  i mean you wouldn't be able to do the business unless you  hadda had to put out for  well maybe i should put it in startup costs and uh have it asterisked pronounced asterixed as it's something that's already out of pocket  that's possible and also too you have to c   you have to also project for it to be ongoing because you know there are upgrades and courses and learning new techniques and so on and so forth  and courses yeah   kay okay   so that should be part of your budget each year cos that's two words for training and and so on   alright   training expense i guess you could call it "
Canada	 now i didn't know where  where did he go  what's he up to  now occasionally you see stuff in the journals  right  and he ended up in turkey and he's teaching at this  selfend university  now apparently they've been getting some good faculty out there  mh hmm   the guy that used to be the uh uhh head of the uh finance group at the university of ottawa a rihad tunis uh when he left ottawa he went to texas for the big bucks  huh   so then he was at the university of texas-austin  for se for many years but he's also gone gone to this this school in turkey  so apparently they must have a lot of money in turkey these days  i don't know where it's coming from cos they've  got so many people and they're  where it's coming from ya   they're supposed to be the grocer of the world but right  try to make a living selling groceries  i mean you got to produce oil i guess  groceries and kebabs laugh   anyways uh he's got a chapter in here that uh looks at  splining and it's sort of the first sort of critical paper or  critical chapter saying that well splining can  doesn't always give you the results that you want or   that that are the correct results  mhh   uhm so well you want to talk about the shortcomings of everything huh but you could refer to to  this as uhm some new work that's going the opposite direction  that with splining you're over-fitting and uhm you're not  gonna going to have uh you're not going to get the the the correct results   in uh  or if you make type a lot of type two  errors you're going to be uh accepting the null hypothesis when it's false  mh hmm  so i g i guess we should take a look at this but at the same time uh how wha   have have you done the splining too  the the approach that we took yet or  so so what is it  no i haven't done that much   uh i mean we could try doing what  try garching it or or   ya well i i mean and  there's there's there's there's a lot of different permutations we can do on de rosa  uh huh   and that's cough i guess that's sort of more the most  important uh part is that the or for me is that the   contribution the empirical duration uhm coming up with a way of refining the de rosa  uh huh   i mean there's you know the rolling regression is one way which makes a lot of sense to me  uh but that's really i guess just a testing issue  i mean the splining is may have some problems but at the same time nobody's looked at  the the potential problems of splining with this particular problem  mh hmm   right   and the uh the  other discussion the other possible approach is this the  two factor discussion the two factor price elasticities which he shows that well what you gotta have got to do is add up the coefficients  if you add up the coefficients you end up getting uhm   better better numbers or more reasonable numbers uhm than if you just go for a   mh hmm   so he he says well look at the sensitivities relative to a short-term euro as well as a long-term  bond  mh hmm   okay   and so there's two sensitivities there  and then you get a ah a better fit   ver versus your ordinary way of measuring  uhm   that makes a lot of sense too  ya i like that cos like you said you really notice a big difference when the yield curve is flattening and the ten year is rallying but short rates aren't and if you compare duration with  cos all of these durations are based on parallel moves and that is never the case   ya see this is non - parallel interest curve shifts and uh  so that's the story   so that's all in here   okay what   now how what would be a  a good path to build on that though  that's all here   like i i'm presuming that obviously i can't uhh   ya but you can say the these are the fits that you're getting  you're fo you you   go with the two factor model as  as opposed to a   a large factor model but you   you're going for a two factor right what the heck  is is the duration  really  mh hmm   and the word   mh hmm   i mean the the standard duration d p over p is alpha plus beta times the d i sort of thing the interest rate  right   and that's the interes interest   word   and then just one interest rate  so we're saying got two interest rates we can say well this is the duration it's the coefficient of d i is the duration  mh hmm   so we got two of these things  well what exactly is th the  duration right  is it a linear combination and what kind of a linear combination  right   i'm not too sure   a few words trying to interpret uhm   so you can say well you've got a really clean way to interpret it  ya   you could say well d i you can take as as  the average interest rate change  right  right  so the long and the short the so take the   average of that and that  mh hmm   but ya okay  but it's not that same  it's not the same   hmm  okay   so that's the strategy right  you you lay it out and you organize  you you organize it and you sit down and you do nothing else   for for two weeks in a row and   right uhm keep me informed sort of every couple of days where where it's at  word it   right okay   uhm okay  uh so maybe what i'm gonna going to do then is draw up a battle plan of the amount of time i can spend or  or when i can get the time the two weeks  it'll probably be   well i mean this is the story  right now better pronounced 'batter' plan or no battle plan i wanna want to see kind of a introduction and literature review one week from today  right  okay   uhm actually i can even probably spend the weekend doing this uhm cos i've got most of the papers uhm  and that'll put it together  so you get all the papers together   right   uhm add em them to here and sort of get that phase done  so that's that's the deadline one week from today  okay  i'll try and make it a little shorter uh or sooner even if i can  so probably the two weeks off would be or the two weeks i could do it uhm i'm hoping will be the since i'll be in new york  starting thursday it'll probably be be   the following monday   uh but that being said i think this i can still do   or or i might get   this you gotta have got to do  this you gotta have got to do regardless  i mean you say you're going to set up the total battle plan  exactly   okay  here's the problem let's identify the problem  right   mh hmm   okay  which means jeez it's gonna going to  be a hectic time  i you're gonna going to be on the road there at at g d a 's expense  is that the story that you're st   staying they're putting you up in a hotel and all that stuff   that's correct  ya   flying me down and everything fancy restaurants and all that   where you staying   uhm i don't know the name of the place actually  i haven't uh   probably not too fancy is my guess   well bring me back a black and white cookie   laugh from new york   laugh   that's the the the good  stuff that's   the good st stuff     black and white cookies   actually i sent tim stark there on a mission once to bring me back a black and white cookie and he couldn't find em them or he went to the wrong neighbourhoods and got them this these  italian cookies that weren't right  laugh   but if you know a new yorker they know what a laugh black and white cookie is  laugh   a black and white   it's just it's very new york  have you have you heard of the uhm what do they call him the soup nazi   the   ya on seinfeld  ya  apparently he's like a real   i guess is a word   he exists   he's a real person word   ya   anyway life imitates seinfeld  i'm not too sure you wanna want to do that   i'll see if i can find that guy too  laugh   but anyways you're going to be busy  ya   the the important thing in new york city is that you do your business and you don't look at people cos if you stop to observe the view you'll get mugged   laugh   laugh   right   that's my big worry  i've never been there before so   a few words it's cos  it's very it's a fast moving city  ya  it's too fast moving and that's the story is really uhm  keep your head up  ya   i was a victim there several years ago and it wasn't pleasing to go to the hospital  all this blood  and it's just they just wanted to make me bleed these guys  and uh that's what happens when you just sort of stop to to observe the traffic here  uncomfortable laugh hmm   right  so go there  you have a mission to go there and that's to stay alive laugh and get  out a few words   that's it   laugh sounds like a fun city laugh     take cabs if you can  ya  i often take the metro too  it's not such a bad system there  mhh okay  so what else is doing   cough   uhm on the trip you mean or just in general  ya   uhm i'm going to washington but my or   my boss is going to the shadow open market committee   meeting  uh huh   uhm and i'm just uh basically i'm   gonna going to be along for the ride just to see washington about three words   uh huh   so that'll be uh and that's it   so thursday friday saturday and i'll be back  word   ya i'm supposed to go to washington too  uh i was in invited down to the securities and exchange commission to give a talk and i m might be going down in  sniff in april   mh hmm   i like washington  i've never been there either   oh ya   laugh too much word   well you got to do the smithsonian museum when you're there and the the holocaust museum is really impressive and sort of being to different museums like that i could say mumbled words the one in washington is something that they really did ah an authentic job  on and it's a  right   well i've been to some of the or the  concentration camps in germany  i was at uh dachau   ya   i think it was dachau but   ya   phrase   well this this one gives you sort of an an american perspective of okay this is what they were doing in the states while it was  happening to and  just complete in indifference   uh huh   okay   and you see the original documents of uh the leaders in the states just   you know it was blatant  mh mhh  they were ready to blatantly participate in   in the murder that was going on  all right   anyways where do we got here on the markets today  they were down i saw  word was down about four points earlier on   uhm yield curve steepening   uh you know the two year's down ten ten  bibs i think today   uhm actually there's a huge ah rally bond rally  the long bond was doing well and then uh because  there was a ahh durable goods orders or something  uh huh   you probably don't remember off hand  well  anyways and it had just got erased  i think like the bond market's ready to start backing up   now anyways   where is it now   we can check out exactly where the market is  is happening  that network and i want nets  right there   there it is down there  get the uh p c close about two words    three or four words  about a fifteen minute delay on some of these things and  a few words   ya   do you trade the stock market now 
Canada	 well i i got back in  got some of this uh sierra online which you should buy  right   it's good stock  they make the king's quest and all these other things  what's that   oh right right   and it's been going up a lar   large   it went up uh ten bucks last week in one day from like   twenty-four dollars to thirty-four dollars  oh that's okay   tech stocks are really taking a hit today though  well ya  i b m was down about another four points  and i didn't check daq but we could  i own uh one called zyquest   uhm they make these uh removable uhm floppy drives basically  they're a hundred and twe twenty  a hundred and thirty-five megabyte floppies  it's canadian  no it's american  uh huh  it's on the nasdaq  uhm but there's two of them  there's iomega and zyquest and iomega i owned for awhile  tripled my money on it   floppy disks that you put into here and   look through it and five and a half   and they're a hund hundred   and thirty five or three and a or three and a quarter or three and a half inch ya and they're a hundred and thirty-five megabytes  so you could put everything on there  exactly   how much is one diskette though  uhm one diskette's around twenty dollars or so  that's pretty cheap   something l like   i i mean it's per per  megabyte that's pretty cheap  ya   that's pretty cheap eh especially if you  wanna want to put anything on there  exactly   word it's a lot faster to load and about four words   there's a it it's ah almost as fast as a hard drive too is the nice thing  uhm the  so it's th the disk drive  or a few words it needs a different   ya it it would look it looks  almost exactly like that   you need to change these the drives as well as there's special diskettes that you get   well ya like you would get  ya exactly   so how much does each diskette go for then   well that's that's   twenty about twenty dollars or so i think  the whole drive eh costs three hundred and fifty i think for the internal  uh huh  and it and it looks just  like a like that drive basically when you install it  but the special disks for it are twenty bucks twenty-five and it may store a hundred and thirty-five megabytes  there's another competitor though iomega  which whose stock is doing amazingly well  mhh hmm   where does it trade the daq   it's also on nasdaq  ah   uhm see the problem with zyquest is they have the better product but they're they got some yahoo running it and they're in financial troubles even though  it's the better product and iomega's  doing better   mhh hmm   so dow jones is really roller-coastering it today cos it was down   a lot and then then  it came back up and now it looks like it's up again  ya   right   a few words volatility   volatility's really high  ya   that's for sure  you should try

options here as well  but uh typing noise   cough   green means it's up  red means it's down  a lot of reds today   well earlier on but it's roller-coastering  ya   so there's probably a few words   ya g d g d a 's official position   is ah be in cash right now so  that's what g d a says who are down  fifty cents   ya   ya which is okay compared to the other tech stocks  well let's see  i b m was down as much as four bucks earlier typing noise   actually i o i own a put option on microsoft right now  oh that's a word   it's a it's a january   ninety-seven put <[though so i got   ya it's down three and three-eighths so it's coming back a little bit but it was down day as low as a hundred and seventeen after the previous close a hundred and twenty-two  laugh   so it's down as much as five and five-eighths  that's quite a bit  ya  this one the security a p l it gives you a link to ah i think it's m i t massachusetts institute of technology   uh huh  and the m i t any u s traded stock they give you a one year price history uh graph which is very nice if you just want to look at technicals or whatever  uhm okay here's what i'm hoping to do then  i'm gonna going to see if i can get say monday tuesday wednesday off from work uhm since it's not going to be intense  mhh hmm   so i'm gonna going to work the weekend and maybe monday tuesday wednesday and i can deliver you these first  two or three sections and then we can go from there i guess  okay   uhm so i'll get a copy of that and i will  photocopy those two articles for you and should be able to get them over today  okay great  so let's let's do that and  put an end to it  right   just taking a quick look through these uhm a lot of the stuff is badly outdated or one-sided or doesn't tell you that much about riel  so it's uh not really useful   no   and some of it like there's one i just wrote down  junk beside it  it's uh uhh le r&eacute;cit essentiel de l'histoire du quebec by laurent belanger who taught here  it was a huge selling book  uh it sold i forget how many hundred thousand copies but it was absolute crap  major errors of of fact in every paragraph  guy doesn't know what he was talking about  no  is that uh uh from a nationalist standpoint or something  but   it was kind of nationalist uhm socialist revolutionary   and he wrote history the way it should have happened in his view  not not the way it did happen and it's  it's not very good  oh ya   the uh one of the problems is that everybody who studies riel sees a different person  and what happens is you know people have their own agendas  uh and so they want to see riel as what they want to see  mhh hmm   so for the protestants of ontario for example   whose view was that the french and the m&eacute;tis everybody else had no right to be in the west then the thing to do  obviously riel was a villain   mhh   and uh so one of the first ones they get is the man who had to hang history by e.b. osler and it comes out  that uh cough in that history louis riel hangs scott because scott had won the heart of a woman that riel loved  which is pure nonsense  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   no such thing ever happened uhm  ah uh that's funny  you know in in in uh that's actually mentioned in  the this book that i had the the little green one from ah an unknown author  ya   that's probably the one  ya it's  by osler  ya  ya you get that  you get  uhm generally speaking english-speaking protestants saw him as a villain cos he's expanding word canada's westward plans in making the west english and protestant so he's a villain  mhh hmm  ehm among the french quebecois he becomes a hero  and and the peculiar thing is they did not consider him a hero in eighteen seventy  they didn't consider him a hero in eighteen eighty-five   well because stanley actually says that he  he got a lot of support from quebec  not not right away  nobody goes out to help him  there's no speeches in the house of commons for him  there's no rallies   when when they come over to riel  and you know  and and and and lately quebec nationalists talk about how quebec was always attached to him how he was fighting to build a french nation on the plains  ya   he was not fighting to do any such thing  no  french quebec would have been as big an enemy to him as english ontario  but he gets translated into this guy   and the tr translation   the moment of translation comes not in eighteen eighty-five it's eighteen eighty-seven   in eighteen eighty-seven the court hangs him  mhh hmm  and the reason they hang him is not because he was a rebel   it's because he killed scott and he was a french   cat catholic french-speaking catholic   in the view of english canada this was a warning to french quebec to stay in its place  mhh hmm  that's the point at which french quebec reacts   and embraces him  mhh hmm   that's when you have rallies in montreal and you have laurier  saying you know if i had been on the plains i would have shouldered a musket to fight with louis riel   well nothing was stopping him from doing it  he didn't do it  mhh hmm  it's eighteen eighty-seven with the execution   uh and then you get westerners most of them the decendents of the english protestants who hated riel they suddenly in the last thirty years began to see him as a hero because they hate the east and he's the symbol of westerns who   ya they were being ripped off by the railroad and everything   ya   ya   and then he gets picked up by the unions because they see him as the symbol of the working man struggling against big business  he wasn't a unionized working man  he wasn't a socialist nor was he particularly interested in big business one way or the other  mhh   they all invent this hero  he becomes a hero to the indians cos they perceive him as the native fighting against  and and he becomes perceived as  as by natives and m&egrave;tis generally as the man who was fighting for them   and they perhaps are a little bit closer to the truth  but he becomes   mhh  he is it does have a certain resonance with the with them you know like   maybe two words   he is the all-purpose hero or the all-purpose villain depending on where you're starting and that's what makes him such a central figure in canadian history  but what gets lost is precisely what you're doing what was it that riel was asking   it's the simplicity of it i guess 
Canada	 so how are you ladies     oh okay laugh   things are running along smoothly     mm hmm   mm hmm  carrie what happened this morning   i had a very good day  good unclear words   i just had uhm

the parents   that's great  you know  word knock at the door   come in  feel like a teacher brief conversation between extra-corpus visitor and speaker a, about 25 seconds   lynda how was your week

for another semester  that's right  i i mean i like the grade two teacher very much as a person but not to be in a classroom laugh  and that's  and you're entitled  that's right     you're entitled to feel that way three people speak at once and someone coughs near the mic   you know what  we'll leave it as as is  mm hmm   we're happy with things as they are   and uh and that'll be just fine  yes

finishing on the nineteenth   ya ya yeah i know i   word   yeah   so you're just gonna going to sort of flow right into laugh starts i  laugh ends   it's alright it's   into the next one  it's not a big deal  yeah it'll be fine  yeah  it'll be fine  okay annabelle   sure   what's happening   oh i'm floating i'm group laughs   i'm having a blast  yeah  today we were scientists  how was the birdwatching unit  oh great  we did an experiment today   and uh i was teaching them how ducks are waterproof and  they don't get wet  and i have this book called ducks don't get wet   and there's a little experiment in the book  mumbled one or two words   so what i did at first i mixed uhm ah gree  green ah pff blue water with yellow water  and i told them i said what do you think will happen if i  blend these two together  will they mix  will i get like blue and yellow and they're like no you'll get green you silly others laugh   like they're saying silly but they were looking at me as if i'm stupid others laugh   so we did that i said okay our predictions were good and i was telling them that scientists make predictions and   so i said well here i have another bottle of water and they said put red red so i put in red dye   and then uhm i had oil   i said this is oil  feel it and we're all touching the oil and we all like  we all like greasy hands and i said do you think the water and the oil will mix  oh yes yes yes  i said you sure like you won't get water and then a strip of  oil and  so we made i had a prediction sheet and i ticked off we said yes they all said yes laugh   and then i said nobody's saying no you know  so i didn't put my no i just left it like that   and then course it didn't mix and then i read them the book and they had to uh draw oh i've got it with me laugh i'm so proud of it others laugh   well i photocopy everything they do in their bird journal right   and so they had to draw the experiment  ducks don't get wet because their feathers are covered with oil  we did a science experiment and discovered that water and oil do not mix   isn't that nice   mm and uh of course i had this made up  others laughter starts before the experiment others laughter ends   and then this is my picture of our science experiment  the photocopier kinda kind of cut it off  so i had the bottle on the table and they just sat around in a circle   just drawing the bottle and   that's neat   so that was really fun   let's see the journal  that's cute  oh uhm  that's mine   this is a math one that i did  they just had to count and then write how many  y you know what  you can take these ideas and use them  with any theme  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   yeah  oh  yeah  and then oh yes   if i could be a bird i would be a   he said a blue jay and  he told me  he didn't feel like writing it down so i tried but he told me because i like bluejays so i wrote it for him  and then this is another one where they all  each child had a strip of ten birds  mm hmm  i think you saw this one word       mm hmm 
Canada	 and when you come across it when you're dealing with that  you come across the problem of riel's limited understanding   you also come across the question of his sanity  mhh hmm  and the question of sanity is not an easy one because here again if you study it you are studying it as a twentieth century   what are you  protestant  catholic  i'm protestant  how devout are you   mhh i have no relationship to   under twentieth century  okay   ya   so if i tell you that god sends angels to talk to me  how are you going to react to that   i i'd be sceptical to   to say the least   to say the least   ya  i'd  if you came to my office and i sat here and said you know i was talking to god about you yesterday god sent this angel he said i want you to help this guy dan out you'd give me a real  fish look  laugh   mhh  now it's not  well that's that's no that you know that's not really all that crazy compared to you know people   a few words   that's not crazy at all  born-again christians talk like that  word they're hearing him all the time  you know/[2>  exactly   exactly   and if this were the fourteenth century and you're  two words class you're growing up in a different world  you believe in angels  you believe that god talks to people  so i say this and you say ya it makes sense you know  mhh   and and so one of your problems is that you yourself are studying riel in a kind of world that he didn't really live in  mhh hmm  uhm i'm not saying that angels did talk to him  i'm just saying that just how quickly you dismiss it depends on who you are   so that's the kind of a problem that you have to face  and what i've suggested is that you look at the books the first the most up-to-date scholarship and uh because   the up-to-date stuff some of it has most of it has included the earlier stuff so there's no point  reinventing the wheel  uh huh   i've also suggested you look at the poetry of  of louis riel because you don't really you know learn much of this guy  there's not much in the way of of his evidence and what he thought  we just have tangled bits conversations remembered by other people and it's it's very hard to piece   em them together  ya  i took down the diaries of louis riel there too so  hopefully that'll   ya   maybe i missed those but ya hopefully that'll   provided it's an a few words a reliable translation  oh i'm sorry  this telephone rings the  diary's by thomas flanagan  ya it's   hello  yes   uh huh   that'll be okay   laugh okay   yes that's okay  sure   okay   sorry   no it's okay telephone conversation   ehm some of the books just aren't very good  uhm louis david riel prophet of the new world by flanagan  flanagan is the most contentious one who argues the case of louis riel   uh george uh stanley i have down because he is the standard  his book now is uh over forty years old but it's still   the the basic one  $b> holds up   ya  uhm maggie higgins probably a reference to maggie siggins: canadian writer and journalist because it's it's   quite recent and  this is riel life of of uh revolution  thomas flanagan again uh and then the selected poetry of louis riel   and i did there's one book which is a book of readings by hartwell bowsfield   oh here we are  i include that because it's just a selection of a lot of stuff  now how many sources are you normally expected to consult for this  uh well it's twenty to twenty-five pages officially so  uhm i guess uh three per page  i've got quite a quite a you know  quite a lot of space to play with   well i don't look at it that way  laugh i i the only reason i    ya   i'm really asking this i guess because of other people  i mean i i think that people invent a magic number of sources that you're supposed to have  i i think you need to have what you need in order to do a workmanlike  job of whatever you're doing and what you need depends on what there is and how much there is   uh huh   ya   that's quite a bit  see you have to have a general impression of   not just of telephone rings riel but  oh jeez   hello   ya   still going   no   laugh okay telephone conversation   uh you you need a general impression of his world the attitudes of other people to put it in the context to see what what he's working in  and then you have to have a range of opinion of riel  uh i mean uh stanley's is is  essentially that riel was what he calls a near-great   that is a person who becomes famous a person who comes close to accomplishing something but is missing those real qualities that take you over the top  hmm  in short he sees him essentially as a second rate man  placed into a first rate situation  hmm  uhh i one two three four five six seven that gives you a pretty solid core to work on  i've stayed away from stuff which deals too much  like the execution of thomas scott  well   ya i don't i really don't think so   i think you'll come across that in other stuff  uhm unlike most people i don't have trouble with him executing thomas scott   ya he wa was he  sou sounds sounds  like he deserved it anyway  pardon   he richly deserved it and riel was trying to hang on to a very volatile situation  he was very young  he could have lost control of the m&eacute;tis at any time  uh i think that executing thomas scott obviously works against him in the long run but at the time i could see it  i don't think it's it's a foolish decision  uhm so if you work on those   actually do the ones i've checked off  kay okay   now what we're doing for this  you have to clarify me again  this is the preparation for the  this is the historiography ya  you're doing a course now  yes this is i'm doing ah three ninety-seven with geraldino   it's ah the honours seminar  ya   it's meant to to help prepare us for the writing the honours essay  and beside  well besides that we do we do some other things like uh an an analysis   an analysis of primary documents on the belcher island murders and readings and historiography  okay so you're concentrating on riel's goals or as close to as you can figure out to what on earth they must have been  yes   uhm   which as far as i can see he was trying to get a better deal for the m&eacute;tis within the canadian confederation   that's what he was doing in eighteen seventy   mhh hmm  i'm not sure that's what he was trying to do in eighteen eighty-five   and that's when you raise the whole question of his sanity when you look at  cos what he was what he was trying to do in eighteen seventy was clearly just to get a better deal   but in eighteen eighty-five he appears to have had a vision of what the west should be  hmm   that's not quite the same as just getting a deal out of canada   no it's not no  and in fact what he had in mind is something that would have required a very high degree of independence in the west  so uh ya okay   okay i'll i'll read that section more closely then  inhale ya  i think you have to make a distinction between  a and i'm guessing  ah maybe maybe i'm wrong and maybe we'll find out that there's a consistency in what he was looking for  and i i won't i don't want to prejudice that  uhh uh okay so you're gonna going to  your your job then for me is to produce a paper i presume on the bibliography  yes ju just   on uh on the sources here ah   and how long does this bibliography  is there a specified length  he   let's see   he says uh twenty to twenty-five pages  for the bibliography or the thesis  for the uh for the historiography  really  ya   i understand other profs have have  turned it down but it's it's up to you  okay here's   i i would   he said twenty to twenty-five  ya  here it is   okay i don't want to see more than twenty-five  uh twenty twenty uh and i would think that it should  here's what i'd like to see in it  first a quick outline of the events uh with a  suggestion of why it is that you're studying this  what is it you're looking for  okay   follow that by by giving a brief outline of the major differences in the way people perceive riel   how how how stanley has perceived him how flanagan et cetera  so you find out where the areas of controversy are   then one at a time you deal with each item in your bibliography  you summarize it and then you comment on it which  gives another raising criticisms about it  drawing attention to the strengths of it and raising questions about it  are there questions it leaves unanswered  are there areas that you would liked to have seen explored in each case  hmm   and do them one at a time that way   kay okay   uh and i think that should do it  okay well   and when shall i see this  uhm it's uh due on the twelfth  uh that's when uh geraldino uh wants to have it   but he said uhm as late as the uh uh third week of  of april is okay  so i guess if i have it by to you by   about the twelfth  okay   that'll give you a few days to mark it  about two words   about three words ya  ya  okay great  and then i'll uh i'll come by with ah a rough draft or something just ah to make sure i'm on the right track  i asked you before about your accent didn't i  ya i'm from vancouver  that's right okay   ya   is that just vancouver though   uhh i don't know  it's western canadian i guess   sounds a bit ottawa valley  really  ya  a little bit  oh well i've mh got a welsh and scottish background so maybe that's got something to do with it   well maybe more of the welsh than the scottish ya  is it that close the the background  uhm well let's see  my my grandmother on my mom's side was english and uh my my grandpa was   was welsh but on my my dad's side it's only my uhh actually my great cough  grandparents that were from the old world so not too close  ya   usually   have you spent have you spent  any time over on the west coast before or  no  what i've heard of the accent  course of course so many people don't come from there  it's ah pssh   ya it's a new  but i know the american west coast tends to be bland and fairly close to you know montreal english  ya  uh   ya it's funny i can't i can't tell much of a difference between californians and  and uh and british columbians  it's i mean there's actually a stronger accent in washington state than than in in than  farther south  ya  uh some things you say i would've sworn maritimes  mhh  when you had said british columbians and went up at the end i thought wow that's nova scotia laugh   laugh   uh that's interesting  okay  you've got a good ear for for  accents  well the greatest one i've ever had was i was   i was registering a girl and i said gee your accent has me puzzled because it's it's jewish but it's not montreal jewish and there's a touch of scandinavian  and she said well my father's from israel and my monther's from norway laugh   ahh   couldn't get much different eh   ya   okay  okay  so great  uhm ya i'll talk to you in about a week or so and let you how i'm doing  okay  i hope to get this thing on the road pretty fast  it's we don't have much time so 
Canada	 so why don't we start with larry   do you have any additional comments uh to what you or   word   uhm well not not  much really  it was just in the end you uh mentioned that uh there should be a systems component in the uh uhh the systems component in our curriculum was important that there should be one and uhm i didn't see much uhh evidence of that being needed in here and i wondered if you had any comments on that   uh the uhm the the reason why  i'm i'm convinced and i i'm  convinced very strongly that there needs to be a systems component  that is emphasized in the program is because the the  the conversational models of the cree communities are  inherently intrinsically circular and th  this to me represents a kinda  kind of almost a quintessential cybernetic kind of  uhh model  we're dealing with uh feedback of of  huge variety where there are traditional control mechanisms  where there are uhm where there is at least uhh when you look below the surface there are a huge uhm variety of of  perceptions that need to be accommodated uh not according to a right-wrong black-white this-or-that kind of model which  it it uh which in my opinion is still fairly prevalent in many educational models where there seems to be often a right way as opposed to ah a wrong way  and and uh i i  think systems design helps people to   are you saying you did some kind of an informal systems model in your head about what you were encountering   yes  yes i did  because i was always ver very  uhm i was thinking about the uh i was trying very hard in that con context   in those contexts those six different contexts to think about the the forest without losing sight of the trees and vice versa  uhh to me systems design facilitates that kind of thinking which is macro-micro uh simultaneously  uh uhh such that i didn't want to simply focus on the boxes   filling in the boxes or on the other hand focusing on an abstract kind of global vision   mh hmm   both are important and i don't think it is possible to  to accommodate one without referring to the other  uh one acts as a check on the other  uh they go hand in hand  uh uhh th that's why i i'm i i feel very strongly about the systems design   maybe four words   right  okay   cos one particular uh feldman he said  that it didn't make his statement that uh uhm   ya   well my uhm only uh uh   well there was that technical comment i made before about  the document about where you have number of years uh in your   uhm in your uh histograms there uh that it should indicate that those are number of man-years  because quite often one thinks of number of years of training required as being one two three four five or something like that and then you see the sixty or seventy or a hundred and twenty it's a bit of a something  or other   mh hmm   mh hmm   mh hmm   and uhm uhh for the most part it seems much  nice clean relevant word  document but it it would be very nice if the in-depth interviews could stay in whatever form of the document uh is  is put on the shelf     cough   i gather many of your appendices can't  throat clearing   is that correct  well the the in-depth interviews uhm uh they could stay i i guess if i just delete the names uh maybe the names  and the communities   mh hmm     mh mh   because i found them very helpful in getting more perspective  on what   mh hmm   mh hmm   absolutely   partial comment   phrase   ya  ya  ya they were uh i found them quite exciting actually that people would would talk to me about those those kinds of things  we certainly don't need the names and/or the communities   word the two words   no no   word the names   phrase   mh hmm   mh hmm   but clearly a lot of the the  tabulated data here  ugh without uhh without leaving some locations it isn't very meaningful  and anyway it's it's the sort of thing that you can't really read without using some technique of analysis  so there there's not much   difference  mh hmm   mh hmm it's uhm  that would solve the dilemma i've been having too  it's is there's a lot of rich of course data that's useful to to  other students and uh and   laugh and professors  mh hmm   mh hmm   if we could judiciously perhaps uh cull this or  or perhaps just include a sampling  five or   ten uh that would reduce the size of the  the appendix uh  appendices word   mh hmm   mh hmm     yes ya   and then we could put the whole thing in  if that is allowable  i think it probably it probably  would be  maybe we could include one community but then we'll leave the name of the community   sure   so in in a sense   but you don't   one doesn't one doesn't need all the details  i mean all the these   pounds and pounds of forms filled in  ya   uh one one dummy form i mean  without without real names or something like that  would  be enough   for uh to give an idea of  word as a  sample   mh hmm   agreement   mh hmm   comment   just a sample exactly   agreement   which i thought was uhm but they are important because you've taken a uh an  unusual approach to the way you've tangled your interviews and incorporated them and so uh uhh it is important for you to have some conception of how you've tabulated that   mh hmm   okay  tina   word excuse me  comment   word two words laugh   oh laugh   i see  you said both   laugh   comment   comment     mh hmm lengthy question by extra-corpus speaker with a few interjections by others ( affirmations and clarifications). continues for 1m 45sec.   right right  i think that's there the list of of  seventeen of the of the total   co competencies thirty-five competencies   ya   partial comment   three words sentence continues  sentence continues   a few words   mh hmm   well this i found   t this i found u   useful   i do don't   uh this is m mcg mcgucken   i don't know mcgu mcgucken   clarification   i'm not sure if i or   comment     mcgeeghan there is it  clarification   mcgeeghan   clarification     what do you think   mcgeeghan would be  word know if i'm pronouncing it  properly     ya     uhm ya   of those of those  thirty-five the seventeen are ones she identifies as for the   uh those doing needs analysis  and uhm wh when i look  at this at this list i i i  think that this is a very this is very  useful this  it's a good inventory of of skills   that that people need  uh i found myself lacking somewhat in in  the business understanding because i i   am not and have never been an entrepreneur  and and entrepreneurship is one of those things i think people need to do in order to to to  get some kind of a handle on this because it's kind of   it's grassroots business  and i don't have that background  uh my computer competence is is very limited  it's an area that i need to to work on because i found that the the the shape of many reports now and the design of reports the planning of reports very much nowadays depends to a very large extent on on   the the abilities of the team members to produce documents in this in in this way  uh the the so it's no   i i think it the the   co computer the computer  technology is in a in a sense less of an extension of our ability uhh than it used to be  it is i th think   it seems to be very very much a part of who we are in terms of planning ah and designing analyzing implementing strategies and so on  and my computer competencies are lacking there  uhm   word sentence continues   sentence   sentence   sentence   mh hmm   uhm i would say uhm data reduction skill is is  is very important  uhm because as soon as we start to eliminate we could lose the richness  agreement   and it takes a certain skill to know not what to include but to know in a sense know what to   exclude  and that's i found is quite tricky  partial sentence   uhm the uh i think  intellectual versatility is uhm is very uh useful in this  uh it's very very important uhm because it it's   it creates an openness to whatever you  you're confronted with  it's uh to uh eliminate certain biases  uhm or if i can overuse that word mitigates against certain biases  uh uhm uhm performance observation skill i think is one thing that is under-represented in some of the things that we do  uhm i found i learned a lot by observing in in   in the context by watching how people operated with their with the hard copy material that they use with the technology that they use and how they interacted with each other   uh and that i tried to factor into into   the data production  uhm relationship building skill i think is in aboriginal context absolutely critical  if it's not there the the system shuts down and then you get yes/no answers to the questions uh or i don't know which is death to a needs assessment  all right  to to ask a question and two words say i don't know   that may be true of course but one doesn't want that answer too often  uhm   two words sentence continues   sentence   the question yes that that's  true  uhm uh uh and as i mentioned in earlier   i i tried to have a conversation and not an interview  uhm so that's all frequently i found myself diverging from my my task and i would talk about children  i would talk about weather  uhm uh i'd talk about some you know some   benign political event if there is such a thing uh that that  or something in the news  uh in a sense just if i thought that it was a way of building a relationship so that i could come back to the question  because it's uh i was very sensitive of the fact that people don't like to answer these kinds of questions  so i tried to build  i don't know if i succeeded  but i tried to build relationships however that's possible in a few minutes that i had with people  sentence   voiced pause   presentation of self really i guess was important  from what you said too  you're saying that the way you moved and the way that you  uh uh way you dressed  presumably also was something that blended in possibly  mh hmm   mh hmm   yes i was very conscious of of not  of trying not to be in a rush  uh that's uh uh that's very  imp important very important    now th th that's  difficult because there my time was constrained  i had to collect a lot of data in a short period of time  and of course that creates uh uhm uh a stressful situation being in a rush  so i found that i would get data whenever i could  so i would go out at ni night  i would plan the data collection so that i coud hit two or three people in a d&eacute;panneur at nine o'clock at night rather than during the day when band office was open but what would be closed closed at night  so i would try and catch people whenever i  whenever i could   need to be sort of be laid back about it  extremely laid back  it's absolutely absolutely essential in this context  to be uh to to be laid back   sentence   sentence   sentence   sentence   no it's not captured in this list  this is a discrete list of of of  competencies  uhm uhm i i i think uh uhm uh a sense of curiosity is extremely important in in  collecting data  just just for the heck of it  agreement   just to enjoy being curious uh to me is is   is important  uhm and and a lot falls out of that  agreement   uh being curious just naturally leads one to  to collect   okay  whether it's rocks or information it doesn't matter  it it i think it does lead a person to collect and uh uhh th that's very important  uh uhm i think it's also important  and i i don't wanna  want to sound too schmaltzy but i think it's important to love people period   agreement 
Canada	 mm hmm  actually he is taking a course now  so then it's word applicable  okay   breath uhm we're gonna going to  call that uhh contribution from equity laugh   i'm not sure quite what the terminology is i'm just gonna  going to show you my startup costs  mm hmm  uhh but before we get to that uhm we're going to be sort of earmarking ten thousand dollars for this   and i put it in as a contribution from equity   okay  uhh do i have to calculate an opportunity cost for that it's still like in say term deposits and it's in terms it's not like sitting there doing nothing in a bank  right   do you guys need to purchase assets   that's basically what it's is  used for  yeah yeah   so you're taking ten thousand dollars and purchasing assets with the ten thousand dollars  well four or five words installation of the phone and everything that's gonna going to   two words in june or july  from a financial perspective you wouldn't take into consideration opportunity costs  the opportunity costs would come into play before you made the decision to go in business  that is to say i have ten thousand dollars should i start a business or should i put it in the bank you know what i m   right   that that and so what you do is look at the interest rates available in the bank and then say well if i go in business here's what i project  so you already have based on your performance a certain amount of projections which take into account the opportunity costs  okay  so in other words let's assume your return on investment is  gonna going to be twenty percent in the business when all is said and done  so if you were to put it in the bank you might get like eight percent  so in essence   one or two words laugh  ehhh i know  and so in essence the difference is what you gained in opportunity costs  yeah  so that but that's a background uhm  that's an internal controlling uh mechanism that's not anything to do with necessarily uh the financial it doesn't have to be reported in the financial statements and so on and so forth  yeah   the opportunity cost of money in this case is just a question of should i or shouldn't i from a financial perspective to see if it's worthwhile  th that is a decision that's had in the decision making before you go into business   right  but now that you've already invested in the business it's already established  speaker b continues talking as speaker z interrupts - private discussion lasts for about one minute   okay so i wanna want to take into consideration this opportunity cost because in fact my word  really don't exceed anything i could get at the bank  right  and that's that's there's this   i mean   i mean word mutual funds is not   a sure thing  i mean entrepreneurship is not a decision you always make on a basis of uh financials but basically that's part of the the  the myth of an investor  okay  in other words if you said to me wanna want to put ten thousand dollars into my company then i'm concerned in terms of my opportunity cost  in other words like i could get seven percent say what could i get from you sorta sort of thing  okay   is it too late for you to look at a draft  no  i would have loved to have gotten one to you before you left but i really was not able to do that   no it d i can do  uh   i can have that for wednesday  if i get it to you   sure  cos uh cos i can work on it tonight or tomorrow and uh i can give you some feedback  so i could go make these corrections that i had from the weekend   mmm you made some word   and yeah yeah yeah no you don't wanna  want to edit this  no i'll fix it   print you off a better copy   uhm this is what i wanted to just show you my startup costs   sure i'll give you a good i can give you some feedback on it before you uh  when are you presenting  two or three words   wednesday  oh this wednesday right  so that's okay   because that will give you time  well just i'm constrained by the fact that my computer at home is incompatible with these here at school  oh  and the school is closed for four days   that's true two words   so i have to finish it on thursday and do like little cosmetics on tuesday and that's it  hmm mm hmm  it's out there laugh   wow  breath so  well uhh it's uh   some of us are   i'll long, drawn out 'i' have your feedback on wednesday on your written  not too short notice  no no no  and you're gonna going to get feedback on wednesday for your oral presentation from myself and the students  okay  so then we that will give you the opportunity to   fine tune it  fine tune it  because then breath the following wednesday is the last day  is that how it works out   mm hmm   so coming back on that last wednesday that's when it's actually due  right  but really whatcher what you're  looking there is cosmetic changes and you know uhhh an alteration or an addition of a paragraph here or there  okay  i've written it in the first person is that alright?  yep that's fine  sure it should be  okay   okay  i mean it has more power in first person  word   i thought maybe it was less businesslike but  that's it's something that i care personally about  and it just came that way  oh yeah   unclear utterance   unclear utterance   you see there were   if you were writing it as a business proposal kay  okay then it would be more appropriate to be in the third person  okay  when you do an entrepreneurship case it should be in first person because you are the key element  right  i mean you are the entrepreneur you are the business  and so the business word is first person you lose a lot of credibility as in well say you know this is an opportunity uh someone could do this or do that and then it doesn't have the power or the impact of saying here's what i'm gonna going to do  that that sorta sort of   thing  okay  so i i i think the first person is most word   kay okay   this is similar to something that was set up in the book   i don't know if this is what you're looking for  uhh projected sources of startup   sources of startup funds   so this is what we have now and then this is gonna  going to come from that ten thousand dollar investment that we're making  mm hmm   and you assets that you're presently putting in the business  yes  so in essence your total contribution will be this plus this  right  uhh the ten thousand dollars then is the total  it's an acculmulation that  this ten or the other ten  yes   no this ten  that's the total of these two  right  so that's tha when you're talking terms of ten thousand dollars you're talking about five and five  or roughly five and five  yeah   five thousand dollars is   like we have five now we're  gonna going to put another five in   your computer and uhh your computer this that and you're gonna going to  put five thousand in cash  and then i have another five thousand still earmarked  oh okay uh uh i must've  contingency fund  right mm hmm which is perfect  this is great   do you need to see contingency fund anywhere  well normally it has it in startup costs as a twenty percent addition  okay  and it's at the end of all your startup costs you  you just put on a twenty percent for contingencies  another twenty percent   that way it covers everything that now you see  what you forgot  okay  so in uh in essence you've already accounted for an overrun  and then you can make a a point in your financials in the in the word  essay descriptive portion to say that in essence you'll have another five thousand dollars on the sidelines that you would not  prefer to put in the business at this time but it will be available in the uh   yeah   to fall back on  yeah mm hmm  okay  and you just for whatever reason don't wanna  want to put it in right now  kay okay and the statement of assets could i make it april first  statement of assets uhh the assets that you started right   difference of the balance sheet and it was   yeah  yeah and so sure your startup date can be whenever you selected could be 'select it' as the startup date  april first is fine  okay  mmm then i'll do the word in the end december thirty-first  right because you're you've got a  word fiscal uh laugh you can't go a laugh  no you can't change that after   word march thirty-first then because now you're restricted  is that just quebec or is that a canadian thing  i think that's  federal or  i'll make sure  i know it's quebec  yeah because i know then that used to be the opportunities and you could work and create your own fiscal year  juggle it around a bit   okay  what companies can't do that in there either it's not just a question of startups or small business  no it's everyone  everyone  so even large corporations and everything hafta  have to go to a calendar year  hmm  i guess there were too many little loopholes  yeah well for sure  it's also really difficult for them probably to keep track of everything  yeah mm hmm   they have everyone with different year ends  right  okay  so that's it you're all set for wednesday  okay   kay okay   sigh   so tell me in in relation to uhm you know what we talked about last week you know with the  word and the word and the larger one you know we talked about the finishes  mm hmm  like i'm wondering if you could tell me your response to the drawing in you know in the context of some of the things that we spoke about  sniff mkay okay   uhhm i dunno don't know i had a lot of problems with just figuring out what background i wanted to put with this  mm hmm  i ended up uhh i dunno don't know   trying to figure out where i was gonna going to  put the lettering and the words and stuff like that and what kind of  like you were telling me the content you know and what words i   kinda kind of wanna want to  add to the drawing and stuff like that and should it have meaning and stuff  mm hmm  and i think the thing the most that i'm doing right now is just having fun with the idea of playing with the f the   the kitschiness of the movie posters and stuff like that and the objects  mm hmm  but also uh i dunno don't know  exploring the idea of yeah how to composition and the medium  i think i'm really starting to enjoy like   so you're really getting involved in the formal aspect of the work through an i the image that interests you  but right now like right now your concerns are really about the handling the materials the colours you know word placings the composition  yeah yeah   so in fact your concern is very formal in the work  yeah more formal than i would say like thinking about i  dunno don't know uhh if i'm trying to get a certain meaning across or anything like that  mm hmm  i'm not really dealing with that as much as i think  just having fun with the idea that you know i enjoy the uhh just the nostalgia feel of even these posters   mm hmm   like i can remember when i was five years old looking at them  and going oooh the spacey you know eerie greens and stuff like that  mm hmm   so they're kind of memory images too  uhm yeah i would say so yeah i would say so very much  like you know watching you know wolfman as a kid you  know or dracula with bela lugosi be like oh my god nightmares for  you know days on end but  uh huh   right   so you're crea recreating  a time and a space that you were in   pretty much in a sense yeah   when you were a child  yeah well also with the objects kind of relating back to that too you know like i dunno don't know if the the wax candle owl you know signifies i dunno don't know  uhm well i guess in a sense it signifies you know memories and stuff like that cos why would i take these objects 
Canada	 to to go into this context and say  well these are these are these are  really interesting human beings who are very much on the surface  if you can if they trust you   and there therefore there's ah an opportunity to to learn from  from what it is that they they have   to to say  uhm wh when  when people   uhh there was one person who who   i found this quite interesting who who   said to me  this was kind of an off-hand comment you know  said you know these missionaries got it all wrong about  uh about us cree people  they thought we worshipped a whole bunch of different gods but in fact we don't  we just worship the creator through creation  and i thought to myself this is a very interesting model cos i certainly wasn't taught this model when i was a kid  this is a very valuable kind of sharing of of  perceptions  uhm and it was those kinds of conversations   where i where i think it's possible to   to build bridges between cultures and and  instead of end up in a confrontational situation where we're negotiating for land for money and uhh this kind of thing     cough   uhm we've negotiated for for land with the the cree people and many other groups in canada but in fact current research says that more jobs can be created through conservation than through the development of megaprojects   these are sustainable jobs for the long-haul  and conservation's best done by the people on the spot  mhh hmm   ya   mhh hmm   now they would prefer having mini-dams in their communities  for example  uh this would these they would be much more environmentally-friendly  they could manage them themselves without sophisticated computer technology   and uhm the they and they for in terms of   conservation for conservation they would be able to provide more people with work  and and we would provide more people in the south with work through conservation than through developing  these project   is there a a uhm a  good feeling about their population explosion or are they worried about it  are they happy about having all these babies or are  are they worried about  they are they are worried about it  they're cer certainly  they're on the one hand they're happy about having all the babies  uh though they're both  they're happy about having them and they're also worried about what it is they're  going to do uh uhh because they're drifting away from subsistence forms of life a few mumbled words     cough     maybe three words   which todd and uhh  todd at mcgill tobin todd the anthropologist says needs to be looked at uh because of the uh opportunities for harvesting different forms of wildlife to provide uh jobs   okay  it it's also uhh it's also compatible with job-sharing concepts  where people could actually share the same job and part of the time hunt and part of the time work in an office  uh this would fit in ve very   extremely neatly with their with their seasonal uh pursuits   because when when goose break is on  there's no point sending a consultant up north cos they're   they're not there  they're they're out in the bush  which is where they prefer to be i think i suppose  word very much  i felt uh uhm  sorry  uh on you   exclamation two words   ya   a couple of uh  i thought an interesting uhm observation on the point on page twenty-two where when you're estimating   obviously we always run into this in business education  how do you estimate the cost-effectiveness of business education versus traditional     mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and you uh this  struck me in the audit a good estimate of the  full cost of the purchase time is roughly three times his or her direct salary costs   mhh hmm  oh my gosh  that is cos normally as you say the the  direct cost and add on something quite a few words  but three times     cough   it seems to me a a very   maybe three words   it seems two words but when we factor in cough not only benefits but but  also uhm uh time lost uh for when people are absent from work  uh there are a variety of variables that go into the equation as far as i've been able to tell  i see   partial sentence two words   partial sentence   two words   right   it's that high is it    agreement   mhh hmm   ya   word sentence continues   three words     mhh hmm   so let's say w we'll just take a salary of a professor  what is it the average of seventy word   mhh hmm  so you walk in hire that person for a year we would budget two hundred and seventy thousand dollars  should  one of the reasons we don't function properly laugh   is that they don't budget that much and consequently we don't have the support and capabilities     mhh hmm   mhh hmm  but that's a societal cost  i mean the organization itself would not reap that  or or rather the the loss to the organization like the university and so on   isn't that isn't that   the replacement cost you're looking at here   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   the   s uh yes   it seems to me that maybe the the   the sort of global cost but   yes that's that's the  that's the global cost   or the societal cost that you know  because there is a when we do a  full costing that's what it comes up to  as as when we uhh consider the full cost of of a particular industry  we don't te we tend not to factor in cost to the environment or cost to health as a result of the existence of that particular industry  hmm   but that's not there's no full costing there  we do that we're trying to do that in education   and it's the formula is  it's complicated  right     exactly   okay bottom-line would government uh  contractors accept that kind of uh presentation of personnel  costs  cough   oh ya i doubt it  i i doubt it very seriously  yup  it's uh uh me too   laugh that's what word   laugh     cough   a few words societal versus the actual  a few words mumbled   this is is is  excluding ex externalities is it  sort of  ya   uh oh no  no i uh obviously that's a whole complicated subject according to word   so what would about what would you as a universilalia management consultant put in for uhm a a consultant to do a needs assessment for example   how would what kind of   oh well oh obviously they negotiate  mhh hmm   but if they took you out of the university and the university were given replacement costs  and let's say your salary here was seventy thousand dollars  and you were contracted for a year would they simply add the seventy plus the fifteen percent or whatever it is  overhead  and and put another twenty  percent  uh i get you   cough   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   p p probably     i i believe that that's what they do   ya so you you   okay so i am right in that  you know   mhh hmm  i shouldn't be uh maybe two words    actually you'd never expect uh that amount to be budgeted in the contract  right   that's right  exactly   mhh hmm   sentence   sentence   three words three words  sentence continues     mhh hmm   sentence   sentence   sentence   sentence   oh as a consultant yes  in negotiating yes maybe two words something else  sure   okay okay   when we look at the the  full cost multiplier  particularly in public  institutions we have to look at the   a cost of maintaining the office the person uses for example  ya   that's a big two words   agreement   cough   cough   building of the office in the first place  uh much of what the provincial government looks at is square  feet per individual working  that's often their bottom line     uh huh   and that's one of the problems that in fact that concordia's had at loyola  because concordia will say we have this much  this many square feet and the government will say you don't need anymore but so much of the loyola space is not usable     mhh hmm     mhh hmm  it it's uhh built on   a few words   and they're word for the  amount of space that uh a faculty member needs are  ridiculous to my word   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   ya so there are not   you cannot assume that one has a library or a  a few words   i can see that     word   it doesn't work word  failure   agreement   so there are so many things that are factored into  that in into  that and uh it is a cost somewhere     mhh   agreement   somebody has to pay uh for  and frequently we don't we don't  realize that  i mean most students for example don't realize a graduate  master's student costs society about eighteen thousand dollars a year  mhh hmm  uh students are paying     cough   well actually a bit less  about sixteen five if the student pays fifteen hundred  then then society picks up sixteen thousand five hundred dollars of of the cost  uh uhm it's it's expensive  mhh hmm  ya   uh i just have a couple more word    but what's society for laugh  exactly     a few words laugh     laugh word this     ya   the only reason we need an economy is so  that people can educate  themselves and uh   right laugh huh   uh huh   mhh hmm   one of the things i want to ask that question about reaching a critical mass in the community and so i was had  in the back of my mind community radio which would be a  certainly a catalyst or unifying factor in   in garnering that uh consent  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   uhm has has radio been used  in that sense   community radio is is    well to bring factions together   uhm uh no  actually i i think of some kind of fogo island model could be very  useful in   in the cree communities but i certainly haven't explored that  or at least initially     mhh hmm   agreement   i've just read about it uh uhm from that   but cough it could be used  right now they're the community radio stations are they're not on air all day  a lot of it is country and western music  and and announcements of political things  that are going on  sure that's right  it's an entertainment word   sure   it's not used as bridge building  no   uh word   word  one of the project i was just involved with in the philippines we went into communities which are very factionalized and uh this  radio by the community uhm really brought groups  together ah into a cohesive force  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   well it it's a it's also ah ah i don't know if i  w i won't call it a problem but there's a tendency for people to respect the elders uh in the in these   so the elders will say one thing in terms of maintaining traditions and the more modern people will then try to bypass the elders and and do something else  develop forestry instead of preserving traplines  and this this creates this creates  the factionalism  instead of opening a dialogue between the two and saying how can we have forestry and traplines together  like how   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i mean can we have selective cutting in a way that respects the word   or or maybe how can we uh milk some of the tourists who have a lot of money instead of forestry maybe have some kind of ah outfitting   cree  outfitting camps where they could make a lot of money and uhm you haven't cut down the forest in the process     uh huh     cough   and if you can keep aids to a minimum  yes  mhh hmm  ya well that's that's a problem too  uhm   well a lot of models in  communities across canada  i know in alberta and british columbia i mean they're doing that   and doing it very well  hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  a few words   and and and community   television too should now  the uhm the uh inuit uh   are have done some  word   word   oh yes the inuit broadcasting corporation  has two words fifteen sixteen years now   mhh hmm mhh hmm     ya     mhh hmm  because presumably if you can get the olders   eld elder elders on television in some kind of debate with some of these   mhh hmm   you say there are three factions the sort of evangelicals the elders and the the business uh types  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  uh it sounds like there could be some very interesting three way discussions if one could ever get these people  mh   oh it would be fascinating  agreement   the thing is that they tend   they don't like to disagree with each other  that's a that's a problem  they they they're not  they're not comfortable with disagreement so they therefore don't mumbled words   so bringing the disagreement out in the open ah as you would have to do to try and resolve it or develop  compromises is very hard to hard to   do   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   well the judgment circles and the healing circles and so on are all part of that 
Canada	 seems to be reaching consensus and   and word a decision  mhh hmm   yes   ya uhm and uhm that's right  there's a also a problem with capitalism  in the north  there's a  problem with capitalism everywhere  laugh   laugh   laugh   laugh it starts at home doesn't it  ya a few words ya  if you make money you stand out   and there there's a tendency there   for for them not to want to be different  oh okay   family connections are much more important than   word   mhh hmm   well you could have the potlatch  when you make money you could give it away to others in the  community   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  mhh  but uh of course that goes a bit against the whole ethos that we have down there   ya  word did it   word   laugh   hmm   that's why i it seems as if the literature that does exist is ext extremely  is dead right that whatever development takes place must be based on existing social structures     mhh hmm   not to superimpose something that's uhh  it's uh seems to be just throwing money away largely  but it doesn't seem as though there's too much prospect of that really happening  uhm well there could be some uhm good business happening if the people who are involved in for example art and crafts if they could start talking to each other and the different communities could trade off send each other their work and then they would have  a a better product line when the few tourists who do show up actually went into the store   well television could help there too actually     mhh hmm mhh hmm   i was just thinking north of sixty canadian television program which i watch religiously a few words    quite active   in fact and then it goes on  yes that's good   mhh hmm ya   agreement   you know i found it quite quite   notable that it wasn't until seventy-one that the the  communities uhh talked to each other uhm ah hadn't  talked much word   but i i gather they weren't really communities until the federal government uh  at least not in the sense that   of of   being villages   exactly   exactly   they were five six families here  the   three or four families over there   hunters and gathers can't afford to live in great bunches of people like that type of thing and that's a ah  absolutely   that's right  mhh hmm  mhh hmm   and and now they have these  these communities in chibougamau is a  population five hundred people and it's one of the most advanced communities in north america     cough   they're total   ya the other word  much too big  yes     uh huh   it's an extraordinary  it has a totally networked computerized uhm system that ties the heating system using wood chips from chibougamau  and uh it's based on a heat transfer system and they've got swedish researchers there in place studying the implementation of this technology  and it's it's highly  advanced     hmm   every single house is networked with every other house  with their uhm heat transfer heating system  it's absolutely fascinating   this community has two telephones   uh uhm   so they can't talk to each other on the community by telephone   uh no i think that the technology is changing and they will have telephones but it's a new community and the system doesn't exist yet   uhm  why not give em them all cellulars laugh   laugh that's right   a few words probably will  word   that'll be useful in the traplines when you're in trouble  word     cough   well are we   i i i don't i i  have read the document in detail from a a  proof-reading standpoint but uhh assuming that somebody has   word   i've gone through it a couple of times  word ya   that's right ya   did you find anything word    word no   responds to a   i went through it once and then two words  word </unclear > was word-checked or spell-checked  go through it     mhh hmm   i didn't notice anything two or three words  no i i went through it very thoroughly again but   yup but i i'm pretty sure  it's it's a word  proofreading comment conversation, directed by z, on the intricacies of the apa style: 2m 15sec   oh ya it may have been offset  that's the older tradition of scholarly uh uhh   partial comment   so it's not it's not it's certainly not   clean a p a american psychological association   well ya  this we can decide   i think maybe what we in this cos this document   uh   agrees   they're only three copies literally  one goes to joan   one goes to robby   and one c comes to me  uh huh   they're kept in the office in the education department  and uh so whatever we decide in this   in this we  have no university ruling on this  agrees   sure   okay okay   ya no i i'm i i   a few words   and if you want to a few words  i'm i think that's fine  no i i think it's quite reasonable  after all it's it's not being   uh   now if this were a thesis and going to the graduate studies then it would have to be  a few words things  mhh hmm   ya mhh hmm   absolutely   word explains reason for question  laugh   yes  no you're right   that word  that that   although it's beginning to get to the point where i think that or it looks like this alm   almost have the status of a thesis  i mean the the the amount of thoughtful writing up and the background i i'm  beginning to wonder whether we really uh  exhale we really need a different world even  a few words mhh hmm   if if uh uhm   well no this probably isn't the place to discuss it but it seems to me an internship the main thing was to was to   do and uh identify crucial situations where you  where you uh learn something unexpected and and  uh situations where you needed to learn things that we hadn't taught you and so on  uh this this internship provides these sorts of things but uhm uhh we do uh we do   require a what seems to be becoming more and more of a thesis document laugh as the time goes on  mhh  that's right   well as you know i work in the university and i   i wanted to to get myself out  of the university right before the word   and that's uh  that's why i chose the option b  yes   ya   uh it was a it was a great uh way it worked out with word   do you have the sheets for us to sign  yes  i think we can uhm  we'll let you have a formal decision  and uh i would like to ask everyone to   leave   mhh hmm   i wonder if tape cuts out   hi diane   hi   isn't it a pleasure to have some decent weather  oh yes ya  i'm dressing like too warm waiting for this kind of weather   i never know what to put on   it's all right   part way through the day it can get really cold and it snowed yesterday laugh   and it could snow i guess  exactly exactly   anyway uh uh i'm glad we could get together because i  i've got picked up my comps yesterday so i'm i'm wanting to get something really new nailed down specifically what i need to do to finish  this paper  okay okay   all right i uhm am sorry to have delayed so much you know   n no  i didn't i didn't pursue you either   laugh   ya it wouldn't have done any good anyway  oh okay laugh   laugh so no guilt trips here   that's clear ya   but i uhm i  laugh read it twice  once when i got it and and again   over last night  okay   you've got some very interesting stuff here and some  ideas that seem to come out  or let's say i was trying to see you come out  of this and uh it seems to me that in several instances i could   mhh hmm mhh hmm   oh that's   one of them you really are   seem to be taken with the idea of language uhm as being  exhale   let's say you're you're you're quizzing whether language is an essential part of cultural identity and you've found a number of references to that  so uh is is that true  ya ya that's uhm well that's partly  ca came it came out   of that article  and i i guess i i'm  thinking you know if a if a community keeps its language they probably keep their culture somewhat more distinct  even though people say language is not an essential component of culture it seems like a really powerful marker or something that  is is strong a stronger marker than  i think only one person said this a stronger marker than a dance or a dress or other distinctive things that make up   a cul culture   distinctive features of a culture   ya   mhh hmm   inhale   so and that that is what i'm i'm thinking of exploring  about five words   and when i read through some of these papers   i don't i don't see that really developed  ya   maybe i haven't found the right book or paper yet  i haven't seen that idea developed really in a balanced way with language and ethnic identity  ya   like how does how much does a person attach themselves to a culture  how much does that how strong is that bond or relationship   between identity and language  ya   mhh hmm mhh hmm   i don't see that really coming  and i don't know those papers  and and that's  i don't know  maybe i need to read baker again  i've been rereading a couple of  chapters so  ya   okay   but you uhm you  did point out some methodo methodological   problems  in some of those papers that said that there was not a strong link between language and  cultural identity   but that's   mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   so i think that's something worth pursuing  mhh  the uhm you you   didn't go into the fishman though which we had talked  about  no   no i didn't  and uhm   what what do you recommend i read to go into that more  is there anything in particular that would  cos i i did check for some books in the library  of fishman's books   ya ya  i have been looking through them  and i just i don't know if  ah it just didn't seem like uh  i found books with the titles that seemed appropriate and yet   i i kinda kind of just didn't   i don't know why i didn't laugh go into fishman but  well uhm i can't say that there's any one  publication uhh that i can think of that would summarize his thought  although certainly that excerpt in baker   okay   uhh why don't you  you had a photocopy of that as i recall   ya ya  and the book's out till until   may or something  well you can borrow mine if you'd like   you word   would that be all right  yes of course   i i'd really like  that because i i i've got enough   isn't it right there   ya i saw it laugh   is it uh this one or this one  ya that one   i don't know but i think it's that one  i think this is the one i have photocopies from  that the part where it's thinking you're thinking of is  decline of languages  word uhm on founded   it was on particularly  well you might even find something else there but i'd think you'd find that it was in uhm   okay not classroom prac   oh wait   you got me in the wrong book   oh this isn't the right book   okay  you're quite right  it must be the other one  oops   here we go   no no   there's something like  it is that other one  ya  do take that too in case there's something but let me look through here because i know  this i used it   okay   language revival and re and reversal    okay it's on page fifty on  here he talks uhh  fishman  lookit canadian interjection demanding attention  they use his nineteen ninety-one book which i'd have to at the back see what it was   a language indexes its culture  a language symbolizes its culture  culture is partly created from its language   which when you think about it makes an awful lot of sense  ya   where do the songs come from   literature   where does the literature come from the stories  the myths  ya   and uhm so there's there's that little bit  and then he talks about it's this graded intergenerational disruption scale about how the whole thing can collapse and uh for threatened languages  mhh hmm   but if you pull out from that if you're not just looking at threatened languages but you look at   in this he he actually goes into detail on the importance of language 
Canada	" mhh hmm  uhm you know he talks about for instance that   that uhm uhh cultures uh immigrants  who are widely dispersed in a new country are apt to lyu   lose their language uhm because of the uhh lack of contact  uh within their group  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and if you follow that through  and that's why i brought in the australian stuff  you will see that uhm they soon lose their language  now you probably don't have these books cos they were published in australia  ohh  and just ignore all that stuff  but michael klein did a lot work on uhm  uhh on this whole question in australia with many languages  language ecology maintenance ah shift ah domains and issues of language maintenance structure of migrant languages   and then of course he was working up to a language policy for australia  ohh   and uh eventually   so he developed it  i don't   no but he worked closely with joe lo bianco and this is actually their uhm the policy   net the commonwealth  you see in australia they have a federal government which  is called the commonwealth and so it's the central government which is located in canberra  ya   then each state has its own provincial uhm legislature  the way we do  however they do have in australia a commonwealth department of education which is used for policy- makin  making for uh education and in this case languages  oh   and i think that if you uh read this you will see a tremendously civilized way of looking at languages and of respecting  uh languages and not feeling that they're going to be a  a tearing apart force in the country  oh  one of the things that is very very important about australia and their policy on languages is they have no official language   oh   oh that's interesting   and they said that they  in fact joe lo bianco told me he said we learn from canada how divisive having official languages can be  and so uh you'll see in here that they respect all languages  they help to promote them  there are some tremendous uhm there's tremendous support for languages in schools  now do you have a copy of my article on uhm  language policy in the antipodes  nope   no  i don't know if i can't put my hand on it right away  that would be nice   it's well it's in a journal in the library  i'll be able to find it there  ya  uh do  it's ahh  is it called language policy in   i i think eh i know it's got  antipodes in it  language policy in the antipodes  language policy down under something like that  uhm and it's in that one was in the c a a l  you know the canadian association of applied linguistics   journal  okay   mhh hmm  and it's quite old now  uhm it's probably about eighty-seven but  i'm not positive on that  mhh hmm   but i do have  if you're going to be around the university i'll just make a note and uhh i know i have copies of it at home that i can put my hand on immediately  that might be easier  it's really hard to get on the c d rom in the library at this time  they're booked like  the the one that's uh you know the one that   has the the journals i need is always booked cos it's ah it's joined with some  arts   kind of index as well   ya   ya   i'll about three words  no problem   so if i could come pick that up maybe tomorrow or  yes  now where do you live  i live uhm just in between saint-laurent and saint-denis uh close to duluth right in the plateau sort of area  okay   okay okay   they're very close to like the  uh sherbrooke metro  ya   all right because i'm at the v&ecircumflex;ndome metro  oh you live near hannah   yes  ya  and i'm right in in westmount  and if you uhm   tomorrow i've got to go and see a student uh somewhere  uh i can't remember where laugh   laugh i'm not surprised  laugh   saint-urbain and laugh you know   wait a minute saint-urbain and   ya and uh bernard   and uh that's where i get the bus   bernard  where is bernard  it's farther north  it's farther north  oh ya ya i think i know where that is   all right   that's quite far from where i am but uh  saint-urbain's close  yes uhm   but where are  ah if you're going to be in i could almost drop it off in your box on on in your mail  like is it an apartment or is it even possible  oh   ya i'm just thinking that's uh  is it on your way  would you be taking saint-denis   i have to go downtown afterwards  ya   like if you take saint-laurent uhm  mhh hmm   i can't take saint-laurent down cos it's a one-way up  oh you're going  i'm going to be up at bernard you see   oh you're coming back that way  you're going to drop it off on your way back to town   yes   uhm you could take saint-denis and then you go to rue french pronounciation of this as: "" ju"" or [ zh]  r o y   to go turn right and you go about three or four blocks to the street i live on  mhh hmm   ya   it's called saint-hubert s t   oh yes i know that  and uh you go then you have to go   right  you have to go back to go north on it because it's a one-way street  and the address is thirty forty rue   saint-hubert number one number one  all right   okay  uh any idea what time that would be   uh no  i could phone you tonight and tell you  that would help because i like to get to the library  i don't work well at home  yes   i just fiddle around and have coffee  word   well it it'll certainly  it won't be until eleven thirty or something  well i can wait well   eleven thirty  but you see i'm sure i'm going to see this woman  at nine thirty so  it'll be   that's okay   oh that's okay   eleven thirty's fine  is it  ya ya  i was just thinking if it's later in the afternoon  i'll i know what'll happen to me  no no no   it's my own it's my own fault you know not being disciplined enough to work at home but  i know i just i  get here it's like going to my job  ya   mhh hmm   laugh you know i i go to that  library and things occur to me  yes yes   and i think i'm just so used to working there that's where  my thinking kicks in laugh   and no derac no distractions as well   no i'd really like to read that  and so i could use things  ah there's things in there about language and i   and ethnic identity   it talks about uhm uh australia and new zealand and england  mhh  and but it it   it looks more at the at  psychological or sociological reasons for language policies and what actually happens in education  but i think you'll you an underlying context   is certainly uhm respect for ethnic identity or non-respect for  so uh ya  ya  now how do you want how do you think you want to develop this  well i took a stab at it because i thought   i've got i've been doing this reading and i needed to  good   i'm glad you asked me to do the annotated bibliography because i found it much easier to remember what i'd read which goes back to february doesn't it  that's right  and i found that i could rea   really i could really i had sort of a global view of uh i mean sort of a main idea global  picture of what was in the article  so that was a really good thing to do  mhh   mhh hmm   often you know i'm reading a lot of articles  and i forget   i've had many students say that ya   ya   so just maybe three words    they say annotated bibliography i  hated doing it  but it was really useful   ya   oh i didn't  i i didn't hate doing it  and it's it's good forever you know  you you'll be able to tackle  ya   so you've actually written something up for me  super   ya you know and i've related   like i've this is just this can be completely changed uhm but i  what i i avoided i guess in a way  uhm you know the factors and variables that uh are listed  it's not in this book  it's in the other one i think   mhh hmm   the uhm the things that are grouped  i just fou found   i found that was that there were too many variables and factors for me to to deal with  i i just it it's it's a  like it's good but when i was writing my paper i just thought i was going to get into this uh whole analysis of what leads to loss and what leads to maintenance again  mhh hmm   and i wanted to look at it differently  i wanted to look at language and identity and  what what is what is that all about  okay   so uhm anyway  this is what i did  so if i word to   all right   so what tell me what   path you've taken   okay so uhm anyway i just   i don't know  you might wanna want to just read that over uhm  eh i'm not happy with it  it's not it's definitely  something i want to change  mhh hmm   but what i wanted to look at first in the first section was what is the le word   language express  and there's one article i read by romaine i think from the  fish's point of view where she she   goes into that  mhh hmm   and edwards he critiques some people's views because he says well they're members of a minority group so they have a biased point of view  they're not subjective  oh yes   and now it's time that we have a more  objective point of view  yes   and uh so i wanted to kind of look at that issue like uhm  what is it that expresses that   the inside outside   ya the unique point of view uhm and a different experience from the minority and the majority  mhh   so that was what i dealt with in one section  okay  and i haven't put romaine's in here yet  i i'm just sort of going through that article on again on a second or third time  mhh hmm   then i thought you know like for minority uhm you know we think we're con we're giving this   kind of concessionary policy  mhh   that came out of one of the articles too  say we're well we'll let you keep your language kind of kind of   yes yes   that's the perspective of the majority  but for a minority uh i just learned this this year that bilingualism is not necessarily something that's going to guarantee that they keep their language and culture because it's like this intermediary step  between uhm keeping it and  and   being in completely assim assim  assimilation ya   mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm mhh hmm   right maintenance or transitional into the other into assimilation   so i wanted to discuss those concepts and diglossia   because it was mentioned by fishman i think that   he goes that diglossia without bilingualism  provides a stable enduring language arrangment and i thought  that's not true for minorities and it's criticized by someone else as well  in here   yes   so uh bilingualism a bit diglossia a bit and the  and then i into this concept of multiculturalism or   pluralism   ya   ya   i don't know   it seems too many things laugh   but i i i think you've you one of the things that's very important though to do is to give some definitions to your terminology   because i'm sure as you read through  the literature you saw that people are not always using the same  with the same meanings  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  now what does hinton mean about  diglossia and bilingualism   i went to baker for   i mean what's your definition of diglossia  oh so you'd like me to put in there what he's meaning by  diglossia as opposed to what baker  mhh "
Canada	" but i like the idea of what i've been doing with the objects and just giving them a kinda kind of kitschy feel to them you know and stuff like that  like with the driftwood with this i think i'm gonna  going to do probably two more and then i  think i'll move on to the cheese or  mm hmm   cos i've been uh i've been like i was   just at a restaurant monday night i went to uh baum gartners and mal mala molio's or malvolio's   uh casa di pasta name of a restaurant, pronounced incorrectly  on crescent there   mm hmm   they just opened it up  but i just saw they they're trying to be so chic and this place and everything and  aside don't go the food is terrible laugh   laugh   but they had a really interesting thing  they took the rind pronounced like "" rhine"" or whatever of a big cheese like they gutted it out  and they just put all the parmesan in it  mm hmm   mm hmm oh that's word   so it was just this big giant thing of parmesan and this huge cheese thing and uh one of the girls i was with said oh you know you should use that as an idea you know like ooh cheese and cheese you know and stuff like that and i thought hmm yeah  so i've been tryin trying to come up with ideas for like making those cheese drawings you know   mm hmm   like putting some content into that just instead of just drawing like cheese cheese cheese cheese cheese  mm hmm   yeah i noticed there's a lecture coming up on uhm kitchen modernism and the relationship  mm hmm  it's just out on the uh on the  bulletin board out there  okay  and in uh the uh recent art in america magazine title  that i just got i thought you'd be interested in viola frey  okay   you must know viola frey's work  she does those huge ceramic figures uh with like they have little squares marked on them they're sort of divided up into fragments and they have sort of landscapes yeah and then scenes on them   oh i think i've yeah i think i've   seen some of her work   and she has uhm you know she does   these uh drawings on plates and i was thinking about you uhhhm  and i noticed that in her titles like she sort of gives some clue as to you know what she's thinking about in a particular image uhm  this one's called skeleton and horse and questioning woman  uhm   and then uh this one here you know red buddha   but the ceramic technique you know the painting on the plates   mm hmm   using the uh you know that  technique where the you know plate is very smooth and the the the  the medium is very liquid-like  mm hmm  word a lot of brush work and so the surface becomes very interesting   mm hmm   and very like it's very free and gestural and liquid so  that's the other thing i've been always like which you've pointed out with me is uh i've been tryin  trying to get more gestural in my work more expressionistic in a sense uh cos i think that's an aspect that loud noise in the background - maybe a stapler - twice i've sort of yeah kind of tightened myself up so much that i was always tryin  trying to be so perfect and conservative that now i think i'm enjoying more of the   well i was thinking of the values and the philosophy that's embodied in a look in the work  mm hmm   and so you know if i look at this kind of work you know it has uhm you know popular images art images like there's all kinds of sources  that appear in the work   right right mm hmm   and i guess that what i hear you saying is that you're looking for sources you know like memories other resources you know like right now   well i wen yeah but word   yeah  i do a lot of research too when i'm getting into stuff like this like the horror one i went through like horror movies and just flipping through images that i thought were kind of eerie and interesting and stuff like that  and i just uh i think it helps me a lot when i am coming to ideas because i always get stuck at certain points and then i just think oh it's you know go to the library and spend a couple hours goin going  through some books and you know something might click  and i was thinking that right now uhm as i've been looking at your work there's a formal issue that you're concerned with in the content  mm hmm   mm hmm  you know the sort of uhm word are evolving in the work  mm hmm   and i was looking at these and for example this one quite interested me  it's called monsters monster self looking in window uhm and the handprints you know that are incorporated and it's very speedy quick   yeah yeah  kind of an you know image  i'm not uh suggesting that you work that way or anything  yawning from speaker b in the background but i'm just uhm saying how   the pla techn the technique of painting on the plate   mm hmm  and the imagery usually one doesn't associate it   associate that with a decorative uh   the tradition of decorating plates   yeah completely right   that's a very uhm expressionistic look as well  as uhm s an awareness of uh notions of identity that come through in the images you know  so you know you get the uh   the handprints  the handprints on the side uh the notion of the idea that you know there's not just one self but of a monster self  mm hmm  you know that and the idea of the window you know the idea of painting being a kind of window that you look at the portrait and you know like actually drawing the window  yeah   so it's actually a very informed image in terms of you know the ideas behind it  hmm   like it may've happened intuitively in a flash  snaps fingers but it may have come out of uhm a certain awareness and uhm   again this one is uh called monster break-up chaos  and i just thought of you a lot because she uses these very you know sort of popular culture sources of things   yeah yeah yeah yeah i can see that  and it depends a lot on the intensity of the surface and the movement so she had to make it quite interesting   well she's very   i think it's very expressionistic  yeah  and very movement and   so when i look at the uh image of the owl okay uhm  what would make me think in your drawing that it's a memory   what clue visually have you given me to make me know it's a memory   and i would make that a a problem for you in your next work  right  like since these works are about evoking memory  right  uh how can you evoke like visually the idea that this is a memory  like how would i know it's not uhm you know uh something that you've seen that you reproduced  right right  do you know what i mean  okay  in other words how do i know it's a reference and not  something you're uhm   paying homage to in a sense  yeah that's it  okay okay  so it's difficult to uh get that sense of uh  what it's about  see that's right   you know and if i look at this guy's work here in this uhm artist uhm jacob lawrence  mm hmm  you know they're like pla paintings  that tell of the black exodus you know the migrations from the south to the north in the united states  and you know like the way he framed it okay the size each one's the same size  they're twelve by eighteen inches you know  mm hmm  so they have the size tells you like it's modest it's not supposed to knock you over  mm hmm  it's a very modest size  and then the text tells us  like one thing that you know it's not just a painting of buildings  right  is you know he informs us  uhm here it is uhm   reads some text aloud   mm hmm  so like the colours right away like they're not they're they're could be "" there's"" certain kind of colours  the painting has a certain illumination  mm hmm  it's simplified uhm it's modest in appearance  it's not it isn't given a look of slickness and uh it's given a certain look that's fixed in his philosophy  yeah   mm hmm  you know about uhm som there's something humble and touching about it  and then in an awkward like uhm very schematic look uh so that it's easily understood but also like it's very touching you know and it promotes certain values  so just through the look you get an idea of what the artist's values are  and that's what i'm questioning you  i think i'm yeah i can see what you're   it was uhm where   you know if i look at viola frey i get i get  an idea from the look of those marks  yeah   right  where she's at and the you know and her   values around artmaking  mm hmm  and i like found it interesting to look at these two artists because they're both aligning themselves with values visually  the values are being expressed in a visual way that are almost uhm anti-establishment this  yeah  just without actually saying it i mean in this case he's obviously you know accounting the history of the black exodus  mm hmm  but in the style like he's referring another aesthetic   you know   exactly   that comes from uh first of all the notion of story telling or telling the history of the didactic where like all this is very uhm contrary to  you know he's painting at the same time as jackson pollock i mean it was the antithesis of internationalist abstraction and so  and very consciously so  and yet he also uses you know sort of cartoon-like well not cartoon but very schematic kinds of images  and yet the compositions are very beautiful and really thought out uh you know like the choice of this yellow over here and just you know this very sombre unpretentious kind of mark is very important   and here as well oh here's one that says reads text aloud   so you know he's using this uhm  did these quotes come with the paintings then  yeah the quotes come with the paintings  so alright   uh they're placed next to them  but his compositions are really incredible you know like the little bits of colour and  yeah  the the you know you're in the presence of something that's the common people  mm hmm  and you get that not just cos the subject matter but through the way he lays paint down the way you know the uh flat cut-out approach you know he's aligning himself with a certain cultural identity and you know painting them in this way  the allocations and stuff like that yeah   so that's why i'm thinking about   since they're about memory and you're trying to recall certain nostalgia it sounds like what you're describing  mm hmm   now how could you start to uh communicate that aspect a bit more  yeah   perhaps uhm maybe you could disrupt some of the information you know like the words   right that's what i've been   yeah that's another thing i was thinking of doing  you know like letting things be fragmented a bit more because like memory one of the things that characterizes memory is that it's not exactly like something happening in the moment  yeah it's always blocks and pieces and trying to put it together  yeah and so formally like you've given me everything is in equal detail  so that doesn't make me feel very much like it's memory  yeah   mm hmm  uhm and there's nothing in the text to tell me that it's memory  mm hmm  i mean that's more factual than the text  so i think formally you know that's something to consider   well and in a sense in a sense like there is the nostalgia feel with like empty words like hypnovision and the mystic terror of the owl or whatever  well this   uh huh "
Canada	" ya  cos i took this out of the the baker book so uh ya okay  right   i see mumbles under her breath   definition   okay   uhm and then uh this whole idea of multicultural policy and uh  like multilingualism being encouraged but   you know the perception being you know that some are  generally supportive but there're problems with the from the point of view of the immigrant uh people  mhh hmm   ahh   some people feel that it's been used to keep them in their place and create a vertical mosaic uhm others uh you know it's been kind of just another ina for and in that way a kind of a segregation word and uhm  mumbles   and it's also kind of politically motivated  and in a way it reinforces the power structures that   that are already in place  because on one one article i read they were saying that you know  oh was it ab about   it was about australia actually  that if minority groups uh attempt to make any change in that structure it's not perceived  no it wasn't about australia  it was about canada  it was about if the minority population makes some attempt to  take some initiative in changing the structures or suggestions for how they would like to have their language maintained it's not always viewed positively by the government  the example was quebec with bill one oh one  quebec law affirming french as the official language and it was seen   as very as as a threat  mh hmm   mhh hmm  i think  i forget which article that's in but  uhm that was  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   so i was looking at the minority's perspective on uh  ya i think that was edwards  i mean he went on great length about that  ya he did   i mean that was an eighty page article   and romaine agreed with it  and romaine agreed with him she said  hmm  i think  it's probably in in the summary there that i was looking at yesterday  no   mumbling it's a symb   symbolic   it's two or three words   what happens is there's a sym  symbolic form  of ethnicity and uh that you know people are comfortable with it at a symbolic or kind of as a concept but something that uh alters reality  was a statement that came into it as  something that people are not comfortable with so  ya well   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh   but you're heading right into a political discussion   here power discussion  mhh hmm   do you want to go into that  well the next section  okay  you might want to just read this over but the next section  after that i go into that was on political  socio-political and educational   context and uhm uhh ya that then  you know that that this idea of ah language being a banner for as an ethnic identity  mhh hmm   right   i mean this is this is our banner  this is our symbol of our ethnic identity and then using that   for political as a s s  in the political arena   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   but i don't know ma   may wha i don't know i think i may have covered too many things and i should probably do some   of redo some of this   ya cos it's not a thesis   okay i was just wondering on how many pages would be appropriate approximately for for this paper  but i think i covered like lots of things maybe not as deeply as i need to  it's word   i just kind of like feel like that but  exhale   ya ya   students always want to know how many pages  well i know seven's not enough laugh   i always say laugh   i always say as long as it needs to develop your ideas but uhm  i think you ought to be able to do something in twenty to twenty-five pages don't you  mhh hmm   i think that that   and when when would this need to be in by so that i don't get an i p can mean "" in progress""   i need to graduate this semester laugh   you do  cos i'm going back to b c british columbia   ya   okay   i haven't got we haven't got the grade sheets in yet  so you don't know   and so you'll be a graduating one  uhm so i yes i don't know  okay  uhm how how are you fixed for time  well uh i'm not going  i'm not   are you going to devote yourself to this  at the moment   ya   i'm i've just picked out the comps  comprehensive exams on tuesday and they do april  thirtieth   are you going to be able to work on this as well as the comps  laugh i'm gonna going to  have to  mhh hmm   what uhm   i could find out  you haven't spoken to rick about deadlines for getting all the grades in or anything but if you've got until the thirtieth of april for your comps by the time people read them and get in their grades i imagine we're talking the fifteenth of may aren't we  ya   that sounds sounds reasonable  it looks to me laugh it'd be two weeks  ya   ya ya  it's ah ya it is a question i have as to how i'm gonna going to do both  but i have this paper  i have something to finish up for the supervision course that i was doing with booker   and that's not very much   that's not very much at all i don't think   okay   i mean i've been working on it  i was reviewing articles and i've been working on that   for that last  month or so and getting diary entries as i was visiting students with diana and that  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so it's a matter of pulling it together   so  so that's not going to take me more than  well i i say a day so it'll probably be like two or three laugh you know but  mhh hmm   so there's this and the comps and uh  mhh hmm   these things always take more time  especially the fiddly things at the end   ya   i would appreciate it if like the deadline wasn't the same day  as and at the same time as the comps  if i could have an extra week   that would really help me  just because you know i'll be  wor working like i like to kind of do two things at once  anyway   two or three words oh no    sure   of course of course   mhh hmm   it's all right to   mhh hmm  but uhm   switch back and forth  and and i've done   mo most a lot of reading for this already  ya   it's not like the comps so   yes like that you've done a lot of  yes  and are your comps i i is  it going to touch on anything like this  no   laugh no i've sort of got a smattering of every  laugh bit of applied linguistics going i think  laugh it's all right laugh ahh  i had two words   laugh with word me    i really i really uh  uh  some a few words   i i don't know   what do you think  do you think that it's uh it's going to be uhm possible to do both  i mean i   oh sure  of course it is  i think so  i i know i'm going to be busy but   i think that word   graduate students when they're about to graduate can  work miracles so not a problem  laugh oh gosh   uhm  but i don't mind  you know like i was thinking if it was even due the first week of may i if that's not too late to get the marks in uhm   well i will find out about that  ya   but the beginning of may looks very good for me  i will what i will say to you is that as soon as i get it i will act on it immediately and that's  why i was looking at my book  ya   i don't want it before the sixth   okay well that's kind of the sixth looks good   and uh because then i  cos i've got all day meetings on the thursday and friday so i really can't touch it then  awright all right so you can't touch it then   and uh if i have it on the sixth i'll do it right away  the only problem will be if i can't get an extension  for uhm i if your mark is due  in   that's ya   but i don't think it is  you know i really don't think  i think they're probably not going to be after us until  if   well i was wondering  you know i don't know if i can change my mind about the comps but you know in one way this is far more important to me  i've been last semester i had really good marks  this is a topic that i i'm really   interested in  ya   i don't want to just you know  you know exhale i don't want to just hand you a paper   that's   mhh hmm   you know what i'm saying  i want to work on it work through it and   ya and you want to get something out of it  ya ya   ya ya i think that's   and i want to be sure i i i  gave it the effort and time that i  that i can give  not where i'm just sorta sort of   saying well here i'm done here's my last paper boom i'm   outta out of here  mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm   okay   i i don't i don't  feel good about that  it hasn't served me well in the past   let me   i'll check with that   so i would appreciate that  but i i am like i i i  know that uhm i i want to get things wrapped up this semester because it it just i i'd just  like to be finished you know   well you're right at the end so   it's it's been two years for me  i you know i started  yes   that's a long time  so i word   sure   but if it has to be different then definitely then   it has to be done differently   ya ya   okay well  no i think that uh we can certainly work that out end of tape   so i would like to discuss now what seems to be  happening uh with respect to uhm the childhood uhm or the nursery problem  and what's funny is is uhm as of yet two words not caught up there's na   no mention yet of this in in  the english papers  but what we see happening now is cough uh basically duplessis is starting to try to wrestle the power away from the federal government   mhh  okay  there's this whole thing that starts up about uhm family allocations and uh basically somebody you know says that the federal government uh what is it uhm the laws by the federal government are unconstitutional   here we are  monsieur choquette by the way j&eacute;r&ocircumflex;me choquette  remember him  oh yes   i wonder if he was related  uh said this law is unconstitutional and has to be replaced and basically what we have is the union nationale led by maurice duplessis taking away power over the family uh from the federal government and that's where you can see what's going to happen  mhh   because uh it starts off as kind of a shouting match between uh duplessis and king who was prime minister at the time  over who has the rights over the family  mhh hmm   uh which is finally uh mister king  apologizes and basically gives the power over to the quebec government  who immediately uh attempt to create uhm  oh what was it called  uh uhh kind of ah ah  here it is  an inscription of child families  they basically want to start a list of families  a list   and they they've  basically got their own ideas about how they're gonna going to run families and uh daycare nurseries have nothing to do with it  mhh hmm   uh they are very profoundly pro-catholic  and uh anti-federalist anti-interference  mhh hmm   uhm so we're definitely gonna going to   laugh be headed away from the daycares   yes   so it doesn't surprise me that by october of forty-five   it closed   mhh hmm   what's the point of the list of having a list  it just seems to be kind of ah a combination census   and and kind of a list of who who  should we allocate these funds to who's gonna  going to get this money  mhh hmm "
Canada	 we're talking about family allowances basically   mhh hmm   uh if when you read through the this  article this very rather lengthy article   uhm where is it  here   and the thing is uh uh the debate starts about aid to the families  and it's quite a long article  mhh hmm   i'm focused in on the really good stuff here   all right  good   and uh so they they're planning to revamp the entire system the entire social system  mhh hmm  and they want the federal government ment  out of it  as i said there there's this great debate that leads to that and they finally kick them out basically   uh in no uncertain terms and they're gonna going to change everything  mhh hmm   they wanna want to change everything  mhh hmm  because there was there were  developments at the federal level in terms of uhm thinking about a   minimum minimum income and revamping the whole social wel welfare  system which did come after the war  mhh hmm   so this seems to be in anticipation of that and   wanting to have some provincial uhm wa  want wanting to que quebec  to have its own provincial system in place ahead of that  that's right  emphasizing well that's what   songman found earlier on which the french basically ignored which was the federal government attempting to revamp the system  mhh   mhh hmm  and uh they seemed to ignore it up until the point where they just basically say the changes are unconstitutional and they want them out and they want the new uhm new  family allocations with uh little interf   interference little or no interference from the federal government  mhh   mhh  so that's what's going to lead to this  mhh hmm   and this is all taking place feb february    this is february forty- five ya   forty-five ya  february's a pretty pretty hot month for a few issues  okay  uh the next of which  remember i t talked with you previously about uh the fact that uhm the that they the   mayor of montreal has been arrested uh for   tra traitor being a trea  treason   treasonist behaviour cos he basically incited people not to conscript  mhh hmm mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  there's no mention for the longest time and all a sudden here in february forty-five not only do we hear about the mayor being released   you mean he was imprisoned all that time   he was imprisoned all that time  yes he was  uhm   who was the mayor of montreal while  he's   i'm not quite sure  i haven't been able to ascertain that from the articles whether there was like ah  interesting   was there ah you know a a   provisional mayor  was because they talk about him  when he's released they talk about him as the mayor   yes  he did not seem to lose his position  i'm not quite clear  it's very h   so he participated or he did he  incite the riots  he didn't incite a riot  he just told basically in a public speech said  that children of of quebec meaning men age conscription age men  should refuse to to   uhm to sign up basically  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and that was seen some treason or   treason   ya  hmm   and what's funny is it happened so long like i said it was like silent  i knew that it was just a historical fact and i said to myself what happened why it   yes   and suddenly in february forty-five something clicks and all of a sudden it starts  remember i said the debate on conscription hasn't been mentioned for the four years we've been covering from forty-two to  so probably previous to that there was some sort of clamp down  all a sudden it starts again the debate on conscription starts again   there must have been a ban on in the press  on on uh debating conscription  ya   ya probably using uh the war measures act  mhh   uhm you know kind of saying okay we uh   the debate continues   and then there are one two three four various views  under the names of different people here  mhh hmm   now who wha what was that mayor's name michel   camillien houde  oh of course   cos the street's named after him huh   yes   uhm okay   so that's that's a big thing now that  he's he's suddenly gotten out of ja jail gotten himself out of jail and all of a sudden they're talking about the conscription issue again  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  uh i guess with the war winding down people are feeling more confident  and i don't know if they actually let off the   the laws  it's very unclear  they just kind of say that the mayor's out  mhh hmm  uh doesn't mention him there  being any apologies made on any side  mhh hmm   but he's now out and he seems to still be the mayor and and uh   mhh hmm   his term you would think is would have  expired as soon as word in jail   ya i mean he's in jail   ya   but i guess elections were suspended or whatever    ya now this very interesting  this starts uhh in february and in earnest   uh and it's a full page ad  it's ver very  actually hard to copy into our ad cos it's so huge  mhh hmm  it's this thing called a federation of charity  mhh hmm   and this is sort of the first ad that comes up and it's about this guy uhm uhm this honourable maurice trudeau   uh who said that he saw you know poverty and families abandon children  mhh hmm   uh you know uh people being uh uhm uh  you know he saw all these horrible things chi  children poor children   in in things abandonment  mhh hmm   and and uh you know nurseries uh i saw uh poor babies you know sick and and all these terrible things  and what he keeps promising  i saw bad schooling and everything and   and all these different things  mhh hmm   and what he's promising is that he's going to   this federation is going to put money towards fixing these things  they have pictures here  mhh   uhm i think there's a better shot of the pictures where  you see poor children being fed you know kind of like uh babies and mass  two words   mhh hmm   ya soup kitchen two words   ya   so this guy is claiming that he's going to uhm uh uhh help  and you can help  and this is  they want  but but laugh but we need this much money okay   oh ya  and uh  this is uhh this is not associated with the catholic church  no no  this is  i i'm not quite sure what this guy is  quaker   ah here we have now he's actually this   is comes like the next day  we have a breakdown of the costs and the things  that that they need the money for  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   he's explaining what all this money is going to be used for  mhh hmm   aid to the families uh medical to home placement of children which sort of uhm relevant to our uh study uh special diets uh development of existing things uhm uh you know all kinds of social services  mhh hmm   basically it's almost like uh we don't need the federal government  mhh hmm   we're going to create our own secular system cos it's definitely not with the church  mhh hmm   uhm we have here the members of the committee of this  budget   mhh hmm   so we have the names here  mhh hmm  but it's it's basically  charity for canadian french canadians   yes   it's like they're saying we're going to create our own social system  secular privatized  social system   mhh hmm   yes   mhh hmm   that's important because up to now there's been a protestant  english - language system for charity and there's been a  a catholic church run system and so this is really uh  quite remarkable   and it just goes on   i mean this is then then   a couple days later you get this one which is actually the picture word from that  this is the picture which i thought is just so  oh my goodness that hand   i look at that   look at it  isn't it horrible laugh   a few words   hand of poverty and   and destitution   and dark  coming  out of the darkness   don't you find in this   it's it's the  french  it's french canadian   you won't find it in the english papers  no they don't talk about it  mhh   so we've come up with this  this alternate uh social system and it's the french taking care of the french  mhh hmm   and they you know really acting like they are a nation within a nation   by themselves is the main thing   ya   you talk about totally different stuff    ya   i have no clue what laugh you're talking  about because they don't talk about  it in the english   that's right   mhh hmm mhh hmm  these are french canadians saying we've got to take care of our own and we're gonna going to   you know and we need your money   no   and it's funny cos when you follow it   they do they never do get all the money that they needed  they   well it's going to it's going to as it sounds like they had some grand schemes but did  did any of it come to pass   it peters out  there's just nothing  uh that's forty   uh when was that  uh february   uhm   and uh there's dates on some of them  uhm  yes february forty-five  okay  what ends up happening is is it just sort of peters out  it doesn't seem to pan out  mhh hmm   they just k   k kind of the ads get smaller and smaller as the amount  now by laugh the second week they're down to things like this   ah   and uh i'm not quite sure what happens to these people  mhh hmm  it just kind of stops mentioning them  mhh hmm  but really a a big focus on children  throughout the campaign  it seems   yup   yup   so they have like an alternative system that again it's just like they are in total contempt of the federal system  they're just trying to a act  as if it's not happening  mhh hmm  this this sounds like you know there is no social system in in service that there's no social services in in place and they're going to create them as if the federal one isn't even in exi existence   mhh hmm   it's just kind of like   ignored   mhh hmm   or other private ones  ya  here this this is interesting  this is uh uhm a bit more about uhm educating parents  and uh you know it's it's   back to this whole idea of ah  oh yes   it's not actual reference to the uh parents' school which   we get at saint henry which we've seen before  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  this seems to be references to uh just generally we have to take care of our children and it's our responsibility  ah so again sort of ah discounting the role of   of the federal government and their importance  mhh hmm   and it like it's our problem and uh   mhh hmm  and is this the church saying this   no   uhm the the   abb&eacute;   oh yes  mhh  mhh hmm  okay  okay now remember the tramway problem  remember the asking for scab labour  yes   well it's really funny because   the funny thing is that shortly after that little thing they're talking about the strike and then they're talki  talking and then they have that ads in the classified for women   to work them and uh you don't hear anything about it for months and months and months and then all of a sudden laugh  first comes this one  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i love this this one   laugh   two problems in montreal prostitution and the trams   laugh   laugh some people would still agree   how can you compare the two   laugh   laugh so that's seen as a   laugh a new issue  let's have some air   uhm   prostitutes prostitution  and trams now what what's the problem with the trams  is it still the strike   it's still the strike  it's still the strike   they've been on strike now for several years  it seems locked out  a long time ya 
Canada	 ya  and uh they start mentioning it every once in a while  you'll see uh basically it's usually whenever there's an accident with the trams suddenly this becomes this uhh uh really big issue  mhh hmm   uh every time we have an accident   oh really because they've got untrained drivers or   exactly exactly  and it's all their fault  and here we have   what what about  prostitution though  what are they blaming that on   oh well that was a big issue eh in the forties  i mean it actual would fact  it it lead to the the rise of  mayor drapeau because he was the lawyer  mhh hmm   remember he's a young lawyer  i told you  he's saving that fifteen-year-old who's  going to be executed for a murder   yes   mhh hmm   uh he ends up uh taking this as kind of like ah ah  single-handedly he becomes a crusader  he closes down all the prostitute  there was a lot of there was a red light district  with a lot of of basic houses of prostitution and this was seen as a big issue  mhh hmm   there's actually a series in french   they had a running series  what was it called  op open  montreal open city   i think it was an eight ser   series mini-series and it's drama based on this whole  problem of prostitution and  and   drama   oh yes   in the thirties  the thirties and forties  hmm  and actually i think it was more in the forties  cos in the thirties he's very young  hmm   so he made his name basically closing down the red light district  hmm  ah very famous  but it was like it was a business  it was a very lucrative business   mhh hmm   and it was like you know i mean it's a lot of poverty so it  was seemed as a a  viable option for young women  you know in this in this   situation   hmm   mhh hmm   nothing to do with dis   disintegration of the family though   no   i've never read anything about prostitution  oh ya   although i'm not far up where you are  but   well the protestants just seem to   english protestants just seem to ignore the whole situation   cos it's not   it's not even an issue in any of this  ya   mhh  they may be using prostitutes but  they're certainly not ya prostitutes  themselves   mhh   i've never seen any headlines   mhh   it's a ba basically a french canadian phenomena  mhh  and it goes back to the prohibition era actually where  montreal was still wet where the rest of canada was dry  and so and the united states so everybody would come to montreal  yes   mhh hmm   and it was called sin city  mhh hmm   it was known as sin city  and so prostitution flourished because you had this uh underground culture  mhh hmm  i mean with fifty percent unemployment in the depression   you know it was like an option  mhh hmm   i mean you could be a prostitute   mhh hmm   you could make money and  and it still has a reputation of being a a  uh city where there's there's no closing hour and it's a got a wild side to it in terms of its reputation as opposed to what it  really laugh really  is   that's right   ya laugh yes   ya   ya and this is uh of course typically we have two  important articles  ya   here's the affair of the tramway  they are arguing about the brotherhood of the thing or are  going to have this big conference  oh yes   and so it's still an issue you know here on the  what is it the sixteenth of february nineteen  forty-five   mhh hmm   so it's been like a year as far as i can tell   mhh hmm   and uh here we have uhm it's just a picture without any article uhm uhm about this fire this horrible fire that happened in maine bangor  maine   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   is it bangor  yes bangor   yardbourne yup  there's been this huge fire and sixteen children were killed  so we have several reports of this  oh my goodness   ya and it's really kind of fuel for the anti-   garderies quebec french: daycare centre eh cos  here's a garderie burnt down  institutions   sixteen kids inside   you mean this was a garderie   mhh hmm ya   oh my goodness   word this  here's here's   now the next day cos i guess that was a last minute thing and they just kind of stuck that picture in  here's the next day front page   oh my   so now they've got like some real fuel   this is the same   ya it's the same thing  that's just a picture that appears one time and the next day we have this this uh real follow-up on it  so i get the feeling the fire happened  they weren't quick enough to be able to write a story  about it but put in the picture in anyways  yes   am i correct in thinking that this   originally you were referring to maine  so this is in montreal   ya that's ri right    no no no  the fire is not in montreal  that's what i thought at first but if you read the article  it's in maine  okay   so here was no   we don't have any article going along with this  no but it does say a fire in a  garderie   and they're referring to garderie   word word   burn  ya   and ya uh i that was my initial thing  oh this is   and in french   french names   yes  i thought oh this is this is in montreal  and then the next day when you read this article then you start to realize uhm   oh all right   maine  ya  auburn  auburn sorry  i thought it was bangor   okay i was looking over here but this is another fire  in a convent   no this is another fire in montreal ya  it's actually it's a convent which was on laval chaterre uhm which was like a historical site  mhh  but ya it doesn't really  it it ya initially you think oh ya they're connected  it's not   incredible  okay well that would make anyone think twice about  daycare if uhm   putting their kid   we have seventeen actually who died  one must have died during the night  ya  it was like real   from three months to six years   huh   terrible  i've never heard about that fire   ya i know   it it was a big thing  i'm interested to see what brenna comes when she gets to that date  uh here we have in the latest january nineteen forty-five  uh still great demand for women in war  and d i love this  women young women less than sixty years of age please apply   hmm   i think no wonder they had to create   why aren't they in school   ya no kidding huh  so these are at working for the tobacco  ya imperial tobacco which is still there  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   but i just thought that was really striking  i mean no wonder they needed social reform because i mean you know they're asking in the paper   for you to drop out of school   mhh hmm   they got down to fifteen year old girls  now   ya   they exhausted all the other potential employees  ya   ya  that's interesting  okay here's the uh more tramway on the tramway debate   and these come up you know sort of  sporadically  mhh hmm   there's interest and then they seem to forget about it  at times you think the strike's over because you haven't heard of it so long and then suddenly you'll hear ah  mhh hmm mhh hmm   is there anything about the strike in the english press  brenna   i i actually did come across one didn't i michel   ya  the tramway   now i can't remember wh   where   ya  in the downtown   we were looking at it weren't we  ya  do you remember what article  mhh  it was in word   no it was just it was on   it was funny because it wasn't for that you had gotten it  did i throw it away   no i did  did i did i did i throw it away  no you kept it  it's still there somewhere  no but   here it is   no   ya  strike sidelines   irate tram users displayed row use broken windows as entrance   that's terrible  mhh  so the the strike is still going on  uh huh   and uh mumbles   irate tram users are they mad because of the  schedule not being kept or  mhh   does it mention   no   hmm   ya here we have this committee for the  to help children and i i'm  still not quite sure if it has anything to do with those   that that massive influx of articles or if this is yet another organization  mhh   i'm not sure  it looks different  it does doesn't it  that looks like the medical seal or the seal for the  the pediatric uhm associ  association or pediatric whatever they're called  of america   ya   little baby in swaddling   hmm i'll look at it carefully  this international organization   hmm and they talk about delinquency   that's all they talk about in the newspaper  seem more focusing on delinquency in the  newspapers   laugh   all the time   ya   uh here this is interesting  this is the last day of the european war  mhh hmm  and i just thought it was interesting cos there's still so much request for female work  and this is like may fifth nineteen forty-five the day   the germans surrender  so i thought it's sort of historically significant that on that day there's still massive amounts of work wanted  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  at least for the short term until the men start returning  ya   imperial tobacco was still on the foremost  ya   ya  uh here's an article about uh women and feminism and their kind of you know uhm sort of ex explaining their   point of view that's word but at the same time sort of uh  i don't know  i feel it's almost like a mockery  it's uh not overt but it seems to be an underlying  disdain for these women feminists you  know   mhh   mhh   what does re  reine ah queen reine aux es  cla ves sounding out word   queen queen of slaves   queen of slaves  ya   so it's like uhm you know it seems to be  that's kind of radical  and i think that's what the speakers are saying but uh just the article seems to be i don't know kind of a   a one-sided thing  mhh hmm   here we have this  uh remember the the the daycare in the train station for women and the women just keep on coming in with their families  oh yes   mhh hmm   which is turning out to be the most highly-visible   daycare service when really it's just such a special  interest special use thing  one or two days while they uhm decide on which train to catch or just to give them a layover time before moving on  highly-visible right   i know but we're constantly seeing it   that's right  this uh kind of goes it ties in with the rest of the stuff  this is an ah a later article about the province and their uh new new approach   and their new costs and   oh yes   mhh hmm  and this is just kind of ah an aside but it's a picture of  a daycare in a garderie in china  oh peculiar   and they're just kind of   ya  they just kind of say look there's a garderie  in china  all of a sudden this pops up  it doesn't say  now was it visited by <,, someone from quebec  laugh no   that's right  just kind of like there it is  it does   word must be a model  daycare or something   ya uh   it talks about the daycare uhm being part of services for women under the ministry of education as if this would be   as if it would be a model almost for quebec but as it turns out uhm  it wasn't   ya   ya and i was wondering on a conspiracy theory  that they're anti- garderies   they may be saying you know look at these savages you know  they're laugh they're doing that and we we we're above that  why   it's actually presented in a positive light though  ya ya it is  but it's funny because it's so disassociated isn't it  it is   it's just this picture with a little  caption and it seems to have nothing   we rarely have world news in the paper   i mean of that kind  ya 
Canada	 ya  oh here's here's uh mister houde  who's talking now  he's he's out of jail and   and he's talking and uh we're all happy to see him again  oh yes   and there's another fire  and they refer  laugh ya i know  you know it was so funny  there was fires every second day   laugh i shouldn't laugh but they're   it was horrible  and you'd think my god was there like was there like massive amounts of sabotage going on  laugh   were there german spies running around laugh setting fires to all this  cos it's like ya constantly  entrep&ocircumflex;t uh warehouses  you know and businesses and you're thinking  was this just really bad you know uhh zoning or or  or uh were they just really poorly made constructions  that that were lent themselves to fire  a terrible thought   ya   i think that's probably the case  they didn't have fire walls or uh whatever else you need to contain a fire if once it started it spread   ya   okay certainly that's probably  i mean the i the fire in the  garderie in maine i'm did that turn up  in the uh papers  no   she hasn't reached that yet  that's going to be february forty-  two forty-five   you it could be interesting   oh okay   phrase  sounds in the background, as though speaking to another person   cos it likely would have a big impact   on the way people thought it   uhm institutions   it should   that's right   that's right  and here we have more on the tramways   i was just looking at these chaps beating each other  up maybe two words   ya there's actually a better picture of that here  i've got the the word  part  it's apparently a a rebellion in uhm  uhm  what is  it's the fourth of april forty-five  it's a rebellion in germany against the nazis  mhh   basically people are  well the this that's what they've been saying anyways  mhh hmm   i didn't carry those  this just but i thought it was interesting cos they have three pictures here  it's basically these people beating up nazis  mhh hmm  and they're claiming of one of the headlines  was like you know there's a revolt in germany against the nazis  it's a little late  uh ya  april  ya laugh it's true eh  and uh so you just kind of  mhh hmm  uhm and it this is interesting  this is ah a delegation for the rights of women the wives of soldiers basically and uh i haven't read the whole article yet but i can see there's some sort of tie-in to the daycare  mhh hmm   i mean if they're asking for their rights are they going to ask for you know daycare or are they going to go the other way and say no we want money  mhh hmm   uh like the fed federal   like the provincial government seems to want to do  is to give family allocations which would basically eliminate the need for uh women to work and yet solve the problem of child poverty at the  same time   mhh hmm   mhh all right  that's certainly the alternative that was put forth over and over again give mothers money to stay at home  mhh   ya  and uh what's this   oh ya accidents of the tramway  remember i was telling you that tramway accidents are very  here's another one  they're very uh   that's   what are they  running over people  ya  running over people crashing into things   basically laugh their drivers are really bad from what i can ascertain from these articles   ya laugh any course   a couple words   they're just ya unqualified and probably women from our our previous uh   hmm three accidents and two deaths yesterday afternoon   my gosh that's just in a in one  day   ya   here's another one of these things about the children  remember this thing  but all of the sudden they're talking about czech children  they're talking about taking care of children from other  ya it seems to be an international organization that might be  because post war there's their europe is  in a state of total disorganization and there're thousands of children who have lost their parents or who are uhm cut off from knowing how to to contact them   so there's family unification is  huge issue  so i think it's reporting on that   half a million people under the age of twenty-five   now this is uh something they call the s   the the house for children  i'm not quite sure if it's for uhm children with problems or uhm uh physical problems or children with physical problems who've been abandoned but they do talk about the war the effects of the war  mhh hmm   they're going to create this house for a certain number of these children and it 's ties in well with  some of the stuff brenna's found about alternate  mhh   okay  and th and this is in france   ya these are these are  the st already established  of these are the ones that we found over   i mean right from the beginning   ya whereas this sounds   ya   grey nuns  that's right  oh okay   whereas this sounds more like it's a new thing  ya   and a again it's sort of a pulling away  it's ah more towards a secular  social services than the one that was established by the nuns and everything but i think the two tie together  mhh hmm   ya   but it was made exclusively for for  infants that are have uhm   physical and  mental word   ya physical problems   but i'm i'm really  gonna going to have to read the two articles side by side   yes   i i like to  see it in france though   oh is it  ya  ohh  this is in france uhm   is it   oh ya  look at that   okay   beau soleil so  and it's it sounds really interesting  oh so maybe  okay it's just word   a few words thought  it's modelled on the ideas of rousseau and very progressive and libertarian   ya   ya uh i didn't notice it   but it's wrong  wrong country though   it funny cos there's a lot   ya  there's a lot of articles that i've sort of   you go oh this is great and then you realize that it's not  like word laugh   laugh   yes   it's not uh here  it's over there  oh i know   there's a lot about taking care of the kids  there's a whole   series of stuff that comes up in the french paper about taking care of the kids overseas  which also seems to just peter out  word that   hmm   hmm   there's this one thing about you know  similar to the ad campaign which is about  social services but it's about overseas children and children of france  starts in late forty-four and then just kind of peters out  in early forty-five   yes   hmm   mhh hmm   uhh kay okay   uh oh that's just the me trying to copy that same   word here   all right   okay the dreams of children  they're j gonna going to do some revamping of the educational system  so it's this whole thing of of social systems just constantly being you know different parts of it being picked up  mhh hmm   okay and this is holland  but it's an interesting id idea  uh it's interesting but around the world   this same ideas are  exactly   we're we're gonna  going to have to start over  ya and it's   helps   i'm sorry  i was looking at the wrong one  i don't understand very quiet   but that's   they rev this is this is uhm montreal   ya   ya  but that that's it's interesting in the fact that and as you pointed out and actually that french one can still be used in that context is that it's a worldwide thing  ya   mhh hmm   it's like like you said last week i mean war does really perpetuate social change and  that's what we're seeing  mhh hmm   the war is ending and suddenly everywhere everyone is going to change everything  use it as a chance to start fresh  ya   at least that's what we find  ya  so uhm here's this thing about  it kind of connects to that previous article about inscription of children again  again they're they 're want   to write down  they want to know all the children   they uh you know the it's   just part of this whole sort of duplessis   mhh hmm   and the interesting thing about it is it's almost a precursor to the duplessis orphanages   hmm   it's the setting up of this infamous duplessis orphanages  it's plenty to see that in retrospect   by counting the children and keeping   well they have to count the   and special needs of children would be turning up in this  ya  and i may be reading too much into it but i think what we're seeing is uh part of duplessis' uhm grand scheme to uh take the power away from the church cos up until that point of course the church was responsible for so many facets of uh s  social welfare  mhh hmm  uh the schools were basically run by the church  mhh hmm  uh the hospitals the the  cr&egrave;ches so much is run by  and this is i think his attempt to take away that  hmm   so the fact he's counting children now i think  is very like it's the first step   you know  i see   ya   he's hired five hundred employees to do this  this is a large number   mhh hmm   this is a big project  word   this is not a small thing   okay  now here's just kind of an interesting article on just  poverty in general  they're just showing these really shabby conditions   these uh   they often do that  they show these pictures and then they don't really  follow up  mhh hmm  uh it's just kind of an article and just showing you how terrible life is and not really a mention of what's going to be done or who's going to do anything about  it   mhh   mhh hmm   but there's constantly these pictures of these really shabby living conditions  mhh hmm   this is the same area that you uh pointed out the photos before  mhh hmm   ya it looks the same but i don't even know if it is the same area  it word ahh   i think it's just basically there was an abundance of shabby-looking things that all kind of looked  alone   of the same so that uh  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  uhm okay that's not important   let's go stay with the children for now  uhh oh ya  this is kind of nice   a few words   this is more about the more of these children arriving the war brides with their children   and their children are getting older   i've seen those ya   ya   you've seen the same   ya  ya   these children some of them are three years old it looks  like   ya   page nine uhm hmm  and uh as for social problems here this woman's being arrested for beating her two kids   and who's that woman with the umbrella  oh this has i guess this is just a report on the weather  oh i see   the the picture has nothing to do with the article  it's just the general kind of picture that there was a  really rainy day  oh oh oh   i think it's february and it's raining and i think that's very unusual and they're kind of commenting on that   ahh   is it le mari et la femme  word   the husband and wife   uh three rivers   was she a working uh wage-earning woman i wonder   uh it doesn't say that but i don't think that's the issue  word   it's just the fact that that  suddenly something that was pretty much accepted before is suddenly  not accepted  mhh hmm   mhh   the beginning of the end of corporal punishment as a means of disciplining your children  i mean i it's a pretty extreme case but  uhm  mhh hmm   it's uhm they discovered the baton  eighteen pouces   i thought pouces was  fleas but the in in    eighteen pouces p o u c e s   could be inches   inches long   in what context  i guess they're describing how long this stick was  oh it'd be stick was eighteen inches long  so that would be two or three words     okay  that's that's a pretty big stick ya   laugh   that's a that's a   big stick   that's a big stick ya   pouces   ya  and three quarts of pouce   well pouces is  is inches but would we have three quarters of an inch
Canada	 so it's sortasort of hard to get my fish  stuff in  mm  wow  but i decorated the uhm door  i bought the thing from moyers it has ocean  oh  it's so neat  and it has like three d things coming out and kids love  that  wow  like and all the teachers are really excited about  that so  mm hmm  tha yeah that's fun   uhm and besides that everything's going okay   but uhm  how did that uhm system work out   for the teacher the uhm  the sound system  cool  well  the sound system  yes  uhm they're not getting it  it's too expensive  okay  it was fifteen hundred dollars for each classroom  so it was really  one or two words  oh wow  so how long did you have it for  it's actually still in our class and nobody uses it now  hmm  hmm  i guess itit was the novelty sort of  wore off  right  like we were all so excited and now it's just  word  ooh and you can put in this fish tape the ocean like tape and it group laughs  while you were talking while you were talking i was thinking of going to the floor uhm next door and they have all the tapes of that  that must be so great for you  okay yeah  of you can get the ocean and  i hadn't thought of that  yeah yeah  mm hmm     yeah     that'd be so cool  and if you put it on the surround sound thing  they'll one or two words  group laughs  i was thinking of reading that story that we've been talking about  yes  word talking about the mood and i was thinking of ways that i can do that     yeah  yes  yeah so i might do that   that would be good  so i'm gonnagoing to do that  that would be good  and i also said to a few words  the last time i was there  if y if you got a hockey net     a few words  you know and just sort of put it across   they have a small class so you can't really do everything   in you know on the floor     mm hmm  but if you had a hockey net and sort of draped it over the ceiling and then stuffed fish you know with paper and  then you sort of have  them sort of   floating in there you have like a     yeah     cough   but i was wondering  how would you  you mean you have to take off the net part right from  or even a uh a hammock  just a net  or a hammock  yeah   but but only if it's like a see-through kind of thing     yeah     yeah  yeah yeah     you know like not one of these laugh  group laughter     a few words     phrase  phrase     yes dyeah  anything that's sort of netty or see-through   uh could be used to be draped across uhm a  corner  yeah  like laundry bags  like the laundry bags for camping  exactly that's a word  like those camp laundry bags would be good  yeah  well the school must have some badminton nets or rope or things  or even if you just tie uhm   tie yarn     yeah  tie threethree or four  five lines strings on  knots  and then just pa paper clip them     strips   oh no no no  i tried that for word  laugh and it collapsed on me laugh  oh okay  laugh  a few words  yeah  you know what  it's much easier if you have something  readymade  ya yeah  and if you have a big sort of net fabric  yeah  just to drape it around  yeah  just so that you can see if you do an art activity and you have them sort of make fish and  oh yeah   yeah     and then you can sort of have them     hanging   from the ceiling   into the  net   add some shells word  how word  fish a few words       a few words  that's right  mm hmm  well i'm also making a big river   i told the kids i'm doing this already  now they're all excited so now i have to like follow through  do that  so now it's like i have to do this     laugh  i have this massive box  and i gave half of it to charlotte cos she's doing a rocketship for her space  so she's doing that so i figured i'd use the other half to make a  word huge   so i'm gonnagoing to like paint that blue and do things with that  yes  that's great  ya     mm  i dunnodon't know when you're  gonnagoing to have time to do everything  alannah but uh  i know  i know  there aren't that many days like  mm  really there aren't  oh and then next monday

stay in the classroom  there's a parent volunteer she'll stay  i want you to go so you can see the parents and   and see what kind of questions they ask and  okay i'll go mrs klink  and uhm i'm glad i

of them talked  butbut you know they'll be quiet or you can just go like this and they turn around and they listen   and uhm i'm about to tell max to not play with the ducks that i brought in  like they know when they come in they don't play with the ducks  i'm like max you don't play with the ducks  and the parent volunteer goes hey hey shh shh finger click finger click all laugh  and word like any soccer coach  and the first time she said something  ii word all laugh  i thought she was gonnagoing to hit me  all laugh  and i was just completely turned off   i just kindakind of looked at her like  yeah okay can ican i start now all laugh  and i'm sure the kids saw my reaction cos i was like hmmm  all laugh  who is this person all laugh  and i thought okay i'm just a student teacher  maybe she thinks i don't have control of the kids but even when mrs dinglebear came back she would just completely cut her off  and oh it was awful  awful awful   well you had an experience annabelle  oh my goodness  you had an experience  oh my goodness  but working with the parents can help too i  driving in a friend rides in with me and  she'sshe's a resource teacher well not a resource teacher she's uhm uhm you're not a tech and you're not an independent  word  she helps withwith problem children  and there was  occupational  yes thank you laugh  didn't come to me laugh  and she had problems with this one boy that kept he would not sit in his chair  he'd slide on the floor and he'd do this and that  they tried everything to get him to sit still and he was in grade one  well they spoke to the mother  and the mother came in and hid behind a screen  and this boy was doing everything and he wouldn't get in his chair and then she motioned you know to my friend and says to her can i come out now and she said yes  so she came out and kindakind of tapped him on the shoulder and said sit in the chair   he's sat in the chair ever since  you know and the kid's looking at the screen where's my   mother  is she here today laugh     oh all laugh  really  yeah  no problems ever since so  oh wow  it's good to keep that communication  laugh  oh yeah  yeah  i had an interesting parent volunteer on friday     laugh  did you  sheit was recess and i was  preparing for saint patrick's day and i was putting things out   and she approaches me and just completely tells off  the irish people  and sheshe told me you know ah  the  i ii couldn't use the words in this  inin this room to day how she described them but that they  i i can safely say that they come to my city and blow upthey blow up my country and you celebrate them and just   so i'm smiling and nodding and all laugh  being that polite diplomatic allegria student that i am   and uhm i just  and i'd had noti was not having a good day and i was   it's not that i wasn't having a good day  it's just that i been re working really hard at  gaining my enthusiasm to do this story-telling of saint patrick   and she was staying with me for the rest of the day and she's the only a other adult in the room     oh word   mm hmm  so she's sitting across from me during this story-telling and she just has this this deathly look on her like   almost as if i have no right to be presenting saint patrick to these children   it was awful  yeah  well i didn't believe that i was going to get through  that  yeah yeah  she shouldn't have volunteered on that particular day  no  i wanted to tell her well i'm half-irish and i don't have a blohabit of blowing up people  yeah yeah group laughs  i didn't do that     no but if you stay here longer i will group laughs   you know it's a bright colour against a dark background it's the orange and the green right  formally it could have like maybe a third colour in there   mm hmm  you know shadows overlaps fade out  you know it could have more visual or just more of  interesting brushwork in the marks 
Canada	 stuff like that i grew up with like looking at in you know  i don't know if you were reading the newspaper or going to like uhh a repertory cinema or something like that  mm hmm  i got those feelings like in a sense i am trying to date it more but i can understand what you mean in the sense of why is this object in you know like the memory  well maybe it could should be combined with another other images beside it  like let's say uh you have the sources that come from uh  perhaps if you juxtapose things that come from different sources that might be interesting  so that it's not only this memory of the cinematic images of those posters  mm hmm  but what other kind of things was were   going on then  what was happening in politics  mm hmm  uhh you know what was happening in your personal life  like i think maybe that the memory could be elaborated   to include other things and have a series of things one beside the other so they kind of form a more complex kind of vision  oh i see what you mean yeah   you know like i think of uhh like something   did you lose the w   like i'm just running through ideas now that you just  provoked it  yeah phone rings   scuse excuse me speaker a is on the phone for about 1 minute   hello  yeah so i was just thinking you're talking about juxtapositioning i could add more memories into the drawing i'm thinking  but would you lose the focus of the main issue if i added like you know uh water pistols and you know all kinds of stuff that i can remember of the seventies growing up and stuff like that  with you know this too or whatever i'm thinking would i lose stuff or would i gain things from that  well i'm just thinking of   would it be more juicier in conent in a sense if you looked at something like i dunno don't know maybe just looking at a lotta lot of nostalgia and memories  well i would start by thinking of just other objects but i was thinking like what else was going on in the seventies besides those posters  like there were you know there could be  other sources  there could be uh newspaper articles uhm there could be uh you know personal photography references  so there could be you know pri the private realm and the public realm  the realm of media uh you know there could be copies of drawings that you did  mm hmm   i mean there could be layers maybe it's not in this particular image all stuck into the same thing but you know you could have a row of them or a serial thing  yeah well that's in a sense what i'm doing   with the with the objects themselves ah  like you know i   i'd like to like i haven't put   them all like both the the  posters up yet in a sense but   mm hmm  i dunno don't know if they're   gonna going to work as a series of objects or whatever  like if i do the mountain the owl the ebony carving and uh i dunno don't know one more  i was thinking of the the dinosaur the one that my brother dr my brother carved  or whatever  i was thinking those four objects together like i think the dinosaur's gonna be one that has a lot of   but you see those i think are all still sort of a nostalgia image that comes from the movies you know around uh fantasy animals and  mm hmm  you know fantasy images that are from science fiction and things like that   but that something that was a large part of my childhood though fantasy  right  i you know i grew up just  making up games in your head and stuff like that  i wasn't nintendo boy at all you know  mm hmm  and that's something i find different in the age today where all these kids are just you know video games video games t v t v t v  you know   mm hmm   i was quite the t v fanatic and buff but we also had you know a free run of you know fields and you know playing with plastic dinosaurs and creating games and stuffed animals and creating games and characters and you know all kinds of  we were very animated children as w you know the street  so are you saying because they weren't on the screen like somehow there's more of a human kind of personal  oh yeah definitely it's very   i mean like you're imagining a time that was sort of kinder or softer  is that one of these things that you're trying to get across  yeah i think so  i think i'm just trying to capture you know uh uhhh a lot of for me i get a lot of nostalgia feeling from it like i just you know sit back and look at it and i can remember you know being yay big you know looking at stuff like this and going oh my god you know like  i remember seeing alfred hitchcock's uh the birds or whatever for the first time and that just terrified me and now i look at it and go like ohhh you know like breath   but back then it was something like i would have nightmares  on days on end just like oh my god they're coming to get me  i think that's something i'm trying to evoke in this too just  the the kitschiness of you know being scared and you know the boogeyman and  you know stuff like that and i think the owl had like that feeling too  being a centrepiece in the living room you know like  it was always there and it was always sort of like you know oooh you know spooky and scary-looking and stuff like that  uh huh   breath in a sense that's what i'm trying to accomplish i think more in the objects  but i can see in a sense what you're saying with you know how do you the viewer get that and i don't know if i'm coming across that well in conveying these messages you know like  well that's why i was sort of thinking that if they were you know like in this kind of format here you know where you have   maybe utterance   you know in this image by larry rivers you know you have these fragments of things so it appears like more like stream of co    mm hmm   like formally he's created a space and a composition that is something like stream of consciousness or could easily apply  to memory as well  loud cough   like i'm just thinking first of all the mark  the mark you're suggesting is very permanent  i could see that maybe   like each object is defined you know in a very permanent looking kind of way  mm hmm   it it should be a little more fragmented do you think  well i think that perhaps if you handled it  i'm not   i dunno don't know   exactly how to do it   yeah   i can see what you're getting at word    but if i you know think about that like just uhh as i was saying before about memory  yeah  uhm swallows you know that memory   it's different  is always a little   the image you have of something in your mind even though it's very clear uh is different than when you're actually going through it in the moment  so there's formally i would say that you could explore things that noise in background uh evoke that aspect  and that's why i was showing you that image because it formally suggests a composition that could evoke it   i think uhm i think i could get   you know   yeah i think what i'm missing maybe a little more in these drawings is maybe writing like blurbs of memory   or if i look at the writing here like  one of it's an artwork so what distinguishes uhm you know writing for information and writing that's for art  mm  you know like how would you make a distinction   you know like in here the writing becomes a formal part of the composition it has the the kind of sort of uh you know change and variation and nuance that the painter and the marks have  like there are you know some of them are wiped out and s   yeah no i can see   you know there's a certain   there is definitely the relation  yeah there's a relationship between all the marks and the handwriting  the colour   so these are things to consider uhm that might be employed in the piece  and again in the one of the cheese like there was a liveliness to the marks you know they they had more of some of these qualities you know  they they seem to have some of your  handwriting along with the handwriting like  yeah okay  and you know made them kind of more interesting  mm hmm  so uhm or even something like this you know where you've got the handwriting  there's something you know a bit brutal about the way this is handled so that it becomes more than sort of copying the look of a particular poster  right  you know because it's not enough like in an artwork like  we ex you know like we would demand  more  you think i'm being a little too formal maybe  i would say   maybe i should   it's not that you're being too formal i think the content like i would want a little more sense of irony in it of some critical edge  like i don't find i'm getting enough of a challenge   from it intellectually or enough of an edge in the statement   yeah   and i'm wondering how to problematize it you know so that there's more of of </} content that comes through  and i could show you some things   do you know marlene dumas' work  no humming pause for about twenty seconds  you know so if i take an image like this which comes from a polaroid photograph that has been you know painted and you know not in similar colours to the ones you're using  but there's uhm you know a kind of exploration of things that are tight things that are looser you know just getting into the play of  the materials more and no it's not   just a reco repeating of the polaroid photograph but bringing it into sort of orginal artwork  word   i saw it's ralph steadman laugh  drawing a bit of himself a self portrait  oh yeah  off a polaroid half the face is just going crazy and half the face is sketched out half his face and half of it is a photograph but yeah the colours just change the whole thing  oh yeah   very quiet muttering starts i'm just trying to find some of the text in them i had some slides with text   very quiet muttering ends   oh yeah like here you know it says pregnant you know nineteen eighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine uhm  what'd she write on the thing there  yeah she writes you know uhh it's called the cover-up you know so the title is ironic you know cos we can't think of the word cover-up without thinking of nixon and  yeah  it's more it has like a lay an intellectual content   i guess what i'm feeling is that i would like to see more of an intellectual content in that  laugh   okay  you know and formally i find that you know things uh being so much the same treatment everywhere you know i don't find it as formally interesting as the one with the cheese in that in that sense  mkay okay   you know like all the libraries that'd be wearing this  material would be all  like they're not exactly slick and they're not exactly awkward or expressionistic they're sort of somewhere in between  mm hmm  and they sort of hover  i don't know like their intention is a little uh unclear to me  mm hmm  you know we talked about that you know the handwriting maybe you should get more like graffiti maybe it should be slicker maybe some of it should be like graffiti and some of it should be airbrushed some of it should be stencilled or you know like maybe you should do one that's just a composition with just the letters and see what kind of composition you can work out with just the words  you know a composition using words and dealing with spaces in between the letters and seeing what you could do with that 
Canada	 good morning  beautiful morning out there isn't it right now   isn't it glorious   it's that red red sky  yes  yeah uh we got a beautiful cityscape on our ah traffic monitor right now which isn't s showing  traffic  but that's no problem because there's no traffic to show really  to speak of laugh   mhm   fine then we'll take the pleasant city view yeah     all the routes into town working very well right now  from the west island southshore and laval  ah no delays accidents stalled cars to report on the metropolitan or c&ocircumflex;te de liesse or d&eacute;carie expressway  just ah one thing off island down the uh jean-lesage autoroute again  unfortunately uh this not quite so serious an accident as we   re reported yesterday and it's also a bit closer to montreal at sainte-rosalie which is about one hundred and forty kilometres east of montreal uh  a two car accident there and apparently one injury but again not as serious as the other one that we reported yesterday  also it is uh these things seem to come in  in   batches like this   it's odd though two days in a row i mean you rarely uh    waves yeah   uh when we had problems oh on the island of montreal uh uh on the  twenty again at woodland they   they came in a batch and so uh it's just the way things work it seems  so well let's hope that the uh if there is a problem there will be co corrected     same word mmm yeah   we'll hope this is the last of many   there is a lot of construction going on on the uh jean-lesage autoroute  these days   mhm   in fact in sainte-rosalie we had one lane closed yesterday i don't know if it was closed overnight or not  i'll check into that  so people might wanna want to  watch it if they're heading out today  yeah that might cause confusion   now is that your theme music jeanne   the leafing through the paper music   mhm   i don't know it's very uhm courtly i guess   i it would be   suitable   i guess   except that this morning i wanted to open with a sports story   uhm   so i guess it's not directly i guess you couldn't say that word not really the adequate scene for that  but anyway it's uhm again the story of bruny surin and donovan bailey and it's the lead story in la presse local newspaper with a big photograph of the two guys smiling  from mi you know from  ear to ear and the the lead is uh is  ils s'entendent comme la comme des larrons en foire   now the word larrons i had to go and consult with our french colleagues  it's a kind of an uh a mediaeval term meaning uh something like the court jester  so these two guys clearly are having a great time  that's what the la presse is suggesting  it says that they're friendly rivals who are proud to be the first  double canadian winners in track   and that they had two golds in the swedish competition to prove that they're the best in the world and to put the ghost of ben johnson to rest   that's a ghost that's been hanging around since nineteen eighty-eight  and ah they're very much enjoying being treated like international stars in sweden  mmm mmm   it's lively it's lively   mhm   not a natural link no   beau-   mmm   oh   mhm   mhm   ah well they really do look like they're glowing  it's funny yesterday there was some comment from another athlete who said you know i'm sure bruny isn't too disappointed and i thought yeah i didn't see disappointment exactly   laugh   word pretty enjoyable all round   no word looked pretty happy   yeah i think he's really enjoying being the   the centre of attention over there   uhm in the gazette and the globe as well as on the front page of le devoir local newspapers the uh the story of the serb refugees in the krajina ah  and the  number being quoted is a hundred and  twenty thousand in the gazette  hmm   next wave   gee hmm   ah croatia says its three day military operation to take over the krajina is over and they will now clear out ah the five thousand serb rebels left  ah this the ah this is an attack that shocked the world  the croatian army ah you know unexpectedly well-prepared and ah  aggressive here  and ah there are reports of attacks on serb refugees by croat troops according to the international committee of the red cross  and looting of towns  so it it's really a conflict in which there don't seem to be any good guys  ah it's very hard to ah to understand  that's just it even ah as you look at the different sides  and i think that's what's so discouraging about it is uh  no lines drawn  no there's no no one has the moral high road on this one   no no  ah in le devoir the lead story  quebec's youngest politician mario dumont twenty-five years old on the pre-referendum campaign trail and he's sort of on the damage control trail i guess you could say the lead the title is  dumont will respect the tra- tripartite  agreement   this is an agreement that was arrived at in june between the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, the p q and dumont's action d&eacute;mocratique  political parties in quebec   and last week he got himself into a bit of hot water when he told  le devoir he was uneasy about the proposed bill that the p q has put forward that would declare quebec sovereign  he wants a vote on sovereignty specifically and wants a negotiating committee that would include federalists on it and this was very upsetting to uh montreal p q activists some of whom threatened to resign  uhm so uh he's hel called a newser  to clarify this and he said that he'd like parizeau to modify the proposed bill to include the terms of the june agreement and he wants a sovereignty partnership with canada &aacute; la bourassa  just so funny about dumont i the photo of him on the back page of the front section of the devoir   he looks like bourassa   he even st he's even standing there with his the tips  of his fingers together   it's quite hilarious i i must say  anyway so uh  he well definitely a follower  hmm mm   oh   he words mannerisms that's right    yeah he seems a student of his   but yeah ah week by week uhm i- it's   back and forth with him certainly isn't it  uh the signing there wa- wasn't  uh a word mentioned of any any kind of uhm problems with whatever he was signing on for and then suddenly a little distance from it and now no no it'll be fine it's just a few changes   he's having reservations yes yeah   and the reaction of the media to this whole thing is interesting  it's the top of the full story in le devoir  it's not mentioned in la presse and it's buried in the gazette laugh so   oh yeah way deep in a tiny little mention   people fighting the uh the uh  referendum agenda oh   well i think there'll be a lot more stories of that nature to come   i think so yeah  la presse uh has a- on   the front page also the a weird story with a big photograph that also got a a big play in  le journal but not in uh not in the   english media  uh these two sort of dingy looking characters being arrested by the tactical squad in scott junction just south of quebec city near  sainte-marie-de-beauce   now this is the community where the undertaker  the local undertaker killed his daughter and the police chief and then himself just a little while ago  unfortunate community  entirely too many ah strange and uh dismaying laugh  stories coming out of that region there's somthing about it  mmm   and this is a this is a sect apparently  these two guys are gonna going to be accused of kidnapping and confinement  uh the police uhm found a seventeen year-old girl and her sister  who'd been reported disappeared inside a compound called the  domaine moreau which is like a sa uh   th the presse  describes as a stone bunker-like structure surrounded by barbed wire  very odd story which i'm sure we'll be hearing some more about  mmm   hmm mmm  in la presse an exclusive story concerning haiti a country we haven't heard too much about in the news in the last week or two  bishop willy rom&eacute;luse of j&eacute;r&eacute;mie which is on the far western part of the island uhm  and also this uh this was a person who was uhn nominated for the nineteen ninety-five nobel prize  he's the only church leader in haiti to oppose publicly  to have opposed publicly raoul c&eacute;dras's military uh junta  he's in montreal for a couple of days  he's be he'll be staying at the well-known uh french-speaking quebecoise actor's actress'  ang&egrave;le coutu's place  and uhm speaking and doing work on behalf of his uh his parish in haiti  he also opposed the vatican which recognized the government of c&eacute;dras  a very courageous man  and he's not officially being received by the quebec church but only uh by the haitian community  and of course there are forty thousand haitian quebecers here in montreal  so interesting story that no one else picked up on  in le devoir a review of the uh  francofolie festival again  and fran&ccedille;ois panier the reviewer calls it an  unorthodox francofolie festival  he says the conseille de la langue fran&ccedille;aise  french language promotion council is nowhere to be seen  and uh this is a good thing  and he talks about word a sixty-three year-old french from france folky who ah had a who performed  last night and said from the stage c'est en anglais j'ai le droit   he asked permission to sing in english  sorry he said it so- somewhat  sarcastically  and he went ahead and sang blowing in the wind in english  and uhm le devoir this reveiwer  is happy to say that the festival is multilingual  there's uh kashtin singing in montagnais there's afiletta singing in corsican and he's happy to see this mixture of language and cultures  something of an evolution for the francofolie then  new and different and very happy about that  and apparently aufrey is known for his translation of  goodnight irene which is translated to be  rosinne bonsoir which i i don't think i've ever heard  no that's odd   laugh so uhm and finally in  la presse also another musical story about the casavant uh pipe organ uh company in sainte uh ya  sainte uhm  just a sort of a feature profile of this company and the title is casavant paying a prosperous air   laugh   this is the organ that uh this is the organ company that built the organ in the saint-jean-baptiste church in the plateau district on rachel   word yeah   they're renowned around the world for uh for their uh incredibly uh uhm successful uh attempts to modify and update the pike pipe organ but using the original uh p- plan and original materials  they have seventy-five employees and they export eighty to ninety percent of their instruments all around the world  all over europe and ak- apparently  their big uh success right now is exports to japan where there's great interest in pipe organ music  ah extraordinary  well thank you very much and uh someone will be back with us   word     and good night alana laugh   good night jeanne laugh   we'll just uhm go back for a second to the francofolie which is uhm running all this week certainly in montreal  uhm we've got a little of the sounds of the francofolie uh  a song from uh danny boudreau who will be playing tomorrow at les midis in complexe desjardins  ah this is a song called un peu de pluie   song   ah such expressions of tenderness and devotion from danny boudreau  ah a performer from ah new brunswick who'll be playing at the francofolie  he's uh taking the stage tomorrow at noon at  complexe desjardins les midis complexe desjardins   uhm lovely song from him certainly we're all swaying and flicking our bics lighters here in the studio laugh   aren't we campbell jeffrey ? laugh   ooh laugh 
Canada	 thanks very much matt   twenty-six minutes now after eight  here's don white   a four two win for the canadiens last night in the first post patrick roy era game word   can't argue with that   no you can't  everytime there's change the canadiens ice hockey team do well for a short while anyway  they beat the devils last night at the montreal forum  it doesn't get easier  they play the penguins in pittsburgh tonight  mario lemieux is the top scorer in the n h l  national hockey league   and he's got some great linemates as well  and this will be a true test as vincent damphousse has said for the montreal canadiens  but now that we've had a few minutes or a few hours a few days to  sit back and digest what has gone on here let's look at the facts of the montreal canadiens  there are now only four players left from the team that won the stanley cup only two and a half years ago  which tells you that the canadiens were not happy with winning the stanley cup  obviously most teams would be thrilled to win it even with the problems that montreal allegedly had at the time  that patrick roy won the stanley cup for them  well it's true they got by because of patrick roy and the play of  john leclair and ahh the a couple of other defensemen uh j j daigneault one of them who played pretty well eric desjardins who is now in philidelphia  all these key players are gone  the ones who are left are uhh patrice brisebois benoi&icircumflex;t brunet lyle odelein and vincent damphousse  so the canadiens have changed a lot  now there are nine europeans on the team including four russians  don cherry is going to have something to say about that saturday night when the canadiens host the new york rangers   montreal slavs laugh   oh he's not going to be happy about it i can tell you that  already he's not  but that's probably a good thing isn't it i mean isn't it   you see this and this is where some of the criticism about this trade that was made uh for martin rucinsky and jocelyn thibault and andrei kovalenko is that kovalenko and rucinsky not necassarily known for their hard nosed play  they don't bring toughness and character to this team  and that's exactly what the canadiens were missing and they got rid of lot of it when they let captain mike keane and patrick roy go to the colorado avalanche  and we'll hear mario tremblay put it all in perspective here  speech by mario tremblay   well weird thing said at the end there  but but why trade him if he was  had so much heart and was so great for the organization and loved him so much  offensively he wasn't producing  but that's not the point  the whole point dates back to the preseason when mike keane was named captain of the montreal canadiens  mike are you going to learn french   ahh no it's not necessary guys was his answer   uhh we don't speak french in the locker room here     punishment punishment   but what about last little that last little   clip clip there   bad p r   mario tremblay is just already abdicating the stanley cup  give it up  might be closer to a cup there   oh well  other scores  uhh other scores  yes we do have some uh l a kings over winnipeg six three hartford beat the islanders seven four tampa bay over anaheim two one rangers and chicago tied at five  the atlanta games opening ceremonies  they're not releasing the doves next year  it will be a symbolic gesture  whatever that means  they haven't explained what it is  to start off the games at the opening ceremonies   what think it's unfair to doves or something  well they're worried that they say it's cruelty to birds and animals and and groups are getting down on them  i can imagine because of all the planes flying overhead during the ceremonies  welcome to the modern world  twenty-nine minutes now after eight   and that's john hiatt with the song you must go from his latest album walk on  john hiatt's at the spectrum tonight  samuel derry> is here this morning to talk about hiatt  also talking about danielle martineau uhh the montreal princess of zydeco  she's got a new c d and also will be playing at caf&eacute; campus   good morning samuel   laugh   we laugh we just made   laugh   morning hoyle   just being thrown across the studio here  yeah some of our laugh   but   no the action never ends in daybreak that   laugh   not not only does someone come in with seconds to spare and say change your microphone  but samuel flings himself into a chair that unfortunately has wheels on it  that's right i i went flying  and i i have now picked myself up off the floor and am ready to talk about john hiatt  returning to his classical roots  yeah he really is  hiatt's last album was a   oh yeah classic roots sorry   well let me i should say classic roots  not classical laugh mumble     cos actually classical yeah classical   does not uhh does not apply to john hiatt  it really is classic roots rock  um his his last album was a record called perfectly good guitar which was kind of a musical departure for this rootsy singer songwriter  cos it featured a tougher louder uhh really guitar sound that was inspired by a new generation of grungy rockers like nirvana and soul asylum  i kinda kind of liked it but  word it was hardly uh john hiatt's best uh record  um but the latest album from this indiana-born rocker which is called walk on is really much closer to the back to basics down home sound that's been hiatt's trademark for a number of years  um, in fact this new album is really reminiscent of the great mid-eighties albums from hiatt  records like bring the family and slow turning  which i think most people consider to be john hiatt's best albums  um and it really goes back to that classic roots sound  though there is still there's a couple sort of hard rockers there as well  so what do you think  one of his better albums this new one  i think it is actually  i mean it's his best album probably still is bring the family but walk on is a very strong album  um a song like you must go which is what we were just listening to is really the perfect example of what's great about john hiatt  it there's something about the john hiatt sound  it's really sh shrouded in classic americana  a real rootsy sort of some kind of southern rocking feel to it  but it also has a contemporary feel  i mean it's not old fashioned uhh music  and as always with hiatt i mean really the key here is  is the songwriting  the guy is just a great songwriter  in fact that's why he's probably better known for his songs which have been covered by everyone from bob dylan to bonnie raitt to   to even iggy pop  um and hiatt who's who's in his early forties writes about real life adult situations  which i mean may not sound that extraodinary but  but unfortunately enough is is a suprisingly rare thing in rock and roll where you have middle aged rockers like mick jagger who are still going on about chicks and cars as if they are still teenagers  hiatt writes about real people and people we can identify with  and he doesn't pretend that he he's  sixteen  i mean his specialty is writing about relationships  um especially relationships gone wrong  and as the title walk on implies this album really is full of references to wandering and hitting the road  and it really seemed to me in many ways to be a kind of mid-life crisis album  and actually a lot of long time john hiatt fans thought oh my god this is it   he's fallen back off the wagon cos he did have drinking problems and a lot of personal problems  but according to to the article in this morning's gazette local newspaper he says no this is just what he's writing about but he's still happily married which is good to hear  um musically it's just an incredibly rich album  it's produced by don smith who who's  produced records for the tragically hip and keith richards  and he's a real good match for hiatt because he specializes in down home rootsy uhh guitar rock and that's what john hiatt is all about  this is tonight at the spectrum  i assume with the kind of music he does he's probably pretty good in concert  oh he's great  i saw him the last time he played the spectrum and   and his records are great but i mean it's not a clich&eacute; to say that that i mean you gotta  got to see this guy live  this is the perfect place  and he really rocks rocks out in a big way live too  okay up next danielle martineau song   now wait a minute here  i was expecting cajun derivative music and some great accordion playing and there she is singin   well yeah actually and she you know   and to be brutally honest she's not the greatest singer in the world  i actually wanted to play that track cos i think it's a different side to danielle martineau  and to kind of give you the idea specially   especially on this album like she really is known for  for her zydeco cajun sound  and there are some there's a song called   zydeco musico which is sort of classic cajun  but i wanted to show that this album it really has a kind of variety of of musical sounds that i think might surprise some people who who think it's just only straight new orleans style stomp  but she is in town to play  presumably to get herself through an entire show she's  gotta got to reach into the cajun repertoire  oh no  absolutely  and again you know talking about the difference between uh uh you know the records and live  live of course that sort of cajun fiddle stomping  she's got this great fiddle player michael ball in her band  obviously they're going to pull that kind of stuff out  i think as the night goes on too right and that's obviously great party music uhm  she's also a very accomplished musician  she's a she's an accordion player and singer and she's really studied the accordion pretty seriously  she's gone down to louisiana and and   uh sort of played and studied under like sort of great zydeco players  but she does that bottine souriante  quebec folk band kind of thing  she sort of takes those traditions and injects some new stuff into them  particularly in this album there's i think there's actually a collaboration with some o   of the folks from the bottine souriante   and she brings what she does is she takes some of that traditional quebecois uh sound mixes that with cajun and also mixes it with uh almost rock and roll  i mean the first song on the album is a song called tealy  t&eacute;l&eacute;guid&eacute;s which is a kind of critique of the t v culture  and that's almost a an out and out rocker but then you have this sort of foot stomping traditional fiddle in   a lot of a a lot of songs  uhm part part of what's really good about it actually is martineau's very talented band which is a band called rockabayou  includes as i mentioned uhm michael ball on fiddle who's just really a a dynamite uh fiddle player  guitarist jason lange who's also very accomplished musician  and they all really come to life on stage  that's where it's really best to uh see these guys  i mean what's interesting is uhm you would think in a way mixing traditional quebecois folk music with traditional louisiana music would be an obvious uh concept there's so many uh similarities between those types of music   here's don goran now with traffic  yeah cos you don't wanna want to  be hit by a blimp  that can that can really hurt  laugh news   thanks very much don 
Canada	 campbell   i do  i've been trying to get kyle stravitski to take me out to the ball game without having to pay for a ticket but it hasn't worked  yeah i've tried to drop hints left and right but no kyle  doesn't listen so   laugh you poor underprivileged kid you   ooh   and he's on vacation this week so he's not even listening right now in all likelihood  right   yeah not quite   not the time to make your pitch   no no no i'll have to wait until he gets back  traffic report   and uh due to the francofolie this week uh i just wanna  want to remind people that sainte - catherine street uh downtown closed between st-urban and jean-mans  that's right in front of complexe desjardins until august the fifteenth  so uh go out there and maybe just uh  yeah that's right there's so many festivals  just avoid it the whole summer   we're almost used to that though  between the jazz festival and everything just write that block off    but no you should go down there and hang out at the festival cos it's a lot of fun   just take the metro that's all  yeah   yeah exactly  safer way to go  thank you very much campbell jeffrey   campbell will check in again later with traffic  as we mentioned kyle stravitski is away this week but we've got xavier roth who's got a look at sports right now   eighteen minutes now past seven o'clock on daybreak  jeanne taylor is still scribbling furiously  taking note  of what the editorials re-   laugh   editing  editing   oh editing there you go laugh   um what's on in the editorial pages today  well i thought i'd start with that piece in la presse  local newspaper by simon du mont who is  who talks about the ongoing conflict at the casino which is still closed and he sa says the   the headline is the casino la mauvaise cause  or the wrong cause   he says uh the conflict there is one of the most unpopular labour management disputes in recent memory  and that you don't have to be anti-union to be unsympathetic with the demands uh being made by the union there for a four day week  he says the four day week is a good idea in theory but not practical at the casino  uh the workers there want to work thirty eight hours over four days but they want forty hours' pay  and uh du mont says that uh if you're  gonna going to want if you want a shorter work week you have to take a cut in pay  there's no two ways about it he says  yeah it certainly looks in many ways as though they were profiting from the great success of the casino that they went on strike so early into it's life  it was an incredible boom  they had to uh enlarge the parking lot over there almost immediately cos it was so crowded  but anyway he says this is economic nonsense and it comes and this is money out of taxpayers' pockets  since tax is- since casino revenue goes into the  consolida- ah consolidated government funds just like tax revenues   so he says he hopes that uh this arbitration proceeding that has been commenced will uh will put an end to it  and that they will follow the examples of the charles levoie casino workers who've already signed an agreement  a more reasonable agreement according to du mont   also in la presse uhm the editorial cartoon today  the caption reads the hole in the ozone is getting bigger  and the answer which is written in smoke uh above  peoples' homes there's sort of smoke coming out of the chimneys says  we don't  care   so uh i we haven't heard too much about the ozone and the ongoing uh discussion about that and  this is uh the editorial 's  position  we haven't even heard about it   so interesting to mention that that   la presse decided to mention that  hmm   no i remember even last year there was great   great talk about the hole being over over uh our region and even in the spring and in this year uh you know word    yeah   in le devoir claude-pierre rossignol  talks about the necessity for a massive restructuring of the state apparatus in quebec  ah he says it's important that the public sector ah be completely ah reorganized  says in fact quebecers want and consume more consumer goods uh than ever before  that the standard of living really hasn't dropped despite layoffs and uh recessionary sort of glitches  he says the problem is that quebecers want more luxury goods  uh trips v c rs home computers   and they also pay more taxes  so ahm he says the problem is that there's these two dynamics at work  and we want and to go along with that we want   increased services from the state and we can't have all those things  so there has to be a major restructuring of the health and uh education uh st services   uhmmm   that's interesting  i mean it's that that sort of take on things that we haven't heard  we shouldn't be feeling so sorry for laugh ourselves   i guess laugh   it's true   and finally i just thought i'd leave you with a note from the globe and mail that says that uh thinking uses up fifteen calories per hour  just thinking  doing nothing else but thinking   well goodness me  aren't we just burning like mad here this morning then  laugh   laugh   thank you very much for your calorie burning exercise  this morning   talk to you later   that's jeanne taylor   it is just twenty-one minutes now past seven o'clock on daybreak  music   mmm  tossing frisbees around and laugh   oh yes  and uh good news in traffic too alana   things are working still uh very well in from the west island and southshore and laval  also from vaudreuil hudson three lanes open eastbound on the trans canada  and soon that construction will be over so just hold on cos that will soon be finished  also watch out for fog patches coming in from outlying areas  they are slowly burning off though  yeah it's looking a little hazy as again we've got our video picture of the city out there  yeah   well that should burn off to give us a sunny day  a high of thirty degrees  so another lovely day much like yesterday  and as promised another one tomorrow  so let's hope we can deliver on that  so far so good   kristeen ball 's our reporter in sweden where she watched yesterday's big race and she joins us live  and kristeen the fastest two men in the world this year are canadians  they are basking in the glory right now but i guess they don't have a lot of time to celebrate because bailey and surin will be taking part in another big race later this week  that's right  they've uh got their pictures on the front page of every swedish newspaper over here but already their thoughts are turning to the four by one hundred men's relay race  now the first round is going to be held on saturday but even before then uh team canada has to announce who is going to run alongside of bruny and donovan  it's a four man team  we can expect an announcement either later today or tomorrow  and it's going to be exciting especially xavier because  americans dennis mitchell and carl lewis are out of contention altogether with injuries  there was a possibility they could run  they were favoured to win the gold but with them out it looks like  maybe another gold medal for canada  and uh still with sprinting lynford christie who did not place at all in the men's one hundred metre yesterday he has a hamstring injury  he went down at the end of the men's one hundred metre and we're still waiting word on the severity of that injury  hmm  now canada of course is celebrating however graham hood of oakville ontario uh one of our top middle distance runners will not be taking part at this year's world's  no he's disappointed and the entire canadian team is disappointed because it was going to be sort of a a   two-pronged thrust for canada in the men's fifteen hundred with graham hood and kevin sullivan  but word this morning from england where graham has been recovering from a hamstring injury that he suffered in an eight hundred metre race in sheffield earlier it's just too severe  he's been working with physiotherapy and light workouts but he can't run the race that he would like to so he has withdrawn altogether  so it's just gonna going to be kevin sullivan to keep an eye out for later this week  and what's the situation with our our   decathlete michael smith  well i've got an update for you there xavier   after seven events michael of kenora has moved up now he's in fourth place with dan o'brien the very famous american decathlete still out in front with a sizeable lead in first place and right now they're just getting the pole vault competition underway  thanks kristeen   you're welcome  that's kristeen ball reporting live from the world track and field championships in sweden   so pretty by the cranberries  well it's hard to start thinking about wool sweaters and winter coats when you're wearing shorts and a t-shirt but it's almost that time of year again  the fall clothes are hitting the stores right about now  and we wanted to find out what to expect in the coming months so we sent daybreak's marie mcdonald out to check out all the new fall fashions and she joins me now in the studio  good morning marie   hi alana   hey  well i went out and visited angela buccarro montreal designer angela buccarro yesterday  i actually went to her her office up  in ah in saint leonard which is also her studio and her warehouse so as you can imagine it was it was oh yeah laugh yeah there was just bolts of of   you know colourful wools and chenille lying around and paper patterns on cutting tables and racks and racks of fall merchandise just waiting to be shipped out  all happening there   now i wanted to quiz her on what we'll be seeing in stores  but first i had to find out what we won't be seeing  you know the grunge look has been finished  i don't think people wanna want to look like that anymore  and you know it's it's so bizarre because for a time in fashion i mean i i did that thing too i mean i did the grunge look so i'm guilty also  but it's so funny because you know you can spend a lot of money and you look poor  but this season i think it's going more towards this hollywood glamour  this nineteen forties uh appeal like the green coat i showed you with the big shawl collar and the big pockets and the tabs on the pockets  a real man man's cashmere coat  that's a spin-off of nineteen forties where women look glamorous  well glamorous  from courtney love to joan crawford i guess in one year  now all that talk of glamour if that's back in and women are looking more like women uh how will that translate into what we'll see in the stores  i guess no more plaid no more baggy jeans no more scrappy sort of stuff  but what'll be replacing them  well we'll start with the colours for fall because we're going uh back to the basics it looks like  no more baby blues or baby pinks or whatever so much  didn't see much in the way of the metallics either that were popular for a while  i in terms of colour we're   gonna going to be seeing a lot of what angela bucarro calls the forest colours  so you can imagine that the the rich greens of the trees and the burgundies and the chocolate brown that either you look great in   earth tones exactly rust and of course lots of black  as always   earth tones   i was thinking i look like death in all of those   oh great   laugh you gotta  got to find one colour there's usually one colour that   or one one shade or so  that everybody looks good in  that you're safe with   yeah 
Canada	 but in fact it hasn't been done all that often besides ah danielle martineau  and i think she's doing something that's ah really quite unique  thanks very much samuel   thanks boyle   just to recap john hiatt performs at the spectrum tonight danielle martineau at caf&eacute; campus on friday and saturday   thanks very much matt   five minutes now before nine  it's been a long week for bob gay   laugh   i think he's starting today for the first time   starting to show the signs of strain   what are you talking about  you look a little tired   just a bit tired   i look tired   do i sound tired i hope not  no no   good   right now though let's talk about the newspapers again  with jenny goode   hi jenny   hi johnny   ryan welbeck in la presse quebec newspaper today writes about richard leille the uh former minister of restructuring who's ah been out of the cabinet since just after the referendum  and he says i mean there's this whole scandal now because there is uh a lot of questions  the quebec auditor says there had to be a further investigation into how contracts were handed out because they all seemed to have gone to richard leille's deputy minister a and then he handed them out to some other people he knew  well ryan welbeck in la presse says that  jacques parizeau the premier ah deliberately picked leille as minister of restructuring because he was incompetent and if the whole thing was a failure then leille could just be uhh the scapegoat for it and it could all be wrapped up and thrown away  uhh bill savage in le devoir quebec newspaper says well why don't we just wait for the results of this investigation that the auditor is proposing before we condemn anybody  uhh roderick wagner in la presse uhh also  wr writes about writes today in  la presse writes about the quebec auditor's report and he says uhh he's writing about the underground economy  uhh the auditor had said there's two point seven billion dollars worth of underground economy that's not being taxed  now that this is like a collective theft  that the people who are not paying those taxes are robbing from the people who do  because they're robbing from the system   mhm   they're not putting any money in  and he says uhh wagner says  look it isn't when you talk about underground black market economy you're not about uhh drugs and contraband cigarettes  you're talking about   laugh guys in sharp suits   laugh exactly   he says you're talking about legitimate activity construction  babysitting all this  it's just that it it isn't being taxed  so he says what you have to do is find a way to encourage the people to pay taxes but you don't want to squelch that activity because it is valuable within society  right   so he says that's the del delicate  balancing act you have to perform  cough   of course he doesn't laugh say how  how </}you can do it and it it's   not really easy to figure out  yeah   on the opinion page of le dev   le devoir la presse   sorry uhh is lucien bouchard's speech to uhh  yesterday which was i think to the chamber of commerce in laval  yeah that's right yeah   and is basically about uhh budget cutting and the financial responsibilities quebec is going to have to take  and what tack he's going to take as ahh premier if nobody challenges for him for the leadership  so if you want to look at what he said instead of just reading news reports that's in la presse   in the gazette local newspaper uhh the editorial board writes about this a crackdown needed on tax cheats  the same thing about this ah underground economy not being taxed  and says that cheating on taxes is very frustrating because it means the people who do pay taxes have to pay that much more for every time somebody else cheats  and this gets even more people frustrated and then they want to cheat  the gazette says look we've got new technology we've got computers that can allow us to check up on what people claim they are being paid and uh compare it with what they actually received and who paid them what  and we can also check on how much their house is worth  you know if they are living in a house that's worth ten times their annual salary something's up  le journal's quebec newspaper michael olderlay writes about lucien bouchard taking responsibility for ahh quebec's finances ahh and saying that he he will cut  he says it it's  refreshing to hear somebody not blaming the last  premier and saying well i can't do anything the budget's pretty much already determined  mhhm   yup   and also not blaming ottawa  just saying you know we we have to live with our own uhm sys system   situation   the globe and mail canadian newspaper this morning has an interesting story  remember jean chr&eacute;tien right after the referendum complaining that the he didn't like to go to sleep at night after listening to the french c b c's canadian broadcasting corporation coverage  saying that it was biased in favour of a yes side  well an outside consulting firm has examined the uhh french c b c referendum's coverage  arran research incorporate says that while the yes side did get more airtime on the french network that reflected the news developments of the campaign and there was no evidence of bias or misrepresentation in the coverage  so that's the globe on ahh apparently uhh quite fine coverage by radio canada during the referendum campaign  thanks very much jenny   jenny goode with the newspapers this morning here on daybreak   five minutes now before eight and here's john white   i'm still trying to get used to the colorado avalanche symbol next to patrick roy and mike keane's name  and i think roy is also gonna going to  try and get used to it a little bit  he said earlier this year when the uniforms first came out for the avalanche that he hated them  laugh   took a different feel uh yesterday when asked about it    laugh word   i said to bob this this morning   it would be funny to ah wear a new jersey in my first game in ah  and also uhh the first game on february the fifteen when  uh the fifth sorry i'll i don't know if i'm going to play but to be on the bench or if i'm on the ice ah seeing the montreal jersey on the other side and if ah   not be really concentrate in the game uh almost go on the wrong bench and ask some gatorade to pierre joval instead talk to my trainer  ah you know  it's it'll be something really uhh uh really new for me  i also heard him say that he was going to have to really concentrate  he figured the first time he played the canadiens   you know to remember those guys with the c on their jerseys  weren't weren't friends   exactly   that's what he was saying right there uh  they will play the avalanche uh february fifth and it will be at the montreal forum  the circus though has left town boyle   finally all these reporters who had never covered the  canadiens before who showed up uh  for the last few days of events   ugh   do i detect some resentment there laugh    laugh   no not at all   laugh   it's just i i it  i it   everybody in the control room is saying yes yes yes   laugh   laugh   that's not fair laugh   that's not true laugh   it's just that they're dividing around the country  it's still the same amount of people covering  it's just some people are going to colorado today for the avalanche's game against the edmonton oilers tonight  uh already la presse and le journal  and the gazette three quebec newspapers have writers going there  there'll be more people who go up to ottawa on saturday night  the avalanche will be just up the road in the nation's capital for that game  and then you know some people will be in pittsburgh where the  canadiens play tonight  and then back here uhh on saturday for a big party again  laugh   a reunion in fact when the canadiens  play the rangers  and you get to stay in montreal  i do   laugh   i absolutely do   laugh we're glad   relax we're we're happy to have you   here   yeah thank you  it would be nice to send to denver  we'd like to have that live report   laugh   sucking sound no   laugh   there's uh been serious economic fallout from all of this  we talked about the the money that the canadiens are saving from all this  but what about all the fans who spend so much money on buying number thirty-three jerseys with the red white and blue it  scripted broadcast talk   colorado avalanche colours  speaking for thousands of moms everywhere i'm sure  my son's abandoned them  really  boston  whew   he says boston  canadiens to boston  hey  blaspheme laugh   laugh no   thanks very much john   tape begins mid-sentence uh hm a long time ago with the alouettes but it just doesn't seem like its a big football town  well since the alouettes have left here in nineteeen eighty-six and they brought in the montreal machine and the world league of american football  that did well  but so has uh junior football in this province  they're starting to develop some good players  and all you have to do is look down to the united states and the university of michigan and tim biakabatuka  who played at vanier college and grew up in montreal even though he wasn't born here  so there are a lot of ah good developmental schools now in this area that though although have to send their better players to the united states where they have a better system for them to progress to the pros  but at least there's interest here now  thank's very much john   doug goren is here with traffic   tape starts mid-word bout  about those logbooks  it's it's really i find it quite astounding because those books the ones you have in front of you are fakes  they're there to fool the government  these aren't uh legal logbooks  these are doctored-up logbooks  wha what what do you mean  uh they've been uhm tampered with  well you've taken off hours  yeah  i've uh rearranged the logbooks so it looks uh legal when you go through uh weigh scales  why because you were driving more than ten hours in a row sometimes  yeah there's times that drive forty hours uh without any sleep  no stopping  no s no s no eight hours no four hours  nope laugh no there's no eight hours no four hours  its now twenty-six minutes past twelve o'clock  you're listening to radio noon  my name is mary henny   what do sign-making and chicken farming have in common  not all that much actually  unless you happen to live at tullochgorum farm  that is near ormstown in the chateauguay valley  radio noon's duane johnson visited the farm recently and he is here to tell us more about  hello duane   hello mar mary   what is the connection  laugh well i laugh   now if you tell me no connection at all   mary what a stupid question  you said it  laugh   laugh   the connection actually is is  suzette ann gaston   uh she and her husband jeff have been running a chicken farm near ormstown for several years  they call it tullochgorum farm becuase it is on tullochgorum road which is actually uh actually right next door to where john hershey lives  uhm which i found out only you know sort of round about   i approached it from a different direction  i didn't realize that although we have been to his place before  uhm well much as as suzette ann gaston loves chicken farming and her little chickens uh she wanted to branch out at a few years ago  to use her own fine arts training in something okay  she had been through concordia and lawrence co  college lawrence saint lawrence college   and well a few years ago she started making signs for people  farm signs uh store signs that kind of thing 
Canada	 it it and actually it's true though they're colours that really make you stop and go you know fall is here you know no more the   of the brighter colours  in terms of actual styles well there really isn't one style  fashion i mean i'm sure you've noticed this as well fashion's really changed   skirts aren't all you know one length everybody has the style that looks good on them  but there is one trend that we can look at uhm comfort  everybody wants to look good but if you're gonna   going to wear that outfit for twelve hours at work you also have to feel good and feel comfortable  you don't wanna want to be you know shifting the skirt and pulling the pants down and tucking the shirt in   so so loose and flowing were some of the words that were being used to describe this season  gee comfort what what a radical concept laugh   how bold laugh i'm i'm glad to hear that though that that the dictates are loosening up a bit  i mean it used to be that sort of uh skirts ankle length one week and then thigh high the next  so uh uh i'm i'm pleased certainly to hear that uh more variety's what's going on out there  that's there no one skirt length or one type of shoe  yeah and a lot of that has to do with with  women themselves saying you know stop  enough is enough  women who are looking and recognising what they do and they  more importantly do not look good in  and also women who wanna want to be comfortable in what they wear whether they're working or whether it's  it's you know for play on the weekend  in a sense fashion has become much more customer oriented and customer dictated than it was five or ten years ago  the fashion today is more uh geared to the consumer  she is very smart she knows exactly what she wants  and she's smart in the sense that she looks at her bod  speaker says 'bod' not 'body' and she says well i'm i'm  too short to wear very wide pants  so in my collection you'll see a series of wide pants and you'll see a series of narrower pants  and as far as lengths of skirt go you'll see both  you'll see very long at thirty-five inches and you'll see some short at twenty-one inches   i don't think you'll see much of the mini-micro   well we can all breathe a sigh of relief on that one  still what what's that talk of twenty-one inches  that sounds pretty micro to me  well it was funny cos i thought the same thing but it's  not as short as i thought  that actually falls to just barely above your knee  so it's it's quite respectable quite professional  now the other thing that's interesting is men's fashions continue to creep into women's wear  uhm you've probably got a few already  i mean very fast how many of your husband's or dad's sweaters or jackets have been hanging in your closet over the years  i tell you i'd be right back to grunge if i tried to wear my husband's sweat-   he's like six foot three six four so i'd i'd  be floating  it'd be like those pants you can fit three of your friends in  i'd look pretty ridiculous  well now you can go out and you can buy your own husband's clothing only you can call it a boyfriend   you can shop at the men's stores!   exactly  except you can actually buy men's clothing in the women's stores  oh hmmm  things like a boyfriend jacket a grandfather sweater which is one of those big baggy cardigans you know really nice and warm  homely   yes exactly but so nice in the winter when  it's cold   mm mmm   it's perfect for the woman with no man's closet to raid like  you and i  now every year we get the must-haves  those pieces of clothing that nobody should be without  you must have uhm a good blazer   okay if you're if you're working a lot in the office and things like that you should have at least one good semi-fitted blazer  you should have a good boxy blazer a boyfriend blazer for the weekends you know to wear with boots and stuff  you should have some really great sweaters  sweaters are good over jeans or good over leggings or good over several uhm types of pants you may have in your wardrobe so that's how you can mix that in  uhmm must-haves uh  some good bodysuits  one or two good bodysuits uh a good basic black one which is my colour  and uhm ah one of the colour of your choice  choice well that's good to hear after hearing you must have   laugh   i mean i think that that's a for people who don't have a whole lot of money or don't want to be ah told that they must have anything how much can you sort of recycle from year to year  i mean we are we safe going out  in in anything uhm that uh you know if you don't  wanna want to completely redo your wardrobe twice a year  uh can we sort of uhm carry on with what we've been wearing pretty  much or make it look a little different  well well yeah a lot of the things that  that angela buccarro was mentioning you know you must have a couple of sweaters well you can use last year's sweaters or the sweaters from a couple of years ago  jackets most of us have blazers of some sort lying in our closet or lying in a in a back closet somewhere so  you know it's it's not necessarily  necessary to go out and and completely rebuy things  uhm and and a lot of the designers like angela buccarro realize that that most of us you know we wanna want to buy a couple of new things  you know you wanna want to go into work in the fall with that one or two new items that make you feel great  but that doesn't mean going and buying a complete new laugh  wardrobe twice a year or three times a year or however many seasons we have  and especially for us with winter when we wear that  those clothing s here  yeah   so long   yeah well we don't have a three month winter it's seven months  laugh   well that's what i was gonna going to   say  this concept of like four different seasons in fashion doesn't work for me  i mean it's summer and then everything else  laugh exactly exactly welcome to montreal  welcome to quebec i guess  uhm no we we sort of talked a little bit angela and i about about how you can update your old wardrobe  because sometimes it's a case of taking old things and bringing them into the new  so she did have a few suggestions on how to make that old suit new again  supposing you have a black suit you know and you've always worn it with this particular shirt or or sweater  the idea is to go get a sweater that has some black in it  whether it's this stripe striped   example that's got some black charcoal and some white little uhm uhm hair sticking out or or fabric sticking out  that would be a good alternative  so find something to replace that  uhm and then try to to buy the colours that suit you best  and supposing you look really well or r look really good  in in uh black ah let's say different shades of greens and blues for example try to find the sweater that'll go  into your green  i mean it's nice to bring that sweater that you've got at home and go shopping and compare if the tones match   so the thing to do is maybe you might wanna want to add just some sweaters in this season  and that'll be your accessory instead of just a belt or  or just a pair of shoes  so go ge uh get some sweaters  keep your base pieces like maybe your pants or your blazer   maybe keep your blazer and replace your woven blazer  replace it with a knit pant and a knit sweater  well that's pretty down to earth advice  i must say that's that's pretty much how i function  i don't watch uh fashion that obsessively but you kinda  kind of can't resist going out and buying something new  to to not feel like you're wearing the same old thing all the time  maybe one little trendoid thing and then your staples and well you know your safe standards  those same suits that you've had for the past couple of years  yeah yeah   yeah   well that's good down to earth advice there  that was from montreal designer angela buccarro  she spoke with uh daybreak's marie mcdonald yesterday and uh marie's been in with us  thanks very much marie   you're welcome alana   our little fashion debrief laugh   it is now twenty-nine minutes past eight o'clock and uh in our final half hour here on daybreak we'll be looking at uhm plant therapy  it's seventeen minutes after uh six o'clock and uh oh  we're gonna going to get sued  it's time for the purse laugh uh first press review of this morning and and   sa sally sa  salvy is wincing  everybody's suing everybody this morning  there's the an andre arthur story  there is the uhm uh what the scientology church going on and uh there's there's a ruckus in c&ocircumflex;te-saint-luc as well with the mayor  well yes   it's a morning for lawsuits  boy i'll tell ya you   but the big one i think that everyone's gonna   going to be talking about this morning is lucien bouchard's uh  lawsuit   yes   it's a one point four million dollar lawsuit against andre arthur of and radio madure   he's the uh sort of well-known radio host known for  for shooting from the hip that's a that's for shooting from the hip all the time  he's from c k v l here in montreal yeah   uhm the uh suits say that uh statements made by arthur had invaded uh the privacy of bouchard and his wife caused moral damages and ruined their vacation uh uhm   and ruined their vacation   and ruined their vacation a-   uh according to the suit arthur uh said that uh audrey best had left bouchard and uh came back to him just before his leg was amputated for the sake of appearances and uh and for bouchard's reputation   on top of it all ruined their vacation   arthur uh apparently also said that bouchard was in a relationship with co corinne cote levesque the widow of rene levesque  now the exact wording of all this is in la presse   local newspaper you get sort of a paraphrase of it in   in uh the gazette this morning   yeah it's in all the papers right  that's right   i saw it in journal de montreal  and the gazette as well  arthur made this statement apparently three times at the end of june  and uh bouchard and best say that clears throat they've never considered separation and the suggestion of a liaison with uh cote levesque is false  in la presse arthur is quoted as saying that he has no regrets about what he said  and that in fact it was good radio   and uh   well that's always the ultimate thing for andre arthur right  and he's been sued before  this is old stuff for him  that's right  although one point four million dollars i think  is   i   as a lot of cash   he's he's t   sitting up and taking notice of this  uh he said in fact that he was just quoting frank magazine when he said this  uh that this story first appeared in frank and uh well frank   is ah well-known well-known to english canadians as  a kinda kind of a scandal sheet that comes out of ottawa  yeah   and he also said he'd like to see bouchard try and sue frank because sue frank is notoriously difficult for people to sue  that's right it reincorporates itself and so forth  yeah yeah   every month so it has uh a sort of a technique for getting away from this  the the big news in le devoir  local newspaper today is that the quebec government is getting ready to recognize same-sex couples  uhm it has apparently uh the government has   revived an interministerial committee that was looking into this for the liberals 
Canada	 it's now nine minutes to one o'clock  you're listening to radio noon  my name is denise storey   it is fourteen degrees in a wet montreal right now  now we have the business panel and uh you can guess of course what has still dominated the business news news everywhere really still and that's the r word  may niven is a reporter with the globe and mail's report on business  wayne lewis is a business columnist with the montreal gazette  hello to both of you  hi   we survived it laugh somehow laugh   hi laugh   do you spit though   like like lucien bouchard's little boys do spit  referendum spoken like a growl   yeah laugh   spitting noises   laugh how has business reacted to this just a astounding week   well   it's it's funny uh you know  some of the things that happen in business are so short-term that  they're they're funny  uhm on tuesday morning the tse toronto stock exchange just shot up into the stratosphere  uhm the dollar went way up  the bank rate fell and prime rate fell too  the last two things are pretty darn good for consumers  but this by no means was as we know a definitive vote and business is still absolutely uhm paralyzed by what to do by this  and in many senses they are literally paralyzed  uhm we we talked about matrox before the electronics company in the west island  it was going to shelve an expansion plan altogether if the yes side won  the no side won but it's not going fully ahead with that expansion plan  it it doesn't know how much of it it will do but it certainly knows it's going to farm out some of its r and d activities to uh florida where they all have they already have a small presence  there's just uncertainty right left and centre  especially in light of parizeau's resignation and uh lucien bouchard's uh contemplation over his fate  matrox is a very good example of what is going on in the small and medium size business community  you have to make a sort of distinction because if you speak to economists about what's going to happen to the economy as a whole uh they tend to believe uh whichever way their sympathies lie that uh the economy will get back on a on an even keel pretty fast  a very large part of quebec's industry uh is made up for example of resource industries and it's very very difficult to pick up a vein of gold and move it out of quebec  uhm so things like that   heavy laugh   things like yeah very heavy  things like that won't won't be very much affected uh and they probably wouldn't be too severely affected even if quebec were indeed to go ahead and separate some day  but the growth in quebec's economy and the new jobs in quebec's economy come from the small and medium size business sector which include a lot of high tech businesses and a lot of service businesses  so matrox is a good example of those businesses uh and other very large uh uh business the apparel business which depends uh on ontario and the rest of canada for eighty or ninety percent of its sales  and businesses like that aren't ready to pack up their bags and leave  although at least a few of them are doing that  there's a company called milton funwear we may have mentioned before that that they've had it with the  uncertainty and even with the no they said they were moving  uhm yes   uhm hmm   there are other businesses that are just saying well you know we're going to go ahead  we're going to stay here but we're going to be very cautious and we're going to put what investment we can outside quebec because we want to hedge our bets  so i think that i think that  we've we've shot ourselves in the foot and we're going to suffer a ser a long term and serious   loss of job creation   and it's it's not just uhm investors with hard assets factories and so on  uhm we've got money managers that are really important   an important part of the canadian and the quebec economy these uhm managers who uh have a lot of investors from from   overseas and so on  they're not sure what to do about canadian equities  they're very doubtful about quebec equities  we saw morgan stanley being very very skittish on uh canadian equities  and uh a lot of fund managers are simply not sure about what to do  so we've got that aspect and a lot of uhm foreign investors hold canadian and quebec debt so that has lots of implications  all of these factors that we're talking about have a lot of implications for for quebec's books its public finances which are in a very messy state  uhm the deficit was five point seven billion for nineteen ninety-four ninety-five  it's anybody's guess as to whether targets for this fiscal year can be met  especially with   the possibility of taxpayers leaving and companies leaving  but that that's a huge question   well i'll i'll  give you my bet  my bet would be very strongly that they will not be met  uh quebec blew its uh its projections last year by a billion dollars or something  i'd be sure that they are going to blow their projections this year uh by maybe not that much but by a very large amount  uh ontario has already had to make massive additional cuts on top of the initial harris cuts because they were running hundreds of millions  of of dollars behind on their revenues because the economy's been slow  how much slower has it been in quebec  i'd like to  i would like to move on get put the referendum behind us cos i mean the truth is   i would like to but i can't   wouldn't we all laugh   oh really laugh   we want to talk about it endlessly forever and ever   we're not obsessed  let's talk about the the phone companies  they're they're mad  they're mad yeah laugh   ma bell is mad   one company is laugh   mad as hell and not going to take it anymore laugh    you don't want to make ma bell mad i guess laugh    mad as bell laugh   oh oh laugh   good one laugh   but what's the story  well the local the c r t c said that local phone rates are allowed to rise by four dollars a month over the next two years  that's two dollars each year  and then there's going to be some sort of unknown increase as of january nineteen ninety-eight  january first nineteen ninety-eight  and long distance rates would fall by an equiv   equivalent amount for most uh most consumers  uh what bell is is upset about is that  it it's still going to be regulated in the long distance market  and it says well why shouldn't competition simply prevail  why do we have to go to the c r t c and get our rates approved and go through lengthy hearings and so on   it thinks that there's just an unfair advantage especially by big american companies  it feels very threatened by the on  onslaught of a t and t and so on and some of the big heavyweights south of the border  uhm  they're still making money hand over fist aren't they  oh yeah laugh   they're they're making money hand over fist if you look at the total number of dollars that they're making  if you look at the total numbers of dollars they're making in relation to the amount of investment they have in their company i don't think that their profits are that impressive  uh and that's what they always like to look at  but you know when your making a billion dollars a year or  or something like that it's very difficult to uh to get a sympathetic hearing for that kind of a complaint  uhm  there is another aspect to this which is that uh what the c r t c is aiming at in the long run uh almost everybody uh who knows the industry and and has studied it believes is probably a good thing  it's competition both in the long distance field and in the local field  uh it's kind of   but is there any competition in the local field   absolutely none right now but there are cable companies that have wires to almost everyone's home  it would not be inconceivable for them to start up a parallel phone system  and indeed they've done that in some places like in the united kingdom  in fact uh videotron uh runs one of those competitve phone services   right in the u k yeah   i i would love to see competition because i would love to be able to fire my local cable company  and maybe i'd fire bell too if they couldn't offer competitive uh uh phone rates  maybe i'd just switch around  but the government the federal government has said it is committed to competition in all of these different areas of telecommunications cable and telephones and so on  so uh maybe we're seeing it uh put its money where its mouth is  uhm  what's the unemployment rate  we have figures word   yeah the unemployment rate has done one of   its the kind of contradictory things it does sometimes  the news looks bad because it went up by two-tenths of a percentage point uh in canada and i think three-tenths of a percentage point in quebec  the news really is good strangely enough  what happened was a whole bunch of people entered the labour force in october thinking that they were going to get jobs  many of them did but many of them didn't  so the unemployment rate goes up because there are more people looking but not finding  in fact the number of employed people went up by nineteen thousand across the country  and that's   that's especially significant that that happened in october of all months uh out of all years  which of course the referendum was making everybody uncertain  so the fact that people did feel positive enough about jobs being out there is is rather interesting  the big picture is that we had nearly a year of no employment creation from late nineteen ninety-four until late nineteen ninety-five  now we've had three months in a row of employment creation  that's good news  next hour on the phone-in we're going to get even further away from the referendum  we're taking you to a desert island   wow whoa   laugh can i come please  yes you can laugh   it's outside of canada   we're all invited   come on  everyone's doing it  what three books would you take with you to the desert island  that's easy  any three books by patrick o'brien who's a brilliant british uh historical novelist whose name does not uh influence my uh my choice  uh and they'd be particularly appropriate for a desert island because these are sea-faring historical novels uh based on the british navy  uhm i i'm a big fan of  bonfire of the vanities   i love that book  i could read it again and again  and i'll give a plug for a couple of   you'll take three copies of bonfire of the vanities   no i'll give a plug to two other uh actually local writers  one is uh carole corbeil  she wrote voice over a very interesting account of english and french montreal  the two current sort of crossing  a very good book  and the third one is by actually a friend of mine  her name is diana atkinson and she's just been nominated for a governor general's award  it's called highways and dance halls uhm   tales of a stripper and more   a lot more to that ook  it's a very complex very well-written book  terrific   that's great  thank you both of you  we'll see you next friday  thanks  that's may niven and wayne lewis   they are uh the radio noon business panel  may is a reporter with the globe and mail's report on business  wayne lewis is a business columnist with the montreal gazette  and next hour we want to know what three books you would take to a desert island  right now we have the time signal  at the beginning of the long dash following ten seconds of silence it will be one o'clock 
Canada	 uh the story says that uhm part of i  that this is in fact part of the p q's political party  programme to extend uh to gay couples pension benefits insurance benefits and other things that are now available to heterosexual couples  and the ministe according to the story the minister of justice paul b&eacute;gin is really in favour of this and kind of pushing the idea   but his boss uh premier parizeau has never been very keen on it  according to the article  and in fact during the election uh the p q he said that the p q would not go faster than society wants to go on this issue which a statement which didn't really uh gain him any favour in the gay community  uhm so uh some of the commentators though in quoted in le devoir today say that it would probably be very profitable for the p q to try and regain the support of  the the gay community though now just o   on the eve of the referendum   and the gazette local newspaper is continuing its investigation into truck safety  their uh top story uh   big front page story yeah   is today is that uh the uh uhm i it say   says it says that uh uhm a union official uhm is saying that uh truck safety inspectors who work for the uh  soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'assurance de l'automobile  quebec's transport safety authority are being pressured by their bosses  to skewer uh statistics to make the roads look safeter  safer than in fact they really are  uhm the inspectors' union says that its uh members are told to do random mechanical checks of the trucks and to avoid singling out trucks that appear to be unsafe  and uh the gazette spoke to a soci&eacute;t&eacute;  official about this and he actually seemed to confirm that in fact that is what they want  they want random checks  they don't want their inspectors looking for  for uh trucks with problems  mmm   union basically saying that the roads are a lot less safe than  w than we think even we think they are right even less safe   then and then the fact the   st the statistics reflect that they are  yeah  the uh the the reason that the uh soci&eacute;t&eacute; does this at least according to uh uh what they say seems to be a concern to get statistics that get random r  a random sample and to get accurate statistics rather than to get unsafe trucks off the road  hmm  does that make sense  yeah and it sounds as if there's a mixed message there  it certainly does  yeah  or mixed priorities anyway   mixed priorities yeah   page three of la presse is almost completely devoted to problems at city hall today  at the uh top of the page is a story uh saying that just when the city wants to lay off employees it's had to hire seven hundred temporary blue collar workers this summer  and this is because apparently thirty percent of its permanent blue collar workers are on vacation in the summer  but the problem is the summer is the busiest time of the year for them because that's when the roads are fixed and the   the parks are are maintained and uh  flowers are watered and so on  uhm at the other other times of the year in fact montreal ha is uh has blue collar workers with s uh with not enough to   do   to do   according to the story   hmm and timing is everything  that's right  uhm the city wants to change this with in   its new contract with the blue collars but of course uh they've been in mediation recently but that mediation apparently has broken off for the summer  so it there won't be any   quick laugh there won't be any quick  resolutions to that  problem   laugh   there's a lot of irony on thr  page three of la presse this morning  that's right  the other kind of ironic story is that well you know how some people in in some neighbourhoods in montreal they've started getting their garbage picked up every day  mm-hmm  well y on page three in la presse uh  it's quite a picture isn't it  that's quite a picture  there's a story about a daycare centre in c&ocircumflex;te-des-nieges that had to wait two and a half weeks to have its garbage collected  uh the daycare did a big clean-up and put out some old tyres and bro a broken dishwasher and wooden cases and things like that on uh third of july   there are old records in here   are there  there's some old seventy-eights at the front  well apparently some people were going through it because it was out there for two and a half weeks and people were going through it and really uh culling some of the best stuff   boy i'll tell ya you   venetian blinds they got it all  heh you shoulda should've  gone down there laugh   laugh garage sale  but and when they did this it got spread all over the place so it really made a big mess  mm hmmm   uhm this was that they had put this out for the the big you know the big collection that the city does um just after moving day but nobody came  and it wasn't until yesterday that they came but of course   it came they came a half an hour after the daycare had contacted la presse about the story  so i wonder if there was a coi   coincidence if that's laugh  was a coincidence there  cos you said timing is everything  laugh   and the strange thing is that the city doesn't seem to have an explanation for that  the the person they spoke to says well well maybe it was a we we had a lack of staff  he he wasn't too sure what the reason was  but he was on vacation so he couldn't talk  laugh maybe that was it  maybe it maybe it's tied in with the blue collars  i'm sorry i'm just leaving the office     okay we'll talk to you in an hour  thanks a lot sally salvy with the press review on daybreak  but sally salvy is here as she is every morning at this time with a look at what's in the papers  are you managing to get any sleep these days  i know a lot of people are having trouble with this   this hot weather that it's so hot and sticky that they can't fall asleep and when they do they just keep getting up every couple of hours  it's hard it's true   yeah   but uh i s i actually do a fair amount of sleeping in the daytime so   oh so that's the bonus yeah   well maybe laugh   do do the kids sleep okay   i never really word   they have a they've  w well i have fans kind of pointing at them and they seem to be alright  we and when it gets really hot then we  move to the basement or a deep breath or e  even down to our living room  so uh  if you have a basement or an air conditioner you're lucky this summer  yes definitely  and apparently air conditioners well for a while there they were pretty hard to come by  i don't know if that's that's uh gotten any better  but uh there there's really a run on them in the stores  lots of news in the papers this morning  well yes and uh the big news today is of course marijuana  the marijuana story is back in the papers and the focus in the french press is that nobody wants to do anything about it  the story is that uh up to a million plants are being cultivated on crown land in kanesatake that was the story that broke yesterday  today le journal de montr&eacute;al 's local french language newspaper front page says the authorities wash their hands   and the headline in ah la presse is that the ball is being passed back and forth between ottawa and quebec city and that certainly seems to be what's happening  the federal government says kanesatake is not a reserve it's a community in quebec and therefore comes under the jurisdiction of the  securit&eacute; du qu&eacute;bec quebec provincial police force  but meanwhile premier parizeau is saying that the pot is growing on crown land and so it's a federal responsibility  the grand chief terry cloutier says that the r c m p  royal canadian mounted police should deal with it because he doesn't want the s q coming into the area  and uh he said that he only found out about the m   that marijuana was growing in kanesatake on monday night through the media but there's a lot of scepticism about laugh this  uhm and in fact on the front page of la presse  there's a picture uhm in which uh the man in charge of security for uh  the the uh the band joseph ouellet is pointing to a field where he said he burned twenty thousand marijuana plants on the first of july so this can't be the first time that the  the band council has heard about it  by the way we'll be speaking with ouellet in the last half hour of the programme this morning  probably speaker said 'probambly' about uh ten minutes before nine o'clock  i know that's a long way away for most of you but if you are near the radio you wanna want to hear more about this story and uh directly from him this guy in charge of peacekeeping then  we'll we will be talking with him at the end of the programme  intake of breath   there are also reports that family members of joseph ouellet are in fact behind the marijuana growing operation so that's a story that's not going to go away pretty word    the the one thing that we haven't heard yet and i'm sure we will some columnist is going to bring this up is that uh they you know they  wouldn't be growing this if people weren't smoking it  you know that  and uh this would be just another weed if uh there wasn't that factor involved  laugh   so although people are pointing fingers at the different parties so far the one party that hasn't been pointed at is those people in the public that smoke the stuff and uh  that'll come up though  trust me   yes   i'm sure all the angles will be explored  la presse uh has a story today saying that uh a company called canadian life is now offering to buy the insurance policies of aids patients  this is a phenomenon that's existed for some time in the states  but it's new here and there was an amendment to the civil code in quebec to allow this to happen uh so now this company is here doing this  and what they do is they pay an aids patient fifty-five to sixty-five percent of the value of their life insurance policy  canadian life then takes over the premiums they pay the premiums and then they collect the the benefits when the person dies  the paper says that a montreal doctor who works with aids patients has agreed to help the company  and this doctor whose name they don't give in the article says that a lot of aids patients have no money and uhm no family and that this could help them live their final years uh in more comfort  but the paper also quotes a law professor at the university of montreal who says that he has an ethical problem with this  ignace gosselin says that it's it's   sort of like betting on the death of the sick  so he didn't word   yeah i you know   th that's the thing they uh   fr from what i can gather from the story and from what i've seen in the states is that uh the people who are involved in the business end of this are selling it on its practical merits  ah however uhm when you examine the ethical uh problem here as the  university from montreal uhm university of montreal   professor uh comments that uh th there   are some s some uh serious questions that are raised by this and uh i know a lot of people are uncomfortable with this  well another problem with it is that they only pay fifty-five to sixty-five percent so there there is a big profit to be made by this they they   get quite a big cut out of the insurance policy  and uh yes there there are a lot of questions   that's right second overlap occurs over extracorpus text

Canada	 in fact it was one of her very first signs uhh that i noticed driving down the road in towards ormstown  there's a beautiful sign for uhm brysonwood farms  with a big holstein cow on it  a beautiful green sign with a coloured cow under the name  just a really nice almost looked like a logo   uhm in fact i asked the owners  i drove in and spoke to them and incidentally said where  where did you get that beautiful sign  they they told me about suzanne and tut suzette  sorry and led me to her home  now she's set up in the basement of the old family farm  it's it's full of stone walls quite warm and cosy but it's filled with all sorts of modern woodcutting painting equipment  all sorts of things  well you you've described  the the one uh the one outside of the uh the   the holstein farm  but what types of signs does she make  well you've probably seen this sort of thing  uh pointe-claire village for instance is full of them  many of which are actually suzette's   but you've seen them other elsewhere in say ski towns up north in stowe perhaps in vermont  the typical nice wooden sign  they're textured signs  very colourfully painted  and there's lettering on them of course  but they've also got animals or scenes or something or other that make kind of a picture or a logo  uhm but i spoke to suzette ann gaston in her basement workshop  so why don't i let her explain a little bit more about what she does  probably a lot of what uhh people are seeing now is ah sandblasted signs  uh the sandblasted signs are made from california redwood or  sometimes western red cedar  uhm the reason for that being they're very durable outside and they have a very pronounced grain pattern so when they are actually sandblasted  the uh the wood grain shows up and it  h it gives it a very unique warm look uhh that people seem to go for  and then finished with uh ah i do a lot of fine art renderings of well we do a lot of farm signs cows and and special paintings that people order  we cut out the pattern on th the  on the sign   uhm peel away the parts that we want sandblasted and then uh uh blast away and that wears the uhm soft sapwood down leaving the uh  the growth rings standing out  and that's what gives you the uh the  pronounced grain patterns  and it leaves the letters and whatever details uh we have standing out from the background of the sign  a lot of your signs very three dimensional and   and imaginative with flowers and bees and animals in uh odd places  you're very artistic  well thank you  uhm we always try to add some sort of pictorial element that uh draws people's eyes at something special  it just sets uh our signs apart from from the rest and we really try to work at that  but it's a whole field of study  uh the design the uh the colours the artwork it's just uh it's like a a   puzzle that i'm continuously working at and uh trying to come up with uh new and better designs and uh it's just uh a whole world of fun  well some villages like stowe for instance i think they've passed bylaws where everybody's sign has to be a a  wooden sign  that certainly benefits s some  businesses like yours  oh yeah i think that's a terrific idea  laugh   i think everyone should do that  uhm  is that sort of thing happening in quebec  uh yes  in fact i have quite a lot of work in pointe-claire village  uh they have a a non-illuminated sign bylaw there  uhm which gives i if you've ever been to the village it just gives a really nice warm village-type feeling  to uh to a shopping area  how do you sell your product  well that's a tricky one  i it's very difficult to   adverti advertise end of tape   credible incredible  tape starts mid word amount of work just from that  it's the signs when people see them they know that's what they want but   i see farms   i mean i passed one on the road uh brysonwood  that's what caught my eye  that's right   i went in and asked who made that sign  well that's great  that's one of my very first signs  and they're they're good friends and good neighbours and uh we did a business card design to to  ah match their's  they advertise in the the holstein journal and they have an an ad that matches   their uh their sign  so it's getting the farmers in to uh thinking about this a little bit more  a lot of people are are selling their uhm genetics more and ah and travelling abroad and this just gets them uhm a little extra cach&eacute;e i think  a little image  that's right  precisely  i should be starting uhm a farm sign for a an  apple farmer in rockburn pretty soon  a a nice sandblasted sign  i'm looking forward to doing that one  those are really my favourites  and uh we're working on some glass right now  we're doing a little decorative glasswork for the new clubhouse at the ormstown curling club  and uh just that kind of stuff that i i  really enjoy  it's a bit quiet right now but uh that's normal for this time of year  so what sort of equipment do you have here in your own home  you you work out of your basement  that's right  this is my big shop here  uhm i have a lot of hand tools uh s small  power tools  as you can see i'm limited as to space  we work with uh jigsaws and uh and that sort of thing  uhm i have a lot of chisels and and carving tools  it looks like if you get busy you're going to have to expand from the basment  uh yeah that's we have uh kind of tentative plans to uh convert the shed on our house to ah to more more  shop space and build on a little bit   but right now it's nice to run it  it's cosy down here  uh sometimes it gets a little bit full  uh my mom works for me part time so when the two   what does she do   uh she coats out panels  she cuts things out  uh really everything short of designing and doing the fine art things  uh and uh we have a lot of fun together so  now this is a business going on on the side of a  chicken farm  is laugh   that's right laugh   i always say laugh   laugh which one takes precedent   laugh   laugh i tell people that uhm my husband is president in charge of the chickens and i'm vice-president  and i'm president in charge of the signs and he's vice-president  so uh he helps me when he can and uh i uh help him out when  i can  we just have a a new batch of chickens in there now so i spent most of the morning in the barn and now i'm  back at my desk uh doing design work  so uh i i started this as a uhm as a way to do something with my my  art here from the farm and it's really uhm   it's really succeeded uhm amazingly well in   in a short time  did you marry into chicken farming  laugh uh yes in fact  i've i just grew up down the road here and i used to work on a farm as a uhm as a student   i worked for for my uncle and drove  ah combines and tractors and that sort of thing  and then i started going out with the guy i met on the school bus  and uh well here we are  uh we're partners on the farm and uh and partners  in the sign business too  so it's really uh the best of both worlds as far as i'm concerned  hmh who is that again  it's suzette ann gaston   yeah that's right that's right  laugh i ask the questions  i give the answers laugh   you're kind of  superfluous   laugh   laugh i'm that's  tullochgoram signs   tullochgoram signs   word i'm gonna  going to say   who are you anyway laugh   laugh   she must have a sign out front of her   oh a beautiful one yes  uhm one of her best pieces i think with a nice little scene on it  no chickens just a nice sign laugh   that's nice actually it's not  it's not a clich&eacute;   oh she does she's got   kit kitchen full of small signs   as of as a showroom  you know people come into her home and there's all this wonderful  examples   but what do they cost  well uh she does plain plywood ones which can be as  as little as a hundred and fifty dollars or   or so for just for your  h home's name or your own name  sort of a little sign hanging outside y  your property  if you want one of the sandblasted ones in the   in the redwood they cost anywhere from two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars on up  i mean if you're going for a big big sign then of course it's quite a bit more  hmh   cos she tells me redwood's about uhm oh a thousand feet of it costs her five thousand dollars five thousand dollars for for redwood so    hmh   hmh   duane thank you  okay  it's radio noon  duane johnson theme music   stick with us here at radio noon  next on the program we have the farm panel theme music   it's now twenty-one minutes to one o'clock and it's time for our farm panel  bob hebert is a sheep and beef producer in danville  that's in the eastern townships  hi bob   hi mary   genie nuberg is a dairy producer in rawden  that's in the lanaudi&egrave;re region  hi genie   hello  and hugh maynard is the executive director of the quebec  farmers' association  hi there hugh    you're on the phone because you are at the national dairy uhh conference going on in in toronto  wha what's happening    that's right  duane mentioned that  do you have one of her signs    laugh     oh you don't have a name yet    we could have a radio noon contest  name that farm    laugh stuart will do that    are there issues being discussed that that  would be of specific interest and and  importance to genie     remind us again about where the government is on b s t  bovine somatropin our government    hmh    genie are there any particular issues that  that you would want discussed or brought up at this sort of meeting  well yes and no  i mean all management issues are always probably  what is gonna going to to be the most interest in in the future    mind you we're still wondering bout  about b s t  and uhm at our milk meeting we asked about it and uh their  seeming was well if it comes it comes but we're not we don't really want it   and i think there's more and more people speaking out against it now  hmh hmh  that's about you know i think management cos that's what's going to save us in uh this this   that race of ours     is is quebec politics still one of the uh issues that is discussed in the corridors    laugh well so far bob we've   we've talked b s t so let's bring let's bring in   let's bring in in earnest the referendum  we'll talk about something else that's laugh also unpopular  the p q parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois is once again demanding that that quebec opt out of uh national agricultural program  no its u p a lunion des producteurs agricoles  that's doing that  the u p a  yeah  hmm    now now    it seems that way  i refuse to touch that one    but the u p a is is doing that  is that is that something that the government is likely to do  bob   well uh mister piteraine is uh uh asking them to uh to stay out of some of these programs  at least uh to give the administration to the provincial government but hand over the money in order to do this but uh i don't know  i don't think that's very surprising  they they've always sort of been in uh  you know of that policy a at   the at the u p a  and uh one must remember that they have a huge influence over provincial agricultural budget but they have much less over the federal one  and uh you know very well that unions don't run on ethanol  they run on power  and uh and that's what this is isn't it   laugh   laugh   laugh   boy are we in a rotten mood today guy  no no laugh 
Canada	 it's an affront to democracy to tell quebecers they have the right to throw the constitution of canada into the garbage   it's an affront to democracy to tell canadians they have no say in the borders of their own country   and it's an affront to democracy to think that a separatist elite has the right to deprive twenty-seven million canadians of their right to stability  it's also an affront to democracy to think that the cree and the inuit can be moved like cattle from one jurisdiction to another against their will  lucien bouchard has also suggested that canada is a prison  first he said canada's not a real country   now he said canada is a prison   twenty-seven million canadians think canada is the greatest country in the world  and if lucien bouchard and his followers think that canada is a prison they can form their own ethno-centric state but they can't kidnap three-and-a-half million people to go aga   along with them against their will  because separatists are not the only ones to have the right to self-determination  cos i can guarantee you that at least three-and-a-half million quebecers would much rather live in the prison of canada than the quebec-style democracy of lucien bouchard and pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;  uh what should we be discussing this hour  should pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; uh resign  is his report an affront to democracy  next hour i'll be asking you if canada's a prison  that was the main headline this morning in the journal de montr&eacute;al   and in the third hour we'll look at daniel johnson and the quebec liberals  uh will they agree with separatists that quebec has the right to use a referendum victory to trash the canadian constitution  we know that jean charest is uh siding with the separatists that the federal government should not have intervened  we'll see were the quebec liberals stand  the number to call is seven nine oh oh nine nine one  star eight two five five for bell mobility subscribers  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d  and this hour our topic pierre f his report  is it an affront to democracy and do you believe that he should resign  uh we'll go to uh our first caller  let's go to sydney   good afternoon  you're on c j a d  good afternoon  how're you doing  fine how are you  laugh i don't know how i am living where i am  uhm i just wanted to touch base with you  first of all i'm glad you're still talking about this fraud thing cos i think it's it's probably more important right now than even the uh the hebert court case  i find it incredible that pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report stopped where it did  or that he stopped where where it did  to answer your question i don't think he will resign  but i do think that we as a population and uh we've got to stir up  our our politicians to get them digging further into this thing  and i i think if we if we keep digging we'll pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; will probably wind up being fired if not charged  i think we shouldn't give up on it  i heard uh thomas mulcair the m n a member of the national assembly for chomedey who fought this brave fight from the beginning  he's not giving up on it  he's upset with uh pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s conclusions  i'm upset by it  i think many people are upset by it  this is absurd  i mean tell this to anyone  again the same thing applies as uh applies to everything else in quebec  try telling this to somebody outside this province or outside this country  twenty-two thousand twenty-two thousand boxes untouched  out of twenty-two thousand-three-hundred   it's an absurdity  laugh i know it's   it's incredible  i watched last night i watched le point and uh pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; was interviewed  i don't know if you saw it or heard of it  but he again restated which i guess had said earlier   uh that the unity rally was more an affront to quebec's democracy than than the electoral fraud  okay i'm glad you brought that up  i want to get to the uh  i want to get to the unity rally  and we'll do that and we'll also be back with more of your calls after we hear from kenny mulder with c j a d skywatch traffic   we are back  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d  we're talking about pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; and whether or not he should uh resign  he thinks uh he's very upset about uh about   people coming to uh montreal for the canada day rally  he's not that upset about out and out voter fraud and stealing of ballots but when it comes to this rally he's quite upset and he feels that uh companies and individuals uh outside quebec were involved in last fall's unity rally  now this is gone to to lengths that are truly ab absurd   in this country we have freedom of speech  we have freedom of assembly  we have freedom to travel  but there is such a state of delusion in quebec that the electoral officer feels that before people can decide whether they will travel to quebec during referendum they have to have daniel johnson approve their expenses  i'm not making this up  this is what what is happening  it is outrageous  now a lot of the people of course refuse to even talk to his   investig investigators cos they have uh no uh right to do that  most uh legal experts agree that quebec can't possibly make its referendum law stick against transactions that took place beyond uh the borders of uh quebec  the sale of a ticket or the the rental of a bus  i mean there is freedom of assembly  people have the right to come to quebec  quebec is still part of canada  they can travel here and march here and put up a a banner and do what they want  to suggest that they have to have these expenses approved by the head of the no committee while they ignore all the work the unions did  it's it's there's only one word for it and that word is absurd   let's go back to the phones  norman   good afternoon  you're on c j a d  good afternoon uh timmy   uh i know you're a master of words and a great debater  and uhm i not often agree with what you say but in general uhm i appreciate the way you defend your cause  you are not an analyst  you are a militant but that's alright with me  but i think this time you are pushing really too too far  and i think that uh mister uh what's his name laugh   mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;   mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;   and as judge uh goldbloom are both people of great competence and great integrity  wait wait a second  it's  first of all it's judge gold and the thing is in terms of the integrity  so as far as you're concerned looking at two-hundred-and-ninety is enough right  two-hundred-and-ninety boxes and leaving the and finding some fraud but nonetheless ignoring the twenty-two-thousand other boxes that's okay  okay let's put the thing in context  okay  they are twenty-thousand boxes okay  twenty-thousand-three-hundred-and-something  now on each boxes there was a representative of the no and a representative of the yes committee  that's right  and when there was a conflict the yes committee was the one that had the final decision  yes but   okay   a no member had a recourse  and as i know the militancy of the federalists i know  if why are we looking at twenty-nine boxes  because they complained there were irregularities there  and since then they have you have been trying everywhere to find if there were not any other places where there were  irregularities and they nobody came in with any one   well well norman norman ho  hold it hold it   norman you and i had this same conversation uh or a similar conversation yesterday  uh you have your theory i have you have   yes you cut me off during the same topic   yes you have your theory  i have mine  but i mean it certainly would have been easy to check a few more boxes to look into a few more ridings than just to look at three ridings very carefully  and the other issue uh over here norman that's very important  you're talking about how militant the federalists are  i'm telling you that uh for the no scrutineers   uh   excuse me let me finish  for the no scrutineers in lac saint jean it would have been pretty difficult for them to throw a big fuss because their neighbours and friends and relatives are all yes supporters  they didn't want to make a big issue out of it  so they may have let no votes been thrown out  what's wrong  listen   that's proof that's a tangent   so why don't you prove me wrong  i mean it's a there's a very easy way to prove that i'm wrong and that's by looking into the boxes   well if that's that's   and you know what  if they look into the other boxes and they find that there is no evidence of voter fraud in the other twenty-two thousand  they don't have to look into twenty-two thousand  let them look at another five hundred or a thousand and they find no evidence i will publicly apologize if they do that  thank you for calling  let's go to our next uh caller  we go to uh adam </@  good afternoon  you're on c j a d  hi timmy   uhm one of the things that i found rather bizarre  i mean it's a it's a serious issue but i mean it's sort of got asp twilight zone aspects  to it  when uhm pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; says that there's absolutely no evidence of a of a national conspiracy  well of course no one is actually talking about a national conspiracy  the worry is that there is a provincial conspiracy   conspiracy   no i i noticed that  that we use that that   even uh judge gold used the word uh national  conspiracy   yeah   yes i know  i don't think anyone in saskatoon was involved  no  right  and the other thing  i mean unless they're talking about the conspiracy to sell plane tickets  but what also strikes me as strange is fir   first of all they're they're   it looks like they were desperate to find something to  to take the attention away from what would normally be worrisome in a democracy like tampering with votes  uh they suppressed uhm free speech  i mean it's a matter of of public record that federalists like guy bertrand keith henderson and steven scott brent tyler wanted to actually argue publicly as a  as a political argument the issue of the rule of law  and for three of the four weeks they were suppressed by law   by from uh exercising that democratic right  right now   well i think that's why it's a very good idea that robert libman is taking this to uh the supreme court  the whole referendum law is unfair  these are rules made by separatists to make it uh convenient as possible and the other nationalist party doesn't like to do much to contradict them because they want to get these soft nationalist votes  and in the meanwhile all of the people of uh canada have to uh suffer  thank you for calling  we'll be back with more calls after we take this break  commercial advertisements   good afternoon  we're back  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d and our my previous caller norman  mentioned that i'm uh not really a political analyst but i'm a militant  well first of all i analyze politics uh for a living  but should i pretend that i don't care there's a difference whether this country's broken apart or not  should i tell you that i think living in a separate quebec is the same as living in canada  of course i'm not going to say anything as preposterous  i feel very proud to be canadian  i am proud to be a federalist  i'm not ashamed of it and i will not pretend to be neutral on the issue 
Canada	 i'm roger bolton and this hour we're talking about the quebec referendum law  should the law be changed instead of splitting everyone into a no committee and a yes committee  uh we're talking about this in the light of some of the charges by the director general of elections pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; to many people who participated in that canadian unity rally last october uh that uh he considered to be more a serious violation of democracy than the widespread voter fraud  now it's my pleasure to bring in to the studio julius grey who's a constitutional lawyer  and he's a professor of law at mcgill university  julius a pleasure to have you here  oh it's always a pleasure to be here  now julius uhm i spoke of uh earlier the fact that we've challenged the referendum law  beginning of nineteen-ninety-two you represented me when i was the head of the equality party at the time  uh calling this a violation of freedom of expression  the fact that we're forced to participate in one of these two committees  and we can only spend money if approved by one of these two committees  uh the supreme court recently agreed to hear the case  maybe you can outline for our listeners the two competing arguments with respect to quebec's referendum law  we lost the case in the superior court and two   two to one in the court of appeal  so there are two types of judgments  one favourable to us by mister justice bourassa  and one unfavourable uh by justices speaker uses french pronunciation bisson delisle and michaud  but all of the judges all favourable and unfavourable agreed there was a violation of the charter  the uh only question is uh whether this violation of freedom of expression and perhaps even freedom of association is justifiable in a free and democratic society  and there are several positions possible  the extreme position accepted by american courts including the supreme court of the united states is that you can't put spending limits at all  i don't think that would wash in canada  i think spending limits are a reasonable thing  and uh in quebec there are elaborate ways to make sure that there are spending limits  uh for instance only individuals can contribute to any campaign and only up to a certain maximum  whether it's an election or whether it's a referendum  under those conditions then why is it necessary to restrain speech and not let you speak out  given that there is already a a maximum and that there is no way uh corporate and uh union uh dues can be used  what is the reason  and that is what it turns on  whether the prohibition of all expression uh that uh outside the two umbrella committees is a reasonable limitation  i would add too uh what is uh you can't do for instance is tr  i find quite shocking you can't campaign for an abstention  you can't campaign against the question  you couldn't publish a book of essays some of which are for and  some of which are against   okay but let's   but let's stick to the specifics here  let's use the example of uh this past referendum  if one of the groups  if some type of group such as the equality party in this past referendum wanted official status in the no committee to bring up certain arguments and daniel johnson did not want to permit them a platform to bring up so some of those arguments he is perfectly within his right based on the referendum law to block them from holding a rally or distributing material   yes he could be   he can lose with before that committee  that judicial committee but that's for a small amount  and if he acts reasonably uh there's nothing you can do  let me give you an example  suppose some extremist english group had said we want people to vote yes because we want partition now  now can you imagine mister parizeau's and mister bouchard's predicament having to fund people who are coming to say exactly the opposite  but it's no more legitimate  but they're still trying to exact the same answer from the population  a yes vote   they're trying to extract yes   but but of course it can have a counter it can be counter productive   imagine somebody for instance saying technically i'm for the yes or for the no but for such ridiculous reasons that everybody understands that it's really word   but shouldn't they at least have the right to freedom of expression to express that opinion   absolutely absolutely  that's what i'm saying  on the one hand you shouldn't force uh parizeau and bouchard to spend their money on them  but on the other hand it's totally illegitimate in a democracy to prevent somebody from having his his say  so the best solution is to allow groups outside the umbrella committee to speak independently as long as the money is raised uh in the within the limits  so the government's primary argument is that this is the only feasible method of keeping spending under control for a referendum campaign  well that too is of course uh uh highly disputable  there are other countries which have limits on how much you can spend  but no country  there is  we could not find a law as draconian as this in trying to control the type of spending and by whom  uh it's clear i think that uh you could think of a law which is perfectly effective and which doesn't go as far as this one  which is of course one of the leading arguments under the charter  if you're going to violate the charter you have to show that this violation is the minimal one necessary to achieve an important end  and i think you're going to have a hard time with that  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to be part of the program  we're discussing quebec's referendum law  we're gonna going to the phones right now and cam you've been standing by  welcome  cam are you there  have we lost cam peter and  let's try then edward   edward you're on the air  welcome  yes  hi  i have a couple of points to bring up  you know uh don't forget biking is a is a   healthy thing  you know it gives people the opportunity to get together  joseph do you have a comment about the referendum law  we know we've heard you on this program many times  you've actually used other names than edward   so uh what's your comment about the referendum law  so so what do you mean  do i have to use  what i have to use  do i have to give you my mother's name too  laugh what is your comment on the referendum law  ed   don't be so miserable  the people will want to go go out with their bikes one one day a week  okay ed did you have to uh  no but listen  you know that the the sovereignists they want to go to to the united nations for us to be able to look uh at what's going on the next uh uh referendum  did you know that  well for uh do you agree that the probe should be a lot deeper into the alleged uh rejection of no votes  no i think that the united nations should be there the next time so that you don't have any uh false feedbacks  i agree with you   and don't forget that the germans you know in the last war they thought that they would win by propaganda throughout with the radio  it it didn't succeed  the nazis didn't win uh with it  so don't think that you're gonna going to   you know by giving word   you're not gonna going to win nothing  sigh ed i don't understand what you're talking about ed   okay ed we'll see ya you   i think that's not a bad suggestion getting the united nations   to uh to help monitor the next referendum campaign   to make sure   you don't think that's going a bit far word  laugh   uhm  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to talk about the quebec referendum law  what are your thoughts  do you believe that the existing law should stay in force with all expenses uh being declared under either the no or the yes umbrella  do you believe there should be spending limits on referendum campaigns  what are your thoughts  what are your thoughts about the probe by pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; about voter fraud  my first guest uh on line is john forest   he is the president of the algonquin college student association  mister forest thank you very much for being with us tonight  not a problem  not a problem at all  mister forest describe for us uh your heinous crime which has led to uh your being charged by quebec's director general of elections  heinous crime laugh   uhm what actually we've done is we've gone to uhm uh the major extreme of renting two buses two voyageur buses to bring students down to montreal where you are uh to stand for their country  crazy crime isn't it  uhm hum  laugh   did you spend the money in ontario or did you spend it in quebec  in ontario  and did the people who actually spent the money go into quebec  uh did the people actually i'm sorry  did anybody actually spend money in quebec to get on the buses   oh yeah   no but on the buses  oh on the buses  uh on the way to quebec or in quebec  no for the buses  did anybody charter buses in quebec  oh i'm not sure  well no but you you didn't  oh we we rented buses in  ottawa   because you see what i'm getting at is that it seems to me on principles of constitutional law that quebec provincial laws in canada are strictly territorial  you can't charge anybody with anything that happened outside the  province   so that's why i'm i'm puzzled by these accusations  right   so that's one important point  let me ask you uh john how did this come about  how did the director general of elections investigate  did they come to see you  did they interview people that were on the bus  how did this charge come about  they came to see us actually in the beginning  uh they sent the uh i guess the the  quebec elections police to come and see us  uh from there they contacted voyageur bus where voyageur uh told uh or i guess surrendered documents stating who actually had rented buses from them that day to attend the rally  so that's how they went about it  now what uh could the consequence of this charge be eventually  was that uh described to you  no it hasn't actually come to us  basically what happens is we got a fine for two hundred and sixty-six dollars stating that we had violated the quebec elections act and uh asking us to pay within thirty days  and you plan do you plan to pay that fine  no no  we're going to plead not guilty to the uh to the  charges and take it from there  and this is in quebec court that you've been charged  yeah   now what  did you raise issues with the director general of elections or you just received this notice from them and you haven't had a chance to question the charge at all  yeah we haven't really questioned it  what i've done actually is sent the the  charge on in paper to my lawyer  uh our lawyer is actually investigating what  exactly what you've just talked about  so they're going to check into everything find out if there's jurisdiction et cetera et cetera  now did you expect this at all when you rented those buses or your rented the bus or your intention at the time was just let's go to montreal  let's plead for canadian unity and that's it  did you ever imagine that this would come about  no not never  never not at all  we never   i mean basically all that ran through everybody's mind 
Canada	 we are back  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d  seven nine oh oh nine nine one the number to call  my guest right now is thomas j mulcair the chomedy m n a member of the national assembly   welcome to the show  thanks a lot mister shoemaker   first of all congratulations for fighting the brave fight from the beginning uh when you saw what was going on in uh your riding  now are you satisfied with the results of uh pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report  well like anybody who'd been following this since day one tommy  i i was satisfied to see thirty-one prosecutions taken against people who had vote you know organized a vote fraud   we all knew that it had taken place  and it was predictable that the prosecutions would have to come  what was stupefying however was to hear pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; go on to say that having your fundamental democratic right your right to vote stolen from you was not an attack on democracy  but attending a unity rally was  i mean that was mind boggling and there there's  no logical way to defend that position other than the fact that it was dictated to him by the p q parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois   now in terms of what was dictated to him by the p q  he looked at two-hundred and ninety boxes  is it correct he left twenty-two thousand untouched even though even though he found all of this evidence in the two-ninety that he did look at  laugh you you've   got that exactly right   let's do something for everybody  let's be there with everybody else  well that's one of the questions that could be asked for instance as far as the referendum law is concerned  it's not illegitimate for pe for people  outside a country to want to express their views about what's going to happen  in elections in the referenda or and  outside of province it's even more obvious because people in the rest of the country have a direct interest  how are they to do it if the only way to spend money is through two umbrella groups in quebec  yep  did you at all think of contacting one of the no side to get approval for coming into montreal to participate in this event  no  not at all  i mean like when they when it was brought up we had people from like  for instance we're a community college so uh we're normally in tight contacts with our community with mps members of parliament et cetera  uh the community reached out to us  they said come on  let's get down there  let's let's give a hand  and we did  we didn't even think about  it was just something that we wanted to do  we felt was right to do  and we did it  okay john   thank you very much for being with us and keep up the fight  thank you very much sir  pleasure   take care   bye bye  bye  john forest is the president of the algonquin college student association in ottawa  they were charged for renting a bus and participating in the canadian unity rally  and julius this uhm this is what  really is is the core of the matter here  should they uh be able to express their freedom of expression or because of the way the referendum law is structured there are certain impositions on that  and i guess this is a clear example to use   this you see i think freedom of expression  the supreme court has said it over and over again is particularly important  in political matters and artistic matters  it exists you know  you've we've seen that even commercial issues and so on there is freedom of expression  but when it comes to politics and artistic expression they're absolutely sacred  and here you've got a situation where all sorts of points of view may be kept out altogether  and i'll give you the list  this type of view from outside the province  satirical views mixed views uh hesitating views  i mean nobody uh the yes or no committee won't pay for people   to to say maybe one way maybe the other  it's un clears throat   it's unfair in my view  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to be part of the program  or star eight two five five if you're in your car  we're talking about the referendum law pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report  and we'll be back right after news on the half hour with  marilyn talbot   that law of course has led to pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; bringing charges against many people who participated in the canadian unity rally last october twenty-seventh  and also the outcry over pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report of the past couple of weeks of course was because he said that that violation of quebec's referendum law where people spending money to come to montreal for that rally was more a black spot on democracy than the allegations of widespread voter fraud  the rejection of no votes in ridings with high concentrations of no voters  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call or star eight two five five  and julius just before we go to the lines again i want to ask you  about that comment by c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; where he says that uh this violation of quebec's uh referendum law is more a black mark on democracy than these allegations of voter fraud  is did he mean what he said  was he just na&iuml;ve  did he is he just so sort of in this bureaucratic mindset that he is so involved absorbed with applying the law that he just didn't realize what he was saying  yeah but while we have thought that uh one violation was  if that were the case one was more important than the other  i found it incredible that remark  i find it equally i found it equally  incredible that some other commentators  there was a devoir le devoir is a montreal newspaper  editorial afterwards which supported him on that point  the uh what i would say is this  the additional spending uh is controversial  it's before the courts  the supreme court gave  there was a split decision on the court of appeal  supreme court gave leave  obviously it's something that can be debated one way or another  but if there is anything more fundamental in a voting system in a democratic system than fair counting i don't know what it is  i mean that is really a subversion of everything  and in this particular case you realize how close it was  another fifty thousand or sixty thousand the result might have been different  and then we would have been in for a real uh uh see-saw with uh first a a yes victory declared then taken away  i mean it would have created uhm scars that would never  would have taken twenty years to heal  uh i cannot see how not applying a controversial and legally uh doubtful although arguable provision can be more serious than the most fundamental uh violation with respect to counting and  and uh equality in that way  well what uh what i think is the most troubling is the fact that the yes side the sovereignist side which never leaves a stone unturned in these things did not ask for a recount in such a close vote  and that to me is perhaps an indication that there was some knowledge at the top that vote tampering took place and therefore they didn't want that to be brought forward   there would have been another argument that they didn't want for instance to being the government they didn't want to create a sort of uh uh tension that would have resulted from  you know you could have many explanations of it  the fact is they didn't act ask for a recount  and we don't know why they didn't  or perhaps they felt that fifty thousand was enough  again that there wasn't going to be a change and that it was simply going to prolong the agony  so i wouldn't draw that conclusion  but i still find mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s statement completely incompatible with basic principles of election  how about uh judge former justice alan b gold  wha where has he been in this  when i heard that he was to head up this investigation i felt that this would be a fair and thorough investigation yet we haven't heard from him  at all   well this   he made a report   he is not there to to give press conference  he made a report  the report found what was uh done  he wasn't to editorialize  the editorializing was done by mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; and i fear that it was wrong  uh the former chief justice did exactly what his function was which was to produce a report and to make it perfectly objective clear and step aside  now these charges that are being laid against many of these companies that boarded buses or came or spent money for the unity rally uh last october  if the case before the supreme court gets a favourable judgment  if we win this case before the supreme court that those sections of quebec's referendum law are unconstitutional will these charges be erased  these charges against these companies  well uh there's a very chance that the chances   the charges from the last referendum law if it's declared to be invalid uh will end lead to acquittals  that doesn't mean that the government will not be able to amend the law for the future cough in order to provide some sort of controls  presumably lesser controls than these  the supreme court will certainly not say i don't think there's a free for all  they're going to say this particular legislation went to far  so you're going to have to repai repair  your legislation  so i think chances are very high if we win that the present charges would fail  but there would be a new law in place for any future referendum  how would they change the law specifically  do you think they would allow other committees uh greater access into the uh ability to participate in the referendum  more freely   they would allow people   they would say everybody has the three thousand dollar spending limit  every individual  only individuals right  yeah  and you can spend the money either within or without the  outside these committees  but that already exists right now in present referendums  only individuals can contribute up to three thousand  dollars   that's right   they still feel that if they did open it up to other committees they there would be a proliferation of these small groups that would spend uh up to a certain amount and no one can control the number of those groups that are created   but but those people would still have to be limited to that same amount of money  which otherwise they could donate to the yes or no group and spend it  remember the law does not provide for equal funds for each committee  the government gives about about uhm i think it was three million dollars or something to each group and that wouldn't change  the yes and the no would each get a certain amount of money  and then the rest of the mac of the   up to i think an additional equal amount has to be raised  so it's perfectly possible that one of the groups will raise twice as much as the other and will have somewhat more money  and here we're not going outside the spending limits  we're simply allowing each individual to spend his maximum contribution  i must point out to you there'll be very few people who will give three thousand dollars  uhm hmm  uh to spend it up in any way he wants  i think the the protection is sufficient you see  i uh i find the government's fears that in the space of six weeks or five weeks it will be a million committees financed by by some mysterious forces from  probably from outside is bordering on paranoia  in order to  that was of course the explanation from both governments  since the early seventies   well so they feel that big business   big business might come in and control the result  but business cannot do it  they cannot do it because they can't contribute   it can only be individuals that's right   it can only be individuals  so its not a p q thing or a  because the p q and the liberals both gave this explanation  but i think this explanation would only hold water if they tried a looser law and it didn't work 
Canada	" but actually uh he was uh what i saw   of of his quotation was mainly regarding safety nets which uh are applied in other provinces but here uh are applied in the form of uh of our crop insurance and our stabilization  cos our programs and their programs don't exactly fit together  so they're gonna going to   how do you say always a a difference there    and i think that's probably why the reason is and they figured it'd be just easy if they gave the the budget over and they'd do what they want  are they right  well the way the the producers seem to want here  they obviously they sound like they're right  are they right in the long run that's for us to see  response and explination of political problem   then why would we bother to have a national milk program  and you know the it's not very coherent  actually  agreement and continual political commentary   and farmers have done a pretty good job at that we must admit  but when are we gonna going to get an answer to this  this seems like this was a question that comes up every month or so  historical analysis of political problem   hmh  historical analysis of political problem   yeah but just remember it may may  be unequal in one program but then in another uh you may get more  exactly   so uh in the end uh i i think it smooths out pretty pretty evenly  hunting season has begun  bob what's it like around your farm in the middle of hunting season  well i i took a run downtown this morning and i counted five deer decorating various vehicles just on the way down there  so we're really in the middle of deer hunting  but you know deer hunting has really changed eh over the past uh very few years  ehm you know it's it's it's a  it's a little bit like golf eh eh  you know executives try to work off their pots at playing golf and then they came out with golf carts  and uh then people mowed their lawn and this was good exercise and then they came out with these little tractors they sit on and  and there went the exercise  and now hunters uh have these little tree huts and uh they just sit in those all day and uh they just sit in those all day and uh uh wait for the deer to come out  and even worse than that there were a whole bunch of people along our roads here that sell deer apples  and uh these are apples tha that  uh you know in not very good apples in bulk  and they put these out to attract the deer  and get them to come close to their cabins  there  and uh as soon as the deer comes close to eat his apples they shoot it  and that's what hunting is  but but there's a big advantage to that  it it's taken away a lot of the hunter traffic from the farms actually  you don't see all these people going around  phrase   oh i guess   that's right  now they they're sitting in one tree static   they sitting yes  and you know where they are  you just stay away from that tree  so there's an advantage to it  but it's not much it's not much of a sport i don't think  personally uh uh it looks pretty wimpy  how bout about you genie   well it's pretty quiet around here  we have our club which has been very effective uh for us  and patrollers do go out and we we   try and keep the hunters at at you see we do have hunters on our property but they're ones that go through the club and if you are not part of the club well then you're just not welcome  and uh since we have been working that way and   we've had quite peaceful time and uh   but but your hunters actually move  do they  pardon   your hunters actually move  they they don't just sit   oh no no why bob is quite right  you see these silly little plastic things in trees and they've got seats to sit on that are made out of materials that keeps their you-know-what warm and uh  oh no there ah there isn't necessarily the uh exise exercise to it anymore  i'm i'm quite agreeable with uh  with bob   they must look like these giant caterpillar cocoon things up in the trees sitting up there  well they're a they're a tree rest i guess you'd call em them   but uh i don't see the point of it either  but that's beside the point  how bout about you stew   huh the biggest dislocation uh from hunting season so far is uh the fact that they keep stealing my gazette local newspaper  laugh   uh uhm  who steals your gazette  uhm word months ago through this program  laugh   well now we know what they're doing up there in their little tree houses  laugh   they're reading  they're they're reading stew's  gazette laugh   laughs and responds to joke   laugh   laugh   laugh   it's not funny   you're that's why you're so angry  ya you got it right on  laugh   yeah   oh my word   i hear there's pregnancy testing happening laugh on your farm bob   yeah well that's the time of year for pregnancy testing   you'd be amazed what i hear around here   laugh   laugh   it's the time of year for testing  that's the time of year because they've been running with the bull not "" bulls"" uh since the spring and uh and uh  when you bring your cows in you sort of want to know which ones   are are pregnant and which ones are not  and in the case of the ones that aren't very good  if they're not pregnant you ah you just ship them for meat  now you're talking about beef cattle of course  we're talking about beef cattle  yes i'm sorry i should have specified that  i did  yeah  we did a bunch of yearlings  uh last saturday it was such a gorgeous day and we just uh  i think we had about twenty of them  and what we do we do them ourselves and  uh it uh it's a rectal examination  you just put your hand down in there and if the cow bites your fingers you know there's a calf inside  ughh that's not true  well almost  is it  yup  and laugh those that we're not sure of like you know   if if we can't feel the calf we'll just put them aside for the vet and have the vet go over  it might mean a a sterility problem or something like that  puff laugh   which we'd like to know about  genie we'd heard a story on our news a good story a good news story about a couple of s q uhm  s&circumflex;ret&eacute; quebec qubec police service  constables who were driving around and they smelt smoke in  in your area  yeah   at roden  yes they actually saved the people uhh from burning  uhm   which is always uh is always great news and uh you know everyone's so happy that they were just  happened be at the right place at the right time  but and we're very lucky to uh to have these police out ah doing their patrolling  and uh it shows that they do a good job eh  yeah that's right  they woke the people up broke into the house   woke them up  it was a uhm man woman and a teenage son  that's right  mhm   and uhm   was this out in the country genie   yes it is  yeah fire is a terrible thing out there eh  oh it fire's a terrible thing anywhere and ah i guess it well like i said just so lucky that those police were patrolling that area at that time  mhm   and uh did smell something  yeah   all of you thank you for being with us  we'll talk to you next uh tuesday    kay okay take care  bye  bye bye   bye   been speaking to our farm panel of genie neveue   she's a dairy producer in roden  that's in the lanaudi&egrave;re region   bob hebert is a beef and sheep producer in danville  in the eastern townships  and stew maynard is the executive director of the quebec  farmers' association   now from montreal free-for-all on the source a m eight hundred c j a d  free-for-all with tim smith alan rinaldi  eliza green and george fraser discussing something in the news  uh yesterday was such a hot uh day in all of the politics with the guy bertrand thing and the emergency cab  cabinet well emergency chuckle chuckle cabinet meeting    and uh laugh emergency but mister landry didn't bother to stay for it  and when it was all over they announced that what they've decided is nothing anyway  uh there was the cabinet meeting there was the report by mister c&circumflex;t&eacute;  there was the going back and forth between mister bouchard and mister chr&eacute;tein  and tim suggested this morning he said  you know who's maybe not looking so bad in all of this is daniel johnson  remember him  he was premier of quebec at one time for seven or eight months  and he's the leader of the opposition and he was the leader of the no forces in the referendum  we   i should explain that as far as m  many of the english community are concerned he's not nearly vociferous enough  not nearly hardline enough   laugh no kidding   but as far as mainstream is mainstream   quebec is concerned he's ideally positioned  he's right smack-dab in the middle of this thing  uh the mad majority of  que quebecers and so is john charest uh the majority of quebecers don't believe that ottawa or any other part of canada should have any say in quebec's uh constitutional future  uh as as well the majority of quebecers don't like guy bertrand and think he's a buffoon a clown    i'm not speaking for mims myself   now i'm just telling you how the french speaking  mainstream are thinking   i i understand you   we we heard your disclaimer    uh which is why i wou   would which is why i'm sensing  picking up signals that daniel johnson alone of all the politicians in this thing seems to be steering a a  cautious and central course  well uhm i have trouble with someone who steals a cautious and central course in this one and it seems to me quite apart from being in tune with the mainstream of opinion which sometimes is good and sometimes is not uh that johnson has has taken what looks to me like a very troublesome line in most of this  and there's two issues that come to mind  one of them is the whole case of fraud in in   the referendum where johnson has left all of the leadership to a very very junior backbencher who who's done a good job  but i have to ask why the leader of the no committee hasn't been active on this issue inhale   you're talking about tom mulcair  yeah  and and the other one that   that bothers me very much is he is simply fitting into the mainstream by adopting the the separatist line  and and he's indicated he's prepared to consider a unanimous resolution a affirming   quebec's position  and i find for him to be taking a separatist line might be in touch with mainstream opinion but it doesn't strike me as making him a very effective leader of the federalists  it's my guess that uh mainstream separatist  mainstream quebec opinion is mainstream french press  uh am i right in your analysis   french media   french media   french media   i was watching lapine last night  on la pointe   okay   okay   just let me uh just let me finish    okay   i was just watching t v a as well   yeah   so that now i don't figure that most of the media is mainstream uh the way quebecers think  uh i think daniel johnson has been just the opposite  i don't think he's been playing this very well at all  i think he's been trying to pull a bourassa  and that's falling down on both sides of the fence  and the only thing you get when you sit on the fence is splinters  he has to come down on one side or the other  he's afraid to alienate the nationalist vote  he's afraid to say he's a diehard federalist even though i  i believe i know that to be true  he's afraid to uhh put off this one  he's afraid to put off that one  he comes out sounding like a separatist on one hand because uh ottawa has no business in quebec's future  and on the other hand  i mean he's on the one hand on the other hand  i feel like i'm watching fiddler on the roof  i'd rather watch somebody who's a strong leader with whom i disagree but at least i know where i stand than daniel johnson   who who i i believe has not been taking a strong stand "
Canada	" you're going back to to uh rights are rights are rights again  and uh we uh don't need that  well we're seeing a repeat of uh ah uhm party discipline because none of the west island west end m n as  member of the national assembly are willing to talk aout this  that's the first thing that's very interesting  even people like russel copman and russ williams and so on are uh not going to stray from the party line  they're going to hue to the straight and narrow on this one cos daniel johnson wants it so  uh and let's not forget that alan rock himself and uh   just before the last referendum called it a mere technicality uh that quebec might or might not have the right to decide its own future   i mean the federal government itself supported this in the last one  and you'll also remember well this wou   would well this time around john charest is on side with daniel johnson   john charest no less than the leader of the part   progressive conservative party one of the most outspoken advocates of federalism in the last referendum campaign is saying that the federal government is off base on this one  so daniel johnson's got some pretty strong uh got some pretty strong support from people that i trust  he's got some pretty bad support in the courts because you know it seems to me that what they are saying is it doesn't matter what the law says we're going to go ahead and break the law if necessary  we are above the law   and that's one hell of a dangerous thing for any people who are political leaders to do  s see i don't   i don't believe that  i i believe uh  absolutely believe that if any province not just quebec if any province were to have a straight question and a a  real majority of the people made it clear that they want out i believe that you have to do it constitutionally  but i believe it would be done  i i believe that if british columbia were to say the hell with it we're we're a pacific nation and we don't care about canada or the other side of the rockies we want out of here i believe that if it was clear question and a clear majority that the constitution would be amended to let them do it  perhaps it would but the question is and the cos   cos bouchard has consistently said we have that right now under the law   we can declare u d i unilaterally declare independence and that's the question  and and i don't think they have that right and i can't imagine a court will say they have that right  quite true if you have a large majority on a clear question yes you certainly have to deal with it  but to say that you're going to do it without regard for the law is quite another matter  well you're right about that and the interesting thing is  that it's really not clear what has priority in this province  i did a show on this yesterday and found that there were law professors who fell down on the side of oh wha we're a constitutional country and the constitution above all versus the people who fell on the other side who said well the constitution yes but self-determination yes and the united nations recognizes a people's right to self-determination  even the experts don't agree what is paramounts in this country  we may think it's the constitution but   not everybody says so   well so   so all the more reason why you get an answer  and it seems to me to ask the court what its view is an eminently sensible thing to do  and i cannot imagine why ottawa would be forbidden to take part in a case which asks the court that question  the old story eh an expert is somebody who's more than fifty miles from home  yeah laugh yes  by by the way on   on the others to come back to to   john dan to daniel johnson  again what troubles me is that when we talk about lucien uh  laugh not lucien when we talk about daniel johnson's leadership  the word is leadership and to simply go where the crowd is does not indicate that you are a leader  now i'll agree with you on that   well we wa yeah but hang on   we want him to be vociferous and screaming about rights and supporting the federal government and all of this we forget that he in has to take the long view on this thing  and his advisors are telling him daniel take the long view on this one because you could yet win a provincial election against lucien bouchard   well then you you  have to take graham's point of view  leadership not what his what his advisors are telling him  well yeah but this is only remember we think that this is the end of the world   we think that this is one of the great moments in uh duh ehm deciding moments uh beeping starts on the tape and continues to end of speaker's turn defining moments   in canadian history  uh life will go on after whatever the court rules  maybe so but it's still a defining moment  no no i disagree  daniel johnson is he playing it right  is any politician playing it ri right  tape fades out   commercial and then intro music   okay let's fill up those lines here  they're not all full  we have a couple available at seven nine two three four five one   we're talking about uh the political situation over the last uh what since last thursday or friday i guess  uh it's been hot and heavy uh and there not "" there's""  been some question about who's doing it right and who's doing it wrong  uh jean chr&eacute;tien uh ehm and mario dumont we haven't heard from him have we daniel johnson the premier bernard landry  uh who's done it right and who's done it wrong and how are you feeling at this point about daniel johnson  uh do you feel he is properly holding up his end uh of this uh debate this conversation  do you feel that he's uh put himself in a spot or do you feel that he's uh doing things uh right and properly  seven nine two three four five one to get in on the conversation  hello jeff   yes uhem hi george british speaker continues point   well i think obviously those are problems that would have to be uh settled eventually you no doubt about that   but i think that uh mister bertrand's basic uh concept is that   under in in the nineteen eighty referendum rene levesque was saying i want permission to talk to the voters about going our own way and if as and when we work out a deal uh we'll have a vote again to accept the deal okay  that was quite different than this time when mister parizeau was saying we are going to vote on independence for quebec we are then going to make an offer to canada after a yes vote and if we don't have a deal with canada within one year tough luck we're on our own  now that's that's quite different  and that's what bertrand says is illegal that the constitution  doesn't call for that doesn't allow for that   response   nor am i nor am i  response laugh   yes i did see it   you have to admit that new cartoonist in la presse  who has replaced gerard is is pretty good actually  laugh   but he's obviously a very confirmed separatist  discussion   lysiane gagnon   discussion   yeah louise lysiane gagnon   discussion   yeah   so you have some faith in johnson at this point  yes   which is actually the question i'm asking people  how are they feeling about mister johnson at this point  mhhm yeah   thanks for calling  thank you   seven nine two three four five one is now available  hello garret   yes good afternoon george   no i'm not with johnson at all on this  i mean he's uh he's perceived as  being part of uh coming down on the side of the separatists and uh where is the opposition to them  there is absolutely no opposition in our our   national assembly  do do are are   you telling me that you think daniel johnson is a separatist  well he's a sometimes federalist  i don't know laugh whether he's a separatist or not  it's hard to figure him out  he's trying to be all things to all people  he's eh he's forgetting the uh  that the no people are with him but only if he sticks up for the no  i mean as far as uhm from what  what i can see uh during the last few days he seems to be on bouchard's side  hmh hmh  a and you're referring specifically to his ah agreeing that uhm the decisions about quebec's future have to be made by quebecers  well of course  but i mean we're we're not  dis i mean the the issue in the court is the legality of the constitution and i mean if he can't stand up for the legality of our canadian constitution then he's not a canadian    i feel anybody that is not backing that up isn't a true canadian  okay sir  thanks for calling  this is the star line and this would be alvin   al   yeah how are you george   i'm always fine  good  george i uhm support absolutely the federal government getting involved and as a matter of fact it's shocking to me how we've allowed the separatists to manage this entire episode over the last fifteen years  and a good example of that is let's look at the question they asked us  if i understand it correctly the question said do you give us permission to talk to the federal government and if that doesn't work out then certainly our option is to separate  am i correct that that was the correction  well they weren't really asking permission to talk to the federal government as i understood the question  they were saying we're going to vote to become sovereign  however having voted to become sovereign we're going to offer an association with canada and if they accept it in a way that we accept within a year fine otherwise we go our own way  word   but then they come back and they take their forty-nine percent and they say well here are our forty-nine percent of the population who support separation  which is untrue  they a good  goodly portion of that forty-nine percent support  negotiation with the federal government   that this is true  and and yet you know   you're talking about two million people who voted yes and a lot of them weren't for total independence  and nobody questions him about that  it's incredible  i hear them in speaking to the federal politicians and being quoted in the press  and it's startling to me  so yes absolutely the rules have to be fair for both parties and they haven't been up to now  and daniel johnson  daniel johnson's a nobody  and i'm afraid that there are two two  entities here to deal with one called the federal government and the other one are the power-grabbers in quebec city  i'm sorry but daniel johnson and all the other individuals like mister charest who i i can't understand this guy either   where does he sit  did you hear what he said this morning  he said to the effect i believe uh that uh quebec should d decide its destiny   yeah  i i can't figure him out  he i mean i would have thought he was the kind of guy who was open-minded and bright enough to realize that it's a canadian issue as well as a quebec issue   okay sir  thanks   thanks   thanks  hello julia   automated voice message saying, "" words  nouveau""   whoa the nouveau means there's nobody there the nouveau so we'll go to somebody else  where would you like me to go here steve uh  steve is in charge of this program  you always thought that i had something to do with it but  word   okay we'll go to evan on number one  hello evan   yes hello george   hi  george uh i watch politics and that's no way to convince a person to vote  uh it shows that the people   wh what's  no way  well the way they're acting uh for instance should know about canada and uh that you know that all members of parliament must swear an ode not "" oath"" of allegiance to the queens and   and that is pledging to uphold her every action "
Canada	" and then it's a myth that you know that uh  canada has this whole right to self-determination  that's why quebec is uh saying   it's a myth that canada has a right to self-determination  well i i believe so because the parliament gives up daily secrets to the governor general and his position is to report to the queen the findings to the queen    and then the queen exercises her uh prerogative powers on canada     sir   so the way i feel this i feel that this helps explain why there's not a dime's worth difference between being a british   a british colony or what we are now repatriated constitution  alan  yes am i wrong  yes  tell me where  alan the queen has no say in what we do  nothing whatsoever  she's a figurehead in britain let alone here  here she doesn't get to be the figurehead very often  uh the queen doesn't get the secrets of the canadian government whispered into her ear  the queen doesn't hear from the governor general of canada very often unless it's a request that she uh visit moose jaw in nineteen ninety-eight  uh believe me uh the queen doesn't have influence  at least canada is sovereign  quebec maybe isn't but canada is  honest  well if canada is sovereign why can't canada  or canada should take say here are my cards i'm laying them on the table   and lay em them to the voters because   george when you have a a voter who votes he's or her sh they  are the people that vote and get government in power and no government can can say say or or say and do anything that they want to say or do when it comes election-time until a voter says yes or no  and go after the voter  give the voter something  but the voters have said some things here in quebec sir  commercials and traffic report   okay back to the telephone on feedback with george fraser word   we're talking specifically about daniel johnson but generally about the situation over the last few days  sorry i don't have any lines here but i i'll  give you the number so when we do clear out a line you can get through  seven nine two three four five one and star eight two five four news   we go to the star line and bob   hello bob   hello bob   hi it's bobby   bobby   i'm an angry-phone play on "" anglophone"" and i'd like to make a comment on mister cot&eacute;   yeah   i mean it's becoming patently obvious that this so called neutrality here uh whether there's a conspiracy i don't know and i'm not qualified to know but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to start figuring out that there was shall we say some collusion along the line here  i mean they you know they basically took out a hundred thousand votes or who knows exactly and it appears kind of strange to me where they're going to take criminal actions i think the  the these egos are incredible against individuals who are were showing solidarity vis &agrave; vis trying to keep canada together  should daniel johnson be raising hell about that or should he be  i think daniel johnson is a total hypocrite and the problem is if you're an angry-phone here who do you have to vote for  i think he's a closet separatist  i think well i don't know i may we i'll  take that back  i just think he's not showing a lot of fortitude in coming forth and stating his real position is as a   supposedly as a federalist  but what really gets to me and a lot of people around uh is  this this attitude that the separatists have that they on their own can determine what they want to do and it's international law and the canadian constitution's irrelevant and what three and a half million quebecers feel is irrelevant and i think it's about time well we'll see  they they appeared to have stepped up to the plate on this bertrand case but the reality of it is that the rest of the country would be highly effected economically and in other ways as well by a unilateral declaration of independence  and if we had a real government in ottawa they would take these people to task and basically stipulate that uh uh a referendum is  is politically uhm yeah well and it's economically and politically destabilizing for all canadians   and as would be unilateral declaration of independence  far as i'm concerned the current word  government is a rogue government and if they keep it up in any normal country they'd no "" be"" put put in jail for treason  i'd like to hear laugh your comments on that  laugh well i think we're a long way from treason but i appreciate your call bob   thanks for calling here  and i just uh will i'm sure he's listening in his car i  will say again i i am in a position to know  personally daniel johnson better than i've ever known any other premier  now in our business we do get to meet all of them at one time or another but uh daniel johnson is uh eh is a committed federalist  there's no question about that  you can question how he goes about being a a  committed federalist and that's fair game  but he is that  i assure you  i i've as a matter of fact uh a few weeks ago before the johnsons went on a tour of the west i had uh lunch with missus daniel johnson susan marseille who i also uh know and uhm she was i mean she's   she's like a crusader for canada  she's so passionate about canada  and the reason we were lunching together is they had some appointments uh to be on some talkshows out west and she wanted my opinion about who ah wou would be amenable to uhh to letting them get the message accross and who might not and so on  uhm if i may talk about the couple they are they are very much federalist greatly federalist  uh doesn't mean that they do everything right and doesn't mean that he does everything right but that much you shouldn't doubt   okay let's see what jared has to say  hello jared   hello   hi  extra corpus commentary   okay sir  i think you're a little uhm cynical about politicians  i don't hold it against them that they want to be elected  you can't do what you want to do without being elected  uh but i think most politicians and it doesn't matter what stripe  are into it because there are certain things they believe in and they want to accomplish them  however you notice i didn't interrupt  i let him give his whole speech there  hello raymond   yes hello  uh i could react to your uh previous caller this bobby  character and his absurdities but i i won't waste my breath but i would like to submit this to you sir concerning  the uh the march uh uh in october preceding the referendum and the report that came out i would i would ask you are are the laws that were made up in quebec concerning referendum are these valid to you  if you are telling me   are these legal  are are would you listen now  you've asked a question  if you're telling me that i can't go to a rally without charging the money to the no side or the yes side let me tell you cos i'm assuming now that you're a separatist  yes i am  let me tell you that the most stinking dirty filthy  trick of the whole referendum campaign was using the people's money the people's money through the caisse de deaigupocircumflext quebec co-operative bank to prop up the canadian dollar to give the lie that the canadian dollar wasn't being affected by the referendum  you're not   you're not answering my question  so if   so if i'm answering your question  no you're not answering my question  your baloney question   you're you're a passionfruit   i am answering you're question  you are an idiot  sorry about that  i'm not supposed to get mad  and so ladies and gentlemen smiling he said let us go to the next caller  but let me finish what i said  if i've gotta got to charge up my i went by subway to that ah gathering if i  gotta got to charge up my token to the no committee there's something wrong with the referendum law  it stinks  and that's basically what they're talking about  you know somebody flies in from vancouver and today we've got a little bit less of a price and so that's cheating that's lying  that's crap  that's what that is  and the caisse de deaigupocircumflext  spending hundreds of millions of your dollars to buy canadian dollars so that the obvious won't be there that the canadian dollar is being affected by the referendum that was cheating  that was money cheating  and that was the yes side  and they didn't investigate that one did they  and it was your dough  hello steven   hi how are you  well i'm just fine  i'm in a very good mood  word so am i  ya laugh   you know what i got a solution to this whole problem  you remember in seventy when they sent in the tanks well they should sent in the airforce the army and the navy to scare these guys because you can't talk to these guys  these separatists you can't talk to them  they only understand what not "" when"" the   the c f eighteens are flying over that's when they understand  that's the answer  okay sir  i don't agree but uhm some people would agree with you probably  i don't think there's much doubt about that  there's some people who think this thing oughta  ought to come down laugh to warfare eventually  uh i'm not of that ilk  hello melissa   hi  i find this whole thing pretty scary  i want to ask your opinion  uhm how what would it take to get a complete recount of the last referendum  i uh think that we're beyond the the  point where uh it could uh be done  and even if it were done uh uh so what  well   the the declaration would be that the no side won but we already have that declaration   no but the point being that we're supposed to be a democracy  and the thing that we cherish the most is going out and voting for the government that we want  no i quite agree i   so uhm i really think that if daniel johnson is really a federalist as he claims to be i have no trust in him anymore uhm he would somehow find a way to have a complete recount because uhm what if we do have another referendum and they win  i mean really c uh god forbid they are going to be our government  i don't know what's going to happen here  but recounting the last one ma'am is not going to have any effect on the next one  well no but recounting the last one will show they really want to come clean  yeah i must say that i agree with tommy schnurmacher uh who says that he thinks there was probably no ballots destroyed in every one of the one hundred and twenty-five ridings in quebec  i wouldn't be surprised  i i believe that because i know when i went to vote uhm for the first time in my life they questioned me  yup  and i found that strange but of course i didn't know of the goings-on until after the polls closed  they questioned me too and they made me swear that uh i needed to vote in the advance poll which of course i did because i was working here during the election and when i put my left hand on the bible to do my swearing uh they allowed laugh word  it wouldn't count unless i put my right hand  how's that one for you  laugh   okay   i'd like to get after daniel johnson to make sure that we know the real truth here because i this is wrong  okay ma'am  thanks  thanks to all of you  we're out of time  boy oh boy anyway we leave as usual all of the lines hanging there  oh well you can talk to tommmy over the next few hours  tomorrow free-for-all feedback so on "
Canada	" now more of the eliza green show on a m eight hundred c j a d  eleven oh eight the c j a d time  jenny billups will be in in a few minutes but we've tied  raymond lafleur to the chair after we let him out and had a smoke  laugh   raymond laugh is a journalist who writes for  le soleil and l'actualit&eacute; and he's the author of a new book on lucien bouchard called en attendant la suite uh waiting for what comes next as we look at lucien bouchard the man  and uh well no more words for me i'll let the callers who been waiting for ya you   hello miles   uh good morning   yes sir  question   no it  second question   okay uh the first question about europe i refer to are not that old  i refer to the europe that started to build in nineteen fifty-eight  and the europe i i am refering it's not the post-war eu europe it is the  the europe where heads of governments would develop what they call the reflexful co-operation  they all together make now  well first the foundation was with marshall aid americans  and i don't think americans help any money they are going to pull money into quebec if we seperate   mer   you know   okay but ah right anyway we disagree on that because to me europe was w they started to build it in nineteen fifty-eight with the treaty of rome  but i'd like to go back at your question though  you said mister romeno uh and others are true canadians  ya yes sir   i remind you sir that in nineteen seventy in nineteen seventy-nine nineteen eighty marc lalonde then minister of energy for pierre elliot trudeau doubted peter lougheed premier of alberta was a true canadian  i don't understand why you going so far back you going to nineteen seventy-nine we live we don't live in nineteen seventy-nine we live in nineteen eighty-three i mean nineteen ninety-six   well click on the phoneline   whoops  hello  hello  hello   you still there  ya i'm still here   good  continues point   mhm i know that  ya   yeah because you have been an independent professional for all your life  but that's a that's another issue   audible exhale breath   okay uh his point were the other premiers never tried to break up the country  lucien bouchard did does  which is true yes  but there was a view at the time and i want to go back at this when when there was a real conflict of interest between alberta there and saskatchewan to some extent  the oil and natural gas reached provinces uh parts of the country and and the the  rest of the country and then people were saying well you don't want to share you want to go your separate way  word   but but peter lougheed never threatened to take alberta out of confederation  yeah but eliza i would suggest that that  having not waiting anymore to share wealth with the rest of the country not only quebec but newfoundland as well and new brunswick if you don't want to share your wealth and this   that goes with ontario as well maybe uhh you got to beg the country more surely than bouchard is going to do  alberta is alberta's not going to give their oil free to eastern canada any more than quebec is going to give free their hydroelectric power  right right   it works both ways  so if you're going to talk that way about  one you have to talk that way about  the other   yes   ya   yes   but but at the same time you know  when when the opec the opec producers the arabs got uh they literally blackmailed the world uh because of the the war with israel et cetera   why we canadians we would have paid world price of our  word   that was the issue  then mister trudeau was great at explaining that being a canadian means sharing kay okay   uh so uhm ah in terms of economics i i  would say that some provinces are not very good canadians in  in the minds of uh jean chr&eacute;tein or pierre elliot trudeau  good morning pam   good morning  i'd like to speak to mister lafleur   he's right here go ahead   yes   mister lafleur i believe i heard you say earlier  that mister parizeau brought the separatist vote to forty-nine point five  or point four well yes   or point four alright   right   ya   yes   you said that  yes  well we now know that there has been some cheating involved  so de he didn't really bring it up to that point  that's what i'd like to tell you  thank you  but but at the same time madam the chief electoral officer said that uh the few thousand votes that had been cheated well uh it wouldn't cheat that much  let's say that it was more than forty-nine anyway  mavis good morning  good morning eliza and monsieur lafleur   monsieur lafleur i know you are very articulate  because i read you in french  good  so therefore would you please do me a favour the whole c j a d audience and the population of quebec in general to  define for me one word which will be i believe in my estimation give the answer to what does quebec nee need  uh uh what does quebec want if only he can define for me in french with the french meaning of  distinct the adjective  distinct as in  soci&eacute;t&eacute; distinct   well two things in one word what does quebec want i would say respect  oh and quebec doesn't have any respect  they don't feel look eliza  i'm i'm not the  spokesman for the whole quebec  oh they don't feel   i know   but but they don't feel happy  but your question is very important madame  in my opinion we should get rid of the distinct society  vocabulary  i agree with you one hundred percent because first of all it was a bad s translation of distinct   i suggested recently and maybe i leave you  your uh the people who listen to us with that    cough   in english quebec is homeland of the french culture in america and i think everybody would agree with that  and at the united nations homeland is always translated in french by patrie   like the palestinian uh uh they they say it's homeland of palestinians at the same time they say in french it's  patrie de palestiniens   so why is it that we don't say quebec is homeland of the french culture in america  i think it is acceptable   isn't that what the federal the federal liberals did a couple of weeks ago  well they tried with foyer principal and that  wha what the heck is the difference except they called it the fireplace but uh   my point is uh distinct society has become a symbol in quebec   yes   if you want to get rid of it you've got to find a better word  but but not different but better word  and patrie i suggest to you is much better word than because there is  patriotism et cetera uh than foyer principal  which as you know is leads to all sorts of jokes  but i agree with the fundamental question we should get rid of  distinct   but i'm not the prime minister of canada so uh you know i'm here to solve the problem but i not "" i'm"" here to give suggestions  and i'm puzzled by to know that presently  today when we talk there is still three premiers in english canada i won't give you the name still trying to push around to get distinct society to be accepted  i think they are wasting their time  they're ve very respectable person  it's very nice what they tried to do for quebec but i know it won't wash because uh it it has become and as by the symbol in english canada in that it is a good symbol in quebec in french quebec so  raymond thanks for coming in  thank you very much thank you   raymond lafleur is a journalist and the author of a new book called lucien bouchard en attendant la suite   it's available in paperback at your bookstore  eleven sixteen the c j a d time   eleven twenty the c j a d time  well let's shift gears and jenny billups is here  we'll have a nice relaxing chat about where to find things  jenny billups writes in the gazette  she's the author of smart shopping montreal  she's created quite a little industry all by herself  of of finding great discounts  and of course you can call ah and ask jenny where to find anything in particular that you're looking for  seven two nine one one three six   but one of the things we wanted to talk about was uhm stuff for camp  and being the mother of two boys i found out that there's  no point in buying almost no point in buying them jeans cos because they live in sweats  both of my kids live in sweatpants and sneakers  and uh the sweats if you buy cheap ones they fall apart so you have to buy new ones  and if you buy expensive ones which will last they end up out-growing them and the sweatpants last longer than the kid you know i mean  uh so what do you do  where do you find stuff for camp  well for camp do they they wear sweats in camp too is it really shorts and t-shirts   they wear they wear sweats and t-shirts and bathing suits and sneakers the laugh same thing they wear at home   uhm   except at home i make them wear clean ones  laugh   laugh   well it makes it easy for camp because you can send anything there you don't know what they're wearing  uhm there there are some obvious answers  uhm schreter's on the main is really known as a camp outfitting store because they get the lists from the camps and they know exactly what the camps need and desire and recommend actually to be fair  i buy stuff at schreter's for them uhm even for the school year  so   umhm   my kids don't have to wear uniforms and i go in and i get  raincoats and t-shirts and sweats and pants and it just makes  l life and underwear and socks it just makes life easier to buy it all at one shtore  store spliced shop and store   well you don't last for whatever fifty years in a city if you're not providing exactly things like that things that last thing  you're going to go in you're gonna going to get and the service there is terrific   yeah   they have someone helping you  uhm another new place we could mention if you're just going to pick up stuff for camp is winner's uh which is just just opened up uh a new one at d&eacute;carie square  oh that's true   is it d&eacute;carie square  is it d&eacute;carie square now   they changed their name back laugh   they have one at d&eacute;carie   they changed it back at d&eacute;carie square   and there's another one near sources right   right there's one out on the west island  and and winner's is a cousin of t j maxx  uhm it's kind of got the same perception which is we're  gonna going to buy up a whole lot of namebrand things  ends-of-lines clearances sometimes seconds and we're just  gonna going to give it to you for great prices but do it in volume  so it is it doesn't work as well as t j maxx if you shopped in both i think t j maxx might   t j maxx owns winner's or uh kind of  uh kind of you know it's kind of  there's some some connection there between the two  uh then there's also there's a place uh do you ever go to creations monie on beaumont  this is the in the back of a factory this is true outlet shopping uhm it's one thousand beaumont i believe i'd better look that up and uhm you go to the back of the building and up a flight of stairs and and the factory sends up there the sweats and and t-shirts and shorts and all those things you need for ah camp at great prices  and they even have a back room with old merchandise for really ridiculously cheap prices  so that's another great but but  their sizing there would be more or less from m you know maybe up to about twelve or fourteen "
Canada	 if your kids are bigger than that you know that won't work and uhm  the the hardest thing i found i remember we used to get questions about this and i never realized what a problem it was is for boys and i imagine for girls but i'm the mother of boys who reach a certain age where their size is bigger than their age  my my older son is only ten but he's already five feet tall wears a size seven men's shoe and he's not a man he's a little boy  right   it's worse for girls actually  { > oh really   for guys you really can get away with putting them in a man's pants putting them in a man's running suit it's not going to make a difference  when you take a little girl and you try and put her in a  ladies' size five or seven it ain't isn't   gonna going to work because she's a different shape  so it's much harder for the girls and there's less to buy cos again you want them to look like a little girl but the ladies'  stuff is gonna going to be much too mature  that's true   so you're really lucky that you have boys  uhm it's it's sort of easier yeah  and the men's shoes you still can get a boot you know  that that looks good on him a slip on a tie shoe that's  gonna going to look like a kid could wear it   so   can you get running shoes for example most of the kids wear running shoes i guess periodi  periodically once a year they wear loafers uh can you get running shoes at at the cheap price good shoes at the great prices that you can see sometimes in the states  no laugh laugh okay   laugh   uh again schreter's has running shoes it's one of the places to get them  uhm the sales in the sports stores you know sports experts and all those will feature sales  if you if you watch those flyers that come in every week they will have certain models at fifty-nine dollars or sixty-nine dollars and you know if you transfer that into a u s price and  you're not going to get much in the u s for forty bucks in a running shoe  so you're almost in the same price range  so those are the kind of sales you look for  eaton's will do the same thing the bay they will feature a nike a reebok you know one or two of their lines and if your kid will accept that that's about the only way you're going to do it here  jenny our lines are filled so that our time for chatting is up  laugh   we're gonna going to take a break and then we'll uh let the callers at ya you   seven two nine one one three six even though all the lines are filled and star eight one four four for jenny billups   sh smart shopping montreal  eleven twenty-five the c j a d time commercial   eleven twenty-seven the c j a d time  irma good morning you're on with jenny billups   good morning this is not a question related to camp but i'm wondering where i can pick up some beanbag chairs  deep inhale i had a terrible pro i can relate  my kids really want them and i can't think where to buy them  i had to have them made laugh but i have two i'd like to sell if you want them   okay laugh

and she made the two beanbags   laugh   laugh   the problem is that my children couldn't differentiate between a trampoline and a beanbag laugh chair  well that's exactly it  i think they're finally old enough that they could actually use them as they were meant to be used  ya  but uhm ya by i would be very   interested   no they aren't terribly popular these days  i haven't honestly seen them in a lot of furniture stores lately  i haven't really seen them unless a kid's store  you'd have you have to look in every y i i saw them in a store recently i can't remember where but uh you you

Canada	 you're talking a forty percent uh so-called mark-up or margin of profit which is uh fairly hefty  that's right  la presse local newspaper uh has another interesting story which is that uh it says that uh  a sergeant-detective with the m u c police has been suspended for using his service rev- revolver to shoot a raccoon in old montreal  the paper say this happened at around eleven p m on saturday night  kinda kind of reckless isn't it?  well it s- sounds like it  he wasn't on duty at the time uhm and but  he saw the the raccoon making his way behind  an apartment building where the officer lives and he shot it twice apparently  uhm then officers from station fifty- thirty-three  which is near there arrived a few minutes later and began an investigation  now the police haven't released the name of this officer and the paper says qu- and i'll quote the paper as usual information about an incident involving a member of the police force was not available   so the police are are really being quiet about this  the animal apparently disappeared after it was shot nobody's found it  uh berger blanc local animal control was called but they they looked around and they couldn't find it   yeah i think there are other ways to  to get your target practice and i don't think uh the traditional way is to go after raccoons especially ah for the precedent that it sets because there are lots of raccoons in the city nowadays   well alright   especially in the middle of the city alright  in old montreal on saturday night  ah boy  aah parizeau is back from vacation and back on the front pages in a big way today not just talking about pot but other things  he's ah accusing ah the federal referendum minister lucienne robillard of trying to organize a common front with the nine other premiers  he says the premiers are getting ready to gang up and say that they would not discuss economic or political links with a sovereign quebec  uh he says that uh ma- manitoba's   premier gary filmon was asked to lead the common front so he uh sort of came out and tried to expose this yesterday  when the papers uh contacted the premiers though they said they didn't know anything about this  mike harris says he doesn't know about it and so did some of the others  robillard is quoted as saying that this is all just a fiction invented by parizeau to make people forget what else lobsters   laugh parizeau's alleged comment that a 'yes' vote would leave quebeckers like lobsters thrown in a pot of boiling water   laugh   and  well c b c uh radio news reporter den mccouglin based out of montreal is uh looking at that story by the way  and uh if you listen to world report today you could get more on that  and uh now that parizeau is back the lobster puns have been revived  the the front page of the gazette says that lobster is back on the menu and uh that's because  laugh the issue came up yesterday at the press conference  laugh   parizeau denied saying that uh saying uh  he denied what was reported in la presse the day that the story broke  and he kinda kind of side-stepped though when uh he was asked well wh- did you mention lobsters to the european ambassadors at all?   uhm he says that the whole thing is just laughable and ridiculous and it's really just a a quarrel among journalists  sally thanks very much  you're welcome  sally salvy will be back i-  in less than an hour to talk a bit more about what's some of  the columnists are saying in the paper this morning   cam uh any impact yet?  impact not a good word  to l- to use laugh when we're talking about traffic there kyle   laugh   laugh   no no impact   no collisions  good   no  no impact so far but uh we'll keep an eye out for that   sally salvy is back as she is every day at this time with a look at a couple of the editorials in the morning papers  uh before we go to that though sally i imagine you're one of those people who is breathing a sigh of relief with a bit more rain for the garden even though we had a lot of rain on the uh  on the weekend uh there's been kind of a dry summer so  yes although the only problem with that is that you have to cut the grass  at least when it's brown it stays short and you can leave it like that  when it there's more work when it rains  laugh that's true   all that work to be done  so what's in the editorials this morning  well uh jean-robert sansfa&ccedille;on has an  a long editorial in le devoir today about the marijuana growing in kanesatake  he says that uh when the government decided to crack down on cigarette smuggling you know this is both the provincial government and the federal government   what they did was they reduced taxes tobacco taxes  they didn't really do anything about the smuggling conducted by mohawks  and so he says uh when it became less profitable for criminals in the community to uh to smuggle tobacco they turned to other products  and he says ah marijuana is not the most dangerous of the products that they ha turned to   he says that the warriors are really thugs who don't have the interests of uh the community at heart  they uh don't care about the social economic development of  of the community and that they're just uh  and the proof is that they're  they're bringing young people into the contraband trade and into the marijuana trade  he says uh and meanwhile the racism in the white community is growing against the native people  and he thinks that the situation is getting dangerous and that  the government really should do something  no question that uh this this story has exposed a problem that exists at many many levels  uh both in the mohawk community and beyond the community  and it's all about relationships uh within that community and without that community and uh uh indeed there laugh  hopefully there's uh there'll be some solutions that'll be found  well he he really goes into  he he really analyzes the kind of shirking of responsibility on the part of the the federal and provincial governments on this issue so it's quite an a   long and analytical editorial  uhm pierre gravelle has an editorial in la presse  today about the two big libel suits that were in the news last week  do you remember there was a story that uh the biggest award ever was given to uhm uh a case w- uh up-  upheld by the supreme court and in this case the  the church of scientology was sued for one point six million dollars   and the other story of course was that uh lucien bouchard is suing the popular radio host andre arthur  gravelle says that uh the church of scientology claimed at the time to be deprived of of its freedom of expression by the court's decision   yet he says the scientologists try themselves on many occasions  to use the libel laws to muzzle journalists who are making legitimate enquiries into their finances and recruiting methods so that whenever journalists were getting close to something uh about their recruiting methods or their finances they would then threaten them with a lawsuit a libel suit  uhm and he says that uh uhm it's true that the media does try to protect its own interest in these cases and does often say that uh uh freedom of ek- expression is at stake  but he says not too many uh colleagues of andre arthur are going to cry for him if he's convicted  gravelle says that uh the biggest threat to freedom of expression comes not from the courts but from buffoons and deg-   demagogues like arthur who think that they can say anything they want as soon as they get in front of a microphone  well the thing about that bouchard story that strikes me though is that i think probably would've got much much less attention  if if the suit had not been launched by bouchard  that it was a story that wasn't getting much play outside of arthur's show and uh also uh a few uh publications that don't have a widespread circulation  so it seems that the suit has brought more attention to the story which the story which obviously upsets bouchard in the first place  well and there's als- also  the amount of money it's one point four million dollars so  arthur has been sued many times in the past i don't think uh perhaps uh for that much money  sally thanks very much  you're welcome  sally salvy is here every day at this time with a look at a couple of the editorials from the morning papers and uh if you're tuning in at about six fifteen every morning she has a very complete rundown on uh what's in all the papers uh that circulate around montreal  it is uh twenty-one minutes now after seven

Canada	 good afternoon and welcome to free-for-all weekend edition where the free-for-all gang looks at the news of the past week and makes some comments about it  the free-for-all gang being of course tim smith alan rinaldi eliza green and george fraser   and ah i guess uh uh in montreal one of the big things that came out this week although it was early in the week and by now it's kind of uh a bit in the past but we had a couple polls that came out early in the week  interesting in both cases  one case ehm anglos anglophones  suggesting that they're outta out of here in many cases  although there could be a little exaggeration in that i suppose  and in the other case all ah montrealers including francophones allophones canadian meaning is 'someone whose first language is neither french nor english' and anglophones uh seemingly much more lenient about what kind of a city montreal should be ah compared to the people that uh govern us at all at all levels really  i don't think those polls exaggerate in fact they may understate because i've seen polls of young people which indicate a figure as high as seventy-five percent who who  plan to leave  and of course for a lot of older people they feel well there's too late to leave now or their jobs are here or they have a mortgage here but for younger people that constraint isn't there  that and and of course it's the leaving of the younger people in the long run that hurts more   mhhm oh ya for sure   well there ah ah number of things that come up from the polls  one about the sign issue policy re: signs' language  cough is that the politicians are woefully out of touch with what people really want or really care about  it's indicative that the p q parti quebecois, governing political party has been and continues to be obsessed not just with separation but with language and it is not an obsession with your garden variety quebecer  they have other things to worry about like eating for example  or working  laugh   that's more important  so i think that uh that the poll indicates that to a great extent  and the other thing about the other poll leaving  i don't think is an exaggeration  what what i do think it is is are people going to leave in terms of separation  ya i don't think i i've cough  met or heard too many people on the air who say that if quebec separate   they would they would leave but that doesn't mean they're leaving tomorrow or next week or even next year it means in the event   ya that's the part that i think is exaggeration in that poll  they they're talking about thirty percent who say they're leaving within five years no matter  i'm quite sure that five years ago we had a similar poll that said  thirty percent were leaving within five years no matter   we did as a matter of fact   ya ya   in nineteen ninety-one we had a poll that said  exactly the same thing  exactly   exactly   ya and it and it's easy to say to a ah pollster you know uh yes you're fed up and the pollster calls and says what's your view would you leave within a you bet i would leave  but a but a lot of people can't  i i think the erosion is already taking place  i think what we're seeing is a ah gradual slip-sliding away of   the english population the english-speaking population  and i think that'll continue  people aren't leaving in masses  they're leaving as soon as they can sell their house and  reasonably find another job somewhere else  i mean they're not le leaving  because they want to they're leaving because they can't picture a continuance of life as they've had here in the future  and that's why they're going  i ah there are a lot of houses for   sale that don't have signs in front of them  oh ya   ah a lot of people that i've talked to have quietly said  ya well our future isn't here we're just ah we're finding our way out of here   getting back to what alan was saying about the young people i mean there is a certain segment of the anglo   anglophone population who have no children here anymore  i mean there's a segment of the population where uh their children two or three of them not one of them lives in montreal  mhhm   the vast majority live in somewhere  else in north america  and there are other segments of the population where you know two out of three have left or one out of three have left or one is planning to go or once the kid is in graduate school or or  university somewhere well why come back  that's the erosion that's the hardest part of it  not just for the community but also alan  in your in your living make a living  as a as a professor kids will leave and if you don't have a base from which to choose from the locals ah you have to reach out more and that gets harder to fund and all the other stuff that goes with it  ya if you look at the english schools they've been cut more than half in last twenty years  well that that you know that catches up that hits the universities eventually  i remember being in on the radio about two years ago with some professors who were saying oh it's never going to happen they'll keep coming   i said where're they going to come from  well it's happening of course  mhhm   enrollments are dropping in the universities now  but they are dropping all over north america   they are dropping all over north america but we're going to get it worse because the base you draw from   have we gotten it worse   ya oh ya  have we gotten it worse is there a greater drop in enrollment in montreal  universities than elsewhere in north america i'm not sure of that   word   word we'll know better  we'll know better cos this just started uh last year and we'll know better when we see the figures for the coming year  i think el makes a good point about oldsters too   there there comes a point uh in  many elderly people in montreal they're sure enough they're kids aren't here  uh and when they get to a point when they need special care there's nobody here to care for them   so if if your son and your daughter and all of their family are now living in missisauga when it comes time to be looked after i guess you gotta got to go to   missisauga   but now there is a problem because they are the ones that are least capable of pulling up roots and leaving   ya i   that's the real th  there's the rub and that's why we have to ensure that the heal health and   soc social that's why we shouldn't flee we should fight because we have to ensure that those that can't flee are protected  well that's right tim but if it comes a point where you're going to go into the nursing home and your pensions are going to pay your way it might as well be a nursing home in colberg or missisauga  but you pen pension   i'm col correct me if i'm wrong but it's very difficult if you're on the b on the bottom line of this equation like if you're not living on much more than you canada and quebec pensions it's very hard to make the transition from one province to the other  oh no no your your  quebec pension   no your pension's your pension's your pension it's portable  you can take it wherever   no problem   i mean don't you have to go onto a waiting list in the other province  no it's a question of of room  not all the provinces publicly funded old peoples's homes  like we do in quebec   that's what i mean ya   well that's what i mean   that's what i mean   ya but your pension your quebec pension goes where you go   yes yes i understand that that's word  but you're just talking about the other places  i'm talking about   but it's also a question that if you're living on the bare edge of survival and you see you know and the extra cost just of moving to this location is a is a   major hurdle word   ya but again   ya   but we're talking about a couple of things one is is it better to be old in a home alone here versus   a a little more expensive place but near your children you know that that's the most important thing and the other thing is as children i i suppose we can talk about this at word we can't leave uh leave the responsibilities of our parents to somebody else  yup   th th  that's right  if you're an old person uh and you're going to be in a  a nursing home it's kind of nice that uh your kids and your grandchildren can come by on sunday and say hello  uh they can't do that if the kids are in missisauga  ya i just realized how uh defeatist we've become in  all of this  ya   see i i tend to think   well i have this fight with my wife i say   she says she's a francophone  i mean she says we gotta got to leave this province these people are gonna going to make our lives hell   ya   and i said no we can't leave  this is our life this is quebec this is where we live this is our home this is where we are going to stay  there is a future here     tim   in ten ten years in ten years where do you think your kids will be tru  truthfully truthfully   my ki kids well both of them want to live here in quebec  where do you think they'll be  i think they'll probably be here in quebec  my kids are kinda kind of weird like that  well   ya no but i   laugh   my daughter's more french than english and my son   is really happy in quebec   i but i've i've   thought that too tim and i have three daughters all of whom are are so  so bilingual as to be virtually bicultural but two of them are grown up and guess what one lives in vermont and one lives in ontario  it's the problem is it's not simply a matter of language legislation or quarrelling over legislation it's the fact that this quarrel obscures everything else that has to be   added and nothing else  gets done and i think ultimately what's the most disgusting part of it   ya   well th that's  that's why it gets defeatist because no matter what we do this envelops this overshadows this wraps us this is our life  ya   that's right and it's sometimes a little tough  this is free-for-all on c j a d   back to free-for-all with uh tim smith alan rinaldi eliza green and george fraser reviewing the week's news  i guess nationally uh the story which story do you think was made the news more ac  across this country doug young and uh mister n&utilde;nez or the dubai in halifax harbour  they both were pretty big national stories this week   uh uh definitely the dubai i mean that was the biggest story   i guess the dubai ya ya   ah because ah for a variety of reasons that it was something out of a movie that happened on the high seas and that canada got involved almost by accident because the boat happened to be here and the eight filipino sailors asked for refugee status because the r c m p wouldn't get involved and then they would because one arm of the government overruled another arm of the government because the romanian i mean was international intrigue  laugh ya   ya it was  you know and just to throw a curveball in there i wanna want to know why the russian spies story hasn't gotten more coverage  i like that one  well i think i think   well these are only  speakers a, b and d all speak at same time   well it got pretty good coverage it got pretty good coverage in the globe  ya i think it's cos they were only spy cadets as it turned out  they were in training   ya they laugh   and uh they had been fully infiltrated by c s i s  canadian security and intelligence service and c s i s was watching and reading their mail and basically seeing what speaker cut off but a   ya 
Canada	 well marie macdonald was there like i was to witness uh the crowds boo and you don't often get that kind of uh volatile reaction at a tennis match  it's kinda kind of uh a staid crowd isn't it marie   and uh so it was a bit of a surpri- not a  not a surprise to see that but uh ah very different uh to experience that yesterday  yeah it's certainly not something you expect when you go to tennis  you expected at most little bit of polite applause or no applause  but but the boos certainly shook the stadium   as as rusedski walked in and walked out and took a breath and   well uh the the thing that got me too was that you know the boos didn't stop  and uh the umpire i guess had been instructed to to  quiet the crowd down by saying merci merci so as to try and get them to quiet down but it was kind of funny to hear  the the boos followed by the thank you boos thank you laugh   but that was his way of course to try to get the  the crowd to quiet down  but they weren't too out of hand  i guess not that unexpected though right that i mean you know this reaction was there  nooo  i mean greg rusedski everyone when we're talking about you know he's a native montrealer and he's welcome home but he doesn't consider himself a montrealer anymore  so you can't really expect much of a warm reception for someone  who who you know says that sort of thing  it was a tough day  he had two matches to play as you said he had to play in singles and in doubles  so maybe we can sort of start with with  the singles competition uhm which is really where the i guess we can call it the anti-greg rusedski sentiment uh started  and it started even before he walked out onto the court  you know as as he and michael joyce walked through their  through the stadium the crowd began to boo and we could see that they that he was coming just by the sound not even by by looking to notice him  and then as rusedski walked by the stands somebody actually took a tennis ball and threw it at him  now it missed him so he said oh it was okay but  but it did startle him and it sort of startled people in in  in the crowd who weren't really expecting that sort of   thing   yeah unnecessary word    unnecessary   i but i think the tennis ball i mean the tennis ball missile pretty much sums up what the match was like in terms of the crowd reaction  once in a while you'd get a little bit of light applause mm very polite applause  uhm there was a sign up in the stands which which  read in french welcome to montreal we love greg   but further along in the stands there was another sign which called greg rusedski le fou de la reine meaning the queen's fool   laugh yeah   so not uh not laugh a particularly welcoming  ah welcoming thing to look at  now i mean once in a while mm you m- uh might have thought you know and and you woulda   would have been correct in thinking that michael joyce was a canadian cos he certainly was the favourite in this match  and the cheers were so loud for him every time he won a point or anytime he touched the ball actually  they were about as loud as the the  cheers that rusedski got when he blew a point  now one of the things that was interesting was that greg rusedski  kept smiling throughout the match  he kept that smile pinned to his face from from  the warm up to the cool down to to  talking to to people later on  now either it was because it didn't bother him didn't want people to know he was bothered  but afterwards he said that it was because the crowd didn't bother him  didn't hurt my feelings or didn't hurt hurt  pronounced 'turt' me at all  i mean i i thought that i was going to get a a difficult reaction  i kind of expected it so i was prepared for it  i mean it was exciting i mean come on i mean how  how many times have you been to a tennis match and seen so much excitement from controversy going on  good practice for davis cup i guess  i i guess he makes a point to a certain extent and we saw that smile by the way in wimbledon  mm hm mm hm   again that match against pete sampras  even when he was losing he managed to maintain that smile  i wonder sometimes if whether or not that's a psychological technique that that he's e- employing   to to keep his spirit up uh when he plays tennis  well pete sampras was was quoted as saying that he really wanted to go out during wimbledon and wipe the smile off laugh greg rusedski's face so  wipe the smile off laugh   and y- you know it it was interesting because he he said that several times that he wasn't bothered by the boos and that he went out to just have some fun but it's interesting cos we talked to michael joyce the man   that that he faced in that match uh he saw a pretty different reaction when they walked out of the court together yesterday afternoon to that chorus of of boos  joyce says that you know the boos might not have affected greg rusedski during the match he mighta might have  been able to play but it certainly did have an effect on him before the game  i could tell before the match greg was really nervous and it didn't look like he was nervous because of he was playing me as much as it looked like he was nervous he doesn't know what really to expect  uhm  and so we walked out and all a sudden i hear-   we heard the boos coming and and  greg and i were kinda kind of laughing about it at first and  and then it just got you know even more and more  so it was it was tough because like i said again you know they're cheering for me but they're not really cheering for me because they like me they're just cheering for me cos  laugh he's the enemy all of a sudden  hmm  michael joyce uh talking a bit about uh the crowd reaction yesterday in his match with rusedski  now uh uh i notice he also said that uh it was difficult for him because he's a friend of rusedski so it put him in a tough spot  now rusedski uh as as tough as the afternoon was uh the doubles match in the evening was i guess even tougher  a bigger crowd and the sentiment even stronger  that's true  i mean he was not only going up against uhm a   a doubles team that was from quebec uh but it was uh  or from canada but a doubles team that was   that was from quebec  now when when the two sebastiens came in sebastien lareau and sebastien leblanc they were greeted by a standing ovation  and there was sort of a question of whether maybe the cheers for the quebecers would drown out the boos but you know that the   the sentiment switched  they walked in and soon as soon as the crowd saw rusedski the boos started  and they sort of trailed in came out in full force pronounced 'full forced'   and you know just to give you an idea of how loud they were you could hardly hear the player introductions coming out over the loudspeaker  now rusedski on the other hand said he thought the evening crowd actually showed more respect particularly towards his partner paul wekesa  i i thought it was calmer  when i came on i mean obviously gave us a little bit of a tough time but i thought they were very polite in certain respects because paul was there and i i was pleased about that because paul has nothing to do with it so  at least to give paul some respect  cough   that's uh again greg rusedski talking a bit about uh uhm his partner during uh the doubles match yesterday  uh now we've uh heard a lot from sebastien lareau and greg rusedski and the fact that there is uh some tension between the two  tell me a bit more about that element of all this and how it played out in the match and afterward  well i- tape cuts out   it actually started out uhm earlier before the game had even the match had even started  there was the talk that lareau had said the other day that there was a lot of motivation for him to win  rusedski uh in contrast said it was just going to be another tennis match for him but sebastien lareau said several times he had the motivation he really wanted to win this one he really wanted to win this one  uhm in the end and and  last night it switched  all of a sudden he was saying no it was just uh a regular match and it wasn't uh as important that he was just going out there to play to play tennis  rusedski felt the same way  but we've heard a lot from them from sebastien lareau and greg rusedski um but other canadian tennis players have remained relatively quiet  last night i had a chance to ask sebsatien leblanc what he thought of all the build up around this first doubles match  i saw the match as another match i guess  i i don't care about what greg does i don't care about what wekesa does   it's   they're just both tennis players  i i i think it's ridiculous that uh  you know you think it's a battle of ex-canadians  it doesn't matter what he's doing  uh it's his choice  i know it some well maybe it's not the right choice but if he if that's his choice that's good  but uh i think it's just ridiculous that you know you it's not a battle  tennis is a game and  sebastien leblanc  ma- marie macdonald thank you very much for this report  thanks kyle   and uh cam jeffreys joins me again  you know cam i was down uh at the old port last night and the c word was was the common uhm the   the c letter i should say uh was the theme as it turned out  i didn't actually go and and pay the three fifty that you have to to get on the pier to go see the show  i know lauren elliot was down there last night and i was there too late for him so i decided not to go  but i walked around and first i saw a street performer uh playing some cat stevens music  and then there was another street performer who was playing some show tunes from cats  and then there was uh somebody playing some cantonese music  so we got three cs so far  and then there was the aroma lady  have you run across the aroma lady yet  she is the woman who word   mmm no unless she's one of the women in the bays who squirts you with perfume or something   laugh no this is a different kind this is the morning aroma   okay laugh   the one that you're probably smelling this morning coffee  that's the other c  she walks around with a uh what looks like a huge backpack a space pack and it has a hose and she has coffee cups and she goes around giving free cups of coffee  i forget the name of the company that she does it for  it's probably a good thing  but uh she's the aroma lady and i and uh she   oh okay   but it's always coffee though that she uh  cos there are other kinds of aromas you know  there's not just coffee there's other uh unpleasant aromas too  that uh   it's always coffee   th we well  this this is the coffee lady   you wouldn't want cups of whatever  those words   no this is coffee  this is quite quite simple  the bean   okay laugh   you certainly get around don't you  you you saw tennis yesterday you went down to the old port   it's the summer you know   and you get up and you do the show   you you  gotta got to enjoy the city cam   you're full of energy   hello sean   hi how are you  i'm always fine  okay well i think i'm an educator okay  n and i know some very well-educated and very well-to-do people and god help the children if they ever have children  mm hmm  cos they have no idea what it means having a child is a commitment or anything  and you talk about big brother taking over well you look at the schools they're full of preschool programmes after school programmes lunch programmes breakfast programmes supper programmes  n and you think that's good 
Canada	 we're also gonna going to discuss the role of uh newspapers  we've been looking through the english press  the globe and mail national newspaper the uh  the gazette montreal newspaper uh column by gretta chambers uh the suburban montreal newspaper   the toronto star toronto newspaper had a very different play on st&eacute;phane dion today than did the gazette  how do you feel that the various newspapers are reflecting uh your opinion  there's a big story all over the uh suburban montreal newspaper  this week's uh suburban montreal newspaper about the rough treatment that daniel johnson got at a at a  meeting  and uh i wanted to bring up a specific issue about that  there was one participant who a member of the audience uh patrick rosatti who asked daniel johnson uh who told daniel johnson what you risk with distinct society is the rest of the country doesn't accept it and then the separatists have the excuse of saying we've been humiliated  and he brought up a fascinating point that i'd really forgotten about  he said for canada to entrench distinct society in the constitution  it has to be accepted by qu&eacute;bec  and of course the p q parti qu&eacute;becois government would not accept it so it's-> it's pointless  so it's very interesting the different plays  are you satisfied with the play of the various newspapers uh  which one do you read the gazette montreal newspaper the globe and mail national newspaper   how do you think they handled this national unity issue  do you feel they reflect the views of uh the community  seven three one seven eight eight three star six four nine nine is the number to call if you are a bell mobility subscriber  uh let's go to our first uh caller mick uh  good afternoon you're on c j a d montreal radio station   mick go ahead  uhm i was just wondering uh yesterday's uh senate appointment in alberta  they they the liberal government overrode the alberta senate election law  and i just wondered are if the liberal government given up tryna trying to push distinct society in alberta cos that is an incredible insult to those people  w'i well i don't know if they've given up  i think they they should give up  i mean it's quite clear the people of alberta and b c  british columbia aren't interested  and what i find ev even more fascinating and i w i was  reminded of it by this question asked by uh at  </} the meeting that daniel johnson uh was addressing that uh even if they convince could be 'convinced' b c british columbia and alberta i mean we wouldn't be dealing with the people of qu&eacute;bec the approval would have to come from the national assembly  and lucienne bouchard has s said   uh distinct society is too little too late  he's not interested in offers   so i think the rest of canada is starting to call their bluff  but all of this divisive debate   uh i agree with st&eacute;phane dion  it's very important that this be held in advance and we have guy bertrand to thank for this with guy bertrand to thank  for the uh for the fact that this is on the   the front burner  and as for your question caller i think that the federal government  is is starting to realize that uh there's no point  in pursuing distinct society  i mean i people in quebec ah many anglophones don't want it  they feel it would bad reflect very badly  on them  uhm the separatists don't want it  they think it's too little too late  the rest of canada doesn't want it because they feel it will give too much power to qu&eacute;bec  it sounds very much like charlottetown all over again  so i think they are are moving away from that and they're moving to plan b  they're moving towards being prepared for the referendum  and i think it's a refreshing change to see the federalist side speaking up and telling qu&eacute;beckers yes there is a cost to sovereignty  it is not a cake walk  it's not easy  and then the and uh as uh gretta chambers mentions in her editorial that this risks helping bouchard  if it does how come he's not in a better mood  he's in a lousy mood  he he's in a very lousy mood cos he has to be on the uh defensive  and when he was talking to me he almost admitted that sovereignty isn't helping the uh qu&eacute;bec economy on good morning america and he said uh  and his insults uh at jean chretien i think they're working too well either  he said that uh this is the quote he must wake up at night thinking that he'll be the prime minister of canada who couldn't prevent qu&eacute;bec democracy from transforming qu&eacute;bec from a province to a country   and uh i think it's bouchard's who's who's   waking up at night thinking he won't be able to trick enough lobsters into the pot  anyway thank you very much uh for calling between discussion patter, traffic report and commercials for 4 minutes 40 seconds  $a> good afternoon we're back  you're listening to the johnny stalmacher talk show on c j a d montreal radio station   earlier i mentioned an editorial by gretta chambers  she's not that impressed with the bertrand case  she calls it an alice in wonderland court case  uh uh i disagree i think he's brought up some very interesting points  and uh for the qu&eacute;bec government to argue that uh   what what referendum it's all uh hypothetical is nonsense because both parizeau and bouchard repeatedly said they'd use a fifty percent plus one vote in favour of sovereignty to trigger  separation  that's bertrand's argument  i think it makes sense  gretta chambers feels that it's an alice in wonderland court case  and she thinks that instead of concentrating on this court case the federal government would be uh better off trying to kill sovereignty with the kindess of a good for canada plan a before they bludgeon to death what goodwill they still retain in qu&eacute;bec  so gretta chambers feels that in order to for  the federal government to maintain any goodwill there should be more concessions to qu&eacute;bec  would you agree with that  give me a call uh seven three one seven eight eight three   would you agree with gretta chambers' uh approach  uh do you think the bertrand case is an alice in wonderland case and that the federal government would be better off trying to find uh ways to accommodate uh qu&eacute;bec  let's go to uh where do we go we'll go to anton   uh good afternoon you're on c j a d  hi  uhm i think uh what bouchard we've  gotta got to uh remember with lucienne bouchard   is  we cannot underestimate uh what he's done  in in light of all these good events  that he is still a very crafty politician and he still knows how to uh  you know uh play play on the events  like uh for instance johnny you're uh have said time and time again that if distinct society were pitched to him that he could use that as the mother of all humiliations  right  don't you think that he could use this guy bertrand case in the future as the pronounced heavily as 'thee' mother of all humiliations  no  a a abso absolutely not  because the arguments are if he's the one who decided to take part  this isn't a humiliation on the rest of canada and also this is coming he can't blame guy bertrand the rest of canada  guy bertrand's a founding member of the p q parti quebecois  yeah but couldn't couldn't   he say to the people of quebec that look they don't really respect us  i   well if he   couldn't he say that  well he who doe he says   first of all he says that anyway  he's gonna going to that no matter what you do so that we know that  that's his position  but he he can do all kinds of things but he can't blame guy bertrand and the uh federal government  guy bertrand's a qu&eacute;becker and he's a former sovereigntist  like i said he's one of the founders of the of the p q parti quebecois   i think that uh distinct society rejection uh would be what is what he needs  cos it is going to be rejected  i mean that's clear  and the federal government is ridiculous to attempt it because  what the the way they can get out of it is  they're saying why should we pursue something that's been turned down  in advance by the premier of qu&eacute;bec  so they should say as of today that's it  we tried to do it  there's no point in doing it because lucienne bouchard doesn't want it  i mean he lucienne bouchard stood up in the house of commons and voted against it  i agree  i agree but i i honestly believe that he could really uh this guy bertrand case is good news or this is for all federalists and canadians  i i see it also at the same time as  bouchard's political ammunition for the future   well the thing is you know you can always tell if it's working for bouchard or not if he's pleased about it  he's not pleased with guy bertrand  if he were pleased about it uh then then   i would uh worry  he ca like i said he can't   there's no way he can blame guy bertrand on the federalists  uh let's get back to the phones  we're talking about uh amongst other topics uh gretta  chambers' opinion that this is a an alice in wonderland uh court case and it's not an important court case and the federal government shouldn't have gotten involved in it  in all honesty she said neither should the qu&eacute;bec government  but she feels that we should go back to plan a  do you agree with that or disagree  uh we'll be back with more of your calls after we take this break commercials for approximately 2 minutes   good afternoon  we're back and we're discussing uh guy bertrand his court case and uh gretta chambers and your reaction to uh her column about uh the court case if you agree or disagree  we'll go to alan   good afternoon  congratulations johnny on your new job  thank you  i'm very i'm enjoying it  immensely  oh thank you very much  uh i i put gretta  chambers'   i've read a lot about her and i read your article in the gazette and everything but her she   i know she's intermarried whatever maybe français  whatever  the point is she's another richard holden another david payne  fir fir first of all  hold it hold it  first of all she's not intermarried uh  she she's uh a widow  and even if she a few words and   and   a few words was french   no no he wasn't   but even if he was what does that have to   to do with it   no i mean she's not she's not coming out positive  like richard holden david payne   these people are forfeiting our rights okay as canadian citizens  nobody has the right to take my canadian citizenship from me  no you're right i think the betrand case is uh making a point of uh of saying that   exactly   fine example   you're doing a good job  okay  thank you very much  tha   it's true  i mean one of the things that guy bertrand's making the point of saying that he doesn't want uh the separatists to do anything that takes away the rights of canadians living in qu&eacute;bec  and nobody has brought up that issue uh before   let's go to lenny   good afternoon you're on c j a d  i agree a hundred percent with guy bertrand's case  i think i even think the defense that the uh the qu&eacute;bec government  put is putting on is rather stupid and it's  gonna going to backfire against them   he is now is going to ask to uh indemnify every uh qu&eacute;bec uh every federalist in qu&eacute;bec for a hundred thousand dollars  there's a possibility that he's gonna   going to call both parizeau he's thinking of calling both parizeau and uh and bouchard   to testify because they said it really is uh it's really  cough there's really they're really not threatening uh a new referendum  i know they're word telling    word i disagree  totally  a few words   they're basically saying that a fifty percent plus one is uh is okay for sovereignty uhm to american television that's what they're saying and then in court they're uh saying the the exact opposite i>  imagine somebody for instance saying  technically i'm for the yes or for the no but for such ridiculous reasons that everybody understands that  it's really making words   mm   but shouldn't they at least have the right the freedom of expression to express that opinion  absolutely   that that's what i'm saying  yup  on the one hand you shouldn't force ah parizeau and bouchard to spend their money on them but on the other hand it's totally legitimate in a democracy to prevent somebody from having a sp a   a say   so the best solution is to allow groups outside the umbrella committee to speak independently as long as the money is raised uh   in uhh within the limits  so the government's primary argument is that this is the only feasible method of keeping spending under control for a referendum campaign  well that too is of course uh highly disputable 
Canada	" john keenan is the founder of the home run foundation which is co-ordinating the programme  he joins me now  good morning mister uh keenan   good morning  now how uh would this programme work how would you get kids out to the ball game  well uhm the key is publicity i mean uh we believe that uh  with the help of the media we'll get quite a few out uhn large numbers uh  we're going after the corporations to buy blocks of seats uhn large number of blocks of seats uh for our kids charities and our underprivileged stu organizations that are in and around montreal so we're very confident that with media support uh corporations will uh will donate heavily  what kind of incentives are you giving to the companies  to to try to buy these blocks of tickets  well again publicity uh widespread exposure the uh  the stadium scoreboard will offer publicity uh radio tv newspapers  okay   do they get a tax write-off  absolutely they will absolutely uhm  any any uh organization any non-profit organization can can get a uh tax receipt  so as long as uh th the organization that they're buying the ticket for is non-profit they will get a tax receipt  okay   okay uhm i it occurs to me that uhm that if if if you know this is  these are hard times for the expos that this is a way of shoring up their good fortunes i spose suppose  laugh   uh no doubt about that but uh we're you know we're looking at this from a different angle actually  okay that's not your concern  cos one of the things that i would wonder is whether when  when certainly in mid-week games the expos have uh plenty of seats open uh whether you might approach the team for them to donate uh tickets for various organizations as well  uh absolutely  they have agreed uh they already have a plan set up where uh any charitable organization that buys a ticket is donated a couple of dollars uh from the expos x   mmm   so they do receive uh a couple of dollars so the expos are doing already quite a lot in that regard they have been for years and uh and they have their their own foundation set up  through bronfman charity foundation that uh issues tickets to  kids' organizations so what we're doing is a little different in that we're a asking corporations to buy seats so it's more revenue generating  and what s what stage are uh are things at right now  have you got companies on board at this point  uh at the moment it's word of mouth uh my own contacts that i have uh  there are a lot of uhm people out there volunteers and so on that that are spreading the word around  but we hope that the uhm th the  widespread publicity that we hope to generate anyway will  will get the word out and our message and our concept out to the corporations  have you uh got special co-operation from the team as well when you mentioned the business of of flashing things up on the board uhm it it suggests that you've got the team on board for this  yes i do uh expo owner claude brochu uh responded very favourably uh to it and uh he's given me uh his full support in that uh you know for your for publicity uh in the score  scoreboard on the scoreboard and uh as well  there are there are uh media logos that uh could be used for upcoming promotions and special events uh maybe not this year but certainly next year and we are looking to get it started this year at least uh  sort of a dry run test pilot this year to see what kinds of  objections we come up with but it's full-fledged we hope to have it in operation full-fledged next y-  next season   mmm   okay what brought you to this project  are you just a big baseball fan or what was your interest in doing this  well uhm i was having a haircut one day actually and i asked the hairdresser if uh he was a baseball fan and his answer was that he really didn't care much for it didn't really understand it all that much uh the game was too slow for him et cetera he probably would never go to a game  but what was strange is he still has a very vivid and fond memory of the great time he had as a as a   boy scout when he went uh to an expos game with a group of uh other boy scouts  and they all brought their gloves and they sat in the furthest seats and he still talks about that and he goes that was the time of my life   so that was when i started to realize that you know this game is uh is very much uh a kid's game and we should remember that  as a kid mmm   and do you would you have certain charitable organizations that you that you've  already linked up with or non-profit organizations or or  how would you tap into those those kids  who who could benefit from going to a baseball game  well uhm we uh we hope to approach uhm a couple of uh  we're we're specifically looking at the underprivileged youth here in montreal so we'll probably go after ah ah some of the bigger names that that everyone knows them  but wh star teens for example  but we haven't approached anybody yet we are right now at the stage of uh of getting the media to get on board  star teens   well we've done our bit laugh   yes you have and thank you very much  okay s well good luck with this it's  certainly a very uh noble effort on your part  thanks   i appreciate it  thank you for giving us uh the airtime  no sweat  i i've been speaking with  john keenan he's coordinator of take me out to the ball game  and that's a programme that hopes to get  or aims to get underprivileged kids out to see the expos   well no one wants to think about dying but preparing for that eventually ah eventuality i should say  certainly saves a family and friends a lot of confusion and frustration  people who prepare a proper will tend to minimize the conflicts that can arise after their death and sometimes split up families  joining me now to talk about what people should know before writing a will is georges arnaud   he's a lawyer who specializes in estate tax planning  good morning  good morning  now i i think for most of us  particularly if we're young we're thinking that this is something way off on the horizon  um at what point should we consider writing up a will  well i think the first thing to do is to uh make a global inventory of the assets that you might leave after death   because today as the law is working in taxes uh with the estate   is uh is the following french speaker   they would take for granted that the day before your death you would have sold all of your assets  that is called the deemed disposition  and it's the uh it's the sanction from the income tax law  it's both for federal and provincial tax law  so what you have to take into consideration is the kind of assets that you are leaving   ah if i could take the example of the r s ps retirement savings plan for example uhm the r s p would be ah would be  deemed to be disposed of which means that it's like if today you were withdrawing all of your word   gee  so what it means is that this would be considered as a salary and it would be added to all other incomes during the same year  so if someone leaves like i don't know like for example an hundred thousand dollars speaker doesn't say 'one' of r s ps or pension plan or both ah that would be considered as being income plus what what has been earned during the same year  so word   and   so you're saying that even if someone's young  they may they may have more of an estate than they think of because we're not thinking about things like r s ps   yeah sure  i mean uh you could have like uh pension or sometimes you know people would be uh would be uh leaving a company and would have some kind of compensation and that could be roll-overed  not "" rolled over"" into the r s ps  mmm  so it it brings a lot of money at the end  so that that could be taxable at least at fifty percent  so meaning that's fifty thousand dollars goes to the government and the other portion to whoever is concerned  unless you have prop proper  provision in your will for that like   th th   now how just how proper do you have to be in drawing up a will  i mean you hear of people making sort of scribbled notes on paper  uhm what sort of document is considered a will   well any written document uh draft by the person itself  like i if you   you have like three kind of will that could be uh drafted  you have the autographed will which is a will that could be drafted by the person  you don't need any witnesses for that  it has to be dated and signed and all with the handwriting of the person  and then i spose suppose you should let somebody know that you've done this  well it's preferable because otherwise it could be lost or it could be thrown away and nobody would know  so that's the difficulty with that kind of will  the other two kinds of will that you can have is the ah notorial will which is well-known in quebec   but it's only for quebec  you draw it up with a notary then  that's right  and the other uh the other kind of will would be uh drafted and acknowledged by two witnesses  this is the england form of will  which is the uh most frequent in all of the provinces and even in the states  hmm  uh that's actually the the kind of will that we are drafting with the with the  lawyers here   >ah word okay     now i i know that lately i did up a will because i i now have young children and so even if i don't consider myself a weathly person laugh   wealthy person i wanted to uhm look after their care and maintenance  i spose suppose that's another aspect that people m they wanna want to consider  you're not just talking about what you want done with your goods after you leave but also perhaps the care of your children  yeah exactly  you see uh not only do you have to ah to know  what kind of assets that you have but you also have to know  what kind of protection you wanna want to leave for the beneficiaries  if i take the example uh of your your  children for example   you could have like a trust created in your will so that the money will be administered till they reach a certain age under which they should receive all of the assets or a portion of the assets  uh you have two aspects in it   you have a protection against themselves and you also have a protection in term of access also  so you have like two benefits to create that kind of uh  of trust that word   you say protecting against themselves making sure they  won't don't burn through all their money  by between age eighteen and twenty sort of  thing   exactly yeah sure   okay   uhm what are the kinds of things that people often forget  to consi to to look at  when drawing up a will  well mostly it's the it's to  consider the uhm the kind of taxes that they would have because they don't know the specificities  in in term of taxes  hmm   whether there's a difference if you leave it to your spouse or your children for example hmm     that's right   okay because sometimes you wanna want to   leave a portion to x and a portion to y but it might be preferable to go by a certain way or give certain specific assets to a certain person because that would be tax free and the in the  other case it wouldn't be   so you have to think about that "
Canada	 hi  hi mikee how are you laugh   fine  let's go back twenty-nine years if you if you   don't mind and talk about nineteen sixty-five and what made you decide to become a volunteer at the queen e  well i i told the other day and i said i had three teenagers at the time and i wanted to get out and do something that was for me for my just personally for me  laugh   not involved with anybody else  i wa didn't want to be somebody's mother sister brother mother anything laugh   you wanted to be jerry anderson   that's it  so that was my chance  now uh bu but why a why a hospital  some people would would cringe at the thought  there's so much work to be done but uh there are a lot of things you might not want to see  oh well i think uh  i like people very much and uh uh i worked first of all in five east which was a medical floor with many older people and uh  i was pretty good with older people at this   and uh uh now that i'm older i have to  i i'm glad because laugh maybe somebody's going to be good to me  now now what what  what are your duties  i uh i work uh two shifts two days  i work at the information desk uh which i have been at for twenty-four years  mhm  and i work in the admitting office on mondays  and i've been working there for about ten twelve years  before that i i only gave them one day and i was teaching helping in a school  i was teaching children to read  and when that school closed i decided to give the other day back to it  you get another day for them  sure  now you've been around twenty-nine years and i know there are many of your uh colleagues there volunteers who've been there for a number of years too  why do you think people stay around the queen e so much  because it's the best hospital in the city  well that's a simple answer laugh   they have uh it's the community is uh it needs  the community needs it   and uh people are treated like people there  you're not a number  mhm  you're a person  everybody is your friend there  yeah so i guess neighbourhood hospital is a good way to describe it isn't it  oh i think so  yeah in attitude as well  uh you know in there they treat everybody uh the same and uh from the highest uh doctor down to the lowest person everybody is equal uhm  they greet one another like friends and uh  do you know everybody by by their first name  i know a lot laugh   i know a lot laugh   it's a hundred years old  is it it's this year the hundredth anniversary right  that's right  we we've been having celebrations  our volunteer week we had three days of wonderful celebrations  and uh it was uh really uh inspiring to see that we have three hundred volunteers now  boy that is quite a size  and the they do all kinds of jobs which which is saving the government money  mhm laugh get your pitch in there jerry   yeah sure  you're going to have to do a lot of this  uh now you've been around for almost a third of that time  that's right  you must you must know just about well i we we've talked about you knowing everybody  you must about know about everything that goes on in the hospital  all the secrets  well i know  yeah laugh all the secrets yeah  well uhm we're very proud of our hospital and like especially like we have our new emergency which is only eighteen months old and it's just state of the art  it's a wonderful place with a wonderful triage centre  and uh it doesn't uh lose anything to any of the big hospitals  i think we have the best emergency in the city  hmmm  is everybody like you uh over there jerry   oh yes we're all very uh  enthusiastic   up very very up on hospital because it's   we think that it really does a good job in the community  and uh it would be a shame to close it  after all we are the government has  just given us money uh and the go-ahead to have a cat scan  as we speak the uh this construction is going on  and now this is going to go by the boards  i can't see it  well tell me about morale then when you heard about this  first of all i guess it was a kind of a stunned uh more a silence  everybody was like it can't be you know because  they've just remodelled all the hospital and uh it's uh it's  beautiful  yeah   and uh we know that we do such great work in the community that you just couldn't figure we'd be one of the ones that were slated  and especially too we need an english speak   although we have many many french people now  i think i uh i'm using my french  i'm not perfectly bilingual by any means but i have as many french people coming as english now  and uh it's very much needed in the west end you know <[and uh  that's right yeah   and uh closing all the west end ones seems to me uhm i think maybe uh the government might listen  uh   so are people are people  uh ready for uh to get a little frisky about this and  oh i think so  i think we'll get lots of  we have three hundred volunteers that could be out there with petitions and we have all our wonderful staff that will be out there  because they all love the place  and uh your it's really uh i can't say enough about it how the care that they give  now you want to keep the hospital open for another reason  right  oh sure for jerry anderson to  to have a place to go to work laugh uh  laugh but also what happens next year  you get thirty years right  yeah well i if they close it before the spring i won't get my thirty year plaque and i mean i'll be i'll be billing the government for that i guess  well they should tell the premier that  laugh   i'm sure that'll he'll take that into account  your enthusiasm is absolutely infectious  i i gather uh uh each volunteer passes that along to to the others working with them  yeah well i think the government i they should take into consideration we have a wonderful cancer care program  our family medicine unit has a in   well the people from the general came to our hospital for it  to join our family medicine  and uh we have a  people can even get appointments in the evening there  it doesn't have to be if you're a worker that can't get away in the day to see the doctor  there's doctors in the evening there  well jerry i hope it works out for you  oh i hope so too mike and  and   and and maybe we will call you next year and we'll talk to you sitting beside your plaque  who knows  oh good good i hope so  good luck  and thanks for calling  okay  keep your keep up your optismism  oh i will   hi how ya you holding up  hi i'm doing great  you are  you're bang on  the flowers the rings the photography   have you got the pattern yet  for the for the   uh i have the

we're meeting with the person for the video next week as well  oh yeah that's right  it's a video th uh thing now isn't it  we're doing a little bit of everything actually  we want to have the photographs and the video  cos we have a lot of uh people in the family who are a little bit older  and it'd be nice to get them on video and maybe even make one for them  yeah   now have you got patterns for cutlery and plates and things like that for gifts that uh that you that you want   oh no we're not there yet laugh   oh sorry i just  i just brought something up i shouldn't have right   laugh   oh please   you've got enough details  that's uh that's something that we're going to be looking at i'd say within the next week and a half or so  right now basically what we've done is we've gotten out the invitations  and i've managed to uh handwrite them with calligraphy for a  i've written about sixty-five so far  cos we have uh i have a fairly big family on my side  and i've there it's half scottish and half french and uh  so getting out the invitations was something else because it's a huge family  how many more have you got  uhm we're gonna going to end up with about a hundred and fifty people at about nine o'clock  cos what we're doing is we're having people over for the reception  you you you're  making out a hundred and fifty invitations by hand  no i'm making out sixty-five by hand  yeah  which are for the people showing up at the reception  and then i'm making out uh invitations where actually i've been putting sticky labels on uh  laugh   for for our friends that will be showing up at nine o'clock  why why would you want to do it by hand  haven't you got enough to do  i have a lot to do but it's  the invitations themselves are very special  yeah i realize yeah   we went   we went to vermont and we found a man who makes handmade paper  mmm hmm  and we bought the handmade paper for from  him and uh made the insides ourselves  actually my fiance made the the you know where it has the the description of the wedding and where it is and the reception at the bottom  but are you up all night writing this stuff  pretty much yes  and thinking i don't even like this person  why am iinviting him or her  wrong  no   i'm inviting the people i want to invite   oh good for you   oh yeah   cos that doesn't often happen you know  i know  that's true  actually i'm i'm lucky  we've decided it's our wedding  and it's nice for people to have their say and we'll listen to them  but it is our wedding so  but the the list has expanded  you said you said before you originally had thirty-five right  yes actually  it was all planned out for thirty-five  we had chosen the uh  it was going to be in a restaurant  it was going to be something very small  um hum  and then what happened was uhm we actually told everybody  well told my grandmother and henry's mom and my gran  my great-aunt at easter  mmm hmm  that's when we started announcing it  and uh my grandmother said oh well you have aunts and uncles that you need to invite because they invited you to their wedding  and she's right and it would be nice to have them there so  we said well granny this is our budget laugh   we're doing this on this budget  so granny said well okay let me help you out a little bit and that way we can invite them  okay so you're happy for that helth help    you don't find it an intrusion  no not at all not at all  uhm at one point   or granny's listening on the radio laugh  and you can't tell me right now laugh   i  uhm it wasn't an intrusion at all   actually it's nice to have my uncles and aunts there because you know you only see them so often  yeah   now i don't wanna want to be  i don't wanna want to be a trouble maker but have there been tensions 
Canada	 i mean there there usually are   with with you know not not  only your parents but there are in-laws and everybody wants to make it nice but everybody has there own idea about what nice is  have have there been tensions <  i would lie if i said no  okay  uh there have been because everbody wants to have their say  have you ever taken a swing at anybody  no laugh   oh okay  well that's good then  you're ahead of the game   not yet anyway laugh   laugh yeah well call if you do  we'd love to hear about it  laugh   no actually it's been pretty civil uh  the only thing is we're having a wedding on a friday which uh is something else for a lot of people  because i have a lot of   oh i betcha bet you your grandmother didn't like that   no  my grandmother's quite religious and it you know  it has to be on a saturday  if it's not on a saturday then you know there's something wrong  but uh she's come around  and now it's uh  she's come she's liking the idea of having it on a friday night and  in fact it's going to be the thirtieth of june which turns into the first of july so  it's going to be one big party  mmm hmm  and you're you're having it at the fort matthew club  what a nice choice  mmm hmm  i'm actually i'm very lucky because when we had thirty-five people henry and i had chosen the place  and then when we  actually it actually increased to seventy people  and uh we looked at each other and said oh my god we're not going to go through you know looking through a place again  um hum  so we uhm called up marriage &agrave; la carte  and i spoke to anne   and we went in and we sat down with her  and she was great because she told us exactly   this is your this is your wedding coordinator right   you bet   you bet   that's basically what she does   yeah   and we sat down with her and uh she told us exactly what she did  and she disappeared for about two minutes  we looked at each other  we said yes definitely  so that night we gave her a cheque a deposit and away we went and she found us a place  boy that that's amaz   of course these people are calming earthquakes right  laugh   her face probably didn't even change at all when you told her about the the what  you were up against  oh no  she's great  yeah  oh yeah  and she has  she knows the details down pat  are you enjoying this  yes i am  i am  there's a lot of work to be done but i'm enjoying it very much  yeah  no scary moments eh   yeah   uhm  scary moments i think that'll be the day when it comes where actually the uh  we're we're going to be doing it a day beforehand  going through everything at the church  and uh i think i'll be a little bit scared that day  i'll tell you what one bit of advice  the only bit i can give  mmm hmm  don't watch four weddings and a funeral the night before  laugh   alright you just  you won't go through it if you watch that film  okay   okay  ah could we could we talk to you every once in a while  and get a bit of a diary from you as the  as the day gets closer  sure   sure sounds good  and if i'm really nice i might get an invitation to the wedding right  laugh   good to talk to you sandra   thank you very much  good luck to you  thank you  bye  bye   hi welcome home  it's good to be back  tell me about the new album because it really is a departure  yonder tree is not the gino vinelli montrealers have come to know and love over the last twenty years  no it uh well not typically but you know it's something i've been aching to do for the last twenty years  to put an acoustic jazz band together and to uh to  sort of uhm record a genre of music that i was  that i grew up with   uh you know some artists have done it  carly simon and harry connick and natalie cole  and i appreciate that but i i wanted to do something that was perhaps in that genre but but   create new material new lyrics new thoughts  so don't make it a nostalgia album  it it's not a nostalgia album   at all   yeah   it's just uh  it relates or perhaps is influenced by an era of music but it's not really that era at all  tell me about some of the influences you did grow up with  some of the singers you uh you were very fond of and   and wanted to recreate what what  you'd been hearing for so many years  well my my dad was the person who was the liason between the jazz and the big band area era    and and in my generation  he introduced me to the likes of all the croon singers  of of the time including tony bennett and sinatra and  and a plethora of those kinds of singers  and and uh also the joe williams and the sarah vaughns and the ella fitzgeralds  and uh also the big bands and and the quartets the quintets the dave brubecks the uh coltranes and miles davis so on and so forth  so i was really pretty well inun inundated   with uh a lot of that that kind of music  so it was in my blood and it really stirred me because it was always challenging to play and challenging to really appreciate  uhm  tell me about the pieces falling into place to make the album happen after all these years of having it ruminate up here  well you have to you have to make a place for art  art doesn't happen on its own  you have to clear the path with a machete  especially if you want to especially if you want to get it out there to the public  it has to be a conscious effort where you have to court the muse  within yourself   mmm hmm   and you also have to court the muses of of  manufacturing  so you get yourself a position where you have enough of perhaps commercial success or enough of a name or enough credibility  and then you take the shot and say i need to do what i need to do  and lo and behold because you're courting the muse at the right time all the doors open for you and you're you're   it's as if heaven opens the door for you to say go ahead  hmm  do what you need to do  geez was there was there one defining moment when this happened to you  eh can you think of a   well eh   i think uh a growing feeling of malaise within myself  a feeling of aching boredom with with   uh popular music and that it was very repetitive  and i needed to to stretch myself to challenge myself both lyrically and vocally and  and put a real good jazz group together and uh  i went up to portland and i did uh i did   just that  and it was a hell of a time  i felt like a kid again  yeah  yeah  was it a little scary walking into the studio the first time  well yeah  i built my own studio up in portland   yeah   so ah  but i mean with a with a new experience  the sense you had word   oh i was so convinced  yeah  i was so convinced that i was doing was what i had to be doing  what i wanted to be doing  hmm  cos i was gonna going to ask you about shifting gears uh in the type of music you would be recording and whether that would be   well i shifted gears uh psychologically emotionally maybe a good five or six years ago  uhm hmm  after the recording of the last album uh the inconsolable man album  yeah  i i just didn't really want to record pop albums anymore  i just had no interest  and i i turned thirty-eight thirty-nine at the time and  part of part of it is just you know biological  maybe it's a midlife music crisis  i don't know  but uh i'm not uhm different from any other man who's   who's asked himself the same questions at late thirties or early forties  and so i started really realizing you know the uh the terrific uh finiteness to everything  and i said well if i'm gonna going to  do what i really wanna want to i've gotta  got to get to it  hmm  and that was it  times yeah you're getting to that that   halfway point where uh  yeah  yeah  and and then i uh  i'm enjoying it thoroughly because it's again it's a challenge for me and to to broaden myself harmonically uh rhythmically vocally lyrically and uh  i can't think of a better medium to do it in  tell me about uh the the uh the atmosphere in studio  uh you said yourself you didn't want to create a nostalgia album  in the uh you know natalie cole did  no not at all   albeit a really wonderful album   ah it was great  i agree yes   it's a great album but it was a nostalgia album  yes  tell me about the attitude and the the   sense of uh atmosphere you wanted to create in the studio with  with uh a classic jazz album   well you get   well you get musicians who are aware of that era of music that can play you know the miles classics and and all the classics written by cole porter and so on and so forth  and the guys who can go the modal way like coltrane did in love supreme  and guys who are very advanced you know musically  but then you get the same guys who are very well aware of pop music and who have a pop sensibility because they're younger people who grew up with the beatles and so on and so forth as we did  so that combination's a very very difficult combination to find but when you do find uh you find it you can find some real magic because you know exactly how to to  take and leave what's been done before  and to change it and twist it  and to redefine it  and to re-colour it  and this is precisely what we aim to do on on  this album  for instance walter whitman is a song that has is  from a genre of music with with the sweeping brushes and some of the chord changes  but i twisted some of the chord changes and  and put em them in another   on another level other than just a uh you know crooning ballad  and lyrically i decided to make you know the uh what would be easily a swoon song about you know a love affair  i didn't want to fall to such you know clich&eacute;s  i i wanted to write you know about one of my favourite poets that ever lived and his name is walt whitman  uhm hmm  and i was going through also a spiritual or emotional crisis with my belief system and my what i what i had faith or lost faith in  and i found him to be you know very comforting  and i found him to be one of the anchors that i anchored to in that time period  so i figured what better person what better topic  to write about  so in that sense taking what's already there and  and twisting it and letting it bloom and letting it go to different places this is what this album's all about  tell me about working with your brother joe  you guys work very closely together  he is your producer and matter of fact your brother ross is  working with you as well  but tell me tell me about your relationship with with joe and recording and   working in the studio   well this job is a little bit different because i moved to portland oregon and joe decided to stay in  los angeles   yeah   uhm hmm   so i took care of of most of the production on this album  and it was a little bit uh scary for me because i   i was used to being with joe  but it ended up being that joe worked a lot on the album anyway  so he he worked uh  he did a lot of the overdubs with me and uh  he was there when i did a couple of vocals  and and we mixed it together  so you know the only difference was i had to pay him up front that's all laugh   laugh 
Canada	 well it sounds like your brother upfront  laugh   uhm  but but that that   sense of control that you had in producing yourself felt good in the in the final product  or or would you rather not do it again   well i've always   i've always pretty well you know produced myself   with with my brother helping me  yeah   but i i really relied upon uh some other people uhm to help me through it  uh i hired a vocal coach to help me through some of the vocals  harry mccormack and uh  like i said my brother joe was with me when i did a lot of the overdubs uh  i relied a lot on the musicians you know to uh  to be playing certain things and for me to be able to catch them in moments  hmm  so it wasn't like i was there alone with a midi machine and a computer  yeah  trying to do it all myself  uhm hmm  tell me about the vocal coach  that that inter  interests me because phrasing is crucial in this genre of singing   it is   it is  it's  what i found out  what i was   people call sinatra a genius well   that's right  that's right and you know it's your timing and how much you sing or don't sing is very crucial to songs as such  and harry mccormack was uh  i had a couple of problems with some songs uhm to get through them  cos i wasn't sure where to inflect my voice  i i was seeming to over blow it  i used too much voice too much passion to the point where i was just killing it  and then i'd go back the other way and it was too flaccid  so he he really got me through it  word   one of them was i die a little more each day  it was a very difficult song to sing because of the content of the lyric  each line  i mean how do you sing the black drums leaking in their graves   remainder of song lyric   it's very difficult to sing that  carried away emotionally if you   yeah you can get  yeah   you know   so you're tending you tend to want to pull back but  he came up with a lot of good uhm good hints  he told me every line has to have its own colour  because the melody is somewhat repetitive and the things that's really changing the colour are the lyrics so you have to go with the lyric  and we just horsed around in the studio and and  uh his his attention to  to detail really paid off  is is it a matter of concentration too  well it's also a matter of paying attention  and a matter of getting in tune with what you're really trying to say  yeah  i wrote die a little more each day two three years ago  and i believe if i would have done a vocal right there i probably would have had it  but after three years i forgot what the   i forgot to tap into that emotion  uhm   i didn't know what it was anymore  and uh i knew this this nice lyric here was written  and it was time to do a vocal  but uh i i couldn't get into the emotion   that immediacy   exactly   yeah   and then and then finally going into it and into it and into it  i remember when i finally got the vocal  i tapped into it and i felt it again  my heart started palpitating and i started feeling like i really feel this pain  and i really do feel that because these things are done to ourselves and to earth and so on and so forth i i  really do feel the ache  hmm  and then the vocal started coming alive  ironically it must be a great feeling though to  capture capture that that  feeling again remembering what it was like laugh   it is   oh yeah it is  yeah  that is the danger sometimes of living with a song for more than a couple of years  tell me about the show coming up at the spectrum  montrealers are going to see a different uh gino vinelli  yeah   now this is exciting  it's the first night of the jazz festival  yeah  well you know i i wouldn't consider myself a a artist  in fact jazz is a very difficult word  to to really define but  it's it's more of what we know as a jazz band  uh i'm only gonna going to be  it's it's gonna going to be different  we're going to we're going to have a trio  we're going to have a a piano player a vibist and a an upright bass  and we'll have various guests from the jazz festival  and it'll be uh  can you tell me who they are yet  well we're we're talking to a   a few of them   and uh they'll they'll be classics  oh okay   i guarantee you that  uh  cos i know joe williams is coming this year  interesting  well it's a question of working out the timing  yeah laugh all right  but uh it'll be a a night  basically where i'm i think i'd like to communicate to people on a different level than i have in the past  on a very personal level  i like em them to sing the   to sing the melodies to show them the melodies without much production at all  and for them to sing along and to and to   see some of the or hear some of the changes i've been through as a person or as someone they've maybe followed for a few years  and to see if it mirrors their lives  and to make it a lot more uhm naked than it's ever been  do you rush to embrace that feeling of the way you're  you're going to be out there on stage   yeah   cos it's a lot different from studio isn't it  it is  but you know i uh  in the last uh couple of months i've actually been with uh a couple of musicians and we've done this over some cities in the united states and it's been a hell of a lot of fun  tell me about uh the tap dancing in uhm in  fallen in love  that's not you obviously  no no it's gregory hines   the great gregory hines   how'd you get him to do that  i just asked him laugh   oh and he said <yeah sure   yeah   yeah  well he wanted to hear the tape  and i said uhm  well what it came about in the studio  and it was it was originally a drum solo  and because we were trying to think of unique ideas uh i said to myself uh  someone mentioned that it reminded them of a fred astaire type track  something you know a modernized thirties or forties song  i said uhm how about a tap solo  i said well who better gregory hines  so i got my manager to call his agent  and uh his agent gave us his his home number  i called him and i said it was me and i said would you like to do a tap solo  and he said send me a tape  i sent him a tape  he called me the next day and said you bet laugh   all right  and so we uh  i went to l a cos he was going to be in l a in a few weeks  from that time  and uh we joe and i built him a  uh a stage  two four by eight plywoods nailed together on two by fours  threw a little sand on it  put a couple of mics microphones and said go gregory laugh   laugh   must have been fun to watch  it was  we had we filmed it  it was fun  well thanks a lot for coming in  welcome home back home and uh  looking forward to seeing you uh at the jazz festival  my pleasure   well for the past few summers montrealers have been strapping on the wheels and taking off to the nearest bike path or park  rollerblading  in-line skating if you like  it's getting more and more popular every year  as you probably heard last week the city of montreal loosened its rules just a little  blades are now allowed on bike paths and in some parks  today we're going to talk about safety etiquette and of course  paramount we're going to talk about fun  ben uh feinstein is a blader  he also owns a store that sells rollerblades and he joins me in the studio now  hi  welcome to the program  thanks  it's also changed the sound of street hockey too  massively yes   yeah irreparably   because my my uh sound of street hockey is the sound of boots or running shoes clapping against the sidewalk  now of course it's the sound of  sound of bearings that need greasing   yeah yeah exactly laugh   all the kids on my block if it's street hockey uh   they are playing they are playing on rollerblades  yeah i'm doing the same thing  i've got a bunch of friends who uh all converted the same way  we play in a local school yard  oh do ya you   yeah   yup   and uh there's the sound of scraping knees too occasionally  and the occasional yelp but that's about it  are shin guards essential  uh not essential  it depends how you're playing  it's the same thing with shinny when you're playing hockey in winter  yeah you're gonna going to get knocked down anyway  yeah  is it is it   i'm sure it's not just me who's noticing this but it seems to be a quantum leap in the number of people roller roller blading  each year  i was out at the old port and my gosh they're everywhere  yup  it's seems like in montreal over the past couple of years it's almost doubled  the the sales year to year have been twice as great as they were the year before  that much eh  so yeah even last summer you're looking at a thirty percent increase in the number of people on the streets who are blading and they're anticipating the same thing if not more for this summer so  holy mackerel  yeah  and how qui what are the age groups    i mean uh i'm i'm seeing uh uh uh  actually i'm seeing all ages  yeah  is there an age group where it's it's   most popular  well our store tends to uh focus on the freestyle aspect  we've got a lot of teenagers who come into our store for snowboards and stuff  uhm hmm  and our focus uh actually has gone a lot broader because the sport hits everyone  i've got my daughter on blades myself and   how old is she   she's uh four years old and i   how do you get blades that small   can you  they've got em them they got   em them   they come with two sizes uh two size booties for the insides  they'll last longer stuff like that  and my father actually is the person i've longest known to be a blader or uh in-line skater and he's been doing it for at least fifteen years now  something like that   really   he bought his blades way back in the seventies  seventy-eight seventy-nine   well i'm not gonna going to be    that is a long he's a real pioneer isn't he    i'm not gonna going to be indelicate and ask how old he is but uh needless to say uh he's not a kid   he's a he's a   sex sexagenarian or something like that  i don't know what laugh   he's been around for a few decades  yeah  what does he love so much about it  uh i think he likes the exercise the smoothness of it the less impact uh related problems the knees and back than running   than running yeah uhm hmm   and you go faster  it's just the thrill of a little bit of speed without you know  unlike a bike you don't need miles and miles to go  a couple of miles and you get a good workout but you get the sensation of going a little bit faster than you are with your when you're walking  yeah   and the whole feeling really the essence of it that   i it struck me last summer was the idea of being able to  imagine this is like to me a quebec dream  the streets freeze but it's warm and you can use your skates all summer long and go anywhere and  so they are they really are a natural extension of us  oh yeah   aren't they yeah 
Canada	   also you have to consider what kind of income the beneficiary will have at at the time of your death  so you can figure out what kind of cash money you wanna  want to leave them and what could be locked into ah a trust or some somewhere else you know  so what you have to be careful about uh most of the time is  to the uh to make a proper roll over of the r s p  that is the first main thing to do  complicated stuff  yeah it is  what what about a living will  does that have to be drawn up separately  actually the living will is drafted along with the mandate in case of incapacity   uh it doesn't go with the will because the will would only take effect if you died   so the living will is like for the period a little before that time  so that can be it is recognized  as as having a legal impact or legal value but  it it has to be in a separate document  mmm   hmm hmm   okay  ha have you encountered some nightmarish stories in your business about when people don't make these kinds of careful provisions  oh yeah a lot  actually i could give you an example in which they had a will yes  they'd uh was uh was like given to  uh to the wife  that was mainly it  it was what we call a universal legacy you know like i give and bequeath all my uh my uh assets  to my wife for example okay   yeah   just in one general chunk  okay   but they called they called us uh four months after the time of death and they didn't do the transfer of the r s p to the wife because the will did not specified that the r s ps were to be roll-overed not 'rolled-over' to the wife  hmm  so what they had to do then  ah they could have done otherwise but since they called like only four months after the death ah they had unregistered all of the r s ps so they had to pay forty five thousand dollars in taxes   that they could have avoided otherwise  yeah mm   mmm   well that's quite a warning  thank you very much  you're welcome  georges arnaud is a lawyer who specializes in estate tax planning drawing up wills and such   it's just sixteen minutes now before eight o'clock here on daybreak  well you've seen them in the gym before their faces are scrunched up in pain and they're dripping with sweat they're obsessed with counting reps and sets and they rush to book their time on the stairmaster  for these people exercise is a science  it's about burning fat and developing that perfect body but montreal sports psychologist tim savage says they're taking the wrong approach  he's written a book called the exercise habit and he says exercise not only gets us in shape physically but also mentally  he joins me now  good morning  mr savage are you there  oh! hang on  we'll get back to mr savage in just a moment  ah first we'll just take a look at uhm the uh  this will help us mentally and ev even  physically if you're gonna going to be going out there jogging  take a look at the fine weather picture we have today   well i spoke a little earlier about those people in pain dripping as they exercise in the gym  and uh word montreal sports psychologist  tim savage who says that's that's the wrong approach  don't think about calories and building the perfect body  he's written a book called the exercise habit and uh talks about as much uh the importance of getting mentally fit as physically fit  and he joins me now  good morning mr savage   good morning alana   ahh so what does exercise do for us mentally  well i think that it exercise is no different from many of the other things that we do in life that it has all of the potential for satisfying a wide variety of our needs including the need for uh sociability meaning playfulness ah challenge competition et cetera  and uh i think that one of the the  major problems i see with the exercise world as it exists today is that it is too narrowly focused on uh body motives that uh we look at it as something that we take on in order to change our bodies or to perhaps deal with a health problem but i think that uh for a lot of people it   it has to do with uh attaining some ideal physical shape or losing weight and as such it becomes uhm a limited uh application of exercise where people will uh try to put their mind into neutral or distract themselves by reading or talking to someone  it's just something to get over get over  with as soon as possible sort of  get through the pain  yeah oh oh i mean it it's   horrible  i work out at a a gym where i listen to people in the locker room and i remember one fellow saying ah you know i i come here every day and i hate it  laugh and but i  ha i have to do it   and i think wow what an attitude  and what are you building into your experience by every day doing something for about an hour that you hate  and and you can see that reflected in the rest of his  attitude  i think that what we need to do is to look at exercise as something that we're making a lifelong commitment to  and that it will affect us in ah our mind and our body our spirits  and and to try to build it in more holistically rather than focus it as something that is only going to work on our fat cells or develop m uh muscle tone  that that it can give us so much more  it can uh help to develop a sense of challenge in our lives  it can uh introduce an element of fun and excitement  it can uh bring a certin kind of expressivity into how we live our lives  i it can uh enable us to feel more centered more powerful in ourselves and to look at it in terms  of of how it will help us to attain the  the aspects or dimensions of our lives that we develop in ourselves and not  just look to look at it   as a as a physical thing  how horrible that   hmm   broader hmm   hmm mmm i imagine you get less discouraged and less likely to drop off an exercise programme when you don't look at it on  along those narrow lines as well  well i i think that what happens is that someone engages in an exercise programme with the goal of losing five pounds or ten pounds and uhm it's like the yo-yo diet it's   the the yo-yo exercise plan where people will  exercise for a while and quit and uh then exercise again  and it and it becomes very aversive because if each time you uh enter an exercise uh programme you do it with an attitude of i hate this or this is drudgery  then it it isn't going to last and we really need to incorporate in our lives a lifelong plan not just something that is going to be a quick fix for an immediate problem  hmm   so how do we make it more pleasant  is it a matter of choosing the right exercise  it it's partly choosing the right exercise bu and the right exercise will change from from time to time from year to year depending on on what your needs are  i think it's really useful to have a a   kinda kind of like a bag of tricks a bag of exercises that that you know and that you can do  and uh depending on your mood depending on your needs at that particular time you may go running you may go swimming you may b  play a game of volleyball  you may just go for a walk you may do yoga you may do tai chi  and all of the different exercise forms uh will cater to different needs that you have  the other thing i think which is even far more important than that is to broaden our notion of what exercise is  that exercise is something that has become uhm so narrowly defined as this this ritualistic activity that we do   w   yeah and and with our special outfits  and and it's crazy because uhm exercise really has to do with the expenditure of of effort  and and we can do that in so many ways  and if we take it out of the gym if we take it out of these narrow confines then what it allows us to do is to see all of the opportunities that we have for movement  my father-in-law is a wonderful example  he will go to an exercise class but when uhm his wife asks him uh to go for a walk he won't go for a walk because she likes to walk around and just look at things and stop and talk to people  and for him that's that's   not exercise laugh yeah and  and uh he'll uh he'll get up and he'll do push-ups uhm he'll do all sorts of things that are very ritualistic but in terms of just going out and and pushing the lawnmower around the lawn no he hires someone to do that  and and i think that we need to  bring back into our lives those things that labour-saving devices have have removed from our lives to to uh incorporate activities that are just uhm uh word  yeah  sweating on the machine kind of thing   it's not goal-oriented enough for him   that's just wandering   incidentally exercise yeah   well thank you very much mr savage   an interesting perspective  you're welcome  tim savage is a montreal sports psychologist who has written a book called the exercise habit  it's just seven minutes now before eight o'clock on daybreak  music   the forty-three canadian peacekeepers removed from their observation posts in a battle zone in croatia are safely back at their base  the soldiers are part of the seven hundred and sixty member   contin canadian contingent based in rastovic  they were moved from their posts friday by croatian soldiers to thirty kilometres away to zadar when it became apparent they were outnumbered and were in a battle zone  lieutenant commander ken watson joins us now uhm with more on this  ah good morning  good morning  tell me what what happened to these soldiers when they were ah removed from their posts and taken to zadar  well ah first of all i have to correct your premise uh  i had some erroneous i information   earlier that said they were returned back to rastovic  in fact they are still in zadar  uh huh  they have not gotten back  what uh happened last night was that we had one of our resupply convoys and some soliders who had been on uh an r and r programme out of the area uh for a little rest and relaxation they were the ones that managed to return uh about one o'clock in the morning our time  the forty-three soldiers are still in zadar  they are staying in a uh croatian barracks uh area being very well treated  they were never ever uh captives in the true sense of the word or prisoners  they were simply uhm uh once uh it was clear that uh the croatians were going to evict them in uh and in the face of uh overwhelming odds they had no choice but to leave  they were simply escorted out of the area uh out of the battle zone area to zadar where they have been uh very very well treated by the croatians and uh  we're simply now negotiating ah an a  time that is mutually convenient really that they can return back to the main base camp in rastovic  how gently were they escorted out of there?  we heard they were taken out by gunpoint?  well the confrontations that occurred in each of the observation posts uh were basically uh soldiers coming up saying okay you have to leave our soldiers saying no not   not a chance we're not leaving and uh at which point the croatians arrived with uh an overwhelming force uh armed with uh rocket-propelled grenades uh uh large numbers of soldiers 
Canada	 it's the quebec culture uh summarized or something like  that   yeah   skating year round  yeah  eh eh are we are well you sell em   them so maybe you do know  i mean do we do more of it here in montreal than we do say in other cities  i mean is it is more of it done here than in say toronto or vancouver  not yet actually  the trends like all trends seem to flow out of california and then on their way go to vancouver first toronto next  and last year toronto had its big boom year according to the industry uh and this year it's montreal  so we're a year behind  but the thing that's different about quebec is the enthusiasm with which it's been taken up  there's a it went from being something like sixteen officially recognized amateur hockey leagues uh or teams  last year to something like two hundred in the province registered  with the association  yeah some enormous amount  i don't know the exact number but it's in the hundreds  uhm hmm   your kidding   yeah  and uh twenty thousand kids participating this year in the leagues  it's really uh it's grown explosively  now now is growth  is there a downside to growth like that with people don't know what they're doing yet  yeah i think so  i think the enthusiasm with the sport uhm just leads to the fact that there's going to be thirty percent new skaters   when you see people skating this year thirty percent of them will never have been on blades before  yeah hmm  they'll be familiar with it from having gone skating uhm on ice  and people tend to learn it very quickly here  be very enthusiastic > words   okay so it's the same physical movement really yeah   same physical movement  the skating going forward is no problem  it's the braking that makes the huge difference  people uh tend not to wear pads because you don't wear pads when you just go skating on ice   yeah   and they don't learn how to brake necessarily or realize how important it is that you must learn how to brake one of the first things  yeah now has has yvan cournoyer's rollerblading team uh uh the roadrunners roller hockey international team  uh have they have they caused this excitement or is it the other way around  i mean are they are they just latching on to a trend do you think  uh part uh i think it's a little bit of both  yeah yeah   they definitely building up the hype about it  and the promotion and advertising that they put together  the very fact that it's yvan cournoyer probably draws a lot of attention to the sport  legitimizes it a lot for kids to want to participate in the summer  uh but other than that and i think it's kind of reciprocal  okay now let's find out if even if  your not involved with with rollerblading uh eh playing hockey  if you want to go out there and get some exercise  city of montreal uh has a new policy  people are not permitted to rollerblade where they are and where they aren't  and uh why don't we save them a few bucks in tickets and find out where they are not allowed to rollerblade  they are on bicycle pa they are allowed on bicycle paths now right  that's correct  i think as of last friday that seems to be the case that  they're allowed to you're allowed to uh do your in-line skating on bicycle paths  any bicycle paths  and you you have as much right as any cyclist there  i think so   from what i understand that's the case  okay and where shouldn't you go  now   uh they don't want you to go downtown more than anything  on busy streets they don't want you to go  they don't want you to go anywhere without proper protection  uhm hmm  uhm you can roll in the parks obviously if you don't but on the street they're definitely  the police if they're going to stop anyone it's someone who's being reckless who's not following uh the regular uh you know street safety rules of just you know giving the right of way to pedestrians   okay   cos technically your not out on the streets at all are ya  technically you're not allowed to according to i think it's quebec law  it would have to be changed and not municipal law that says that rollerblades uh or uh skate uh skateboards roller skates or in-line skates effectively are not allowed on the streets  but uh municipal police know that they can't really do very much in terms of people going on the streets at large  they're going to focus on people who are causing problems more  okay because it sounds to me as if you've got a   a lot of accidents in the making what with the  i mean the the popularity of bicycles in  montreal's montreal has exploded in the last fifteen or twenty year years and we know the complaints uh that we get uh about about cyclists  now you've got the rollerbladers you got the pedestrians you've got obviously the motorists and you've got uh and you've got rolle bladers  it sounds as if it's getting awfully crowded out there  yeah goodness knows what else could fit on the streets  laugh   but what it does   we could move at all   yeah but a couple of things come to mind though  we need more  i think more public access to really good routes in the city would be a nice thing  i mean it's a healthy thing  there's no reason the city shouldn't encourage it in its citizens or that the province shouldn't encourage this kind of athletic participation  people want to use their legs and feet to transport themselves to and from work  we can give them the way to do it safely  we should be promoting that kind of thing rather than inhibiting or prohibiting it because we don't understand or we're afraid of it or we don't have the means  presently to deal with it  hmm   yeah   yeah   now goodness knows we don't need to build up another bureaucratic level but do you think people should get a little training before especially going out on the streets  yah but see actually   you see a lot of people weaving in and out of there who should know better  uh yeah i think that's true but uh it should be mostly coming from the shops  uh people have friends  everyone knows somebody who's roll who's rollerblading   yeah  there're places where you can get lessons if you're not familiar  you should never start off on the streets but go to a place that's flat  a school yard or down to the old port on a slow day not on a saturday or sunday when it's overloaded with people  they you can even ask almost any rollerblader for a little advice and they'd give it to you  uhm hmm   yeah  freely  now uhm at first blush i mean uh the the  the bicycle path sounds like your they sound like your best bet because they can get you uh all over uh town  can you  yeah as far as transportation goes they're your best bet  for recreation and fun though there's a lot of other places to go  okay why why would uh the  the path not necessarily be a recreational choice  of course you can't do much other than go in two directions  that's it uhm for instance this weekend i went uh uh from the mountain jeanne mance park down to the olympic stadium and it was mostly for transportation because the bike path isn't that beautiful in most of its parts along that route  but uh the other thing is that you it's  narrow  so they're not really designed for people on blades  your legs go out side to side  bikes oncoming bike traffic or behind you  you gotta have got to be careful on a  bike path word   you do have to be careful  i yeah now now cyclists uh have uh whether uh it's fair or not have a pretty rough refu reputation in this city  what's what's the etiquette and  what what should you be watching for when you're on the bike paths and you got cyclists coming both ways  you gotta have got to look behind you once in a while  in front of you when you see a bike coming on you just  gotta have got to glide past them without actually uhm skating so that you don't draw your feet out in front of them  it's kind it's commonsensical   then otherwise just make sure you give the right of way to the people ahead of you  it's the same kind of rules as driving or any sport  just if someone can't see you because they're ahead of you they've got the right of way  pedestrians have the right of way and cyclists have to treat the bladers in the same with the same respect i suppose  yeah have have they  i mean are they going to be welcoming out there laugh   building territory   so far i haven't seen a problem   most of the time i get a big smile you know  when people see me blading there not a a   look of curiosity but no animosity no bad words  i haven't heard a single story to that effect really  yeah   okay you mentioned there are better places than the bicycle paths for recreation  where would you go for for fun  sheer fun  uh the old port is great on the weekends   it's just such a jumble of people  there's so many people down there blading  uh the lachine canal's a beautiful path  parc lafontaine is turning into a real hot spot as well  lots of people there and it's a beautiful park though it desperately needs to be repaved if anyone from the city is listening right now laugh   and uh then most of the other municipal parks are really good  any of the paved municipal parks i'd say are the finest places to go  other than that small streets uhm in the suburbs  if you're gonna going to   if you're gonna going to go against  the the provincial law as it stand to go to the quiet streets in the plateau are wonderful  it's a great you see some beautiful architecture  you can explore different neighbourhoods rather quickly  uh old montreal with its cobblestone streets is a place to avoid  yeah yeah   pick a quiet street laugh   yeah   uhm hmm uhm hmm  and the other thing to watch out for is a big warning to anyone who has just gotten blades who does want to maybe venture onto the street is they repair the streets with this gooey tar that fills the cracks in the city and if you're not aware of what you're doing or where you're going and your blades go into one of those you fall over you could really hurt yourself  okay and safety as far as what you should wear  you should have a helmet  helmet definitely  and a bicycle helmet i hear is not good enough  uh no it's not ideal because when you when  beginners or people who are going to fall tend to fall they fall on the backs on their backsides  and the head the back of your head the back of the crown of your head is what's at risk so inline helmets are  should be more like skateboard helmets i e they should cover the back of your head  or if they look like bike helmets they should come down further towards the back of your head  uh kids or anyone should also wear wrist guards  that is the single greatest cause of injuries people not wearing wrist guards  so you're talking more yeah   what if you fall forward uh you uh tend to uh push your hands out and uh hurt your hands   yeah well you're going a little bit   you're going as fast as you are when you're running and suddenly you fall  you catch some of that gooey stuff on the street  down you go and your wrists are the first place to break  uh other than that the uh knee pads are a good thing and especially if you're playing some hockey or something like that  and then elbow pads are a good idea as well  they usually come with most of the protection equipment but   be seem to be less important than the other parts 
Canada	" good morning mister dufour   yeah good morning  last week when we talked to you you seemed to be saying you were a a fou co-founder   of this movement   no   now you're not going to be taking part  what's going on here   i never said i was co-founder   the see lots of things have changed from the time i was invited to the time to what i read in le devoir   the way i look back at it i've i've been used by tillman   and and first of all i wanted to  i want to make it very clear that i have nothing to do with la mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais   i'm only a member  and now looking back at it i can see why they invited me  this guy wanted to make to to  pretend that the mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais was supporting his movement  and that's why he invited me because he knew i   i was a memeber  mister du dufour     now the mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais  has got nothing to do with this and i want it make   i want it to be very clear to everybody  and they are very this has hurt that movement   and they have never supported it  they would never support it either  mister dufour what was it that you  either that you read in le devoir or you've heard mister tillman say since then that  that made you change your mind  word   well the the movement was presented to me as a peaceful movement  as a way to unite sovereigntists not "" sovereignists"" like me who want to speak out when it's time to speak out  but who also want to unite in doing positive things and  and and and see a   as far as i'm concerned it's it was  just about the set-up  like they presented they present it as being peaceful and and it turned out  i'm totally against racism  i'm against uhh violence  i'm against uh using any any ways that is not legal  and and i i  look because when i spoke to you last week i didn't read le devoir   i never heard i was never told of the secret movement  i was never told about any manifesto or anything    but but but   m mister dufour when i spoke to you last week  uhm and and i just listened to the tape again before uhh b before we   before we're talking here uhm i said to you are you one of the founders or you're among the founders and  and you didn't say no then  we went through a number of the elements of the manifesto as reported in le devoir   you said you were generally supportive of the manifesto you were aware of the manifesto  so i i don't quite understand this morning you're saying you didn't have knowledge of it  well i was aware of the things they wanted to s  stand for  now there is positive things in there which i agree with  but i sure when i talked to you i didn't see i didn't have that man manifesto  or what what was it what it was   and like this thing about uhh uhh immigration and so on like i knew nothing about that  like i i agree that quebecers have to stand up for for what they believe in  i agree that uhh cough we we  have to defend ourselves too because it seems to be in this country everybody has the right to defend their rights except quebecers so uhh   w well  but when i asked you specifically about that question   of of immigration i it's  true you didn't say that you uhh you  thought we should stop immigration but but   but but   you did   well i didn't know what you were talking about   that's why   but you but you said that you know that it was your feeling that immigrants came and spit on quebecers  so you were using some pretty tough language yourself  yeah in a way yeah  but i don't blame immigrants for doing that  what i blame is the federal system  because i have lots of friends who are immigrants and i know i've spoke to lots of people coming from other countries and it's the federal government who've set them up to be against quebec right from the start  like i don't blame them at all  i i don't blame them i'm   and and i'm i'm  against being racist to these people  it's not their fault  mister dufour   it is true that it's true that  very often they have an attitude but i'm not blaming it for them  mister dufour   i'm not blaming them for that it's not their fault  mister dufour last week uhh we heard of fifteen people who'd come together for the beginnings of this uhh at the time you seemed to ah accept that you might of been among those fifteen  whether  no   you knew exactly what it was or not  have you spoken with some other people who are in  in the same boat as you  who had been as you say sold sold a bill of goods here   told it was one thing only to find out it's something else  yeah and there's the mouvement sovereignist de qu&eacute;bec i spoke to them and they were also told like that there was no mention of any possibility of any violence because again the  mouvement sovereignist de qu&eacute;bec is against violence and like i know that right from the start  like and and they were never told of that like  i think this guy he painted a pretty picture of what this movement would be  and he ahh he kind of talked to people he knew were uhh wanted to to ahh to do actions but ahh   but but you weren't suspicious that this guy was an ex-falquist ex member of the front du liberation du qu&eacutebec you know   no like i did this guy   was not even supposed to be there in the first place  i didn't even know who that was  it was supposed to be ahh will sobonne   so it was mister sobonne who approached you  no it's ahh i'm trying to remember the name of the  per person it's somebody from the organization but like they will sobonne was not even there when they spoke to me  it's just that's they invited me that's   that's a few weeks ago  and it wasn't   and it wasn't mister tillman who approached you  no no no i didn't even know this guy was there   and you   i learned that when i read le devoir and i just about fell off my chair  and you won't be there this weekend   for their meeting   no way   no way because i i  refuse to support any individual who who who does not uh refuse violence and racism  because i am totally against racism  i think it's the stupidest thing  and against violence   miss miss   mister   no way i will take part in anything that's  anything   i i've done in the past we've made sure we do it with a smile on our face  and and it i i   think violence it's the worst it   it's the worst enemey of quebec  mister dufour thanks for talking to us again today this morning  kay okay   good bye  bye bye  that's roy dufour with the mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais of outaouais   twenty-five minutes after eight   last week it was confirmed by the city of montreal that three library outlets would be closed in uhh saint-henri little burgundy in n d g  notre dame de gr&acircumflex;ce and at the mcgill metro  and then ahh news a little later in the week that a fourth uhh library outlet would also be on the chopping block  well last night in n d g a group of citizens got together to protest that decision by the city of montreal  hannah walkerton was one of the people there  she is with the friends of benny library and has been involved in a number of initiatives in her neighbourhood  good morning miss walkerton   good morning  miss walkerton could you maybe describe the benny library for me before we get into just what you think you can do to stop the city on this one  what what's it like  well well from the outside it's a   a fum a beautiful former chapel it's ahh part of our heritage in n d g  ah it it was built right after world war two to serve the veterans that came back from the war and uhh about ten years later i guess be  there a bigger church was built and uhh it was turned over and taken over by the city and turned into a library  so it's been there as an institution for about forty years serving the community  uhh largely the senior citizens of ahh benny farm right now  and and the young people  uhh more and more the collection in the library is about seventy percent french books and thirty percent english  so uhh it serves my needs for reading mostly bestsellers   and and i do some reference work with the kids there  it's a really homey atmosphere  ahh the kids lots of children from below sherbrooke street in the  apartment complexes come and flock there after school  it's like home you know  you don't get x-rayed on the way in or or   on the way out  it's just it's like walking into your own kitchen and the tables  so you know it's it's not brand new and it doesn't have all the amenities of a maison de couture  house of culture   but what it has is heart  and the people there know our children by name and they can help them with their homework  it's ahh it's an important place for me especially because i've decided to live in this society and to stay here  and my children are both in french school  and it might seem funny to people out there but my eight-year old and fourteen-year old barely read english  they need french culture access  they need services in french  i think our city sees these books as this is what this is  a building with books  and they don't realize that the people there who talk to my children in french since they've been in diapers have helped them integrate  into the society  had had helped them be just  like the little kids in their class that have been hearing french at home since laugh they came out of the womb  miss miss walkerton when we talked to the mayor last week about this he said that in that part of the city the city was investing money in private libraries and so the population was going to be well served by library services but primarily through the private libraries  yeah   what what do you make of that  well they said that they were in partnership they named i made her name the libraries because nobody could tell me which ones they were  and she she named two that i'm not familiar with  uhh uhm the frasier hickston is one they say they might  they almost have a private an accord   with but they've never given them money before  the montreal children's library is located in john-twenty-third school and it's in uhm a part of n d g below uhh the tracks and so uhh in that respect i agree that they should be because the children down there could never cross ahh you know you wouldn't want them crossing the tracks  there's just not enough access points  but you don't want the kids from above the tracks to have   t to do the same thing to get to a library  no but the library the children's library in uhh located in  john-twenty-third school is also i don't want my library to become like that because what it is its got very little service and it doesn't have anim&eacute; well what they call animation animation   yeah yeah   uhh it's a growing thing a library  you have to keep putting money into it  you have to keep buying books  if they just say give you we'll give you   all the books here you know put them you can  distribute them to the the people  the books would die very quickly  they'll become out of date ahh  miss walkerton i'm wondering wh   what do you do now  ahh as i understand it seventy or eighty people turned up last night to demand some answers   oh i think it was more   i put out a hundred and five chairs so ahh   okay and they were filled "
Canada	" jack babineau is of course the director of police services for the m u c montreal city police department   chief of police babineau joins us now  good morning sir  good morning mister gore   thanks for joining us this morning  my pleasure  you and your people had a tough week last week a very  tough week  yeah very tough week uhh i mean these things   you you always know that you know it  could happen but uhh when you're the uh police chief   you you i think it's your nightmare uhh and it it happened uhh and uhh you know   we uhh we have to overcome the situation  but still it's kind of hard  what's the latest in the investigation of the murder of  roberta piquard   i see this morning some specialized police services may be being called on  what what's happening  well you know uhuh obviously i won't talk about details but  we we're working on the case uhh trying to find uhh why uhh constable piquard was shot  and when you find the uhh the motive for uhh the shooting you you're usually next to the uh person who's who committed the murder  so we're working on it right now and i wouldn't like to go in detail obviously uhh   maybe you could confirm or deny this but i think the report in the journal montreal newspaper this morning saying you're trying to build up potential psychological profiles in the absense of you know any visual identification by any witness  that's what you're having to deal with  well the there's a science uhh developed in the united states with the f b i over the last twenty years called profiling  uhh and it you know with what happened on the scene the way the person was shot you can make a profile the not "" of the"" suspect you're looking for  and that's what we're going to be using uhm in a couple of days  as you know a number of questions about the security or lack thereof around that substation  was it consistent with procedures that she was there by herself   in that substation   oh yeah well everyday you got over two hundred police officers working on their own in patrol cars in stations  walking the beat  uhh you know when you wear this uniform there's always   always this potential for danger  that you might get hit  and that's what happened  so it's not unusual that she was she was  alone  what about things like i mean security cameras  that came up as well  why wasn't there a camera there even as as   a dissuasive measure but in terms of trying to crack the case after the fact  but do you really think cameras are a dissuasive uhh operation  we had cameras at the assembl&eacute;e nationale  and uhh you know people got shot  we have cameras in uhh banks and still they are getting robbed  we have cameras at the casino  uh two days ago a person sitting at a table decided to pull out a gun and and and make a robbery there even though there are plenties of camera plenty of cameras   uhh so you know it's not a deterrent  uhh we have to find ways so that our people don't get shot  and uhh it's kind of hard you know to be uhh protected uhh all the time  but are you committed to the substations and  cos it sounds to me like no changes in procedures for those substations  there won't be any changes  uhh and i'm pretty sure constable piquard uhh you know would have said the same thing  the key solution to problems that we have in this society  mainly violence is to go through community policing  the closer we're going to get to the population if we you know uhh if we're able to build bridges with the community uhh these things won't happen  you know you don't shot not "" shoot"" you know people you know  or uhh you know people around the police station will be uhh sort of a protection  uhh so that's the to me the way of the future  i want to pick up on another story that's the news this morning  the wolverine squad more arrests this morning and seems to seem like this initiative has become  has been very successful since you've finally got everybody together and started working together  i mean i've had this question right through so i'm going to ask you why did it seem to take so long to get everybody together and working in one direction  mhm well mainly it's a question of budget  i mean wolverine is doing a great job  it's not only to pull people together  uh it's a question of having the dollars  i mean it cost not "" costs"" a lot  uhm and we had this budget given by the quebec government  it made you know a big difference  ever since we worked  i think the police itself has done you know a great job  my main concern is that will the  judicial system correctional system will be able to follow uhh what we are doing right now  i mean it makes no sense if we make the arrest and people involved  in in these gangs uh get six months or a year in prison  so uhh you know after we've done our job somebody else has to do theirs  now this is supposed to be though part of the plan  i remember mister menard the minister of public security when he was talking about putting this in place and finding the budget one of the things he said was we've you know we got to make very sure that when those people end up before a judge that  that judge has all the information he needs to be able to make the kind of not only judgment but also the kind of sentencing that might act   as a as well as an element in beating this thing  umhm   are you sound like you're still sceptical though about the judges and their role in this  well ahh obviously they need to be informed uhh but to uh to to inform them we need uhh the tools to be able to do it mainly uh prosecutors  uhh we're going uh through uh you know kind of budget problems  uhh how do we uhh make sure that we can have twenty more prosecutors to do the job  and this is a question of money  and that's what they are debating uhh right now in  in quebec city news report interruption   chief babineau i wanted to get some of your thoughts on the uhh the big announcement yesterday by a number of ministers of various ministries uhh here in quebec about measures designed to prevent conjugal violence   mhm   and there's a whole array of things that were there from each of these ministries  one of the major ones though seems to be just trying to make sure  you know it's a bit like the wolverine task force the information flows   mhm   that if a guy gets out of prison that that  his spouse who's a potential target of violence is informed  that that the police  the local police gets the information into their computers quickly so that the man or woman on the street in the car can you know punch it up right away  it's what do you think of some of these things that are were announced yesterday  what what about this whole problem  cos it's huge  i mean just this past week what four women found killed  my my first comment is at last  ahh you know it took it took a long time  uhh the m u c police has had a program like that for a over a year  uhh we have four police officers working uh at the uhh  parajustice uh and they're informing uhh women that their uhh husband uhh is getting out  uhh and we're working with the victims  and then we we've had that for a year now  so it's working pretty good  how does that system work  so as as soon as someone is to be released for whatever reason there's an immediate contact with the person  before the person is released there's a call uhh to the victim saying within uh within an hour the uhh person involved in your incident will be freed she the   person is getting out  uhh is everything alright  they're working with the person helping them to find solutions to the problem  if the problem is security we might find a place for them  and help them to go through this nightmare  so those four officers are are  contact people in both directions  i mean if if a problem arises from the side of the woman or the citizen they can get in touch with them  that's it  that's what was missing before  well one of the other things that i mean cos one of the things mister menard spoke about yesterday was the delays that often happen  you know as even if it's known it doesn't necessarily get into the computer so that maybe somebody knows but everybody doesn't know  is that part of your procedures as well   mhm   is that in that's in all  those those little onboard computers i see your folks tapping into all the time  laugh well their job uhh with this program  the the police officers involved   their job is to uh make sure the victim is well-secured  and the victim knows what's happening  and uhh you know we're there to help  and that's the uh the main change  we are uh we are involved in the case and we know what uh people are going through  so we're trying to help them uh you know try to find solutions  mister menard also seemed to talk in terms of uh really  targeting those responsible for the violence  i mean maybe they were convicted on a violent i mean on a charge linked directly to the violence but if you can get em on anything else whether it's firearms possession or weapons possession or just like anything you slap with it  is is that your approach as well  uhh i fully agree with that  i mean uhh violence uh should not be a part of what's happening in our society  i mean too often and it's too bad people solve their problems with violence  and it's not only adults kids do it  so uh uh together we have to find solutions  and i think the uh proposition uh given yesterday is one uh step in a good direction  just a little bit of a budget from that ministry for these things  fifty thousand dollars i think it is for training  feeling that there needs to be some kind of upgrading or   sense sensitivity training i guess you'd say  for officers in this whole field of conjugal violence  where do you think you are with your force on that issue  yeah well there will always be budget problems uhh but   that's not uh it shouldn't stop us from you know taking care of victims   and uhh the main thing uh victims want is to know  to get the information  what's happening what will happen to me  and and i think we're answering these questions right now  the the and as i say there were a number of ministers involved in that press conference yesterday  mister rochand doctor rochand  talking about ahh special budgets for support services uhh the minister of education talking about you know some getting at the uhh roots of violence as well  yeah uhuh mhm yeah violence   how optimistic are you about these kind of initiatives  i mean it's easy to be cynical easy to be   pessimistic and i'm sure especially you see the kinds of things you see  everyday it's especially easy to be cynical and pessimistic  mhm mhm   but what's what's  how reasonably how can how reasonably  optimistic can we be about this   it works and and you know it's not only a question of procedures it's a question of caring for victims  and it's a a change in attitudes  if we change the attitude  if if you're a police officer and you're dealing only this case and you know it's for you only a case well  we won't uhh we won't be able to solve the uhh   the the whole problem  if as a police officer you think that there's a problem   and the problem is the victim is facing this problem  and you are there to care for the victim you will find solutions "
Canada	 that's elena harte and like water and that is the title track of her new c d  uh it's uh coming out uh next monday exactly a week from today  uh elena is uh a montrealer  uh she is a singer and a songwriter  this is her first c d eh uh and it's being launched next week  uh by day she leaves her guitar and her singing voice at home  she goes off to work as a youth coordinator at the snowden y y m c a   she's been working with young people for almost a decade now  you must have been very young  including troubled teens and autistic children  elana's going to join me today to talk about some of her experiences with kids and uh tell me more about her music as well  hi  welcome to the program  thank you  good to meet you  uh now you work with teens  you were you were at an outdoor  concert  that's right   and somebody heard ya you   that's that's   tell me how that that turned into a job  laugh   laugh   uhm i would volunteer my time for this outdoor concert uh for kids in park extension  uhm hmm  and they do it every year  i mean it's ongoing even now  and someone from the ville de montreal who of course is involved in that program uh saw me there and decided that i would be an asset to the youth centre that was already in existence  uhm got me coded as a specialist and i started working with those kids on a very limited scale  what was it they saw in your in your   body language during the concert  do you do you know how to work an audience well or what  fairly well  i've had a lot of experience and the kids respond well to my music  uh huh   uhm i was involved in the you know all the  production aspect of it so  and i started working with these kids and teaching them the basics of guitar and vocals  working with them developing rap music with them  which was really something for me  that was uh  laugh   you not a rap fan or or not   not   rap's not first on your list let's put it that way   yeah   let's just say that i don't write it very easily and to bring in a very large amplifier and a drum machine and a keyboard and a this and a that and a   the noise levels were a little extreme when you're working with twenty kids at a time who are asking you twenty different questions plus the sound plus the  it was quite the experience  it was spinning huh  laugh   fiorinal a non-narcotic pain-reliever laugh   made made good money off me that year and uh  but it was their music of choice right it was the way they wanted to express themselves   yeah it was and that's exactly what you have to do    it's their music of choice  that's what you go for  tell me about the first experience with them because these were kids who probably don't have a very ho happy  home life if any home life at all right  some of them don't  some of them are uh some of them do come from uh single parent families  some of them are involved in uh some type of either   some of them are involved in some type of gang   most of them or some of them have been exposed to that milieu so they have a very different outlook than i do  uh they're the way that they judge their peers the way they judge their accomplishments is completely different from mine  but i learned a lot about them  i mean i learned from them from them   if they didn't if they stayed out of trouble it was something  if they finished school it was something  if they uh went on to do something bigger and better it was something  if they had a good day some of them it was something  there were times when i was really scared  most of the time it was just great  what scared you  they scared you or or the lives they had to lead scared you   uhm most of the time it was things that happened that would scare me  like when the police raided the centre and this weapon came in uh  that was pretty scary   that would scare me yeah   uh other things some of them were uh holding weapons of some type  so either in a bag or in a pocket whatever  when you found out they were there with these weapons it became sometimes sometimes the potential of a situation  you had to handle it  uhm hmm  these were things i mean  after a while you kind of got accustomed to   what kind of weapons we talking about knives and   in the knives and in the guns and in the whatever else happened to be around and in the word chains and  it really wasn't all the time though  it was just there were enough events that would happen that you were very aware of what was going on out there  and that's uh  but when you hear that and  and i  of course you're thinking about your own your own  personal safety but i mean do you think these kids are   are just trouble makers or or  they're dealing with the situation they know how the only way they know how to deal with it  i gather some of these kids were just protecting themselves in the milieu they live in right  you know you try   that's pretty much it  i think that some of the kids get in there and they do it for social reasons and emotional reasons  they need to to be involved in something and that's  that's how they do  and that's what's available to them  they have some of them don't have a home life  some of them uhm have gone through some abuse at home  yeah   yeah  and that's what this is what they get into and we your job was to try and get them out  other kids were just trying to exist you know in the milieu they were  and again it's not all the kids  and it wasn't all you know every day  but it was something that i'd never seen before  i'd never been involved in that before  i'd lived in another suburb  i had lived in like i don't know snowden where in my childhood it was fairly quiet  and even n d g notre-dame-de-grace wasn't really rough  yeah   so why didn't it spook you completely and say now i've got to find another line of work  what was it about the kids  they were just great kids  yeah  they were like you know this this  rap  they do rap shows now and this concert stuff and when the kid finally sits down and talks to you and and you can you know lend a hand and and   even now there's like four or five kids that still call my house and let me know what they're doing and i'm very proud of some of them  they've gone on to do lovely and wonderful things  yeah   well what how did you gain their trust  and get them to open up  i would imagine a lot of them to be pretty unresponsive to begin with and tell you to get lost at first  that's a nice way of putting it laugh   laugh well i have a list of other words here but i can't use any of them laugh   i think what you have to do with adolescents is you really have to wait and be patient  you have to listen to them  uhm not judge them  not give them the spiel that they get or they might get from somebody else  you know the when i was a child or uhm you know  i think you should be doing this   it takes a little longer uh with an adolescent  and they have to learn when they learn  to open up and they learn to relax and then then  that's it  yeah  then you're there  and then you have to take responsibility for what you're doing  cos at that point if you  i think personally if you turn away from them uhm  you're you're hurting them more than your helping them  hence i still get phone calls and  i'm still pretty much involved and life goes on with my adolescents at the y  same as kids from park-ex park-extension, a montreal neighbourhood   there's some kids i still speak to  and i gather music must have been a great key to open a door  that's a crummy ah metaphor but i i  gather it is right  laugh   it's a it's a good introduction  yeah  it's a good first step  and when the kids when you're when adolescents  that they really i don't know whether they glorify this industry which is fine  and everybody wants to be a guitarist and play guitar and be a rock star or a rap star or some type of musical   yeah yeah   uhm when they see you and they see you perform and if you do it fairly well and you you share with them  then at that point they feel like they are able to talk to you  they're able to reach out to you  you become familiar  you become accessible  and for that like i say   you've got something in common   that's it  well it's a first step  yeah  and then you have to carry it from there  i guess you you can't be afraid that one one of these days one of these kids is going to go away and not come back  i guess you've got to expect that right  it happens  you have to wait as you say and be patient and hope  that's right  uhm now dealing with these kids  even before that you you knew how to deal with kids with real problems  well these these were well physical as well as emotional  but you dealt with autistic children  much younger but again still somebody you had to reach in order to bring them out  do you see the trend somewhere  yeah laugh   yeah i had the opportunity i guess to uh  i was lucky  i had the opportunity to work with autistic kids at giant steps for a couple of years and  wow i was involved in the music program there  and the things that we did and we sang songs and we played drums and  now how old were these kids  i'd say they were much younger but how much younger  i three to eleven   two and a half three to eleven  oh okay  yeah so all pretty uh pubescent kids  yeah oh yeah  and uh it's just a great program there  i mean the attention that they give to the children  and the growth that at least i saw uhm of these students that were involved in this program and these programs is phenomenal  and it just you know when you see uh uh a three year old singing along with you and and  really getting into it  and big big eyes and big smile  and especially if it's a kid who has some problems communicating or some problems with comprehension it really is something  hmmm  them or a child who hasn't said much of anything for ages right  yeah  or ever or pretty much ever   that's exciting  yeah yeah   it was something  it was also very draining  i mean it was very very very draining  i was you know these kids they're physically  they're uh  it's very difficult  especially when they're bigger than you  and uh you know you you have  i remember getting bitten once and bursting into tears  and i went back to work the next day but it was just  the shock   it'd break your heart yeah   yeah that's pretty much what it did  yeah but of course again again  they have no other way of showing some things  and and their anger is ending up on your arm right laugh   your arm face yeah  yeah that's that's pretty much what happens is i don't think these kids  they can't uh express themselves verbally  they're gonna going to do  and you know something  adolescents are the same way in that way   i was just gonna going to say    you know you were saying is there is there a pattern here   but the music really uh is important 
Canada	 so over procedures it's a question of attitude  attitude from police officers from social workers from judges  uhh you know we've had bad examples over the uhh last couple of years were judges didn't think it was important  uhh so uhh it's a the community as a whole has to ah realize that this is a big issue  and we have to work on it  and yet we've just been through a week where four women found murdered  uh two of them apparently conjugal violence  the others perhaps conjugal violence  mhm   yeah but it should be enough to make people realize that there's a lot of violence in this society  and that you know every person in this society can make a difference by not accepting uhh the roots of violence  and and if you see kids uhh going through problems and solving these problem through violence it's your job as a parent as a teacher as as a neighbour uhh to get involved  uhh to make sure that in ten years from now uhh adults won't be solving problems with violence still  mister babineau thanks for joining this morning  my pleasure mister gore   that's jack babineau   he is of course the chief of police in the m u c  it is eight minutes now before eight   yeah  alright   there were standing   i think we had ahh for one day notice i'm really proud that the neighbourhood was able to hear about it  so so can you tell quickly just   what what happens next  well uhm i don't know  the people have been getting letters  the c l s c abbreviation for centres locaux de services communautaires there's over fif fifty   communities over fifty well over  community groups who represent thousands of people have come out against it  i mean people have to say our library our places where   we we're helped uh we help immigrants fit into our our society  we can't judge them on the number of books borrowed  and uhh maybe n d g needs double the budget than other neighbourhoods because we have a high concentration of new people arriving in canada  miss wa walkerton     sor sorry i'm   sor sorry   i   i think that   okay uhh i don't know  there's a protest next tuesday night i would say anybody who can come down to city hall on the twelfth and and at six o'clock at night and and we'll raise a ruckus  we'll be we'll we'll   uh uh you know maybe we can we we  submitted more than a thousand names on petitions  he's not listening  uh the the school in n d g  un autre sainte-catherine-de-sienne sent in a letter of protest with three hundred signatures yesterday from the children  miss walkerton   yup  i'm going to have to cut in there cos i'm running out of time  okay  but best of luck  well you know this administration isn't listening  they're really it's a done deal   i think that our library is cut this year because they have to save money somewhere so they can fund the superhighway  miss walkerton thanks for talking to us again  okay  bye bye  that's hannah walkerton with the friends of benny library  what do the scientists hope will happen later today  deep breath they're hoping that the spacecraft will survive  that it will make the plunge into jupiter  it's coming in like a comet  it has to endure intra incredible   temperatures  uh the heat of friction as it slows down incredible forces uh acting on it  then they're hoping that the parachute will open the instruments will work and we'll begin to get data  they're also hoping that the second part of the galileo spacecraft will put itself into orbit where it will remain for the next two years  and what are they hoping to find out  this is the first time that a spacecraft has ever touched  one of what are called one of what are called  the gas giant planets  jupiter is more like a star then a planet  it's made of hydrogen and helium  the same stuff as the sun  and because of that they are hoping they're able to see a piece of what the solar system used to look like  jupiter hasn't changed in over four billion years  it's still made of the same primordial material that the entire solar system including the earth was made of and because its so primative that in a way looking at jupiter is like looking back in time  so they're very excited about that   and it became apparent that if if  our soldiers were going to defend that position it would be totally untenable  they would not have been able to do it  so after some uh fairly stubborn resistance and some heated conversation and debate uh orders were issued by the commander that uh they were to leave with the uh croatian soldiers  so had they tried to stay i i think the tune would've been different uh but uh there was no point in the face of the overwhelming odds to uh to stay there uhm any longer so they were forced to leave  what uh you were saying the negotiations are well under way though to get them to rastovic?  yes it's not really negotiation it's simply a question uh  there're still uh a lot of croatian troops moving in the area obviously they wish to control the roads  so it's more a question of scheduling uh to get them through  under escort you just uh if you're owning the battlefield which the croatians do you just don't want uhm you know unknown groups of people travelling around in vehicles  is there a danger in going through that area?  not at this stage  uh the croatians very much control it uh they uh  they are in the bankovac uh town of bankovac which is about four kilometres from rastovic which was a serbian stronghold  uh we see now uh croatian civilians who had lived originally in the krajina in the houses in and around rastovic and around where the canadian soldiers are stationed returning now to uh reclaim their homes  they have paperwork that shows they were in fact their homes  and so we have a lot of movement of civilian populations in the area  we have a number of uh refugees that have come to uh the camp at rastovic uh for succour looking for uh uh water and food and that sort of thing and and a bit of protection from the   u united nations to make sure that uh they're well looked after  so there's there is always some confusion in a battlefield area uh immediately afterwards and that's what we're seeing right now  so our soldiers are patrolling the area trying to make sure that there are no uh live rounds lying around because there was a lot of artillery barrages and uh and that sort of thing  what's the situation you mentioned refugees are there many of them at this point? coming to your soldiers   uh there are not as many as we uh might have expected initially but uh we had i think at last count was nineteen   l that stayed last night near our camp in rastovic  but there's also as i mentioned a lot of croatian people who are coming back to reclaim their homes and move into the area  so there's still quite a bit of movement  there's a lot of uh military movement in the area  and so uh it's just uh as i say with respect to the forty-three it's simply a question of scheduling and making a mutually convenient time that they can use the roads  there are very very few roads in the area so uh traffic clogs them very quickly  i is there have we sort of turned a corner here now that the croatians have recaptured some of the territory?  um does this change the peacekeeping mission?  oh absolutely  uh it is no longer uh two sides with a a  clear demarcation line between the two of them  it is now the sovereign state of croatia  they are firmly in control uh certainly down in our area  uh and so i would suspect that uh the united nations authorities in consultation with croatian authorities will be coming up with some form of  an either a new mandate or a change to the current mandate or in fact even an end to the current mandate  and i think uh that is something that will   will be uh on the uh security council's table this morning  uh and i think very soon we will probably receive uh new direction as to exactly what to do  in the meantime there is a tremendous humanitarian mission that is available here  uh there are lots and lots of refugees moving about in the area  uh there are croatians migrating back in to take over their town  so there's a constant movement of civilians  and with that uh and of course war brings a lack of food a lack of water uh that type of thing so i think that   the humanitarian side is the the  biggest issue right now  you're trying to provide for them   thank you very much for speaking with us this morning  okay my pleasure  lieutenant commander ken watson of the canadian armed forces   the summer barbeque can be followed by a horror called  barbeque hamburger disease intestinal cramps and much worse  the bacterium that causes it is a particular type of e coli which is found in the intestines of animals and so it's not uncommon in store-bought meat  trouble is that ten percent of children who get hamburger disease  can go on to develop serious kidney disease  janelle irving is the national coordinator of a large study just completed by the canadian paediatric kidney disease research centre in ottawa and she's on the line now this morning  good morning  good morning jim   ah the research centre is planning to publish results from an extensive three year study it conducted involving hundreds of canadian children and uh they were diagnosed with so-called hamburger disease  how did these kids get the disease?  well jim there's there's  several ways that you can come into contact with hamburger disease although our nickname uhm being that it that would make one think it comes from eating undercooked hamburger minced meat   that is quite true although in addition person to person spread is really the number one ah risk factor involved with this infection  so it's food-borne?  yep that's exactly right  and that has the bacteria and usually if if  it's undercooked that's that's a tip-off right?  exactly if you uhm if if you think  about your uhm your your kitchens for   for a minute and preparing hamburgers for the barbeque at this time of year we can't see this bacteria in the ground beef   and of course most of us uhm myself included use our hands to prepare these hamburger patties  uh if the bacteria is there and if you are not really really uh conscious of washing your hands well with warm soapy water after you have handled the ground beef before you come into contact with your family members or before you go on to prepare the salad as the next part of your meal you really are risking spreading that bacteria within your kitchen  so this is uh a significant finding in the study that  that you can get it also through personal contact  right ?  exactly   it's a very important finding and it's one really that uhm you know when we first started working in this area uhm that really we were not as acutely aware of as we are now  we're not washing our hands enough are we?  we're not  now i read about an outbreak uh of the e coli in   in new england  people who'd been drinking apple cider from  from an  orchard can you get sick i guess you can get sick from cider?  mmm   yes   yes you can and this has actually been this is not the first outbreak to be reported linked to apple cider  the problem there uhm jim what happens is the  the apples that are selected if you like for fresh apple cider this is the road or farm stand apple cider that we're talking about  uh is not necessarily picked directly from the apples from the trees these are usually the ones that have fallen on the ground that in fact have been contaminated or mixed in with the animal faeces or animal waste   that is that is sort of in the ground  for example manure   ohhh 
Canada	" mister speaker that is very strong endorsement from the province of nova scotia  lastly i would like to refer to the representation made by the representatives from new brunswick and alberta governments who kindly answered uh the invitation that was made to all provinces to appear in front of the standing committee on h r d human resource development   this is what mister smith from new brunswick responded to a question from the m o from m mercier as to whether the bill was an intrusion into provincial jurisdiction   french quotation, 20 seconds   he added that the federal-provincial agreements provided for in the bill as well as the enhanced administrative and technical  co-operation the bill would lead to a further guarantee of continued federal provincial full co-operation with respect to designation of authority  this is what mister hemmingway from alberta commented  i think one of the problems we have today in relation to the federal loan program is discrepancies between and amongst provinces with respect to which institutions may be designated   i know that the federal concern has been given that it's a national program  the benefits should be reasonably equal across the country  we are presuming and it is our understanding that we will have a great deal of input in developing the designation criteria that will be put in place and that those criteria would be negotiated on ongoing basis between the two levels of government   mister speaker to me it what this legislation clearly indicates is that if there is one single group of people that are against this legislation are the members of the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois   and so uh i want to perhaps mister speaker now to return to  to the specific issue the specific uh motion  and to tell you that we as a as a government are committed to providing consistency and fairness under our student assistance program   the amendment presented uh would repeal subsection four two and four three of the bill which provide the minister with the flexibility to establish policy directives  and mister speaker i think that if we are to look at this in a very clear and rational way there is nothing wrong with the federal minister having something to say about a federal initiative a federal policy  there's absolutely nothing wrong  it is within his right and may i say it is his duty and obligation to make sure that he has something to say about the policy initiatives the policy direction under the this particular act  and so i fail to understand and i have spent a great deal of time trying to figure it out exactly what the opposition is saying and trying to follow a logic of the opposition but perhaps the problem is not one of logic  perhaps the problem here goes above and beyond that  it's a question of vision   but for the moment mister speaker i'm not here and i'm not going to engage myself in a constitutional discussion  the reason why i am debating today is because there are hundreds of thousands of students who are awaiting this program provinces awaiting this program part-time students students with disabilities women who want to pursue doctoral studies students who have  been victimized by heavy debt load  this is the issue that we are debating today   it is for this reason that i simply cannot support the amendment as proposed by the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois   the mister speaker the government must be in a position to ensure that the policies which are developed are applied consistently across the country  it would uh appear that the opposition is not overly concerned  about treating students fairly throughout canada because of their own political agenda  therefore mister speaker i tell you on behalf of the thousands of students who are awaiting this program on the thousands of students in need  who want to acquire the skills to be competitive to acquire the life skills necessary to meet the challenges of the new economy acquire the education that is part and parcel of life today as we live through a learning continuum as we engage in life-long life-long  learning it is fundamental that we support these students  and it is for that reason that i will not be supporting the motion presented by the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois audience applause   the honourable member for medicine hat   cough thank you very much mister speaker  i rise to oppose this motion from the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois  seems to me that the provinces have spoken with one voice on this issue   they had a chance to speak up on bill c twenty-eight  they came before the standing committee on human resources development to talk about this particular piece of legislation and in every case they have suggested that they will go along with this legislation and that they are in support of it  we can't start giving carte blanche to provinces including quebec simply because que  quebec uh the members down the way demand it  we must be respectful of what the provinces themselves are saying  even in the case of quebec  they have indicated that they're quite comfortable with this particular piece of legislation  people in alberta are happy with it  people in the maritimes are happy with it  i don't really understand the paranoia down the way  i can only assume that there ares there are   other reasons uh for this motion coming up than the one stated  having said that mister speaker we cannot support this motion and we will be saying more however down the road about some of the problems inherent in bill c twenty-eight  french introduction   french, 11 minutes applause   french introduction   french, 11 minutes applause   short french statement raising motion   all those in all those o  opposed please say nay audience responds "" nay""   short french statement   the uh pursuant to standing order seventy-six point one the recorded division in the motion stands deferred.  short french statement   french, 11 minutes applause   the honourable member for beaches-woodbine  thank you mister speaker  the honourable member is right when she says that thirty  per percent thirty years   is a long time  and we've had this program for thirty years  federal co-operation federal-provincial co-operation has existed under the student loan act for thirty years and the co-operation and support continues to to   happen  we heard from the parliamentary secretary just recently earlier today that in fact the provinces in this country do support this act  and this is very important  mister speaker under this bill provinces will continue to be able to opt out of the federal student assistance program if they choose to offer their own program to student assistance  there's nothing new here  opted out provinces will be able to receive compensation if they have a program which is substantially the same has substantially the same effect as the federal program  this is nothing new again  the government is simply carrying forward provisions from the previous act  moreover mister speaker we are expanding uh provisions for compensation to provinces which choose to opt out to ensure that their students benefit from the proposed reforms   this i think is a positive initiative  we are also providing for accountability  this is something that i believe is very critical if we are to be accountable to the taxpayers of this country mister speaker  accountability is something that the taxpayers have asked us to make sure that we do  for this reason we are asking those opted out jurisdictions to satisfy the minister that they have in place a program that has substantially the same effect as the federal program in order to receive compensation  surely mister speaker this is only responsible and reasonable   this can be accomplished by a simple letter once a year from non-participant provinces  it is not an onerous detailed demand  it is a simple letter of response and communication  it is not terribly demanding  section fourteen seven mister speaker establishes that a province choosing to opt out is compensated for those program elements which are in place at the provincial level  without section fourteen seven an opted out province could be compensated for program elements which are not available within that province  to me mister speaker that would not be responsible  we must be accountable and continue to be accountable to the taxpayers  we would increase the government cost without any assurance that students are receiving the benefits provided for under this legislation  again mister speaker i believe that it is important in this country and we have discussed it for the last eight months accountability in how we spend the federal tax dollar is very important  the provinces have agreed with the provisions in this in this uhm in this act   and they've agreed to the provisions because they feel comfortable that in fact their jurisdiction is not being affected that they are   pro protected under the the uh the uh constitution and that this is a s  co-operative process working together for the benefit of the students of this country and in and and in  doing so ensuring that students across canada will receive the same programs and have the same access to good programs for post-secondary education  so mister speaker i really see nothing new and nothing terribly uh earth shaking in the in in these changes and i believe that they are for the benefit of canadians  therefore i would say mister speaker that i suggest that this motion is out of order  if the motion stands i would urge all members to vote against it  thank you mister speaker  the honourable member for medicine hat  thank you very much uh mister speaker   a previous speaker i should say an earlier speaker refued  referred to the duty of the opposition when uh  when the opposition looks at legislation such as we have before us today  i think it's incumbent upon the opposition to give the legislation a thorough vetting and when one comes across a clause that they're uncomfortable with to check it out to consult the stakeholders to find out what the different opinions are on it  and after having done that if they are satisfied that the stakeholders don't have any particular problem with it then they shouldn't oppose it for the sake of opposing it  and i point out the members in the bloc that although the government of quebec was invited to come before the h r d committee to talk about this they did not  they are comfortable apparently with this particular clause of the bill  they have the ability of course and have taken advantage of the ability to opt out of uh of this of the  previous act and presumably of this one as well  i think it's very important that the opposition picks its time and place to make a big deal about these things   but to cry wolf too often mister speaker only guarantees that you will have no audience when it's really important   i was very suspicious throughout the entire uh meetings that we had with respect to this bill about uh some of the intentions of the government  i wanted to ensure that the provinces' rights weren't being tampered with that they weren't being in  infringed upon  but in looking at it and after talking to all the people involved talking to the ministers their departments rather and their officials  they don't have concerns  i don't understand why we're even talking about this given the fact that even the government of quebec doesn't seem to have any concerns  mister speaker for the uh in the  interest of expediency i would hope that we will uh defeat this motion  french introduction   french, 10 minutes   french introduction   french, 9 minutes   french introduction   french, 10 minutes   french introduction   french, 11 minutes   french introduction   french, 11 minutes   french introduction   french, 10 minutes   french, closing debate   the honourable member for kindersley-lloydminster  applause   uh thank you very much mister speaker  uh scandals and unfounded allegations and unanswered questions have plagued government and parliaments throughout our history and certainly the prime minister's statement this morning was welcome in   n need in light of our past history  in his speech this morning on integrity in government the prime minister claimed that the power of the ethics counsellor will prevent deals like the pearson airport privatization from happening again  so my question to the prime minister is what is there about the pearson deal that the ethics counsellor would prevent   the hon honourable   right honourable prime minister  a deal like that will not occur not laugh  because the government will never sign ah a deal that like that "
Canada	 it's as simple as that  and uhh applause i don't know   it's very easy  the ethics counsel is there and there there   is legislation  the members will have an occasion to interview him  he's a very competent person  he will give advice to the government  but as i said you know in final analysis final analysis it's the government who decides  and when we have a bad government like the tory government that you voted for before the last previous election or before you know that's the type of government that produces these like that  but that won't happen with the liberal government  you can be reassured applause   the honourable member for kindersley-lloydminster applause  mis mis mister speaker thank you mister speaker   we we're hoping that some of the clout that this ethics counsellor will have will prevent the liberal government following in the step footsteps of previous government  we're hoping   mister speaker the prime minister said this morning and i quote deals like the pearson airport deal must never be allowed to happen again and i concur  but mister speaker would the prime minister tell us will the ethics counsellor have power of intervention to stop deals such as the pearson when ethics issues arise  that's what he indicated to us this morning  the right honourable prime applause   the right honourable prime minister   if you conclude that the deal was made because of the lobbyists you know the counsellor will look at the lobby business and intervene  but at the end of the day any deals any contract by the government is made by the government  yeah yeah we cannot deny our responsibilities as government  and we've been in this government for eight months and the people are very pleased that that   you just made reference to that  it's not like it was before  why  it's because this government is committed to honesty and integrity in public eye  and the government is the one that will remain this way  and and uh if the ethics counsellor can help us you know it's why i appointed him to help us  but in the final analysis as i said this morning you know the government remains the government  we've been elected to make ah decisions and we're trying to get the best advice possible  and mister wilson is a man of some credibility that has done his job properly advising ministers over a long period of time  he is competent and we're very happy that he has accepted to face these new responsibilities  but his job is not to replace the government  the government will remain the government applause   the honourable member for kindersley-lloydminster  thank you mister speaker  and i appreciate the prime minister's answer because he's made it fairly clear i think in our minds that the hon   honourable the uh the new ethics counsellor does not have power of of intervention but his power lies in his ability to report to the public  so therefore uh this morning uh  pardon me  recently it was decided that a single annual report from the auditor general was not sufficient  and this morning the prime minister informed this house that the new ethics counsellor would report just once a year to parliament  mister speaker based on past performance and our history conflicts of interest and ethics may arise on a regular basis and certainly an annual report to parliament will not be sufficient  so my question mister speaker is can the prime minister explain how the ethics counsellor can effectively communicate to the public uh without a chance of political interference regarding the conduct of government if he is only required to file a report annually applause   the honourable minister of industry  mister speaker uhm i think the question that is being raised in terms of the ethics counsellor misses the point  what the honourable member should be noting is that at the present time there is no ethics counsellor and no reports have been filed  what this government has done is moved forward on the  commit commitment   i'm sorry  there's another question audience hubbub   what what this government has done today is moved forward on a number of important commitments that were contained in the red book liberal party platform commitments to  to uh fulfil the report of the uh standing committee of the house of commons from last june the commitment to appoint an ethics counsellor the commitment to give him investigatory powers the commitment to stop the contingency fees that were audience commotion polluting the government procurement process  these are important commitments  we have met them  they should be applauding us applause   the honourable member for yorkton-melville  thank you mister speaker  my question is for the minister of justice  on march fourteenth the minister said in the house and i'd like to quote i do not believe it is reasonable for anybody to interpret the term sexual orientation as it appears in the human rights legislation as including pedophiles   mister speaker whether child molesters are homosexual or heterosexual in their orientation they certainly are not reasonable  and mister speaker child abusers will find it entirely reasonable to launch a challenge to the criminal code on the basis of their sexual orientation if the term is not de defined  in the human rights act  my question  why is the minister so reluctant to define the term sexual orientation applause   the honourable parliamentary secretary  mister speaker i i want to say to the honourable member that the minister of justice is in no way reluctant to define the term sexual orientation but he himself has expressed the seriousness of this question in the relevant situations  it is going to require a good deal of study to deal with this and the m minister of justice is now in the middle of of of doing this study in the department  and we will have not only a a definition of sexual orientation but we will be able to bring forward to the house a a a program and a and and a uh and a policy which i think the house will approve applause   the honourable member for yorkton-melville  thank you  i appreciate that   and if the meaning of that term sexual orientation  is so clear and he referred to jurisprudence prev   previously as being the avenue by which he would have it be defined then i believe that government should take over should not shirk its responsibilities and it should define this because the minister said  i do not think matters of public policy should be determined in the courts   so i would like to put this question to the minister  why is he not willing to take that responsibility let that be discussed here and to define it properly in the legislation applause   the honourable parliamentary secretary   mister speaker the the minister of justice i think is has put before this house a record which would is is enviable as far  in in my opinion audience response   he he has brought forward legislation on on young offenders on sentencing uh ah amendments to the criminal code and the fact of the matter is if  if justice is going to be done laws must be framed properly  and uh not all of the amendments that we would like to see can be done at the same time  and the fact of the matter is reflection and due care must be given to the presentation and the formulation of these laws  and that is exactly what's going to be done   the honourable member for wild rose applause   extracorpus speaker   the honourable minister of health  mister speaker i must say that aids is a very serious uh epidemic and uh if we can save one life then we must do everything in our power  this particular booklet was put together especially for those communities at risk and there are times mister speaker when you have to call a spade a spade or people won't understand applause   the honourable member for wild rose  extracorpus speaker audience hubbub   order  order   order   i'm i'm sure the honourable member will want to put his supplementary  extracorpus speaker audience cheers   the honourable minister of health  mister speaker this information was certainly not put together for young children but these kinds of behaviours are extremely risky and those who do participate in these kinds of behaviours should have the kind of knowledge that they need to make sure they do not spread the h i v aids virus  applause   the honourable member for saint-denis  french, 15 seconds   can the parliamentary secretary tell us what concrete steps have the federal and provincial governments agreed to in their efforts to house canadians in need applause   your honourable parliamentary secretary  french, 5 seconds   agreement to remove and reduce duplication and overlap to harmonize the building codes in canada  they've completed consultations on environmental problems but most importantly mister speaker it was agreed to develop new partnerships to develop additional strategies to attack social housing to   french, 5 seconds audience laughter   to establish priority of need in each of the jurisdictions by the end of summer and to come forward with new concrete initiatives that they will develop from the savings and efficiencies that they have undertaken  it's a boon mister speaker for canadians who earn low income in remote small isolated rural and urban areas as well as for home owners and renters applause   the honourable member for fraser valley west  thank you mister speaker  mister speaker my question is for the minister of citizenship and immigration  september nineteen ninety-three mister speaker a young lady in my riding was raped by an illegal immigrant  i have in my possession a lengthy criminal record of that individual which reflects sex offences drunk driving theft and on and on it goes  my question for the minister is this  what system is in place to ensure that people like this are kicked out of canada and stay out of canada audience response   the honourable minister of immigration  mister speaker this government uh doesn't accept illegal immigrants as as much as uh this member or this party  and in fact tomorrow we will be tabling legislation in the house of commons to further strengthen the fact that those individuals who come here illegally those individuals who commit crimes against the very system and of justice and values that we believe in as canadians that those ammendments tomorrow will be in effort to further strengthen those who wish to abuse our laws will pay the price applause  the honourable uh member for fraser valley west   well mister speaker uh the minister's going to have a good opportunity today to uh just see how well he backs that up because this young lady agreed to drop the sexual assault charges on the condition on the condition this repeat offender was deported  and he was in november last year  now i find this chronic sex offender this failed refugee claimant is back in my community to appear by invitation by this minister's officials to appear at a second hearing to be allowed to stay in canada  audience grumbling   mister speaker my question is this to the minister  why is he even getting a hearing in the first place and why has the government reneged reneged on its promise to keep this criminal out of canada applause   the honourable minister of immigration  mister speaker i i audience grumbling   have you finished audience grumbling   mister speaker i don't i don't intend to engage on the floor of the house of commons on a on a  case where a the member has not given me advanced notice of the member's uh name uh or the case file  mister speaker the member may not wish audience grumbling   no no  mister speaker   mister speaker the member the member  may not wish to respect the legislation privacy legislation due process  what i what i what i say again to the honourable member is that no one on that side has a virtue or a monopoly on virtue about those cases that are abhorrent to all canadians  right   and i will certainly look at the case that the honourable member speaks about and that we tomorrow will be putting forward amendments with the aim mister speaker of making it very very clear that those in the minority who abuse will have those loopholes closed  and i hope that his party will look forward to a passage speedy for that piece of legislation applause   the honourable member for calgary northest applause   thank you mister speaker  my question is for the minister of citizenship and immigration further to the question raised by my colleague from fraser valley west  the minister in the past has told canadians that these are isolated cases the airplane airplane analogy as i call it 
Canada	" i'd like him to tell that to the young lady anxiously awaiting the results of her hiv test while this rapist walks the streets of her neighbourhood  my question mister speaker  in matsqui prison in b c today is another repeat offender who has been ordered deported nine times  does the minister intend to deport this rapist nine times as well  how many innocent citizens must suffer because of government   in incompetence and uh inaction applause   the honurable minister of immigration  mister speaker the reform party takes great uh  it seems it takes great pleasure in seeing cases where it seeks to exploit it where we see cases and we try to fix the system that allows those cases to take place audience response   and the and there is a big difference because the gory details day in and day out mister speaker give no satisfaction and no pleasure to any member on this side as it doesn't give any pleasure and satisfaction to that side mister speaker  we have laws  we also have a process  we also move to deport individuals and we have  and we will further strengthen that  i will give a commitment to look into those individual cases but mister speaker i refuse to engage on the floor of the house of commons to give out justice reform party style applause   the honourable member for calgary northeast  supplemental mister speaker   while at the present time we are waiting for results from different consultation processes and studies i'd like to offer the minister the chance to show canadians his bite is as big as his bark as he has previously claimed audience laughter   the hearing for the once deported rapist my colleague referred to will be held at eight thirty a m tomorrow morning  will this minister stop this hearing immediately deport this individual and guarantee canadians that he will never ever enter canada again applause   the honurable minister of immigration  mister speaker uh firstly i'm i'm i'm   not aware of the individual case  secondly if the honourable member is as concerned about this case as he demonstrates on the floor of the house of commons i caution him that that excitement can in f in in fact throw the case out because he and other members could be in contempt of court  and why don't you audience commotion   why don't you  firstly why don't you settle down  maybe you should settle down firstly  and secondly   secondly if we do have the case at heart and we want to create justice don't be in contempt of court and don't give that individual any further legal angles applause   i'm sure uh all honourable members will want to include the speaker in their in their answers and in their questions absolutely  french introduction   french, 20 seconds   the honourable minister of transport  french, 25 seconds   i want to say mister speaker that uh although we don't have any regulatory power on this particular issue uh it is with a great degree of sadness that we learned of this kind of situation having developed in haiti  if in fact if in fact the uh  the uh allegations are correct  and we will want to inquire  and i'm sure that the carrier in question will want to explain uh the facts of the situation to make sure that canadians understand exactly what did take place  french introduction   french, 30 seconds   french introduction applause   mister speaker normally documentation is uh normally required after a refugee is accepted and upon landing  i think my officials and it would be uhh easily understood that i think documentation for a number of individuals is impossible if in fact they are too refugees and if they are in fact fleeing from that regime that documentation sometimes is an impossibility which is taken into account  the honourable member for prince george-peace river  applause   thank you mister speaker  my question is for the minister of justice  we have been told that law abiding firearms owners are the primary source of guns used in crime because their firearms can be stolen  accurate information regarding the sources of guns for criminals is necessary to determine if further firearms controls will reduce gun related crime yet the statistics are unavailable  mister speaker will the minister undertake a comprehensive national study to determine the source of firearms for criminal activities and will he make the information readily available to all canadians  applause   the honourab honourable  parliamentary secretary  mis mister speaker  we we we don't have accurate statistics on the availability of of firearms for illegal purposes  as the honourable member has said uh there are  st statistics those who say that uh most of the firearms that get into the hands of criminals are   are stolen  uh the the uh the official opposition yesterday said that it was uh smu smuggled  that w firearms smuggled across the border were the main concern  we are in the in the ministry of justice looking into this  the minister has uh given his undertaking that he will get as much information on this question as he possibly can and make it available to the house applause   the honourable member for yukon  word speaker  uh mister speaker my question is for the minister of transport  recently the minister gave an address uh outlining the government's plans to systematically dismantle the transportation system in this country and it should have been entitled goodbye to the national dream  mister speaker the minister calls his plan  commercialization but it is clear that he means  privatization and will affect seventy-five per cent of the department's activities  and i want to ask the minister to be clear with canadians  his policy clearly follows the tory royal commission on transport  and i'd like to ask the minister to explain how his plan to commercialize is different from the tory's plan to privatize which he opposed so vehemently in the last parliament  the honourable minister of transport  yes uh mister speaker i i want to assure uh my honourable colleague that there is no intention to dismantle the transportation system  what in fact we're trying to do mister speaker is to ensure that there is an integrated affordable transportation system available to canadians to move move both people and products  but i want to say to my honourable colleague that uh many uh people who follow the transportation scene will recognize uh in the commercialization approach that we are trying to maintain the government of canada's involvement in a supervisory a regulatory a a   policy uh way uh uh the the work that we're doing in transportation but we also understand that we have to have business and commercial practices applied to the way we do administer the transportation system  mister speaker the people who've been around ha   have seen former uh ministers of transport uh uh  of a of a liberal stripe attempt to do these kinds of things  it is not a tory agenda  it's an agenda designed to provide canada with a transportation system that will support the economy that's required to pay for the social programs that are at the heart of liberal policy applause   my colleagues i i have a i have a   point of order from uh the honourable government whip   thank you mister speaker  mister speaker i think you will find the unanimous consent to put forthwith all questions necessary to dispose of the report stage of bill c twenty-eight without further debate and to dispense the ringing of the bell on any record division   is there unanimous consent audience shouts "" agreed""   agreed and so ordered   french, 18 minutes   questions and comments  the honourable member for scarborough-agincourt   madam speaker i've been working on amendments to the young offenders act since the day i was elected  i want to share with my colleage across because some of the things that i have heard just certainly i could not comprehend  the the this particular act that we're dealing with right now was first tested in nineteen eighty-five when a young individual in my riding killed uh three people a mother a father and a seven-year old uh daughter  this young offender received in total three years  my constituents were just just just could  there were no words to describe their feelings  what i'm hearing from the honourable member is that the liberal party wanting to appease the re uh the the reform    madam speaker i don't think the liberal party brought this  this changes about because of the reform party  the liberal party long time was a a a a  beacon of changes to the to the young offenders act  and certainly i disagree with my colleague is saying  my colleague is saying that in a civilized and industrial world   we move from we should have something which is called  adolescent   well this young individual that snuffed snuffed madam speaker three lives he was not an adolescent  he had moved already into that particular world which is called an adult  he committed a crime   there's a saying that says you do the crime you pay the time   now i've heard with great interest the speaker the the my uh my honourable colleague saying that we don't need prisons we need rehabilitation and i cre i quite agree we need rehabilitation  but the one question that i have for the honurable member is the following  what in her view should a young offender get when that individual commits a severe crime such as a killing or a rape  do we say no no it's a nice nice young adolescent don't worry about it we're gonna going to   give you a pat on the back and you're not old enough to do it or are we gonna going to say to that adolescent you did the crime you gotta got to pay the time  more more at home madam speaker if a young offender were to kill a member of her family what would the honourable member precisely want to see the justice to be served and what kind of time should that young offender be paying  french introduction   french, 1 minute 30 seconds   le honorable dep   i'm sorry  the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby   thank you madam speaker  uhm uh my colleague in her speech mentioned that the preamble uh of the amendments to the young offenders act falls very short and i would just like her to comment what does my colleague from quebec say about what should be the balance between uh victim's needs and offender's needs uh as outlined uh in the preamble as to the general direction as to where the act uh should be administered  i notice that uhm the word victim i don't believe is not mentioned at all in the preamble and i would like her views on the balance between uhh victim's needs and offender's needs especially as it should be outlined in the preamble of the young offenders act  french introduction   french, 2 minutes 20 seconds   french introduction   french, 2 minutes 40 seconds   french introduction   french, 1 minute 50 seconds   resuming debate applause the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  madam speaker i'm pleased to rise uh and speak today in support of the government's recent actions cough to crack down on violent young offenders who commit serious crimes  madam speaker i'd like to uh sort of preambulate my speech by saying that we all have responsibilities in this country of canada that we shouldn't predicate the effectiveness of programs uhm on what our   p political agendas are  i think we have a responsibility for the young people of this country and this piece of legislation and the amendments are to clearly to address the needs that are there  uhm i must say that i'm happy to be a member of parliament and a contributing member so to speak that will perhaps add to a healthy debate  and makes viable suggestions that would fortify the country bring people together and to carve out a future for young people in this country rather than to talk about some rather destructive means uh that uhm would  not bring any enjoyment or any good health to the country such as it is  i'm pleased uh uh on june the second the minister of justice tabled amendments to the young offenders act  these amendments recognize the public's growing concern about  youth violence and demonstrate the priority this government places on protecting the public  these amendments uh by shifting the onus on young people to take responsibility for their violent crimes sends a strong signal to young people that their actions carry serious consequences "
Canada	 we're a country that basically wants canadians to know that we all have a responsibility for our country and consequently for our actions  however as the minister of justice uh made clear legislation is only one part of the answer to violence among young people  protecting the public is the primary and necessary objective but we must focus our attention on helping our young people if we are to find lasting and effective solutions to youth crime  i'm encouraged to see that the amendments to the young offenders act include provisions for the rehabilitation and treatment of young offenders in the community  there are many complex questions surrounding yet  youth crime questions that the standing committee on  justi justice and legal affairs will be examining as part of the reform of the youth justice system  i will i welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues in the house to take action on the contributing factors to to crime and violence such as unemployment poverty alcoholism drug and substance abuse family violence racism and illiteracy  this is not to say that any of those one factors are justify uh justify any kind of violent crimes or should contribute to uh saying that young people have the right to commit crimes  that really isn't  these are mitigating factors  these are things that make it very difficult for young people to have a life that's well a life that's healthy and a life that keeps them from that side of uhm uhm the negative side of life so to speak  socioeconomic misery and crime are two sides of the same coin  by addressing these problems in our society we will be tackling  the root causes of youth crime and ultimately adult crime  it does not take any stretch of the imagination to see how such socioeconomic misery fuels anger frustration anti-social behaviour and criminal activity a young among young people   i would like the house to consider the adverse conditions  of many of our aborig that many of our aboriginal youth  face as they walk through the perilous path to adulthood  unemployment among aboriginal people is twice the canadian level  it is the number one problem facing aboriginal communities and they have the lowest incomes of anyone in the country  illiteracy rate among aboriginal people is twice the national average  high school dropout rates can be as high as ninety-five per cent in isolated northern communities  fifty-seven point seven per cent of aboriginal people are  under the age years under the age of twenty of twenty-four   the aboriginal population is very young growing fast and on the move  the majority of aboriginal peoples do not live on reserves and the migration of on-reserve aboriginal peoples to urban centres particularly in western canada is increasing  in manitoba it is estimated that one out of four new entrants into the job market will be of aboriginal origin  in saskatchewan it will be one out of three  are they destined for a life of unemployment social problems crime  the odds seem stacked against them but this not need be the case  five to six times the number of aboriginal peoples are incarcerated in provincial and federal institutions as compared to aboriginal peoples in the general population  yet aboriginal peoples only represent approximately three point seven per cent of the canadian population  the state of many aboriginal peoples in canada is not a pretty picture  despite these socioeconomic problems progress has been made in health education economic community development and social services  such progress is often linked to aboriginal peoples having culturally appropriate services controlled by aboriginal peoples  i'm proud to be a part of a government that recognizes the enormous potential that our young people offer have to offer   and that is prepared to invest in their abilities and to give them hope and opportunities for the future  this government has implemented a number of programs and services we feel that will help aboriginal youth and other youth as well recognize their strengths and grow to their full potential and to see the sun on the horizon in an optimistic uhm manner  i as secretary of state for training and youth along with the minister of human resources development we have announced a youth strategy  this strategy will attack some of the root causes for turning  youth into young offenders  in my riding uhm madam speaker last month uhm we made ah a contribution to ah a youth program with the gwich'in people  the gwich'in people have taken it upon themselves to build their own healing centre to deal with many of their social and justice issues many of their health issues  and they have done so ah along with the partnerships  they're that they're building with people who have the expertise from in and outside of their own communities  last month we announced thirty-seven projects as part of the first wave of youth service canada  we feel it's necessary to send a signal out there that young people can be contributing to their community and not taking away from their community with what many uh many attribute to young people as being very negative as only young offenders tend to get all of the stories and all of the ink and all of the news media covering them  there are many young people out there who are doing wonderful things who are not being celebrated and who are not being recognized  youth service canada aims to help eighteen to twenty-four  years year olds gain work experience develop their skills learn good work habits improve their self-esteem through community service projects  i wish you to know madam speaker that youth service canada should provide opportunities for youth to break away from the socioeconomic factors which have held them back and have seduced them into some life of uh uh some life in some who have uh basically become involved in a life of crime   just recently madam speaker it should be noted that i attended the university of calgary's graduation uh for their native students  they graduated eighteen native students with university  d university degrees some of them with a bachelor of social work some of them with a bachelor of education  there was a young girl there who or a young woman who uhm uh graduated with an engineering degree  those young people are very healthy models outstanding citizens who will help their communities and this country as well  so far madam speaker it's not all bad news  amongst these eighteen uh people that uhm that  graduated from the university of calgary they did so under the leadership of uh one mister rob carion who works with native students across this country who works on the uh calgary police commission and contributes in a number of ways  but it takes leadership and it takes caring  it takes generosity that uh that expressed   to these young peop young people to encourage them to let them know that the government cares that people in their community care that we in this house my hol  honourable colleagues and along with myself care about them and are directing our efforts to deal with those things  thus far madam speaker across canada from all the colleges and universities we have graduated ninety-two thousand aboriginal graduates from universities and colleges  that's quite a huge cadre of professionals who would contribute in some way to their community  on monday i was reading the newspaper from the ed   edmonton j journal  madam speaker and in there they featured also the graduation of native law students  there were about five or of them on the front of this  and i knew most of them uh but the one that sort of leaped out at me was uh none other than mister josh tanguay from the northwest territories an already twenty year veteran a native student a twenty year veteran of the r c m p royal canadian mounted police who's contributed to his community and to his country  he's a proud canadian who's worked hard for law and order in this country  he's a proud canadian who has worked for his young people in his community  he's a model for these young people  that is how it's done  success is the way in the native communities to bring further successes  so these ninety-two thousand people that have graduated thus far  along with these law students who were uhm uh on the uh front of the edmonton journal is the way to go  there's more than one way to deal with the whole issue of  uh of young offenders and the whole issue of social justice and and a number of other justice issues as well  there is rehabilitated but there's also the way of leadership young people who set an example as these people will do  madam speaker uhm a part of the consultations uh on the concept of youth ser service canada had me  in in contact with many youth across this country hundreds of groups that i met with  and i had the occasion to go to the stadium  uh we talk about all the bad things that are happening madam speaker  i went to uhm uhm ah a to the stadium in in toronto the skydome  there were fifty thousand young people at the skydome  these young people were there with their school boards and these fifty thousand young people were celebrating in a positive way what they call the journey of hope  and they were accompanied by their teachers  this was a positive uhm uh a positive  celebration to show that young people in this country are not just involved in crimes that they are doing many wonderful things  i had the occasion to be at many many uh graduations across the country many of which involved aboriginal youth but many which involve ordinary canadian citizens across this country  it's positive  it's it's wonderful to see people doing something constructive which they get no credit for  so i'd just like to celebrate that with you madam speaker and uh my honourable colleagues here  speaking about the uhm the youth service canada project i believe that every department every crown corporation will do its part to forge those ah partnerships that will produce healthier young people more well contributing young people across this country  in my language we have what's called dene tulu   dene tulu i speak a dene language and dene tulu is uh the path that you walk on  the path that you walk on madam speaker is the path of your own choosing  we've integrated that as one stream into the youth service corps because we need young people who have been marginalized who have been left out who have dropped out of the out of schools  they've dropped out of learning they've dropped out of the labour market and essentially they become so marginalized they drop out of life  we need to rebuild confidence  we have to get them back to work back to learning  and we have uh this stream called the dene tulu > which uh or which is called tulu which would have them contributing  it is uhm cough   whether the path that you choose is good or bad is really up to you  that's a dene form of justice  tulu is one of our four guiding themes for youth service canada project  tulu could directly assist those young offenders who are in community based rehabilitation programs  young offenders were also prominent at some of our consultations across canada along with the disabled and along with the s   the homeless youth  youth service canada is one part of the government's actions to help young people to make the transition from school to the workforce or to reintegrate into society  there are many attempts madam speaker that we could uh talk about that the government has put forward  we put forward a youth strategy  we have a youth internship program  on these uh very few days of the past we've been discussing the changes to the canada student loans program which will help young people to participate in a positive way in their learning for future jobs that they will engage in for building for i guess nation building ehm exercises in their community at the community level as well as in their region 
Canada	" for that reason uhm part of the youth internship approach is industry driven and involves the sectors of automotive repair logistics environment electrical manufacturing horticulture and tourism  aboriginal youth will benefit from the youth internship acquiring hands-on knowledge and skills required in today's workforce  the success of all our young people as they step into the adult world is crucial not only for their own self-esteem but also for the well-being and prosperity of society as a whole  the government stay-in-school aboriginal campaign is using innovative methods to increase public awareness and spur community action to reverse the appalling trend of having young people fall i guess basically drop out of school to the tune of ninety-five per cent in some areas as i've indicated  a lot of discussion that preceded these amendments to the young offenders act focused on violent crime and a need to get tough with young criminals but let's not lose sight of the fact that less than twenty per cent of the youth crimes are violent acts  m most they of course they get most of the attention because it's very unfortunate and uh it's uh it's very negative  that's what usually gets a lot of the ink and a lot of the air time  but let's not lose fact of the sight of the fact  that twenty percent less than twenty per cent   are violent acts  most most youth crimes are property and alcohol related  getting tough and throwing these young people behind bars is not the best anch answer in these situations necessarily  we're not saying that leniency is the answer  we're saying that perhaps there're other ways of forging relationships and partnerships that will help to reconstruct and rebuild communities  we as parents as well madam speaker have a responsibility  when a child is born and when a young child leaves the house to go to kindergarten you have no idea what that child will turn out but if you as a responsible member of the community don't do your level best don't do everything in your power to provide for that child the nurturing the love the guidance there's there really is almost a guarantee that you're sealing the fate of that person to a life of negativity  and uh and great downfall  even if you do everything right madam speaker there is no guarantee  if you don't do anything to help young people you're almost sealing their fate to a life that's really not very positive  so i encourage communities madam speaker i encourage all the people that affect young people  it takes one person in your life to have a positive impact on you  it could be a counsellor  it could be an r c m p royal canadian mounted police  officer  it could be a teacher  it could be a kindergarten teacher  it could be a friend an aunt or an uncle  somebody to reach out to a young person and to encourage and to be there madam speaker is what it takes sometimes  so i'd like to encourage people at the community level  remember that the responsibility is not just in legislation or amendments  the responsibility is the relationship we forge together as members of this country a wonderful country members of our communities wonderful and diverse communities that contribute to making life better for everyone  we have a responsibility for the future of this country and the future of this country is basically going to be drawn out through the young people that we nurture that we guide that we teach and that we leave uh the that we that the government and all of the governance that we leave behind us is in their hands is for them  we have that responsibility madam speaker  we have an onerous responsibility but if we do nothing i think that we will in this sense reap nothing  and i appeal to all of the people across the country to remember that laws are guides  they guide us  and we we work in the highest uh institution or court in this land and we are building laws and   and remaking laws and changing laws but we can't legislate caring and loving and nurturing the things that the countries have to give to ensure that the young offenders uh the situation with the young offenders is  bated uh abated   madam speaker thank you very much applause   questions and comments  the honourable member for peace river  thank you madam uh speaker   uh a question for the secretary of state  uh she's talked about a crackdown uh in this legislation that's coming forward and i certainly would like to know what uh type of crackdown is being proposed  and i know that my constituent who has written me a letter mister  paulsen who talks about the need for tougher  uhm tougher penalties  this gentleman is a grandfather who uh  his  he he says his two grandsons are repeat offenders and all they get is a slap on the wrist and he's uh   he's even scared to leave his home because he's been robbed by these two grandsons in the past  and i want to know what kind of crackdown you're speaking about here  these i know that you  you've suggested that only twenty-five per cent of the acts  are uhm are are violent but uhm i would put these in that violent class that the there there's  robberies involved  and uhm can you explain to to us and uh particularly to uh concerned canadians what type of crackdowns you're proposing  the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  uh madam speaker uh directly from the n   news release of the minister of justice uh who tabled the amendments on the young offenders the highlights of the bill include increased sentences for teenagers convicted of first or second degree murder in youth court to ten and seven years respectively dealing with sixteen and seventeen year olds charged with serious personal injury offences in adult court unless they can show a judge that public protection and rehabilitation can both be achieved through youth court extending the time that sixteen and seventeen year old young offenders who have been convicted of murder in an adult court must serve before they can be considered for parole  impro improved measures for information sharing between professionals like school officials and police with selected members of the public when public safety is at risk as well as retaining the record of serious young offenders provisions that will encourage rehabilitation and treatment of young offenders in the community when this is appropriate  madam speaker this does nos not  necessarily speak to the question that the member asked but i do believe over  in in the various communities that will be affected by this legislation and in the various provinces and territories there are people who the justice ministers uh on the provincial and territorial levels who are looking at attempts to better deal with young offenders in their own regions in their provinces  and what some of those attempts would be like having i guess community service work uh  and one suggestion that's proved quite viable in the aboriginal community that i might share with you is this  it has found that when when young offenders have been sent out on the land to do physical labour hard labour in camps where they've had to cut wood and haul water and do a lot of very physical work that the recidiv the recidivism  rate with those young offenders is virtually nil  that's not necessarily boot camp  they learn something  they learn how to survive  they learn coping sk coping skills   they regain their self-esteem  but those are the kind of ideas that are being entertained out there and i don't find them totally offensive madam s   madam speaker if they're coupled with other positive rehabilitative measures   french introduction   french, 4 minutes 20 seconds   the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  thank you madam speaker  uhm i'm i'm not sure that i would ever be capable of convincing the honourable member that anything the federal government does uh is going to be uh believable by him but madam speaker i'm sure that he'll recognize that since we've been in government that there has been a boost in the economy  we've created a hundred and eighty-three thousand jobs since we were elected  sixty-six thousand of those jobs have gone into quebec  uhm we've just had the signing of the infrastructure program recently madam speaker  our youth initiative is an initial first step madam speaker  we believe that uhm uhm that this is one way to uh stimulate uhm ah a very downtrodden and a very cynical group of young people who have been marginalized that we had to do something  we don't feel that in the five and half months we had that we have enough time to do all of the things that we should do  talk about consultation madam speaker  uhm this is a a a party who ah didn't agree with us interfering jurisdictionally by bringing forward this program  we had nothing but headaches and heartaches from them  now they want into the program  i'm glad  any time that the honourable member wants to put forward a proposal i would be more than happy to receive it  i would be happy to meet with him madam speaker outside of this chambers to discuss this program  i would be happy also to discuss all of the other programs we have because we have other programs  uh the government knows the opposition members know that we have a very difficult time  we're streamlining and we are uh restructuring and in some cases collapsing boards and uh getting rid of programs that would reduplicate or that would be duplicating other services  we're doing that and if it allows us to reallocate for other purposes which are positive which is what resulted in the youth service corps  we managed to maintain a level of service that's adequate for the public  i don't really know what the honourable member is complaining about but i'm certainly willing to work with him on in  in the future on all of these initiatives   french introduction   french, 2 minutes   and very briefly the honourable secretary of state for  training and youth   madam speaker this whole issue of young offenders is not an either-or  we are attempting to create a balance within the justice system especially as uh it pertains to young offenders  we're looking at some rehabilitative measures  we're not going to uh uhm you know uh lock up young people and throw away the key  we know that the costs for incarceration are prohibitive  i should know madam speaker in my riding and along with kenora-rainy river uh the honourable member uh from kenora-rainy river will attest to that we have the highest rate of recidivism of repeaters  we know what it costs to have peop people  incarcerated for long periods of time  the upkeep the costs are prohibitive  we know that so what we are attempting to do with the young offenders and so is the minister of justice is to attempt to create a balance to address the issues of violent crimes committed by young offenders and still maintain a section for rehabilitation  and as i indicated that the department of justice is not the only department that that has that responsibility  communities parents regions provinces as well as  uh uh as well as the honourable members in the house here have a responsibility to contribute in a positive way   point of order  point of order   the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby  uh thank you uh madam speaker  i'm wondering if i may have the unanimous consent of the house to ask uh just one brief question of my colleague audience responds "" agreed""   do we does the honourable member have the unanimous consent of the house   a allow the question  the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby  thank you madam speaker  uh can my colleague advise this house on behalf of the government do aboriginal young offenders need special attention for those likely to receive a custody sentence "
Canada	 is the required denunciation of custody different for native young offenders   the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  madam speaker i do believe that there's equal application of the law applied under the young offenders  uh i think that uh because of the rate of recidivism and the higher rates of uh incarceration for probably aboriginal peoples generally as i indicated the uh the uh the rate of incarceration exceeds uh the population level of aboriginal people for  for men in particular  i'm not sure that that pertains to to  young offenders but i would uh i would venture that it would be very close  having said that i don't think there's any special treatment  uh if there is any special treatment it's to create equality not to create inequality  that's because there's such inconsistencies and there's such marginalization right now that definitely there is a constitutional disadvantage applied to young aboriginal people if that is the case in fact  resuming debate  repeats in french   french introduction   french, 20 minutes applause   order  it is my duty pursuant to standing order thirty-eight to inform the house that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows the honourable member for hochelaga-maisonneuve monsieur  menard sur les droits de la personne   french partial statement   i'm sorry  the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby   thank you speaker  i'd like to address a question to my colleague  uh does he believe that the proposed amendments to the young offenders act in this bill go in the right direction and if he does not then what legislative provisions would he propose in addition to the usual   re request for more social programming and counselling services  if the bill says the wrong things and i believe he's taking that tack then what does he propose other than throwing more money at the problem with increased social services  french introduction  french, 3 minutes 20 seconds   questions and comments  the honourable member for berthier-montcalm   french, 2 minutes 30 seconds   french introduction  french, 1 minutes 50 seconds   resuming debate  the honourable member for swift current- make  maple creek-assiniboia   thank you madam speaker   two months ago ten years almost to the day after the passage of the young offenders act christopher bartleby was shot down in cold blood on an ottawa sidewalk   because he was the person who shot him was   a young offender we know very little bit very little about him   all we know is that he shot a man for a lark for fun   there was a big public outcry lots of calls for tougher law enforcement and the media and the usual brown shirted brigades of gun control lobbyists were braying that we should stop crime by getting tough on honest citizens   this is something like a man who has two dogs one vicious and one gentle   the vicious dog bites the postman and so to appease the postman the man shoots the gentle dog and then takes the vicious dog and tries to sweeten his temperament by overfeeding it   so what will happen to this young man   uh because of the date of the crime i presume that he will be tried under the old young offenders act but for the sake of this discussion let's say that he would be tried under the new one   now it's less likely under the new act than under the old that he will be tried in an adult court for the simple reason that the new law will lead to interminable court delays with new process of reverse onus that has been written into it   if he is convicted he will face a maximum of ten years in custody no minimum of which perhaps six years could be in closed custody  but judging on the way the laws have been enforced to date that's all rather hypothetical and somewhat unlikely  so what should be done with a person like that   now i respectfully suggest that murder by a sixteen year old is no less harmful to the victim than murder by an eighteen year old  therefore the penalties should be essentially the same   i am not suggesting immediate incarceration with older prisoners  where the young fellow would be the plaything of sexual predators  that constitutes cruel and unsual punishment by any standards  and is unworthy of a civilized society  but we should have institutions designed to serve specific age groups  we used to have these  they were called reform schools   now some honourable members may say oh but that's too expensive  we can't afford it  if we could rehabilitate some of these young hoodlums perhaps it would be money well spent   and it shouldn't be expensive anyway  it needn't be expensive because young people incarcerated in a reform school could do useful work including growing their own food which  prisoners adult prisoners in the penitentiaries used to do also and which we've done away with in most cases  why do we not go back to that   and when the young offender wasn't working to earn his keep he should be educated   go easy on the pool tables and t v  you know a fourteen year old young offender who is in open custody was recently quoted as saying it's easy time   quote continues   what is that young fellow learning about the justice system   now the proposed amendments to the young offenders act are in our opinion purely cosmetic a transparent attempt to pacify a public which is clamouring for meaningful change   the government's response to almost everyone's principal demand that the maximum age of application be lowered from seventeen years to fifteen years is to be sloughed off with a silly and meaningless compromise  requiring sixteen and seventeen year olds to establish through a tedious and expensive court process that they should not be tried in adult court for the most serious crimes murder attempted murder aggravated sexual assault and so on   the cost and confusion will be enormous a bonanza for lawyers  and since both reverse onus and judicial selectivity are involved some lawyers will probably be able to seek the spotlight and beef up their incomes by mounting a charter challenge   this is an act written by lawyers for lawyers   i think of the constituent who said rather plaintively  can't you pass a law down there forbidding lawyers to run for parliament    now in this house on june the sixth the honourable member for saint hubert said these motions will be similar to extradition proceedings   quote continues   now i rarely agree with anything the honourable member says but i certainly agree with that  she was spot on   of course her proposed solution differs from mine  she would continue to treat these louts like poor little misguided children subject to the same rules as thirteen and fourteen year olds   people of sixteen and seventeen aren't children for heaven's sake  they hold down jobs  they drive cars   they have babies with or without benefit of matrimony   and if they're unhappy in the parental home generous social welfare will in most provinces provide reasonable comf   reasonably comfortable independence   bill c thirty-seven rather than ensuring that these older young offenders will end up in adult court makes it less likely than ever because of the reasons i have cited   now i don't want to sound like a nagging parent saying when i was your age but at the age of seventeen i was working in a bush camp  swinging an axe to raise money so i could enter university and if anyone had dared to suggest to me that i was a child i would have been outraged  we do young people no favours by relieving them of responsibility  at the other end of the scale i can actually remember uh one of the honourable members opposite probably won't believe this but i can remember when i was ten to thirteen years old  my companions and i fought regularly but never dreamed of using the knives which as farm boys we all carried   we didn't try to maim each other   and we had an archaic code of conduct which might seem terribly quaint to the lawyers and social workers who have been trying to redesign our society   you didn't kick somebody who was down  you didn't pick on little kids or gang up on anyone and you never never never hit girls  in other words we knew the difference between right and wrong   so did my kids as recently as twenty years ago  and so i venture to say to the young savages who terrorize their weaker classmates vandalize property and give the finger to their powerless teachers to exempt ten and eleven year olds from the rules of civilized conduct is socially destructive madness  a child who gets away with it at ten or eleven years of age and whose parents aren't held legally accountable for his or her actions learns a lesson which all the prattling counsellors and dreamy eyed social workers in the world can't erase   now the minister tells us that section forty-three of the criminal code which protects parents who do care about their kids and use reasonable force to discipline them is up for review   what strange world does the liberal party inhabit   mister speak madam speaker  the road from uncorrected naughtiness to mean destructiveness to full   blown blown delinquency is short and it's straight  the government owes it to the children of canada and to the future of our society to re-enter the world of every day canadians   c thirty-seven is a start but only a start  let's get on with it  madam speaker i neglected to inform you that i am splitting my time  with the honourable member from red deer  i hope i can put that in now  i agree to accept it but you have already gone over  i i think we better get to questions and comments  questions and comments  all right  the honourable member for berthier-montcalm  french, 1 minute 45 seconds   the honourable member for swift current-maple creek-assiniboia   i thank the honourable member for his questions  uh he must be aware that reform schools or youth wings as he calls them do not exist anywhere in canada any more  uhm and i am advocating and i'm advocating strongly that doing away with them was a mistake because there is now no real mechanism to deal with these young people  you have the open custody situation or you have jails for adults  you really don't have much in between  you have youngsters in remand centres interminably  and uh they get into more trouble there  they get educated  that's why we should have reform schools where they get proper  education  and yes i am nostalgic   i do yearn for a period of our history when society was orderly when there was a discipline of children when the police and the courts had power and exercised it   uh i don't uh have a yearning for a police state but i do have a yearning for a state where people are safe where there is a social contract which involves decency a mutual respect among people  we have lost that and a lot of it is due to the same frame of mind that framed the original young offenders act and which did not have the courage to come forward and do a full job with c thirty seven   resuming debate  the honourable member for red deer  thank you madam speaker  canadians have waited a long time for this day  for years they have been demanding substantial changes to the young offenders act  canadians say they uh do not feel protected  they have asked the government to put society first instead of the criminal  canadians have demanded changes and canadians have waited  in the meantime there have been costs  the public confidence has been eroded  young offenders who have been released for violent crimes have reoffended  all the while canadians have appealed to the government to protect society and ensure offenders are rehabilitated before being released  the government has tabled before us amendments to the young offenders act which it says will address these concerns  the amendments would change the declaration of the young offenders act so that its primary objective is to protect society  madam speaker on the surface this looks good   the protection of soc society  should always be the objective of our criminal justice system  we as parliamentarians must ensure that the protect  protection of canadians is paramount 
Canada	 madam speaker bill c thirty-seven falls far short of this goal  we as reformers will be supporting the bill however because it does do because it does do something about toughening up the system  something is better than nothing  but there are problems madam speaker  the government's proposed changes are merely cosmetic  they appear to give the act a smooth finish but when we look beneath the surface we can see serious structural flaws  here are some of the flaws  bill c thirty-seven does not lower the age limit  those young offenders who commit serious crimes and who  a who are under age twelve are still not held criminally responsible even though criminal acts are committed by children under age twelve   all we need to do is look at the newspaper today  they tell a harrowing tale about an aylmer boy who held his classmates at gunpoint  the boy had a three fifty-seven magnum and nine millimetre pistol  he was ten years old and apparently threatening the lives of his classmates  yet he has not been charged because he is too young  in nineteen ninety-three regina police were paralysed to act after a nine year old and an eleven year old attacked two young boys  the victims were forcibly confined beaten and sexually abused  police could do nothing  parliament has not given them any power to act  and so the stories could go on and we've heard many many of them repeated here in this house  young offenders like these should be included in our youth criminal justice so that they can receive treatment so they can learn that their crimes are not acceptable to society so we can be assured they do not reoffend and finally so that they can eventually become productive members of the community  we have the chance to reform the violent actions of these young children but we are missing this window of opportunity  madam speaker bill c thirty-seven also fails in another area  it softens the law for violent offenders under age sixteen  the amendments we are considering today will allow youth courts to deal more harshly with murderers  indeed canadians across the country have demanded that the current five-year maximum sentence is a slap on the wrist  the proposed changes will increase first degree murder sentences to ten years  in reality this translates to six years of custody and four years of community supervision  second degree murder sentences will be increased to a seven-year maximum  this translates into four years in custody and three years of supervision  i would argue that these changes will work to soften the law in its treatment of murderers  the slightly higher sentences will mean fewer violent offenders under sixteen will be transferred to adult court  the changes before us today will ensure that many murderers will remain under the young offenders act  the government argues that its amendments are sufficient  it says most of the murder-related cases heard in youth court are committed by sixteen and seventeen year olds  in nineteen ninety-two and ninety-three sixty per cent of the cases heard in youth court involved this age group  these statistics like the amendments before us today look good at first glance but once we look a little deeper we see the blemishes  the numbers completely ignore an important fact mister   madam speaker  offenders under age sixteen committed forty per cent of the murder cases heard in youth court at this time  i would argue this is a significant proportion  there is yet another flaw in these amendments madam speaker  the general public is kept in the dark about violent repeat offenders  the proposed changes will provide information on young offenders to the police to school officials and child welfare workers  certain members of society whose safety is in jeopardy will also receive information on the young offender   these seem like valid changes but in reality they are superficial  the general public does not have access to this information  madam speaker if certain members of the public can receive information about a young offender because there are their  safety is at risk why is the general public not also informed  if there is a change a a chance a young offender will reoffend then all of society is at risk  it is impossible for anyone to know for certain that only a targeted few will be in danger  if this government truly is interested in protecting all of society then all of society should be informed about dangerous young offenders   this is not the case  an additional flaw is that violent young offenders' records are not kept on file permanently  the proposals also claim to protect society by allowing police to keep the record of young offenders on file for ten years instead of five  according to the justice department this change will ensure that the length of time a young offender's record is kept is in keeping with the seriousness of the offence  madam speaker keeping the young offender's murder record on file for ten years does not begin to mirror mirror the seriousness of the offence   murder is permanent  it demands a permanent record   it is fair madam speaker that the victims' names and ordeals be forever etched in the minds of their loved ones long after the murder record has been wiped clean  madam speaker society has the right to know  if this government is truly interested in protecting society it should keep all murder records and violent crime crime   records on file permanently   c thirty-seven also raises some questions about serving sentences in the community   will the community sentences be adequate  under the changes set before us today more non-violent offenders will serve their sentences in the community instead of in custody  this change has many attributes  young offenders will not be influenced by harder violent offenders  often jail is considered a training ground for crime   it will save government money  it costs approximately seventy-five thousand dollars to incarcerate an individual  but the government in saving this money must be committed to redirecting some of it into the communities  if these offenders are to live in our communities we must ensure that they do not become repeat offenders  we must protect society  to do this some of these offenders may need treatment and we must ensure that they receive it  i am not talking about spending more money  i'm talking about saving money and spending some of it more wisely  in conclusion madam speaker i would like to say that when we make changes in to our criminal justice system we must ensure that the system is predictable to society  in order for a judicial system to act as an effective deterrent citizens must be able to anticipate the outcome of their actions  it is therefore important that the young offenders act mirror the adult system as accurately as possible  we still have a long way to go especially in the area of criminal  uh records and publication bans  i believe these changes before us today are a small step toward this goal  bill c thirty-seven is far from perfect but it will improve the current system somewhat  amendments to bill c thirty-seven are essential and i would urge my fellow members of parliament to ensure that these are enacted  thank you applause   questions and comments  the honourable member for saskatoon-dundurn  thank you madam speaker  madam speaker uhh mention has been made about uh the   the negative effect of increasing the sentencing uh and uh that this will result in fewer individuals being transferred to adult court  perhaps i can remind the member madam speaker that uh the onus is reversed   a person such as that is automatically in adult court and must be transferred down to youth court or the young offenders court in the case of serious offences such as murder  and as well madam speaker there is mention made of the aylmer incident yesterday but no mention is ever made no mention whatsoever about the father and the parents  and what about those guns  how did they get into the hands  were they in the hands of law abiding individuals  were they in the hands of neighbours  how did they get into the hands of the children  perhaps we should stop blaming the ten year old and start blaming the adults that allow these guns to get into the hands of uh young people  and there is a lot of rhetoric madam speaker about rehabilitation and productivity to society but no substance  so my question to the honourable mensch  honourable member is what would you do  how would you change it  what specific items would you put into the act to deter  to deal with rehabilitation and to make this young person  productive to society   the honourable member for red deer  uh madam speaker th th  there's a lot of things we could say that we would change  uh we could we could certainly take a look at things like boot camps and those sorts of things  but i think more important to your question uh we must include  victims' impact statements   we must include uh parents in the actual criminal justice system itself  the parents have got to be forced to be there to hear what that victim went through to hear what their little darling did to that person and then they have to be part if they're found to be in any way responsible they have to be part of that restitution that money that's paid back  that that fence that's fixed that uh whatever that damage has been  they've got to be part of that  so i agree with you fully  we must involve the parents in this  we must involve the victims in this  and when we do that  and i don't see that in bill c thirty-seven  i see just a wishy-washy bill that really just  just satisfies the red book liberal pary platform claim that we're going to make some changes but will do nothing to improve the actual situation we've got applause   honourable member for berthier-montcalm  french, 1 minute 20 seconds   the honourable member for red deer  madam speaker i i'm not quite sure exactly what the member is referring to but obviously what we're saying is we don't abandon those children  in fact we've got to do something about that rehabilitation  we're already spending millions of dollars uh on social programs on various types of retraining programs and it's not working  it's just not working  and so we have to take a look then  we have a bunch of academics who have this idealistic world  uhm where they can get solutions of where they think they have solutions but it's not working  we have to look at other things and uh that's  that's just the point  the money we're putting in there now is being wasted   resuming debate  the honourable  i'm sorry  we have one minute  uh time for a question from the honourable uh parliamentary secretary   he didn't want a question  alright  resuming debate   the honourable member for airy erie  mister maloney  no  the honourable parliamentary secretary to uh the government  french, 1 minute 20 seconds   extra-corpus speaker, 6 minutes, 15 seconds applause  there are no questions and comments after the uh   after five thirty-one  word resuming debate  french introduction   french, 7 minutes 10 seconds applause   uh resuming debate  the honourable member for london-middlesex  thank you very much madam speaker  it's my pleasure to join in this uh debate today on the young offenders act and a muchly a much-needed new bill to improve that act  first of all let me congratulate the honourable minister of justice for this bill  as i say madam speaker it offers to canadians as part of a two-step plan some interim improvements to the youth justice system in this country  i think it's important madam speaker that we we  all as members recognize and acknowledge that as i say this will be a two-step process  this is not the final and finished product if you will  if it were i would simply say to the honourable uh minister that it doesn't go far enough in the ultimate sense but for now it is a very good and major step in the right direction 
Canada	 i think madam speaker it's important to note that the second phase will be a thorough review by a parliamentary committee and by a federal-provincial task force on the whole youth justice system and that there will be considerable public input in that review process as there was and as there has been so far to this point  obviously it's very important to involve provincial legislatures  and provincial justice officials because the legal system obviously is administered at both the federal and provincial levels   this bill offers some very badly needed improvements  the original young offenders act had an excellent rationale in my view  it was simply to recognize the fact that society in canada as a nation we ought to deal with the young offender in a way different from a more mature offender that the penalties ought to be different  that the where incarceration is required that there ought to be different facilities  and i think that canadians generally recognize that and accepted that rationale   unfortunately i think as we know on all sides of the house and as canadians from coast to coast to coast know the young offenders act has in at least a minority of cases been somewhat badly abused  there's not much question in my mind madam speaker when you see young offenders on national television in this country telling canadians that they consider the uh young offenders act as some  something of a joke and that they feel that uh the   when they're incarcerated that it's kind of like going to camp  and you hear that on national t v from young offenders repeat young offenders then it's no ques question   there's no doubt in my mind that canadians feel and rightly so that there are some problems with the current legislation  and that obviously is is why the minister the honourable minister is seeking uh to put forth these improvements as step one of the ultimate act that we will have in place in this country   if i might uh briefly consider the improvements that  that are offered in the uh proposed legislation  i think one of the major improvements is the provision that would put the onus on a sixteen or seventeen year old offender  convicted of a violent crime obviously especially murder the the   the onus will now be on that individual to convince the court why he or she should not be dealt with as an adult criminal in adult court and subject to the tougher penalties of law  that's an important change because obviously under the previous legislation or the current legislation that we seek to amend the reverse is true  a sixteen or seventeen year old convicted even of murder is dealt with on a much more lenient basis and is not tried in adult court  and this legislation will correct what i think most canadians consider to be a a gross inequity in that area  the the provision for murder or the penalty for murder madam speaker i would just recall for honourable members  that and for canadians generally that it started out at a mere three years for first degree murder  and in the area of my riding of london-middlesex we had a  we've had a a sad situation a few years ago where one young offender murdered i believe it was three people it was certainly more than one person and yet subject to a maximum total penalty of three years  that was clearly not just and is clearly not adequate for a serious crime like murder  and so the the penalty went from three years within the the last short period of time to five years but this legislation would uh would   allow a maximum penalty a doubling of that maximum penalty up to ten years  now some might still say that for for mur   murder for first degree murder ten years is inadequate and i suppose that's a debatable point but it's certainly far more just and f than the five-year  penalty that uh that it will prov that it  will replace   the under sixteen and seventeen year old offenders in  uh in that age category will will   not be eligible for parole as early if convicted of murder  in other words a young offender convicted of murder will now find it much more difficult to earn parole than he or she has under the current legislation  and again i think that that's that's  just common sense and and simple justice  so as i say madam speaker canadians know that there have been problems with the with the young offenders act and  they are they're crying out for improvements and i think the minister has offered major improvements as the first step of a two-step process  as our red book liberal party platform said during the uh election campaign and as the minister and the prime minister have continued to say and and members on uh this side of the house have continued to say since the uh election of october past that public safety must be the top priority as we address this issue  now let me be completely fair and say that i've heard that statement from all parts of the house and i agree with that that public safety must be the first consideration when we're considering the justice system in any part of the justice system and that includes the young offenders uh the uh those those offenders who are young canadians   as as its first priority   however where perhaps i differ as a liberal from some honourable members in the house is this  this party and this minister and this legislation seeks to find a balanced approach to this serious problem of youth crime  it's not enough to take to simply say  let's throw them in jail for as long as we would any other adult throw away the key and and uh let them rot in jail  that's not uh the answer  and we haven't heard that attitude too much in the house but   i'm i'm displeased to say that i have detected that that is uh kind of the approach of certain honourable members  and i would find it short-sighted because it's not a balanced approach   legislation alone will not solve this problem  it's certainly a key component of addressing this issue but it's not enough in and of itself  i think that we're very short-sighted as a nation if we don't seek to treat the root causes of youth crime the poverty that many if not most young offenders experience the very real poverty that most canadians don't experience a high percentage of young offenders have experienced in their lifetime the repeated family violence that they have experienced themselves often the victims of this violence both sexual and non-sexual violence   racism is unfortunately a real problem unfortunately and young offenders who are from a minority group when you analyse their background and analyze why they committed crime racism is a repeated theme in   in those particular uh young offenders from minority groups  the whole question of illiteracy and dropping out of school  i can tell you madam speaker as an educator for twenty-one years that the first sign that you may have a potential young offender on your hands teachers will tell you they uh those first symptoms if you will are exhibited in classrooms at the youngest ages at the lowest grades   and of course obviously as with criminals of all ages substance abuse by young offenders is a major factor uh in why that they are involved in criminal activity  madam speaker if one were to uh summarize these root causes   in in a brief phrase i think we could do no better than describe the dysfunctional family or the breakdown in the family and in good family values in this country in a mi i hope a minority of families  but an analysis of young offenders will show that a high percentage of them an overwhelming percentage of them come from dysfunctional families where there is not proper parental supervision where there is not proper parental inculcation of values with these young people  and so in effect if you will as a society we reap what we sow  and this party seeks to find a balanced approach so i applaud the minister and the legislation but i applaud the fact that he says time and again when he speaks to the house that we have to treat the root causes of crime otherwise we are not ultimately going to come up with an improvement in this important area  sure we will lock away young offenders for a longer time at great cost to the nation but that will not solve the problem which we ultimately hope to improve upon  and so madam speaker what we ought to do as a country and what the legislation seeks to do in my view is to while  improving the the legislation and coming up with more realistic penalties it seeks to not only uh be reactive to young offenders but it seeks to be to to uh put preventive action into place  and the sharing of information among professionals uh police officials school authorities that will be an important part of preventive action  i say as a teacher that uh that you know any teacher in this country knows there are young offenders in some cases violent young offenders walking around the halls of that particular school  and it's important that educators know that in the interests of the safety of the other students in that facility and of indeed staff in that school because it's a fact that there has been an increase in violent uh crime in schools in this country and it concerns all of us  and so madam speaker i uh i'm  pleased to join in the debate today and as i say i applaud the minister for the legislation  it's a major first step in the right direction and we will await as all canadians do the ultimate improvements in the young offenders act  thank you very much applause   it being six oh five p m the house will now proceed to the consideration of private members' business as listed on today's order paper  mister bachand     word   oops sorry     short french statement   short french statement and introduction   french, long statement, at least 10 minutes  applause   the honourable parliamentary secretary to the leader of the government in the house of commons  french, 50 seconds   however i'd like to uh uhm stress that a reliable and affordable a reliable and affordable food distribution system is critical to the health and well-being of tens of thousands of canadians living in northern isolated communities  and so this issue is one that uhh must concern us as a national legislature in in canada  here in the south the issue of food distribution is not as significant for one or either uh of governments or residents  nutritious food is broadly available at supermarkets or corner stores throughout the areas in southern canada and distribution of food products is left in the hands of the private sector with no demand for or need for government involvement  however in the north the situation as the honourable member has indicated is dramatically different  many communities are isolated and do not have year round surface access so food supplies must be delivered in some cases by air  in other cases uh by sea and perishable foods which as a rule are the most nutritious are are very difficult to arrange for in some of these communities   the expense of transporting perishable foods to remote communities increases their cost to consumers  the honourable member provided the house with a list uh the variety of which i've seen in my northern experiences i must say  uh these areas are not only isolated but they're often economically depressed  in some communities unemployment is as high as eighty-five per cent uh and so many families are living on social assistance supplemented by   whatever community uh whatever commodities they can harvest from the land   uh northern food the northern food mail program therefore is vitally important madam speaker 
Canada	 it subsidizes the cost of shipping perishable nutritious foods to isolated northern communities and puts these basic necessities within the reach of northern families  and uh on many of the flights that i have taken to various places in the north i'm aware that the the plane is in many cases filled with bread eggs milk and other perishables that are shipped to these communities  however even with the assistance of this program it's extremely difficult for families to afford the proper and nutritious uh food that is demanded and without the program it would be virtually impossible to do so  and i again stress the list of prices that the honourable member uh listed  they are not exaggerated  and i'm not exaggerating when i say the situation in the north would be desperate without this uh without this program  government studies show that a family of four in isolated communities in the northwest territories would have to spend between two hundred and sixty to two hundred and eighty dollars a week or between eighty-five and a hundred and ten per cent of their after-shelter income for a basic diet  that's about twice the cost of a comparable basic diet here in southern canada  i'd remind honourable members that canada is a signatory to the united nations declaration on the rights of the child and one of those rights is the right to adequate nutrition  children should not go hungry especially in our country madam speaker  so there can be no question in my estimation as to the need for the program  the only question is what form the government subsidation for food distribution subsidization for food distribution  or food costs should be  ah we stress that it is essential for the health of northern residents  i think it's also fair to say that the current program is achieving its intended purpose notwithstanding the suggestions made by the honourable member  the northern food mail program is strongly supported by the communities it serves and by the food distribution companies the merchants which form part of the distribu  distribution system and of course consumers  canada post which ships food products and other essential goods by air has been a willing and vital partner in the program   in spite of all that i commend the honourable member for saint-jean for urging the government to reconsider the current northern food distribution system  there's always room for improvement and governments should be continually looking at new approaches to program delivery  i'm therefore extremely pleased to inform the house that the government has already taken steps to re-evaluate this program  in april the minister of indian affairs and northern development  and the minister of health committed their departments to a full review of this essential service for the next year   this review will build on an evaluation of the program that was undertaken by consultants last year  it will include consultations with all the key stakeholders including northern residents merchants air carriers provincial and territorial governments and aboriginal organizations  madam speaker this consultation process is fully in keeping with the red book liberal party platform commitment and i know the honourable member has read the red book extensively to ensure that aboriginal people are fully involved in decisions that affect their lives  toward this end regional consultation meetings will be held in the north this september and october  written views and recommendations will also be accepted by the government   my honourable colleague will be particularly pleased to hear that an interdepartmental committee is currently looking at terms of reference to guide this review  in addition to health canada and indian and northern affairs canada the committee has representations from the departments of finance agriculture and human resources development the treasury board and the privy council office  madam speaker this review will look at the issue of food distribution in the north from a very broad puss perspective    it will not just consider how much money is being spent or needs to be spent under the northern food mail program  it will address the fundamental question of whether or not this is the best way to ensure that northerners can meet their needs for food and other essential goods that are currently shipped under the program  it will review alternatives for food distribution and food costs subsidization including income support to ensure that people have money to buy the essential foods  the role of local food production processing and inter-settlement trade will also be considered  the review may in the end tell us that the essential structure of the program is solid but that some fine tuning is needed  it may tell us that a completely new approach is needed or that the program should be developed uh and and looked after by another level of government or indeed by an independent organization  in the meantime madam speaker honourable members have the government's assurance that funding for the program in its current format will continue  in nineteen ninety-four and ninety-five a total of fourteen point one million dollars will be available for the food mail program  the bulk of this some thirteen point six million dollars will come from the department of indian affairs and northern development  the remaining five hundred thousand dollars will be det  contributed by health canada  this level of funding should be sufficient to maintain the postage rates at the current levels until march thirty-first nineteen ninety-five  in in conclusion madam speaker i want to say that i of course am not an expert on this subject  i've had some experience as i have indicated in the course of my remarks but i'm not an expert and the remarks that i am alluding to and that i am s in part reading have been prepared for the parliamentary secretary to the minister of indian affairs and northern development who is tied up in a committee tonight and is u and is unable to be here in the house to deliver this particular speech  so i'm pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the speech really on his behalf and contribute to the debate on behalf of the uh government  and i i would like to say in conclusion that this house must acknowledge that the northern food mail program has proven to be an effective and efficient way of making food and other essential goods more affordable in in  isolated northern communities  as a member who travels there occasionally i am pleased to support it  and i'm confident that if any improvements can be made either in the short term or in the long term they will be identified in the course of the review that the government is has under way at the moment and which will be reporting in due course  i thank the honourable member for raising this issue in the house  applause   the honourable member for wetaskiwin   thank you madam speaker   i'm uh pleased to be able to participate in this debate uh on the motion presented by my honourable colleague the member from saint-jean  the motion before us today uh asks the government to make food distribution in canada's more uh north more effective and uh more economical  and i i couldn't help but notice that uh the uh member who spoke just before me must've  we must have been doing research from exactly the same uh material madam speaker because uh his speech sounded an awful lot like the one that i'm about to deliver   we in the reform party are always looking for ways to improve on existing programs  and and i'd like to commend the honourable member for his initiative in bringing this motion uh forward   since the nineteen sixties the federal government in conjunction with the uhm post office has made an effort to supply uh   n northern isolated northern  communities with affordable fresh produce  under the northern air stage program the department of indian and northern affairs department of indian affairs and northern development pays canada post a subsidy to cover a portion of the cost of bringing nutritious mostly perishable food to communities that have no year round road or rail access   approximately a hundred and twenty-five communities serving about eighty-six thousand people are eligible under this program  as has been referred to here previously madam speaker the nineteen ninety-four fiscal year this food mail subsidy will amount to some fourteen point one million dollars  of this thirteen point six million will be coming from the department of indian and northern affairs with about a half a million dollars coming from the department of health   the residents of canada's north face not only higher retail prices than we southerners but uhm they also have a critical employment program   work is at best seasonal at nature in nature    most work that is in that area  in the nineteen nine eighty-six census showed that only thirty-five per cent of the aboriginal population fifteen years of age or older were employed compared to sixty per cent for all of canada in the same age category   so of course a high unemployment rate means a lower annual wage and  cough ultimately less purchasing power   the high cost of transporting goods in the north even with the government subsidized food mail program results in higher consumer prices  a family of four and uh also has been alluded to here earlier in these isolated communities in the in the northwest territories would have to spend between two hundred and sixty and two hundred and eighty dollars per week just for a basic diet  and uh uh it's at least twice as much as we would have to spend in southern canada for the same diet   a study by the department of indian and northern affairs canada conducted in nineteen ninety concluded that by reducing the merchant's transportation costs the air strategy subsidy has been an effective means of keeping the prices of food and other goods in remote areas lower than they otherwise would be   the study also found that an elimination of the subsidy would likely result in higher social assistance costs madam speaker higher health care costs and an increase in isolated post allowances for government employees   but madam speaker when the department of indian and northern affairs launched this study in nineteen ninety there were no uh apparent alternatives  today i believe that uh as was indicated by my honourable friend there may be a practical cost-effective solution for at least part of this problem  there is a cough   excuse me  there is a ah corporation madam speaker as was also alluded to by the mover of this motion that is prepared to establish a food distribution network  and uh certainly don't want to uh uh propose one corporation over another madam speaker but uh where there is one there's likely to be others  this corporation plans to subsidize or to supply food from a central distribution centre in iqaluit cough   i didn't say that right   uh which uh in the outset would serve uh   in in iqaluit which would at the outset serve some thirty-eight northern communities   this unique canadian enterprise predicts that the price of food products in the north could be reduced by ten to twenty per cent   this will be possible because of their plan to reduce transportation costs and because their purchasing power will enable them to negotiate lower prices and to pass the savings on to the customers   now this company expects to save on transportation costs by regrouping products and chartering aircraft that would carry up to seventy-five thousand dollars worth of merchandise per flight  while their plan initially is is to be a food wholesaler they estimate that they can receive eighty-eight per cent of the market share in two years by supplying perishable foods   uh food products and other consumer merchandise needed by northern residents but not currently available at reasonable prices   the overall cost to inaugurate the service is est   estimated to be some one million six hundred and fifty thousand dollars  and without going into too much of the of the   financing madam speaker it is safe to say that uh they would probably need some government uh loan guarantee in order to uhm get them started 
Canada	 but i think the the operative word here is a loan   and ah as also was mentioned by the mover of the motion  this uhm this company is uh uh would  create some jobs for some people in the north and it is  al they're also all are shareholders of this particular company   so what the benefit is this for the canadian government  the company's pros prospectus  predicts initial savings for the government of up to three point six million dollars and they expect to train and employ as was mentioned before about fifty-five local people   now as you know madam speaker we in the reform party are strong believers in the free enterprise system and i'm personally pleased to see that this group has taken the initiative to provide a better service to at least some of the isolated northern communities  and to me it sounds like ah an excellent viable alternative   if they are successful it is likely that other entrepreneurs would follow their lead and there would uh be no need for the government of canada to provide so much subsidy to canada post for the food mail program   madam speaker if this had been ah a votable motion i would uh have asked uh that it be referred to committee  i would encourage our party to support this motion and refer it to a committee for further examination  since it is not a votable motion i would like to encourage the government  and i was very pleased to hear uh the member opposite say that uh they they do have plans to review and to look at this uh this whole uh uhm program and   i i hope these proposals   uh but madam speaker that's certainly what i would encourage is that the government look at every possible proposal to make the food distribution in the north far more efficient and effective and  as well as improving the the  quality of the food and the diet ultimately of the people who live in the north  thank you madam speaker  the honourable member for saskatoon-dundurn  thank you madam speaker  i rise to address the house on the motion put forth by the honourable member for saint-jean   as my honourable colleague has explained the northern air stage program is critical to the good health of many thousands of people living in remote northern communities  it is also a federal initiative that is not well known to many canadians or to their representatives in this house  i would like to take this opportunity to provide some background on the program so that honourable members can fully appreciate its importance  the principal objective of the northern air stage program is to achieve food security in isolated northern communities  food security is defined as a condition in which all people at all times have access to safe nutritiously adequate and personally acceptable foods in a manner which maintains human dignity  food security poses special challenges in northern canada where southern food is very expensive and retail competition is extremely limited  there are also increasing pressures on traditional food sources as well as concern about contaminants in the food chain  hunting itself is expensive especially for people who are already in low-paying jobs or are receiving social assistance  under the northern air stage program madam speaker the department of indian affairs and northern development makes payments to canada post to subsidize the cost of providing air parcel service to communities that are not accessible by year round surface transportation  this payment covers between fifty and sixty per cent of the cost of sending these parcels most of which are food items which is why the program is more commonly referred to as the northern food mail program  this program has become a vital element of the northern food distribution system  it ensures that supplies of nutritious perishable food are delivered to about forty-five inuit communities in the northwest territories northern quebec and labrador  it also serves about sixty isolated first nation communities in the james bay region of quebec in ontario manitoba saskatchewan and the northwest territories and about twenty mainly non-aboriginal communities in labrador and the north shore region of quebec  in total some eighty-six thousand canadians depend on the program  madam speaker in nineteen eighty-nine the previous government announced that the food mail program would be phased out after more than two decades of existence  as might be expected this announcement was met with a great deal of opposition both in the north and in this house and the government decided instead to undertake a major review of the program  as a result of this review steps have been taken to make the program more equitable in terms of the subsidization rates paid for parcel delivery to communities in the northwest territories compared to the provinces  the postage rates for shipments to the territories had traditionally been about three times as high as in the provinces  important changes have also been made in how funding is applied  the lowest postage rates are now provided for nutritious perishable food and food of little nutritional value has been disqualified from funding  as well shipments of alcohol and tobacco products are not subsidized under this program  merchants or individuals must a commercial air cargo service winter roads or seasonal marine service for the re-supply of these items  as a result of these changes canada post now charges eighty cents per kilogram plus seventy-five cents per parcel for nutritious perishable food deliveries to all remote northern communities  non-perishable food and non-food items can be mailed to isolated communities in the northern parts of the provinces for one dollar per kilogram plus seventy-five cents per parcel  in the territories the rate for these items has been maintained at two dollars and fifteen cents per kilogram plus seventy five cents per parcel  madam speaker these changes have helped to reduce the prices of perishable food in the northwest territories  in some communities there has been a fairly significant reduction in the total cost of the basic northern food basket for a family of four  in pond inl inlet for example the cost of this basket de decreased by more than thirty dollars between nineteen ninety-one and nineteen ninety-three  unfortunately there are many communities in which increases in the cost of non-perishable food have offset the reductions in the cost of perishables   the lack of retail competition in many communities also continues to affect food prices  broughton island where the local co-operative closed leaving only one store in the community the cost of the northern food basket actually increased by forty dollars between nineteen nine ninety-two  and nineteen ninety-three despite the reduction in postal rates for perishables  from a nu nutritional  perspective madam speaker consumption of perishable food in inuit communities in the northwest territories has increased significantly since the postage rates began to decline in october nineteen ninety-one  in nineteen ninety-one ninety-two canada post shipped seven hundred and fifty-eight tonnes of perishable food to the ten communities in the baffin region which have traditionally been on the food mail system  the following year when postage rates were further reduced these shipments increased by more than thirty-five per cent to a thousand and forty tonnes  despite this increased consumption there is still a great deal of room for improvement  a government survey of isolated aboriginal communities taken in nineteen ninety-one and ninety nineteen ninety-three   shows that the per capita consumption of store-bought perishable food continues to be much lower in the north than in southern canada  as a result the average intake of vitamin a and calcium is far below recommended levels and the average consumption of sugar in all communities is extremely high  this is obviously undermining the health of northern residents  it is also evident that high food costs continue to be the major impediment to improved diets in the north  in the same survey i mentioned a moment ago between forty and fifty per cent of women reported that they were extremely concerned about not having enough money for food  in most communities this was a greater concern than alcohol and drug abuse and family violence  the situation is obviously extremely difficult madam speaker but without the food mail program or some alternative it could be much worse  it is clear that some form of subsidization must continue for shipments of nutritious perishable food items to isolated northern communities  the residents of these communities already have many problems to deal with poverty overcrowding family violence alcohol substance   uh alcohol and substance abuse cultural disruption gambling and so on  hunger and poor health brought on by an inadequate food supply should not be added to the list  i want to reiterate that the government has already taken the action proposed by the honourable member for saint-jean   an interdepartmental committee is now developing the terms of reference for a fundamental review of the food mail program for the next year  i would urge my honourable colleagues to support this important initiative  the food mail program costs each canadian taxpayer an average of about one cent per week  this is a very small price to pay considering the enormous impact the program has on the health and the well-being of eighty-six thousand canadians  thank you madam speaker applause   french introduction   french, 8 minutes 40 seconds   there being no further members rising for debate and the motion not being designated as a votable item the time provided for the consideration of private members' business has now expired and the order is dropped from the order paper pursuant to standing order ninety-six one   the honourable member for crowfoot   thank you very much madam speaker cough   i have listened to the debates on this bill and i would like to direct the attention of the house to one important factor that i think has been left out of the of the speeches that i've heard so far and that is simply this   i believe that the government and p  this government and past governments have been expecting the justice system to do something that it was never designed to do   the justice system cannot prevent dysfunctional families  the justice system cannot prevent the negative aspects of society that lead to crime  the justice system was designed to pros  protect society against those individuals who move towards a life of crime and begin to commit criminal acts and to threaten the lives and the property of the people of this country  that's the role of the justice system   and what the social engineers have done for the last twenty years  has attempted to create a dual animal of some sort within the justice system that it was somehow responsible to prevent crime  well that's not what it was designed to do  there are other programs designed to keep people out of crime  social programs our educational systems our churches and other organizations they're the ones designed to input into our young people the ingredients needed for them to become successful productive human beings who respect the law and who will not violate the law  but the justice system is not designed to do that madam speaker  now cough madam speaker the attempts by the social engineers over the last twenty years to change the fundamental role of the justice system has corrupted the justice system it has corrupted the system to the point where it is no longer protecting the lives and the property of the citizens of this country   we have just heard recently from assistant commissioner rod stamler claiming that there's been such interference under the mulroney administration in the administration of the r c m p royal canadian mounted police as to impact upon the ability of the force to conduct investigations into political corruption   we look at the allan eagleson case as another example of the corruption of our justice system and those people responsible for its proper and fair administration  where evidence was laid before the authorities within this country nothing was done about it until the u s authorities begin to investigate  only then did the authorities in this country begin to take a proper look at the evidence that was before them 
Canada	 i gather it it is correct  that that you weren't married at at   the time of this incident  i was engaged yeah  you were engaged  so it was your fiancee that you were two words   that's right  and uh uh what does your father do  what's his name what does he do  my dad's uh his name is george harrison and uh he has he works for  two words   and is that what he's always done  farmer before that and crop insurance  and uh so uhm would there be in any any connection in which you would be called the boss's son  no confused sigh no  do you have some sort of connection uh   what is your relationship with frank lawson   is he a supervisor of yours or  no  no he owns bob's realty in wonderland   so he is an owner separate from from  your business   that's right   that's right  and who owns your bus the one   that you work for  harry harley harley   li   harley li   harley li   and uh do you have some personal connection with that person  no  okay  uh what what is your position in the company that you work for  realtor  okay uhm is there a hierarchy  do you have someone that supervises you or do you just  go in and   no   it's just the owner and then uh agents  okay and that's you've been here doing that same position for five and half years two or three words  with bob's realty yes  now uhm how often do they have these kind of golf tournaments  really   once a year  is it is it an annual event  uhm  like do they do they ha is it is it  the same event every year   like always   uhm not necessarily always at jack's   they move around  yeah  how often have you gone before  how many times  uhm maybe twice  does everybody go  uhm not always  uh do you have any of your expenses paid or is there  any anything that that sort of two words   no we pay all  you pay for the golfing  yeah  and you pay for the food  mm hmm  is there anything that's offered by bob's realty   laugh no we're a hundred percent each   now uhm i gather that uh you were going to be uhm with the men that you were golfing with uhm  hadn't you known them from before  uh yes through business yeah  would you call them friends of yours  uhm word associates mostly  like i didn't i'd see them at conventions  had you uh had you decided as a group that you would golf together at this tournament  uhm i don't know how they decided that cos i was late  cos i was working that morning  and so you just we   how did you find out who you were signed up to play with  when i got there  like they had could be have a list up that you read  yeah yeah  the word secretary yeah  and it so happened that you knew the people that you  were gonna going to be golfing with  yeah   yeah i know most of them  cos i been in the business   you know most of the realtors  yeah  okay  and uhm did you start with lunch at jack's   that's right  three words lunch with the person  yeah  were you meeting some people there or did they have a buffet of some kind  no they didn't have a buffet for lunch uh but uh everybody lunch was on your own but everybody was having lunch  so who did you join  like you were saying that you were late  uhm i was with some metropolis people and also the table next to ours was uh my foursome  kay okay and uhm did you consume some alcohol at lunch  yeah we had a coupla couple of beer  cos the rest of the day was done  what do you mean the rest of the day was done  well for for work  oh i see you weren't you weren't  working anymore so you were now socializing is that what you mean  sure  and so you had a couple of beer  mm hmm  do you know exactly how much you had to drink at  two beers  two beers  yeah  and uh did the rest of your party that you would be golfing with later do you know whether they had anything to drink as well  i'm not sure  you were not sitting with them  no  okay  uh did you have any other alcohol to drink over the course of the afternoon  uhm a coupla couple of beer throughout the the game  and uh under what circumstances did you do that  are you able to drink while you're actually golfing  yeah  and how does that work  does somebody come around serving alcohol  uh then they didn't  we had to we went to uh once we went around   the first time uh we stopped at the little confe  confectionery and we picked up some beer from there  and uh so when you were close enough you would   you would get  yeah  do you know how many times you did that  uh well i had a coupla couple of  beer throughout the game so maybe twice  and uh so and yeah what time were you planning to be finished your game  what time did you guys think you'd be done  well usually it's uh uh eighteen holes but texas scramble is a little faster than an ordinary game because you bring up the balls to the best shot and uh probably anywhere from four to five hours five and half hours  but so you played the game  i'm asking you you know what time was it that you got done  when did you finish at  five thirty  cough so at the time that this whole incident happened within the word you had been drinking all through it   yeah well yeah i think so  and uh did you uhm did anybody  approach you or advise you that the the the problems or that  jane had felt there was a problem  actually when after the game when i   put my equipment away and i changed my shoes and so on i went back  to for the banquet which started at six  six thirty  that's when harley harley li came up to me and says you know uh there's been a complaint about you on the golf course  and uh that's where he says you know just and i said well  let's you know let's talk about it and he says no let's just forget it and uh uh better leave he said   that would be for the   so that's what you did  yeah  so i gather that you must have been quite confused at that point  i was uhm embarrassed yeah  so the other people who that you were golfing with did they know what had happened that you were  ha that you were were they nearby or did you tell them  i didn't have a chance to talk to them  i was actually embarrassed  and you left  that's right  so you don't know whether the rest of your uh group found out  no  about you don't know anything about that  no  now uhm during the course of the uhm the day that that you described uhm are you able to tell us whether or not at that point the people that you were golfing with whether or not they were drinking  were they also  well we had a again we had a   coupla couple of drinks yeah  they were  i'm asking you if you word   same same same yeah  okay pause about 15 seconds   now uh you say that you uh that you uh   are good with faces but i gather the first time that uh jane  came round you didn't recognize her  no  and uh and the second time   that that she came by or the time that   that two or three words are talking about uh again you didn't recognize her after she'd used your name  after she said pierre then i i i  looked at her and i thought oh i i   kinda kind of know her maybe and so i went up to her and we started talking and that's where it all came back to me  okay now when you went up to her and started talking to her uhh exactly what did you talk about  basically whoville about the whoville  and i told her i was engaged uh talked to her to see if sh  to see if she was still going out with uh  mi uh his name is mi mike   mike uh i dunno don't know  his last name simpson   and uh uhm when you were you were standing by her cart while she was sitting in it and you were drinking with her  that's right  she didn't get out of her cart at that point   no  and you say the other the other  people that you were golfing with were also there  yes  frank and mark and steve  were nearby as well  yeah   mm hmm  was is it possible that someone was purchasing something from her something to drink at that time  or or you just didn't see anything like that happen  no  no  you don't know  no i don't know  okay  uh so the other people that you were with would have been around for the rest of that conversation  yes pause about 12 seconds   and uh uhm how much time did you actually spend talking to her   not very long because we had just like i said we had just shot uhm our we just drove our balls and that's putting the club away then i went and talked to her and then those guys finished putting their clubs away and then  that's they took off and then that's when i asked her for a ride  did they tell you that they were leaving  yeah we're outta out of here  is there a reason why they left without you  they were probably bugging   i dunno don't know   they left   you're and uh it's your evidence  that uh that jane agreed to give you a ride  that's right  i wouldna wouldn't have went on the cart if she woulda would have told me no pause about 15 seconds   i gather that during the once that you you say you drove to this other spot i gather that once you were there you were close to where jane was the whole time that she was at that location  yeah  is that right  yeah  so anything that happened in relation to her you would have observed  i thought i did  well perhaps you could you could  just be clear for us  is there some way you could have missed something that happened  well mind you there's we  weren't concentrating on her  like we were golfing uhm  may like the conversation with  frank lawson i didn't uh i didn't hear or overhear anything of that kind so  so uhm so i guess  what uh is what you're saying is that when you got to the spot you got up and left and went to actually golf on the course  well i went back to my cart wasn't far like it was right beside basically on the right hand side so i just basically went there uhm check my club which club i'm gonna going to   use   that's what we do when we golf  so you left whe you got off of   her cart went over to to your cart  mm hmm  and you were looking at your golf equipment  mm hmm  and that you say it's during that  time frame that that frank had some sort of a conversation with jane   i yeah  and you're saying that you were unable to hear that  no  now was there a reason why you couldn't hear what the conversation was about  i wasn't paying attention  what were you paying attention to  golfing  well what do you mean by that word   well i was thinking of what my next shot and what my next uh club i'm gonna going to use   there's fifteen other clubs so i was trying to figure out which club i was gonna going to use  so you were standing looking at your golf cart clubs and thinking  is that what you're saying  yeah  and that's why you couldn't hear what   what was going on  that's right pause about 10 seconds   and then you say you went back to where jane was  that's right  back to her cart  why did you do that   to see what was going on  i don't know i just went back clears throat   well when you looked when you looked   at her cart what was going on  who was there  what was happening  when i got there she was standing and that's where   i i said oh another hug  so i gave another hug and that's when i hugged her again  okay well i'll just stop you there  if you look back she was standing  where was frank   right by his cart  so he was no longer talking to her  uhh no 
Canada	 they were they were talking but   they were they weren't no longer talking no   okay well i think uh i'll get you to just look at the uh photograph word so that we can be clear  if you can tell us first of all uh where uhm  where was the cart that jane's cart   when she stopped  okay  if you turn it around and so the judge can see where you're   pointing   yeah   uhm actually uh the bottom of where the pavement is  where the pavement turns into gravel  and there   that's right  and my cart well frank's cart was in front and behind there was uh steve's and uh ro jackson's  cart  and that's we pulled on to the side between the two sides two carts   okay so   so jane stopped right on the path  jane stopped her cart on the path   yeah because these two  these two carts were basically right along the  the rope   okay  yeah  so uhm were they in front one in front of the other  you know   yeah   in a line  yeah  but off the path you're saying  yeah  pulled off on to the on to the  grass by the ropes you're saying  well not totally off the path but maybe two wheels were touching the path like you know  okay  enough for lots of room for  and who was first in line  my cart  frank the one that frank   and you were in   frank yeah   and then the next cart was mark and steve's   that's right yeah  how far apart were they one to the other   four or five feet  okay  and then the next one is word jane's  cart and right on the path  is that what you're saying  basically yeah two wheels on the path and two wheels on the grass  jane   yeah  you're saying that she pulled uh in a line uh with the three oth with the two other carts  yeah  so they were all in a line together  no no like there was mine mark and jane  's here  that's what i'm asking  okay  was hers over on to the more on to the   path  yeah yeah okay  how far back from the next cart up was her cart  basically in between  like this is ours and like because when i walked over i just went basically to my   cos my clubs were right here   so when you were ta when you were going and studying your clubs you were at you were at the first cart in line   is that right  that's right  okay  so when you when you went to go uh uhm talk to jane again where was frank   right by his cart  right by our cart there  so uhm had frank come up to you when you were at the cart  no  he basically didn't he was just there  after he talked to her he was still there  he was still where  right beside his cart  by his cart  by our cart sorry  well weren't you at your cart   i was behind our cart because our clubs the clubs are behind the cart  mm hmm  yeah  well uh i guess i'm not understanding what does  frank what is your evidence that when you were looking at your golf clubs that frank was over at jane 's  cart talking to her  uhm i'll i'll explain again here  alright  our my our cart was here her cart was here he was right beside his cart  he was close enough to make have a conversation with her there  uh huh where was mark and steve's cart  i thought that was two or three words   no this is hers this is ma uh  ours mark and frank's is right here  uh mark and steve's are right here   was she pulled up beside you say she pulled up beside the two carts so word   that's right   she was not behind them she was beside them  yeah beside them no   beside them yeah  so was she in between the two  that's right  okay alright   so frank hadn't moved but he was having a conversation with her from your cart  is that what you're saying  mm hmm  what part of your cart was he at then  on the side of his of our cart  on the driver's by the driver's  yeah the driver's side yeah cos he was driving  kay okay and you say that you were behind the cart looking at your golf clubs  that's right  and you're saying that you could not hear what they were saying to each other  i wasn't paying attention   i wasn't paying attention pause about ten seconds   and so where was mark and steve at that time   at their cart  what were they doing at their cart  they were either at their clubs or they were sitting in their cart  they were right by their cart i know  so everybody was in a fairly small area right  yeah yeah  within hearing distance of one another  yeah yeah should yeah  well is there something about it that would affect  uh would affect someone's ability to hear do you think  i didn't pay any attention so i didn't hear anything so  i didn't hear anything  okay   and uh tell me again why you went back and saw her   why did you go back to where she was  to find out what was going on uh  going on about what  i dunno don't know   they they were talking laughing so   i went i went along too and that's where she was standing  which side of the cart was she on  on the driver's side  okay and so which side of the cart were you on   i went to the driver's side  so you went from around behind the back of your cart   around the back of her cart   around to the driver's side  mm hmm   that's right   that's right   you say she was already out of her cart at that point  that's right  you didn't drag her out  no  okay cough   and uh did you find out what was going on  no  why not   cos i basically i don't  maybe i changed the subject when i said okay one more hug and   i that's when i made the comment of her behind  mm hmm  and uh why why were you wanting to give her one more hug pause about five seconds   i'm not sure i just i just did  so you pointed out uhm the quality of her bum to  to your friends  mm hmm  i was just being nice  okay  did they react in any way to what you had to say  didn't make anything of it like they kind of laughed  did they find it funny   no they oh okay whatever   so now as far as you're concerned uhm uh that's about all that happened  that's right  well what point was it that you uhm could smell her and tell her that she had a nice perfume on  that's the time when i uh gave her the last hug when i complimented her behind  so when were you when did you tell her about her perfume  was that before or after you commented on her rear end   uh probably before yeah  two or three words   before cos the last comment i said was uh   uh was the compliment of her behind  mm hmm pause five seconds   and so what happened  what's the very next thing that happened  i want you to be really clear if you can recall after you were hugging her and made the comment what's the very next thing that happened  i went back to my clubs she got in her cart said goodbye and she was on her way out and she waved this way as she was leaving away as she was going up the hill   so when you went back to your cart did you walk around behind  her cart  yeah  back over to where your cart was  that's right  and w and you went to what part of your cart  to my clubs which is behind of our cart  to the back   so you went to the back  that's right  frank was still where  beside our cart  and he was still by the cart and mark and steve  were still by their cart  yeah  everybody had was in the same position saw you had gone over and hugged jane and so on  yeah cos it took like five ten seconds all  four or five words   right so they had all remained in sight   yeah  now the point as she was driving away you say they were all in the same position and you had moved back  yeah yeah pause about fifteen seconds   so i gather that uh while you were concentrating  well i'll ask you what is it possible that   jane ran over someone's foot while you were concentrating on your clubs as you described   no she wasn't going anywhere  so that that couldn't have happened while you were there  is that what you're saying  is that your evidence  well i i didn't see  i didn't pay no attention so i don't know  i don't know  you don't know whether it happened or not  that's right i i   okay well what opportu what opportunity   to my knowledge   to my knowledge  okay well is there some period of time that you weren't paying attention that it could've happened  is that why you're not sure  well i was close enough i would've heard something cos  the cart is heavy enough on the foot that you would've felt it  so did it or did jane  drive over someone's foot or didn't she  no pause ten seconds   i gather that uh since this incident has happened you've had the opportunity to talk to your golfing partners  def definitely   and to discuss that day and how things went  definitely   cos it is it is a serious charge   okay no further questions i have for you end of cross examination   mister griffin you're known as zeus is that right  yeah  and uh when did you move into the river   word house  it'd be it's a matter of a week or two after i  spent two words   and when was that then word june  fourteenth   an exact date   i can't give you that  i'm not too sure if it uh  just gimme give me a time frame please pause about fifteen seconds   august some time in august  of ninety-five  yeah  you were friends with rick before that  uhh  at that time you weren't it for doing a lot of drinking and and drugs is that right  uh drinking uh two or three words i'd have to say yes  whenever you could get your hands on it you'd do it  at

bit of it  i did too 
Canada	" well four or five words cos at one point in time i used to be able to get up at ten o'clock in the morning and drink a forty by myself and go to work   you'd get up and have a forty of booze for breakfast and go to work  yeah and then i'd go to work  just kin   a guy can't handle himself in alcohol  well then i don't you know rest of utterance  so you're telling me you can drink forty ounces and nothing  at one point in time yeah   kinda kind of knock the cap off and guzzle it down is that what you do  no now you're just being a smart ass  stop that  alright  wouldn't take anything more than two hours anyway   and when you you could drink forty ounces and then function at a job  well there wasn't there wasn't   much of a much work to be done anyway it wasn't much of a job  i mean we'd play around two words  picking garbage up well you gotta got to  think who'd have to be word to do that  a mechanic of some sort  well my father's a word   alright   i understand that you had smoked a joint joint  as well on uh september twenty-seventh  mm hmm   like early earlier in the day  you smoked a joint early in the day  yeah  early than what  what time  before you drank  well no it was after after i drank but it was in the afternoon when when we got rest of utterance  well in the afternoon you and uh mark uhm saw something or were involved in something that upset you is that right  yeah it was just after we left the two words  okay  and uhm you got sucker-punched  yes i did  and you didn't like that a bit i take it  uh no four or five words right underneath the chin   so i take it you didn't like it  well no  alright  utterance   well if you don't mind i'll ask the questions thank you   you phoned your mother  yes i did  and uh you were very emotional at that time  yes i was  told your mother you had a gun  yes i did  told your mother you were gonna going to   shoot the first person that you saw that got in your way  the first person that got in my face   why did you say that  well because well because you know me and five or six words at the time  five or six words you know sucker-punched and what have you  it kinda kind of to de   ugh to add add to the matter you know it wasn't a guy that sucker-punched me so i couldn't exactly hit her you know  it was a girl  okay  i would re i really would  like to you know but i do have some morals  okay  so you were upset at that so you told your mom that you had a gun and you were gonna going to shoot somebody  yep  and from from there you went down to the mall  yeah  and it's there that you smoked a joint  yeah  like in the garage well the parkade because   and from there you went back to the river place   yeah  and you were upset when you got home  i was yeah word cough   and was it still a little bit of word  that you were upset over   did you wanna want to go out and find uh  some trouble  no not really because uh i never like going out looking for trouble because trouble just has a way of finding me   kay okay well that night on september twenty-ninth you uh you have a knife on you  when you came back from the mall back to uh river place   yeah  so you got a knife from the house  yep  and you put gloves on  yep  surgical gloves  yep  and you weren't go you weren't looking for trouble   well like like the whole idea was to go out and uh rob somebody you know rest of utterance  that's not trouble to you  well i don't know at that time it wasn't trouble you know like   trouble is you know two or three words  when people are gonna going to get word  so when you told me that you don't go out lookin   looking for trouble it kinda kind of  finds you  yeah  uh  it follows me  pardon me  it follows me  you were followed  yeah it follows like at a great like four or five words you know they keep sending all my uh  paperwork from the penetentiary you know four or five words  you know it's more of a follower than a leader  that's where i've always been though   well that certainly helps your position doesn't it  well i wouldn't know   so is it your evidence then that when you uh put on was it one pair or two pairs of surgical gloves  it was two pairs per hand   you put the gloves on and and got your knife that uh that you thought you were gonna going to  perhaps go out for a robbery  well just go yeah just go rob somebody yeah  okay   picked the knife off the table did you  yeah  and you describe that as a rambo knife  a rambo-style knife   and you had kind of made a claim on that knife when  stephen brought them over to the house  yes i did  you had carried it before i take it  uhh yes i have  and you kind of all had a a a  usual knife  would that be fair for me to say  uhh well mark you it wasn't a emphasis on "" a""  usual knife it was kinda kind of knives  right  but i can't say that we really had any one specific because we could only only word  one day we'd have one the next day you'd have one you know and uh  rest of utterance   you liked that one  yeah cos it's big shiny and heavy  and sharp  well i can't say it was really all that sharp   why's that  well because of the on the  blade that's a saw you know the sharpest thing on the entire thing was the saw part on the back of the knife on the teeth  this uh knife had teeth on it then it wasn't a smooth edge   two or three words back side two or three words wires two or three words what have you  alright so both sides of the uh knife could be used as a  instrument of some sort then  do you follow my question  there's a sharp side and a  and a and a and a rigid side yeah  okay   and bart had a usual knife did he  well he had one that was usual you know like  two or three word final two or three word  earlier  right and that's uh   you're referring to it as a word knife  yeah  and that's the knife that you saw being put uh  in his uh in the leg there  do you know which which foot or which shoe  uhh no i don't  i mean i honestly i don't know   and do you know which knife rick bought that night  it'd be it was at the when the   two or three words   or it was a yellow yellow knife yeah nice and word   what about this one was there another one  yeah  utterance   utterance   does this knife have a this one or two words  does this knife have a sheath  i think it did  and when rick took that knife it was in the sheath   when rick took the knife yeah it had a sheath  and how does a sheath for a knife work  does that go on the on a belt somewhere  well it's just like a like a all sorts of knives are like that okay  it doesn't matter where you put the sheath  you can either wear it in your belt or if it's like your uh if it's like a wristband you can because it don't matter you know   word sometimes have a strap two or three words have a strap you can wrap around your leg  some of them you can wrap around you are spring-loaded and just pop open in your hand  how about this particular knife the the  knife that rick bought whether this is it or not the knife  rick bought  just just you know rest of utterance   how did he do it that night  it was inside his waistband  in the belt loop then  no in the waistband  alright  and how bout about yourself  uh mine was in the front in the waistband like right  right in front  where if i was to sit down it would be quite uncomfortable   you said bart had another knife  yeah  where did that other knife come from  it was also uh one that was brought over by can't remember who  stephen   stephen yeah  and describe that knife  it was it was either   i guess it was quite crystal and two or three words  on the table there like you know like there rest of utterance   like i don't know probably ten nine inches nine or ten inches  and the evidence is that you put that knife in his waistband  yeah  in the sheath  yeah pause about ten seconds   now you gave rick your knife at a short distance from the house  yeah   you hadn't come across anybody as of this time  no because i realized you know five or six words  i have gloves three or four words i don't need a weapon  i never needed a weapon   why did you take a knife in the first place  four or five words you know  i used to carry a knife around with me at all times   utterance   what'd rick do with the knife when you gave it to him  two or three words put it in his waistband as well  so now he had two and you don't have any  cough   certain you didn't give rick that knife  one or two words   yes i did   did rick grab it from you at the scene  nope   now when you get to the tracks you mention that you saw some workers and you uh saw what it turns out to be john   mm hmm   your evidence is that bart approached him first  yes clears throat   did he know what was going down at the time  uhh i forget he was really word on the whole robbery you know he was gonna going to  rob the guy take the guy's wallet you know   little did he know it was gonna going to  it was his life that was being taken  so you watched bart approach this  fella fellow   yeah   and you were i think your evidence is you were twenty yards away  i was in uh well rest of utterance   like from me to you or perhaps a little bit more  i'd have to say three or four words  about three quarters of the way down to the corner  alright  and your evidence is that you saw bart approach the fellow  right   could you hear bart saying anything to him  uhh that time rest of utterance   but i guess you were paying particular attention to what was going on  well yeah  yeah  you were very curious as to what was going on  very  right pause about fifteen seconds   you never seen bart pull the knife  not at that time rest of utterance   he had a knife to uh his throat and he told us that he stabbed him in the foot  right  and you never took your eyes you never took your eyes off him did you from the time you were word  in the ditch until the time you arrived  well i could see where i was to get up you know it wasn't exactly my area i wasn't gonna going to hang around  but you're telling us that when you arrived at uh  where bart and john were that john had already been stabbed in the foot  yeah  and y you didn't see this  no  no   did you see any blood  hmm   no i you you wouldn't normally see blood when four or five words in the shoes you know  personal experience   you've been stabbed in the foot before have you  well no it's just that uh you know i've stepped on a large uh spike you know word spike four or five words  and a large nail and you don't you don't see much   you don't see any blood through the top of the shoe  alright   and when you got there you say that bart was uh  around john's head area  yes  were they on the ground  uhh after after they uh  cut maybe they three or four words yes they were on the ground  when you arrived there were they on the ground  yes   and you watched bart push him down  yes  so he pushed him down before you arrived there  yes  once again you never saw the knife to the foot  didja did you   no i rest of utterance   so your evidence is then that bart had a knife  to the fella fellow and he stopped to tell you he stabbed him the foot  yeah pause about 15 seconds   and what is rick doing at this time  rick was pretty much right on top of john  like really right on top you know sort of  so like on the chest you mean  like in the chest area yeah "
Canada	 you and i have never met before a few words    no sir  how do you do   we have never met sir  all right  how old are you  i'm right now forty-five   in general terms in listening to your evidence and correct me if i'm wrong i i get the impression that uhm  you have a severe dislike for percy grey-tootoo   would that be fair  in the past i would i would uh say that but in the beginning i i adored the  fella fellow   'kay okay   well as of today your word    no i don't think so  i think he's got his problems but i don't dislike the man  you don't dislike him  no sir  okay  you you're not uhm relishing uhm  the idea of of saying  things that might stab in the heart of  no sir   nothing of the sort   nothing of the sort sir  you're not relishing it  no  you're just doing your duty by being here  no sir  i'm a very honest person  you're a very honest person  yes sir  and i suppose that hasn't changed at all  you've always been a honest person  yes sir  uhh before today and including today  well there's everybody has their day sir  ya  well i just want to be clear of what you're saying  you've just given yourself a character reference and you say you're a very honest person  has that always been so or is it a change   i don't understand the question sir   well have you always been honest  well i don't think so sir  i don't think any person has  okay  so when you say you're an honest person that means today you're an honest person  no sir   what does it mean  it means well i'm an honest person  i can say what i feel and what's honest   all right  and you've always done that  i i believe i have  all right  and can i get something of your uh education and training please  uh wh where did you do   your uh your elementary school   i was educated in montrea  montreal   i was educated in montreal  and uh  st. stephen's and uh havishill high school  okay  so you've graduated from grade twelve from   word   that's it  from havishill   that's it  and have you uh any advanced education beyond the grade   twelve   no no  i went to uhm ah business administration and i've had some uhm  several different courses in art  i got a degree in commercial art  you have degree in commercial art  yes sir  where's that  l'&eacute;cole des grands-arts  montreal  say again   l'&eacute;cole des grands-arts in montreal  and is that  when you say a degree is that a uh   word bachel bachelor  of fine arts degree  it's an art it's an art   no no no  it's   no it's just a commercial art degree course you know credit  what is the degree you've got  in commercial art  what's the degree  is it is there letters that go with the degree  no   it's nothing great  i'm not a doctor  so okay  so but how how long a course was that  oh i think it was uhm about a year or two i would say  year or two  it you're not sure if it was a year or two years  i'm not sure   ya   it's not imperative i don't think   just asking you  was it do you know if it was a year or two years  cos there's a difference   well let's say a year   okay so it was a year course   is that right  fine   i'm not asking you whether it's fine or not   ya  okay sorry   yes sir  yes  all right   and then after you took your commercial art course what did you do  i went to work as a marketing sales rep   mumbles   oh no sorry  excuse me  i went to work for the australian embassy in washington d c  i'm sorry about that  in what capacity was that  i was in the in the registry there  uh it's a class a-one vi visa  uh foreign official uh diplomat in uh washington d c working for the the australian government  a-one visa  so you were a diplomat maybe three words   well i was   no  i wasn't a diplomat  i was a foreign official being paid by the australian government in washington d c  a foreign official   'kay okay   and your capacity with the australian government was as a diplomat  no  as a registrar  a registrar   what does that involve  well like uh filing of and taking documents that are coming in from overseas and working as a well more of a clerk  okay  and how long did you work for the australian government  i was with them  well i got transferred to san francisco   uh i worked as a liaisons officer there and i was with them for  eww maybe four or five years  with the australian government  yes   and after that  i moved to vancouver  in what capacity  uhm i opened several of my own businesses  such as  uh restaurants a flower shop a landscaping company uhm  import a few words   okay   and you then eventually  is it after that you took a position with percy grey-tootoo  or redside word   uh no not right away  i went with an insurance company which a friend of mine was working for  he asked me to come on board with him as a sales rep and i worked with him for a year or so and it wasn't quite what i   to my liking   and uh then i went on with uhm percy grey-tootoo   and were you hired by percy uhh on behalf of  redside or  no that's another story sir  ya   i was hired by percy on behalf of redside  but redside didn't recognize it  and uhm uh i still have a dispute with redside but i'm not gonna going to word   far gone that they wouldn't pay the salary   so how long did you work for redside   well we were at redside uhh it wasn't too long because they were trying to oust him at that time  uh regardless of word how long did how long did you work at redside   oh it could have been three months   could have been three months  uh   well let's say two months so i can get your accuracy for  ya you   well let's word   say two months it would be right on  two months would be right on  ya  it's a long time ago sir   now what what uh what did you do with redside   uhm i helped percy pack up the business   what was what was what were  you hired to do   there was no uh job discrepancy or uh job description at that time  so what you actually did do is help close redside  down   yes sir  and uh as i understand it did redside go out of business at that point in time  they're still doing very well today sir  are they  ya  not as a chemical company mind you  well the chemical side of it   yes sir   they had redside chemicals did we not  as another aspect of managing redside   yes sir   yes sir  and you were working for redside chemicals  presumably  i presumably yes sir  and redside chemicals does not exist any longer  no sir  and when mr grey-tootoo left that was the  termination of redside chemical  that was the shut down  i believe so sir  is that not right   yes sir i believe so   and and when you say  did you suggest that that they wanted him out  they wanted to oust him out or something like that  what were you saying  yes i'd i believe they would  you got that from a source at redside   from the president  and and the source said  uhm they just couldn't do work anymore  there was uh there was no sales  'kay okay   there was nothing being produced and uh a lot of money being spent and uh   'kay okay   and that was information you obtained before you left redside  yes sir  okay  so from the two months you were working there you were told that  yes sir  and who was that president by the way  uhm i can get you his name uh  you don't know it  it doesn't strike me at this time no  okay  a very large gentleman though  large gentleman  yes  so you had a chat with him about   uh he had a chat with me sir  okay  and then you were invited to come to macaroon by  percy grey-tootoo   uhm actually i don't know  it's a combination of robert rester and percy grey-tootoo   okay  so you dealt with robert rester in in  vancouver  and uh here as well sir   uhm not here  in uhm edmonton sir  and in uh and he had a learjet and he was flying back and forth negotiating with uhm   with mr grey-tootoo  with you   and you too  well not in the beginning sir  well   it was mr grey-tootoo 's idea to bring me over here  and you obviously wanted to come here to work with him  uhm we had our doubts but yes uh we seemed to have great opportunity  did you want to come with him or not  uh yes sir at that time i did  you wanted to come work with percy grey-tootoo   yes sir because we believed in him  that's good  and uh even though the president had tried to discourage you  of redside   yes sir  i had i had no idea that   uh what their financial problems were but uh it didn't have anything to do with his personal personality   as far as i was concerned  right   okay  and before you worked for uh redside you had absolutely no involvement with the chemical  chemical companies   no sir   no sir  okay   and you say robert rester recruited you as well  in edmonton he made an offer to me yes  ya   and and where did he see you  uhm he didn't have a position  he thought uh i word that i should be in sales  where where did you have this meeting with mr rester   at uh his office uhm in edmonton  which office is that  he has redtag drilling in edmonton  okay  and so you've never been separate apart from uhh  grey-tootoo   uh no mr grey-tootoo was there  and i led him into a room now i think  mr grey-tootoo was in the same room  okay  and and he offered you a position there  yes   'kay okay   and what was your pay arrangement then  uh there was none at that point in time but uh when i left with mr grey-tootoo he said uh you will have a car and expenses  and uh when i left vancouver you'll get thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars a year and all the hoopla that goes with it  'kay okay   now that was told to you by rester   by mr grey-tootoo when i left redside   did you discuss with mr rester what your   financial arrangement would be   uh no i didn't i didn't   feel i had to because mr grey-tootoo was doing the  nego negotiating   so the answer is you didn't discuss it  no  okay   and so the the as a result of these discussions you came with mr grey-tootoo to set up redtag chemicals or to set up the chemical operation   is that correct  that's right  and you were at redside long enough to know whether or not redside was manufacturing any chemicals  uhm i'd seen stock there  no i wasn't there long enough to see if they'd been making any  money or not   did you see if they had the facilities to make chemicals at  redside   yes i did  and did they  not really sir no  not really  no  they had no facilities to manufacture   they had uh one little blending tank there and it couldn't have done anything sir  well what is a blending tank used for  uh if you're going to blend any quantity you'd want to have quantities over a thousand gallons so  right   so but if you have a blending tank what do they use it for  for blending material  for for what   is that the words   what do you use it for  what do you use it for water and uhm colour i guess 
Canada	 but did you see mr grey-tootoo blending any chemicals at redside   no sir  did you see him using the blender  no but i've seen one of his workers uh from time to time doing something for the chocolate side   for the  okay  so at that point in time did you realize then according to your evidence that percy grey-tootoo did not manufacture chemicals  well i hoped  i didn't know  i hoped he did  he was trying to hire me  is it just looking back that you now know that  is that what you're saying   no no  i believed he was manufacturing at that time  did you believe it at that time  yes i did  okay so before you left redside for macaroon  you believe that mr grey-tootoo did manufacture chemicals  yes sir  and now you're saying he didn't  is that what you're saying   no sir   i didn't know  i don't know  i'm saying i don't know sir  okay  so he may well have been manufacturing   he may well have been sir  okay  thank you for that  and uhm uh did the technology is that is it   percy grey-tootoo is that what redtag chemicals wanted  was his ability  yes sir  not yours  no sir  you didn't have any  no sir  all right  since then have you any  uhm i've adapted more knowledge now  let's put it that way  ya but you've had no formal knowledge in in  this area   no but i it  doesn't take much to formulate a product sir  it's all given to you   okay  so you do formulate prducts now   oh yes sir  okay  so you do have some expertise at this time  yes sir  all right  so when you came to macaroon with percy grey-tootoo  it was to set up a chemical manufacturer or distribution system for  redtag   yes sir  all right  and who made the arrangements as to the location  uhm percy grey-tootoo and hal ferrier   did you involve yourself with that part of it  no sir  i was going along having a look what they were deciding   they were located in the nova building redline  chemicals was word sir  mhh hmm  and uh and so far as the arrangements made with the integration space uh did you play any part in that  no sir  uhm were you at any time expected to be any part of the manufacture of uh of any of the chemicals or any of the uhh materials that were going to be sold  well  was that part of your job  uhm my job description in the beginning was uh marketing sales manager  yes  so you weren't at the beginning to be involved in any of the manufacturing  no sir  all right  and you knew nothing about it  no sir  isn't that right  that's right sir  no sir  okay  so that it was your understanding that mr grey-tootoo  would be the one in charge of that aspect of the operation  yes sir  all right  and when you came to macaroon and started operations was he in charge of that aspect of it  when he could be  yes  was he  yes sir  you didn't manufacture any chemicals in macaroon   oh yes i did sir  did you  yes sir  okay  when did you start manufacturing word   uh when he was incoherent and couldn't and he wanted me to blend some product for him and he didn't have uh people in production  all right  so you say that if  twenty-four word   you say that when he was incoherent which you're suggesting is that he would be drunk   yes sir  okay  and so when he was drunk you had no choice but to take over  uhh  is that what you're saying  no sir  what are you saying   he directed what to go in the tanks  all we need to know all we needed to know   is what  he instructed us what to put in there and we'd put it in there  so he did uh give some instructions about manufacture  oh ya  yes sir   we wouldn't uh be putting our own  we we don't know the formulas that he's supposed to have had or the ingredients that he's supposed to have had  we wouldn't know that  okay  so what you're telling me then is if i understand correctly is that he would give you the instruction as to what to put in to the batch maker to make a batch of chemicals   because without that you couldn't do it  yup  yes sir   yes   no sir  so that you agree with me that there was the manufacture of chemicals at the plant  yes sir  all right  and what chemicals were manufactured at the plant  a chemical that was already produced for mainland oilfield supply which was called drill splash which did not  work  okay   well i i i at the moment i didn't ask you about whether it worked or not  i asked you what chemicals were produced  you're asking me   i understand  what you're asking me is which word   all right  i need you to answer that  ya  drill splash   what   drill splash   drill splash   'kay okay   and that's what it's called  yes sir  all right  so that's one of the one of the   chemicals hat were manufactured  revex would be   yes and revex would be another sir  and that's the next thing i was going to ask you  revex   ya that would be in small quantities  and what was that for  uh same as drill splash but it's  uhm drill splash is half the strength of revex    half the strength  so it's a different formulation than drill splash   well you put more water in revex i suppose and then you have drill splash   ya  so it was a different formulation  yes sir  right  and did you on his instructions make that too  yes sir  so those are two chemical formulations that were made at the plant that you're aware of  yes sir   yes sir  and you when you got the formula from mr  grey-tootoo would he give it to you in writing  uh no sir  he'd uhm he'd stipulate what to put in there  in other words so it wasn't written down  no  well   no not really  all right  and so even when he was you say incoherent he was able to give you those instructions  well if the you know if the  formula doesn't turn out right and he gives the instructions   i mean it's his formula  he should know what he's he's saying so yes we did formulate under his instructions  all right  so  so just to back him up a little bit  you indicated that you used to do this mixing when he was incoherent  is that so  sir you have to understand that seventy-five percent of the time he was incoherent yes  all right  so the so your answer is that when he was incoherent you would have to do the mixing  well or the production people yes sir  okay   but even though he was incoherent he would be able to give you the formula to mix   i would like to know it was the right formula sir  i had to operate by his instructions  so the answer is that he was able to  yes   i hope so yes  yes and and you were able to comprehend what he gave you  it was trying at times  ya but you did you did comprehend  it and you did make the mixture  yes sir   yes sir  all right  and that's the product that was subsequently sold  did you sell drill splash for as  the sales manager   it was ruled   it was reworked and sold back to the people that it was supposed to have been sold to in the beginning yes sir  okay  did you as the sales manager sell this drill splash   no sir   did you arrange for the sales of the drill splash   no sir  who sold it  mr grey-tootoo made arrangements with the  mainland   okay  so mr grey-tootoo himself sold it  i'm sure he did  all right  and so what about the revex   that was just sort of stock that didn't go anywhere  'kay okay   none of it was sold in other words  well it's a good bit of chemicals  i'm not too sure of the quantities sir  'kay okay   did you arrange for the sale of any of it  uhm no  he woud do that himself  all right  so he sold that as well  yes sir  okay  now in addition to those to products did you see any other products manufactured at the chemical plant in macaroon in the time you worked there whether it be as redline> cryozine or  revothine   uh revothine they may have done some uhm  electr electric uh word electric  six hundred that they call word electric six hundred word   so the answer is   oh excuse me sir   excuse me  all right  i'll back up  certainly  the products  i went to korea of course  they were blended there and i would have seen that   ap application uh s g twenties and  greases and word   okay so there were other products manufactured in addition to drill splash and revex   and what let's let's   state one other  what was one other that was made   oh let's okay let's  go for fadi   let's call it fadi   what do you call it  fadi f d i f a d i    and and were you involved in the mixing and manufacture of fadi   yes sir  and uh did you uh did you uh  instruct as to how that was to be mixed  no sir  i was instructed by mr grey-tootoo   oh  so mr grey-tootoo told you the formulation that was necessary to manufacture fadi   he just told us what had to go into it  we put it in there  yes  what do you mean just   do you know how to make fadi today  uhm yes sir  you now know  yes sir  how would it be  is that because of formulations you took from him  no sir  i got it from uh shakco and impress and uhm other companies that he's gotten his formulas from  okay  so you make fadi now  one six five  this is our combination is five hundred  five uh  there's different combinations word   and do you show on your product that it's manufactured here  uh yes sir  uhm no i don't think we do sir  but you make the product   but we make the product here  it's you know  you do not show word   we're far far away - based   do you show as manufactured in far far away   yes sir   lots of it we do  yes sir  well is is manufactured in far far away   yes sir  including the fadi   yes sir  we buy the base product bring it here and manufacture it  all right  so that's  no problem  so the fadi was being manufactured at  redline chemicals cryozine and revothine   is that right  uh there's only one time it was formulated which was for  redline and that went over with uhm to  korea  ya   and instructions given by percy grey- tootoo  for the mixture  yes sir   yes sir  and are you using the identical mixture he used then  no sir   do you remember what he used  laugh i haven't got a  can't remember  i know it doesn't work  well i didn't ask you that  okay  you're anxious to say that stuff aren't you   well it's sitting in korea sir and i was just  there   all right   i asked you not if it worked or not   okay  mhh hmm  did i manufacture it  yes sir  i helped manufacture it yes   yes   okay  on his instructions  on his instructions  and was he incoherent when he instructed you on that   mhh i couldn't say sir  all right   general yes  generally yes  mhh hmm  okay   cos you said already okay he was drunk seventy-five percent of the time   and time after four o'clock  yes sir  okay  and you manufactured this stuff after four  we acted at four til until  one or two o'clock in the morning  all right  okay  so you've got now three products that were made under  percy grey-tootoo 's instructions and manufactured under his instructions  are there any others other than the fadi 
Canada	 so how was the body then  how was john   he was lying down  he was on his back  lying down on his back  yeah he was four or five words but i can't exactly word like  the person known as rick had like a two words    utterance   he had one hand on the top of his head and knife was to the throat  whose knife was to the throat  it was bart   where was bart then  he was at the head area   your evidence is they changed places  yes they did  and how was that  well you see when when a person's got ya you like when he's up and he's like his legs are broke it's not because you're not   you've got an edge because you've got a knife  it's your body you know like it's a matter of changing position  five or six words at three feet and you're already two or three words   and they did that again  yes  changed around pause about 15 seconds   and did you know what was going down at this time  no no you know well i rest of utterance  and did you you mentioned that   you you saw the robbery at that point   yeah  you saw uh  the pockets being emptied  who emptied the pockets  rick did rick and bart   you saw them take something out  yeah i didn't see exactly what it was but it turns out it was rest of utterance   but it was it was his front pocket  pause about 15 seconds   you gave a statement three or four words   yes i did  you read that statement today did you  uh no i read it yesterday about two and a half minutes untranscribed, speakers are too far away to hear, a statement is read  that certainly appears that you're two words  when you tell the police officers that the first thing you knew  of the robbery was when you were at jim thompson's house  word   but you just told us did you not that you watched the robbery  yeah  you lie to the police  nope  you lying now  actually no i'm not   it was just what i can remember over time it can't change what happened  but the robbery's a pretty crucial part wasn't it  like was that that's not just a little detail in your mind   well mind i don't look at it as crucial as some people might seem to reason  you know five or six words you know he robbed somebody he took a little money and he took a life  well it appeared to me that when you  pre-evidence when you talked with police officers and gave that statement you gave in the impression very clearly that you didn't know the robbery had taken place at the time that it was occurring  that's not the time   right so why didn't you tell them that pause about seven seconds   why   because i could  cos you thought you could get away with something  utterance   it wasn't because i thought it was because i could  i don't follow you sir   i could what  because i i'm not sure i can tell you why   two or three words right but cos four or five words   but what was in that statement okay it was true okay up until  like sure there are some parts where uh  like i didn't know if the if the  robbery was actually uh done right  okay at that point in time i'd been drinking by the case   i will tell you that  you know i had tried to quit on the side   that's right eh   just just just rest of utterance    no you three words   you got me worked up now  okay you're gonna going to  rest of utterance   thank you   and you know over time you know after being word  off that medication you know i like i said i   been word for almost a year now you know  your long term memory does start to come back  you do remember the fine little details  you know i mean   kay okay   so you're telling me your memory's better today than it was last march  yes because like you don't have these all  these chemicals running through your system  not even so much as tylenol for a headache  but you had been in cu when you gave the statement you had been in custody since the time of your arrest which was uh september thirtieth nineteen ninety-five the statement's march ninety-six  you'd been clean for some six months had you not  no i hadn't been not in there  alright  you were using in there were you  yes i was pause about 10 seconds   but you're not telling me you didn't know what you were doing because you used uh drugs or alcohol when you gave your statement are you  no i can't say that   so which version are you going with today just so i'm  understand about the robbery  i'm gonna going to stick to the statement the truth   and the statement says you didn't know about it until you got back   about the robbery  well i yes that's what i'm gonna going to  go with  that's exactly what i meant today  despite what you   one or two words   despite despite what i've said here you know   i word what are you gonna  going to do you know  you're gonna going to throw me in jail  i'm already in jail  i'm in my own little hell  you mean the worst thing we could do is throw you in jail for lying  well yeah you know  so you know   three or four words  because like being out they say like twelve hours a week you know that's a lie  but there's really no fear of that is there  you're you're already lost away  that's right  you got nothing to lose by lying  well i have a lot to lose i have a lot to lose  word   like rest of utterance interference on tape   you know i i i don't know about the others but i i word  interference on tape   because i found rest of utterance   and you're anxious to get back out there  i'm anxious to get back to my jail  well you're more anxious to get back out into stifled laugh society  no i want to get back to my jail  ah  it was a short cut  you're looking forward to getting released from jail  eventually   i understood your evidence is you didn't wanna   want to spend fifteen or twenty years in jail you wanted to get out you had a life you had a kid  right  right  but there's some things i just gotta got to  do before i get out   and unfortunately this is one of them  when you sigh left the uh  the scene where the body was  mm hmm  where did the word go  it was just in the dump with the green one where i went when i put it into the dumpster cos i saw the body drop  if i'd a i'd have known that there was  blood across the foot it wasn't rest of utterance   right  utterance   can i just stop you there for a moment   who put the knife in the dumpster   me pause about ten seconds   and i understand your evidence two or three words is that bart put or i'm sorry   rick put the knife in the in the   garbage can is that correct  utterance   what did you say  i said that bart had was  uh three or four words   okay   did you uhm where did he get that knife from  from me   because i i had taken the knife put them inside the lining of my jacket to where they could be seen  two or three words to somebody who just happened to be walking down the street or watching or whatever   so the knives you're saying that the knife that bart threw in the dumpster came from you  mm hmm  but who gave you that knife   i got i got all the knives from  folks you know like   you're not involved in this really are you at at the at the scene  no i i didn't go out i didn't kill nobody i didn't stab nobody  and you didn't   word   you did   i take responsibility for my actions you know i figure if people can do it i can do it for myself as well but   you you took their knives  yeah   why was that  because well i'm smart enough to know seven or eight words i wasn't given the chance to word  all of them  but i knew i knew where to put things  where they're not gonna going to be found  so it was your idea to put one knife in the   in the word   well i was gonna going to   i was all encouraged to put them all there but you know there's nothing going off in all different places   utterance pause about ten seconds   utterance pause about five seconds   so you would've had to take your trench coat off  yeah  well no i w w w  wouldn't have to at all actually because the lining you know  it's opening up the edge of the lining cut through the lining  you put three knives in there  yeah i did  you didn't take your trench coat off  not at that point in time  and when did you take your trench coat off  not until after after we got to uh joe's   you took the trench coat off at joe's   utterance   and there was one knife couple of garbage containers not the dumpster a bit smaller residential garbage container and was that knife thrown in there or put in there prior to going to joe's  yes  it was put in  thank god cos i don't word the garbage can  pardon me  i was word to my jacket   was the jacket still on  yeah two or three words   right  take it out of my jacket put it in the dumpster   garbage can   take your jacket off to fight   yeah   and who took the knife then interference on tape for about ten seconds   it wasn't me   who was it   let's see it wasn't me it wasn't bart  could be rick   rick did that  yeah  i mean it should be in that little word pile  pause about 7 seconds   you think so  i hope so   we'll just see end of tape   uhm you told us that you cheated at sometime in mid-october   you and smith sat down and sent out the uh letters that were required to six or seven words by virtue of the  two or three words   do i have that correct  i yeah that's that's around that uh date of that letter is when it came up  very quiet muttering   i agree  at that point obviously you must've had word  uhh  cos they had the address  i well obviously we we  sent out addresses  we sent out most of the subscription forms that we had  had one sub-development though  exactly yeah  so you would've had to develop a whole new one at that point  yeah  if for no other reason than because of that address  well that i i learned that i didn't handle all the forms right  i learned that i didn't have i dunno don't know two or three words for it  yeah okay   i didn't have  and then uhh with mister ramsey's form i'm like  i learned that i didn't have those  but for the ones that you were aware of obviously  loud noises drown out speaker for about seven seconds   yes i think i did   even at that point it wasn't it wasn't  that obvious the numbers yeah   cos we don't read them at all until the forms  two words   no and i don't know  no i mean i know that i had the form uhm and whether   whether i even looked or bothered to look whether there was a cheque   like my recollection was we had an extension   i wasn't i don't know if i was overly concerned  yeah but you told us that cough the proper way for you to two or three words was to collect a cheque and two words subscription  and again we know from the first word  that two or three words isn't the issue  even even by uh even by the time that you were sending out those letters  yeah  james dickson did not have a cheque but you have a form for him   so a fairly large chunk of change  yeah  so who deposited it  but   because that would clearly be improper and that would have to suggest that something was amiss   yes but as i say i don't i don't  think that i even bothered or or concerned myself at that time about cheques because of this uhh uh the extension that we had already  i mean i knew the extension was in place and i knew that we had to send out uh uh there was this requirement by the securities comission to send out letters   uhm uh my recollection is i just wasn't very concerned  robert wasn't the primary title on the  rest of utterance   yeah i guess if i was i mean obviously if i look   as i look at it now and uhm and i woulda   would have and if i woulda would have  seen uhh tom and uh james who took a subscription form without a cheque that in my mind i would have said no you've gotta got to have a cheque  but i obviously did not never s  never even concerned me  i mean uh because of this extension period pause about ten seconds   now it was around that time that uh thomas  two words   yes  and i understand that the reason of his leaving was that he had wanted a more important role in management of the u s funds
Canada	 cough when did you first study to become a psychiatrist doctor featherstone   uh psychiatrist  yes  uh nineteen ninety- uhm three  uh what month in nineteen ninety-three  june  so you've been a psychiatrist and qualified to practice as such in canada for slightly over two years  is that correct  yes  two and a quarter   a few words precise about it so  word what day in june did you become a psychiatrist  uh june thirtieth  june thirtieth  so uh you've been word practicing psychiatrist for two years two months  correct  correct  and uhm do you have any other teaching positions that you currently hold  uh no  the  uh well this is  ya uh kind of  i do do some teaching at tango shoe hospital at salsa  i used to do some teaching at the glengarry general hospital  what did you teach uh at the hospital in salsa   in the hospital  uh nursing students and uh the occasional family physician comes through  so you don't teach at the medical school in the department of psychiatry or in the medical college  not at tango shoe hospital salsa   i have done at the university of glengarry in uh  glengarry   what specifically did you teach there  uh medical skudent students psychiatry students nursing students  what did you teach them  uh psychiatry and forensic psychiatry  do you currently hold such a position  sorry  do you currently hold any teaching positions   no i do not  have you published any articles  uh none that are relevant to this area  but have you published any articles  way back when in nineteen eighty-eight on fertilization  so in terms of the psychiatrist you haven't  published any articles in the since you've uh been qualified as a psychiatrist  that's correct   cough and you currently uh work for a uh consulting company i gather  is that   that's correct  that's your own business  uh not mine but i work for it  okay so this is a you're one of the   psychiatrists employed at this company  that's correct  and uh the prime uhh part of your employment i guess as you've described already is to provide consulting services and expert testimony in various areas  is that what i understand that you're saying  you maybe two words   i wouldn't say my primary is to provide expert testimony  my primary area is to prevent uh to provide   forensic services in the assessment and treatment of uh individuals involved with certain criminal aspects of the justice system  uh certainly some of that work does entail being an expert witness uh but i wouldn't say the main focus was to be an expert witness  but you have been an expert witness some two hundred  sixty to two hundred and seventy times as i understand  uh that's correct  uhm the vast majority of those were done as i was   when i was with the university of glengarry in a teaching position  are you saying you testified in court two hundred sixty or two hundred and seventy times  is that what word   that's correct  and over what period of time have you done that  over the years nineteen ninety uh two roughly ninety-one ninety-two  somewhere in there uh word time  okay so some of that is prior to your becoming a qualified psychiatrist  that's correct  so how many times have you testified in court as a qualified psychiatrist  oh probably about half of that  a hundred and uh forty a hundred and thirty times something like that   approximately   so that's in the last uh two years two months  yes   and uh so that strikes me as as   taking up a fair bit of your time if you're testifying in court uh  that's almost every week  a few words   it does take it does take   a lot of time  that's correct  and uh i understood you say seventy or eighty percent of your work then relates to that either providing a consulting service and you're actually testifying in court   or or treating assessment and treating  well do you actually treat any  do you have any patients that you actually treat on an ongoing basis at this time  i i have a large caseload  and so you do that  you testify in court more than once a week on average and you provide consulting services  and that's sort of your practice  at the current time uh my cor court  time is actually reduced from what it was and i'm probably testifying maybe once every three or four weeks  come on  let's take this week for example  how many times have you been in court this week  it's been an exceptional week  i've been in court twice this week including today  and in terms of uhm your background material you said that you uhm have outlined in your report  a few words second page or first page of it i  think   uh the database   ya  the chart you looked at before you met with  mister rabbitfoot or in connection with the karen  report   that's outlined there   uhh i think so  yes  is there anything else that you did use or references that you did have that's not outlined in that database section  in regards to the written report itself  yup  uh other than my general knowledge and uh experience and uh uh i may have referred to a textbook uhm but i can't recall specifically  about it or not  okay  did you review the r t d file on mister rabbitfoot  i believe i did  okay  uhm is that referred to the item word    r c   r c m p royal canadian mounted police identification sheet criminal record  okay i'm talking about the r t d   sorry  i must i must   i'm sorry  the regional though-helping depot is what we here call the r t or the r t d   yes   they did you review their file  no i don't believe i did  and is there a reason you didn't do that  i couldn't i didn't have access to it  did you contact doctor ping to get access to that file  uhh no i i spoke with uh mister  bigman   and he told you that you did could  not have access to that file  i don't know if he told me i couldn't  we spoke and discussed the matter and i subsequently didn't see the file  uh i don't know if it was a matter of of   whether i couldn't or not  all i'm saying is that i didn't see it  i didn't have access to it  okay  so whether you could have had access or not you don't know  you chose not to follow up on that  i left it with mister bigman   okay  and he never at any time provided the r t d file  that's correct  uh would you think that something like that would be helpful in trying to assess a patient  it would be  uhm did you review any other medical file aside from the one dealing with suicide attempts  uhm uh uh i can't be sure  uhh there mi biz there might have been a a file a   a record on the the nasal surgery he had but i i'd stick that under tango shoe hospital word far far away  city hospital records i think   word   that's really not word i guess then  right   uhm so in terms of what ah diagnosis or what assessment  was made by psychiatrists who were treating mister rabbitfoot back in february uh when he was at the r t d you have no idea about that then  i wouldn't say i have no idea  certainly i did not look at the records or hear what the records  have to say   well what assessment did they make of him at that time then  well uhm uhm i haven't had access to the records  so i take it then it's it's fair to say you have no idea of what they assessed of him at that time  well i'm saying doctor tevees commented on uhh anti-social personality disorder and i can't remember if he commented on depression or not  will you tell me what the doctors or the psychiatrists who treated mister rabbitfoot in february of this year assessed him at according to what you know  sorry  two words question   can you tell the court what the psychiatrists at the regional though-helping depot r t d is what we call it so just so you know what we're talking about  here   ya ya   sure   what was their assessment of mister rabbitfoot  february of this year  other than what doctor tevees </@ cos i didn't have access to their rec ords i don't know   uhm well what did doctor tevees say about that  i think he commented on uhh anti-social personality disorder and i can't recall or not if he  can you show me in the report where he said that mister  rabbitfoot was diagnosed with having anti-social personality by   mumbles   i didn't see that myself but i sometimes i   miss things  i may have been mistaken  it may have word doctor  bondarychuk that i spoke to of course the a few words    you haven't had a lot of time to study those two reports have you  i've read them both through  just last night  correct  so you haven't had a lot of time to look through them think about them or  these particular reports  ya  they're fairly short uh but i honestly haven't memorized every word or every detail in in the two  reports   well you you show me  in their words ah what the the   diagnosis was in february of this year  sure   sure long pause while reading   uh uhh page three paragraphs three and some word  underneath that in actual fact that's incorrect  the word depr uh the word depression  word is referring to the meyertown   remand centre  however the regional though-helping depot uh specifies in regards to the diagnosis at that time which i presume is referring to r t d two or three words all the same paragraph uh uh comments on word abuse  disorder adjustment disorder with depressive mood an   anti - social personality disorder  okay  so there's no diagnosis of any major depression at that time  right  there's a diagnosis of a of ah  adjustment disorder with depressive mood mood   and i did state i wasn't sure whether a diagnosis of major depression had been made or not  okay  i'll just ask you again  based on what that report says you agree with me there's no diagnosis of major depression at that time  correct  because that would show up under axis one and major depression is a particular diagnosis with criminal two words  correct  and would you agree with me that uh psychiatrists who are actually dealing with a patient and treating him at that time are probably in a better position to uh make an assessment than someone who comes in several months after the fact  i would concur  what's kind of puzzling is that he remain on elavil  looks like a hundred and fifty milligrams which is a treatment for major depression   are you saying that's the only time that medication can be prescribed  at that sort of dose that would be the medical indication for prescribing such a medication  well you're not saying that that's the only reason  the only thing you've ever prescribed elavil for is major depression are you  i would prescribe it for uh chronic pain fibromyalgia  uhm usually the dosage is fifty to seventy-five sometimes a hundred milligrams  uh this would be an unusual dose to be used in anything but uh suspected major depression or for confirmed major depression  so i guess you agree with me that that is not the only thing you can prescribe that medication for would you   there are other things besides major depression that it's used for  certainly  so i think you said this morning you thought it would be unethical for a doctor to prescribe that medication for anything other than major depression  maybe i misunderstood you  i uh   well that's that's  not true then  you may have misunderstood me  i i believe i stated that i have serious concerns about a doctor prescribing that kind of medication to someone with a substance abuse problem who doesn't have major depression  that medication is also used to control symptoms like uh anxiety or aggressiveness or things of that sort is it not 
Canada	 uhh the answer would be no  uh there are other medications which are far superior to that  and as a general rule that medication is not used for anger  it's not used for anxiety  if i were to use something similar to that medication i might use imipramine and so would most other psychiatrists   are you saying that that medication does not have the effect of controlling those types of symptoms  it has a poor effect and if you're using it for that effect uh you probably maybe two words consider switching your agent   does it have the effect of controlling those symptoms doctor  uh by putting someone to sleep yes  so you're suggesting this particular medication for treatments   two or three words   actually elavil when it comes to the anti-depressants is  the most the word anti-depressant on the market and it used to be the gold standard when it first came out  i don't know when that was  nineteen fifty nineteen sixty  uh but most psychiatrists with recent training avoid elavil like the plague  so you disagree with the indication in the c p s possibly canadian pharmacists association that that medication can be  be prescribed for uh depressive patients suffering from marked agitation and tension to help reduce those two symptoms  that is anxiety or aggressiveness or agitation   right  well we're talking about their anxiety and agitation associated with ah major depression in which case i would concur you  would uh may treat the patient for the depression with this kind of medication and it is helpful with an associated anxiety and agitation  so you agree with me then that it can be prescribed to deal with those types of symptoms  is that correct  as a combined package where you have the depression  anxiety and the agitation altogether yes  i take it you are not in any position to comment on the uh  legitimacy of the assessment made by the psychiatrists in february nineteen ninety-five because you have not read the file about that  i believe that would be the case  and you have no reason then to quarrel with their assessment that there was no major depression at that time  i don't know if i'm saying that there was no reason  it seems there are a number of clinical indicators that suggest major depression was a possibility uh but i wasn't there and i haven't reviewed the records so i couldn't really say  but i i can hypothesize and speculate but i can't say definitively that yes he was depressed cos i saw that he was depressed  but everything you've seen would indicate that the indication was he was not depressed  he's had an adjustment disorder with depressive mood which is a different  if i could stand to correct yourself  i believe earlier on i'd stated uh that i think what happened was he developed a major depression in approximately november or early december which was subsequently treated with an anti-depressant for depression reason and uh this uh later resulted in partial resolution of the major depression which would present as an adjustment disorder with depressive mood  subsequent to further treatment uh the major depression resolved completely  can you show me medical records to support that hypothesis  i have indicated i don't have ac  haven't had access to the r t d   so that's purely your hypothesis on your part unsupported by any medical documentation  it would be a clinical uhh opinion  nevertheless whether we call it a hypothesis or opinion it's currently unsupported by any documentation is that correct  as are most of the diagnoses uh that uh psychiatrists do  that's correct  well why wouldn't you go and look at that r t d  file to see exactly what other psychiatrists had said about him and what other assessments had they done on him in the past  uh because i uh live in glengarry and it's a long way to far far away   so you appreciate that your distance and the time you had available did compromise to some extent some of the things you'd like to look at  in regards to the r t d records that's correct  okay   uhm so obviously they there  wasn't all the things done that you might have done in order to prepare your assessment in this case   uhm i think i that would be a valid point  did you read all the letters that were submitted to you  uh i did receive the letters  i did scan through the letters  i cannot say i read every single word but i certainly did scan the bulk of the uh the words in the uh letters that were submitted to me   did you did you not find those letters to be important indicators of mister rabbitfoot 's state of mind at the time they were written  uh could you be more specific  well do not letters  would they not be a good indicator of what the person was thinking or feeling at the time they were written  uh they can be yes   did you find anything in the letters which would help you  uh decide whether or not mister rabbitfoot understood his motivation for the attack upon maria   i can't i can't say i found any specific uh uhm items that clearly indicated he was fully cognizant of what he was doing and that i couldn't and that couldn't  have been uh a result of word being informed of subsequent to the event   as i said i didn't read every single word  there may be a phrase or two in there that i did uh fail to see  did you accept mister rabbitfoot 's claim to having global amnesia   accept it   mhh it's possible   uhh  i i realize it's possible  according to you do you accept him do you accept do you accept his word when he told that to you  well it's fa it's fairly   likely   uh put it that way  he did did consume uh a significant quan quantity  apparently a significant quantity of alcohol and apparently uh what appeared to have been halcion uhm so it it's   certainly fairly possible  uh am i absolutely certain one hundred percent no obviously not   well i'm asking you if you accept it  nobody can ever be certain of anything i guess  you have to decide whether you're going to accept it at face value or if you're going to be skeptical  i'm asking whether you accept it  yup   certainly  the other information i know is that in violent crimes approximately seventy percent of the perpetrators have uh a degree of amnesia related to the offense so amnesia during an offense uh over the duration of the offense is not unusual so i guess the answer is yes i would accept that as a reasonable explanation  was there anything in the letters that went against that  claim to global amnesia  uhm not not that i recall that  specifically specifically and conclusively would go against but then again as i just said i didn't read every single word  would you not think it would be important to go over those letters carefully to see whether or not there were things there that might contradict mister rab  rabbitfoot what mister rabbitfoot  said to you  i think the letters are important as offering a general theme  uh they're very voluminous and uh very boring as you   uh as you're probably aware  uh the theme seems to continue throughout the whole   whole letter uhm and uh certainly there's an item or two that uh would be of use to myself in arriving at a decision and  two or three words look at that   well was there anything in the letters that you found at all helpful in reaching your decision  the letters seem to indicate to me that he's a  manipl manipulative individual  uhm uh that he's uh getting a little desperate and is quite concerned about his position  uh that he has continued to be in involvement  involved in a relationship with uh caroline ticehouser   uh that there seems to be terms could be mispronunciation of 'tomes'  of endearment towards her  a little overdone  i think that's a manipulative aspect of his personality kicking in there  uhm he's persistent   so let's maybe two words   sorry go ahead  he's persistent over time as well  okay  uhm so essentially you found the letters boring  they're voluminous  you didn't have a whole lot of time so you didn't read them all  i did  i did  i did go through  i scanned them all but i did not read every word   did you find anything in the letters that indicated whether or not mister rabbitfoot had been sexually abused as a child   uhm i can't recall  well that's something you were making note of as being important i take it   that's correct  and in fact you consider that word to be a risk indicator that would go against him being high-risk because he  apparently was not sexually abused as a child  that's correct  and uh you asked mister rabbitfoot about that  i did  what did he say  he said he had not been sexually abused as a child  and you believed him   i have no evidence uhh to suggest otherwise  and so we know in the letters that he did state a number of mistruths so i don't know whether any one particular item can be judged as factual or not  they were all word stated by him  yes long pause, 40 seconds   ya i don't imagine you made any notes or kept track of letters so you wouldn't have i idea  any idea from looking at this letter whether it's one you sort of scanned or whether it's simply one that you know  you you read more carefully or not  ya i don't know how many letters he had  maybe fifty  there was ah like a whole pile wasn't there  ya   there's a whole pile  and you're right  they were pretty painful to have to read  yes they were   but in this uh particular uh case uhm you  if you could read this little portion here  certainly  just just read it to yourself  i don't word   oh okay long pause while reading   just that little   okay yes  did you see the part i've cut out   uh ya  it talked about his mother being raped and then he made me go down on him cos i was just a kid which is why i'm scared of two or three words   okay that would seem to indicate that there might have been some sexual abuse as a child  would you agree   well mister rabbitfoot has a little pattern in those letters of uh professing to be subjected to acts of sexual violence which apparently are not true such as being raped in prison and so i don't know if i can give ah this particular statement any more weight uh in terms of factual content than i would the statement i had been raped in prison  i'll i'll just ask my question again  sure   if you would answer my questions i'd sure appreciate that  you agree with me that that particular phrase would indicate  that he was sexually abused as a child  all that indicates is that he is stating he was sexually abused as a child   he stated to you one time he wasn't sexually abused as a child  in this letter he's stating he is sexually abused as  a child  correct   correct  you have no better knowledge than me as to which one of those is true do you   exactly   and what you did point out that there were other allegations of sexual abuse in these letters referring to what happened to him at the institution  correct  mister rabbitfoot himself admitted to you that those were false  correct  he uh you never got into discussing this particular aspect of the letters because i take it you hadn't noticed that or read that before just now  correct  or if i had read it i have forgotten  well you certainly didn't take it up with him and say what about this part here   no i did not  i'd find it interesting to know whether that's true or not  it would be interesting to know whether it was true  or not   and if it is true then certainly one of the risk factors you say aren't present in fact is present in this case 
Canada	 okay clears throat   too quiet to transcribe   okay   and clears throat well tape disturbance   in front of you is exhibit d forty-one loud sigh  which is a letter dated august twelfth   yes it looks right   okay   clears throat   and uh at this point and time had you three or four words of august twelfth uh the exhibit d thirty-eight appears to be have been signed and and   a formal agreement been entered into   by this point in time august twelfth   no i did not   kay okay   no i did not   w you clears throat you  heard the evidence of the national bank of canada that  the there was a meeting between yourselves and one of either mister big or mister small in july  do you recall that  yes i do  and do you recall when that was  it was later in the month  o of july  yes it was right at the end of the month   and who was it with  ah it was with both mister big and mister small word   okay   in their offices  yes  okay   loud breath and did they provide you with any document maybe 'documents', pronounced 'documenth' at that time  ah no they did not  kay okay   clears throat and the they   answered your questions that you you  addressed to them at that time  yes they did  okay  and now would you address exhibit d forty-one in terms of  the time  it coincided with my trip to ah strawberry fields   i guess you could say that what we were attempting to do was to you know glean some comfort one or two words something that we wanted three or four words   and uh three or four words information that  we we' d got there were certain things that caused uh some concern  and are those things uh addressed in in uh the letter of august twelfth   certainly uh one of the things exactly   things that three or four words  acquisitions were still three or four words   mister hubbub was attempting in his word  letter of august twelfth was to was to  word all these things trying to  include some conditional comfort for us which was word  to uh uh certain issues particularly three or four words excuse three or four words  kay okay   anything else come to light clears throat in regard to the performance of the company   the other thing particularly   we we had a concern   i guess not particular for   beyond them beyond the word uh dispute we had some concern with respect to uh to  the company's reliability  we looked at the financial statements and we looked at the  assets   they they certainly had a one or two words supply of word non-performing assets and word some real estate that wasn't useful  two words reliability to the company  uh they had a capital structure which was uh not  which was not appropriate for for  the the way the company operated  in fact i was really surprised  the uh banking nature word they arrived at as a result of three or four words   and i wasn't helpful word the financial structure the accounting structure   clears throat   so the point is the letter uh word    this is exhibit uh d forty-one  yes  kay okay   i wanted to put it at ease with respect to  the uh the strawberry fields situation that it could be resolved and it was resolvable   and uh in addition he made another uh three or four words he added another condition in which he could  two or three words to do the deal and that was that he wanted to two or three words   and  did that word had been discussed earlier  no this was the first time three or four words  kay okay   now clears throat there is uh uh   jekyll maintained his interest in the project and there is   exhibit uh d thirty-nine  that's right  and by the they this time  th th this time the time of exhibit d thirty-nine had you met with the national bank of canada again  uh i met with them two words   about this time  uh we we had uh by the time this letter was written we had learned a good deal more about the company  we had gleaned some comfort  the problem i was still having was that  was that mister jolly mister smiley   three or four words they they   wanted it to to go quickly  uh i was concerned with our ability to perform in a timely manner the way they wanted us to uh  and in fact i was i was  determined to that word all  word in order to alleviate that in order to help us with that situation ah we introduced investments-r-us   two or three words invest or could invest in the company for professional first year   and we were also told that a word application   could could help us financially in   in recapitalising this uh company  had it not been for those two things rest of utterance  kay okay sigh   did you have any dealings with uh investments-r-us or  did you work at all in regards to the investments-r-us situation  prior to or at the time of that uh document which is exhibit uh d thirty  - nine  this question over my visit uh to   uh to word at that time needs to be  uh i met with the principals with two of the principals from  investments-r-us uh mister noddy and mister shrek   who uh who introduced me to word  and all sorts of three or four words  investment  and we talked about their conditional investment in the company  uh the company two or three words   one thing uh  did they have any concerns  their biggest concern was that uh certainly from the standpoint of the of the type of investment they saw the potential   they all saw the potential for the tremendous opportunity in this company  uh given the right capital structure and given the right  being situated in the right market the company could do very  well  uh the type of investment they had was not very  successful so their major concern was to three or four words   that is the type of investment  investments-r-us had  actually three or four words the investment investments-r-us had was a third shares  of of uh nuclear industries three or four words which were which were not at all  three or four words and not three or four words   okay  and did you were you able to uh  deal with those concerns  uh i'm sorry deal with those concerns of investments-r-us  yes we were  and did you deal with them and alleviate them before  the offer of august eighteenth   it was right about the same time  we we canned the structure of  two or three words to work for uh for  investments-r-us two or three words  public company as well  okay  and who were you dealing with in that regard  i was dealing with well in the beginning i was dealing with five or six words   with with uh peewee two or three words   ultimately we uh we dealt with uh   magic beans and and and at one stage we  simply turned them over to uh mister humpty to deal with uh  mister humpty   mister humpty actually  mister humpty to uh be the director  word uh another director two or three words   two or three words he secured his  lawyer   and uh he he performed uh   you know paperwork with with uh  four or five words   did you also deal with the neverland stock exchange  absolutely  one of the first things we did was we applied   we wa we wanted to find out what the stock exchange's attitude would be towards us word  involvement word investments-r-us  opportunity was gonna going to complicate the transaction and whether or not we could apply   and did you get that proof  yes we did  clears throat word  showing you document dated october fourth nineteen eighty-nine from the neverland stock exchange directed to yourself and  word processing   word   yes  and and do you  two or three words   yes  did you receive that document  i did  and did that deal with the issues that you've just described  yes it does  and did that contain conditional rules for the issuance of the the warrant and the arrangement that you have described to the court  yes it does  sentence   sentence   clears throat pause about 20 sec   document d thirty-nine the letter of august  eighth nineteen uh eighty-nine did that did that letter get accepted by the parties  this letter was accepted  it was accepted by an eighth party  uh   okay  it was it was word  clear how many shareholders there was  two or three words industries but uh   once we had reviewed the documents we were comfortable with the fact that there was only really one common shareholder and that was mister humpty   not not withstanding the eighth which suggests that there are two but there was only one common shareholder in reality and that was mister humpty   yes   that's right  okay  and cough and uh   was the was the money advanced in the fashion described uh in this document  no it was not  it's uh   can you describe how it was advanced and when  two or three words let's see  uh   this document wasn't offered uh directly  two or three words processing to  john humpty   cough   two or three words processing was not producing the word required by two or three words three hundred thousand dollars uh  and word had received shareholder approval  what we needed to word was some form of interim financing  this is the bridge financing that we heard   we have heard of in these proceedings  it certainly included the bridge financing  okay   carry on  and uh so what we did on an interim basis was  effectively lend john humpty three hundred thousand dollars because and issued in cash  he wanted cash  and uh uh name did not two words in a position to three or four words  and advance the cash on that basis   and cashmore adva   cashmore capital corporation advanced that money  that's right  and clears throat and and  we understand that cashmore capital corporation acquired that money from   two hundred and fifty thousand of that was acquired from  bling corporation end of utterance   kay okay   and uh did that deal to that is evidenced by august  eighth uh get uh papered if you will in terms of a   a share purchase agreement   not this exactly  well certainly word deal with uh  i would say four or five words   this deal i spoke of that we uh   sentence   uh let me show you lawyer shows and discusses something with an extra-corpus speaker for about 45 seconds   word show you the document that's d twenty-six   three or four words that is a share purchase agreement speaker a is too far away from microphone to record rest of this questioning for 15 seconds   is that your document that was produced to  four or five words   yes it is  and was that back in word   yes it was  clears throat   now now we're in september   of of nineteen eighty-nine and can you carry on with uh the transaction at this point in time  what what do you doing  we've got you working with neverland stock exchange in relation to the investments-r-us transaction  did you you deal actually with  investments-r-us yourself  yes sir i did  and who did you deal with there  uh primarily with mister name   okay clears throat   and uhm  yeah we filed word this uh document three or four words in the middle of september we moved forward to to to peak the immediate transaction two or three words the process  i must say that at the time we uh we  didn't expect it to take much time  we expected to four or five words we could process it within not much time at all  four or five words working on it  four or five words it needed a lot of work on the  uh   and what work was that two words  well he's he had to first of all he had he had uh stock exchange approval  over transactions  uh the conditional approval i should say over transactions four or five words the uh   our shareholder approval so that so that  all of the documents that we produce with respect to the acquisition had to be vetted first by the neverland stock  exchange  we should send them uh uh material with respect  to the uh to the officers and directors of the   c company   okay   and get and we had to perform an independent business valuation of the of the   uh company four or five words company  and uh uhm we had to respond to their deficiencies if you will in looking back three or four words    and by deficiencies you're just   that's a term of art uh with the public company dealing with this stock exchange or security commission is that right  yeah that's right basically   in making that they do ask for a bunch of things which we provide them with and word we're asking for a bunch more things  yup   several words word  several words   okay   i i i put in front of you a document that's exhibit d twenty-seven in these proceedings  do you see that  yes i do  a and can you advise us again in terms of the timeline that we're attempting to follow  clears throat what that represents and when it went out and   yes i can very faint   what what this is this is a  uh this is a proxy information circular   and uh this document can be sent  to all the shareholders the shareholders   all the shareholders of of  the public company  and it has to disclose the information on the on the transaction  it was finally approved in the form that was sent out by october the tenth nineteen eighty-nine   and prescribed a new they prescribed a new three or four words   word opportunity after that day was to  three or four words   so it was over on october the eleventh or the  tenth   on october the tenth three or four words  now by this point in time october the tenth  nineteen eighty-nine uh were you aware of the potential of  one or two words polluted one or two words  in terms of the actual word action involved  one or two words   yes i was  and how were you aware of that   well as i stated earlier in  in the beginning we had some concerns about this whole  transaction taking place  word word  an application two or three words  all the documents to be reviewed  uh that application then was turned down   uh mister blobby three or four words  after that  we should word take another run at  that and and two or three words  to overcome uh the conditions that needed to be satisfied  to present three or four words to find the things uh that we rest of utterance 
Canada	 yeah  is that a fair summary  very   so it's not quite accurate to say that  two or three words was fired   well i dunno don't know i had  to hand him off two or three words quite frankly  that that may well be so mister  roberts but can you agree with me there was a certain animosity between the organization and mister jones   yeah i guess tom tom was not happy with that   i don't agree with two or three words   and the number of decisions that came about rest of utterance   uhh   interruption from another speaker   utterance   well i i don't think it was unreasonable  tom tom advised people that he was uh not no longer gonna  going to be part of the organization and obviously people who   bought may have bought cos tom was  three words so if they rescinded i that's  not unreasonable   i think it i think it was a couple of days pause about 10 seconds   now i believe you indicated uhm two words  before the jury that you got the replies two or three words in a pretty old fashioned way paper shuffling and noises block rest of utterance   well we didn't think there would be as many interested  alright and at that point you testified that the  rest of utterance   thank you my lord   now doctor hubbard first of all i'd just like to uh be clear on uh what facts uh it is that you were relying on for the evidence that you word this morning when you described the various diagnoses of uh homer simpson   was i am i correct that you said that you were relying on your own interviews with him prior   it was he that gave you his background   that's correct  was there any other material that you usually record when you're doing your diagnostic evaluation   uhm there was uhm a single uhm notion that the social workers' report suggested that there was a fear of uhm   four or five words   that was something that he had told the the  social workers  social workers   and was there anything else that basically word  your one or two words   there wasn't any uh there wasn't really anything else   now i gather that uh from what you've told us that this was indeed the first time that you saw him it was maybe because   rest of utterance   that's correct  and it wasn't until the third time that you met with him that there was this aspect of a sort of forensic analysis uhm relevant to two words   that's right  and so that was uh how much time did you spend with him other than that  the interviews went an hour half an hour and one hour only  two or three words would have been rest of utterance   but i gather that just from what you've told us that it doesn't look like you've been asked for any other historical background information that you've been telling us about  that's right  and uh you were telling us that what wasn't  wasn't your evidence implying that that  one of the things you did was to rule out the ca like the idea of  word uhm with respect to the two words  i didn't necessarily say that i didn't rule that out  would it have been of interest that you were making that statement and determination of hypotheses two or three words   uhm the the thing is can i say that uh you've gotta got to be   two words scientific and i think that uh that's always one of the ways frankly that i use to to uh to   see and uh to collect information as much as possible  so three or four words you might be able to tell me your own observations about homer simpson 's days gone by and that you might have gotten how his history from his parents about  about word   i i gather that this word  phobia though is that with this particular phobia blood-injection-injury uhm phobia it usually i  it comes at a usual time  yes  so a prior history uh would be associated rest of utterance   utterance   and uh i gather as well that this uh this  this particular phobia is uh quite highly familial   what does that mean  that means it's akin to uh families  at this point there's no other sheer evidence that i know of anyway that one or two words families  see the reality of of all phobias is that this is highly learned behaviour   typically learned uhm via uhm from   the mother  now this this is cos of increased exposure to to three words  growing up   it can usually be learned from from  fathers as well it depends who you're exposed to   phobias as a rule are learned behaviours and can be learned from people like word who associate them with  suffering   now four or five words in that it is a  fatal response is loss of of uhm blood pressure is a typical response and that is the part that two or three words   and i gather if you had been able to take histories  of uhm some of the family members you might have been able to place out   whether or not uhh what those diagnoses   word   now how can this uh get you to tell us  i think what i'd ask you to do if you don't mind doctor hubbard  is to just tell us a bit of a bit more about amnesia  i would like the kinds of amnesia and just a word or two   thank you  uhm there are a significant uh word  of diagnoses that i two or three words and these two'll become evident amnesia  these types are all short-term  they there's global amnesia general amnesia and short-term amnesia  one time  okay  one one time localized amnesia then  two or three words   two or three words localized amnesia is that it tends to look like rest of utterance   and is it correct with localized amnesia that what you find  is is maybe some traumatic event has occurred like a person's been in a car accident or something like that   and and they lose a couple of hours or even a couple of days around the event  yes  and that that's what you  thought is that  uhm it i don't think  three or four words to the person  uhm memory actually is divided into the two the two aspects of memory  there's the active registration and the word  recall  uh registration is that part of the memory where memory is put   into into uh that part of the brain where it's retained  short-term memory is three or four words   the second part of memory is the two words is recall  uhh recall is two or three words active  and uhh when memory is going to do a long rest of utterance  so uh with localized amnesia you're saying that the memory  forms but the recall is what's affected  i don't think that we know that  two or three words  three or four words   two or three words   the problem is that if if the registration is wasn't two or three words then you weren't able to put it into memory then basically there wouldn't be anything to recall  uhm or perhaps there's because a disturbance is three or four words or whatever else  i don't think they you know  i sure don't uh i sure don't understand  now i gather that from when i what i   saw one who suffers uh localized amnesia that it may be the case   that that they know everything about that day that   word   possibly loud cough four or five words of course you know  but uh but  and what are the other possibilities i mean how   well how how complicated is it to get the memories back after you suffer local   localized amnesia  uhm   cos it's not   if it's not coming back at all how does two or three words   it's very uhm i think there for example would be  two or three words hit it with where a person has had uhm localized amnesia over a period of time uhm when he was drunk  if you start from that once uhm once  the trauma of an episode is over it's gone  it'll come back once the rest of utterance   can it can it can it come back within a couple of hours  it can  it then can it be said that that would be unusual could be 'uh usual'   uhm i it would  yes  uh and now is that what we're talking about with respect to homer simpson   sort of three or four words would it be an account of localized amnesia by your own standards   localized amnesia as i said can take place as far as ten uhm  three or four words and i would say that the top  layer indicates that the confusional description in the  interference on tape covers rest of utterance   and is there any aspect to to of  the ones described to you of those incidents that doesn't make sense and is there a three or four words   uhm  is there something about the word or the  two words that's unusual   i'm i'm not i don't think there's anything particularly useful about that  i'd say the classic uhm word of amnesia could take you know three or four uhm up to twelve months and even his loss has been external so it is variable  now i gather that what you're telling us that amnesia is  is a feature of when you're talking about four or five words  okay  uhh how does how does amnesia relate to behaviour at the at that time  well uhm i g i i i need   to picture my two or three words for instance  uhm indicates a blackout an alcoholic blackout  the the problem uhm with alcohol blackouts is that the person is intoxicated and is not able to lay down memories  they can still be functioning they can still be doing some things other people can word   so all kinds of people experience alcoholic blackouts  and and absolutely no recall of the   of the event  but their behaviour though will try to like   perhaps people who uhm are i dunno don't know maybe not aware of what was happening you know view it  as as as rest of utterance  but i i think that the direction that this is going is is is i think it's important for you to see is that the specific things the word the agility the panic attack the word attack and that is the more important thing three words the rest of it i think is  and i i i   we can get into that doctor uh hubbard but i  three or four words answer my question of amnesia  i mean is it not correct that that  the fact that someone doesn't remember what they they've  done doesn't mean that they won't two or three words   okay yes yes   so then later on word there's no way four or five words   can't you can't   two or three words   the fact that they no longer recall the  the time  something's telling me that two or three words  don't know anything about the level of functioning  no they don't pause about 10 seconds   now going through the uhh the  incidents that you rely on and i gather that loud throat clearing, shuffling papers covers about 8 seconds and uhm and they do describe too i gather uhh a sort of amnesia associated with that   the function including brain word    were you able to pick out a time  from what you had rest of utterance   it was uh he   i don't i don't recall what happened  you refer in your uh i was just referring to  your word of your report you said  amnesia amnesia can take hmm a break  i was just wondering if you know of a specific time point when word stops  it says the next two hours  so it it starts at uh  well i didn't i didn't uh i heard uh the people were uh going to be around  that wasn't something you had seen to uhm  i didn't no   and then uh the one other activity that you uh rely on is  three words where only one is obviously   yeah and and the reason  all we did is also was just  two or three words to express amnesia  at that point in time i i don't recall  i think that he just described sort of the intrusion up to the event uhm which one or two words a thirty to forty-five minute episode of amnesia two or three words  from the time of the event to the time of being in the hospital after being treated  okay  a and uh can you tell us uh doctor hubbard uhm did you inquire with him for more   for any more details about this particular incident than what he told  i didn't   i uh  i was relying on one or two words that uh  so i gather that what he told you was that uh he took  his foot up out of his boot and the skin had been hanging from his foot  on the foot yes   and then he put his foot back in his boot  uh did you inquire about where his sock was  i didn't  did it strike you at the time  did it did it just make sense to you  no i   two or three words   two or three words   cos he told me there was skin hanging from the foot i  assumed that the sock word   i see   but you didn't ask him about that   utterance   no i didn't think it was necessary   and uh i gather that uh you didn't have any kind of access to hospital records on that night   i i didn't  so i it's correct is it not that when three or four words to the hospital that they would've known about his two or three words   that's right   that was three or four words   and uhm i gather the other incident was uh  the other incident was rest of utterance  that's correct yeah  uhm and uh here i see i gather you described  a word amnesia three  yes   any comment on on on on what kind of amnesia that is that two words   well that was the name for an episode where the same type of response where there was an injury there was a time of  uhm of impaired memory impaired judgement 
Canada	 so difficult to to really comment  then you and i were talking about uhm the uh  the proposed closure of the various schools and  and the position  mm hmm   uhm we talked about uhm not relocating or identifying a specific location but rather an word   that that we think would be most beneficial for the placement of our school  mm hmm   right  and i was thinking how do we uhm process that with uhm all the reasons why we would like to keep the &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re system open  cos we did a lot of background work on that uh last year   when the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res were uhm somewhat vulnerable  before  so i'm just curious to know uh if if  all of that information is gonna going to   be compiled into one document that will go to the l s b school board  uh huh   uh huh uh huh   well uh what we have done so far is the list   y you you remember the list that we made of all the characteristics of the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res   mm hmm  well that list was handed in by our school and by  beakervale and uhm i believe by larkley as well  many of the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res were there handed in that that tuesday night when we all went to beakervale  high school and gave some of our ideas to the board about what we would like to see for that and at the beginning of the race  mm hmm   that's where we're letting them know exactly what kind of schools we want to have  that can also be included in just uh what we wanted to do at that point was to have all the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res uh and &eacute;coles secondaire handed in to the board to show the board that we all want to keep this kind of school  we want all want these characteristics to remain and that that is something   that that is really we're not here to debate about  we just wanted to know that these schools that are vulnerable where they'll be placed  mm hmm  so that's already gone in in this discussion but it can also be added to whatever we come up with about our particular school and sit in with that as well  that would probably be a fine idea  okay  okay  just because i feel that uhm uh if one is to uh know the position paper uhm based on an uhm  the importance of keeping the school open uhm one has to include the uniqueness uhm of of uh  you know  mm hmm   of this school   uhm so you didn't identify specific locations but you did identify geographic areas that you felt uhm  would be appropriate and that was based on  the central trying to choose a location that was most central to the entire uhm l s b area  mm hmm   mm hmm   yeah   mm hmm   and well i guess well our our  location   well particularily to to the people we serve   okay   yeah     because because what we were looking at was something north of the thirty between  spruce and fatima or source excuse me spruce  and churchill   mm hmm   mm hmm  and a fatima building  it would be one of the things that we uh we   had with that we would like to h retain   our name so it would also be helpful if we were in  fatima   mm hmm   we're starting to get a form in the craft and a name it would be nice to be able to continue with that   oh gosh imagine if we were able to keep that  it's true   mm hmm   it's true   mm hmm   there's a lot of them   mm   it's all part  really when we sat down and looked at the map it all became very clear that for us for our clientele we can't go too far away from them  we've we're already too far away  mm hmm mm hmm  so uhm so this is not for changing it closer  what is the uhm the location that bayside serves  do you know  it's closer i it's   i believe it's from s really around our school boundary over towards the  missiongate area  mm hmm   i believe it goes as far in in   towards that area  okay   i don't know the exact location but uhm on the map uhm  elizabeth will be able to to show you  but it's really from our school over  and they share with the p s b g m also school board   mm hmm  okay  yeah  it's a it's a rental and they  they share  there is about two hundred students at bayside   l s b students  mm hmm   it would be a long hike for them though to move   to to go from let's say the  missiongate area to somewhere in between spruce and  aberman   would it not  that would be the farthest that people would have to go i believe  i was thinking a lot of them actually'd   actually would be somewhat in the area of our school  hm   you know  a little farther a little farther away from that  yeah   if uh if they're looking at an l s b school uhm and and they're not going to rent the facilities  we looked at the map and what was available  it's still a long way for them but it's  by bus it's not it's not that far  i mean it's it's it's d   just down fatima boulevard  mm mmm   you know   it's a straight straight route not too bad but uhm  there isn't too much else otherwise   mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  uhm so i don't know if that's going to happen  if there's going to be a joining of the of the  two schools but uh if if that is the case it would bring our population up to the point where we would need a fairly large school to to handle our  or if they were allowed to maintain where they were  would that would   moving our school it's difficult to say how much additional clientele one would get by moving our school to a more central location  mm hmm   and we wouldn't know for a couple years would we because uhm  we'd have to settle and let the community get to know us and   find out if there's a market for our kind of school  mm hmm   but uhm i think   i think with the public if all the schools are abominable then everyone will have to we have to wait   for the dust to settle everywhere because all all  these changes will take place and then you'll have to get used to it's like moving into a new community almost and learning  which schools are uhm belong to which school board and and and  the locations in all of the schools so it would almost feel you're like moving into a new community   that's right   that's right   oh yes    and and there are complicating factors too in that the l s b may move into early immersion  th it's possible  mm hmm   and if they do well then that's uh competition for the type of school that we have   i still would rather send my daughter to an  &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re because i think it's a different experience and i think that she'll have more the type of experience  that that he was mentioning  mm hmm  you know  that's right  and and the closer you can get to that without the child becoming stressed which  i i don't see any any  problem with that so far with my daughter  that's right   mm hmm  uhm the better  mm hmm  but a lot of people when you're when you're sending your child into school you might say well  they've got early immersion so that's what i'll go for  mm hmm  so that'll be a competition for our school so it's  so that'll be a factor if that comes in in the next few years and i had a feeling don't have anything to base it on at all  but it's just gut and i think that people are gonna  going to be moving towards early immersion in the l s b  yeah well it certainly is it looks like it's  a growing trend in the uh in the p s b g m system  uhm and and uhm in fact there are a lot of schools that are bilingual schools and and  many children choose to go to either the english classes or the french classes but there are bilingual schools within the p s b g m  mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm   so you're seeing this more and more  i think it's almost a a cheating way of getting around the bilingual program uhm because uhm as was s suggested you don't really learn uh a true y you're  learning an academic language as opposed to learning a functional language  <mm hmm   right right  and uh that's really unfortunate you know because uhm uh  y you grew up in ontario i think   right   mm hmm mm hmm   so you've had the same experience i had where i learned a very academic french in school and went out into my community which was a french community and tried to apply what i had learned in school and was laughed at there  mm hmm   mm hmm   laugh   laugh   uh it was very frustrating and uh so what i literally did was i just entrenched myself in my social life in in in   french uhm to pick up the real french or what i considered to be the real french there the functional french  and then i used that to my advantage uhm and  when uh when i was being tested uh  for for language uhm in school  mm hmm   mm hmm  and so i can remember w when  it came time for examinations we had to uh write on index cards  three topics uh that we would like to talk about  mm hmm  and uh because i did so much horseback riding   in uhm uh in the area i had all the terminology down pat laugh in french   laugh   so uh i knew that that   was somewhat of a unique topic and that by the time i got in to meet the evaluator he may have already spoken to other students fifteen or twenty times on sums subjects such as hockey or uhm baseball uhm or perhaps uhm dance or or or  piano lessons or something like that with other children  wow laugh   uh huh   mm hmm mm hmm   and so he'd probably or she'd probably be quite bored   with that particular topic  mm hmm   and here was this really nice equestrian topic   to to to discuss   mm mm   and i always bet my bottom dollar that that was gonna  going to work  and the other two topics that i picked were usually rather uninteresting bland topics so then i knew that the  equestrian one would be really likely laugh   word   mm   right laugh right laugh   and of course i i   had the i had the uhm the   ease and the and the uh comfort zone to be able to pull it off i with this terminology and so i always got really good grades in oral communication skills in a second language  laugh   that was well planned   mm hmm   loud inhale so hopefully our children will be quite so ingenious and and be able to  well y w on the street there's a there are a couple of girls up the street   faye tina jennifer and what is really wonderful is that the doors are opened for martha whereas some other kids they can only play with the french ki uh  with the english kids  tha that's all  they they feel comfortable with  mm hmm   but the language is a real barrier once you get up to the age where our kids are around eight years old and and so martha can  can play with the english kids  mm hmm   she can play with the french  and if everybody's out in the street then everybody's out  but but it really opens up the world for her to be able to go and and play with these kids as well  mm hmm  and and so some of the things that uh marmaduke was talking about about about  applying it after school uhm become a little less forced because you just begin at an early age to make friends that are speaking that other language  and little peter today  mm hmm   my peter wanted to go up and he wants so badly to play with little julien and jean-jaques and  paul-henri and pierre-louis and and   sebastien all the little boys  mm hmm   up the top of the street is french  down the bottom of the street is english  word   and he wants to go up and play with these little guys  and he says ah i wanna want to   i wanna want to speak french  i wanna want to communicate  mm hmm  so what uh i'm hoping the same thing will happen with him that the incentive will be there and that he'll be able to go out and practice his craft on the street  and learn those everyday things  mm hmm 
Canada	 mm hmm  utterance   mm hmm hmm   i cannot unders yes and and  th the the parents  on the street on our street they speak very slowly and very nicely to me so i can understand them and eventually we start talking in english because laugh just out of trying to communicate e effectively   laugh   mm hmm  and i cannot understand what the children say at all  i h i don't understand one thing that any child o on the street says and i don't understand why  mm hmm  but their their voice is  different it's it's it's squeakier   you you know   mm hmm mm hmm   and th they talk very quickly and uhm i don't understand a word so i'm kind of odd when martha goes up and  she can she can understand and bat it back and forth with these kids  and i think as as uh marmaduke  said you know if i went to a lot of french courses i'd s  i have this feeling that i would still come back and still not understand all these kids word   they have all that academic stuff   word mm hmm mm hmm   that's right yeah   is there uh just going back to the document for a few minutes i'm just thinking is there  something uhm specific that you wanted me to do for y  for the committee in terms of uhm uhm  word this school helping to uhm put together a position paper in other words  mm hmm sure   mm hmm   kay okay   uhm cos i understand that what you've done now is a draft uhm and it's out there for consultation at this point  mm hmm   yeah  and on the twelfth we'll be getting back together again   hmm   mm hmm   uhm and we'll be expecting people to come forward with suggestions and submissions   absolutely   okay  and do you have an idea what you're looking for what kind of feedback you're looking for from people  i want to know if what is on the paper reflects what you want to retain because really what this paper is about we've already handed into the board philosophically what an  &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re is and why we hold it so dear  all of us hold it so dear  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  but when it comes to our school if we are relocated   what is what is near and dear to us  what do we want to tell the board that that   we ask that you you take into account  mm hmm   and it's very important to us in trying not to alter for us  mm hmm   and so that list what i would like you to do uhm   an and you would be a wonderful help in this is to look at that and to see if there's anything left out or anything just not said as effectively as it could  do you know what i understand uh  what i mean   okay   and if if anything is  uhm anything isn't right if you would let me know before the meeting that would be great  okay   do you wanna want to go through it now  we can if you want  i've got a rough draft upstairs if if uhm if  i can just unhook   yeah   that okay   yeah   okay that would be great short tape break   i'm gonna going to  i'm gonna going to read it  just because it's one or two words   okay   okay  we the &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re  fatima hopefully it'll be orientation school and home and school committees  mm hmm  this is being sent out to members of all committees so they all have a chance to see it  mm hmm  have listed uhm the uhm i i  changed that from basic requirements to primary requirements of our school in the event that relocation of our population is considered by the leedsman school board  we look forward to working closely with our board if our school is affected by relocation  point one a building centrally located to our population  a fatima building situated between spruces  boulevard and churchill boulevard would be geographically and uhm we're also adding north of highway thirty word  would be geographically appropriate for our clientele  mm hmm   mm hmm  so not hitting them between the eyes with it but just saying  mm hmm   word for them  uhm a relocation as a unit of a current student body  we would continue to be an &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re  comprised of both eligible and non-eligible students   we wanna want to be sure that  there is no problem with the eligible students continuing to go to the school  especially if an uhm if   the neighbourhood school concept is brought in and there's uhm early immersion that we still are allowed to uhm go and be bussed   to our school  mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  keeping our current &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re fatima staff that includes teachers administrators support staff word   uhm let's see  keeping our school name as &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re fatima   mm hmm  uh facilities miss elizabeth helped out with which allow for extended kindergarten daycare music room specialist room classes with windows and non-crowded environment  something about taking into account the needs of our special uhm uh all the children but especially the special needs students really need breathing space  mm hmm  okay  mm hmm  and then ha ha  just uh uh et if i could just interject here for a second   mm hmm   sure   mm hmm   uhm i'm just wondering uh how many how many children in our school population have special needs and should we be identifying that in this particular letter  we've not   no  i don't know and that's a good point  you know for attention deficit which is a  a specific need is just five and that's not a lot of the population  i don't know if there are other specific needs that are being addressed  i imagine oh i know they're not because i've  i've seen seen kids with different needs  mm hmm   but uhm yes that's a good point   that's a good point  you can see even you see this was this was uhm o some of the old drafts  i'm not even sure if i may have even taken that off so you'll see  in in whatever that comes out whether that's on  if it's on it's a good point to bring up  mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  kay okay   notification the last point uhm and this was changed a little bit but this is the basic gist of it  notification uhm of if there is notification  of uhm of closure of our building  we want to know well before the time that the actual closure would take place and at the same time that closure is notified we also want to know which building we are being moved to  and that the reason for this is that we want to give this information to our population and prepare everyone for their relocation without uhm oh i don't know  to ensure for a smooth transition  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah   yeah   and and and also i added something about uh this'll make sure that our e p p the our e p p   parents uh feel secure about the situation and part of the process  that type of thing  so that they're you know they're they   know what's going on all along  it'll be very hard on people to h oh by the way we're closing your school and then well the school building which to people are their is their school and uhm i you're left hanging in mid-air so so  to uh not do that  mm hmm   and then a closing inviting uh some  some sort of closing to say again that we we wish to   we wish to look forward to uhm uhm a   a good uhm resolution to to this type of situation with the board and we look forward to working with them  on it  something to say that we're willing to to  go halfway on this  we just  we wanna want to cooperate   however give us our needed time and  and you know keep us keep us  in the position where we feel that we can we can help you to make a difference to make people happy  yeah   yeah   e   that's it  uhm   cos we're both winners if it comes out that way huh  yeah   there's something that that came up as you were talking about the advance notice  uhm i've had some experience in this in that  the daycare that uhm kathy went to as a young child uhm  relocated uh and and it was r  it was a really tough decision actually because the daycare had only been in existence for about two years  when the building was slated for demolition  mm hmm   oh my  and uhm we were uhm we were   all a little saddened by it and yet we all saw it as a positive move   because the location that we were now being offered was bigger and better  mm   hmm  uh bigger uhm in the sense of spacewise uh and also uhm outside the building the uh the playground area was much much bigger so there were a lot of really great plusses to it  uhm better in the sense that uhm we felt uhm it was a more homey kind of atmosphere that we were going to be moving to although it was uhm a a  duplex uh that had been renovated  uh huh   mm   the other duplexes in the area were all university buildings  mm hmm  and so there was a degree of not commercialism but i guess institutionalism uhm on the street you know   mm hmm   mm hmm   uhm and it was a very short little space so uhm it didn't have that homey feeling  mm hmm  and then we went up against opposition of uhm our local residents of our new building who did not want the daycare to be situated on their street  mm hmm   not in my backyard syndrome and uh  i just find that amazing for a daycare   mm hmm   i mean it's it's   well i i just find it surprising that people are are as uh contrary to  word this this whole idea  it's hard  it's   mm hmm mm hmm it is   we just hear on the news now about what's going on about the daycare  mm hmm  yeah there's one right now that uh i think one of the canadian uh government officials wrote a letter on uh government stationary word uhm   laugh yeah   yeah the the residents thought we were gonna going to be ripping up and down the streets with our cars dropping our children off at all hours and  you know  hmm   ah in in reality i mean  we've really blended into the into the  community quite nicely and uhm and   we've we've had some interesting uh uh get-togethers with the community and invited them to come and visit and we had an open house and they could come in and tour the  facilities and what not   i would think so   mm hmm   and i think that was a very positive experience and  and that might be something that we have to look  at  and also uhm  mm hmm   that's a good idea  so we tried to we tried to look at it from the community's perspective   mm   and we tried to look at it from the children's perspective  and then so well in advance we explained to the children that the building was going to be taken down uhm but it was for a positive step because they were going to be building a new high school and it was really important for the boys of this particular school to have the space that they needed  and so we tried to encourage them to understand uhm the process a little bit more  mm hmm  so that when they saw the being the building being torn down if it came to that that none of them would be frightened  mm hmm  and so we had to prepare the children and we had to prepare the community that we were moving into and we had to prepare the parents of the children who were also whose lives were also being affected by all of this   how did you affect the community  how did we   how did you let them know to take away some of that anxiety that they had  uhm probably uhm uh th the uh  the most uhm difficult thing to do actually was to have a meeting with the community  we invited uhm everyone on the street to come and uh meet with us  and it was a somewhat antagonistic uh meeting  mm hmm  uhm a lot of people came with with  uh padded agendas and lists of complaints and ideas  mm hmm   and what we did was that we basically just tried to handle the questions one on one uhm gently uh and with a with uh a a strong degree of tact   and and   mm hmm mm hmm   uh e we tried to uhm we tried to impress upon them that we were of a cooperative nature and so if there was something that they were really opposed to that we didn't feel was something absolutely necessary then we were c going to accommodate them  mm hmm  uhm so what we did was they were very concerned about us driving up and down the street so we agreed that we would not use the front doors of the building  and we designed the building so that people would have to come through the campus and park on the campus parking lot facilities and come in through the back door to eliminate s  the additional stress on the street that they thought  that they were going to have  oh oh   mm 
Canada	 and in fact i uhm many of the people who live in the street inquired about six to eight months after we had taken uh residency in the building uhm as to whether or not they were eligible t  laugh to come to our daycare   mm hmm mm hmm   laugh   unfortunately they weren't because uh you had to be a member of of the i it was a worksite daycare so you had to be a member of the institution in order to be able put your children there  mm hmm mm hmm   probably the hardest uhm the hardest   experience that we came across was uhm a child who was longing   to to come and play in the playground  aw   uhm and so what we did do was we suggested to the parent that uh during the daytime when the other children were outside  as long as the child was healthy uhm they could  they could come and and play and participate but the parent would have to observe the child and make sure that they weren't getting into fights and things like that   mm hmm mm   mm hmm mm hmm   but we we welcomed her into the community but we did have to lock the gates in the evening because for uhm insurance purposes and security purposes we couldn't leave it open  sure  so uhm i think that those kinds of issues help them to  settle into us and us to them uh  uh you were just you were just  saying what can well what can i do in this process  in being sensitive to the needs of all the people involved  i mean tha it's it's  the the teachers are going to tape cuts out   word   mm hmm  and the administration as well and our committees  and the population as a whole the students the board   they all have a slightly different perspective on this  our commissioners  mm hmm  and even the most our commissioners it's   it's different because some are parents v p p and   some some are not  mm hmm  so uhm so so trying to make this a   a word   what you did about that you know uh taking away  the anxiety from at different times from different groups and and making people feel  secure that their their voice will be heard and taken into account  mm hmm mm hmm   people get afraid  they get afraid that that  there's a there's a hidden agenda and everybody's  gonna going to be pushed to the side in whatever group they're not in you know   mm hmm   it's very frightening sometimes   mm hmm   well there was one person who lived on the street who campaigned very hard uhm with with the town uh with the uhm city of uhm sorry i don't know whether it was  toronto west or a if it was g n a cos it's right on the border so   mm hmm mm hmm   but i know that th there  was there was a lot of discussion as to whether or not this uhm particular uhm daycare was actually going to take  place there  mm hmm  and uhm she she campaigned quite hard and she got quite a few of the neighbours riled  and and and ready to go to battle over this  mm hmm mm hmm   uhm but i think wh when   you meet people face to face even if that first encounter isn't as pleasant as one would hope it would be we're all human and we all really want the same things which is s space   and peace and tranquility and clean air and all the things that they wanted were the things that we wanted   mm hmm   and so uh we uh i guess just by uhm  presenting ourselves uhm and almost using the opportunity to push ourselves on them made them realize that we weren't the big monster the big ogre that that uhm he unknown entity  that they thought  and so my feeling is that we should be addressing in this letter the need for us to uhm be able to identify with these different groups as early as possible so that we can make people feel comfortable about the move and and   so that the community that we eventually re  relocate to feels comfortable about the fact that we are now going to be in their word   mm hmm   mm hmm   that is an excellent idea   so that would be a logical extension of this point  mm hm mm hmm  i think it's a very important point to address too because i think it makes people realize they the  need for advance notice and to be part of the process  it is   mm hmm   that's all we're asking for is enough time so that we can adjust and the people around us will adjust and and   and tha that's time  there's there's a healing process that has to happen  you have to have closure and you have to have an open house perhaps whereby people in the community   din come can come   mm hmm mm hmm   word wonderful idea  an open house so people can picture themselves in this environment  mm hmm mm hmm  so what i'd like to see is perhaps a relocation committee   organized where events can be planned uhm  and and we can try and and   take into consideration the anxieties of the children and the parents and the and the and the community that we're moving into as well as some of the concerns that the  leedsman school board may have  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  and when they read the letter i would also  that that very point if if  it sufficiently states that we want to work with the board on this process if it's sufficiently accommodating to their position because they're in a difficult spot  it's hard financially to come up with the money they have to  so i want the tenor of the letter to carry that  so you want uh so what we're saying then is we want to make sure that we have advance notice in order for us to form a relocation committee so that we can work with the teachers administration committee members parents students uh the school board and the community uhm   and the community that's right  and and to do it within budget  mm hmm  i think if uhm if  it's done well i think that we can integrate and and and  perhaps even draw more students from the   from the direct community that that   we relocate to   oh i agree i agree  i think uhm sarah mailer's point uhm was very well taken that we're uhm we're so far from the people we serve that other client possible clientele many of them don't even consider us because we're not part of their lives  we're building w so far away  they never see it  mm hmm  they never think of it as an opportunity and it's frightening to send your tiny child all that way  mm hmm  so uhm we'll be we'll be  more in the midst of a community seen as a option  yeah  what i can do perhaps is work on uhm j the second segment then i wr a a a   a further extension of your letter  by talking about you know the importance of advance notice  specifically for this ro for this purpose   relocation purpose  mm hmm   okay   uhm that might help  that's fine   i i if i can get it uhm if i can get it to you before the committee and have and have copies made so that we can pass them out to people people can read it at the committee and comment on it   at the same time as they're commenting on yours   mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   uhm i think that's probably the best route isn't it   yeah and then we can sandwich it   what i'd i'd like you to do is when you get this letter uh if there's a way that this can be  sandwiched in do you know what i mean   mm hmm   that it it it may mean for example  rewriting point six  mm hmm  okay  mm hmm   or it may be reorganizing the   the whole way the letter is done and if that   if it it says it better then that's the way we should do it  but if uhm if we can if if people can look at this and say okay i think that   that this needs to be added in and take what you've done and sort of w   i i would like for them that night to walk away having a good picture of what they're voting on  mm hmm  so if there's something that is a logical insertion we move this up we move this down and this goes in here  mm hmm   right  that would really be helpful so that they don't go away  the only concern i had that was so important that they don't go away thinking that we're going to continue to develop this afterward  i'd like them to get a good feeling  do you know what i mean  without with some small tinkering but a good feeling like this is what they're voting on is what's going   out and for you to come tonight and get these ideas ready is perfect  right and   so if you have that ready and copied and this letter is ready and copied and any other ideas that come in uhm ho that's why i want to get them before the meeting so that they're down  mm hmm   and we'll be able to compose this in a final form pretty well at the meeting and vote on it because  we need the vote of the school committee to to  send it in  mm hmm   yeah i guess that's probably the best way to handle it is  to to uhm to do it that way cos there's very little time left before the end of the school year   unfortunately yeah   i'm just wondering if uhm let's assume that i get this tomorrow and if i did have time to write something up  mm hmm   mm hmm  would you want me to distribute it ahead of time so that people have a chance to look at it and see the changes or do you think that would confuse people  let's see  of course it depends on how much i write and i won't know how much i write until i sit down and do it  yeah you know the school  are you going to be home tomorrow  no i'm not mm   okay uhm  i'm home on the weekend though  because the because i know  that cher's going to be in tomorrow and i'm sure she's going to be working on this  okay   i'm almost positive  mm hmm  she could fax me a copy  so there   that would be great  there you go  and we can take a look at it and see  it may be that there may be some  some things you'd you'd like to see uhm  sentences we were doing or or or some things like minor things that you'd like to see  and here there may be sent a couple sentences you wanna want to put in  in that case then uhm i think that can be done at the meeting  mm hmm  dontcha don't you think  mm hmm   that that that that   could be done   the minor things yeah  there's things i'm not as worried about uh the nuances and things we can we can  play with at the meeting and i think people can people will a af appreciate being part of that process  yeah   right  uhm   and this point here now  whether people have it prior to the meeting  mm hmm   my feeling is that i think that i can't imagine anybody not agreeing with us  i think that's such a super point  so i guess we can't lose by sending it to people before the meeting but i think that if we do it at the meeting  w they're going to uh redo it as well   mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  okay it's it's uh it's logical  uh   it's just that if you give them so much information sometimes people don't actually read the whole thing before people other people start commenting and then uhm you may be commenting without having read the whole thing and and   not not feeling comfortable with it so   it really depends on the length of what i do  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   if i do something that's fairly lengthy   then i would like to be able to uhm to  have people have a look at it even if it's only  even if it's only the the   night before  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm  uhm you know it's just so that they have an idea as to what my proposed changes to the letter would be so that they're not hit off guard with it you know   mm hmm mm hmm   good point 
Canada	 pair of skis  uh huh  well the first thing the first thing   i need to know is first of all what size do i need   because i'm not sure  well it depends what are you looking f like are you looking for skis or are you looking for boots or are you looking for everything   well okay i guess well i'll start with the skis  okay and we can look at the skis but i need to make  i need to be sure what length i'm supposed to get  mm hmm   uhm well you need  well first of all two or three words  consider have you been skiing for a long time  uhm i've been skiing   well how long have i been skiing i dunno don't know since well since i was a teenager so like eleven ten years i guess  and what what level do you consider yourself to be  would you say you'd be beginner intermediate advanced  uhm i would say intermediate  like i don't ski that often but i've been skiing and i'm pretty good you know like i've   mm   and i'm like daring you know i'm not like a wimpy  person one or two words but  and how much do you weigh  weigh  laugh starts secret question laugh ends   about a hundred and twenty  a hundred and twenty okay   the reason why the reason why i ask people why why how much they weigh  is we need to accomodate we need to be able to find the skier some  suitable skis for the knees of the skier  uh huh   why  two words length as well as weight because one thing that's important when you're looking for skiing for a good ski is uh you need your weight to be evenly distributed throughout the ski  two or three words because what happens is you're not using the tip of your ski and then with that you lose a lot of grip on the ice and you word you're not  getting enough of the ski  your legs are more balanced on the ski there than using maximum leverage on the ski and you gain more control  well wait a second i don't understand   depending on how much i weigh you put the  put  the binding in the right place  mm hmm   well it depends   no no it it's more it's more like   jerry's jerry's a  jerry's g a good skier right  jerry's around your height and weight  if you have somebody that's uh two hundred and twelve odd pounds for example you wanna want to put them on a ski that's a hundred a hundred and seventy-seven centimetres in length   because ideally we want the weight to be evenly distributed around the ski  mm hmm   mm hmm  the reason for this is what happens if the weight is too concentrated in the centre the person weighs too much for the ski the ski is not long enough what'll happen is that the person is not able the ski does not functioning to that person's ability  but what'll ha but you might   word cos there's uh there's not enough  word there's not enough weight distributed throughout the ski  okay drawn out   so what happens is so for example when people are on ice the ski will lose its grip  oh so that's so that's the whole point of having different length skis is   right  it varies according to your height and to your weight  and your weight  okay so it's both combined  cos yeah i always knew the height but i didn't know the weight  right  so don't aren't you gonna  going to ask me how tall i am or   well uh actually i can see how tall you are  utterance   oh take a guess how tall am i  i word   well you see that's the thing is that's why it's usually good to have a ski right there so i can line it up word   body   for a beginner skier we usually go head height   the intermediate skier you usually want between five and fifteen centimetres over your head  there's a word to five inches  right   and and then  basically advanced or expert skier you should uhm word  you give em them some advice      word   the word skier knows how long a ski they need by their own ability and how they can how they can  word their turns and they know whether a ski is too long for them or not  if they feel they can control it then it's not a problem to them  okay   that you know  one thing yeah that's one thing that's   a problem that usually happens when people   you know with kids the parents the parents  are always concerned about the length of the skis so sometimes they want it to be bigger and longer word  you know when they're growing  oh okay   they can keep the ski for a few years  oh yeah  speaker has short conversation with an extra-corpus speaker   that's not very professional  speaker finishes conversation with extra-corpus speaker  sorry uhm   ya as i was saying as i was saying basically uh   what the hell was i saying   you were talking about the length of the ski  uh the l uhm the h   you were talking about kids  like sometimes the parents want   right  like sometimes sometimes  the parents will want a longer ski so they don't have to buy them the next year   oh really  ya  so tha that sometimes happens but the thing is is really the safety of of  the skier is the first and foremost important thing to worry about  oh really   it's not always that important to go for the sale  it's really important to look for uh for  the important thing to to   a safe ski   you know ideally what you wanna want to   do is you wanna want to suit the skier  for their needs  like you wanna want to find them the right equipment so that what they're getting is uh something that's uh you know something that's uh something that's  gonna going to like suit their needs as a skier and not uh  you know something that they can use   cos it's no fun it's like if somebody goes out to buy a porsche  and uh they're sold a subaru they're not getting what they're looking for  right right   whereas if there's someone's looking for a subaru if they want a practical car for the weekends or climbing hills or just word basic needs they're not looking at a   sor sports car  right  so ideally what you wanna want to   do is you wanna want to suit the skier's needs  and you wanna want to give them the best possible product for their needs  okay   uhm do you need ski boots  ah one thing that we usually do is when we're suiting up a  we're outfitting ah a customer or a skier it's usually best to start with the boots because that's usually what takes the longest amount of time  yeah  ya  well i'll take a look at the boots but uh the truth is i already have a pair  you already have a pair  yeah  alright uhm   alright  look i i wouldn't mind just looking at the boots just to see what you have available just one or two words like it so  sure   you never know i might wanna want to   upgrade approximately 20 seconds of hubbub; no conversation; b is perhaps humming?   utterance   more extra-corpus conversation? uhm uhm  are these all second-hand or  no these are all new boots  okay these are all new  ya   so   and uhm basically in terms of price they range around from ninety-nine dollars uh word down  word but but   really they're from about ninety-nine dollars sorry  sist sixty-three dollars for a junior ski boot  right up to let's see here two or three words but uh  uh around two hundred dollars depending   oh really   and that's so yeah some of these prices have been marked down from uh about two seventy-five  so the savings are are you know quite quite uhm you know uh  significant  ya  how how come you guys have such  you know good prices  like why do you get a good deal  so what we do is we're liquidating all of our own equipment and all the old equipment for uh for  somebody else and uh  so it's worked out we get to make a profit off some of that money  you mean for some companies that haven't sold their equipment you're liquidating for them  exactly  oh okay   so this is where actually uh somebody three or four words thomas we liquidate his equipment and as we said we make some of the money off him and he makes some of the money off us   so   okay   i it's a good balance  yeah it's a good  absolutely there are things that it helps uh   yeah it works for both people and helps uh it helps us get  you know it helps us to make raise  money more so that we can compete on the circuit   i see  so basically you're making money for your ski team you get a  nice big deal and you're liquidating their stock so everybody's   mm hmm   exactly everybody everybody  benefits from that   okay  so what's the difference between these boots like uh i mean besides the price  besides the price okay   laugh   uhm  cos are these ones like one thirty these ones're two thirty so it's something  okay look a take these two what's the difference between them  well first of all the difference is there's  there's a little bit of a difference in the sense that this one was ah actually a woman's boot and this one's a men's boot  and   in terms of  okay   why uh why do men and women need different boots   well generally the thing is is that uh most of men's feet are a little bit word shaped a bit differently than women's feet to be a bit wider and uh to be a bit longer as well  most of the time most most men usually weigh a bit more than women and therefore they need a little bit stiffer boot  but ah each boot varies according to the ability of the skier  okay  for example this one here's a beginner boot  why is it a beginn ing boot like what  makes it word   well what makes it a beginner boot  well the thing is is when you're looking at a different  boot is you're looking at uh not so much career but   you're looking more at uh you're looking more in terms  of uh the flex of the boot uhm the stiffness of the boot rigidity  what kind of support it offers and whether it flexes a lot or they don't  see it all varies and when you have a beginner skier it's really important that they're able to bend their knees and to apply pressure to the skis in order to complete the turn  okay  and what's happened is uh if  what happens is if you put a beginner skier in an advanced boot   what happens is the boot's so stiff is that they're   gonna going to have a lot of problems turning the ski because they're not able to transfer pressure from the foot onto the ski  therefore and vice versa with an advanced skier if you have somebody who 're very heavy or very strong then that weight is gonna going to crush the boot and the boot will not control according to the weight   i'm sorry what their weight is gonna  going to crush the boot or because  their weight and their strength the weight word  the ski it varies right  it it it really depends  right  and in general when you have somebody who's a   like a more advanced skier you have someone who's a more advanced skier they tend to be a little bit more aggressive uhm  these are all important questions that we ask or we asked a skier before before outfitting them  word   okay  so what happens the reason why we ask so many questions sometimes people can become offended when we're asking   you know they become a little bit word why are you asking so many questions  but the only reason why is that that   you can best you know out out outfit  the needs of the skier to the best support word  mm   right  to their needs  right okay   that's why we ask so many questions  okay  but uhm  so this one's a beginner boot so that probably wouldn't be good for me   uhm no  but you see that's the other thing too is sometimes if you have an advanced if you have a if you have a beginner skier   who weighs you know three hundred and eighty pounds if you have  a you know ah a pleasantly plump  customer who ah who wants you know who would like to ski the in some ways you want   chances are that uh hi his  weight will most likely he'll need   a bit of a stiffer boot because he weighs a lot more and therefore he needs the support  mm   okay  so he 'll take a more advanced boot not because he's a good skier but because he's big  right  totally  you're not you're not gonna  going to sell him the top of the line boot because the thing is he's not gonna going to use that  but at the same time you wanna want to get something 
Canada	 all right this is a ski from rossignol  ya   it's a it's a it's a sporty ski  it's an advanced ski  it's word advanced  it's intermediate  excuse me cough   advanced  it's for the advanced intermediate skier  okay  okay  the uh s p s it's called the the   sport ski  what it is is basically an e two version of their  uh their uh ski word called the four s  the four s came out in eighty-eight  so uh it won many many olympic medals  okay   it's very highly regarded a good performance ski  very fun   hmm   it's a it's a very snappy ski  okay  uhm do you want to see here  do you want to hold that  it's very light   ya   okay  it's light  alright   maybe two word tonnes  of flexibility  okay  mm hmm  what type of skiing do you like to do  do you like to do uh do you like to do  short radius turns or long radius turns  do you like to ski moguls  well i like to do moguls but i'm not that great at them but i'm trying to do them like with shorter turns instead of making the big loops around like i'm trying  to cut them you know  mm hmm mm   right right right   mm hmm  so  so it seems to me as though you're looking for something that's a pretty quick turning ski something snappy something that's easily moveable  ya   ya that's it   okay   therefore when you're looking for something like that you're looking for something that's uh that's soft on the shovel  okay that's the front of the ski at the top  okay  okay  ya  oh ya that's pretty flexible   it flexes pretty easily   ya   so that way what happens is it's easy to initiate in turn  okay  it's easy to begin a turn and hold   and then what you want is something that's a little bit uh stiffer  in the in the tail okay in the back of the ski  something that's a little bit stiffer  that way you know that way what happens is it whips you out of your turns and it prepares you for your next turn  right   mm hmm   okay  okay usually that's generally the kind of word  ski you're going to look for for someone that's   ah for a skier who's looking for you know for to do  to do short radius turns  mm   but the reason for that is just that uh you know it's easy to begin the turn it's easy to come out of it and prepare the  word   and when you have somebody who's looking for a lot for a g s ski which also means giant slalom they're making bigger turns generally they have more even flex so you   a more more of an even flex to the skier  it slides   it's it's an equal flex and what that does is when they're connecting their turns they just go long and smoothly  they don't have to wo worry   about their weight about the changing of their weight  so much  okay   so it's uh you know it's  it's quite something  it's it's it's word   it's a great ski  it's super light  word too you're looking for something that's  torsionally stiff   okay  and this particular word okay is quite  it's quite torsional   what that means is bas basically    torsch   what's the word  torsion  torsion   okay   one ski is torsionally  it's sort of ah maybe two words adding an a l l y to the end of the words  most of a phrase that torsionally is stiff  okay that that that basically regulates the amount of torque that you have in a ski how much it  how much it rotates when you're carving your turn  okay  and so what happens is a ski that's more  that's ah stiffer torsionally means it's  gonna going to hold better on ice  right   that's the difference be  between that's one of the differences that you look at between like a beginner's ski and an advanced ski  right   you know how the advanced skis are   they generally tend to be more stiffer torsional  because they're applying more pressure on their ski and they  they're using more of their leg and so what's happening is they need something that's gonna going to   be strong and that's going to be holding up to the pressure and  the you know the weight that they put on their ski  mm hmm   okay  okay  therefore it's gonna going to hold better  okay and when you have a uh when you have   one of the word you know not as stiff torsionally generally what tends to happen is that the uh the  ski does not hold as well on ice  okay  and when you have a beginner's ski because they're not  i'll tell you what happens when they when they make their turns is as they're turning as they're turning they're not uhm they're not  putting as much pressure on they're not using the ski as much  that's generally what happens  and as they make the transition as they as their  skiing improves you know they the skier will make the turn from the tip of the ski all the way to the end  ya   as opposed to just in a certain area   as as opposed to using it more as opposed to pivoting the ski more  okay  generally what tends to happen is people tend to   tend to pivot their ski  so ju just moving your foot instead of the whole ski kinda kind of   exactly  that's ten tends   that's generally what happens sometimes when you have  when you have ah a beginner skier  whereas when you have an advanced skier they use something  something to uh to   word a little more  sure   they use the entire ski  okay  and therefore this one is fairly torsion word  so it's going to hold pretty well on the ice  ya   it's a light-weight ski  it's phrase/unclear>  you know it's good for doing short radius turns  and uh it's uh it's pretty stable at high speeds as far as you wanna want to look for   right   what do you mean stable at high speeds   well generally what happens is the ski doesn't chatter  what happens is when you're uh when you're when you're skiing is you go faster sometimes what happens if the skier if it if there's not enough weight in front of the ski we tend to find the skier move from left to right  they'll constantly move left to right like   like   oh binding   ya exactly  it'll be like word chatter  i had skis that did that  when i'd get going really fast it'd be like ah ah ah ah like that  like i'd be shaking  ya   see that's the thing is it's generally the way that skis   are are constructed  that's something that you're going to have to look for  so this has like shock absorbers or something laugh   is that what they have   well it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't  have shock absorbers  uh the floor actually does shock absorb  so i guess what they call the v a s it's vibration absorption system whereas this one does not have it  okay   okay  uhm can you excuse me one for one   minute   sure  i just want to check to make sure a few words  okay about 40 seconds without talking   sorry  it's okay   so uh i dunno don't know   like uh like i you know they look fine or whatever and they sound good but uh i just find them a bit expensive  mm hmm   you know it's like i don't   well   but that that's only the ski one ninety-five and then you've got the binding too   right the thing is right you can either spend  if you want i can i can i can i can  give you a ski for a hundred bucks and a binding for a hundred bucks but you know what you're gonna going to finish the ski  the ski is gonna going to lose its life in about uh a year or two years  mm hmm   and it'll feel great at first cos it's a new ski but what happens is because it will be receiving so much abuse  they're not designed that way they're not made to word  so  right   right   what about this section over here  is there anything there that  uh generally those skis are probably a little bit more   expensive  if you wanna want to take a look   no it's okay it's okay  if they're more expensive i don't know   do you are have all the skis you're  gonna going to be getting in second-hand are they all here already   they're all here already  oh  ya   our uh our deadline for bringing stuff in was tuesday however we did extend it an extra day  you did eh  mm hmm  what about poles  you have second-hand poles  no  you don't   why  cos they get bent  well   poles get get bent all the time  poles are not that expensive usually  generally poles it's not something that you usually buy second-hand  if you want to hand them down to somebody else you could  okay   i like this jacket   do you have a jacket  i have a ski jacket but i'm looking for like a winter jacket  mm hmm   are you looking for something more of like a parka type thing  as opposed to a ah as opposed to a bomber  a bomber is something that goes down to about your waist  like   nah i don't want a bomber   i like this coat  is this down  uhm i'll take a look here   yup it is down feathers two words   it's good  it's nice  i like it  mm hmm  it's nice eh   is this the regular price or is it marked down from this  uh it's marked down  it's usually priced at two nineteen ninety-five  this word is the word  i'll have to take a look over at this rack   and word   i'm not sure  actually i'll have to check on the number maybe two words conversation between b and extra-corpus speakers   so   so how much is this jacket  uhm this one here this is a maybe three words    this one model  which model is it  three one eight four   let me take a look here   no uh  so how much did i say it was   three one eight four you said and it's regularly two nineteen  uhh two nineteen ninety-five and right now it's selling for one sixty-nine ninety-five  would you say that's a good price  that's not bad   it's a pretty good price   like cheaper   it's all right   i like it   but do you think uh  you think you can get it at   do you get a lot of jackets   laugh   well cos i i want a coat but i need a  coat jacket that i can wear like to work you know  right  i don't think  i dunno don't know   could i wear that to work   uhm word maybe two words  maybe  or maybe if i got it in a more toned colour or something  conversation between b and extra-corpus speakers   what  well does that come in other colours or   ya i think these are some of the other colours  this one here is pretty nice   uh no that one's more of a bomber  that one's more of a bomber  i don't know if this one here is word  men's model or not  that looks kind of like a men's   what about these purple ones   oh that's a different jacket eh   ya that's a different jacket   so that i think it's word   okay   sure   kay okay let's talk about some  stuff that's coming up in the next three weeks four weeks  ya  oh my lord   laugh   i wrecked this book  what's happening with potage l&eacute;gume   uhh i have to call raj today  and i have to go to prairie des poivrons with him   next week   ya   they're still there   ya  i thought he picked them up  no   exasperated breath   that's what he told me on sunday  so next week  so next week uhh it still won't be there   no it's off off off off   it's off until two words   until we get the cubes  yup   okay   so that's okay   so i'll write that out 
Canada	 ya  you need something that's go going    you need a tougher ski  i want something that holds on ice because i like  i need to tackle that ice  laugh it's like you know what i mean though  it's so so often you go and there's lots of ice  i want like good sharp edges and ski so i can feel in control on ice as much as possible you know  right   sure  well you know i mean uh that's why sometime you're going to have to spend a little bit more because the thing is is that you need   when you go into uh when you go into   into uh more advanced skis usually you're getting something that's a little bit lighter a little bit stronger  okay and so what happens is you're using better materials okay using better materials  better fibreglass stronger epoxy  mhh hmm   right   uhm it's it's it's a lot  there's many many many many considerations okay   okay   is there a ski like this like that would be comparable  like uh this is the only ski that you've showed me in this line  are there oth other   can i see like the other skis that are in this line  sure  what do you want to see   well just show me what you have  well uhm  that's what a k two  that's a k two  this is a k two  it's on a two words   it's a   it's not great though  isn't like isn't like carhartt  or  ya it's a good name  rossignol's a good name  every ski here is a good name  right  everything   even this elan business  elan has actually made a lot of improvements over the past few years  they're not   but they're not   they're not very highly regarded a number of years ago  ya that's what i heard   however they they've worked a lot  their engineers designed a lot of word skis where you see two words materials making better   word   mm hmm  uhm and as a result as a result  they were able to develop some some excellent skis  a lot of people were very pleased with them  okay  they tested very well on the market by testers  and most of the people who test these skis are at level four instructors ah level three level four which uh  level four in canada i think you're talking about uh  eight eight to ten people who have that  oh so real hotshots   ya   it's it's very limited  they're very technical skiers  they really they know how to work a ski  they know how to gain a performance from a ski  right  and uh you know it's it's they're very  they're top notch  they're top quality skiers and they can tell the difference between they can tell the difference between  between a beginner ski and ah and an  advanced skier's ski  right right   so if you put  what i was referring to before about you having to spend more money it's that if i put you if i put a type four  skier on a on a on a beginner ski   you know he'll be able to ski with it or she will be able to ski with it however the thing is is that they the ski  will not perform to that to the skier's ability  right   right   and then what happens is they become frustrated and they'll probably take them off and they'll trash them right away  okay  now jus just   now just remember a few words saving  is is is is is word  are no good   okay well i'm not a level four uh  laugh i'm not even a level one  okay   i'm minus laugh five or something so   okay   uh so what else  what uh what other skis here like   would would you re recommend    well what would you recommend like if  what would i recommend  like a good price for a word ski kind of thing  well one of the things i like to ask is i like to ask you what were skiing on before  uhm well first i h had   well i had heads but somebody ripped them off  uh huh  and before that it was like these spaldings like  word   spaldings are a really good ski actually  ya but they're old  i mean they were like at least  like i bought them second-hand about ten years ago so  they're probably like at least fifteen years old  mhh hmm   and i took them  also when i got new boots i went to get them adjusted and uh you know took the skis and the guy said to me he goes these skis are not safe to ski on because the bindings are so old  mhh hmm  and i was like oh okay whatever  and then the weirdest thing was that uh that   i skied on them anyway for that day and then i hung them up that night and the next time like i went to the country the binding was lying on the floor laugh next to the ski  like it just fell off  ya   ya  so obviously ya was right   the person in the sales shop was pretty   right   ya   i'm lucky i didn't break my neck you know  it's important to listen to people that are in the ski shops because they make a recommendation like that chances are they usually  you know they're not they're being   honest  and the thing is is it's it's it's a difference between there's a difference between somebody saying this ski or this you know this binding is not sold  you know and trying to make your sale or for being honest and to make more and more   maybe three words   right   no ya he i don't think he  was making a sale because it was just like the shop where the  repairs word   ya   like the regular shop   was this at a ski hill or was it at   ya it was up a hill  it was up a hill  ya ya  see that's the thing is the people who work at the hills most of the people who work in the shops have to be uh certified  technicians   oh okay   and then they have to go through courses and they have to pass and make sure that uh they know how to do it  they know what they're doing   right   okay so you  so wait   so what were you skiing on before  you okay so you > had said the spaldings   spaldings spaldings   and then you had head word    and you never actually got to use them  head bindings   ya i never even tried them   ya   well uh you know heads uh heads are heads are a pretty good ski you know because uh   ya   so what do you have here that's a head   in head uhh let's see  we'll have to take a look and see   uhm let's take a look at head classic   head classic this isn't actually a bad ski   no  a few words   well   laugh you look like laugh   whoa you're not supposed to judge a ski by the  way it looks  well   exactly   yup  uhm anyways besides nobody's looking actually looking at you skis when you're skiing  ya only on the chair  only on the chair  it's a fashion statement you know it's always very important  that's the most important thing   laugh no word  fashion statement maybe three words   right  in my experience as a as a  salesperson you know i mean it happens  laugh   it happens  people are very kinda kind of   fashion conscious and uh they want something that looks good and  they want they want they want they they they themselves   wanna want to look good  yes   you know whereas when you have uh when you have people who are just caring about themself they're not usually looking for product   they are they are but at the same time it's not as important  ya it's secondary  ya it is   but at the same time you ain't  gonna going to buy something that you really think is ugly  well  well i'm not  i mean why buy something that's word   that doesn't surprise me to be honest   ya  laugh whatever  ha ha fake laugh   don't insult the customer   <[ honk honk   these are nice   what about these ones   a few words actually a pretty good ski  ya  uhm   how much are they  word four hundred dollars  four hundred dollars but they're marked down to two forty-five  two forty-five  yup   oh so these are all the prices down here  yup  so two twenty-five is the cheapest to you  phrase   three fifty   we also have some seven hundred dollar skis that are marked down to four seventy-five  ya well i'm not gonna going to be buying those  maybe we should look at the second-hand ones because the truth is i don't know really think i can afford a lot of this   okay   ya   these are more  oh these are more over here  ya  these are all  ya these are more over here  there's these uhm   oh really  ya  phrase   these are cheap eh ninety-five dollars   uhm  oh but but then  word   maybe three words   ya   this is actually i think this one here would be a pretty good ski for you  which one  the last one  ya  but they don't have your size so i'm not gonna  going to recommend it  okay   uhm   scratch that  not because two or three words   these ones is one seventy  oh you're talking about these ones  no i'm talking about these ones  there's a one seventy right here   ya word   but you said one seventy-five is better for me eh   that's a bit short eh  it's a bit short   one seventy one seventy-five a few words   ya  a few words   i fe feel i feel more comfortable i maybe three word ride on one seventy-five  ya  and how much are these   those are word   one ninety-five   mm hmm  mm  i'm gonna going to go look at the second laugh   oh so there's about two words eh  ya  and there's word huh  ya conversation drowned out by background noise, 55 seconds   what  they're what  those are  those are uh one eighty  those are one eighty  a hundred and eighty centimetres  that's too long  ya and there's no binding on them either  okay then that's no good   these are one seventies   ya  it's a junior ski though  how can you tell they're a junior ski just from looking at it  well it's my expertise you know  right laugh   laugh   okay   word a few words  what are they thinner like  they're a little bit thinner  uh they're not as strong not made for those people who are as heavy  generally the kids who word that  particular ski tend to be ah a little bit lighter  okay  so it's for smaller people conversation drowned out by background noise, 15 seconds   is that a good ski  yes this is a this is a very good ski  ya   however they're bent  they're bent  ya  look at that  oh  phrase   how much are they asking  they're asking uh two hundred dollars  eww oh i'm not paying for bent skis  no conversation drowned out by background noise, 10 seconds   i'd like to try it laugh   ya   have you ever seen one  no conversation drowned out by background noise, 15 seconds   they're only sixty-five dollars  phrase   what about for you  this is the   no   phrase   well what are they   what's that  what a are   a few words   a few words looking at uh the  word at two words   hmm   what about this pair back here  sorry   these ones  that one's a little bit long conversation drowned out by background noise, 25 seconds   so is that it for the second-hand bit   uh that's it for the second-hand  so uh you don't think there's anything here that would be good   uhm not really no  no   word phrase  conversation drowned out by background noise, 35 seconds   uh do do you guys just not get a lot of short ones  that's it   you know word sometimes you know people   who will uh who will trade their equipment in   and they'll go to a ah they'll go to ah a   second-hand store  mhh hmm   or some some some places they accept trade-ins whereby  okay   where the trade is basically you go and then you bring your old equipment in and they word   you get a discount   they evaluate it and then they knock the price off of their uh off of the skis that you're buying   right  ya   so they might have uh something a little bit more in your uh in your price range  and perhaps they might have a little bit more selection  hmm  i don't know   so does does the trading post have second-hand skis  uhm two words they do   a few words   s so   so it doesn't look like there's much in the second-hand department  no there's not too much  so   hmm   how are you fixed for credit   would you like to to perhaps or perhaps you'd like to look at some more skis  well i'd like to keep looking at the skis cos that's the main thing that i want to get  right   okay 
Canada	 okay  so on the fourteenth we have a staff meeting   yup   last week's meeting   i'll tell i'll fill you in a bit  we started talk talking   it was a maybe two words meeting right   as opposed to a team staff meeting  ya   so uhm gerald uh chaired and we were talking about protocol and fonction d'&eacute;quipe and stuff  anyway he was just saying commending us he says that it's since our last meeting it's been going very well you know between the two offices  that's nice he had something positive to say  ya  and then uhm but he said you know there's still a lack of communication between you know tori and i so that we have to work on  so we talked about like any problems and stuff  and amelie brought up the fact that when we sat down that friday to talk about the dossier   how good how interesting it was  ya ya   it was  ya  and i said you know  so i mentioned that the whole problem that we don't have time to evaluate cos we're always running  and i said and some of that has come from the fact that we don't have a lot of overtime accumulated anymore  we've been really good at taking time back and stuff   ya   so i said you know so now we we  push a f fifty sixty  hour work week which we used to work sixty hours and  accumulate all that time in thirty-five hours so obviously a lot of our time is now spent out of the office running around   ya   so he wrote all these things down  and so we started talking about december  he said he didn't reali realize  he didn't know that we were gonna   going to take december to evaluate which  which we mentioned a few months ago  ya  we've mentioned quite a few times  so  what do you think about that   he likes it  he really likes it  he thinks it might not be  well uh first he said two weeks is too much and we said are you kidding  like uh we think that that's going to be  a shame   if we have to sit down and do it we did it just for dossier femme and   that was part of dossier femme   there wasn't even a full one   mm hmm   you know   and so there's you know there's  a lot to talk about there's a lot to discuss  we wanna want to spend time in cleaning the offices and organize ourselves and stuff  i said you know two weeks should be okay   so he i no i noticed that he wrote down all the notes about uhm french and stuff   and and how maybe we uh you know it's very hard to say no and it's very hard to plan in your  in advance because we were talking about those things  mm hmm   how they're great but things come up  the n d g notre-dame-de-gr&acircumflex;ce rapist we didn't know was going to happen and a lot of our time this summer was devoted to that  ya  we didn't know we were gonna going to   be inundated with home security visits  no  so you know there's a fine line between planning planning and precisely and then   y you can't plan precisely for a year  no   that's our job to answer whatever the   community community's needs are  mm hmm   but it gives you a good base to find out you know what should be done when  ya   ya  but  so uhm we started talking about evaluating and i'm not sure how how to do this  should i sit down with every staff member and start the process  should i fill out a form  like should i make a form that you guys fill out on each project and put it together  do we sit down   well that's what amelie used to do right  mm hmm  she used to fill out a form  but i don't know if it should be as much as the whole team together on one project because not not  everybody's involved in every project  maybe the people involved  like we did amelie you and i for the uhh  the walks  ya   ya  because each one of us had a different view on things and oh ya this happened oh ya this happened   if we were a few words   at the end of the day it  it's still not put on paper word   no i don't know if she did or not  i haven't even  i started at the hospital but i never got a chance to  uh to finish it  ya   i have all my notes though  that's all   because i i wan   want   it's it's still it's it's still  very hard to put down on paper  ya i know i know  because where did it start and where does it finish is  ya  cos i i wanna want to  have written reports on the whole year  it's gonna going to be more  uh i mean if you want i could still do it on paper and it's going to be more like a graph at one point where which   communities did what and what's to come  the future outcome of it   ya   ya   okay i have   where's the word   because if we do if we take our activities  this isn't even it   exasperated breath   you know the database that i made   ya  i don't have the full one  you never gave me the full one  i gave you mine  okay   plus the board of directors want a report on what we've been doing  so sniff this is a   i think it would also be great for the uhm next year the end of the year i mean if we do this two words   so if i take  like autograph won't take a whole day but but  everyone should be able to evaluate it and what we wanna  want to do next year  like is it something we wanna want to  continue  you know do we wanna want to push  lacombe lamonde to have it on a regular basis  do we not  so we wanna want to try like you know  so if we go alphabetically   there's some things that well there's some things that   okay like autographs should everybody individually  i think autograph ya because everyone's supposed to know how to do it and everyone has done it now  ya   okay so that's an an example autograph everybody does it   uh let's say you do make up some some  type of form for activities that are like that anything you can think of and we write it down and then we get together and  compare notes and then that's when we evaluate the program as a whole  ya   ya  that's a good idea  and then banking security project well obviously that'll be you and jack sitting down  mm hmm   but i mean i i think that  everyone anyone can be invited you know what  i mean  like what if what if earl  has a great idea about banking security or what if he  oh ya   no i think everybody should do it  i'm not saying that we shouldn't get together  maybe like if  let's say we take those two weeks  ya  okay  let's take the first uhm four days to individually do our things  and then like let's say the bank thing it wouldn't be individually  ya   mm hmm   it would be me and jack   ya   but it's not including the whole gang  no  and then we bring it back to the whole  the whole gang and just decide is it worth it is it not uh what what should we do next year if we have to do it again and   ya   which means this form should be out to everyone soon  because i'd like to give you all a couple of weeks to look it through and think   mm hmm   well that's it cos you're not gonna going to  be able to do like all of our activities in four days   or three days  no   no  but this is a m   but i mean we should spend the  we should do this now and spend the last two weeks together evaluating them together  yup yup   well what would be some things that you'd want to tell  in the evaluating what would be some things that you would want   everyone to know let's say with autograph   you know what i mean  like the sheet'll say autograph   uhm  what i wanna want to do about it is go through the files and see how many sessions were done how many cars  were done throughout the year  that's for my that's for my end of   year   ya   uhm  the best part of it the worst part of it how much time was used to prepare  i don't know  i don't know what types of questions word    ya but and half of the  half the paper has to be just general comment  yup  uhm   okay   because autograph it's not something that we do just by ourselves  lacombe lamonde does all the publicity  ya  uhm it doesn't take as much time to prepare  right sniff   but when we get there and we see that the publicity hasn't been done right and you don't get any cards it's very frustrating so is it worth you know like what should what should we do at this point  ya   like new ideas  like they could be apart from new ideas  do we take this on ourselves  well now because earl and jack have been trained we can do it ourselves  like do next summer do we wanna  want to do the cars here in the parking lot  ya  do we wanna want to you know approach queen meredith hospital  ya  these type of things   yup   but okay so general comments   okay  and then each each activity will have a sheet   ya  i think you should ask marte for her  uhm the sheet that she got  she already  old evaluation  ya  it was kind of like uhm clicking noise  you know uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm   like the activity report right  i think so  i think so  but i don't think we need all that information  no  or maybe we do i don't know   but we already have it  that's what those uh those  one-page things are for to look back on  for me anyway  ya   i think it shouldn't be as detailed as that  no  should be more  maybe it should just be a blank sheet with autograph  what does one person think about it and then i don't know  that could be   and just in a box somewhere take into con  consideration uh pre  preparation uh the the day itself  just to give you ideas you know cos when you start you might forget a certain thing and if you see it there   preparation the day itself  what about strengths and weaknesses or you think everyone will know to put them in   no   put it put it in as a you know  strengths weaknesses   just to help you get started on it  ya   outcome   outcome   eventually too what i'd like to do is remember we had the uhm  you know the other office who did uh what all the activities are like  what you have to me what you need to prepare   mm hmm  eventually if this can go into a binder and then slowly as the year progresses  like what is autograph you know like  what what what do you need blah blah blah blah  ya   ya  like that would just take that would be a paragraph   so eventually if someone new comes in  you give them work two words  laugh   okay  well that would make sense  and then everyone gets a copy to fill out  ya   ya   then we sit down and we   on everything  uhm   i mean you don't even have to make a sheet with  autograph on it  just make blank sheets with with the uhm uhm just saying the title of it and then the few ideas what to consider and give each person a list of what they should be filling out   because the bank pamphlet  won't you know  ya   oh ya   ya 
Canada	 but they may have ideas  they may have ideas  so you write them all down and if they want to fill out something that can if they have any ideas at this point  okay   coughing fit   that'd be great   okay so i'm gonna going to   bring all this up monday morning   ya   okay   the word banking security pamphlet then b c manual then the meeting then the recognition party  then the tr   you see the b c manual has never been done in french   word jenny was working on it  blackmon-manning   ya  i know at one point she said she uh she   would  i didn't i didn't remember she was still doing it  well i'm glad  cos it's all there  the translations are all there  you just have to get it in the right font and the right pages  cough they've got it in italian eh cough   it's in italian  ya  who's doing it in italian   it's on the computer   rona did  rona did the block captain manual  did s she   oh no  soren okay   no soren's   ya  sorry   uh the block parent committee the block captain training and maintenance the bulletin the two words   animation c&circumflex;te de word ensemble  child identification sessions  we're gonna going to have to go over these one more time   that's what we'll do monday cos i'm sure there's stuff missing  well we should take the list that i made at the beginning of the year and compare it with that  yup i have that   uhm i'm sure we're gonna going to   come up with things that we hadn't thought of   yup   that's right  liquid paper's getting thick   okay  so you like that idea  yup  it gives everyone a chance to prepare because i don't wanna want to go there i don't  wanna want to spend the last two weeks  not knowing what to talk about  ya  you have to prepare  ya  okay so something like this  this liquid paper is finished  there's more in the other   i mean it's very liquid but the brush is  disgusting  sniff   because we really have to plan priorities for next winter  i wanna want to do something  i would like to do something big next year maybe during national crime prevention week which will be in june  ya but whatever happened to the mega- project    mm hmm   this is true  but uh if camden's future's on the line   it's ah up to us to prove uh   i know   what we can do  ya  we know what we're doing   so anyway   uhm jorge called s uh gerald  and asked why we're not doing more for national crime prevention week   what did he say  i don't know what he said but i i  gave gerald an earful  i said the whole year's been like a national crime prevention year  i said give us a break  he agreed   we were talking about jorge's politics and   i'm getting tired of you know  ya   i know   like the comit&eacute; des gens   but uh sniff i guess we'll see from there  well go f on   exhale so what else to you ha  have   okay   didn't you say uh didn't like jorge  say at the beginning of the year don't put too much emphasis  on on national crime prevention week this year cos it's gonna going to change  i thought similar   i don't know what his problem is  so it's in june and we'll have to   well in december we'll figure out what we want to do  is it gonna going to to be all geared towards youth   you heard raj on sunday   i i   i heard him  i know amelie's really big on that and yes but that doesn't help the people who are living now   eventually yes in the future if you give kids what they need they'll be okay but that doesn't help our senior population  the thing is with kids uh i mean it's not uhm a one time thing  no  it's not like when we do information sessions with  uh with adults where if you explain something to them and they pretty much get the drift  mm hmm  with kids you have to repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat  look at mary-beth anderson's school  if i went back half of them wouldn't remember what i said  ya  you know  and it's more than that too  it's not just someone talking to them  it's making sure they're fed properly in the morning so they can go to school and learn instead of being hungry  and you know dropping out of school cos they're not concentrating so they don't do well   ya   ya but what they're talking about youth things they're not just talking about sessions  they're talking about plays and  ya  sigh   well it looks nice very nice  thanks   so   i mean we could do it but it's an awful lot of energy  why don't we get uhm stagiaires   or something students to do it  students   if we got a student uhm grant for the summer   or even one of those uhh projects that we had where we had the  darius and uh  and have them work strictly on working out a play  mm hmm   mm hmm   like anne-marie did  ya because we  look at us  we we don't have the time   unless we drop everything we're doing  nope   ya  and people this community won't let us  nope   could you imagine if they were talk  talking   you know who would be our biggest supporter if there was even a movement to get rid of camden would be john   you think so   karen can't say anything now can she  she wouldn't have been able to say anything then  she was with she was with  the n t n   the opposition   ya  john's opposition  ya  front page of the monitor he said he was gonna   going to   no not front page but in the monitor this week did you see what it said  no i haven't read it  i'll get it speaker gets up and moves away; rustling sound   uhh page two  quotation   which is true  ya   so   but you know how much political stirring that would  even saint declan's and easthaven the letters they could write and   i know   edison and all that stuff  i'm i'm not worried  all our block captains   mm hmm  and their members  mm mm mm yup   okay let's talk about this block captain meeting in december  which is only like three weeks away   i know  next week i have to do my mailing  is it the next week or the week after that i put it down  i put it down for the twenty-first   it's like   okay   uhm that's only two weeks before   it's just that i couldn't   if i can i'll do it next week  but will they forget though  well that's what i'm i'm worried about  two weeks   giving them two weeks is  but it's also a potluck so they have to call anna   ya   so anna's looking after this  anna's looking after this  uhm i have the thing that she gave me uhm that about what she what she needs and all that and her  phone number is  on it   oh she word   okay   so i'm not doing any of it  okay  this is her idea  this is what she wants to do  uhm so i'm not getting involved in it  do we need uh  i guess we need supplies  ya what we'll need is plates forks knives   and with someone like let's say alain  who maybe you know doesn't cook doesn't wanna want to   cook maybe he can bring fifty plates  ya   but we have plastic plates downstairs  ya   i liked it with   i did the same thing for w   for saint declan's   i have to get  i mean i mean i'm gonna   going to get all the forks and plates and stuff like that  for them  what about christmas and chanukah napkins  i think we should take out our little christmas tree put it right in the middle of the table  yup  because we have more uh  our jewish uh block captains are growing  yup  ivan goldenberg   ya  and it's nice to you know   i don't know if we have any muslim   uh well we have uh nur al din mu   muslim or not   yes i believe he's muslim   are we inviting those people   are we inviting saint declan's and  easthaven   no   no  block captains only  block captains  i know at saint declan's we're having our own  ya  i don't know what easthaven's doing but   ya   okay so anna's handling all of this   ya   so we're basically just gonna going to  plan a regular meeting except shorter  yup   yup  and then it's uhh   what night is it  it's on a wednesday the seventh  whistling   december   aw shh  two words two thousand   okay so december seventh wednesday   i think you're invited to ours on uhm the day before   if you want   oh ya   ya  in east to uh saint declan's    i keep saying easthaven   is it a potluck again   ya  everybody's going to bring something  okay   uhm but anna's going to call me and see  cos i told her i said i'll bring whatever's needed at the end you know  ya   and it's a gift exchange  but you buy a gift five dollars male or female no name on it   but whoever shows up has to bring a gift  okay  so michael got into it  oh michael god  michael   oh i'll make this  i'll make that  okay i'm making the cake  okay i'll i'll i know i have to make my mousse too  word   and people find he's so  when you first meet him he's very you know   cold  ya  ya  he looks it  ya  but he's not   he sounds it too  oh no no  not at all  cos he's a big pussycat   he's ser he's serious   in his job  oh ya  that's the thing you know and we need that   oh uh i mean look if you had someone like marjorie  sitting on saint declan's   oh god  laugh   i mean he he commands that type he commands that type of attention  word think about it   yup  but he is a big pussycat   he scared me the first time i met him  laugh   i said no   cos i was going from working with women which are   which is really different you know  ya  and i met him i thought oh no   dana i think said oh he's kinda kind of  cute  laugh   well and look what happened  okay so i'll make something too  can you tell me  okay so for the block captain then just to call anna  tell her what i will be making  yup  i'm going to look through my cookbooks this weekend   i'm learning how to plan ahead   another one of my problems   exhale okay so call anna for  i learnt that in high school  we had no choice   we had to make our own agenda  sniff   there was a deadline to put in certain reports but there was different steps to give in   and we had to make our own agenda say when we were giving it in  if we didn't we lost points  hm   my stomach's rumbling  hungry  no not especially  i am  i didn't have breakfast  okay so what else here now   i'm just looking at your stuff sniff   oh you have a black you have an animator's meeting   yes  and did i fill in  i have to leave from twelve to two so i'm gonna  going to bring my own car to the thing  okay  two words reason i'm probably going to leave from home and go directly there  it's just as uh quick for me  uhm   i was supposed to do the lawn circle  okay   three words   you've got a few words eh   word   ya i know  why are we the front uh on the front line   again   i don't know  cos we're the only office that knows how to do this thing   we're the only office that camden didn't do it   because it seems that when the city did it there were all these problems   and the city didn't do it  we did it   and like amelie said meagan spitzer's been one of our biggest supporters  she loved the way it was done   you know as opposed to the city where jean michelle  she liked the way   shaka too though  she's no longer there  ya  shaka   because shaka told uh uhm i think it was  jorge said well i'm using the n d g notre-dame-de-gr&acircumflex;ce  laugh word 
Canada	 no i'm  i i i i have a problem with seriously limiting to towards either sex or age or anything  anyone can use this  ya  and and   but it doesn't say seniors   seniors on it   ya   and nor should it  no   anyone  even let's say a twelve year old girl a thirteen year old girl who's just starting to bank   yup  you know uh babysitting and opened up her own account and  you know   yup you're right  oh news eh pulse tonight six o'clock mike i think  the jen hawes thing   oh ya  ya   they called him up  no but they've had uhm  it's a three part special on women's safety and they had two parts already   that's good  so it should be on tonight  he probably forgot sniff   call him up later  word   cough   so well that's good  that's not a lot  and maricourt isn't far sniff   no it isn't   it's just the other way  ya  it's right off the highway  that's what i like about it   seems we often go there for meetings  people are not happy about this christmas vacation eh  who  amelie and paul   why  very angry  cos they don't get a full two weeks  yup  they get nine days instead of ten   rian atoul told me  she said uh oh you know we got ten days last week  last year sniff and said you know if you speak to  gerald it doesn't you know   ya but where's  i don't know  i i never even looked at it  i'm coming in with mike here because this is john's  birthday so uhm   and and i'm not  coming in on the thrid cos it's my birthday  i   i don't know what the big deal is   that's right   but you can't finish here   i think it it's   word   that's what i was saying at the meeting  not if this office is op  open not if the whole building is open   that's what i was saying at the meet  meeting   did you find out when the when the   uh city closes  cough   no   but head office now i think they're closed here and here type thing  not a lot  i mean someone's upstairs   i mean they should close right after  they don't open as soon   no  that's the thing  last summer it was uh   cos the second is a holiday  remember last year what we did is we took   we stayed in the office two days after  c&ocircumflex;te-des-neiges montreal neighbourhood had left  because we had to take two days coming back  mm hmm   but i don't see what the problem is cos you get the  i i'll get this day back  ya   one two three four five six seven eight nine ten  no  one two three four five six seven eight nine  the the second is closed eh  ya  big deal  and you're taking the third   so i'm gonna going to  word in here   you know what i'm gonna going to be doing  mm hmm  nobody's gonna going to be working working  no  you just tend the office  that's it   so what's the big deal  i mean john and mike are coming  you think they're going to be working  no  they'll be playing the computer   they're going to be playing on the computer  i'll probably be cleaning laugh if it's not already done  ya   ya  it's a pain to do all that  but it's just to answer the phones  that's all  i know  that's  you know check the mail  i know   mail still runs   head office closes here  so word   oh   amelie asked of course cos mel  showed up at ashland and one of the first questions out of her mouth was when do you finish for uh christmas  he said twenty-second  she said oh   so  but uh they  see the thing is they live for their holidays  i know   uhm i mean i feel bad for them  yes  it's terrible to live your life between vacations  yes  but sometimes people gotta got to  work  gerald actually has put his foot down on this issue too  cos i guess he's uh realizing that   so who's attending the office there  uhm jacqueline   oh i have it here   okay twenty-first it's amelie but i think jackie  is going in too with her   ya cos they have to be two  ya but they said it wasn't working out that way  but anyway sniff   jacqueline is gonna going to  go in with amelie on the twenty-first  and then you and mike here   twenty-second jacqueline is gonna going to be all by herself so i might go in there   john and mike here  and the third gerald and ja   jack gerald and jack     and rian and i here the third  cos jack will be in richmond too  and and i mean i'll probably stop in anyway   yup  when you're two minutes away it's really no big deal   so   you can do like last year   clear off your desk and make sure that there's enough room to pile some more on it   laugh that's right  that's what i did last year  laugh you came in last year over the christmas holidays  do you remember   ya  you were here almost every day  i didn't want to be home  i know  so this year is a little different  ya  i like to lead and i'm gonna   going to decorate my house for christmas   it's gonna going to be a hard christmas for you guys  i know   i might just wanna want to  decorate  but you're at home blessing and that's   ferlix   i know   a lot of people don't decorate you know the first year  we need at least a christmas tree  i'm not  oh i mean   ya   the thing is the   if you're all adults maybe but you have   a a little guy   ya but it was my dad's joy to put the lights outside and to have it out  you know he left the lights on all night christmas day and you know  like it was something that he really enjoyed  ya   it's gonna going to be hard because he used to sit down and be like the santa claus get out the gifts and  one by one  hm   that's what jim was thinking about doing  i said well   then you gotta got to do it for him   ya  that's exactly it  i know   traditions have to continue   then you got a little guy who's probably waiting for santa claus as we speak  oh ya   commercials are starting   ya well did you go into the store lately  no  it's all decorated word   as soon as halloween is over   it's too early  as soon as halloween's over well christmas decorations go up   word   so i guess he's making his list and checking it twice  yup  i already bought him something  did you  ya  the monster food factory  laugh mmm  they eat uhm monster skin and all that  oh pleasant   you make you make uh you make stuff and you eat it  lovely   it looks really disgusting  mm hmm  that's what he wanted   so we don't have a lot in december right  i mean we'll try not to schedule anything  well   unless it's an emergency   listen my only problem is that when i start off a month it's usually blank or i get like the first weeks filled out and it fills out as i go  ya  i'm going to have to be vigilant with myself and say no  no is no you know   ya   now thing is mike has to be like that too because mike will book me everywhere  we all do   i mean it doesn't  i'll tell you now about the block captain meeting  uh   it doesn't matter  things can wait til until january  people aren't in that much of a hurry  i hope  and saint declan's is the sixth they said  ya   and then if a few words that's okay  ya   i don't know why  oh shoot   sniff   i just ruined this  why amelie and john are so uhm upset about the holidays  all they have to do is accumulate seven hours and take their ten days  yup   it's not a word   i mean that last week when we're coming in for those three days  you think we're going to be working working  exactly  one half a day's gone  we're going to the restaurant  yup   i'm going to be doing my regular cleaning or   sniff but if we want to paint the office we have to put some time aside   if we hopefully if we can get all that done maybe we can take the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth and clean  what do you think   i think that would be a great good idea  kay okay   we really have to start uhm on the fifth  ya  and nothing word booked   word that week word  sniff   i mean if you book anything you book it at night and a few words   are we going to empty the offices   i think we should just for uhm the uhm phones and  word   then again unless she has not uhm   amelie won't be sitting on these  she could uh   or they can transfer calls  we could transfer   i mean we could be based out of the other office  i don't care  yup   okay fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth of december cleaning   cleaning and painting  ya   sounds good   cough   so the week of the fifth to the tenth is evaluation   what about the s nineteenth twentieth meetings  nineteen and twen twentieth   uhm the twentieth is a write off  the twentieth well we're gonna going to  be coming in and finishing up whatever our hours our kilometres our end of month  ya   it's probably going to be a lot of end of month  ya  but there won't be much  no   on the nineteenth we're probably going to be  be putting back furniture  ya   so   so that just cut down our evaluation in one week  one week and  no   no  but   well then we could start on the first which is the thursday friday   well we have the twelfth and the thirteenth too   there's always word  weeks   ya   and what if we're not finished   the sixteenth or the evaluation  no the evaluation   we have to be   we cos we could let that drag on forever  we really have to put an opening time and a closing time  what if we tell them though that we're painting the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth  they wanna want to clean too   okay so put three days for cleaning  that that might  well he can't say anything for us  we're painting his office  we gotta got to find colours though  ya cough   we gotta got to find uh   we should uh start keeping uh newspapers   it's uhh almost twelve  still rolling  is it  ya   so   what time did we start our meeting at  i have no idea  oh  she'll come in  laugh sniff   we left her two hours i said   laugh   so that's what you think an evaluation form   yup  with just notes on it what to consider in it because some  some people might write uh a page and a half on the   outcome and only uh a quarter of a page on uh  on something else you know  mm   because this takes time   ya   you have to sit down and think and write it out  that's it  that's why i won't   monday and tuesday the  bell starts tolling thursday and friday the first that's what i'm gonna going to do  i'm putting everything inside and that's what i'm gonna  going to do  okay   i i mean i i'm gonna going to i'm gonna   going to start them as soon as i have them   but i'm gonna going to finalize them all then   ya   ya you have to make sure that mike stays with the schedule  he has to   let's hope he doesn't have anything   oh   if he does he doesn't know about them at this point   so so preparation a couple lines for that  what would you write for preparation for autograph   uhm everything that you need  like i mean what would what would you   consider as preparation  let's do autograph you know quickly  uh okay are we holding it or are  are we holding it by our self  at this point with lacombe lamonde   first thing is to contact lacombe lamonde   to set up a date  two word   uhm ask him/-> well we usually ask him  where are they gonna going to publicize  maybe three words   mm hmm  then you call them back tell them which date you're having it  bell tolling continues 
Canada	 uhm  and and if you look at it and say well you know i think well then we just add in this sentence here or these two sentences here and it's basically  it's it's it's not that much of a change  then then we could we could   bring up the point that night  hmm   if it's not the point then uh then uh   uhm you know an extended  ah what i'll do too is i'm going to call the woman who was the president of our board of directors of our daycare  was w stepping down as president at the time uh that our relocation came came through  mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm  and so we asked her to stay on as the chairperson of our relocation committee  mm hmm  because she was the person who actually   she was the the the founding f  mother of the daycare  mm hmm  and so she knew a lot of the ins and outs of what regulations were required uh building codes for example   for daycare  mm hmm   i didn't realize that certain windows have to be a certain size and and that you can't have a daycare in a room where there are no windows and you can't have it in the basement unless windows are so large and  uhm uh bathroom facilities have to be within so many feet  and that kind of thing   mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm   and she was aware of all of those things so we asked her to stay on because it was she just had the knowledge that none of us had and would take us far too long and probably we would've made quite a few mistakes along the way had we not asked her to stay on   sure yeah   mm hmm mm hmm   uhm and what i think i'll do is i'll probably give her a call and uhm perhaps she might remember th  more about the relocation than than   i did rather than do our own things and uh   so what i remember about it and how we handled certain situations  uhm might be uhm embellished by the conversation with her  mm hmm   excellent excellent   mm hmm   or in fact it there could be that there was a meeting held and i wasn't able to go or something and so we may have i i might be missing a very key point  mm hmm  so i'll speak with her to to uhm to  refresh my memory because what i would like to do  is is perhaps provide a little bit of background information for the committee  excellent   cos the committee getting it cold might think well gee  why do we have to advise the community that we're moving in uhm and uh i think if they were a little sensitive to the fact that here were only thirty little babies wanting to move into a building and a whole community became very upset  mm hmm  uh certainly uhm m your child being displaced for another school would upset a community  to a to a great degree and so we have to really think about that  oh yeah   sure   excellent point  so all of those things to to  sensitize them to the issue at the time that we present the change   so they understand the need for the addition to uh  to the letter  mm hmm   that would also help the the tenor of the letter that i was talking about because it gives a very strong message to the board that we are we are trying to take this   we are trying to look at the larger picture as well  mm hmm mm hmm   that sends the right message   it's not just our school but the community that we serve and the community that we are relocated to  mm hmm   okay  alright   i can't believe i asked myself for more work  well no but this is this is  exactly the type of work that that you would you would excel at and really uhm   well i found every time that a document has gone out this year sending it out uhm to people like yourself has made it a better document  every single time  but in some cases th they  it's good to have a lot of opinion on   on uhm especially something that's going to the board uhm because i think you can't you you really if you're representing the community then it has to be a community effort  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  uh i guess that's why i i  really wanted people to comment on the sexual harassment policy  because i wanted it to be a community thing  i know yeah   i didn't want it to be a one thing  and and yet uhm i suppose  it's a difficult issue for a lot of people to deal with uhm  and and they may not have had the opportunity to encounter those kinds of issues in their day to day work life in terms of policy setting issues   mm hmm   and so uhm uh i uh it i'm  glad that i was able to help uhm   it's only unfortunate that other people uhm  couldn't have shared in the experience or maybe they could have used that to take to their workplace and insist that they had a policy  in place in their workplace  it would've been and i think the lack of response to my gut feeling was the lack of response was   that they felt very comfortable with what  what was said and if if they read it and i think that i think that   most if not everybody read it read it  thoroughly  mm hmm   but i think that there was almost a feeling that it was fairly there was something almost intimidating about it   do you know what i mean about the whole idea of it and the whole uhm process  that it might have been intimidating for people to  to read it and comment on it   they look down on it   yes it uh it it's something   it's it's something that they might have felt was a little over their head  hmm   right  it to tell you the truth uhm   that was that was uhm part of my  feeling  i read it and   two or three words too   laugh   yes well it was but but   you well first of all you you   took it on and then you also used not just your expertise but other people's expertise  mm hmm  and so that was that gave you uh uh confidence  mm hmm  whereas you know a a mother or a father at the school reading this it's a pretty heavy thing and  and to make it to formally go up to someone who's written something and and  make a comment you wanna want to feel   comfortable with the subject matter   yes yes laugh   it ain't word or two laugh    the subject matter isn't exact  isn't a comfortable topic either  so i i would take it as i would take it as  just a vote of confidence  mm hmm   i really uhm i really  thought that that was exactly what it was  mm hmm mm hmm  it's just as as i said uhm when you're representing a community you want to feel as if something has been a community effort  mm hmm  and there's a sense of the well being when something's for  the community after all   mm hmm   you you feel that you've accomplished something when it's been done for the community as a whole  uhm and and with the community  yeah   so uhm i i i i guess for that reason that's why i sort of felt that there was a certain degree of emptiness in my in my handing over the document to the uh to the board but uhm  well another another   time another another topic and i think we'll get  word or two   i pick difficult topics you know  laugh   yeah well   this is this isn't a difficult   one   this isn't a difficult one because   this goes to it's a pretty primary it   it deals with with relocation   yeah   mm hmm   that's laugh that's  gonna going to hit all our children  and there are some very e very everyday   aspects to it that hit everybody's lives  word   i know i can pick apart the the   the real feeling word   i find that very often you can   you can not attack but you can get away with a lot more uhm when you're dealing with people about their issues but when you're dealing with them about their children's issues they get really  assertive laugh   mm hmm mm hmm that's right   it it becomes a different kettle of fish very quickly  i noticed at the meeting uh the volunteers' luncheon  that uhm that was held when uh there was discussion about the relocation of the school  and an invitation to uh the parents that were there to come  and participate in uh the next uh uh school committee meeting  mm hmm   mm hmm   hmm   i noticed keen interest from people that i had never seen before  oh   excellent   they wanted to know the date and the time and  where it was gonna going to be held   excellent excellent   so i i would imagine that you're going to have uhm a somewhat of a larger turn-out than you what you would normally have  at least i would hope  mm hmm  uhm is there   oh excuse me it's also in the uhm  it's also gone out with a little blurb in with our  school committee  in fact it was the first point of the school  committee highlights to say you may have read about the uhm  leedsman school board uhm uh resolution or whatever it was  to to change uh to to change the language of instruction uhm of some schools in the leedsman school board enclosure  okay   and we uhm i can't remember how i put this or something but we may be affect uhm if affected   if affected uhm we would like to be heavily involved  your school committee is already in getting uhm setting up a meeting on this issue and uhm we want to be sure uh if we are affected that we are part of the process and that we uhm are aware of the new facility we are moving into and there will be a meeting of the school committee on the twelfth of june  all e p p parents are invited to come  and the reason for that was school-wide we wanted to plant that end of sentence tape ends   the purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the uh   hammerstein judgement  i would like nothing better than to discuss this judgement with you adelaide   oh right weren't you a member of the winning party  yes in fact i was the junior attorney on the forum  that must be quite exciting and i hear this was an action for approximately seven million dollars in damages in a medical liability suit  yes it was   that's right it was and it was a very uh long and uh contentious process to bring to trial  and as you know we encountered some difficulty in uh dealing with all the various issues that arose in this trial including uh having to uh secure the uh presence of certain witnesses  at any rate   well   i guess the first order of business is to review the facts as set out in uh luke gerard's judgement in pages  six to fifty approximately  so it's very factored in the judgement which we're very pleased with because it leaves very little room for appeal since only legal issues can be appealed  although i think uh i don't know if   you've you've uh sort of digested i don't even think i have but i am wondering whether or not on the fault issue itself there may be an opening for an appeal  hmm   uh although he makes a determination with respect to the facts surrounding the fault issue uhm   i think perhaps creative treatment of how he deals with it might lead to an appeal  well i think it's his only option for an appeal is to dig up that question of fault and uh examine it dissect it  extraodinarily thoroughly in the hopes that his appeal can succeed on that point because as for the determination of the facts themselves i don't think that there really is much room left for any other interpretation beyond that which judge gerard gave it  yeah   yeah  it's interesting eh because we were so worried during the trial about whether or not all the points we were trying to make would actually translate into the judgement  and to a large part uhm he s the judge seems to have really listened to and review it in detail the transcripts that we submitted on all the fact issues uhm  although uh there are some things which are still unclear but one of the points that he does make is that we are attempting to  determine in terms of the uh the timing issues  uh a very short period of time with approximate estimates of  what happened  yeah   uhm 
Canada	 morrison takes a look  they feed out front but the bears get to it  and here's esposito on the left wing for thompson  in across the line  thompson trying to cut in on goal  thompson centring out front  it bounces to dawkins   and he'll hold on with five fifty-one to go in the first and the dinosaurs in front of golden bears one nothing  thompson driving wide and tried to centre  we'll hear from mike thompson during our first intermission  and he keeps his wheels once again but he's going against a ah all-canadian defenseman last year jamie pegg  and uh pegg just ke kept  him to the outside  turned with him  thompson uh was able to keep the puck but he wouldn't   couldn't get to the net couldn't drive right in front of dawkins there  the cow bell an added feature to our broadcast tonight  laugh   one of the fans here with a a  noise-making apparatus  they also have a little noise across the ice   that's the band from the university of calgary   puck goes in behind the net  aaron zarowny checked by ruark  ruark comes up with it and he'll move it ahead for the dinosaurs  off the glass and into the crowd  the glass here's very short along the side and uh doesn't take much for the puck to clear it   and a pretty good crowd tonight in calgary  uh a few more people than yesterday  the one side's packed and i think there's uh a pretty good section of golden bears supporters to our left uh uh just left of the bear's bench tonight   five thirty-eight left in the first   one nothing dinosaurs in front of the golden bears as aaron zarowny prepares to face off against todd johnson   dinosaurs have it off the draw  krywulak clearing out to centre  it's knocked down by hjertaas  ahead to aaron zarowny and he taps it back to trevor sherben   now on the left side it's tapped in across the goal   l line uh across the blue line   simpson has it for alberta  turning trying to get away from couldwell but calgary will march it out to centre ice  johnson getting rid of it  now it's cleared back ahead for colin zarowny  trying to work away from masters   he's taken out by johnson  and johnson sends it all the way down the ice  this should go as icing as hjertaas goes back after it   and icing indeed the call against the dinosaurs who were about to make a line change and so krywulak rather than knock that thing down let it go and now we'll have a faceoff deep in calgary territory  once again the effort there for the bears but the lot  uh they're not really g uh  getting a lot done  no really ah good chances on dawkins the whole game tonight i don't think   no none   there's a couple fluttering shots towards him but he'll stop those  a couple long ones but uh  if they think they're gonna going to get  laugh a long one like frank got last night uh they're dreaming  i don't think dawkins will let another ugly one in like that for awhile  jickling prepared to faceoff against flint to the glove-hand side of dawkins   five oh four left in the first   and the linesman won't toss it in there   waving jickling outta out of there  twice tonight jickling's got tossed out of the face off  uh uhm we got esposito up there as well on this one though  we saw a lot of that last night   esposito to faceoff against flint  esposito kicks it back to haney  haney snapping it toward the goal but that was blocked by townsend  and the dinosaurs have it  here's marlborough whistling it out to centre ice  hard pass for townsend  off his stick into the bear bench  coach daum uh really shuffling the lines up here  it's a combination we haven't seen before jickling esposito and haney  and uh two good faceoff men in in  the deep zone but uh coach daum's kept em them  up for the entire shift  and uh inters interesting  to see  you gotta have got to do something to switch it up and try and uh create some offense   jickling will faceoff against townsend at centre   one nothing dinosaurs in front here in calgary  esposito picks up the puck off the draw and dumps it deep into his own zone   back to pick it up is pullishy  up the wall the bears clear the zone  marble trying to send it back in  gave it away  and here goes haney down the wing  haney ahead for esposito   esposito moves in and jickling is called offside on the right wing  tried to drag the back skate   and looked like a very close play there but the draw's  comin' coming with four thirty-seven left in period number one   and we should mention evan this last week uh the award winners for canada west were handed out and uh brian purdy of the saskatchewan husky not 'huskies' who i never got the opportunity to see play  you might have seen him in the western league  but he was named the canada west m v p and the sullivan award winner senator a. joseph sullivan trophy: outstanding player for this season  he played in nipawin of the s j h l saskatchewan junior hockey league and also uh brandon of the western league so i did get a chance to see purdy play  oh okay   he's supposed to be quite the player  fantastic fantastic hockey player  and uh he was uh about it for saskatchewan   laugh really   ya laugh   i bet   here's haney across the line  his shot a pad save  jickling get to the rebound  takes it behind the net  marble's on him  eremenko back to help out   they freeze it back there but eremenko will dig it out of the traffic and he'll flip it out to centre ice  pullishy with it at his own blue line  plays it over to goodkey   goodkey marches that puck to centre  goodkey'll flip it in wide of the dinosaur net   thompson out there forechecking against zulyniak  throws zulyniak off the puck  degner in to follow out   he's trying to get around zulyniak but zulyniak able to clear up the wing to murray  murray takes a look  boy is that cow bell ever making me mad   they dump it in across the line and degner  pardon me  that's tiltgen  it's got me confused too  tiltgen at centre   up on the left side  penalty coming up as pegg touches it   and the referee is sending stephenson to the penalty box for slashing  his second straight penalty and so we will see the bears on the power play for the second time tonight  and mike thompson doing the job irritating these dinos  he he drew two penalties last night  and drew another penalty tonight  and now the whole dino squad's chasin'   chasing him all over the ice and all he's doing is  chirpin' chasing at em them   and he's doing the job   and the bears gotta have got to  have a better power play this time  the last the first power play tonight was ah ahh very bad very ugly   hittin' hitting  ugly that one but they'll try to draw even as they go to work on their second power play here  stephenson for slashing at sixteen twenty-six   we gotta have got to do something about that guy with the bell  laugh go pay somebody to take him out  well maybe we'll work on that during the intermission   puck fired down the ice by the dinosaurs and back to pick it up is trevor sherben   sherben takes a look  he's a bears supporter though i think  that's the that's the good part the bell guy  tiltgen in there forechecking for it  schonek comes up with it  gets it around the boards  sherben has it on the right point  he'll move in  lets the blast go  that's blocked by couldwell   that shook him up a bit  bears clear to the corner  thompson has it   couldwell still down  now he gets up  degner behind the net  to tiltgen  back to degner  trying to work it back to tiltgen   tiltgen has it in the right corner  feeds it behind the net for thompson  out front  here's   trevor sherben moves in  lets the shot go  and he cranks it wide   bears have it  tiltgen in the corner now   they pass to the point  over the stick of jickling  they had the dinosaurs running big time   and bears move it in across the line  another penalty coming up against calgary   and i'm not sure what this one's gonna going to  be but the bears are gonna going to get a two-man advantage now   but hold on here   i think degner mighta might have got a slashing penalty and that's gonna going to hurt the bears  johnson is going over to talk to referee dave shaw  calgary was getting the original penalty and then i think degner drew an even-up call and so the bears stay on the power play   they have both gates open over at the penalty bench  pegg is going off for calgary  and pegg uh stick his knee out when jickling was making a move at the blue line on him and uh jickling drew a penalty but terry degner he didn't really do anything too drastic uh but lovsin came over and whacked him and degner whacked him back with a slash and uh the referee decided to even that up  and uh uhh bit of a bad play by degner there cos he should just go  two-man advantage there for a minute the bears would have had so that one hurts a little bit  these penalties at seventeen twenty-four   one nothing dinosaurs in front   degner two minutes for cross-checking   pegg two minutes for slashing  i think degner was mad because as he came across the blue line he got dumped right at the blue line   the bears might have had a two-on-one   he got dumped and uh went after the dinosaur player  i don't know if he knew there was a penalty coming up  a minute and two seconds uhh still left in the bears power play though   bears with it off the faceoff  ruark gets to it for calgary and he'll send it down the ice   back to get after it is krywko  five on four five skaters on four skaters power play as the bears work it at center  aaron zarowny flips it in wide of the net  bounces off the boards  ruark back to pick it up   over to marble  marble back to ruark  he'll clear it   and he sends it ahead  here's a breakaway pass for lovsin  outta out of his reach  and lovsin will try to set up morrison  gets it over to morrison however the pass slightly behind him  bears have it  here's jickling in across the line  trying to cut around ruark   lovsin took it out  haney to the line now  drop pass  bears a little fortunate there  here's a shot by esposito  puck rolls toward the net  haney kicks it into the corner   ruark bumping with aaron zarowny  haney has it  takes a hit from marble   bears after that thing  they get it up the wall  jickling lost it  lovsin able to chip it out to centre ice   that's it for the power play  bears  esposito will move it  in across the line here's colin zarowny moving in  he shoots  save by dawkins  real nice heads-up play by frank esposito to see zarowny coming off the bench and hitting him in uh full speed  uh colin had a good chance but uh didn't get much on the shot  similar to the pass that esposito tipped over to strand on the game winner in overtime last sunday night  very similar  frank's not the best skater in the world and even on this big ice surface though he still looks good cos he's using his head and he's making the the the smart plays  golden bears trail by a goal here with a minute twenty-seven left in the first period  todd johnson on the power play at the four thirteen mark  of this opening frame 
Canada	 a two-man advantage for calgary and johnson got credit for the goal   simpson to face off   simpson ready to face off against johnson  there's some kind of uh material at centre ice or something  a few words   a couple dinosaurs are hollering for the linesman to go get it   just some broken ice  laugh   just a bunch of broken ice   well a bit of a snow pack   here's haven off the draw  todd johns johnson   thompson the shot   and the save by dawkins  a nice draw win by simpson and thompson in the slot didn't get a whole lot of wood on it and dawkins down quickly  he goes down a lot  and there's a lot of rebounds tonight  the bears have got to get  after that initial shot somebody's got to get to that net cos there's some uh uh open net goals sitting there for em them    calgary has some decent-sized defencemen   ruark six three   he's one of their bigger boys  dinosaurs lose it off the draw  here's simpson in the slot  poking into the corner  thompson feeds it off to colin zarowny   they battle in there and schonek comes up with it  schonek will take it behind the net   marlborough tying up simpson who was trying to forecheck for it  flint gets to the line  his shot sails wide of the net   and thompson there to knife it ahead  colin zarowny  last minute in the period  ahead to simpson  simpson will dump it in  goes deep to the corner  after it there is colin zarowny  drops it off for simpson  now thompson left circle with the shot  that one off a skate wide of the net   dinosaurs' couldwell being checked  bears trying to come up with it  two guys went after it and the puck had come free   and the dinosaurs are able to clear   goodkey now  he lost it  here's a chance for krywulak  it's poked away by masson   johnson trying to work it up the boards  drops it off for krywulak  there's a man open in front   pass doesn't get through  back to the point now  masters right side for marlborough  out front for johnson  johnson shot  he hammered one over top the net  off the glass it went up the boards  bears in trouble in their own end as krywulak comes in with high hit on jickling   bears flip it high in the air and out to centre ice  ten seconds to go in the period  ziliniak will send it back in  pullishy back to play it  five seconds to go  that should do it for the period as pullishy dumps it up the open wing  and the buzzer sounds to end period number one  bears in big trouble in that last minute of play in their own end  and the difference between this weekend and last weekend we could just see in that last shift uh couldwell made a bad play going back in his own end  simpson took it out  the puck's sittin sitting there for colin zarowny  instead of taking it and looking for the man like he would have done last week he decided to hit couldwell again and the dinos got the puck  and uh uh they're just not playing it as smart as they did  last weekend   kevin schmalz who didn't see one second of ice time in that period went out and dumped the bears' uh jickling i believe it was after the players are milling about  word   so he's out there to stretch his legs and he laugh  is out there doing it to one of the bears' top players   i guess a smart move from calgary's standpoint but uh i mean if they're going to mess with you why don't they send one of their gunners out there to mess with one of your gunners   ya i don't know ev   it's chess game here  who knows  who knows the reasons these things happen   the goal scoring in that period todd johnson on the powerplay at four thirteen  couldwell and krywulak with assists  it was a two-man advantage a five-on-three powerplay and that was the only goal of the period  the shots on goal in that period we'll get for you in just a moment  the shots for calgary nine and for alberta six  so we thank the people here for that information   so for calgary nine  alberta six   one nothing the score  jeff two powerplays for both teams and the difference i think was clearly that five-on-three advantage that calgary got  bears woulda would have had one too if terry degner hadn'ta hadn't have taken that penalty  ya i mean the the ref did even things up there and w and the bears would have had a minute oh two with the five-on-three which is a   a great opportunity and uh deigs is probably a little bit upset at himself right now  let's take a time-out come back and hear from mike thompson in our first intermission  it's the calgary dinosaurs one the alberta golden bears no score in canada west university playoff hockey action  game two of this best of three division final from the clare drake arena in calgary on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight  commercials, interviews, and analysis in the intermission, 13 min 20 sec   and so the second period moments away here  masson leads the bears out  dawkins leads calgary out   and really if you recap that first like we've tried to do here dawkins was not forced to make a lot of saves  only six and maybe one real nice one and that was off mike thompson   and uh thompson didn't get great wood on it  but it was right off a faceoff win by ken simpson and thompson  corralled the puck and flipped it toward the net  didn't get all the wood on it he would have liked but uh  dawkins stopped it anyway  and he and he gave up some juicy rebounds though  he hasn't looked that sharp in stopping uh even the easiest shots  and and the bears gotta   have got to uh hope they get some better chances on him and get guys going to the net for rebound   two teams will be even-strength off the start of the second  the bears send the law firm out there zarowny zarowny and simpson   and calgary counters with johnson couldwell and krywulak their top line   and the dinosaurs have the puck off the faceoff  ruark working from his own end  up the right-wing boards he goes  hammers it in across the line  round and round it goes  up the left wing now for johnson   sends it to the corner to couldwell  back to johnson  he fell on the play   the bears are able to clear  here's simpson down the wing   simpson on the right side  flipped it off the linesman  chops it into the corner now  was hit by masters  colin zarowny looking for it  racing in from the point is hjertaas   puts it in behind the net to the left corner for simpson  simpson will chip it deep into the zone for colin zarowny  he had it batted away and krywulak shovels it out to centre ice  bears send it right back in  here's simpson just inside the blue line  flips one toward the net  saved by dawkins  and then aaron zarowny smashes his man as ruark tried to clear  here they come though the dinosaurs  this is johnson to centre   johnson with the puck moves in  lets a shot go  and boy did he hammer that thing wide  they score off the rebound   it went off the glass and johnson raced over and slammed it in to the open net as masson came diving across in a desperate bid to  stop that thing  he let a rocket go and everybody watched it  exactly evan   everybody watched it  the reaction time there is not what it has to be   two defencemen were back and masson could have reacted faster  he didn't react till he saw johnson uh lining up the rebound  and the two defencemen just stood and watched the rebound come out  and uh johnson's got a wicked shot for a small guy  but uh there's no way in the world he should have had a rebound that juicy  johnson his second of the playoffs   second of the night   it comes at the fifty-four second mark here of the second period  there's haney for it  now ahead to esposito  drops it back for pullishy   pullishy working from his own zone  skates to centre  flips it deep into the corner   esposito gets to it  he lets a shot go  comes back to the left point   here is pullishy  a long shot missed the net   and that's an unassisted goal for johnson  bears have it  here's strand  across the line for haney  haney moves in  shoots  saved by dawkins  nice stop  his best of the night  as haney got all that one and dawkins well out to challenge  made it a fine glove save  dawkins had to come up with a good save for once and he did  uh really nice  nice pass touch pass backhand by paul strand  and uh good wood by haney  he put his head down and ripped it  and dawkins when he saw haney put his head down he came out and uh was able to make the save  a nice glove save by dawkins   draw will be to the stick-hand side of the calgary goaltender  last night the bears went up two nothing and lost the game  tonight the dinosaurs are up by a pair   bears are gonna going to have   to face adversity tonight and come back  so anything can happen   uh not only the series could be over they're down two nothing  it's going to be tough   jickling on the faceoff against calgary's townsend  and townsend won that one  goes back into the corner for steveson  left corner for zulyniak and he plays it up the wing for marble  marble chipping it out to centre for stephenson  stephenson can't get around jickling   puck deep in the bears' zone   still it's cleared out to centre  just out of the reach of thompson  two nothing calgary in front here early in the second  long lead pass for schmalz  he's in on the bear defender christiansen who took him out  christiansen plays it ahead and away goes thompson  he's across the line  thompson takes a look  thompson feeding it out front   nobody there for alberta and the dinosaurs'll just send it down the ice  that went off the linesman otherwise it might have been icing  adair now up the wall ahead for degner and he steers it in across the the calgary line  dawkins stops it for marble   marble a long breakaway pass for the bear line but that's picked off by hjertaas  hjertaas will step across the line  in for colin zarowny  zarowny lets a shot go  and that's deflected to the corner by townsend  now a cross-ice feed to the right point  snapshot by simpson  he broke his stick on it or it was blocked in part by townsend who lost his stick on it and it dribbles in to goaltender dawkins  that's the best the bears have looked all night since that second goal by the dinos  two good shifts in a row  first by jickling's line and now zarowny's line  the law firm came out and they're playing well   they gotta have got to keep the green wave going on the dinos and uh get some flow and get some momentum going their way  draw will be to the glove-hand side of dawkins   aaron zarowny to face off against thompson  and aaron zarowny waved outta out of  there   colin zarowny now to take the draw   bears have it  here's hjertaas with a shot  pad save dawkins   he had problems with it but he covers it up   another thing here too jeff on these faceoffs is that if you're the home team it makes a difference as to who puts their stick down first  isn't it supposed to at least  uh or it's the defensive zone  and uh like i i believe the defensive zone centre has to put their uh stick down first 
Canada	 but uh whichever way it is we're get  get uh the bears are getting  tossed out of a lot of draws tonight and uh i'm not too sure the cause of that   aaron zarowny against calvin flint on this faceoff   dinosaurs win it and masters plays it ahead to thompson   to johnson   pardon me  and away goes couldwell  he's across the line  jams on the brakes  and it's batted away  bears have it  aaron zarowny a two-on-one  zarowny moving in  has simpson with him  zarowny moves in  shoots  and he ripped it wide of the net  comes out to centre   hjertaas flips it back in  couldwell comes up with it  bumps into hjertaas and simpson takes over  he'll pound it off the boards and deep into the calgary end it goes  nice try by aaron zarowny on the two-on-one  good shot just wide  krywulak long lead pass up the left side for couldwell  has johnson with him   passes to johnson  steps across the line  johnson feeding it in  save by masson   that was a mix up in front of the net and masson stopped it  here's strand  and the big hip check by ruark  moving in goodkey  goodkey with a blast  save by dawkins   strand feeling the effects of a hipcheck by ruark   bit of a charley horse i think  here's johnson the other way  he lets a blast go  save on the short side  masson got a piece of it  dinosaurs working it in now  here's schonek with a shot  that's blocked  and tiltgen will clear it out to centre ice  tiltgen trying to move it ahead to ranger  ranger bumped by schonek  bears fire it in on goal  it's offside at the blue line with sixteen oh nine to go in the second   and this game starting to open up a bit jeff   big hits  and paul strand he got porked by ruark  and uh he definitely felt that  he went came off the ice uh   limpin' limping and he's still uh is getting looked at by the trainer in the back of the bears' bench   it was about this time last night that the bears lost their leading scorer for a penalty and a game misconduct  this time he's being tended to at the bear bench  some concern down there i'm sure  big colin ranger out here for the bears  and they they need a little pick up and somebody to rock somebody's world  marble with it for calgary  over for ziliniak  and he'll flip it high in the air to the bears' zone  pullishy back to scoop it up   fires it around the boards for goodkey  softly up the wing for ranger  takes the hit ziliniak   now the dinosaurs work it in to the faceoff circle  but pullishy comes up with it and he'll send it up the open wing and out to centre ice   ziliniak's there  on the right side for morrison  lots of room  morrison moving in  morrison feeds it in front of the net  and tied up was murray for calgary  now they centre it out front for eremenko  bears clear though  here they go  tiltgen one-on-one against marble  tiltgen waiting for someone to catch up  tiltgen makes a move a nice one  passing in for degner  can't get the shot away   can't redirect it   and it's deep in the calgary zone  they clear up the wall  bears take over though  degner to the point   christiansen holding it onside  jickling after the puck left circle   takes a look top of the left circle  lets the shot go  saved by dawkins as degner was creating a screen in front  maybe the bears' best shift of the night   i'm i agree with you evan   and dean tiltgen made that shift  eh we watched him uh  he roasted evan marble  it's tough to do  very nice play between his legs and then a nice pass to degner and uhm degner almost had the one-time for the almost the open-net goal  draw to the stick-hand side of dawkins   dinosaurs in front two nothing in this one   we have fifteen ten left in the second period   jickling will face off against townsend   jickling wins it back to christiansen at the left point   he'll work it along the left-wing boards to the corner  being checked by schmalz   thompson in there to help out  thompson and christiansen they kick it free  jickling along the boards  being checked there by ruark   schmalz trying to walk it up the wing   he comes up with it  jickling all tied up by ruark  dinosaurs get to it and townsend clearing it ahead to centre ice  stephenson tips it in across the bear line but christiansen's back to play it   he clears the zone  schmalz will dump it right back in   there's adair deep in his own end  adair ahead for haney on the wing   pegg will hold it in on the right point  along the boards it goes  adair picks it up  he lofts it  there's townsend behind the net   he tried to get by adair but adair took him down   here goes thompson speeding to centre ice  mike thompson in across the line on the left side for haney  thompson goes after it himself  thompson turns to the left corner   looking for some help   it comes up the wall  hjertaas will hold it in  along the boards it goes  now jickling from the left point holds it in   to hjertaas on the left-hand boards  to the corner for thompson   thompson takes a look  thompson drops it back  moving in is simpson  simpson sharp angle  his shot is blocked by haney  went off the shaft of haney's stick and it's cleared down the ice  pegg had a hold of thompson  thompson's trying to cover on the right point  had a hold on his jersey and that's allowed calgary to clear the zone  icing charged against the dinosaurs  well another good shift by the bears there thompson jickling and degner and uh that's about three or four in a row and that's what they need to see  get some momentum going  paul strand doesn't appear to be coming back any time soon  he he really got crunched  and uh that's uh he looked in a lot of pain when he went off the ice a few minutes ago   he's not on the bench   might be trying to walk it off downstairs jeff behind the bears' bench  off the draw r marble has it for calgary  clears it ahead to johnson   johnson now out to centre ice  intended for lovsin  so they're double-shifting johnson here   bears clear down the ice  marble takes the long road in there and they wave off the icing because of it   marble from his own zone  gave it away  here's esposito moving in  esposito lets the shot go  the save by dawkins   and esposito might have passed to ranger out front but ranger had fallen as he turned   and dawkins holding onto it   evan evan   marble has actually looked human on his last two shifts  made a couple mistakes and he's had a puck uh most of this series  and uh good play by frank esposito to strip him of the puck and  and with frank he's gotta got to shoot  he's got a good shot and it's been going in for him  uh this one caught dawkins basically the numbers though  faceoff stick-hand right side of dawkins   he's becoming bigger in that net by the minute  yes he is   he looks a little bit more confident every second   out covering the angles well   here come the dinosaurs out of their own zone  couldwell trying to get around sherben  sherben spun him around at centre  aaron zarowny with it  ahead for simpson  he drags it in across the line  lets the snapshot go  he fanned on it   it goes to the corner  zulyniak will take him out and couldwell goes back to play it   couldwell with big hit on colin zarowny   zarowny right back up though  simpson now for zarowny in the left corner   zarowny trying to work around  zulyniak has a hold of him  and a penalty coming up against calgary   and i think it might be holding against zulyniak  we'll be back in a moment  two nothing dinosaurs lead the bears but the bears are going to work on the powerplay when we come back on sports radio c j s r f m eight-eight commercial, 35 sec   evan bok along with jeff rankin back in calgary  father david bauer arena  bears going to work on the powerplay  they're down two nothing and they desperately need a powerplay goal here   the puck's back in the bears' zone  masson clears it up the wing   jickling will go after it   jickling skating up the right wing trying to get away from schmalz but schmalz took it away  tiltgen there to follow up  for degner   degner's bowled over  but here's thompson across the line  thompson guns it around the boards   comes up on the left wing for jickling   goes deep to the corner for degner  degner behind the net for thompson  nobody out front  tiltgen to the point for trevor sherben  trevor sherben with a blast and he missed the target  he hammered it   jickling from the left point   thompson in the corner  back to jickling   jickling in the corner  he gave it away to ruark  and ruark a chance to clear it   he'll skate with it to centre and now tap it softly into the golden bear zone  big blast by trevor sherben  and i think it hit something  just missed the far side  bears on the powerplay down two nothing here in calgary  lead pass right side  tiltgen across the line  lets the shot go  off the blocker of goaltender dawkins   jickling behind the net to degner   degner trying to centre out front  that went off a skate back behind the goal  thompson with it   now for tiltgen on the right-wing boards  into the corner   thompson to tiltgen top of the right circle  moves in  to thompson  thompson walks out front  backhand shot  pegg blocks it and covers up  real nice slide block by uh jaime pegg  uh all coaches when they're uh showing the defensive coverage on the pe penalty killing use that and the the offside d-man shorthand for 'defenceman'  comes over and slide blocks on the two-on-one coming out of the corner  and a a real nice play by pegg on that  play   manitoba bisons lead regina cougars five nothing  the start of the third in game two of that series   and regina ahead one nothing in the series but the bisons they come out gunnin' gunning tonight  back-to-back weekends the cougars are going three games  and uh a lot of hockey for the cougars   faceoff will be to the glove-hand side of dawkins  forty-eight seconds left in this golden bear powerplay  and a golden opportunity to get into the game  they're down two nothing   not out of it but as the game wears on that lead  becomes seems to be larger and larger  the next goal's huge  here's pegg with it in his own end  he'll gun it up the boards and all the way down the ice   back to scoop it up is goodkey   goodkey from behind his net   mark goodkey lost it for a moment  now goes to chase it down in the corner  eremenko in forechecking   goodkey gets by him   krywko ahead   now haney with it  over to goodkey   missed him with a pass  goodkey sends it across the line but pegg will send it down the other way   a little sloppy in this breakout but here they go   here's a chance for haney  he's across the line  haney moving in  haney pass for aaron zarowny and aaron zarowny couldn't knock down the pass  bears nearly had a breakaway  bad change by the dinos and almost merv haney to hit uh a flying simpson  masson a heads-up play there to head-man the puck real quick  here's krywko now  the penalty is over  krywko to the line and across 
Canada	 stopped  dinosaurs   breakaway pass  couldwell down the wing  couldwell moving in lets the shot go  a high shot and goaltender masson knocks it down with his shoulder   lead pass up the left side now for simpson  simpson against zulyniak  zulyniak up to bump him  ruark takes over   the puck comes out to centre  here's a two-on-one for calgary  johnson moving in  has couldwell with him  passes over to couldwell  they pass it back and masson knocks it away  here's colin zarowny racing down the ice after it but mike ruark back to scoop it up for calgary  two nothing dinosaurs in front

 they sc score  chip it wide of the net  colin zarowny was in there   it's deep in the corner now for ranger  ranger trying to set it up front for simpson  they freeze it down there   ruark on his man   bears trying to claw it back to the blue line  that ends up in the crowd  we'll take a quick timeout  two nothing dinosaurs lead the bears on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight commercial, 30 sec   and now we'd like to welcome all the listeners back at varsity gym at the university of alberta where it's halftime in their basketball playoff game between the alberta golden bears and victoria vikings  i'm evan bok along with jeff rankin   the bears battling the dinosaurs here   we'll do a recap in the scoring in just a moment but it's two nothing for calgary as the dinosaurs fire it out front  back to the point it comes for pegg  flips it towards the net  that redirects just wide  thompson'll go back to play it   chips it back deeper in his own zone and krywko clears it out  schoneck back to pick it up for calgary   nine and a half minutes to go in the second here of game two of this best-of-three series  last night calgary won by a score of five three   bears have it in their own zone  degner drops it back deep to the corner for goodkey  had some pressure on him  bodies his man   masson thought to come out of his net   townsend has it in the right corner for calgary  townsend up the wall  it goes back into the corner now  behind the net  there's stephenson  they pass out front as morrison tried to set up his man  townsend behind the goal now as the dinosaurs all over  em them   but here come the bears  this is jickling playing out to centre ice   cleared back in  goodkey with it  cross-ice feed on the right wing  here's haney  merv haney steps across the calgary line  haney passing it on the right corner for jickling  his shot  glove save by dawkins  he knocked it down and morrison's there to pick it for the dinosaurs  he'll clear it down the ice  this should go as icing  back to play it is hal christiansen and an icing call charged  against calgary  back at the varsity gym it's forty-nine thirty-two alberta golden bears leading the victoria vikings in game one of their canada west semi-final   here in calgary the golden bears are trailing the calgary dinosaurs two nothing at the father david bauer arena  game two of their best-of-three  todd johnson opened the scoring at four thirteen of that first period on the powerplay from couldwell and krywulak a two-man advantage for calgary   that was the only scoring of the first   dinosaurs out shot the bears nine six in that opening frame  and then todd johnson his second of the playoffs it came unassisted at the fifty-four second mark even-strength here in the second  and that's how you get the two nothing lead  puck in the bears zone as ranger tries to clear it out  he can't   big hit by adair as he hit adam morrison  and the bears are going to be a man short here as adair in to lay the body on morrison tape cuts out   just wide  cavilla knocks his own net off its moorings  we get a break  coming up in our second intermission tonight stan friel  and the athletics spotlight which has become such a popular feature of our hockey broadcast  stan friel stops by with the athletics spotlight  again that's in our second intermission  take it stan-o in the second  the the bears  excuse me   the bears have uh taken the play to the pronghorns uh thirteen minutes into the second period   uh very limited chance for pronghorn in the second period  no uh out-numbered chances down low on the bears'  defencemen like in the first  and uh the bears have really straightened their game around in the second period  jickling wins the faceoff  trevor sherben with a blast and a pad save made by cavilla   looking for the puck is jickling but he was tied up by zukiwsky  and here comes o'rourke to the bear line   he can't get in with the puck  strand takes a hit along the wall  he falls on top of the puck and we get a break   i noticed jickling tying up zukiwsky  zukiwsky turned around took a swat at him   and he doesn't take much eh eh of abuse and he gives out a lot  no wonder he had so many penalty minutes  uh the bears uh in the playoffs like i said uh especially penalty killing powerplay faceoffs they are key  and uh in the whole game every coach takes stats on the faceoffs  and the bears are uh really kicking the pronghorns'   butt in the faceoff circle and that's huge cos especially near the end of the game in a three three hockey game this in the third period every faceoff you know is a legitimate scoring chance if you're in the offensive end   coach daum sends out two thirds of the law firm  jickling'll take the faceoff in place of aaron zarowny  zarowny colin back on the bench but they'll try and get the change-up as quick as they can   the horns win the faceoff though  comes back to the right point  here's woget wobick   tried to centre   takes the hit in the corner as pullishy nails him and takes him to the ice now   pullishy a bear out there literally  they freeze it in the corner for the whistle   good job by pullishy to take his man no holding  you know he gives him a shot backs up gives him another shot and uh nothing nothing illegal about it  uh they're talking to the ref right now but it's uh it's dave that's how they teach it  it was perfect  you do not keep your head down when glen pullishy is on the ice   and i think mr zukiwsky's learned that when colin zarowny  is out there he best laugh be looking around too  unless he doesn't mind gettin' getting  rocked  laugh some guys thrive on that   hey he probably doesn't mind too much  here's aaron zarowny behind his own net playing it up the wall  simpson trying to get it out  he does   and chasing it back in his own zone is knippel deep in his own zone  flips it ahead  that's knocked down by colin zarowny  however it rolls off his stick  and here goes zukiwsky  stick handling to the bear line they get it in across  it's offside though as dana rieder well ahead of the play  zukiwsky stood up well at the blue line by the bear defense and that forced that play to go offside  now he's having a talk with mark goodkey  you could jus just   you could put a spotlight on zukiwsky cos it  something's always happening  he's either got the puck he's getting hit he's slashing he's  hittin' hitting somebody   and uh you just watch him because something's always happening  he's chirpin' chirping or   sommin' something   why don't the oilers edmonton professional hockey team pick him up  not bad  big strong player  he is  lots of grit  mr sather one-time general manager of the oilers probably  not tuned in tonight but if there're any oiler scouts listening there's jarret zukiwsky  give him a shot   ken morrison scored forty goals in twenty-eight games a few years ago  and zuku zukiwsky scored thirty-seven the closest to match that mark this year  then there's a finder's fee too by the way if he ever suits up   colin zarowny gets it ahead to simpson   and it's knocked down by the lethbridge defence   and carpenter turns gets it out to centre  colin zarowny reaching for it  he'll hammer it right back in  it goes in behind the lethbridge net   spinning back there is wobick  clears it ahead  gatto is rocked by colin zarowny but managed to get it ahead  and here's carpenter   carpenter to the line  he's taken down taken out pardon me by pullishy   the bears clear it in  aaron zarowny in the left corner  bears in the midst of a line change so he doesn't have any help  and moving the puck out this is riehl  ahead to carpenter  sends it in across the line  masson knocks it down  sets it up there for christiansen  he was rocked in a hard hit by gatto   and now back to play it in his own zone is tiltgen  tiltgen tripped over christiansen's stick his own teammate   that caused a turnover  here's a chance for lethbridge  a backhand shot sails wide of the target  adair with it in the alberta corner trying to freeze it  he can't   now they centre out front  masson will knock it down as driving to the net was lance burns but masson's on top of it  four fifty-one left in the second  a three three tie alberta and lethbridge  this is sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight point five  commercial, 30   canada west playoff hockey action here at the clare drake  three three tie  the golden bears and the pronghorns their first ever meeting in the playoffs   the bears able to clear the puck out of their own end  knippel will fire right back in  masson sets it up in behind his own net for hjertaas   and here goes strand with the puck  strand's lead pass just out of the reach of jickling and it ends up back in the lethbridge zone  now jickling knocks down an errant pass   sets it up for haney  haney centring out front  that's knocked down by graham and the horns will clear it out  here's burns now  he's stood up by trevor sherben  it's getting rough out there folks   and here's trevor sherben behind his own net  flips it ahead for jickling  he knocked it down  got it ahead to strand  nice move  two-on-one   strand with haney  strand moving in  strand moving in  shoots  save  cavilla he's got it   great play by paul strand  beat two guys in the neutral zone  two-on-one with haney and he made the right play  they took away the pass  he went to the net   showed great patents  patience excuse me  i thought he was going to bury it  uh good save by uh cavilla  and uh uh that's what they need uh  paul strand has been a little bit silent tonight for him and usually he he pretty much runs the show out there and uh uh he started it there  a beautiful play  a dougie gilmour type move as he raced in on a  two-on-one  the defender took the pass away so he went in on cavilla  and cavilla actually backed into his net quite deep but strand couldn't put it past him  right   faceoff to the glove side of the lethbridge netminder   and back to play it's o'rourke  o'rourke passing ahead to the line   rieder knocks it down  now zukiwsky over to harper  he's in across the line  harper takes a look  passes out front  it's off a skate  simpson flips it ahead  and here's pullishy racing down the left side  pullishy gets it ahead to colin zarowny  his pass is knocked down 
Canada	 pullishy'll pick it up at the centre ice stripe   plays it back for goodkey  ahead to aaron zarowny and he'll clear it in across the line  bears will change em them up  they send esposito degner and cam sherben out   cleared down the ice into the alberta zone  krywko with it   krywko to esposito  three and a half minutes to play in period number two  three three tie bears and the pronghorns  in across the line  esposito whips a pass through the goalmouth  offside bears at the blue line though   cam sherben is gettin' getting   about his second or two good shifts killin'  killing a penalty  he gets a chance to play a regular-strength shift  they've moved terry degner to play with him and frank esposito for a bit  and uh here comes strand and uh probably jickling to even out that line merv haney  this line they started off the game big  they had a good shift last shift  that's probably why coach daum's got em them   right back out there  uh they really have dominated o like  we've seen em them dominate in the past  jickling will face off against dasewicz   and the horns win the faceoff  riehl with it  plays it over for wobick   bears knock it down  hjertaas played it into his own bench   three oh three left in the second and a three three tie here   bears had the best defence in the canada west this year a two point nine goals against average   lethbridge fifth best out of eighteen three ninety-three average  and on offense lethbridge second best offence  bears fifth best   fairly even i guess just opposite type teams heh  that's right   here comes strand with it for alberta  drops it off for jickling  jickling skates to centre   spins away from a couple of checks   his pass knocked down  here's a big hit by hjertaas as he hammered jason dasewicz   trevor sherben back to hjertaas  his long lead pass picked up by haney and he'll flip it to the lethbridge line   strand knocks that down  he feathered a pass over to haney   haney's in across the line trying to kick the puck free  it's in his skates on the left-wing boards in the lethbridge zone  they freeze it and get a whistle   the bears'll get a draw in the lethbridge end   pretty much what we expected evan two evenly-matched teams  they split the season series   we got two twenty-six left in the second period and three three  and in the last five minutes hasn't a lot hasn't     sorry  excuse me  a lot hasn't happened  and uh you know kinda kind of either way and not a lot of great chances for either team  and uh they're really starting to settle down and it's a tight game  bears   ya  bears have tightened right up here in the second i would say   pronghorns haven't had those good chances  the bears like they haven't the great chances either but uh they're playing more their style of game here  you're right  two two laugh two twenty-six   left in the second period  three three tie here at the clare drake   university of alberta golden bears and the lethbridge pronghorns deadlocked at three each  and kelln will send it down into the bears' zone  back to play it krywko   krywko skates it ahead to tiltgen   tiltgen takes a look  tiltgen was hooked off the puck at the last moment and the pronghorns force the turnover  now graham with it at centre  graham takes a look  tried the fancy behind-the-back pass  that didn't work  adair has it   over to krywko   back to adair and the bears clear it out   fired right back in though by knippel   penalty coming up   adair has the puck behind his own net  and there will be a spearing penalty looks like   not a not a smart play at all by dean tiltgen   and this will cost the bears a man   at least four minutes i believe   where'd this happen   neutral zone i wou would   right in front of us there  ya   dean tiltgen had a good rush up the ice and uh a couple of seconds ago   he looked like he was going to hit the blue line with great speed  he got hooked from behind  a little hook  nothing major but it could have been a call definitely  he went down and and he is frustrated the whole shift  and he came back and uh speared the guy right in the numbers and he's got four minutes  they didn't kick him out of the game  didn't think it was a pitchfork but it definitely   he turned his stick over  it was a spear  probably call it a stick infraction   generally what they call it if it's not a major   it's four minutes anyways  and this is key  this is huge  key four minutes for the pronghorns on the powerplay especially considering it's late in one period   it'll probably carry over to the early part of the third  one fifty-two left in the second  stands to reason that'd happen  the only way it wouldn't is if the pronghorns happen to take a  penalty themselves or score i guess a couple of goals   or twice   exactly  this is a laugh this is a  turning point of the game right here   aaron zarowny wins the faceoff  he's along the boards trying to fish it free to his teammate  the pronghorns have it though  back at the left point  harper over for kelln  he flips it toward the net  they score  dana rieder tips it in and it's a four three lethbridge lead   four minutes for spearing to tiltgen is what they called it   and the pronghorns make em them pay  and   coach ra ron kraft in your interview evan was ah was very high on dana rieder  he thought he might even be the m v p for this club other than jarret zukiwsky  and uh uhh made a nice play there  just drifts in front of the net   shot came from the point from number five travis  kelln  kelln   and nice deflection over top of masson's shoulder  ya they short that well  comes at eighteen eighteen   still on the powerplay   rieder from kelln and harper at eighteen eighteen and lethbridge back in front four three  and like you say they stay on the powerplay  they're now two for four on the powerplay  this is their fifth now   this is the second minor to tiltgen   and here is zukiwsky turning at his own blue line  he hasn't got wound up yet on this powerplay   he gets to the line  they move it in across  it's offside though as rieder jumped the gun on the right wing  so that goal by lethbridge a big one late in the second period  they're up four three  and the bears a good play on that rush by zukiwsky stood up on the blue line   made him dump the puck in  he refused to dump it in  they took his team offside  a minute twenty-one left in the second and uh uhh simpson zarowny and the the two d-men have to kill this off for the bears  aaron zarowny waved out of the faceoff area as was zukiwsky  as was rieder  pardon me  here's simpson facing off for alberta   simpson against gatto and lethbridge has the puck  they'll try to work it in across the line  they don't  here's a chance for the golden bears  simpson moving in on a break  simpson moving in toward the net  simpson can't get a shot away  he's hooked on the play by gatto  a penalty coming up   he wasn't in scott free with control of the puck  we won't see a penalty shot but that a timely penalty so far as alberta is concerned as it kills off the pronghorn powerplay  and once again these uh aaron zarowny and uh ken simpson have come up big for the bears  they've played ah an excellent hockey game the first forty minutes and uh the bears could not let another powerplay goal in there and they came up  they got a nice bounce off a blocked shot  and uh almost a breakaway for ken simpson but he did draw the penalty   even up we're going to go four on four the last minute and  minute seven seconds  and this'll be exciting hockey four on four   so gatto goes to the penalty box  two minutes for hooking i believe   and the faceoff will be deep in lethbridge territory stickhand side of cavilla   and like jeff mentioned four on four four skaters on four skaters as jickling prepares to face off  he wins the draw  now goodkey lets the shot go  that's blocked  and here's a two-on-two for lethbridge as zukiwsky gains the blue line  zukiwsky takes a look  falls on the play as he turned with the puck   and pullishy plays it over for goodkey   there's a hooking penalty to gatto   and here come the bears in across the line  this is goodkey  he lost it as he tried to drop it back   and it's cleared out by zukiwsky  down the ice it go   in across the line is riehl  riehl takes a look  in behind the net tried to centre   and goodkey with it behind the net  up for jickling  strand had his stick and his glove swept away   zukiwsky bumping with jickling  puts him in a headlock and there'll be a penalty against lethbridge for that   twenty seconds to go in the period  here's degner with it  degner takes a look   degner from his own line   degner skating to centre  ten seconds to go  degner will have to set it up quick  degner takes a look  centres out front  pass behind everybody   that'll do it for the period  five seconds left as trevor sherben lets the long shot go  it'll be whistled down but jarret zukiwsky with not a real clever play there as he was bumped   actually i think he was bumped by jickling but as he's skating off he put jickling in a headlock  and you talk about tiltgen maybe not taking a great   a great penalty there was not a clever one by mr zukiwsky  you're exactly right evan   and it was a good play by mike jickling  he took it  he took the headlock took the face rub and he just skated away  he wasn't even talking to zukiwsky  he knew that he drew the penalty   uh a good heads-up play by jickling character play  some shows uh some uh leadership for this team  and uh uh bears are gonna going to   have a powerplay in the early in the  third period to see if they can tie this game up  one second left in the second period so they'll do the ceremonial toss of the puck   penalties zukiwsky two minutes for holding or headlocking   degner got a ten minute misconduct as did riehl   two minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct each degner and riehl  pardon me  two minutes   all righty   that's better than a ten minute misconduct from a bears'  standpoint i would think  mhh hmm   definitely  don't want to have degner out for the first half of the  third period  they toss the puck in and that's it for the second period   so alberta in front four three through two periods of play  and i wouldn't want to be dean tiltgen going to the box going to the bench right now cos uh if rob daum doesn't say anything to him may maybe  that's his way but some coaches would uh lay right in to mr tiltgen right now  and uh i'm not sure how coach daum does it but uh i mean playoff time it's two out of three  there's no room for error  and uh you can't afford to be stickin'   sticking a guy in the numbers uh for a obvious spear   so again real quick on those penalties the nineteen fifty-nine mark degner and riehl two minutes each for unsportsmanlike conduct and then the original penalty to jarret zukiwsky two minutes for holding  the reason they gave uh degner and riehl penalties is cos they kind of milled about after the after the fact after the uh play was called and referee doesn't like that of course  wants to keep a handle on things  so after forty minutes of play four three alberta in front  of the  pardon me  lethbridge in front of the alberta golden bears  and uh eighteen seconds the start of the third period ah a big chance for the bears  they're gonna going to have thirty-five seconds of two-man advantage and ah ah a golden opportunity for them to tie this game up 
Canada	 and i would think that rob daum will be working on some sort of a play off the start of the third period  what a golden opportunity here  they get the break and uh can work on a couple of plays i guess if they win the win the draw and try something and then they'll have another one up their sleeve if they uh win another draw and they haven't scored yet so  definitely  he's ah a very very a great coach technically and he'll have something up his sleeve  and as soon as they get set up we'll see the good five-on-three happening  all right four three the pronghorns lead the golden bears after two periods of play  we're back with stan friel's athletic spotlight  that's up next  you're listening to golden bears playoff hockey on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight commercials, interview, and news, 14 min. 25 sec.   third period's underway  bears on the powerplay trailing by a goal  they're down four three  here's a pass to jickling on the left point   they're got a five-on-three now  tipped away at the pronghorn blue line though   the bears will have to regroup as jickling turns  he'll move it in across the line  flips it in the left corner  good chance for kelln to clear and he does   bears on a five-on-three powerplay for another fifteen seconds  as trevor sherben starts out from behind his own net  lead pass left side to haney  ahead to strand  back to haney  the pass just behind him  strand has it high on the left point  now over to trevor sherben  his shot went off the glass   and the pronghorns able to clear it to the line but not out  now they'll clear out as gatto's out of the box   and here's strand skating at centre  he lost it   carpenter trying to pick it up  jickling lost control   two pronghorns after it deep in the bears' zone and jickling drops it back for trevor sherben  he'll have to hurry  gives it back to jickling   bears forty seconds left in the powerplay  they give it away  here is gatto moving in  gatto takes a look  his pass is blocked and it's behind trevor sherben   comes up on the left-wing boards  and here goes strand to centre  strand takes a look  steps in across the line  strand falls on the play trying to pass  that's broken up  here goes carpenter  carpenter to the line   offside pronghorns though and we get a break  so the bears still seventeen seconds left in the powerplay and seventeen seconds left of course in the minor penalty to jarret zukiwsky  and not what the doctor ordered or c  coach daum ordered thirty-five seconds with the two-man advantage and uh uhh nothing actually  and bears too much trying too much  to do too much uh by themselves  not enough passing   not enough set plays  and uh you got eighteen minutes left twenty  twenty minutes to start the period there's no need to be doing everything by yourself yet   changed some scoring on us and uh changed some assists so we'll update you on that in just a moment when we get a moment's time  here's krywko with it in his own end   dangerous goalmouth pass but he got the pass away  and bears clear but can't get it out  here's harper moving in  lets the wrist shot go  that bounces into the corner   there's filipenko for it for lethbridge  that's broken up  and krywko will chase it down in his own corner   that's it  the pronghorns are back to even strength  here's a shot  save by masson on the short side off of graham  bears try to clear up the wall  they're in a little bit of trouble in their own end  here's graham centring   esposito took a whack at it to get rid of it  now thompson plays it over to esposito and he backhands it in across the line  it goes in behind the calgar  calgary the lethbridge net   in the right corner there's thompson trying to pick it up  aaron zarowny digging it free   zarowny takes a look  walk out  lets the shot go   and that's blocked and cleared down the ice into alberta territory  masson sets it up there for christiansen  his long lead pass for thompson  thompson turns and put it right on the tape of rieder's stick  rieder now for o'rourke  off-wing shot that missed the target but not by much on the short side   and here's aaron zarowny with it behind the net   zarowny trying to clear it ahead  zukiwsky steals  he takes a look  centres through the goalmouth  nobody there for lethbridge  bears can't clear though  rieder holds it onside  zukiwsky knocked it down but christiansen has it now   christiansen lost it in front of his own net  dangerous play  and o'rourke couldn't centre   now christiansen battling for it behind the net   puck up along the boards  pinching in from the point this is knippel  his pass that's blocked   comes through out front again   finally the bears clear  here they come   this is simpson  three on one  simpson moves in  passes across  thompson  he missed the net   holy smokes he missed the net   that wasn't the indian ocean  it was the atlantic   he had to one-time it though   missed the target   now fighting for it in the corner colin zarowny  passing out front  out of the reach everybody  and here comes kelln to centre   his lead pass  carpenter moving in  it's offside  boy oh boy bears had a great chance to tie it up   and in fairness to mike thompson i think the puck may have been rolling on edge but a glorious opportunity goes for naught  well mike thompson it it was a tough shot you're right evan cos it was on edge and it   it was also in his skates  he's a right-handed shot on the left-hand side  it was in his skates   he kind of had to choke up and uh volley it out of the air like soccer  and uh it's too bad  he missed on the short side  real quick  they've changed the assists on mark goodkey's goal the first one of the game for alberta  mark goodkey still gets the goal but merv haney and mike jickling get assists   that was at six forty-eight of the first  and the assists we didn't give you on degner's goal in the second period jickling and thompson get credit for assists on that one  so bears trailing by a goal  here's trevor sherben to the line and across   he goes down as he had a little help  pulled to the ice by mark wobick   now trevor sherben trying to send it in deep  here's a long   well they tried the long feed but jeremy riehl thought better of it   here goes trevor sherben  gave it away whoa laugh almost in front of his own net  jason dasewicz was looking for it  haney in looking for the puck in uh lethbridge territory but gatto fishes it free inside his own zone  bears pick it up though  haney now to jickling  jickling cycling it in behind the net   strand didn't anticipate the pass and there is carpenter with it   carpenter trying to send it to the bear line  he cannot  degner with it now   degner drives in across the line  degner takes a look  can't get past the defence  this could go as icing   back to play it is pullishy   as he touches it icing is the call  quickly what happened in that second period terry degner tied it up for alberta on the powerplay at nine eleven  mike jickling and mike thompson with assists   but then lethbridge pulled ahead again at eighteen eighteen  dana rieder from travis kelln and harper   that came at eighteen eighteen on the powerplay  so the bears trail the horns four three as we play in the third period here  by the way the shots on goal in that second period twelve four in favour of the bears  so they've outshot lethbridge thirty-one fifteen  lethbridge an opportunist team though   they've put four past masson in this one  and scoring chances haven't been that im wide of a margin though  shane roest with it behind his own net for lethbridge   he'll stride right out front   skates with it  flips it up to graham   they get it in across the line  esposito a chance to move it  he cannot  it's kicked in a little deeper  now esposito will battle for it   flips it up to the point not out  puck sails wide of the alberta goal   and after the puck adair able to poke it out to centre ice   flipped back in by knippel  goes off the back boards and krywko's there to play it   krywko starts from his own end  flips it ahead   here's degner on the right wing  degner takes a look  stick stickhandles in across the line  takes a backhand shot and a stick save by cavilla  there looked to be a little bit of room there  here's a shot by adair   saved by cavilla   and he'll hold on with fourteen seventeen to go in the third  tune in tomorrow night  we'll have game two of this best-of-three series  we're on with our pregame show at seven o'clock   the game starts at seven thirty  pretty good crowd down here  although it'd be nice to see an even a larger one tomorrow night  jeff   it could be better  and uh uh fourth-year man terry degner is is  showing some leadership out here in the last  uhh in the first six minutes of this third period  he's playing heads-up hockey  he's making some nice plays   and he's not giving the puck away  i don't think the uh coach daum told uh in the the pep talk in between periods for   his their d-men defenceman to throw it in front of their net a half dozen times laugh at the  at the start of the third period  it's been scary here   on the draw dana rieder wins it away from aaron zarowny and it's cleared out to centre ice by the lethbridge pronghorns  trevor sherben will fire it right back in  back to pick it up mike krooshoop  he gave it away at the blue line  trevor sherben put it right back on his stick   and it's cleared down to the bear line  here goes o'rourke moving in  o'rourke trying to stickhandle in on masson  masson knocks it down  it's underneath him   referee lourdes blows it dead as o'rourke fell  and that's always a dangerous play for the netminder when a player goes down <, regardless of how and the play continu es and he's sliding in toward the net  ya the puck could have go  gone been anywhere under masson   luckily for him it was under his pads and not behind him  uh they got the big line out here again zukiwsky's line   and uh against uh zarowny zarowny and simpson  here comes jickling to take the draw once again in his own end  but uh this has been a a good story tonight and they've matched up well  and uh zarowny's line definitely hasn't been outclassed by zukiwsky's line  jickling against zukiwsky on the faceoff glovehand side of masson  on the draw bears try to clear it out   they can't   now they get another chance  aaron zarowny with it  flips it ahead for simpson  simpson's got a step on the right wing  simpson jams on the brakes  lets a shot go  save cavilla  they jam  and they shoot off the goal post   it's loose out front   and it's scooped into the body of one of the golden bears  and there's going to be a penalty  he's getting a penalty   good call by the referee lourdes   and it's probably a good play by darren rieder  oh   dana rieder pardon me  as he jumps on the loose puck outside the crease and he'll take the penalty  the net was wide open again   man i think i believe   that was colin zarowny who had the tap in at the side of the net  after a a super play by kent simpse  simpson the initial shot 
Canada	 the pride of saint john new brunswick heidi hanlon in her quiet unassuming way has arrived at the threshold of curling glory   last night she used a lot of perseverance and some timely shot making to lead her rank to an extra end semi-final victory over curling legend heather houston of thunder bay ontario   this rock made it all delightfully official a nine seven  extra end victory  the hanlon team was moving on into the final  a surprise to some but not to heidi interview with heidi hanlon   heidi knows that the big teams are all gone now except for the one that's waiting in the wings   julie sutton has made the b c champions one of the biggest of all  this exuberant rank is relaxed and looking towards its first ever national final   and julie sutton certainly knows how to win the big one  she's proved that  six years ago she captured her first national junior title then one year later she skipped her rank to a second canadian junior championship and in nineteen eighty-eight julie racked up the first ever world junior women's crown   this is her second appearance in a scott tournament of hearts  her first run at the national title in nineteen eighty-nine in kelowna fell just short   now she's back and the other ranks have been trying to catch up all week   that's how julie likes it   it's all part of the plan interview with julie sutton   one of the prizes could be claimed in albertville france next february where today's winner will represent canada at the sixteenth winter olympic games   momentum will be crucial to get there and the sutton rink has picked up a full head of steam interview with julie sutton   julie sutton like heidi hanlon is looking at her first ever national women's title and sutton has never lost in a championship final  today the hot hands square off in this cold prairie city  from saskatoon it's the tenth edition of the scott tournament of hearts and canada is about to crown a new curling queen   here at saskatchewan place we're just moments away from the opening ceremonies that will precede today's championship game involving british columbia and new brunswick  hi everybody i'm don whittman and pleased to be working again  with two-time world champion don duguid  don the fact that british columbia defeated new brunswick eight two on the first draw of round-robin play will that be a psychological advantage for julie sutton today  i really think so  anytime that you beat uh the opposing team in the final in the round-robin play it is a real advantage and not only that she beat her  handily but uh you know uh hanlon's coming on very strong played a great game last night and i think julie's gonna going to have to be on top of her game  well hanlon had to get some inspiration from the fact that she came from behind to defeat a former world champion heather houston last night in the semi-final  well it looked like she was gonna going to  get blown out early don but she hung in there made some great shots to keep her team in the game  her percentages weren't that high but she played excellent in the eighth and ninth end and that won her the game so you know uh she's playing strong and it's going to be a great great game  this is the tenth anniversary of the scott tournament of hearts and this year's event in saskatoon has some fond memories for  another member of our broadcast crew who won the very first scott tournament of hearts in regina sound clip of colleen jones winning   a little more subdued on this visit to saskatoon than she was ten years ago  colleen nice to have you working with us again  you got off to a great start in this year's championship winning your first three but then you had some problems but you're down at ice level and you're going to tell us what these  ladies are thinking and uh what the competition will be like   well the   well i tell ya you  they're really nervous but talking to both skips just moments ago they're really confident and uh both teams are are  planning on winning this thing  they're they're terrific teams  julie sutton plays very very wide open and on this kind of ice it seems to be the strategy that works the best  heidi hanlon though is willing to mix it up  we saw it last night against heather houston  she's willing to put rocks in play and gamble and go for it and she's coming up with the right shots at the right time  the ice has been a factor all week  it's treacherous but certainly this sheet that w they're playing on it curls more than any of the others so i think we will be able to see a few rocks in play  don  b c with a record of ten and one during the week  new brunswick with a record of eight and three  british columbia with the buy yesterday of course and new brunswick had to await two tie-breaking games before  determining that they would face ontario in the semi-final  at this time we welcome other stations along the network that have just joined us for our live coverage of the scott tournament of hearts championship game from saskatchewan place in saskatoon  the opening ceremonies where the two competing teams will be introduced just about to get under way  during the course of the week crowds have been very large here at saskatchewan place  as a matter of fact an attendance record for this event has been established  better than seventy thousand spectators have taken in proceedings and they're looking for close to four to five thousand to  watch this championship game  the two competing ranks british columbia and new brunswick  now being piped into saskatchewan place   heidi hanlon three times in the past has been a competitor   and this is the most successful performance of the scott tournament of hearts for heidi hanlon and her new brunswick crew   they of course would like to cap it all with a victory today but julie sutton of british columbia has some ideas of her own   julie sutton has never lost in a championship game in a zone playdown in a provincial playdown or in a national or world final  she of course the nineteen eighty-eight world junior champion  well if you're heidi hanlon that's pretty frightening you know  i mean here you are in a final and this uh uhm julie sutton hasn't lost a final it's it's pretty scary  game announcer, crowd cheering and national anthem   well i'm sure don duguid that uh there are butterflies in the stomachs of all ten women down on the ice  the four who will be playing and the fifth player and in instances coaches  yes you're very very nervous right at the start of a game but you get in the hack throw the first rock or brush the first rock you   kinda kind of lose the butterflies and get into the flow of the game but before you start you are very very nervous  elaine jackson who is the fifth player and the coach of the b c team was of course a member of the championship squad that won the world title a couple of years back in chicago  and heidi hanlon has as her fifth player her mother ellen brenner who has been a longtime new brunswick competitor and a rival on the curling ice in the province of new brunswick over the years and  is the fifth member of this new brunswick team  well a great steadying influence to have your mother not only as your coach but she's there with you all the time i think that's super  last night it looked as though the new brunswick women were going in to be in serious trouble against  two-time canadian champion heather houston of thunder bay  it seemed on the first three ends that every time she went to throw heidi hanlon was looking at three or four ontario stones  she managed to persevere and then on the eighth end cracked a big three to uh take the lead  stole another one on the ninth for a two point lead heading home  some thought that perhaps her chances of advancing to the final  disappeared when she whiffed a wide open takeout on the tenth end to enable ontario to pick up a pair and tie the match but she came back and she was right on target with her final stone at the extra end  well now it wasn't an easy hit  it looked fairly easy don you know it was on the in-turn side  and uh any time you're throwing away out towards the boards it's uh not an easy hit and she just threw it just beautifully and made great contact with it  uh but you know the early part of that game they really struggled and i thought uh maybe heather houston might get away from them  but they hung in there as you have to do  you can't can never give up in a curling game never ever no matter if you're four or five down  b c will have the advantage of last rock on this opening end  as mary harding gets this championship game started   she has only been curling for six years   didn't take up the sport until she was thirty years of age  mary replaces uh heidi's original lead judy blanchard who had a baby on december twenty-fourth but judy blanchard is uh home in new brunswick watching anxiously and she's played for heidi for years and years  she has been in almost daily contact with the new brunswick rink offering words of encouragement   well you know the responsibility of the lead of course is to always put the rock where the skip wants it but in this case uh heidi hanlon said no mary we wanna want to get the first rock in so i can see uh how keen it is and whether it's changed from our practice session and if it's gonna going to change in direction or movement a bit  so uh she threw it right in there and that's uh a  g a good responsibility of the lead to make sure that you're up and in the rings the very first down  karri willms who is a uh history of arts student at the university of victoria removed that new brunswick stone  and now mary harding the new brunswick lead is again being asked to play in a stone at the top of the twelve foot  you were talking about the perseverance of this heidi hanlon rink and i know that playing against them a lot in the maritimes they never ever give up  they're always there and they never panic  you'll see some teams they'll get down a couple of points and panic and start throwing badly but not this team   they have a lot of character  mary harding's stone coming to rest a little deeper than skip heidi hanlon really wanted  so now julie sutton is asking for a hit on this stone from her lead karri williams uh willms   uh you can see from the ice that julie sutton has given karri that there is very little movement to the rock  she put the brush right on the edge of the rock so it means it runs very very straight with takeout weight  karri was telling me that she was absolutely thrilled to be asked to play uh with the sutton girls at the beginning of the year  she travelled throughout europe last year and she was so excited to get back into the game especially at this level   members of the sutton rink were taking a look at that stone just to the uh left of the sheet of ice to see whether or not it was a biter but uh on our overhead camera we saw it was just outside the rings  b c a lie in one and sherri stewart of new brunswick second is attempting the removal of that stone  they'll have to sweep it to catch a corner of it 
Canada	 now that's a good shot for our viewers don  they she just touched that rock and because it is very very keen it slid out of the ring so you can see how very very fast the ice is  you can hit almost three quarters of a rock and your shooter's  uh very difficult to stay so it's very keen   melissa soligo the british columbia second now attempting to place one in the rings  you'll notice the rushes that the b c rink is using  we'll talk a little more about those later in the telecast   they're trying to take advantage of that stone just outside the rings over on the left-hand side of your screen   they'd ideally like to get it just in behind that rock but it  appears as though it's going to pull up just a little short   colleen you were telling us that your experience on this ice particularly on this centre sheet there's more movement to the outside of the rings then there is down the centre line  interestingly enough with this sheet they had to reflood it twice uh because of a few problems and this sheet does move a lot more than the other the other uh sheets but you have to pick your spot  it is swingy here on the in-turn side that sherri is throwing for this in-turn draw  it will move  but if you try to come the other way on the out-turn to bury around a centre-guard it doesn't move as well  is there any reason don why they wouldn't have attempted to go  to the other side of the house and in behind those two corner guards  belonging to b c  well   heidi hanlon does not have word or two so if she goes in behind then that's an opportunity for julie sutton to  to follow her down and may score s two points in that area  she wants to play away from those two corner guards  those two guards on the left actually are in favour of julie sutton  so without last rock she wants to keep play to the open side of the ice   oh yes and in the centre  that rock really moved over a little bit too far and it's very high  it's not in the rings   so they may be able to hit and roll behind cover with this one  she's gonna going to hit it on the other side  she's going to roll the opposite direction   the stone just delivered by melissa soligo rolls out of play   you always like in this first end to have this opportunity to  throw a throw a draw without having the pressure of knowing that uh you could be a little deeper a little  uhm little light still  so you're still kind of working on your draw weight even though the curlers get practice time before the uh before the   game a lot of timing lapses between practice time and actual game time  the delivery by sheri stewart on an attempted draw over on the right-hand side came up short and this one by kathy floyd also  pulls up short  well now julie sutton's gonna going to   take advantage of this one don  you see the rock is away off to the side  now julia speaker doesn't say 'julie' sutton will gamble in that area and if it doesn't work out for her and there's a whole bunch of rocks in there uh by the opposition she simply has the full range to draw to   but if those rocks were more into the centre how do you get into the four-foot   so when you have last rock you play it at the sides and when you do not have last rock you play into the centre  julie and jodie sutton are twins obviously not identical  julie is sixteen minutes older  i suggested that is perhaps the reason she is the skip  laugh   jodie skipped the team that they won their first canadian junior title with and uh at that year they didn't go on to a world championship cos there was no world junior championship for women at that time  that's a beautiful shot  isn't that a gorgeous curling shot at the very first end   that's very pretty   and that was the danger the new brunswick team dra  dropping that rock short of the rings  you heard the instruction from heidi hanlon to her third kathy floyd  just enough weight to push that red b c stone out of the rings   well there's another good shot   so with the hit and roll new brunswick now lies one   well that's an excellent shot  good control of her takeout weight by kathy floyd  any more weight don she might've stayed very straight and  or the rock may have fallen back against the turn a bit  so that was good control of your weight  that is very important on this ice  it's weight sensitive ice   this sutton rink they're one of the strongest hitting teams i've ever seen from a women's team before and they don't believe they can miss a hit which is a marvelous thing a marvelous confidence to have  well elaine jackson the fifth player and the coach was telling me that during a week of round-robin competition skip julie sutton missed just one hit  that's unbelievable   that is an unbelievable situation  that you go through a competition and miss one takeout uhm  and just talking to julie uh moments before the game and i asked her what kind of shot do you want to win it and she said the same shot you had in eighty-two laugh   a wide open hit  do you think she would react the same way  she said she'll go crazier   laugh   i think that may have inspired the sport of bungee jumping that performance of yours in regina ten years ago now   laugh   however there was no elastic band to haul you back in regina laugh   that's the thing yes   i needed one   she wants to hang around with her shooter  she doesn't wanna want to roll out of the rings  well she changes the shot for julie sutton with the hit and roll into the back of the eight foot  now you know why she wants to stay with that takeout don  is the fact that if she rolls out then it'll allow uh british columbia to draw around any one of those corner guards  now heidi hanlon is forcing the play on that shot stone   now what would she mean unless it really goes big that way i'd rather take it to the centre   unless it curls a lot and then she'll roll behind the corner guard if not she wants to roll to the centre  the rock really finishes big at the end  gonna going to have to go hard on it to get a piece of it  so with julie sutton hitting and rolling out several options now for heidi hanlon   now you heard julie say i turned it over a bit  what she means is that she rolled her wrist and the rock made a motion inside the broom  she really didn't l let the rock glow  go clean   it's a common habit of a lot of curlers throwing the in-turn  they roll their wrist over and the first reaction of the rock is to the inside of the intended target   they're not going to get it past that guard  she was trying to sneak behind that new brunswick guard and get it in there but they are going to get a bit of a break cause they're going to rub off that guard and catch a bite of the twelve foot to lie one   i said a common habit with a lot of curlers and you heard heidi say i must've turned it in   from down here on ice level she didn't look like she threw it badly at all  she looked like she was up the broom but uh i th don't think they anticipated that big a swing right there   because it is swinging a little bit more on that in-turn side than it had been during the week   now if julie sutton hits this rock right on the nose it'll be a blank end and that's exactly what she would like   either that or a shooter roll away not stay in the rings  she may end up in the rings  yes she is going to catch a piece of the twelve foot  she really did not want that with last stone  she wanted to count more than one  now they are not removing the other stone at the top of the twelfth  they may call for a measurement here  from our overhead camera perspective it would appear that that stone is out of play but they are going to ask for a measurement to determine whether or not that rock is biting  i don't think it is but you have the opportunity to measure why not  we did test the rings uh during the week to make sure they're accurate and the rings here are fairly accurate  when it looks out it usually is  and indeed it is out of play so it's a score of one for british columbia on the opening end  julie sutton with last rock was hoping to blank but her final stone caught a piece of the twelve foot and she picks up a single point and after one end of play in the championship game it's b c one new brunswick nothing tv advertisements   nineteen eighty-nine b c championship nineteen ninety-one b c championship   will there be a canadian championship to add to her list of credits   she leads one nothing playing this second end against heidi hanlon of new brunswick but has relinquished last rock advantage to new brunswick  you know it's been four years since a british columbia rink won the canadian women's championship  it's been twenty-eight years since a rink from new brunswick  captured the canadian title  that was mabel deware back in nineteen sixty-three  i think heidi's following the uh cue set by jim sullivan who of course was in the brier final but lost to ed werenich last year  that perhaps gave her a little extra bit of confidence knowing that uh new brunswickers can curl and can curl well  colleen would that suggest with the success that jim sullivan had last year at the brier in sault saint marie and what heidi hanlon has accomplished here in saskatoon at the scott tournament of hearts that curling in new brunswick is on the rise  curling in new brunswick is very very strong  one of the problems that eastern teams face though is that  it's a numbers game  there are so few curlers to draw from still just because our populations are smaller   but certainly curling there is extremely strong  well they must have a good program because uhm both heidi hanlon and jim sullivan team if you watch them throw the rocks  they're they're almost flawless in their curling deliveries which means they spend a lot of time at it and any time that you got a good curling delivery you're going to be very successful   and they're playing it very wide open here and uh the thing that you notice when they play it wide open is that they hit the rock almost on the nose every time don  i think that there's been nine rocks played ten rocks played in this end and they've hit the rock on the nose nine times  one excepting was the roll over to the position where it is now so that tells you that they are very very accurate   and wouldn't you know it as soon as i said that they hit and roll out  but the important part is she did make contact with the opposition stone and removed it from the rings   and with the time clock being used here at the scott tournament of hearts very little wasted time between shots  the time clocks have certainly been a marvelous addition to  curling not just for television viewers at home but for the curlers themselves who don't like slow games  and none of the curlers all week have been in any danger of uh being close to having to forfeit a game because they've run out of time  each side gets seventy-five minutes and it works much like uh  a chess clock in speed chess where it stops and starts whoever has control of the rings 
Canada	 the olympiahalle in munich germany site of the nineteen seventy-two summer games  back in seventy-two it was the velodrome this week transformed into a spectacular ice facility for these world championships  good evening everyone  welcome back to c b c's continuing coverage  our second night of primetime coverage and tonight should be special  the men get underway in their quest for gold and of course all eyes in canada will be on kurt browning  browning trying to win the gold medal at the world championships for the third year in a row  now remember in addition to browning there are two other men skating for canada in the singles in the original program tonight  they are elvis stojko from richmond hill ontario and browning's edmonton team mate michael slipchuk  no question though the focus tonight in our telecast is going to be the pairs' and the freeskating portion of that event  the reason is isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler are the leaders heading into tonight's free portion   should they win they will join a long and distinguished list of canadian pairs' champions frances dafoe and norris bowden barbara wagner and robert paul of course otto and maria jelinek their triumphant return to czechoslovakia and most recently in nineteen eighty-four in ottawa barbara underhill and paul martini  now speaking of barb and paul they are standing by right now with chris cuthbert  chris  brian we're looking forward to the performance of brasseur and eisler tonight but right now our focus is the men's original program  it seems that so many great champions have had great challengers to push them and that's the case for kurt browning being pushed by viktor petrenko  well certainly everyone knows that this original program  centres around kurt and viktor  technically they are equals  artistically they are opposites  viktor is a strong s classical skater and kurt is the dynamic and exciting skater and if both skaters complete all the eight required elements it's going to come down to a competition between two very contrasting styles  paul kurt isn't the only canadian who could be a factor here  that's right chris  with elvis stojko and michael slipchuk behind kurt browning  we have the potential to match the pairs' performances of last night by putting three men in the top ten which in a field of thirty-four is   gonna going to be quite an accomplishment  it's going to be very interesting and we begin with the first of three canadians michael slipchuk of edmonton crowd cheering   michael is attending his fourth world championships  he's hoping to improve on last year's eleventh place showing in halifax  he also considers himself canada's luck charm  in his three previous worlds a canadian has won the world championship with slipchuk in attendance   michael's first element is his combination the triple axle  double toe   unfortunately it appears from here as though that jump the first one the triple axel was over-rotated  i mean that's one of the more difficult triples to do and it's one that all the top competitors here are trying   no problem with the triple toe   i must say that in michael's four years of attending the world championships his most improved aspect of his skating has been his level of performance  he really goes out there and tries to sell the program get his audience involved and make it look like he's having fun and enjoying his skating  well i think he's really comfortable with this program  it's the second year for this program and it really seems to suit him   stray cat strut he's skating to  aside from his one mistake in his jump combination i thought he did an excellent performance and he looked really comfortable and really covered a lot of ice out there today  i i thought he almost relaxed after the first element was over  he knew he'd missed it but he continued on and he had a great performance after that  michael slipchuk of the royal glenora in edmonton  he was third at the nationals but just getting over a bad case of strep throat  here's a look at the trip axel  he just didn't seem to get all the way around in the rotation   you have   it's unfortunate   you have to remember here that in the short program you have to attempt the element if you wish to get merit for it  so therefore if you don't attempt the second jump even though you've missed the first one in the comp combination  you won't get any marks for it  he said he was about at about  seventy percent in saskatoon but he feels great now  he's had time to get in shape and that should improve his long program from what we saw in saskatoon  well unfortunately with the early draw as well i think the marks are gonna going to be a little bit lower  than we had hoped  and here are the first set of marks for michael slipchuk  there are fives but a four point five from the japanese judge as well as the american judge   he talks it over with his coaches you know mark on the right they haven't caught him on the left  and the presentation marks are higher  five twos and five threes but for the twos i  two scores in the fours from the japanese and american judge once again  right now early in the competition michael slipchuk of canada is in second place   viktor petrenko of the soviet union is getting his last-minute instructions  more from the world figure skating championships in munich  after this tv advertisements   and on this tuesday evening welcome back to the olympiahalle in munich germany  c b c's continuing primetime coverage of the nineteen ninety-one world championship  still to come tonight canadians lloyd eisler and isabelle brasseur go for gold in the pairs  you know whether it's the pairs' or the men's singles  jumping is a very important part of this sport  in tonight's installment of the perfect sixes to explain the evolution of jumping in skating once again here are barbara underhill and paul martini short pre-recorded segment   viktor petrenko of the soviet union is one skater who has taken the art of jumping to new heights  at ice level it almost appears as if he's jumping over the boards  and he is the main challenger for canada's kurt browning  chris i'm extremely excited about this program because viktor has an outstanding history of being a sk consistently short program skater  he's opening with the big combination triple axel  triple toe loop   absolutely gorgeous combination   the next jump will be a trip lutz   perfect   even note the arm position in the landing of that jump  he's got such control out there   viktor attains such clean positions in his spins and it's a nice f feature that he has and not a lot of skaters have   i find that every single move that he makes is a conscious  effort and he knows exactly where his body is at all times  very controlled   chris i thought that's the finest program we've seen here so far in this competition  many people might say that bizet's carmen has been done before  but when you do it like this you got nothing to be ashamed of  well he won the original program in halifax and he certainly has thrown down the gauntlet for kurt browning here  standing ovation and that includes this large contingent of canadians  they love great skating and we've just witnessed it  the thing that is most impressing about this program is the package  from the minute he steps on the ice to the minute he finishes  it's a complete unit  it's what every skater strives for  here's a look at the combination the triple axel triple toe loop  look at the height on that jump  perfectly in control   and the triple toe loop just gorgeous  it had as much flow going in as it had coming out  even the position in the with the  arms and the landing shows such control and such confidence   well there's no doubt these are first place marks and look at them five eights and five nines for technical merit  well this is gonna going to be a really tough program to beat  kurt's really gonna going to have to pull one out out of the hat today  it's interesting though they have left room for kurt  a lot of five eights there  well they must  you must remember that kurt browning is the defending world champion  and the second set of marks the artistic marks five nines a five seven from the canadian judge mary pearson five eights and five nines the rest of the way  undoubtably the best original program we've seen so far  viktor petrenko is the leader   kurt browning is getting his final instructions from coach michael jiranek  the world champion is next when we return to munich tv advertisements segment on coach michael jiranek   well munich is a very special place for michael jiranek  he and his wife renata defected to the west through the bavarian capital and he hopes that kurt browning can create more fond memories this week as the skaters go through their final warm-ups  and barb and paul what an interesting group we have out on the ice  kurt browning todd eldredge elvis stojko of canada and christopher bowman  chris   chris as we watch them warm up i'd like to point out that in the short program there are eight required elements no more no less that must be executed in this program  they include a jump combination the most critical element  which must be any two jumps executed back to back consisting of double or triples however there should not be a step in between  they must do an individual triple jump which must be preceded by some footwork steps a double axel a combination spin a flying spin and another spin of their own creation which must have at least fifteen rotations and two different sequences of footwork  i'd also like to point out that kurt and viktor are virtually equal when it comes to their technical abil  abilities but what the judges are gonna going to have to decide upon is which style they prefer because their styles are completely contrasting  there's christopher bowman  todd eldredge just fell  is is that important this close  i it's something that can rattle some skaters where other skaters will just fluff it off and won't even let it enter their head  now what's in kurt browning's head right now  he knows viktor petrenko has skated a brilliant original program but he also knows that in saskatoon he earns a six for his original program  i think knowing kurt all he's worried about is what his job is and i think we're gonna going to go out   he's gonna going to go out  there and do that job  he looked very good on warm-up  he looked a little tight when he first came out then   and then pulled off a few triple axels and he   he looks to have really relaxed   he's the first skater out   and we are set  canada's top athlete in nineteen ninety  the two-time world champion hoping to three-peat and already the canadian fans are on their feet  he will also be opening with his combination triple axel  triple toe loop   another absolutely gorgeous triple axel triple toe loop combination   the triple flip is the next crucial element   absolutely w the best i've ever seen him execute it   chris it's always so exciting to see two great competitors  like petrenko and browning come out here and lay their best cards on the table  this is what great figure skating is all about  aside from what he does on the ice listen to the ovations  the fans want the sixes might even want nines for kurt browning  but it's that competitive fire along with what he does on the ice that i think makes him stand out  and kurt is always great under pressure  he really pulled this one off today skating right after petrenko  here's a a look at the combination  look at the height right over the boards on the  on the triple axel   great landing straight into the triple toe and another great jump 
Canada	 as you can tell from our replays they're showing a lot of jumps and that's what these men do better than anybody else has ever done before  here's the triple flip preceded by the footwork  nicely pulled out   well there are some great skaters here but  but they say petrenko and browning their jumps really set them apart from the rest  yeah   well the thing to notice is how much flow they have coming in coming out  here are the marks technical marks five eights a five seven from the yugoslavian up to a five nine from the american judge  it will be very interesting to see how they're seeded after this original program  now the artistic marks five eights across the board the hungarian judge a five nine  not enough though and just like in halifax kurt browning  is second in the original program and viktor petrenko of the soviet union will lead after the original   we've seen the soviet champion and the canadian champion  here's the american champion todd eldredge and he could be a wild card in this because   yes chris   todd is a technically strong skater but he sometimes lacks the aggression to really put the program over   had a problem on the landing of the triple axel   it was performed but he did touch down with his hand   very nice triple s jump   he's carried excellent speed through this pair   this combination spin   like petrenko and browning i like the way todd goes out there and interprets his music  he knows his music he's got a a  movement for throughout there's never a dull moment never a stray arm and that's important when you're  gonna going to get into this league of competition  i thought except for the touchdown on the triple axel it was a very strong performance and i think that he will be up  should be up in the top  almost a sense of relief on his face when he was finished  i think uhm his shorts have given some trouble before and  if to get this under his belt has got to be a real confidence booster  here's a look at the triple axel and a little low on the landing but laugh   that hand actually didn't touch down but came within inches of it  nineteen years of age from south chatham massachusetts the two-time american champion  the city was especially proud of his second championship because christopher bowman was there and he still prevailed   he was fifth in halifax and here are the marks for todd eldredge  the first set   five fours five fives five sixes and a five seven from the hungarian judge   and the artistic marks five eight from the german judge five eight from the hungarian judge  those though are third place marks for todd eldridge of the united states  now let's go down to brian williams with kurt browning  interview with browning   welcome back to the olympiahalle in munich  what a group we have seen browning eldredge bowman to come and right in the middle of it is elvis stojko the youngster who will turn nineteen next week from richmond hill and the mariposa club in barrie  as elvis skates i want you to take note of his knees in the landing of his jumps  there are dancers here who would just kill to have knees like elvis stojko   beautiful triple lutz   that was a nice start for elvis   he's preparing now for his combination which will be a triple axel double toe   an unfortunate miss for elvis but i think he's young  he's only at his beginning of his career and i think with some experience under his belt those kind of things are gonna   going to come to him naturally   what i've noticed about elvis this this  year is that he's really improved on his artistry   artistry   he's really worked hard at it and now he's got the jumps and he's also got the package to go with it   aside from the difficulty in the jump combination i thought for elvis it was an excellent outing   he appeared confident covered good ice and finished strongly  i thought all the other jumps he performed were very solid the program was solid and unfortunately there will be a deduction for the triple axel and it'll probably be in the area of about a point five deduction so that'll hurt him a little bit   here's a look at that triple axel   he gets great height   but it unfortunately looked like he just didn't prepare to break out of it soon enough   he looked  yes   he looked over-rotated to me   here's a look at the double axel that he finished with and that was very good and solid and look at those bent knees  now his breakthrough was last year in halifax when he was ninth after being eighth the same year at the world juniors but he seems to relish the role of learning from kurt browning pushing kurt browning and he certainly is the future of canadian skating  well there's nothing to make you want to work harder than  you w when you got someone in your own backyard who's the world champion and it's a real target to shoot for  he's taken the positive approach  viacheslav zagorodniuk of the soviet union who had trouble today  has been criticized for relaxing being number two behind viktor petrenko  now the marks for elvis stojko and the technical marks are low because of the problem  yes i think we see those marks reflect the missed element  and that's what the short program is all about  there is no room for error  well the artistic marks should be much better and here they come and they are much better   up to a five five from the hungarian judge who ranks elvis fourth  overall he will be in fifth place elvis stojko of canada   christopher bowman of the united states is warming up  he's next when we return to munich and more of the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships tv advertisements   the most controversial perhaps the most talked about skater here is christopher bowman of the united states  born in hollywood and i guess his story is potentially a  hollywood script  well chris the controversy has come about because of his move to training under a fellow canadian toller cranston and we're  gonna going to see a really distinct and different christopher bowman out here today  he looked a little bit unsure of himself on the warm-up prior  to to his skate but christopher always seems to be one that can pull it off when it counts   let's see   that was a gorgeous triple lutz jump with a triple toe  it doesn't quite have the difficulty of the combinations that kurt and viktor performed but it was well done   and a very nice triple flip   he's on today   well for christopher i thought it was an excellent excellent performance  he went out there and really moved that program out  that's something he hasn't always done with consistency but he covered a lot of ice especially in his footwork sections and completed every element required to a tee  well it hasn't been easy for toller cranston to make him a more focused athlete but boy the discipline showed today  you could really see the little toller touches throughout the program   it sure is a different christopher then we saw last year at worlds [ 48:30]  well i mentioned the hollywood script because erratic is the best way to describe his career  l last summer at the goodwill games he improvised his whole program and said he skated like a total fool  laugh   here's a look at his triple lutz   very clean   into the triple toe loop   very nice   the one thing with christopher is he doesn't quite have the speed  going into the jumps that viktor and kurt seem to have   here's a look at the triple flip   very nice landing  he gave a performance that made you sit back and go that's the kind of thing that christopher bowman has the potential to do at all times but we haven't always seen it  he was a childhood actor and he has certainly  thickened the plot here at the world championships with the original program   and here are the first set of marks for christopher bowman  up to a five eight   now the marks are are   a little lower than viktor's and kurt's and that's because he performed a combination that was less difficult than they did  he chose to do the triple lutz instead of the triple axel combination  we see him sitting there with ellen burka who is also a reknowned canadian coach  now the artistic marks and they too are impressive  he'll move ahead of his american counterpart todd eldredge and he'll be right behind viktor petrenko of the soviet union and kurt browning of canada  christopher bowman of the united states is third   the last of thirty-four skaters petr barna the czechoslovakian champion and he is a legitimate threat here  chris i h had the opportunity to see him skate from the european championships and i understand he was coming off of an injury then and he looked great then and with the additional time to work on that injury i think we c should expect a good performance here this afternoon   that was a beautiful combination triple lutz triple toe  it doesn't quite have the same difficulty of viktor and kurt's combination but it was a beautiful combination none the less   and a gorgeous triple loop   he's on today   in watching petr i'm impressed by the way he's going out there and he's giving us a performance  he's not just skating an original program he's actually out there selling selling big time   he has a great ability to interpret the music and i think with that he may even break into the top three here  he's having a wonderful performance   an outstanding performance from the last skater of today's competition  it's gonna going to be difficult for the judges because now they're gonna going to have to remember back to whether or not they think this performance is  better equal to or less than that of christopher bowman's  he has brought the fans to their feet here at the olympiahalle   petr barna of czechoslovakia and he has just erased the memory of last year's original program in halifax when he was ninth   he certainly moved up in the long program to fifth overall but this has erased the memory of that poor performance a year ago  well technically he's very equal to the program of christopher bowman  here's the triple lutz triple toe combination which is the same combination that that christopher bowman performed  just a reminder tomorrow night the showdown continues  with kurt browning viktor petrenko and petr barna   and later this evening eisler and brasseur skate for gold in the pairs' competition   and barna and bowman and eldredge all could impact on how the judges decide who will be the champion this year because they could take marks away from petrenko or kurt browning  well i think we're looking at a situation where tomorrow night that last group is just gonna going to bring this house down  we've just seen some examples of skating today that if they all skate up to what they've executed today we're in for an excellent excellent final  he has shown remarkable cool waiting almost two and a half hours to skate  i would like to think that he did not get into this building until this event was at least half over  well here come the marks for required elements  for petr barna  he has been the czech champion since eighty-six and a five three from the yugoslavian judge but the rest of the marks up to five sevens but the crowd not happy with that first set of marks  as barb predicted he has moved ahead of christopher bowman into third place and it's just the sort of thing that he's probably wished for all his life  here are the second set of marks and there's his six from the hungarian judge  the yugoslavian was uh  judge has him five three five three into fifth place but  everyone else liked him  it's proba 
Canada	 i mean if you hit it three quarters and drive it back on  th the those rocks at the back then you're in a lot of trouble  and that's just super control   heidi true to form though is going after it  uhm you know she started this whole end by freezing and uh this is her game plan  this is the way she likes to play it   so new brunswick now lies one   sheri stewart with a nose hit on that stone  okay for b c don they want to hit this rock and roll over into this area here because the way the rocks are sitting now there's a definite pocket for uh new brunswick to freeze to   so they want to get a little bit of movement to this shooting rock of jodie here  they want to roll it away so that there's not a pocket that new brunswick can draw down to   oy   if there's one thing you couldn't do on that out-turn side because it is so unbelievably straight is be that hair wide because it's not going to come back   it's amazing how quickly the whole complexion of the end can change though isn't it   you know that's one advantage of uh   that's a good call heidi  you don't wanna want to be going in around that uh top red one because you may set up a double  do you like the situation as a skip where you ask your third  what shot to play  no way   no way  i mean i like a skip to suggest a shot maybe but never to insist on where they wanna want to play it  you mean a third  a third right   i mean you're the skip you're planning the whole strategy for your last rock whether you wanna want to play the in-turn the out-turn or a draw or a hit so you plan the whole end so why are you asking your third where you want it to put to put it    well kathy floyd did not put that one exactly where heidi hanlon called for   shot stone however still belongs to new brunswick  there is a chance here for jodie sutton if she hits it very very thin she could maybe come off her own and get in for shot rock  hit it very very thin but she's gonna going to  hit it fairly full on the nose  so new brunswick still lies one   well i think if i was heidi hanlon you wanna   want to split the house again i s definitely might go in here  the danger of where she's putting it don in here that if she puts it right there there's a chance for maybe uhm british columbia to make it doubles so she's doing a bit of a gambling here by putting it on that side   if she doesn't put it in perfect and b c makes the double b c is lying three   now she's going to get a rock and a real break  laugh   aw no kidding  that's a good break for her but the bad part is that she's kind of set up a double there a raised back double mind you but there's still an opportunity   now is there any reason she would chose the in-turn rather than the out-turn  no i think she feels more comfortable in the in-turn  because she you heard her l last remarks say it will come up in the end and that's what she wants  but the one thing that she did say is that listen if i just run it off i can always come down with my next shot to those two so she's always playing maybe uh the next shot as well   the in-turn will st still just stay straight whereas the out-turn there will f have a tendency to float back   if they holler yes you know that it's   gonna going to s start to move  she got just one stone but she also opened things up  well that was the idea but if she can make the perfect shot the raised double keel but as long as she made the tat  raised-back and at least got one of them   this will be a remark about the ice that heidi's taking here  that it is well over on the edge of the four play and once you get over that far don that rock is liable to run very very straight as opposed to taking ice closer to the centre line where it will curl   i would not be surprised depending on if heidi hits the broom here uh that this rock stays well in the open and not buried around that corner guard   she let it go uh quite a bit inside the broom i thought   she's almost at the centre line now   it hung on at the back to become second shot   so new brunswick lies two   okay for julie sut sutton  you know interesting enough she's playing the out-turn now on this takeout but the key for julie here is that she wants to hit get  a little action on her shooter over into this area here behind  this corner this uh guard that's at the top of the twelve foot  there is a chance for a double   but you have to be so exacting w to call the rock that you're making contact with   jodie sutton's gonna going to have to watch this rock very very closely coming down the ice to make sure number one that she hits the rock number two that she gets a half of it  enough to get in behind that guard or make the double   she didn't get the roll and now that rock is fully exposed  and there's an opportunity for heidi hanlon with her final stone at this third end to hit and stick and pick up a pair and take the lead  well you know she at the very beginning of this end she decided to gamble and freeze to try and score two points  here she is she has a wide open hit  to score twos so her strategy played off  shot not unlike the one she played last night to win the semi-final against heather houston of thunder bay  oh she's st   that rock's got a lot of curling to do now it's starting to be a  bit of a move  is she gonna going to hang around for two   no   she's only gonna going to score one   so the shooter rolls out of play  the result is a single point for new brunswick on the third end  and after one en or three ends of play this game between new brunswick and british columbia is tied at one general sports wrap-up tv advertisements   welcome back to saskatchewan place in saskatoon  i'm don whittman along with don duguid and colleen jones  you're watching fourth end action in the scott tournament of hearts championship game involving heidi hanlon of new brunswick and  julie sutton of british columbia  this game is tied at a point a piece   b c scoring one in the first the second end was blanked and new brunswick picking up a single point on end three   sherri stewart the second stone for new brunswick is just a wonderful wonderful pillar but for years we've been wondering if she ever does talk  she's very quiet and shy but boy can she curl   she's an experienced competitor  a junior provincial champion in new brunswick in nineteen eighty-three and nineteen eighty-four  she won a provincial women's championship in nineteen eighty-six with grace donald  and of course has competed with heidi hanlon in nineteen eighty-nine ninety and ninety-one at the tournament of hearts   julie sutton indicating to melissa soligo just how far in front of the rings that yellow-handled stone is  well i think maybe uhm julie sutton might look at playing the out-turn as opposed to the in-turn  she's got a lot of room on the right hand side  she can miss that long guard by a foot foot and a half and maybe end up buried  the rock that she's trying to go around belonging to new brunswick is only about a foot in front of the house don so she has to just go by it by a very thin margin to be buried  unfortunately don it again comes down to ice conditions dictating the way you have to play  it won't bend so much on the out-turn and she would've just been in the open as she is going to be anyhow  but uhm coming down on the out-turn around that high corner guard she it won't bury but the in-turn tends to bury better   well if heidi hanlon gets a little bit of a hit and roll on this one to the right-hand side she's gonna going to   be forced to play the out-turn  and i think once you get inside the centre colleen and coming over that hog-line into the house i think it'll move a bit  well it sure didn't for me but i didn't have much luck here this week laugh   laugh   a nose hit  new brunswick lies one   five and six colleen was your record  you got off to a great start winning your first three  what happened over the balance of the week  well one thing that happens now in canadian championships is you have pre-determined last rocks and and uhm   we had we went our first three straight games with wins then the next four games we didn't have the advantage of last rock and we lost all four  and women's curling has improved so much it can come down to who has last rock and we did lose all those games in the tenth or extra ends  competition this is the best scott tournament of hearts field that they've ever had too  the competition is fantastic  b c lies one as that stone delivered by melissa soligo  hangs on for a bite of the twelve  but she has her family here from trail british columbia watching the action   melissa soligo has one bad knee that gives her a little bit of problems from time to time  after she competed in kelowna two years ago she went in for an operation on it and that pretty much tied her up for all of last curling season but she's come back so strongly this year from it all   will kathy floyd make contact with that stone   yes   she never layed a brush to it all the way down the ice though you know how straight it runs there  as soon as kathy floyd let it go heidi hanlon said whoa   you're she's a little bit on the outside  now we'll see whether julie sutton perseveres and plays the in-turn and that's exactly what she's doing   that's   jodie sutton after she won the canadian junior championship a few years ago spent the following year in thailand so took a year off  not much curling over there  laugh exactly but she said it was a marvellous experience   the b c front end has sweeping drills that they practice all year long  they spend thirty minutes working on their sweeping  sweeping down the ice for twenty seconds taking a break for thirty seconds sweeping again for twenty seconds and they do that for a half hour  their sweeping is very strong  well if they want some extra practice i've got an extra long driveway at home they can work on   i've seen that driveway too  i'm not sure that they could handle that one laugh   laugh   b c lies one   it's very very deep in the back twelve foot  the danger here of course is that heidi hanlon uh can ask kathy floyd to come down and hopefully bury behind the guard and keep it in front of the tee-line and if she's a little bit heavy she'll slip and freeze to the line at the back  what she thrown here is a little more than back line  oh yeah   she has a lot of weight   oh and it just hangs on at the back   she nudged the red b c stone out of there and the shooter  hangs for a bite of the twelve foot 
Canada	 kathy floyd you'll hear just whispering  she has a a very bad cold  and it and it might come down to one of those fine calls when a third has to be yelling her lungs out   i think kathy's trying to save it for that moment   now here's the rock inside the centre line and we'll see if it moves   it's starting to come off the line now  it's curling pretty good   it curled too much   that's very much a surprise because it wasn't moving  there like that during the week   i'm really a little bit surprised colleen that julie sutton played a hit on that back one  you know she has last rock the corner guards are up   maybe throw one in around the guard as opposed to hitting on one that's just biting the back of the twelve foot  very good point don but uh julie to true to form has applied what i call the kiss strategy all week and that's keep it simple sweetheart and and it has worked for her  so she perhaps doesn't want to abandon yet what has worked so well for her  the other thing is that julie hasn't thrown that many draws either so perhaps she doesn't quite have the confidence in draw weight yet   not only lots of room but lots of weight  will it come to rest before it slides through  it bumps that stone at the back  new brunswick lies two   see this is a sh thought uh shot  i thought julie sutton would play uh with jodie's last rock  on playing the come-around corner guard   laugh good point julie a bit of backing  there's a fence   this is a classic curling delivery in my opinion   good extension   look how she gets right in behind the rock  maybe uh her wrist is a little bit high which i don't like but  she's right in behind the rock all the time   beautiful curling delivery  she sure doesn't miss much   no line is right  she's a way over on the outside of that centre line   okay for heidi hanlon of course don  the problem is that she comes down here she has to make sure that she hits it either very full or a little bit to the inside and drive it out this way  if she ever hits it three quarters and drives it over here  there's a chance that uh b c may have a chance for two   this looks like a fairly simple shot but it's really not   heidi has a great opportunity here to put some real pressure on british columbia if she can roll behind and sit three  and that's what she trying  this a b   starting to make a move   oi she's got a good looking shot and it's all in her weight  look at this  oh what a beautiful curling shot   just absolutely letter perfect  and now julie sutton is faced with the prospect of drawing the four play with her final stone to score a point  i'm not sure if you can hear poor kathy floyd calling those shots because she's just getting it out  well a great call by kathy floyd  it makes a little bit of a move at the end but look where her shooter rolls to  she makes great contact drives the b c rock out and she rolls perfectly behind the guard biting the four foot   advantage for julie is that she's throwing the same shot she just threw  exactly   okay now soon as she lets it go the brushes will get in there   and make and determine how fast it's going and she's got a lot of weight  she thinks when she released it that she had more weight than with her previous stone   i don't think she's gonna going to  stop in the four foot  is she going to slide through that hole  look at that  no i don't think so  it's coming over just enough to make contact  no just stops the back  but it's a steal of one for new brunswick on end four  so after relinquishing a point on end number one new brunswick comes back with single points on ends three and four  and the score after four ends is new brunswick two british columbia one in the scott tournament of hearts tv advertisments   you're watching sports weekend's live coverage of the scott tournament of hearts from saskatchewan place in saskatoon  new brunswick leading british columbia two one in this championship game as we play the fifth end   no stones in play as new brunswick second sherri stewart  delivers her first stone of this fifth end   all the curlers this week recognize the importance of winning this championship  it's being called kind of the three-in-one championship because  if you win this scott you go on to the world championship in winnipeg and then if you finish in the top six you go on to the olympic games and then of course you get to go back as team canada next year at the scott tournament of hearts in halifax  so it's a huge year for the winner of this one  a major prize or series of prizes awaiting the winner   and i suppose they have all throughout the week attempted to  put those thoughts in the background   well the olympic   but they can't help but be reminded  that's right and the olympic dream was one of the   the reasons why uhm heather houston decided to give it another go this year  she's such a great competitor and uhm she's always there in the end   this is a good shot   an excellent excellent curling shot   melissa put that one directly behind the guard in front of the tee-line  and the interesting thing here for b c don is that they're used to playing the straight takeout game because they normally have control of the game  they're now down one point and gonna going to  have to do a bit of gambling so it's gonna going to be interesting to see how they perform with their shot making  what sherri wants to do here too is to make sure she  misses the professional way  she just doesn't wanna want to go by it all  she either has to get the guard or get that red rock  well that's got   oh she made a good shot  boy let me tell you they're uh they're   playing a very very strong game and you heard heidi yell alright  and i guess that's just s super curling by sherri stewart   and ellen brennan the fifth player for new brunswick just yelled out that that was a six pointer referring to the statistics that curlers are scored every shot is worth four points when they're taking uh  stats but when a sh shot is super you should score five or six  at least according to ellen that was a sixer   we can excuse her for being somewhat prejudiced if she's a little overzealous in her scoring on the shot by  sherri stewart  laugh   and not a bad shot there by melissa soligo  well th the good part about it for melissa is the fact that she hit the word on so now the opportunity presents itself if new brunswick happens to hit and roll out  they'll be able to duck one around that guard again and that's the importance  of hitting and staying in that spot   aw maybe a little bit of a miscall on the sweeping by heidi hanlon there because she was yelling to sweep and they hit it a little bit too thin and rolled into the open   communication between skip and third   is it gonna going to fall out a bit  and julie said it might   which means you cannot afford to throw this rock outside the broom  which obviously jodie has a bit   now the advantage belongs to the new brunswick tweem  team because now they can pull one in around that corner guard   draw weight's been fairly consistent all week except for a couple of games but it's been running about twenty-four and a half seconds which is very very slick   so that's the amount of time it takes for the ice to travel from the hog-line to stop   the rock you mean colleen  that's right and i was just timing that one and it came in at twenty-four point seven to the button  and that's pretty good  that's pretty close  very fast   colleen that that rock has to be removed if anybody's gonna going to score  especially b c  the opportunity for jodie sutton is to play quiet  takeout weight and maybe get a little bit of an inside roll   no move at the end   if anything she rolled just slightly more into the open  now that was the weight that julie sutton wanted jodie to throw on her first rock  she threw a little bit too much weight and it floated out and that's why she rolled off   the nice thing about it for heidi hanlon is that jodie showed her the way down the ice   fairly wide open   a little bit of an inside road roll  for heidi hanlon could prove troublesome for uh julie sutton   i heard her say not much of a handle   it hasn't much m rotation on it  that means at the end it'll really cut   and that rock rolls into the open in the eight foot   one thing i noticed about julie sutton during the week and now in this game here she is very versatile in throwing the in-turn takeout or the out-turn takeout depending on where the ice is  it doesn't make any difference to her   she'd like to take advantage of that long guard   hoping for an inside roll   she has last rock advantage on this fifth end   she's going to roll too far   and now heidi hanlon i'm sure will try and take advantage of that guard  oh no question about it   i mean that was the uh the danger of rolling out and leaving that the opportunity to roll it by that guard or to draw it by that guard  see now that's confidence  she mise might as well take it right to the four foot  she knows she's gonna going to be in the house somewhere  just a question of where the brushers can put it   good strong bushing brushing will bring that rock into the four foot  that's what she's saying   let it go   if she's obviously heavy they won't touch it and they haven't   i think you're right heidi   well by  they never laid a brush to it all the way down the ice and where is it gonna going to stop   it comes to rest at the back of the twelve  new brunswick lies one  well the good part about it for uh heidi hanlon don is that it's behind the guard  it's in the back of the twelve foot  it's gonna going to force b c to take one   and that was their mission too   make british columbia take a point  anytime your opponent has last draw and you force them to take one you've done your job   laugh   laugh   in other words kathy you do the work  laugh   but it's an interesting commentary there from heidi thinking that she has one rock that perhaps is curling a little more and she referred to heather  heather throwed those rocks last night heather houston  and in a couple of instances heathers' seemed to curl quite a bit   well that's a hard thing to determine because it depends how you release them   i mean if she rolls it just a bit it's gonna  going to curl a lot more and if you put it out to the broom  it's gonna going to stay straight  it's nice draw weight by julie sutton   right to the button with the final stone of the fifth end for julie stutton and with that draw by sutton this game is now tied at  two speaker error he says stutton instead of sutton   so at the mid-point of this women's championship at the scott tournament of hearts it's tied at two sports wrap-up   at saskatchewan place in saskatoon after five ends this championship game is tied new brunswick two british columbia two  now let's join colleen jones 
Canada	 starts mid-sentence see a lethbridge power play when we come back  three nothing bears in front  it's golden bear playoff hockey on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight advertisements   alberta golden bears about to face a lethbridge power play   bears touch the puck in their own end and so lethbridge is playing to have the faceoff in their zone but that will not be the case   esposito goes off for roughing at twelve fifty-six   so the pronghorns go on their first power play of the night  they were two for six last night jeff rankin   and this is where you don't wanna want to   see the pronghorns they have they been uh lifeless so far tonight but this is where they could get going  they got some good guys on the p p  harper skates it in across the line knocked down

the coach of lethbridge talkin' talking about how he liked the increase of forechecking and uh just before that uh call on frank esposito that was their first shift in this whole hockey game and that they did some good forechecking and then they had the bears hemmed up in their own end for a minute and a half there and uh  but other than that there's there's only snow on the one end cos that was their only shift of the hockey game so far  yeah the zamboni was not getting much in the way of work down in by dale masson   well we'll see what happens here as the pronghorns work on the power play

came on the power play  and the bears kill off the first power play for lethbridge uh  not without uh excitement for the crowd  and uh this has been uh just carryover from last night  some great hockey being played  dale's in on the faceoff in his own zone  glad you could be along for this one   on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight point five i'm evan bok along with jeff rankin   should there be a game three tomorrow we're on with our pregame at seven o'clock once again   from the clare drake   degner will faceoff now against tyler graham   graham won it back  back to the point  leroux shot gets through  saved by masson  gave up a big rebound but he gloves a shot by graham  and looks like a penalty coming up   and i believe it's against the bears again  a   and a good penalty there  terry degner he he uh lost  th the draw got lost sorry by dean tiltgen  degner had his guy and his guy just got away from him a bit  the rebound came right to him and degner hadda   had to do sump'in something   or the or a guy's all alone in in  the slot by himself and uh  if there is a good penalty that's one because uh degner took away a good scoring chance   terry degner for holding in sixteen thirteen  so he has a goal and a penalty too now   thirty uh three forty-seven to go in the first period  and the pronghorns will go on their second power play of the night  bears are in front   protecting a three nothing lead   aaron zarowny will take the faceoff against zukiwsky   horns won it  reider back to the point to kelln  back to reider   reider's pass was blocked and aaron zarowny clears it down the ice  jarret zukiwsy likes to stand right on the doorstep of masson   try and get in his way  that's his job a of course  long lead pass to gatto  gets it in to reider  he moves in shoots  saved by masson  but it's offside   that was a good call for the bears  i'm not sure about that one uh   jarret zukiwsky again complaining to the ref  uh the good news for the bears is they've gone four periods and the only goal zukiwsky's scored was a cheesy one   but i guess the bad news is i is   he gonna going to break out and start potting  'em them right 'n' and  left because uh he's a prolific goal-scorer and uh the bears just  gotta got to keep doing a good job on 'im  him like they have   coach daum sends out aaron zarowny gainst  against simpson   troy hjertaas trevor sherban to defend this horn power play   and harper has it off the draw at centre ice for lethbridge  over to kelln  now ahead to reider  he's squashed by trevor sherban and the bears clear down the ice  sherban walked up on that play and let 'im  him have it   good hit again  the bears' physical presence has been the best all year tonight  here's harper with it from his own end  skates to centre  lead pass to zukiwsky   he knocked it down but simpson got to it and hammered it the length   a minute ten to go in the pronghorn power play   here they go  kelln ahead to zukiwsky  splits the defence  moves in  saved  masson  what a nice stop that was   they made the blocker save  and there it was  zukiwsky  they they uh  a set play  a beautiful pass  put the deke all alone  and there comes dale masson  he's not the best goalie in the league for nothing and uh   big save for 'im him cos uhm   a goal in the last three minutes would get the pronghorns right back in this hockey game  beautiful stop off the leading goalscorer in the canada west this year  and the last three   jarret zukiwsky   that's what ya you like to see a showdown between the top members of this league   ya you had it right there and dale masson robbed him   and if you wanna want to watch a power play breakout you wanna want to watch that last one  you have that one taped could be 'on tape'  cos that one was uh pretty to watch  esposito against zukiwsky on the faceoff  a minute one to go on the power play  here's a long blast  saved masson  a nice glove stop that time off of jeremy riehl  and jarret zukiwsky in there paying the price in front of the net   hm   he's paying a price but if you're playing to the referee every time  if you're gonna going to go there you're gotta got to pay the price and   look j hopefully mccory gets tired of this  i mean you can't whine to the ref if you're gonna   going to go to the net every play  you don't book a room in a five-star hotel and then  complain cos it costs more than a one-star  there you go   that's the best i could do without mentioning names  you know   laugh i don't want any lawsuits   not bad at all not bad at all   hello in sarcastic voice   two and a half to go in the first   three nothing  the bears in front of the horns   horns still in the power play  riehl fires it deep into the zone  pullishy checked by zukiwsky  o'rourke comes up with it  behind the net   looking for someone to pass to   to the right circle it goes to riehl  back to the point  it comes out to centre ice   riehl has it there   flips it deep into the bears' zone  masson sets it up for goodkey behind the net  goodkey takes the hit  lost the puck  gatto has it   gatto out front for riehl  his blast  wide of the net   o'rourke behind the net now  for gatto  nine seconds left in the power play  gatto steps out  back to the right point for riehl  his shot   deflected wide of the net   o'rourke is hit hard by pullishy  it ends up underneath o'rourke   and zukiwsky comes in and lays the body on pullishy and that'll do it   as degner steps out of the box we have a minute forty-five to go in the first period and uh fans here give the bears a rousing applause laugh   i thought they were going to anyways  some of them were  the uh p 
Canada	 he's third   and so the final standings after the men's original program viktor petrenko of the soviet union leads kurt browning petr barna is third  and what a day for the canadians elvis stojko's seventh michael slipchuk is eighth tv advertisements   petr barna brings the men's original program to a spectacular close  the event had everything we expected and maybe a little bit more  well the top four finishers this afternoon really made this a very exciting event and as we all expected the top two finishers  viktor petrenko and kurt browning  now the judges seemed to prefer petrenko's style over browning's  however that is irrelevant because going into the long program any one of the top three men can win  and we all must remember that this is the exact same position kurt is sitting in that he was in last year when he defended his world title  paul kurt browning happy with where he stands  so are the other two canadians  chris the top four were not the only ones to enjoy outstanding performances s today  our canadians michael slipchuk and elvis stojko also gave  outstanding performances although they had some minor problems in their original programs they are sitting in an excellent position going into tomorrow night's long program which has all the makings of being a classic  it certainly does  we look forward to that  and when we return we'll have the pairs free skate this evening  as eisler and brasseur skate for gold  that's when we come back to the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships from the olympiahalle here in munich tv advertisements   and we welcome you back to the olympiahalle in munich germany  c b c's continuing prime time coverage of the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships  and just a reminder still to come this evening isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler go for gold in the pairs competition  they are the leaders heading into tonight's pairs free program  and again that is yet to come in tonight's telecast  judging is a very important and i don't have to tell you people extremely controversial part of this sport  to explain more about judging and just how it works in figure skating here is one of canada's international judges jean senft  segment on judging techniques   well i certainly don't envy the task of the judges having to decide between kurt browning and viktor petrenko  there's such a fine line between the two  but now let's turn our attention to the pairs competition  because it could be an historic night for lloyd eisler and isabelle brasseur  well we're all hoping it'll be a great night for lloyd and isabelle and they are more confident than ever going into this long program this evening and i also think that they have the strongest  program here tonight and and if they hit it i think there's no problem they can win it  chris i thought the strength of the pairs event was evident last night when christine hough and doug ladret made one mistake  but as a result find themselves in tenth place going into this long  the biggest surprise of the evening was perhaps stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier who put in an excellent outing and as a result find themselves in eighth place going into tonight's long program  brasseur and eisler will skate last tonight  right now we join hough and ladret next thirty seconds untranscribed: audio cuts out   the next element the side-by-side triple toe loops   they both have a little bit of trouble on it but nevertheless it s doesn't upset the flow of the program too badly at all   christine had a problem with the landing of the throw double axle  i'm surprised  she usually does that element perfectly   chris there's a situation where you're attempting a very difficult element at almost the four minute mark of a program  and i have to wonder if they couldn't have placed that element a little bit earlier when they went in a little bit fresher and had a better chance of executing it   barb in watching christine did you get the feeling that she really wasn't on top of those throws   i really did paul but i also think that this was very difficult for them tonight coming off such a a a  disappointing short program last night  it almost reminds us of it it  it almost reminds me of us in sarajevo   well the canadian fans throwing flowers on the ice for christine hough and doug ladret who are sixth in halifax they're tenth here and certainly will not be able to achieve the same success as last year at the world championships  but she certainly lives up to her nickname tuffy   as barb mentioned when you come into an event such as this   having as they have placed sixth last year you've got a goal of at least attaining that if not something better and it really does tend to take the wind out of your sails when you don't have a short program that goes as well as you'd like  here's a look at the throw triple salchow   christine just looked very far forward on the landing and couldn't hold it   i did wanna want to mention that  last night you mentioned the comedic short program  it went over very big with the british who were raving about it and i was interested that the british judge marked them so much higher than the rest  obviously it struck a chord with the british sense of humour and tonight they showed their versatility in another way  well i thought this was a very nice program  it suited doug and christine a lot  i just think that once they get the elements and the program together they're gonna going to have a great package  they were the national champions in eighty-eight second in canada in nineteen ninety and ninety-one   and the first set of marks   low fives four nine from the german judge four eight from the judge from japan   and now the marks for artistic impression   all fives five ones and five twos  the japanese judge a four point nine   so christine hough and doug ladret are currently in second place trying to stay in the top ten   the young canadians stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier are next when we return to the ninety-one world's in munich after this tv advertisements   here are our surprising canadians  eighth place stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier   just talked to jean-michel a few minutes ago and he says he's nervous  when they came they had nothing to lose but all of a sudden they're in the top ten and maybe could move up  well they have a very dynamic opening planned   they're gonna going to open with a triple twist following it with a throw double axle into side-by-side double axles   well barb they hit two of those three big elements  he seemed to have a little bit of trouble with the double axle of his own but the first two elements were most impressive   the next move they're preparing for is the throw triple salchow and they chose to do a double   because of the fact that this team is very close in height they are able to com create some natural leg lines but i would like to see them actually go home and work a little bit on their unison  they seem to lose it at times and they need to be more aware  of where each other is at all times   as i watch them skate i can't help but notice that they do have something going for them which is very important and that's stacey's  attitude  she's out there smiling having a great time and it comes through and makes you feel comfortable with the team and it shows confidence  well i think they were they were   surprised to even be here at the world championships  i think they put on a great performance for their first world's  it really is fun to watch a couple of young skaters emerge here and they really did seem relaxed on the ice despite what jean-michel told us before-hand  and even with the one mistake one thing you have to remember that one element a program does not make  i've seen a lot of people win titles and have a mistake and i think that's something we all skaters should remember  cos look at their triple twist   a little tight on the landing but it was landed very clean  stacey seventeen years of age  jean-michel's twenty   what we're seeing here is the missed element but i  i have to admit barb that trying to do what they're attempting here is indeed very very difficult  it is very difficult  stacey had no problem with her double axle   i think jean-michel was just a little bit out  out of position going into his  there's their coach jos&eacute;e picard and she seemed delighted  stacey's still got that smile on her face   of course jos&eacute;e also coaches brasseur and eisler  here come the marks for ball and bombardier  the first set of marks five twos and five threes  canadian fans would've like to've to have   seen a little higher  i think the reason why we're seeing these marks is because  some of their pair moves just do not have the difficulty that those above them have  and that's something that's only gonna going to  come with experience  as well i think they need a chance to develop more as a team instead of two individual skaters and i think that will come with time  marks for artistic impression five ones up to five fours   and so stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier right now in third place   later eisler and brasseur skate for gold as c b c's coverage of the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships continues tv advertisements   in contention for a medal here from the united states the american champions  fourteen-year-old natasha kuchiki and todd sand a twenty-seven-year-old  they're both from california  i think they're probably very surprised to be sitting in fourth place right now but there's no pressure on  on them here  they can just go for broke   they'll be opening with side-by-side double axles   that was interesting barb in that he had landed the jump and then appeared to have the difficulty   triple twist had a little little   bit of a hard time getting around but it was landed   that was a nice throw triple loop  she did touch down on the ice but it was a landed throw   todd and natasha had a a disastrous showing at the u s nationals and i think they remember that and so they're just going out here and they're they're   giving it all they've got   although this team has not been together very long they are developing a nice rapport between themselves and that probably has a lot to do with their coach john nicks who did coach nineteen seventy-nine world champions tai babilonia and randy gardner   nice throw triple salchow and very late in the program  i really notice that there tends to to   be a lot of distance between the two skaters on their individual jumps but i think that's something that they're gonna   going to grow with and something that they're  gonna going to they're gonna  going to learn over time   i was impressed by the strength with which they finished this program   todd has had a history of back problems which i know has interrupted their training schedules at various points and a skate this strongly i think is a sign of two really determined individuals   before the competition and you can see the americans are delighted with the performance of this pair he said he felt that in the near future they might be ready to contend for medals but i don't think he anticipated they'd be this close this soon   no i think it was a present not 'pleasant' surprise that they placed as high as they did after the short  as you can see he is extremely pleased with the performance and they have every right to be   very few mistakes and a nice strong finish   i was especially impressed with where they put in that throw triple salchow   just look at the double axles  you can see they are quite far apart 
Canada	 he lands low and touches the ice but he manages to keep to stay on one foot there   and this was the second double axle that they tried and this one was much nicer  very nice unison on that   natasha was the youngest competitor last year in halifax at age thirteen   both her parents are skaters  her father a former japanese national champion  and here are the first set of marks   five fives for the most part a five four from the japanese judge up to five sevens for kuchiki and sand of the united states  now the artistic impressions and you can hear their coach  congratulating them  there they are five fives five sixes sevens and a five four again from the japanese judge   so right now kuchiki and sand of the united states are the leaders   they ensure themselves of at least a fourth place finish  still ahead brasseur and eisler's main rivals the european champions mishkutenok and dmitriev when we return to munich and the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships tv advertisements   welcome back to munich and here are the main challengers for brasseur and eisler  the european champions natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev  if you saw our show from sofia you know their long program is a beautiful one  it is and you're gonna going to see a real contrast in styles between this program and lloyd and isabelle's  this is elegant and beautiful whereas lloyd and isabelle's will be powerful and dynamic   and they open with two gorgeous side-by-side triple toe loops  and a beautiful triple twist  it doesn't quite have the height of lloyd and isabelle's but it was beautiful nonetheless   and here's the throw triple toe   this is a very good opening for them   barb what really impresses me with this team is that there's never a dead spot  every step every arm movement flows into the next  it's like perpetual motion  it's just beautiful to watch it flow across the ice   nice   they are on tonight   chris you had the opportunity to watch this team at european's  i sense tonight a much more aggressive pair of skaters out there as though they really want this title   paul although they won the european's with their long program there was a mistake in sofia but this has been virtually flawless  as you can see natalia has unbelievable flexibility and th they're able to come up with some really interesting moves because of that flexibility   they're already getting on their feet here in munich   an absolutely outstanding performance  this crowd is on its feet   they have come to skate tonight and they've put on a show  that is gonna going to have to be topped by isabelle and lloyd by one of at least equal calibre and determination  i don't know about you but that ending just gave me the chills  it was just beautiful  natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev perhaps the loudest ovation we've heard so far   the whole look was just fabulous  the skaters it almost looked like they could feel each string as it was played by the orchestra  they just worked it for all they had in them   apparently they don't give out standing ovations in the soviet union but this pair earned one at the national championships this year  well the long program carries the most weight so the pressure will be on brasseur and eisler  here's a look at their double axles   very nice   marks for technical merit   a five seven from the japanese judge the rest are five eights and the crowd is unhappy   well they have to remember that the current leaders are yet to skate so they have judges have to leave themselves some room at the top if they r skate well enough to be awarded first place marks   here are the second set of marks  they have to leave room  they have but not much  look at those five nines  lloyd   lloyd and isabelle will have to put on the performance of their life this evening to beat this performance  the soviets have certainly put the pressure on brasseur and eisler  the canadians skate in quest of their first world title when we return to munich after this tv advertisements pre-recorded segment on brasseur and eisler   well here they are   an unlikely union a couple of years ago as their coach josee picard explained last night   isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler skating for their first world title but they know the task at hand  well i think they know that thore they're  going to need to perform a very clean performance this evening   she just gave him a big smile as if this is gonna   going to be a piece of cake   look on this side-by-side double axles   and they nailed them   great   barb i thought that was as great an opening as any pair we've seen here tonight   an absolutely gorgeous one arm press star lift   and of all the men skating here watch lloyd eisler's feet  he has by far the cleanest feet of any man skating in this competition   one more very difficult element the throw triple salchow   beautiful   they're one minute away   barb i don't know about you but i think i can remember the feelings that they're feeling right now   laugh   i don't think they could have possibly skated any better this evening   there were moments out there where they just knew they were on they knew it was gonna going to be a happening and they put it down  this building has exploded   it's in the judges hands now but that looked like a gold medal skate  as that program went along i felt they got more confident skated stronger and just put on a absolutely outstanding performance  probably the best of their lives   well lloyd's dad has just continued the tradition of sending the hat out onto the ice   number one ranked coming in and we'll find out if that's the way they leave   here's a look at the side-by-side double axles   a crucial mo   paul i can't believe we missed this  lloyd did a single axle  barb i don't know about you but i'm always so busy watching isabelle do her jumps cos she's the one who usually has the  difficulty with them   well i i'm sure that everyone in this arena was watching isabelle including us   now i don't know if this is gonna going to  make the difference in this program or not but   here we're looking at a split triple twist  nice height on this twist but i i  just can't believe we missed that element   well there's not much room for error because mishkutenok and dmitriev were virtually perfect  and they were also very strong on their individual jumps  so this could mean the difference  you can hear the marks being announced and there they are  the first set five sevens five eights and one five nine from the polish judge   this is going to be very close and i'm not sure they have enough  the artistic marks should be higher   here they are   two five nines the rest are five sevens and five eights  it's not enough  chris you're right there just i isn't enough marks there to put them into first place  i mean i don't think that they could've skated any better  they did an absolutely excellent performance aside from that axle  but i guess maybe that was the difference  well isabelle not showing any disappointment on her face   oh you wonder about lloyd's bad knee  he will undergo surgery in june to repair the ligaments in his left knee  that hockey mishap in the holidays over christmas   it's rather stunning because they ignited this building only to finish second  we'll be back with the medal presentations after this tv advertisements   welcome back to the olympiahalle in munich for the medal presentation for the pairs competition  it was not gold for isabelle brasseur and lloyd eisler of canada  for the seventh consecutive year a soviet pair has won the  world championship  what a performance by natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev as they edge out brasseur and eisler for the gold medal  and a surprise bronze medal performance by the americans  natasha kuchiki and todd sand  olaf poulsen the president of the international skating union  presenting the gold medals to mishkutenok and dmitriev   interesting that isabelle as soon as she got off the ice and heard the marks she said well we'll get them in albertville   she can take some consolation  her teammates in boucherville stacey ball and jean-michel bombardier did a wonderful job in their first world championships placing eighth  christine hough and doug ladret the other canadian pair placed eleventh   but this day belonged to the soviets natalia mishkutenok and artur dmitriev they are the world champions for nineteen ninety-one   it's tied at two  so far neither side has been able to score more than a single point  b c getting singles on the first and fifth end  the second end was blank  new brunswick with single points on the third and fourth ends  once again here's colleen interview with julie sutton   julie sutton of british columbia and heidi hanlon of new brunswick all even after five ends of play  elaine jackson the fifth member and coach of the b c team talking with the rink   and ellen brennan in a similar role with the new brunswick champions   well very shortly we'll see whether the strategy pays off in the second half of this game  the score after five is two two  you are watching the scott tournament of hearts live on sports weekend tv advertisements   well don duguid through five ends of play here at saskatchewan place in this scott tournament of hearts final anything  you've seen that might cause you to think that one side or the other has a bit of an edge  well no it's very very close don but uh you heard hei  uh heidi hanlon say uh you know i always play better in the back part of the game  uh she's curling about eighty-eight percent now and if she gets any better than that it's gonna going to  be very difficult for julie sutton  laugh   well julie sutton as we heard in her conversation with elaine jackson indicated that she was going to try and play that centre guard game  well i think she's gonna going to  have to you know  she struggled with her draw weight a bit but the last draw in the fifth end she put it right on the button and that's got to give her a lot of confidence so now that she's got her draw weight i think sh  you'll see her do a bit more gambling  do you think as this one gets down to the closing ends that experience may be an advantage  i really think so you know  this is very tricky ice but uh the big thing and it's  gonna going to come down to last rock i think and it depends who has last rock in the tenth end  well it's all tied at two after five ends of play  colleen  well the ice is working well for a little bit of a come-around game so teams are going to be able to start taking chances  just eavesdropping to the team meetings a little bit we heard julie saying we're going to play a tight guard   she doesn't want it too far out there because that's gonna  going to give new brunswick the opportunity to come in and around  we also heard heidi and her team saying we're great second half players   even though they played well these first five ends they even think they can play better  they also like the fact that they haven't allowed julie and company to play that wide open kind of a game   well new brunswick has the edge in team percentage  they are curling at eighty-three percent as opposed to seventy-four percent for british columbia   we talked earlier about the differences in the brooms the women are using   we talked about the design of the broom that the  sweepers for b c use  that's an al carlson design   the husband of pat sanders who was a provincial and world curling champion a few years ago  and with that bend in the broom don it is a little easier on the wrist and the women are able to get more pressure on the brushing hand 
Canada	 recording starts mid-sentence whole bunch a  of guards on the right hand side  no way   they're now playing the split     it's over curling  it's curling and is it heavy   oh boy   oh boy   oh boy   oh that is not a good shot   a reprieve for british columbia   oh   that may be the biggest break in the curling game   not only was it a bad call but a very bad shot     exasperated breath, like a horse snort   the only thing that can save heidi hanlon now is if julie sutton hits and rolls out and maybe she can get in around those corner guards   how the emotions change  a moment ago jodie sutton was so upset with her shot now she's relieved because kathy floyd was upset with her shot   oh yes   this is where pressure comes into the game of curling   there's that roll you suggested was there but it's just a little too far  well that was not even a good curling shot don because  you have to play that rock to maybe hit and roll to the left hand side   take the play away from those corner guards and especially by rolling out   now you're gonna going to give heidi hanlon the opportunity to draw round these corner guards   see if they had've drawn to the open side don and julie sutton hit and rolled out they woulda would have just had a simply uh straight draw to split the house   it's the big shot for heidi   and they're gonna going to have to go hard on it to get it by the guard  and it's got kind of a lazy handle on it  that's my impression it's got very very little turn on it  now when you have a rock with very little turn it's gonna  going to just come off of the side  look at that   i mean it just takes the contour of the ice and goes right over  so now julie sutton who was ready to concede a single point on this tenth end and play for victory on an extra end has a chance to perhaps steal a point and win the game  she is going to try and get in behind those corner guards   well everything's worked out for julie this end   stopwatch in hand   watching her sister release the rock   hmm sh   she's got lotsa lots of room and  lotsa lots of weight   oh she's got a great curling shot   they gotta got to take it deep deep  deep   so now if you're heidi hanlon the pressure is on your shoulders because you must draw and catch a piece of the eight-foot  if you're to prolong this match and force an extra end   well they shoulda should've really been on that rock a little bit earlier because they could've maybe pulled it into the eight-foot   but the nice feeling is is that the other skip has to make the shot  simply to tie the game   hanlon wasted very little time in moving to the far end to  deliver this final stone of the tenth   oh how is it for distance  oh it's got something   unclear words   it's picked up something don   oh what a way to lose the game  look at that rock take off sideways   yeah   it's got a hair underneath it   oh what a way to lose a curling game  what a tough break for heidi hanlon and her new brunswick rink  and what a great win for julie sutton of british columbia   aw the game of curling was very cruel to heidi hanlon today  elaine jackson out there to congratulate the four members of this championship squad  julie and jodie sutton melissa soligo and karri willms  well they are deserving champions  trailing by three with three ends remaining   they stole two on the ninth end   and picked up a single point on the tenth  and they win it by a score of seven to five   tears of happiness for julie sutton jodie sutton melissa soligo and karri williams speaker error, should be willms the nineteen ninety-one canadian women's champions advertisements   a tough way to lose for heidi hanlon with her final stone picking up a hair but a great win for julie sutton and her british columbia team mates  the nineteen ninety-one canadian women's champions winning the  scott tournament of hearts here at saskatchewan place interviews and comments - - post game wrap up   i thought last night in the overtime before the pronghorns did win it that they looked tired and the bears were taking the play and  and you looked at th this last shift zukiwsky and gatto are both out there for two and a half three minutes  and in a three game series that's going to take your legs out of you in three days and uh  ah it could be the difference for the bears or not  tomorrow   well there were games during this season when there was a five-minute major and zukiwsky played the whole  five minutes   that's right   that's right  so maybe he can do it  but over three games in three days it's gonna  going to to be tough  strap a nu ninety-nine on his back if he's  gonna going to do stuff like that   puck at centre ice  christiansen has it for alberta  gets it ahead to esposito  esposito has a pair a of goals here tonight and he rifles it in across the line   deep in the horns' zone  leroux has it behind the net  he goes down   ends up underneath haney  haney has it  in the left corner  works it up the boards to strand  to the point for christiansen  his shot blown wide of the net   comes off the boards and carpenter has it there  wants to play it ahead to kita   carpenter instead weaves through traffic  dipsy-doodles and sends it in across the bear line  minute to go in the first period  christiansen has it behind the net   plays it ahead   and esposito lifts it high in the air and down the ice back to play  to harper   bears change 'em them up  tiltgen degner thompson out there   the forward unit hjertaas and trevor sherban on defence  and lethbridge able to clear   sherban'll lift it right back in  deep to the corner   harper back to play it  tiltgen in to forecheck  harper has it  plays it ahead to graham  that's broken up   it bounces at the side of the net  krooshoop has it  drops it off for harper  bears pen 'em them in pretty well  up the right side it goes to burns   burns plays it   that's off a bear and out to centre   trevor sherban plays it again for dean tiltgen and he'll just lift it deep into the zone   back to play it's harper  ten seconds left in the first period  harper plays it off the wall and down the ice   trevor sherban plays it into the penalty bench  three seconds to go  he sent the one of the penalty box attendants ducking   you gotta got to keeep alive down there   one of   get those uh cages on like they do in the spectrum  laugh   one of the big differences tonight evan is the forecheck for the bears  last night we commented on how good the pronghorns were breaking out of their own end and   we just saw this in the last three minutes and they couldn't make a pass to save their life  the other thing too is on this last series it  kinda kind of i think amplifies what's happened in the first  trevor sherban able to dump it deep in the lethbridge territory  make 'em them start out deep in their own end unclear word   make 'em them turn and go to their own corner and put it safe against the glass  the whole night  period's over  three nothing   the alberta golden bears in front of the lethbridge pronghorns  bears outshot the pronghorns sixteen eleven in that first period  quickly here's what happened in it  frank esposito opened the scoring the five thirty-three mark  with a delayed penalty   and paul strand let the shot go  esposito cashed in on the rebound  merv haney got an assist as well  unclear words goal at five fift  five thirty-three one nothing   then on the power play frank esposito won a faceoff   haney got it over to strand who passed it out front to esposito his second of the game and of the playoffs at eight twenty-five two nothing  then at nine twenty-eight terry degner his second of the playoffs  he scored last night   as he tipped a mike thompson shot from just inside the blue line past goaltender cavilla  hal christiansen got an assist there as well  three nothing after the opening period of play general hockey discussion, hockey news round up, advertisements and interview for next 15 minutes, 50 seconds   alberta golden bears up three nothing on the lethbridge pronghorns as referee george mccory gets set to toss the puck in to start the second period  frank esposito paul strand and merv haney will begin this  second period   and we look down at the bench i do not see mike jickling   and i don't know if we asked what his situation is whether we'd get an answer or not  these are the playoffs jeff so they  kinda kind of keep those things quiet  you don't wanna want to g    that's right  you're not gonna going to give away anything uh   unclear word the coaches have had to deal  with their play it's gotta got to be hurting without mike jickling now  strand over to pullishy  back over to goodkey   and it's cleared down the ice as the second period's underway  here come the horns at centre   with the puck is wobick   long shot glove save made by masson  he'll hold on  that was a long shot by wayne filipenko from well outside the blue line and dipped a little bit on masson  he had to reach out with a trapper and make the stop   and he has had a lotta lot of  action tonight  he's made a coupla couple of good saves but he does look sharp   uh no rebounds no bobbles and no hesitations on that uh   skipped goal  last night he hesitated and it cost him and   he's looking good  and a brilliant stop on zukiwsky in that end  last night   that's right   that's right  great great stop   and on the power play   esposito facing off against bannerholt   comes back to the left point  here's a shot by wobick  doesn't get through   the bears are able to clear  strand checked by wobick   it's cleared deep into the bears' zone again  and it's goodkey turns from behind his net over to pullishy and the bears  esposito to haney  long lead pass on the right side to strand  he's gotta got to step in on the right wing  let's a shot go and he whistled it wide on the blockers' side  esposito has it   to the corner for haney  haney out front comes back to the point  hjertaas with a chance  he'll send it to the corner it's knocked down however by riehl  and here come the horns in a three on two   riehl sends it to the corner for filipenko   they centre out front  that's unclear word away and a good play  good defensive play by strand  it comes out to centre ice   bears have it   sherban skating it down the right wing  sherban steps in across the line   takes a look sends it stop lead to the corner  in behind the lethbridge net   aaron zarowny was checked  simpson chasing after the puck against rieder  rieder has him all tied up   and here come the horns   leroux was spun around then gave aaron zarowny a little bit of a shave with that stick   zarowny with the puck  over to colin zaronwy  now behind the net for simpson  walking out front  tried to set it up for hjertaas who'd moved in   and one of the horns falls on top of the puck to negate that scoring opportunity  but the bears starting off well here in the second period  they're up three nothing  and once again uh law firm as you'd name them with a good nickname they own the pronghorns  the puck did not get outta out of the pronghorns' end  uh they cycle the puck  they're all very smart hockey players  they don't make dumb plays they don't take stupid chances and   e they're just a solid line  zarowny zarowny and simpson the law firm 
Canada	 that's right  they put all of their weight so that they're not just down one straight line so the it's a little bit offset  and it allows them to get their wrist and it's easier on their wrist  and that brush gets very very heavy don  i tried it when the girls were practicing one afternoon and it is very very heavy compared to an ordinary brush   and jodi sutton the b c third also uses that brush when she throws a stone  the others go to the more conventional straight handled brush when they deliver a rock   okay now the importance of a lead  you heard julie sutton talking with our colleen jones that she wants to play a tight guard so this'll be a sign of a good lead  a tight tight guard   let's see how close she is to making this shot   karri willms now that was   was almost perfectly  now how's that for accuracy   now that's tight  that's about two inches away from the top of the word  now that's tight enough eh colleen  that is very tight laugh   sh heidi's gotta got to hit it  but she can roll on here   yeah but maybe a fraction too close to the circles  because it allows new brunswick maybe to hit and roll into the rings  it changes the whole complexion of the end   mary harding gets a nose hit on that b c stone  we mentioned earlier that she has only been curling for six years  she did not take up the sport until she was thirty and it was kathy floyd who convinced her to participate in the sport of curling   you have to admire uh julie sutton skip of the british columbia rink  two years ago in kelowna she was skipping what was considered by many to be a dream team with former world champions pat sanders and georgina hawkes on the team o as well as melissa soligo and  julie got off to a little bit of a rough start  she was bumped down to second stone   and that might have shattered s a person's confidence but she bounced back from that and uh is just stronger than ever   another thing the b c rink has going for them aside from being teammates they are such close friends  three of them melissa and julie and jodi all live together so there's no escaping each other   well they certainly do spend a lot of time together   about one hundred games this rink has played this year   they won the final in salmon arm when they were one down  with last rock coming home they scored two to defeat kerrylynn richard of kelowna in that final game   mary harding delivers her stone to the twelve foot   new brunswick lies one   that's the stone that julie sutton has asked melissa soligo to remove   oh she might've missed this one   aw   not enough to get it out of the rings  don i actually think she touched that corner guard and just  straightened the rock up enough to make contact with that rock at the back   the opportunity now exists for new brunswick to put two rocks into the house and two points in this particular point in the game  is very very large   this is the toughest shot in curling don a draw to the outside  cos you're going in an area where not too many rocks have been played it's a little bit heavier and not only that you're going against the circles  you're running out of the house to draw to  look at that  that's perfect don  that's beautiful curling  sherri stewart places that stone in the twelve  new brunswick lies two   don after five ends sherri stewart is curling ninety-three percent   another perfect shot there   melissa soligo at eighty-five percent   is she a little inside again   yes she's going to wreck out front but she does catch a piece  of that shot rock  she was a little fortunate there  she wrecked on the guard but caught a piece of that new brunswick stone and was fortunate enough to remove it  well if she hits that rock that guard a little bit thicker she rolls right out of play and then new brunswick s has a free draw for it to lie three   a little bit of a break but that's part of the game of curling   if there's one thing you have to go have going for you they are the breaks  i was talking to julie earlier in the week and there were four games during the round robin even though she only lost one but there were four other games that she even admits she could have and perhaps should have lost but she got the break in that last end when the other skip would miss or   this may be a break for b c   it just slides through the rings   and now julie sutton can focus her attention on that stone at the back of the twelve   the sutton twins were telling me they can remember going uh to the curling club as kids with their parents and they knew they were taking the game seriously when their parents lost in a mixed game and they went into the washroom and cried their eyes out for their parents'  losses   jodi sutton catches a corner of that new brunswick stone at the back of the twelve   heidi hanlon is going to persist in keeping the play over on the right-hand side of that twelve-foot ring  well that's what she wants to do you know and uh i think uh heidi uh feels that the b c team is really not overpowering them with their great takeout ability cos they have just touched uh three rocks  and not only that the reason she's playing over there don that's where she wants to play because she has last rock but there's a rock just outside the rings and that may act as a little bit of a uh protection for her  maybe b c will drive it on to that one at the back and that's why she's playing over there as opposed to playing it in the open side  well for that portion of the twelve-foot circle this new brunswick team has weight down perfectly   now there have been two takeouts down there   both by melissa soligo and they really made a move at the end don so i'm sure that's going through jodi sutton's mind that melissa may throw in at pretty well up the broom and they really curl so she's   gonna going to have be very conscious of her weight here   keep her weight up cos ya you know the rock's gonna going to curl at the end   wanna want to make sure they don't drive it on that one at the back   well she did catch a piece of that stone at the back but  in the process removed it as well as the object stone  the shooter sits in the twelve  b c lies one  that's a great shot by jodi sutton   and a good call by julie sutton on that rock don because she has to hit it at the right angle to remove that one at the back which potentially could've been a danger to 'em them as the end progressed   kathy floyd with a nose hit who's been a rather prominent athlete in the province of new brunswick over the years  seven times she has represented the province in golf competition four times as a junior golfer three as an amateur  representative and three times on a national softball team  she's a great all-round athlete and it gives her a mental toughness from participating in so many sports   used to the pressure   colleen when you were playing new brunswick did you think they uh do you feel they favoured the in-turn  no they were fairly consistent with both turns  the reason i ask that is because they like to play the  with the outside-in in-turns all the time and b c are playing out-turns   well when it doesn't really matter which turn you take it just comes down to personal preference   or if you have a better release on the in-turn versus the out-turn   mental preparation mental toughness an important part of curling competition as well as the actual art of delivering a stone  well you can't get over-anxious  you have to be patient and like uh julie says you have to  calm yourself down   well kathy floyd may have laryngitis but heidi hanlon has no problems yelling   laugh yeah   she certainly lets you know whether you're to sweep or not  well she is just making up for kathy's zina uh laryngitis but that's the second hit she's had there that s  she's just gotten out   well julie put it right on the button in the fifth end and we'll see if she can uh put it on the tee-line here which is exactly the centre of the sheet  runs through the centre of the rings   well you get   a little bit shorter of that line tee-line   but good draw weight   well i think the sutton twins are somewhat relieved that  the worst that will happen on this end is that they will give up a single point  in the early stages of this end it looked as though new brunswick with last rock advantage might pick up two or even more   heidi hanlon not happy with that shot  she wanted to roll out   she picks up a single point with last rock on the sixth end  and so the score after six ends is new brunswick three british columbia two  you are watching the scott tournament of hearts live on sports weekend tv advertisements   neither side has been able to score more than a single point through six ends of play in this championship game at the scott tournament of hearts  new brunswick's heidi hanlon leading julie sutton of british columbia by a score of three two  in round robin play b c ten and one new brunswick eight and three  new brunswick with a victory nine seven on an extra end last night  over two-time canadian champion heather houston of thunder bay in the semi-final   well it's nice to have the bye straight into the final  most curlers would agree that it's uh great to play that semi-final if there's any way that you can be guaranteed to win because you're in a pressure-filled situation it's a game you've got to win  and you get a chance to play on this sheet of ice again   i think that applies in almost any sport colleen  if you were guaranteed success in a semi-final game rather than be inactive for a period of time leading up to a championship you would like to play  like to keep your competitive edges sharp  that's right  unfortunately there are no guarantees   melissa soligo will corner that yellow-handled new brunswick stone rolling it out  the shooter also rolls out of play   interesting end here uh for new brunswick don  there is a corner guard up belonging to british columbia and they may want to utilize it because they have last rock   heidi hanlon's saying to julie sutton okay julie i don't care about that corner guard  i'm going to put one up on the centre and you cannot ignore it  you have to hit it because if you don't i'm gonna  going to go around it and steal another point and i'm  gonna going to have real control of this game  so it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game going on here  and as the end progresses you know that may change a little bit but for now heidi hanlon's saying to julie sutton well i'm  gonna going to try and steal a point  i don't care about your corner guards   and julie sutton of course knows the danger of a centre guard and she's running it off  what she's trying to do now don is maybe hit and roll off to the corner a bit   you see that sherri stewart has out-performed as far as percentages go her b c counterpart melissa soligo 
Canada	 as you watch them brush those stones you see how they can really apply pressure  they get a lot of weight on that curved handle on that brush  and in such a position they can work a lot closer to the running surface of the rock  yes  you get a lot of pressure on it   now there's two corner guards up and heidi hanlon's asking kathy floyd once again to put a centre guard up   the danger here for kathy floyd is she not does not  want to come into the house don and put the rock on  high in the twelve-foot allowing b c to maybe hit and roll behind those corner guards   and they have not laid a brush to it   a lot of curlers might say well listen why doesn't she ignore the centre guard and go around the corner guard  which isn't a bad call but i think judy jul uh  julie just gonna going to play it very conservative here   run the centre one off  hope maybe that uh they come into the rings uh with a new brunswick draw and maybe hit and roll behind protection   it's around the seventh end for a curler that you start looking in a close game you start looking at  the the end you're in and you feel like you're running out of time sometimes to make your move   well to me the strategy has worked for heidi hanlon because now there is a centre guard and there's no question that she's   gonna going to go around it and  that's what she's waiting for  she sure will   heidi hanlon now going on the attack  jodi had to roll her shooter off that centre line and unfortunately she didn't  so now heidi hanlon's gonna going to  take advantage of it   heidi hanlon in her first appearance at the scott tournament of hearts in lethbridge in nineteen eighty-seven finished with a record of four and seven in nineteen eighty-nine in kelowna she finished at seven and four and in ottawa five and six during round robin play  you mean there's hope for me for next year  laugh you've only been there seven times colleen   your record is getting worse   you'd think i would learn  oh well thank you laugh   laugh   that's not quite a disaster for new brunswick  she still has her rocks out front  it poses a little bit of a problem for julie sutton  i think now uh   i really think julie's gotta got to go in  sh i i agree with you because she can't clear everything  no   even if she does clear it and make a great double peel and roll heidi's gonna going to go around one of those corners  i don't know whether she'd go around the corner but uh there may be one around that centre line that hang around after this  well i'm saying that she makes the double peel and roll and leaves nothing in the centre   she removed the yellow-handled stone but there is still  that centre rock to hide behind   you know it's your third's last rock you're one down  there's four guards up i think maybe you do a bit of a gamble and uh draw in around those as opposed to hitting them like julie sutton   at the risk of offending all the female curlers who are listening today are not men more inclined to gamble in these situations  i think maybe a little bit but uh you know all week here uh a lot of the women curlers did a lot of gambling   i mean you haven't you have not seen many strategic errors in this game   i mean they're almost flawless  the strategy has become so improved and it's thanks to television coverage with wireless mikes being able to listen to the skips saying what they are gonna going to be doing   there is the odd exception  some nova scotia teams really have trouble describing  thank you  thank you again you guys said very sarcastically   look at this   okay   that's the shot she wanted  this is the sh reason i think julie sutton should have gone in  it allowed the opportunity for heidi hanlon to put a perfect rock in there and that's exactly what she's done  it's in around the guard it's in front of the tee-line   you cannot have draw to it because it's in front of the tee-line you have to make contact with it   aren't there times when you're in those predicaments that you have to be the first one in  oh sure there is a time that you have to say well okay forget about defense let's go and get a little bit of offense into our game and get around the guards before the other team does   i mean heidi's called a near-perfect game so far   but julie sutton has a very good shot here  if she can make hit what she can see she may roll over to the left-hand side don around that corner guard   she has to save her shooter   oh boy   so now i think heidi hanlon will try and place a stone in exactly the same position   you know we heard uhm heidi during the fifth end break saying she thought she had a cutter and you've gotta got to  wonder if that yellow rock is cutting a lot harder than the  uh than the red  well she alluded to the fact that she thought heather houston had a problem with the yellow-handled stones last night   well for heidi hanlon she has an opportunity now to really put a lotta lot of pressure on julie sutton  she would like exactly the same rock maybe a foot deeper don to force british columbia julie sutton to make a very difficult draw with no backing   but i think she'd like to pull this in about another foot deeper into the four-foot but in front of the tee-line  not never ever behind it   you hear heidi yelling just for room lot  oh she's got a great-looking shot  aw this is just a beautiful-looking shot  now they're gonna going to take it into the four play  tight to the four play   look at that   ah if you picked it up put it in your pocket carried it all the way down the ice that would be the spot to put it   that's about as fine a draw as you'll see   now do you remember the fifth end when julie sutton played a draw against one and she put it right on the button   that's exactly what she's trying to duplicate   the only difference is that this time she has to be on the button laugh   the last time she could've afforded you know a  a little lighter   but she's remembering that draw same as before   and this is one where the sweepers play such an important role  oh  karri wilms and melissa soligo on that stone immediately  they con they control the rock   they're they're just keeping it clean  she has a ton of weight here   oh boy   there is nothing to rest against  she has to stop   aw she just slips to the back twelve-foot   and that enables new brunswick to steal two on the seventh end   so new brunswick has now taken control  new brunswick leads by a score of five two after seven ends  sports wrap-up show   it took seven ends before either side in this scott tournament of hearts was able to score more than a single point and it was a steal of two by heidi hanlon of new brunswick on the seventh end that has moved the new brunswick champions into a five two lead   and right now new brunswick is intent on really hitting everything in sight   and all the stones roll out of the rings   heidi hanlon was very busy on that rock  she was over to the side boards making sure the one touched then she uh had to go back and uh sweep her rock out of play   it's hanging on in the back but it's not in the house don and that rock could prove beneficial to b c as the end progresses but for now b c is gonna going to  try and throw up some uh put up some corner guards hoping of course that new brunswick either hits it on the nose or misses it completely  they have to get something started  they have to get a couple of rocks buried behind corner guards  and that's the way you score two points   the other way of course is of freezing the one that's not in the rings but just at the back of the house   and very quickly heidi hanlon moves out to ask for the removal of that b c stone from her second sherri stewart   a three   sherri stewart still curling at eighty-eight percent   laugh ah boy when you're hot you're hot   that stone rolled through and removed that rock that was hanging at the back out of play in behind the twelve-foot circle   don you know interesting enough out of the twelve skips  uh percentage-wise in the round robin uh playoff heidi hanlon was eighth  out of the twelve skips uh with uh sixty-two percent whereby julie sutton was number one with seventy-five percent yet their percentages are turned around here   heidi hanlon's curling eighty-four and julie sutton's only curling sixty-three  and i should also point out that we've been teasing colleen jones a lot this afternoon but she was a solid seventy-one percent  ah what's the old saying it's not my fault   laugh   laugh   laugh   colleen i thought you curled beautifully  now what do you two fashion connoisseurs think of the new look for the uh curlers   yes  being the fashion police that you are perhaps you've noticed that they aren't wearing bulky sweaters anymore and polyester pants  it's a very european look  well in the past at world championships we have seen the european rinks show up in this type of uniform uh a track suit type of uh uniform   i think most of the competitive curlers feel that they are very comfortable but there have been some curling associations that have complained about the provincial identification that one has associated in the past with the colour   as a competitor how did you feel about them  oh i liked them  i thought they were a new fresh look  they were comfortable to play in   british columbia here they can't get too discouraged about being down three because you know there's still lots of time  i just hearken back to my round robin game against heidi  we were down three playing the tenth end and scored three  wound up losing it in an extra end but uhm scoring three is not impossible   and that's the task now facing julie sutton   she trails by three with three ends remaining   the key for the skip for british columbia now is to remain focused and not to get discouraged which is a tough thing to do  well especially when you're down three points but you're right  she has to try and score two here  if she scores two she's right back in this game  this might be a break for her if it hangs in but it   a lot of rotation on that rock so it's gonna  going to spin right out of the rings  as you said earlier don when things are going well they  just seem to multiply and for heidi hanlon all three stones roll out of play  well that's right  if they hit that a little bit thinner that rock may have stayed in at the back and uh b c would be drawing for two but uh everything seems to be going new brunswick's way right at this st  point  you know new brunswick's heidi hanlon was telling me earlier in the week that they have felt like a team of destiny and that they feel that these things are almost as much fate as anything else   also helps if you have got four-foot draw weight laugh  yes that's true but i think uh i think  maybe if uh you reflect back on uhm this game and if new brunswick goes on to win this game i think julie sutton uh may think about that first draw of hers 
Canada	 as opposed to running off the guards maybe i think she should've gone in  i really do  on that seventh end with jodi sutton's final stone she should've asked her to draw in perhaps  on the seventh end   yes i really think  that's that was the shot  they couldn't get rid of all the guards and if they get it in first it puts a lot of pressure on new brunswick   that's the only stone in play and heidi hanlon will attempt to take it out of circulation   heidi's a real favourite among all the curlers  two years ago in kelowna she won the sportsmanship award  she's a wonderful person to play against  she just wants you to play your best and for  she wants to play her best  she got a nose hit on that b c stone   can julie sutton take advantage of that long guard   oh there's lots of room  it's just a question of where she's gonna going to  put the brush and how much she thinks it's gonna  going to curl in there   colleen remarked that this would not the rock  would not curl in this particular location but  but the hits have been moving so   so it'll have to break at the end for them to get by that guard and get it buried   and there's one thing about y playing the uh kind of straight turn  if you ever get it in around the guard it makes it very difficult for the opponent to take it out   they have to throw a little bit more weight   the key too is throwing it to your sweepers and make sure your sweepers are having control and being able to keep it all the way  if you throw it to the tee-line and don't allow your sweepers to  be sweeping it it doesn't move as well   as soon as she let it go julie sutton said tight   oh what a great shot  now if they can get it in   ah beautiful brushing by the front end of b c   see how close she was to the guard   the advantage of brushes in curling  going by guards and playing in the four-foot area   well swept by the front end   well the one thing about it for heidi hanlon if she can duplicate the same shot and maybe go not only go   by the corner guard don but the one that julie sutton just put there and get it in the eight-foot then it is really gonna  going to be difficult for julie sutton to get there   word   she has a lot of room  you'll see it's well still on the line  she she's got a very dead handle on this don  there's not much rotation to it so it should move pretty quick at the end   she puts it in the back of the eight to become shot   well julie sutton can get right back in the game if she can  come down that same path and push back that yellow-handled new brunswick stone   she will trail by just one   and she played the whole end to get a hit on the nose  heidi hanlon with her first one hit a corner guard on the nose  and now julie sutton's gotta got a great chance to get back in this game  she cannot afford to throw too much weight on this rock don   if she does it's gonna going to run very straight   she's well inside that line   oh she's got a great looking shot   oh a beautiful shot by julie sutton   so after giving up the steal of two on the seventh end julie sutton and her b c champions come right back on the eighth end  two excellent shots by julie sutton with her final stones to pick up a pair  she had to skin that guard with this rock and out-turn takeout  and she was on target  a nose hit on the shot stone to get her deuce   so after eight ends of play just one point separates new brunswick and british columbia and our live coverage will continue in a moment  tv advertisements   and we will be on hand next saturday and sunday at the copps coliseum in hamilton for the semi-final and the final of the labatt brier but right now we're watching the final two ends of the nineteen ninety-one scott tournament of hearts from saskatchewan place in saskatoon  five four new brunswick leads british columbia   two stones in play both to the left side of the centre line  which is really to the advantage of heidi hanlon of new brunswick don because she has last rock   and british columbia because the rock is fairly close to the centre are gonna going to try and go around it but unfortunately soligo just rubbed the guard  a little bit of a break by rolling into the rings but that changes the whole complexion of this end don because now if new brunswick hit and stays on this rock british columbia's gonna  going to have to play a takeout game where they are trying to steal a point to get back in the game  cannot afford heidi hanlon to have any rocks in the house   so by rubbing that guard has changed the whole complexion of this end   sheri stewart the new brunswick second is the leading percentage shooter   she's at eighty-nine percent   does she get a perfect score on that one  yes   the key for british columbia here now they have to make a play on this rock don  they'd lid like to get a little bit of movement on the shooter to the left maybe around those guards   there was a point a little earlier as you see the time clocks in the background where new brunswick had used up more time than british columbia   the situation is now reversed   the time won't be a factor  they both have twenty-four minutes left and that's plenty of time  i'm still waiting for the day and i hope it never happens that a  team runs out of time and then you forfeit the game   yes  what if the team is leading by about four at the  time laugh   exactly   more importantly what if they're playing the tenth end and the other team is up by nine  laugh   we may see the first contact curling   anyway by hitting and rolling out there it allows new brunswick now to utilize those corner guards don and hei   heidi hanlon's decided to go at  round the corner guard score two points and maintain that three point advantage that she had in the eighth end   two point advantage would certainly uh put heidi well in control and in the driver's seat  by the same token she doesn't want to get in the situation where she's forced to take one although being up two without isn't that bad a situation uhm   you'd rather have last draw at coming home or be three up   a little deeper than she wanted   exactly  that rock is behind the tee-line   it allows julie sutton to ask jodi to freeze to it   if it was in front of the tree tee-line  she couldn't do that   you know this b c team is a very physically active team   very disciplined   they participate in uh weight strength and endurance training during the course of the year   and i think from curling teams except maybe at the senior level we're seeing more and more of that   laugh   yes we certainly are  it's a long long week and you do have to be in fairly good shape in order to not get tired by the end of it   you do a lot of curling   jodi sutton has an excellent shot  aw what a gorgeous what a pretty curling shot that is   and that was the danger  the new brunswick rock settling behind the tee-line don  if it was in front of the tee-line british columbia couldn't have done that   you heard kathy floyd yelling way out there  and if she's got any kind of weight that rock will not move for her   look at it stay on that line   that's downtown  yes   as they say in curling she has definitely flashed it meaning missing altogether  during the course of the week colleen it seemed that when stones got on that centre line with draw attempts there was just no way of stopping them  that's right  it's got you gotta got to   wait for it to cross that centre line before you get the movement   well there's one thing about it  they're giving new brunswick lots of opportunities to get around the guards cos there's three of them out there   the danger here though is that rock is over a little bit more and they're having to take more ice to get around it don and that might be an area where it runs very very straight   and this ice is very sensitive   outside the centre line it's liable to run straight  if you're just a fraction heavy you hit the centre line and it's liable to curl   oh she looked like she threw that one pretty good   that's right  you mise might as well bring it back  the deeper you take it the more it'll bury   that's a pretty good curling shot   she went by the guard by maybe a good six eight inches don and the rock did its curling at the end and it's about uh half buried   you can see it there   just board weight   you do not want to overthrow this rock in this particular area  key shot here for the twenty-two year old sociology student at the university of victoria   boy she's close to that guard   no she rubbed it   so the end is now set up for new brunswick to get a pair and victory   now you play it to the open side   leave that rock on the four-foot and you pull it   play it away from those corner guards   this situation prompts a team meeting for new brunswick  okay   the decision has been made don and they're gonna  going to go in this area which i think is really dynamite   they should put the rock over in this area here and it has to be in the eight-foot because if they come if b c comes   down and hits and rolls over here they may not end up shot rock   i think this is a bit of a bad call  i really do   because if they put it in the top of the twelve-foot and b c hits and flops behind it then you've got major major problems  or if she puts it out a little bit and sets them up  for the double here  aw   you never draw to the open house or split the house when there's a whole bunch of guards on the right-hand side  no way   and it looks good for calgary to advance probably to the nationals once again  you know you know try to end their  o for seven streak in toronto   well they they lost both their final games against manitoba   ah that's true but i put my money on them word   that might upset a lot of guys   two seconds one second it's over   the calgary dinosaurs winners here tonight four one  and winners two nothing in the series so they advance and the bears'  season comes to an end after a thrilling three game playoff victory over lethbridge last week-end  they lost the lead in the third period last night here  steve and would never lead again  well   that's it  that was the killer  and uh losing paul strand for both games in this series uh  wasn't expected especially when he put on such a show last weekend and uh yesterday getting kicked out and today having to leave with uh what looks like serious hip or a charley horse injury  uh ah really tough for the bears but nothing to hang their heads about  they had a hell of a year   nobody expected them to come in the basically  in the top four and they're easily the second best team in  word or two canada west   four and one in the final and uh strand in a classy move by the alberta forward just standing down by the dinosaur bench to shake hands 
Canada	" darryn lawrence just walking by our broadcast facility  he was the referee in last night's game   draw will be to the stickhand side of colum cavilla   aaron zarowny will face-off against greg gatto   bears win the draw  christiansen a long shot  saved cavilla   he cleared the rebound himself  now a shot  and it's saved cavilla off aaron zarowny  centred out front by colin zarowny  and cavilla has had to come up with another stops on that exchange  another couple of saves on that exchange  uh lethbridge has the home team is the home team for tonight's game  they kinda kind of rotate it and uh   i'm not sure if the coaches and staff is tryna  trying to do line combinations against other lines but uh   tonight they got uh coach daum has had zarowny's line against  gatto's line and and disowic   and that was the lethbridge defense line last night so it's worked out good for the bears in that way  aaron zarowny will face-off against greg gatto once more  to the stickhand side of cavilla  bears tried for a late change but they couldn't get it in   they wanted to change up the defense   i think they wanted to have sherban and  and hjertaas against oh no sorry pullishy and goodkey against the unclear words line  oh you're lookin' looking at the bench aren'tcha aren't you to see who's next  out   right   who's up  who's up   bears have it off the draw  simpson shot  that's blocked  simpson gets another chance  rifles it wide of the net   cavilla pokes it off the backboards away from the cage  and there's disowic tryna trying to  clear   horns clear it  adair   now ahead to strand  he's hit hard  aaron and colin zarowny moving in  he rips a shot high and wide of the net   now hal christiansen takes a look  shoots it towards the net  a penalty coming up as greg gatto went down behind the play  and we'll see a pronghorn power play here   greg gatto's been in everybody's face tonight  he's a solid he's the captain of lethbridge  a solid player   and uh he's rocked a lot of guys tonight  kent simpson tried to give the defensemen a little bit of time there  it took him out of the play but it was a bit of interference and  i'm not sure if they call it tripping or hooking or interference but uh   tough call but the bears have ki looked so pretty good so far killin' killing   one of their best penalty killers in the box right now though   kent simpson heads off for the two-eleven mark   and so the pronghorns who are oh for two on the power play get their third chance here   frank esposito has a coupla couple of  goals  terry degner has the other as the bears lead it three nothing  i think it's tripping against simpson   here's harper from his own blue line as the pronghorns work on this power play   here they go  kelln for harper ahead on the left side to gatto  he's in across the line on the left wing  lets a shot go  nowhere near the net  bounces off the glass to the right point  kelln holds it in   goes in behind the goal  goodkey'll fish it out   goodkey steps out front of his own net   now he gets a chance to move it off the boards and down the ice   great play   great play by mark goodkey   kinda kind of  faked us out  i thought he was going right in front of the net but he pulled it back and made a nice stop   made a nice clearing play pardon me  jarret zukiwsky now with it   he's to the line and across  he can motor   spins it back to the point  nobody there though as the pronghorns have changed up their defense   one of them anyway   now here's gatto on the left wing in across the line  gatto driving  passing out front of the net  comes over to zukiwsky   zukiwsky back hand pass to gatto  to the right point to harper   back to gatto  lots of time  moves in from the circle  his shot is skipped wide of the net  comes off the boards   fired in around the boards by riehl  comes up the other side  gatto gets it back to the point to harper  one of the bears has lost his stick  here's a plus   saved masson   comes back to the point again   round behind the net  zukiwsky lays it there for o'rourke  has a man breaking his shot  went off his skate  bounces at the side of the net  and there's masson to jump on top of it   zarron doesn't say 'aaron' zarowny had lost his stick   and that put the bears effectively two men short   smart play though by aaron zarowny  for a while there th he didn't have a stick and uh  lethbridge a easy time up up top with the puck but uh he came out of his own zone when the pronghorns got the puck in their end to get a stick from the bench and why not cos you need a stick out there if you're gonna going to be uh  any deep to kill in the penalty  guba golden bears' mascot walking by our  gondola facility here   and offering his greetings for the evening   great with the kids isn't he  tony hackett   chuckle   face-off stick-hand side of masson   horns have it off the draw  gatto to the point for riehl  back to gatto  back to riehl  lets the shot go  it's blocked   and a great play by esposito  he blocked it and then swept it down the ice himself  great play by esposito  everybody on the bears i everybody's into this game tonight  here's wobick with it ahead to riehl on the left side  he fires it in across the bear line  masson knocks it down behind the net  trevor sherban'll play it off the boards to the line and out  riehl sends it back in  that'll allow the bears another chance  there's one second  that's it  simpson's out of the penalty box   the bears killed off  here's simpson with the puck at centre ice steps in on the wing  fires it toward the net  cavilla stops it  back to play it is wobick  plays it up the wall   carpenter's hit but he got it ahead to gatto  however trevor sherban sends it right back in   it's a late offside against the bears   as i thought they tagged up but the linesmen disagreed  and we get a break  fifteen twenty-seven to go in the second   three nothing   university of alberta golden bears lead the university of lethbridge pronghorns in canada west university playoff hockey action  game two of this best of three here at the clare drake arena  and a little frustration starting to show on the pronghorns' bench uh   a power play  couple a of the big boys  zukiwsky and gatto weren't happy with some of the work by uh uh jeremy zeihl speaker error: should be "" riehl""   made a couple very uh ill-timed passes and uh   and a little bit a of chirpin'  chirping going on on the bench   horns hammered it into the bears' zone  back to play it is thompson  thompson a chance to clear  he flips it into the near the bench  of the bears  comes off the glass  here's tiltgen driving towards the net  he's tied up   the puck got away from him and disowic has it at centre   plays it over the right side for carpenter  he sends it in across the line   masson knocks it down  comes over to  here's a shot  dave masson has disowic turned  he got a loose puck and ripped it from a sharp angle   as i think that was uh an attempt by degner from the corner to corral that puck but it took a crazy hop off his stick  right into the lane for disowic and his shot was stopped by masson  you don't wanna want to give lethbridge an easy goal   and you don't i suppose wanna want to  give 'em them a power play goal either and get their power play runnin' running   i think uh i'm with you kevin i think   one of the main focus for the bears is th  is not to take penalties  lethbridge they don't really look tired   uh the power play in my opinion is the only thing that's  gonna going to get 'em them  back in this hockey game  three nothing alberta in front of lethbridge   esposito will face-off against graham outside the bear line   comes over on the left side  leroux sends it in across the line  behind the net  masson leaves it for pullishy  gets it ahead to strand and he'll bounce it off the boards  can he get it out  yes he does  esposito has it  now ahead to haney   he's in across the line  haney with a wrist shot  he ripped one high over top of the net  back to the right point simpson   he'll wind up  lets a blast go  blocker save by cavilla   and it ends up in the crowd   good shot there  first haney went a high and hard with a wrist shot and then simpson the same spot with a a a good slapper and uh  uh keep throwin' throwing a puck at cavilla  he's played pretty well  both nights uh no soft goals  all the goals have been pretty good for the bears so far  haney shoots left  came down on the left wing and ripped  he really leaned into it and sizzled one past cavilla but it was just a little high and over top of the net   dean tiltgen will face-off now for the bears against tyler graham   draw will be to the glove-hand side of cavilla   tiltgen's waved outta out of there so in comes degner  degner has the golden bears' third goal here tonight   bears fight for control   degner has it in the right corner  degner centres out front  here's a shot   and a stop by cavilla off of thompson   puck deep in the lethbridge zone   deep in the corner   simpson skates  there's degner  tripped up on the play  got it over to thompson  thompson walks in  thompson can't get free  left point  held in by pullishy   there's tiltgen turning in the left corner now  tiltgen  cycles it down low but kelln intercepts   and the pronghorns will clear  comes in on goal   masson knocks it down for goodkey  plays it up the boards for degner  he lost it   horns with a chance   they pick it up on the turnover   now tiltgen able to clear it out to centre  scary play there for a moment but the bears were able to cover up   goodkey from behind his own net   gets it ahead on the wing  degner out to centre ice for aaron zarowny  that's broken up   goodkey from his own end   zukiwsky now   he lost it  here comes aaron zarowny  he's hammered on a play by regan harper   this might go as interference although the pass was coming over there  it was blocked but the pass was on its way and harper stepped into aaron zarowny before the puck got there and we're gonna  going to see a bear power play   and i think evan it was a bit of a uh make-up call cos thirty seconds before that i didn't see the entire play and i'm not sure if uh uh referee mccory saw it either but mike thompson just got whacked   and he's a tough guy and he was rollin' rolling  all over the ice and you don't see that much and uh   i'm not sure i i it looked like the end of a slash maybe but uh he got whacked hard and maybe george mccory saw part of that and then decided to even it up cos uh  unclear word the pass was coming to zarowny and it was a good play by harper actually  bears are in front three nothing jake but they've only had one power play  this'll be their second   and we see darryn krywko and uh mike jickling swap  once again on uh left point   harper for interference at six thirty-three and the bears go to work on the power play  as trevor d sherban starts up from centre "
Canada	 introduction of speaker   that's right that's the uh the interesting thing about uh what we're we're   talking about today  it's so far we have many titles to choose from  i uh i gave them the  the title uh nobody said it was going to be easy   and uh kimberly was much more optimistic  she had how to succeed your first year  and uh maybe i dunno don't know i'm uh   if o if i could do it over again and laugh in reflection on on the first year of teaching so ah  i think what it w what it comes down to is is uh is a sharing uh idea of uh what is a first year of teaching and uh what it represents the stress it represents and uh a lot of the uh the  workload that it represents  and uh my experience through it and how i went through it  and   there'll probably be things which will be similar for you but it'll be you know probably different as well depending on what your situation's  gonna going to be compared to mine  and the way i word this is a very loose kind of outline okay and uh if there's anything that you would like to talk about too you know if you can a you can ask at any time if you want because i like to see this as more of a discussion than you know a lecture   ah   so we're gonna going to start with after the job interview which is uh the situation is  you now have your job okay  we're not worried about uh you know how you get a job and your job situation  what i'm talking about is you have a job okay  you went to your job interview er it went well and now they say okay now we're gonna going to give you the method   here's your classroom  you are a teacher okay  and uh the way i felt about after i had the job interview  and and i i  walked out  at first you feel very you know you're very happy that you  have it but at the other side you feel like uhm kind of like an imposter   because you don't you had the job interview and you talked about you know whatcha what you're gonna going to do if there's a discipline situation  you talked about whatcha what you're   gonna going to do if with   the programming  you talked about how you're gonna going to   teach english and everything but you didn't act   you haven't actually done it yet   you know what i mean  so now you're actually gonna going to  have to do it so laugh   you come to the now you you there's a   kind of a week period in which you start in school before you actually get into class into classes in which you have you know ped pedagogical days  teacher-only days right you have like about a week of ped  pedagogical days in which you you're   you're thinking about this over and over again what are you going to do and how are you going to deal with it   and what i want to tell you is that you better know  ah laugh you better know what you're going to do uh before you you step into the class and don't count on these ped pedagogical days  okay don't count don't think that they're gonna going to give you time okay after your job interview  don't think they're going to take care of you in a very big way  okay  you're on your own in that sense okay  and the thing that i i found very very difficult when i started teaching was the amount of meetings was the amount of meetings that we had okay  you had five days and they basically had five days of meetings  okay  they had no time to actually prepare   because you're walking into a situation in which most teachers  especially today in the situation in quebec most teachers have like at least fifteen years of experience up till twenty years  they don't need a week to prepare their first day of school  you know they know what they're going to do  so for them it's sort of well what are we going to do with this time so quite often they have meetings and and  they discuss how they're going to prepare uh the schedule for example or they might talk about rules in class and word rules in the school  uh they might talk about presence how we're going to deal with uh the papers  or what are we gonna going to do about uhm recycling and  things that for you have no you know what are you going to do  on your first day  the most important meeting which is the meeting in which you're gonna going to meet the students  how are you going to to meet the students  what are you going to say to the students   you have to think about that  that is your priority  and what happens is that when you're going to come in for after the job interview and it's your first few days the first thing you're gonna going to realize is that  every school no matter which school you go to every school has its way of  being has its political structure  you have your unions  you have your different   if you go to a big school you'll have different departments  okay  if you go into a village you'll have families  you know like there's the the tremblays  and the and you know they have all the  d&eacute;panneurs quebec word for corner store and  the the you know the the the the gaud  the the gaudreaux have the have the gas station and they hate the tremblays and  you know there's there's a whole bunch of things that you don't even know when you walk into a situation  and if you go into a big city like montreal there's probably political situations which you don't know about which   you you just don't know about   and you're kind of like a laugh i  kinda kind of see it as as   you're you're very vulnerable  laugh starts   let's put it that way okay  you're vulnerable laugh ends   and when you go in uh there'll be different people who  wanna want to bring you onto their side  okay there's somebody let's bring him onto my side  let's bring him onto my side  the principal hey buddy you know   you're a good guy  be on my side   and then you're gonna going to walk into to teachers' office and oh that guy is such a jerk you know  you don't wanna want to have anything to do with him you know  you know we all hate him and you know what he did and  and s so you're very torn between this  and then you have the union who come in and go you know you're a member of the union now and and things you have to deal with  you have to deal with the union  so you have many many uh pressures that you don't even  know how to deal with at first  and in i believe you don't really you should not deal with that right away   y'know you know if i if i had something if i could do it over again going into my first day of teaching going into a new school i would i wouldn't  i wouldn't say very much you know  i would have my thing   if if you have all these meetings well  you're gonna going to have to prepare your  first meeting with your students  how are you gonna going to deal with those students  and that's that's the most important thing   okay what are you going to say to the students when you first meet them  because half of your year okay at least is  dictated by the first five minutes that you meet the students  it sounds uh exaggerated but it's not okay  the impression that you give to your students on the first day of classes is extremely important okay  and what happens is that we get a lot of kind of   we get a lot of advice okay you won't be missing any advice   except you get kinda kind of strange advice so getting advice like don't smile   okay when you meet the students don't smile  be very strict when you meet the students okay uh  don't talk to them about your life  don't  you know you get all these kind of things that you shouldn't do   but you don't get very much of what you should do okay and how  you should meet the students  and the thing is is that when you meet the students for the first time uhm they don't know who you are okay and they don't know that you don't you know that you have  no experience as a teacher okay  laugh starts they don't know that yet laugh ends   okay  that's a gr that's a they'll find out  audience giggling throughout this   that they'll find out soon enough  but they don't know that yet okay and so  and if they do know that you're a new teacher they do know that you're a brand new teacher they don't know if you're a good teacher or a bad teacher okay  they'll pick these things up   they pick these things up very quickly okay so   but they will know who you are okay  students will pick up who you are in a very real sense of the meaning okay  as a university student we're very polite  we have a we believe in distance and uh we believe in respecting other people  unive uh students primary  secondary students they're going to know who you are as a person  and they analyze everything  they look at you and they pick up everything   and things that you never thought about like that you forgot about for years as a university student or you know they snapping fingers starts pick it up like that within a second snapping fingers ends   you know things that maybe you hestitate when you speak  maybe you wear glasses  maybe you know th   things you never really thought about all of a sudden ah ha you wear glasses  you know yeah okay well  it's very yeah it's   and it it but it builds onto that  you know   so when you meet them for the first time you have to make them realize that you are a teacher  that's who you are  and they are students   okay you are not uh their buddy   you're not their friend   you're not their parents you're not their mom or their dad  that you're not their uh scapegoat  they don't get to push you around  you're their teacher  okay so that's what you have to show  but at the same time you have to know what is a teacher  what is your definition of a teacher   because they're saying to you after your job interview you are a teacher   but are you a teacher  do you believe that you're a teacher after your job interview   loud banging noise followed by audience nervous laughter   do you believe that  do you believe loud banging again that you're a teacher after your job interview  audience member responds   how long do you think it takes to be a teacher  if i was to say the number of word well  from from whatever  if i say a time how much time do you think before you can say i'm a teacher   audience member responds   a lifetime some audience laugh   do you believe it's a lifetime  different audience member responds   after two years   different audience member responds   okay   same audience member responds   so do you believe in a sense that when  after your job interview you are a teacher  in that sense  same audience member responds   even before  same audience member responds   that's interesting   same audience member responds   no  same audience member responds   that's right  that's that instinct 's good  it's sort of a i i   and that   it's true our i you know you're sort of naturally a natural born teacher you know  three or four words natural born killer  audience laughs   a natural born teacher  and uh and a lifeline a lifelong   experience  and we have a about after two years  uhm  i asked that to uh when i started teaching  uh another teacher friend of mine said when i   when i started teaching he said you know the first   first couple of weeks is gonna going to  be tough  you know the the kids are  gonna going to test you  you know   and then i went to see my conseiller p&eacute;dagogique  you know the c p con uh the pedagogical advisor  and he said uh the first couple of months you know   that 's pretty tough you know  you know that's a tough couple of months  and then i and then i saw uh i met  another teacher  other word i think he was actually two or three words audience laughs   i'm not somebody said i'm not i don't remember and they said the first year is very very tough  the first year you know  well then i started losing more and more you know  and then i went to a speed confere how   i went to co-operative learning and uh met a teacher there and he said ten years  two or three words ten years before you can say that i'm a teacher i know what i'm doing  you migh you have experience you know what it is  and the more i think about it the more i i  would agree with with him in the sense of it takes it takes a while 
Canada	 laugh thank you very much carly   uhm i could probably talk to you for two hours without stopping about what's going on at the cegep collège d'enseignement général et professionel   uh what i would like to do is give you some general information  and please jump if you have any questions i think the simplest thing is just jump in if you have a question something's not clear what are you talking about or someone told me that is that really true  uhh please the information in here is for you so uh uh  word what you want to know about  maybe just very quickly to to step back before august of this uh present school year to what the cegep was before the reform hit and certainly knocked e s l english as a second language  requirements out of all recognition  uhm roughly before that we probably had about ten percent of the student population taking english courses   more in montreal uhh less in the uh outlying regions  that was roughly the clientele  some programs had english as uh a compulsory course  uh for example language programs  computer science had ahh an english that was compulsory   uhm office management technology had several english courses uh business english courses compulsory  uh and a certain amount of that some of it depended on  provincial coordination programs  others local cegeps could decide okay we're going to put english into this program  uhm aside from that i think maybe seventy-five percent of the students took english as an elective  so they were there because they'd they'd  chosen they wanted to be  uh with the reform we now have a hundred percent of the student body in english courses  uh whether they like it or not they're there and they have to pass two courses before they get their their  diploma   some teachers felt that uh this would create a a what division excitement whatever in the classroom uhh but from what i've heard i haven't heard very many if any negative comments that these students don't want to take english courses  uh they may have trouble with the w  what's expected of them but there's certainly no big beef that gee we don't think we should have to learn english  so that that's one view that has not in fact materialized   another bit of background is what the course  courses were before  there was a description about ten lines long uh half a page wide that described what the course was  uh in addition in what was called the cahier de  word mots g&eacute;n&eacute;ral uhh  there was sort of a profile of the student at the end of these two courses will be able to blah blah blah and the rest  some teachers were aware of what was in it  other teachers weren't  uh it was a fairly wide open field  not to say that the job wasn't well done but it was shall we say open to interpretation   with the reform there are more definite standards  uhm how well they're adhered to we'll find out in a couple of years once the proverbial dust settles  uh and to give you an idea of what student now do uh students in their compulsory courses have what are called sound of chalk on a blackboard uh cours de formation  g&eacute;n&eacute;rale   which means in other words you have to do it commune  uhh  hang on i'll go back here  propre and compl&eacute;mentaire  sound of chalk on a blackboard ends   so it's in this block where students have to do a certain number of courses  in the the  compl&eacute;mentaire there are uh three french courses there are at the moment two philosophy courses two phys ed courses and one english course that all students take and they're mixed up  and no matter what program they're in they end up in one of these courses  okay   ah one new thing with the reform the first two french courses are four hours instead of three hours  so some hours were added to french although it remained  at at at four courses  uh philosophy lost a course  at the moment the minister is looking into putting an hour into the first course   uh and at the moment phys ed is at two courses although there is a  possibility it may go back up to three  an there's one english course   then the ministry created what's called cours propre    uhh try to find the definition   uhh sorry there ain't one  uhm the ministry doesn't really  well the ministry sort of has one  uhm i what i have dubbed them   chalk sound begins and ends   i've been have fun with making up acronyms of things  i've called they're not e s p they're e s s p english for sort of a specific purpose uh because  they don't they're not addressed to a program  laugh group response   it's not english for computer science english for nursing english for business administration  it's english for a group of families that the cegep has put together   okay  uh so that's this  in english it's it makes it makes   certainly more sense or it's more obvious than in other courses  so if they had an chalk sound starts english french  and philosophy chalk sound stops course called une cours propre   okay  the other terminology that you may hear also referred to is   chalk sound starts block a block b chalk sound stops  uh a lot of different terms were were   bandied about at the beginning and some of them have stayed even though there is an official term   kay okay   so no matter what program they're in they're all mixed up  it sort of depends on timetables  they take a course in english in the block a the  formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale commune and then they have a  une cours prop uh and each cegep decides how the families will be put together   okay  and the other element of the formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale is cours compl&eacute;mentaire  and those are the electives  and with the reform since english has now moved into the  compulsory courses students cannot take english as an elective   okay  so students must take two english courses in their regular program but they it's not an optional course anymore  the the electives are divided into five or six families uhm which i don't remember uh but there are things like uh technology and science uhh human science uhh art that sort of thing uhh and modern languages  but with the reform the distinction made is that english is  la langue seconde in francophone cegeps and french and anglophone cegeps and langues modernes is anything excepting english and french   okay  and langues modernes fall under the electives  so if it's spanish or german or italian or hebrew or whatever else it happens to be russian or yiddish those are electives and those  are there but english cannot be chosen as an elective by the student since they automatically have two courses to pass   am i going too fast or if it's not clear give me a holler  question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   for example in uhh there's a new program coming in uh our cegep uh hotel management technology   for example they have two courses in their in this  block formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale commune et propre  plus the the other element is   chalk starts what's called formation sp&eacute;cifique and that's all their core programs  chalk stops   whispered response   so for the hotel people it's uhh uhm i don't know what their courses are uh but in the in the computer science program for example they have programming this programming that and all the rest of it and if there's an english course in there then it  it's obligatory it's not by choice   okay  and in the hotel management in addition to their two courses they have three other english courses that are under cours sp&eacute;cifique question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   i don't know if they're going to change the word cegep to   i don't know cepet or something   laugh   but it's now uh what we call pre-universit&eacute; et technique instead of g&eacute;n&eacute;ral et professionel   response   that's another bit of technol of terminology   terminology has changed  so what was called professionel which in english translates vocational and not professional in fact uh is now become technical and what was general is now pre-university  pre-universit&eacute;   so those are the two  so whether whatever program they're in they have to do this and this   response   and in the cours compl&eacute;mentaire at the moment it's three courses but if philosophy gains an hour if phys ed gains another course the comp the electives go from three down to two question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker  uhm i'll give you the codes for the levels  uhh the new course levels uhm are this chalk starts and stops   there are in fact five levels  uh unfortunately with the reform codes they've decided codes don't mean anything and don't have to mean anything and they don't mean anything   uhh for example one oh four happens to be lower than one oh one  okay   uh so there are five levels   there there's a reason for it although it's not that logical and it may it may change  uh the ministry first gave a mandate to the writing committee saying okay we would like two english courses one for sort of the  sort of the hoi polloi that have sort of done something and that's that and ones who are really advanced and we said that really won't work because there's a big gap in the middle and there's maybe something underneath that too  uhh so they said well just make us two courses and we'll see  so we we wrote out two courses keeping a bunch of things in the back of our mind noting there was a hole in the middle and we kept those things to fill in the hole  so the ministry then says oh my goodness yes you're right we need three courses  so we came up so they came up with  uh the request for three courses  three courses were created one oh one one oh two one oh three  uh and then below this level we said there are a lot of students that aren't up to the level of one oh one we need another course or we're going to have fifty percent of the students doing make-up courses that won't count for their for their diploma  uh and they said oh my goodness i guess you're right again so we'll create another course and we have to call it something so the next number is one oh four and in fact it's lower than one oh one   okay  so the jargon is this is ensemble un ensemble deux ensemble trois for the moment this is called ensemble transitoire   it may not be as transitoire as they thought  and this is called word &agrave;  word chalk starts and stops   okay   uh and as you mentioned johnny when the students arrive at the cegep uh they are tested by whatever tools people are using  the perfect or imperfect as they are they are in fact tested  and then students are streamed into one of these four levels or if they're very weak uh will be s put into a word  &agrave; word for which they  there's a very fine distinction in french uh le cours accr&eacute;diter n'est pas comptabiliser   so they get a credit for it but it doesn't count   okay  the reason they get a credit for it is so that the cegep has the money to pay the teachers who teach it uh but they can't count it for  their their dip their cegep diploma   question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   some cegeps take the placement test and say okay you're below this level you do the word &agrave;  word other cegeps give them a choice hey you think you can handle the one oh four try it if you fail well take it again   uhh some of the cegeps said oh we don't have time to do this we'll just put them all there sink or swim  what's the difference whether they if they   do this and this or this twice  uh and they're one of the effects  of the reform is that the local cegeps have more autonomy than they've had in the past and there're a lot of decisions that local cegeps can make  and if you talk to your friends and you get sorta  sort of five different answers that's quite possible if they're from five different cegeps  each administration does have a certain amount of latitude  question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   uh our policy is that the s the teachers have three weeks to do something  either the student comes and says uh it's too easy it's too hard or the teacher realizes uh that there's a student here and that they understand everything and all the jokes so uh they don't really belong here because those students shouldn't understand a lot 
Canada	 uh so teachers at our high s  school teachers have three weeks   to to move the students around  uh what we decided this year was to take a writing sample and if students said uhh this course is too hard for me to look at the writing sample and say oh yes you're right or oh no sorry you're just trying to get an easy credit so you're going to stay where you are  so so there we  can move them around  and the ministry has put out a i guess a  call for tenders uhh through a program called word  uh which is for research uhh and they have called for tenders to create a new placement tool uhh that will reflect the new programs  uhh to test this use in maybe half of the new cegeps at the moment called tecas teste three words seconde  uhh was put together in nineteen seventy-four with the understanding that the ministry would give us money and we would revamp it and continue it and follow it up and make changes  however uh there has never been any more money and it's in the state it was in nineteen seventy- six i guess  word around there  so it's being used  uhh it's not the best tool  it does uhh discriminate reasonably well  some cegeps have added added bits and pieces to try and make it a little more uhh what precise i guess  we're looking at adding some sort of cloze test and then taking the borderline students say we cut from one level ah at fifty-nine well if they got fifty-five to sixty-five let's look at their cloze test and see  if if in fact they should be on which side of the line they should fall   but again there is no provincial standard  uh evaluation belongs to the each  individual cegep  so the ministry cannot in a sense impose a provincial placement test unless the f&eacute;d&eacute;ration des cegeps  which is made up of all the directeurs directeuses des &eacute;tudes says to the ministry would you please make us a provincial test  no cegep has to use what exists  they can decide we have our own way and this is the right way and  that's what we're gonna going to do  so so they are stream  streamlining those ya and there's a certain amount of   of freedom moving them around  uh for example if students test at this level and they go off somewhere for six weeks and th or they  take a job in toronto for the summer uhh they can come back and redo the test or say to the teacher hey i'm i'm better than i used to be or was tested   okay   uh what's unfortunately confusing also is that uh so this is the highest level uhh students do literature  uh they have to read three literary genres  uhh novels the other ahh a novel a play a short story   there is a fourth one clarification by audience   uhh they had to do do some of those  so it's quite advanced  the problem is that the old numbering system also had a one oh three and it was always the lowest level  so uh if you're the transition  has not been that easy  okay  uh another i think that happens with the new courses is the old courses were built on a vertical scale so that way at the bottom there actually was a one oh one one oh two but it was sorta sort of for people that almost didn't know the alphabet uhh and  certainly door squeaks in certain cases  in montreal they didn't give it for for immigrant classes who use a different alphabet  and that was  that's fine door squeaks   uh otherwise most cegeps start out at the very lowest thing with  sorta sort of like you know what's your name   tuesday  uh no sorry it's not tuesday today  what's your name   that was the one oh three and then it went up one oh four three oh one three oh two  there were some odd courses in here  and then nine oh one  and students would progress up the scale from one course to another course  if they had three courses to do or if they chose two or three if they passed this they did the next one if they passed this they did the next one that sort of thing okay with one oh three being the lowest level  what's what has happened with the reform is that students no longer uh it's not a vertical move the way it used to be   uh students are come in at a level and they progress and move across to this cours propre   so if they come in at one oh four they do that course and then they move on to a course that is in some way adapted to a group of programs  okay  it's not that they do this course and then this course and then this course   okay  so if they do a course in this block a the cours de formation commune then they move across  and i can't even give you a code over here  uh why don't we just call it block b and call it b zero  which is a bit insulting but you know  i'm sorry you're a zero  uh the reason it happened is cos once the b one two and three levels were established and you create something below it well what else can you call it except zero  these poor people got dubbed minus zero at one point  but  laugh   anyhow so the students move from here to there  only in exceptional cases and programs where they have several courses will they actually perhaps go from here to here and then across   most of the students do cours word   across cours propre   okay question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   uh the ministry realized that they have spent a lot of money on a few of these copies and got criticized so then they started photocopying  uhm what was done for the first the block a courses uhh the courses were the ministry wanted courses developed uhh along the lines of competency-based education uhh where you decide okay the students are to reach this competency  these are the various parts of it  this is how we will judge whether they have reached that competency and this is what they will do to get there  okay   uhh i see a couple nodding  that's nice because not everybody thinks it's so nice and nods   uh so the ministry came up with what's called uh  une word de la comp&eacute;tence   okay so for example uh i'm looking at the ensemble un  the one oh one level here and it says communiquer en anglais avec des certains exemples   so what does that mean  right  so then it's broken down into four elements uh of the competency and it goes essentially through the four skills  and it's one is  d&eacute;gag&eacute; l'essence du message oral a few words  deux minutes   uh two is d&eacute;gag&eacute; l'essence d'une texte  word g&eacute;n&eacute;rale a few words  cent sept cinq sept cent cinquante mots    three is s'exprimer oralement   and four is r&eacute;diger une texte   again reasonably vague but those are the different parts of the competency that will be able to tell us what can this student do with a certain amount of ease  then there was standards that are set and under the standards they're called word la performance   okay  so comp&eacute;tence broken down into  id&eacute;alement de la comp&eacute;tence and then to decide whether they've been reached or not they're word  du performance   and under that there are certain standards being able to recognize this being able to write a certain length uh with a certain amount of precision as to grammar structure verb forms et cetera uh being able to speak on a certain type of topic for a length of time that sort of thing  uh and the what unfortunately   cau caused created  a lot of problems the last column here is called activit&eacute; d'apprentissage and it became a catch-all  what didn't fit into objectives or standards it was sort of oh we'll stick it in the last column and so the column got stuck with a lot of very strange things that that have frustrated people a lot uh in the classroom  it's sort of well what wha how  come you've got four verb tenses mentioned  what's how is that an   ac activity a learning activity   well it's not a learning activity but it had to go in the third column  sorry  uhm so anyhow that's that's that's   what we have  so in this in the  activit&eacute;s d'apprentissage there are in fact indications as to for this level what would be appropriate uhh for form focus or structure or grammar or call it what you will that would be appropriate to  quote unquote master be able to use at that level  okay  it has sent some people at the secondary level into uhm  major curtain-climbing activities uhm because it's sort of a lot a lot you're teaching grammar and that's all  uh which is not really the case but anyhow we'll work at it  uh so the ministry has come up with that  what how you decide to  for example it says role-play  the whatever roles you decide you want to have the students do and all the rest of it is up to the teacher to decide  if you decide uh at a at advanced  level gee there's a really good role play would be to have uhh the guys buy playboy and the girls buy playgirl and look through it and have a discussion on you know what the media does with peoples' bodies  uh that would work  uh you cou could   at the cegep level there the ministry does not dictate these books are acceptable these are not acceptable as they do at the secondary and primary level  so it's really essentially wide open  you whatever books videos  whatever you can get your hands on whatever you create yourself if that's how you feel you can move your students to what they're supposed to do then uhh that's that's fine question/answer exchange between a and extra-corpus speaker   the teacher has the freedom to choose the textbook he or she wants to work with and cegeps  again it depends from cegep to cegep   cegeps have a certain amount of a budget to to  buy teaching resources  okay  uhh flash cards or i videos or textbooks or uh cassettes whatever  uh i'm not sure how many volumes we have but we have a couple of hundred volumes in our department that teachers can use for additional activities  okay  so you can choose the textbook you want or a group of teachers doing a course says get together and teachers decide  of these five books uh this new book that came out by so and so is a really great book and so we're going to use it  uhh and that's the book they use and then supplement with whatever you want question/answer exchange between a and extra-corpus speaker   students have to buy their students are supposed to buy the books at the co-op   at the every cegep has a student co-op  and so in june our teachers phone the co-op and say okay we want seven hundred copies of this and three hundred of that and it's there and students buy them   you could always have them buy stuff off- campus  in in montreal it will probably work reasonably well  in quebec city it doesn't too well  but you can't one thing is you can't  sell books to your students  that's that's actually against the law in cegeps  uhm so so there's that  that opening is there  or if you've decided there are no books that are half as good as what i could do and you want to do your own materials through the whole semester that's uh that's a word  too  okay   maybe i'm worried about the block b  i've talked about each cegep can make up their own families  uhh it's it has also been a  so a a problem uh because there's supposed to be some sort of standardization with the new courses uhh but the ministry has has left  several doors open and that's one of them  for the block b there are two things  a the learning activities column is blank  okay  each cegep uh can write out its own learning activities for the block b courses the cours propre the sort of specific purpose ones  uhm so what most cegeps are doing is the administration is saying okay english department or language department come up with some learning activities  and they get presented and explained and then uhh they're accepted 
Canada	 so that that could vary from cegep to cegep the learning activities for the cours propre the block b  then each cegep can decide how far it's going to apply what is  said in here as chalk sound starts and stops   word uhh un programme ou un groupe de programme   theoretically a cegep could say we're putting all the programs in one family  that's the way we deal with it   okay   uh i've heard of one cegep i think is doing that a small cegep  theoretically a cegep could say we have twenty families we are going to have twenty s block b courses and get this at four different levels a course   theoretically it could be that  obviously you would need a cegep of something like probably fifty thousand students to make it really work out  uhh so the c cegep   every cegep is stuck with the problem of okay how do we make it word   a it has to be manageable  you can't end up with having six and seven students in various groups  uh it will depend on the different programs in in  cegeps  some cegeps may have six programs  other cegeps   we have somewhere around twenty  uhh our problem is double because we have two campuses and the same programs are not on the same campuses always  uhm plus you have programs that have heard hey gee we're going to get an english course just for us  and then you have to say well i'm sorry there's not a program just for you  we're going to put you with somebody else  then you have to decide who goes with whom  uh not an easy task  uhm some cegeps uh one cegep for example has gone the route of we will make two families one family is pre-university one family is technical  that's it   okay  it can be as limited as that or as limited as  as nothing i suppose  and they said okay we have enough students we can make two families in each of the levels  so they have eight different courses   a problem is when you talk to your colleagues uh every cegep has a different code for that course  the only possible way of talking about something in common is what we do is refer to as b zero b one b two b three  and if i say b cordia b two level  to a colleague they know exactly what i'm talking about  but if i said oh it's the uhh we have   three courses we've got a d w c and d x e and a d x d all at that level  it would mean nothing  cos the first two letters identify the cegep   so i don't know what the codes are in montreal but ours is d x and d w  other cegeps could be t r and t s and b d and b f and who knows what  so if if you want to compare apples and apples the only way is really to talk about b zero one two three  lengthy question/answer exchange with multiple extra-corpus speakers   another example is office management technology  at our place they used to do three courses uhh one of them   being was called three oh eight a business english course  uhh the when we first started talking they decided okay we'll we've got these two courses and we'll keep the other three that'll make five  they need lots of english   uh then i suggested well why don't we give them a whole semester in english  that would really help them although that's not manageable  uh and then because office management technology programs in cegeps are shrinking because it might end up back at secondary uhh  they decided that one of the reasons possibly is that they decided to move some of the english courses out so they could put more office management technology courses in which in a way makes makes sense uh made sense   so the r end result was there used to be three courses there are still three courses they're just a little different  so the students in office management technology at our place now do  this this plus the three oh eight  so it boils down to the same thing  but they could have decided to keep the other three and add the two  new courses  but again it's a local decision  it's up to the department involved to uh to  make a proposal and then the cegep to decide  and each department understandably is sort of jealous of what's happening because if they  for example in computer science if they keep the three seventeen that means there's a computer science course they can give whereas if they sort of oust the three seventeen then they can put in another computer science course  so it's ah a bit of politicking in some cases question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   i've heard of one cegep where they're looking at five different families  i'm not sure they're going to manage it  uhm anyhow  what's happened what we've suggested at our cegep is that at this level since it's so basic it really doesn't make a lot of sense to go into anything very specific and we would simply keep one family here  and because of the clientele of of not a great deal of students are at this level we are keeping one family here but certain of the assignments that the students will be given they will do based on the program they are in  if one of the themes is the environment well then they will deal with the environment based on if they're in mechanical engineering or  nursing or whatever they're in  uh there's also an element in this b three course uh where  the families is uh the families are sorry uhh where they have  to translate  so the text it may it may   turn out that the text they end up translating from  english to french or french to english whichever way they're going   would be texts that they take on their own text books  or something like that  so we feel that at this level without making separate families because we don't have enough students we could still adapt it through what they're doing in course  this level we felt uh was too weak  and we suggested two families at this level to start with simply pre-university and technical  uh we did a survey of the departments uhm asking them what they thought their students needed to do when they left cegep sort of based on the four skills do they have to be able to read or write or listen or talk  uhm and compiled  i was going to say tried to compile  it's not we just tried  we did compile it  it wasn't easy   uhm and came up in fact with two families in the technical side of it  so the pre-university at our place we have uhh science de la nature science du word langues communication   who are all in one family together  in fact they may not see each other because uh   because i'll explain why in a second  on the technical side uh there is one group which is uh civil engineering mechanical engineering electrical engineering uhm industrial engineering computer science and geomatters uhh partially because it made sense and and in computer science's case they said that's where they wanted to be  so fine that gang is going to be together and they will get a course quote unquote adapted to what they're after  and then sort of what's left over goes together  it doesn't make a lot of sense in all cases but it happens to be  metiers d'art which are people who are going to be jewellers and sculptors and uh i don't know what lutherie  is in english  i've never looked it up  it's people who string violins and things like that  anyhow those people all those metiers d'art   uhh sois infermier uhh   word h&circumflex;telier uhh  technique illustratif et technique de word au bureau  are going to make one happy little family   the only fine thread that joins those people is they all have to manage something whether it be office workers or patients or pieces of wood or customers  because the people in metiers d'art are going to end up as self-employed people uh in the uh in that field  so that's how our family came up  so that we work with next sem  semester next year and uh we'll see how it works out and die in the trying or come out successful  uh the other problem that complicates all this so there are four there are four levels so you've got   you've got to get families together then you gotta   have got to decide how many levels will you have and the other complication is that there are chalk sound starts in the general program four semesters in the technical program six semesters  chalk sound stops uhh and it could be in our sem  semester in our case it could be in any of those semesters  for example students in uhh human science could have chalk sound starts the first course there and the second one chalk sound stops there and students in civil engineering could have chalk sound starts their first course here and the second chalk sound stops  one there and the people in nursing chalk sound starts have their first course here and the second chalk sound stops one there  uh this also creates a bit of a headache  uhh question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   uh a coup couple   one cegep garneau in quebec city made the decision the only way to really manage this is to put it right at the beginning  s and it ma makes   it it makes a certain amount of sense  although there are other repercussions that are really not good for students but anyhow  so garneau has put the cours word   in first semester for everybody and the cours propre  second semester for everybody  it's much easier to manage  uh it means that students have to do their comp   their elective courses in only in   second year things like that  uh but that that's what their decision was  that was their route  uh our cegep went through every program and looked at the program and some programs said there's no way they can do the course the english courses in the first or second semesters they're much too busy getting in the program so put it later  for example in in nursing it's  in seme semester in the third and fourth semesters   okay  or some people said our students are traditionally weak in english we would like it in two and four because we know a gang is going to fail in the second semester they can make it up in the third semester so they won't be h be behind in the fourth semester  so but there's all sorts of considerations  uhm at our place we're   every cegep i would think had to teach all of these courses as of the fall   uhh garneau is teaching all of these started as of january  uh we're teaching four courses in the block b to the students who are in the general side   the students in communications and languages at our cegep have other english courses to do in in the third and fourth semesters so they had to do it in one and two  uh so that's what we're in to at the moment  and it's it's this fall where  the the other gang is coming that's playing on people's nerves to put it mildly   uh what else   so locally the cegeps can decide how many families  locally the cegeps decide what the learning activities are in block b  uh locally cegeps decide where the english courses go  and locally cegeps can decide uhh if there are cours de formation sp&eacute;cifique in the given program  at at our place the ones that i think that are left are in languages in communications in uhh office management technology and two new programs coming in hotel management and  food services and restaurant technology  so it's all put together   okay   question   maybe a bit of a a few words about the philosophy of of this approach which has been  applauded by some and shot down and screamed at by others  uh and unfortunately the ministry has not done a very good marketing job of its of its new approach  uhh well it hasn't done any marketing job 
Canada	 you're right we   in a sense everyone's a teacher right  in a sense everybody teaches something and that way why did you become a teacher  because you enjoy that and it's something that you want to do you want to share  and that's good you know   that's a good thing  but we sometimes we confuse you know  the uh the idealistic point of view of teaching compared to the down to earth   uh you have a teaching position teaching okay  and in my there's there's a bit of truth in both but it's it's a very different thing   and when you start teaching and you sign your contract  okay you're dealing with a contract you're dealing with a job  you're dealing with uh responsibilities  you're dealing with many many responsibilities in what  you have to deal with  and in my opinion it's my word you're dealing with a workload okay if you consider everything which is virtually physically impossible as a first year student teacher   if you take everything into consideration  you don't walk into a teaching position snaps fingers a teacher   you know you don't walk in knowing how to deal with discipline right away snaps fingers   you don't walk in knowing how to deal you know with supervising  you don't walk in snaps fingers knowing how to deal with the meetings with parents  you don't deal snaps fingers know how to deal with the union  you don't know how to deal with uh uh the direction with principals  you don't know how to deal with the other teachers   you don't know how to deal with this with the students  you don't know how to deal yet with the uh psychologist how to deal with the nurse how to deal with the w social worker   you don't know how how to deal with the secretary which is an uh artform in itself laugh audience laughs  you don't know how to deal with evaluation adding in  all your your all your marks into the  the computer to make sure you understand the computer  you don't know all the rules of the school   you don't know all the rules of the union okay which is a very complicated document  you don't know all the rules dealing with what are your rights and what  these things take an awful long time to learn   compared to just walking into a classroom you know  to just walk into a classroom and have you know thirty kids in front of you and know what to do for an hour or you know how to deal with it   so i think what it comes down to what i what my  point is is that okay you signed a contract you're after the job interview you have all this work you wanna  want to gotta got to deal with uhm  you have to think of what are your priorities   okay  so when you start teaching as a full-time teacher okay e s l teacher in a high school what would be your priorities  what would be your first priority   audience member responds   get to know the students   okay  what would be yours  different audience member responds   behaviour problems  same audience member responds   to know how to handle behaviour problems  same audience member responds   okay that would be your number one priority or two  same audience member responds     sentence with students  i think it comes down to that  knowing the students  sure elementary school  what would be yours  different audience member responds   how to teach   okay what are you gonna going to   be what is gonna going to be your teaching strategy   same audience member responds   good  same audience member responds   okay  and what would be your yours word   different audience member responds   mm hmm  same audience member responds   heh right  same audience member responds   sure  same audience member responds   mm hmm  same audience member responds   do you mean kinda kind of like the levels  according to their level or  previous audience member responds     same audience member responds     word   how do you imagine your first day of teaching  how do you imagine what do you think it's  gonna going to be like   if you had one word to describe what the first day of teaching is gonna going to be like what do you think it would be like  different audience member responds   nerve-wracking okay  different audience member responds   three words laugh audience laughs   but really what would be yours uh  previous audience member responds   your for your first day of teaching word   what would be your first way of describing first  what would be the first word   same audience member responds   mm hmm  same audience member responds   yeah but how do you how do you as a per   how do you feel towards it  what is your what would feeling about it  if i say how do you feel about your first day of teaching  what w what word would you say would describe it  same audience member responds   very nervous  okay nervous  you are extremely nervous  and do you think you're gonna going to  have all your material  different audience member responds   there's big chances you're gonna going to  walk into the classroom with your kids with nothing  it's nice to say that your first day of teaching's teaching  but you m have to give this as your first thing  they probably will not have their material  and this could go on for a week  okay  they might not bring any paper  they may not bring any pencils  this is very possible   i'm just giving you a kind of the scenario  so audience mumbles   you have no   you have to kind of give yourself a worst case scenario   because what you want my my uh my broth my  one of my brothers is the president of a company okay  and he has one sign in front of his desk and it says no suprises  audience laughs   and that's sort of what you have to think of  you want no surprises  there will be  for example you might have a list of students fifteen students  ha ha i'm laughing  fifteen students  they made a little mistake you actually have thirty kids  they just forgot to put that other section on your sheet  audience laughs   you know i'm really sorry  well they might not say they're sorry but anyways audience laughs   you know let's let's you know deal with it  so these things may happen   so i'm gonna going to tell you  what to do for your first day of teaching  take it or leave it okay  what what i would do for my first day of teaching  first of all okay you want to think of an activity  that will involve all the students okay  and that will not threaten the students that has the least amount of interaction as possible  and that will not have anything to do with levels  weak strong  cos you don't know what they are now  they could be a strong group they could be a weak group  you don't know what you're walking into  all you have are names okay  that's all you have  so i'm gonna going to show you the activity that i do  i'm gonna going to do a little game  i'm gonna going to imagine that  i'm it's my first day of teaching and i'm  gonna going to show you the activity that i do  okay  so we're gonna going to imagine that there's laugh starts thirty kids here audience laughs okay  laugh ends   let's imagine there's thirty kids here sounds of setting something up   okay  they walk in   now first of all there's the way you walk in okay   now i'm gonna going to show you  what what i believe is is is  the bad bad way to walk in okay  someone tries to finish speaker a's sentence     replies   hi  hi  hi audience laughter   the word of the year is hi     two words audience laughter     alright guys  first day at school huh laugh   okay   okay let's audience laughter more setting up noises for about 10 sec   it's okay  you don't want us to hurt your back okay   okay you start first of all you  look at everybody word   the first thing when you walk into the class you look at everybody  and you just look at them for a second  and they're gonna going to be looking at you okay  that's the first thing to do  because you're curious about them and they're curious about you  so you look at them   and then write down sound of writing on blackboard  kay okay my name is  mister scott   now they won't say a word   usually they won't say a word sound of writing on blackboard for thirty seconds   i want you to sit okay sit sit okay sit down sit in alphabetical a b c d alphabetical order   for example my name is scott s   i want you to get up and sit in alphabetical order  and then you sit down and you watch them   now they'll start looking around   and right away you're gonna going to  see certain students who understand   so right away you're gonna going to  start picking out your students who are quite strong okay who understand  and then you're gonna going to find your leaders okay  the students who're gonna going to go okay you you sit down you're there   they may speak in french okay  if you wanted to you could really work out the language and make them speak in english  okay if you wanted to you can say sit before me  in the class if you want to okay  but i'm talking about just your crash course okay   so you're gonna going to find out who your leaders are  you just sit down and you just watch them okay  and then when they're sitting down in alphabetical order  first you've accomplished your first activity okay you have them sitting in orer order then you sit down and you take a piece of paper which has little boxes on it and you ask them each their name and this is their seating plan  this is where they're going to sit   audience member asks a question   by their last name     yeah  audience member asks a question   high school   i'd say primary school too you know  i would see it  but this is definitely high school which i used it in you know  and uh  audience member makes a comment   yeah what it is that's cooperative learning right  it's a it's c it came out of cooperative learning when i thought of that idea   and it's it's a lot you know  you cos you see them sharing and trying to you know  work out and you'd find out who your leaders are and you'll find out who's a bit stronger   you'll find out who's a bit confused   and there also and and it's you know what i like  about this activity is there's no confrontation   there's no oh well we're gonna going to  make a seating plan  oh no feigned student voice whining in mixture of nonsense mumbling and quebecois french some audience giggle   and there's no word   okay well what's your name uh  imitates student replying in quebecois french   no i mean there's none of this kind of stuff there's no interplaying   ah then there's uhm there's the  idea of them doing a the the work  they're doing all the work   and then you just sit down and you have it in a place and a face and you know you know where they are  that that accomplishes something  and then then what do you do  now you're still in we're still in our first class right   okay we're still in our first class together   you don't have any material okay we're still in that thing where you don't have any material  so what do you bring  you make sure you bring paper with you   you know if they don't have a pencil then that means they're pushing it  you know maybe audience giggles you know maybe you should bring pen i dunno don't know   it depends on your situation you know  but i didn't have to bring pencils at least but i did have to bring paper you know  so they go imitates student moan   go ah ha you know audience giggles   take out the paper and what do you do for the first class  what would you do as a first class activity   audience member responds   okay what did you do for your summer  same audience member responds some laughter  that's good   audience member responds   write about yourself   good  audience member responds   what would you do some laughter   audience member responds   okay  audience member responds   mm hmm  oh for them to get to know each other  okay   same audience member responds   audience member responds   sure  same audience member responds   good  same audience member responds   that's good  it's a very interesting activity  i think it's a very interesting thing   okay that that that's good     okay now uhm  i'll tell you what i would do okay  same audience member responds   no it's okay  like i like that because it's it's a i think it's a really good idea and maybe i'll try it you know   but uhm what i do laugh starts okay comes down to  laugh ends this writing on blackboard for 5 seconds   we'll do vocabulary okay  why   because your students just came back from the summer okay  even if they're from even if i'm teaching   secondary five you know i've taught secondary five as well   but they just came back from summer   most of them forget all that they learned okay  and and and you know they  they need vocabu   and vocabulary is very very traditional okay  what the students   this is this is an important point   you okay because of of university  you have you have forgotten the rules of education in the sense in the formal rules of education   a student knows much more than you do because they're there in class  they know the rules of the game okay  they know that they sposed supposed   to bring their schoolwork okay  they know that in class we write down on paper   they know that in class do i write with a pencil or do i write with pen okay  they know these things   they know uh vocabulary they've heard that before  you know we're gonna going to do vocabulary   we're gonna going to look at english words and you're gonna going to you know  study these words  they understand that   audience member makes a comment   sure   they they know the word  vocabulaire   they understand okay this is the word and i have to study this word   they know these things   they know placement   they know a seating plan   they know they've had that before okay   so i do vocabulary because it's something that they know   and you want to start with something they know   you want to gain their trust okay  cos when you have the trust of your students then you can have a great time   then you can start doing very interesting activities  you can start   but if they don't trust you they're not gonna   going to do that much for you you know as a teacher  cos they wanna want to know if you're a good teacher or are you a bad teacher   because they have to deal with you   you know they know good teachers they know bad teachers  they know with this teacher they can do whatever they want  they know with that teacher they can't  they wanna want to know what they're  gonna going to do with you okay 
Canada	 they wanna want to know that   so that's why if you look at for example us as e s l teachers  in our specialty we have a uh an extra  complication to our first year of teaching in the sense of that we've worked with the communicative approach okay which is seen as something   which you which is a very open approach  it's something very uhm  you deal with the interests of the student  you learn with the uh ah the emotions even  you deal with it's a very personal kind of thing  it's a personality kind of thing okay  and to be able to obtain the communicative approach you have to break through you have to get to know the students on a real level  okay  but in order for them to trust you and to let them know  show you who they are as a person you have to gain you have to es to establish  that base of trust okay  you have to establish that  and i knew this from traditional teaching that you establish that trust and then the more as time goes on   then you know you can start de doing  new things and doing interesting things  so for the first teaching class for the first class i believe in a very straight traditional ah class in which the students learn vocabulary okay  and you say next class we'll have a test on all of these words   so they'll have to study okay  what does that mean when you give them a test on vocabulary   it means they're gonna going to come home  and then have to study english  and mom and dad are <-gonna going to say what are they studying  vocabulary  ah laughter   audience member speaks   eh  same audience member speaks   what kind of vocabulary   classroom vocabulary   teacher desk   things that you're <-gonna going to deal with in the classroom  same audience member speaks   yeah word good  that's what you want   you know you wanna want to do in-class  vocabulary   so that's the first class  audience member asks a question   sure  same audience member continues the question   yeah  same audience member continues the question   you see yeah   th it's it depends on how you look at it  same audience member responds   okay  uh i see it from the point of view of the first class   maybe it has it has a lot to do with learning but it has more to do with procedures  okay     responds   and the idea of of going okay let's give me the ten words you know well then you're dealing with the idea of maybe they're <-gonna going to say they don't know anything  same audience member responds   and i'm looking at it from the point of view of a   of you're going in there and they know zero and you have to teach them english  same audience member asks a question   at first yeah  at first   and then you more and more as time goes on  we're just talking the first class eh   we're talking you gotta got to keep that in mind that   audience member comments   maybe not  don't be surprised   same audience member comments   audience member comments   yeah  audience member continues comments   right  audience member continues comments   you're gonna going to  ye ye cos then you're dealing with confrontation  audience member responds   you don't wanna want to deal with confrontation  you wanna want to deal with you're a competent teacher you know word   audience member comments   right  audience member continues comments   right  audience member continues comments   and then the day and when you have that test you're gonna going to see if your class is strong or very weak  audience member continues comments   cos you'll be surprised  cos you'll have a basic vocabulary test and i can tell you could be secondary five   cos the vocabulary that i work with i'm in secondary one and two but i've taught secondary four and five and i worked with primary vocabulary you know the text the text  they give you and a lot of them don't know it   audience member continues comments   and that's not a bad thing  i'm not trying to shock you or oh my god  this is this is  vocabulary  this is some know it some don't   and i think it's a good start you know   uhm but ah the the thing that i'm ah  the point that i'm trying to get through is the trust   because they wanna want to see if you're a good teacher or a bad teacher   you know and and you have to get  that that uh that trust is very very important uh   audience member comments   mm hmm  audience member continues comments   yes  audience member continues comments   mm hmm  audience member continues comments  $a> no  audience member continues comments   definitely  audience member continues comments   w well okay that's a g  the the difference is between night and day really  the difference is between having an efficient class in which you're able to to uh teach and students to learn compared to a class in which ah you're dealing with discipline problems all the time  ah you're trying to to you know you don't have the you don't have the control of the class    you know y y y  they don't listen to you when you're speaking  you don't have respect   you know they walk all over you kind of thing   you know the first year that i was teaching uh the first day  the first group i had was a strong group okay  this group had a eighty percent average since secondary one and they were always together  and i had them in secondary five   but i didn't know that okay  they always told me that it was a strong group strong group strong group  but you don't know what a strong group is when you're starting  you don't know what a weak group is once you're starting  and i came in and you know and makes a clapping noise  this and you know my heart's jumping  and uh my activity was a flight activity  i don't know if you're familiar with flight  it's a communicative approach book  it's a good book   and the first one is t the first activity is take off you know  and and it's uh it's  a thing where they take you you cut these little numbers and then you give the kids the numbers and then the kids  take the numbers and they go into groups   and it's about key words and they have to take the groups and then they come in front of the class and  it sounds wonderful awkward laugh   and i was with a strong group   and uh they walked in and the bell rang  and like one guy comes in right after the bell rings and goes  drrrrr-ring voices the noise of a school buzzer   and he walks in and i go hey hey don't be late hey  don't snaps fingers be late to my class audience laughs   right away you're   and they're like whoa you know  yeah like right away i was like jumpy you know   right away i was very strict and like audience laughs  three or four words   and then they then they did the group thing  and then it was like free-for-all you know  it did you know because they don't  they don't understand the procedures of the class   it's a complicated thing teaching you know going into groups  and and you know it's a lot of ah class management   so uh my first day of teaching was like that you know  and i didn't have the m i didn't have the method so i photocopied everything  you know they didn't have method then so i photocopied  all the all the work that they had  then my next group was a very very very very weak group  okay  so i thought it went well for my first class you know  sure they they you know it was free-for-all and word   but they were nice kids you know  they were like you know they were all like   kids of teachers and things and they were like  they're having fun with me but they're you know   they were nice basically   but then i went into a tough group okay  and this group laugh starts okay in secondary laugh ends three and  have you ever heard of french expression    have you ever heard that expression  have you ever  well it means that they're students who who  have uh ah l at least two years of ah uhm  yeah of of snaps fingers uh   they're behind at least two years audience can be heard mumbling in background   yeah they're weak students   now what they did at my school was i knew about   french expression cos i had a course in it   audience laughs   and i asked them at the job interview i said am i teaching the french expression and they said no you're not  but what they did in my school was they just took off the word  audience laughs   you know no we don't have word  audience laughs   but of course all these students were in that before  someone in audience mumbles   pardon  member of audience makes a comment   yeah surprise  it was a big surprise  they were only nineteen students but it's like having a class of you know it's a big yah  and they they just like ah  you know i tried to speak and then they just say jokes to each other and then   right away it started off bad  you know two or three mumbled words   member of audience asks a question   well ah if you do have   it it really depends on the students that you're with  but what m my my feeling is  okay any group of students can be disruptive  you know they can be really great with one student and they with one word one teacher excuse me and then they could be really disruptive with another  member of audience responds   any group of people eh   like if you think of a riot or anything it's you know if you think of psychology any group of people can become something you doh don't   so there can be thirty against one  you can look at it that way   you know thirty against one  and when you're in that kind of confrontation kind of scene  you're a loser  you're gonna going to lose   okay and it's your first day and you don't wanna   want to get into that you know you  and n n what i what i  enjoy what i think is good about this actually is that you don't there is no confrontation  okay  if you say take out your okay write this down now there's no confrontation  you are teaching that's all  audience member comments   some may some may go oooh but  it's just the way it is  you're a teacher and you're tea   teaching you're stating a fact you know  same audience member continues comments   you're not there t you're not  wor you know   you're not trying to scare them   you're saying there's going to be a test on this  tomorrow   member of audience makes a comment   a quiz  same member of audience makes a comment   member of audience makes a comment     that's right     that's right  yeah you're trying to get that idea of uhm uh ah like that it's a businesslike attitude  that that is my my  way of of looking at it for a long time  we're in the business of of of them learning english  and the main thing is that you wanna want to  establish trust okay  and what you want to work with is what students know already  okay  so uhhh when you start teaching in the first few days   whatchoo what you wanna want to   look at is what the students know already   it it could be vocabulary  maybe it's something else   maybe you will have the bo the books   right away you know  but maybe uh what i'm trying to tell you is before you start that book you know before you think about how you want to teach  your teaching pronounced 'steaching' strategy   cos that's the most important thing  how you want to teach  and think about it hard  don't trust you know all this stuff around you  you have to find out what are you going to do here   on my first day i i think i wrote down everything i was going to say okay  like my my lesson plan was i think five pages long you know  and it it you know it goes down as time goes on  but it's just you know you're so much   and there's nothing wrong with that  i i don't think there's anything wrong with sitting down and really thinking about it you know  but uh i think it's it's to me  what i like about the idea of not having any confrontation at the beginning is that's what helps you to uh to   establish a relationship based on learning and not based on a power trip  and that if you do that then you're  gonna going to you're gonna  going to   even if you don't uh become very popular  even if you don't become the friend of the students or the most popular teacher you are going to have a long-term good teaching relationship with your students and you're gonna   going to feel good in your job you know if you're good as a teacher  because you're doing what you're sposed supposed  to be doing  and you're not gonna going to have to deal with a lot of emotional things you know you have to go through  uhm that's what i i want to talk to you about after i'm just gonna going to get into uh the identity crisis and what am i doing here anyway okay  nervous laugh   what happens is that uhm you you because   you you have your diploma your teaching diploma and you have your job and you have your workload and you start  thinking you're a teacher uh but you're not a teacher but you think you are   you're going through an identity crisis okay and you are starting to go oh what what am i anyways and who am i  and you're going to start questioning yourself as a person  okay  and a lot of this is when a lot of  people have burnouts you know your first year burnouts 
Canada	 it's just sort of here it is teach it tough  uhm if you know what's going on you can understand it and you can interpret it  uh since i was on the writing committee i can i can  give my teachers information  other places it's simply well this is it i guess  we'll this is what we're supposed to do   one of the reasons that the ministry went towards this we were told is to move teaching away from being teachers that are just student-centred  so that this is what the students are supposed to learn  that's that's sort of the message of these new programs  it's okay what are the tea teachers  what are the students supposed to learn what are they supposed to do rather than okay i'm a teacher what am i gonna  going to teach   uh it's really to sort of turn it around so that it's the student   who is the dr driver who is driving the course rather than well i think uh that this is what uh i'd like to teach rather than this is what the students need either once they get into university  and in in the creation of the families  our questionnaire was for the students in the general the  pre-universe pre-university side was okay not what do your students need english for in the cegep  that's not what the courses are for  once they get out of the cegep and into university what are they going to do in english  and at our cegep they said they are going to have to read and they will have to listen to things but they won't have to write and they won't have to speak very much  uhh the technical side uh was more varied once they were on the job market they will have to write letters in english and maybe make   job propo uh job proposal contract proposals  they will have to phone up eight hundred numbers in california and figure out what the person is saying about why this machine doesn't work  uhh that sort of thing  so with that feedback uhh i i think we can  come up with some courses that will will suit their needs   when they get to university they they will have to r read textbooks in english definitely the resource material and all the rest of it but it would be uncommon unless they ended up at mcgill or concordia or something that they would actually have to write papers or anything in english or that they would have to speak at in any depth in to anyone in english  so that's why the people said when the students get to university yes they have to read lots of stuff in english and they probably have to maybe listen to tapes and videos and that ah or maybe a guest speaker or something but they won't have to produce in english  so so that's why they're  it was very much a a few words   ah another thing behind another concept behind   the new courses uh was and there's been a great discussion as to what the translation of comp&eacute;tence is it   is   is it competency or proficiency or you know pick a word out of a hat sort of thing  uh the aim was to to come up with an outline for a course where students would actually be able to do something when they finish the course uh as in be able to speak to someone be able to write something be able to read something as opposed to saying the students will will be able to manipulate six and a half verb forms in uh two voices and i don't know what  uhm so the the aim of the course   is is not n is not grammatical accuracy  that's part of the game  that's one of the ways we can judge whether the text is acceptable  but but it's certainly not the  the only thing   another pandora's box is evaluation   uhh evaluation  and again it is up to each cegep to come up with what is called  and if you have friends who teach in cegeps uhh it has either been dealt with and they're now reacting to it or it's going to be changed  chalk on the blackboard noise   it's what called the p i e a which is the  politique institutionnelle d'&eacute;vat  d'&eacute;valuation des apprentissages   so each cegep so it's institutionnelle each cegep comes up with their policy for assessing evaluating learning   uh and as a further step to that the cegep comes up with one and then each department can add things to it that they feel are specific particular to their own department  uh it can say things like students must attend all their classes but could could miss up to seven hours  and that's okay  our cegep has a different policy uhh which a lot of us don't appreciate but anyhow it says what it says  it says that students are not obliged to attend classes  uh it seems like a weird way to put it but anyhow that's what it says  uh so each cegep has its own p i e a and they write out a list of things as sort of this is how we evaluate students  uh and it could be things like there must be at least three tests through the semester uh no test can count for more than forty marks or thirty marks or or whatever  so this p i e a goes through the whole list of what you can and cannot do and how students are evaluated  obviously with this change uh in courses by competency this has to be redrafted  some cegeps have done it  ours is in the process of doing it   what the ministry has said is chalk on the blackboard noise  it's sort of it's pass-fail but it's not pass-fail   that's about what they said  what they've said is the course description here if a student  does that they've met the objectives a pass mark is sixty that gives them a sixty   not if they've done sixty percent of what's there but if they do what's there that's acceptable that's sixty  and then the ministry said okay we've done our work the other forty marks go ahead  each cegep whatever  so uhh it should be interesting  uhm so each cegep is going to come up have to come up with some sort of policy as to okay now how are we going to do this  uh the students have reached the competency uhh so they get sixty percent but what if they reach three levels and not the fourth on can we still pass them  uh or what if they don't get quite all of it uh do we still give them sixty  uhm and these other forty marks is it for term work that they get the forty marks or is it because they do more than is expected here on the final exam and it's only the final exam that counts   uhm in the past if students fail in the sense that there were x exams and you totalled the marks and they got fifty-five they failed  that's it  sorry  you cannot come and wash my car and buy me chocolates and take me out for dinner and redo your your composition which was garbage  sorry you got fifty-five that's it  it stops there  with the reform and the competency-based curriculum  theoretically if the student misses it they have another chance to do it  the problem is so when's the other chance  if you test them on the fifteenth of december and they don't have it  then what's the process for letting them do it again before they have to start another course on january seventeenth   uhh to all these questions there is no clear answer at the moment  uh each cegep each department is trying to come to terms with okay so what do we do with the forty marks that ah  that we have control over  uhh based on the competency theory you wouldn't sort of give them five marks for a bunch of homework they do every second week  that doesn't seem to fit in to the competecy - based  competency-based program  uhh it could be based on a certain number of test word  every semester  uhh it could be bonus marks on the final  you write a composition it's as described here you've got it if it's even better than here i'll give you five extra marks  uh they're all questions that de that local departments are grappling with   uh one strange story that that came out in a cegep is say for example you give your students an  exa give them four exams during the semester and we have this student who gets he's just passing gets  six on each exam  so that gives him how much chalk on the blackboard noise   for the semester's work right  and they have a final exam based on the competency and they write and they speak and they do all the rest of it and they do it fine so they get sixty percent  right  they they either get nothing or they they get it  so they get sixty percent for that   so this chalk noise starts average student ends up with a mark of chalk noise stops eighty-four uhm  audience laughter   anyhow it's uh   question   that's that's the problem with what we ended up with  if they do this they get sixty  figure out the other forty  in the meantime university was saying well so what exactly does a mark mean now  uhm ask me in two years is about all i can say   uhm the other thing about evaluation in the the  law with the uh for the reform the ministry has said that it can impose if it wishes what's called uh  une examen uniforme read provincial exam and   in any of the four uh disciplines in formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale which means french english philosophy or phys ed  so if the ministry decided it wanted to have a common english exam across the province they could do it  uh same for philosophy for phys ed  they have already announced that there will be a common exam for french uh or for in english in the case of english language cegeps  uhm the term is langue word et litt&eacute;rature   that means mother tongue okay  so in in for example our cegep we know there is going to be a french exam common across the province  uhh d the uh timetable's been put off i think by the by a year  i think next year cegeps can do it if they want to but it doesn't have to be done but i think it's the year after that all the students have to do it and that will also be uhm  they will have to pass that to to get  their their dip diploma   question   at the moment no  uh the only reason i think they would move is if they see a major variation and there are cegeps doing this and there are cegeps doing that then they're going to say okay everybody let's come together  affirms a's point   at the moment no  i i haven't even heard anything  so i would be surprised  question   no cos it's not that there's an emphasis on it  all four are there  uh if you speak to anyone across the province i'm sure they'll tell you there's too much work in all these courses rather than the opposite  that's the major cry  it's how can we possibly get through all of this stuff in forty-five hours   uh the other thing is that it's not that  uhm say for example the four skills are are   at this level okay it's not that they that  that each one's worth twenty-five percent  they're all worth everything as described  okay  at this level it's simply give the general general i  general meaning of the main ideas of a text of about  five hundred words  they don't have to go any further than that  so if they can do that they've got it  and it's if there are chalk starts four elements   of of the competency they've got that that that and that they get sixty chalk stops   it's not that this is twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five  it's there's no attribution   of a of a percentage to any of the things  that's it's sort of get it all or  word   okay  so it's it's uh there's certainly not  any more insis uh emphasis placed   on pr on the comprehension uh  actually there's more on the production  there's much more  uh the standard is more defined and more demanding under production than is it it is under the comprehension skills certainly at the lower levels   ya  question question  question continues after interruption   it means you all have a better chance of getting a job  audience laughs   ya   no  and so are there more jobs   uhh at our cegep we hired seven new people last year uh and actually four of them moved from montreal to word   uhm this year we're looking at hiring and some of them have already been identified through the uh interview process last year  we're looking to probably hiring around twelve for the fall uh and seven of those twelve will will be a full-time will have jobs for the full year   five at the moment seem to be only for the fall semester   uh and for example when i mentioned at berbeau in quebec city they did all their hiring last year cos they they  implemented the whole thing all at once 
Canada	 they'll probably hire one or two more teachers cos there are a certain number of students who have failed and and  there's that population who will exist in that volume  and it's really very much each cegep  uh to to find out you'll have to phone every cegep department head and say are you hiring how many  uh it's it's i know it doesn't sound like a lot of fun but that's really  the only way to find out for each cegep is to find out  what they need how many people they need   uhm montreal uh may need fewer teachers in some cases than uh outer lying regions because already more students took english in the first place when the departments were proportionately bigger in montreal than in other cegeps  so maybe in montreal a cegep well some cegeps may increase their department by a third whereas we're increasing by uh almost probably two thirds  there was there were eight of us before  we'll probably end up being twenty-four twenty-five english teachers  by the end of next year   question   uh  question   minimum  a b a a bachelor of arts   how's that   uh each again each cegep there's are a lot of things that each cegep can do and that's another one of them  each department uh sets its own selection committee and establishes its own criteria  uh for example one cegep could decide okay we're not taking anybody who doesn't have an m a in tesl  okay  and that's that's their privilege  if that's if they feel that they can do it i mean they can do it  uh if if they realize that they need seven teachers and there are only five available it wouldn't make a lot of sense  uh but uh that's  and the same thing for the le the years  of experience  uh last year our minimum was three years teaching experience putting all your experience together  if it totalled three years full-time fine  uh i think berbeau put their berbeau put theirs  at five years teaching experience  question   again that could be up to the cegep  they might say we want x number of years teaching in the cegep  which would not be an intelligent thing to do because it's been such a stagnant field for so long i mean there just aren't a lot of people out there  it could it could weigh in your favour during an interview for example  ah you might get higher up because you taught some courses in a cegep  uh that might play in your favour  but essentially the basic minimum is in a cegep you have to have b a in the field  and again the cegep could decide okay we want a b a in e s l  that's it  or other people might say we'll take a b a in e s l or maybe another second language uh and maybe translation and english lit   question   uhh b ed  question   depending on what  well it depends what you call a b ed  okay   and and that's that's  one of the problems  last year uh we advertised in the gazette in montreal and in the soleil in quebec city  uh we're also advertising again this year on april first this saturday uh in the gazette and soleil  uh we got four hundred and fifty c vs  uh probably two out of the people should never have bothered wasting a stamp because they had no experience of any  it was just uh here's an ad audience laughter   you know  but i mean it's understandable in today's economy  then we had to go through it and and  then we'd see degrees b ed and if it wasn't very clear what the person did in the b ed it we got a little frustrated sometimes and if it wasn't clear well if not that clear then well if not that pile over there   question   we were favouring a clear c v audience laughter   acquiesence   okay  becau because   no we didn't favour b ed over   no cos we simply we want someone with a bachelor's degree in the field of that is  applicable to teaching english as a second language  uh we didn't restrict it necessarily to english second language  if someone had a b a in french second language with the applicable experience in english second language and  we went through we went we read the c vs  it wasn't simply we looked at the degree and if it wasn't that we threw it we ditched it  it was if it was clear  sometimes people would put down uhh nineteen ninety-four nineteen ninety-five taught english at mcgill   well that's not a lot of help  was that five hours when someone was sick  was it uhh three three night courses for four semesters  was it one night course for one semester  uhm if you're preparing a c v make your experience clear enough so that when someone's reading it it says something to them  that that certainly is some advice that i can give to you word   i've read an awful lot of c vs  uhm so there are jobs out there yes  uh montreal generally seems to have hired not a lot of people last year  so i would presume uhm   i shouldn't name any cegeps  uh i was talking to a friend last night at one cegep in montreal who did not hire any english teachers last year but i know they are hiring this year  so i think more cegeps in montreal are hiring this year than they did in la in last year  but it really is uh phone up either the personnel department uh human resources in the cegep or phone the language department and find out who the the language department head is   and and ask are you hiring what's the procedure  i don't want to bother you but please tell me the procedure and i'll hang up fast   question   presumably that should work  response   ya  uh  question   how many cegeps are there  there are forty-seven in the province  in the montreal area there must twenty   so  uhm uh for sending them out uh what happens  i can only tell you what i do at our at our   cegep  question   if a c v comes to me i send it downstairs   uh if someone phones me uh i answer as much as i can  briefly  uh i tell them to send their c v down  uh and we've actually says it in the ad  any c v that we rec we received as of december first i think it is they're there   question   oh ya  it's not that we've we've thrown everything out and if you don't answer the ad tough   uhm we did decide to ditch what was before december first uh because there were there was we felt there were  a certain number of people that applied in the fall and may not be around and if they were still interested either they would reapply or see the ad or or something  s and and again each cegep may have their own pol policy   some cegeps uh may decide we have two hundred names in this file we're not advertising we're not advertising we don't want another file  especially in montreal  we don't want another five or six hundred  so a lot of cegeps you may not see an ad at all and you really   should contact them   tries to interupt   they may simply say hey we got tons of people here   question   ya  they should go through it ya  yes  question   i didn't even think of doing that  they're uhh discussion between a and multiple audience members   laugh one strange thing that i didn't know uh at all since i've been in this in this system for a long time is that when when these seven new  peop these seven new people we hired went down to human resources and got their experience evaluated so they  they could get paid according to the scale it turns out that that year of eighty-four eighty-three whatever it was when the  ministry of education did dirty things to teachers and  and uh  one of the effects of that law in addition to cutting salaries permanently by twenty percent uh and things was that nobody who teaches in a cegep gets experience for that year   they don't care if you taught seventy-five hundred hours at mcgill uh that year does not exist for experience at cegep  apparently  there you are  uh i can't tell you what the salary scale is because i don't know it by heart  uh you can con ask anybody who works in a cegep  they have a copy of the collective agreement  the salary scale is in there and it's the same for everybody across the province  there's no  except uh there are a couple of cegeps that get extra money because they live at the end of the world or work on boats or things like that  but uh generally the scale is there  it's based on two things  you're what's called an word   as judged by the ministry of education  uh they misjudged me but they don't believe it  uhm and then by your years of experience  and they take they go across the top okay we recognize seventeen years of schooling and you have eight years recognized of experience that's how much you get paid   question   uhm  clarifies stance   ya yup   the only thing that counts differently is what they call   exp&eacute;rience professionnel   for example if you taught a business english course at mcgill or in a cegep or somewhere where a student's got a credit for it and your friend taught exactly the same course you both used the same materials and they taught it uh somewhere else where it wasn't credited as a course  it would take them like about five times more of those hours to get the same experience credited as you would  so there is there are two levels of experience  actual teaching credited courses counts for a lot more than courses you may have done under other circumstances  but they have this whole file  you dump them with all your contracts and they've gotta  got to go through it   question   have some very clear english uh french language explanation of what you did   okay  uh if you simply said i taught e s l in asia for five years   they will they will simply say how many hours under what circumstances was it credited  question   no not that it's good but did you teach it to students who got a credit for taking it   that's where the game is played  okay  question   ya by ya   okay  uh  offers own perspective   okay and they presumed that since it's at a university it's credited  response audience laughter   i won't tell   alright the only reason i'm saying is cos i know at our school there are two teachers who have been teaching for ten years in different circumstances and one person got something like five years recognized and the other person got four   uh and the uhm it it   seldom happens but this year a stra  something strange   because we hired seven people at exactly the same time we have seven people who are on the same footing for what's called  anciennet&eacute; for their seniority  so uh now things will start playing oh you got six point four five eight and i've got six point three nine seven so you're ahead of me for whatever that means  whether it means in some cegeps it may mean   you get to choose your courses before i do  in some cases it may mean you  anyhow whatever it may mean  but uh sort of those extra four or five words mumbled in some point in your life word   question   none whatsoever   uh the selection committees uhh are  in the collective agreement uh there are five people in the selection committee  you may be surprised to be interviewed by five people but  uh but you will be in most cases  the five people in the selection committee are three teachers  uhh  so in our case it's department head which is me and two other teachers uh and then there are two people  one from human resources and one from the directeur des &eacute;tudes   okay  so they'll be five there are five people   that read through them  so essentially if you're sending it to a french language  institution uh it might make more sense in french because there are some of them that may not read english that well to look at it   question   clarifies question   uhh i've said this too i've said this too many times but it's a local decision  understands   uhm at our cegep what we decided to do once we got through a whole the c vs last we ended up with a list of ninety people uhh and we invited the ninety people to come for tests  there was a written test in french  there wa there were one two  three sections of a written assessment in english and there was an oral assessment in english   okay   so yes there was a french a  a written french requirement   question   yes  question   no it wasn't   uh actually it was uh the the test was part of the test was taken out since it was not  because people wouldn't be teaching in french  but we felt that since our institution is a french language institution one of the things that happens in our department also is that  uh people secretaries uhh one after the other so the person has to be able to function in french 
Canada	 so it was at that level   and in the  question   be able to take minutes in french at a meeting  uh to be able to read anything the administraion will throw at you  if you want to make ah a submission for a project you had to be able to write up your own project in french  i mean there are people around who sort of help you with things  but uh the person   uh and there were a couple of people who were certainly very competent very qualified would have made probably very good teachers who weren't hired because we felt they couldn't function in french   anything else question answer period with multiple extra-corpus speakers   uh the other interesting thing about evaluation if if   those of you who are interested in it  a new thing that's also coming is what's called une &eacute;preuve synth&egrave;se uhm comprehensive exam i guess is the best thing  uh it has never existed before  uh now it's brought in and again the date of when it must be applied has been pushed off a year or two  i think it's now nineteen ninety-seven  but when it is applied students who are enrolled in a program  at if they're in a general program at the end of the two years in addition to having passed having to pass  all the courses required there will be a comprehensive exam  based on something and if they don't pass that comprehensive but they've passed all their courses they still don't get their dip diploma   this is something very new   question   then presu presumably   the theory behind this is that they miss it so you so someone who has evaluated them will say well this is where you were weak so why don't you go and take another course in stats and then you will probably pass it next time or this is where you're weak take this this and that course uh extra courses i don't know  what read this read that  uh it's not very clear   uh so it it and what was even more interesting is that originally what we heard was it'd be based on the  formation specifique the real program courses but apparently no it's also to include formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale english philosophy french and phys ed  now how that's going to fit i have no idea   question   no  the &eacute;preuve synth&egrave;se because it's evaluation is going to be local  question   yup   uh already the re there's a team of two people in our cegep going around or thinking about this rather and they've come to see me once and sort of well you know this is what we're thinking about how how do we possibly do this idea of a comprehensive exam on the program and also throw in english french philosophy and phys ed  uhm anyhow  so that that's somewhere in the offing also   so if you talk to teachers across the cegep level you may find some that think this is great it's a it's a good time to rethink what we've been doing it's a wonderful challenge i can create new things  you may speak to other people who are looking for a pet  itself  uhm there are there are people who are very frustrated very angry in some cases  i'm sure everyone is very tired  uhm there are problems uh  it's a holiday of change  how do you how do you deal with change  do you see it as a positive force or is it oh change was there a change  i mean i had to do something different with my courses this year  uh and there are people who say change no change not me  uh so it's uh it's a very intersting challenge   and if you're interested in working in word  send in your c v laugh audience laughter     but if if you're into there are certainly jobs out there but it's really a matter of finding the right person in the cegep finding out what c what's going on  and what the procedure is and what the deadline is  okay  thank you very much applause, m c closes the session and draws attention to an upcoming event   it star registration starts   in the evening on wednesday  i think it's seven seven thirty  and then in the evening uh the person who is in charge of e s l at the cegep level in the ministry bruce wallace will be speaking and giving an update as to what's going on   uh the provincial coordinator for e s l at the cegep level is paul fournier who teaches at henri word uh in montreal will also give an update   uhh on thursday there are workshops in the morning  there are people coming i believe from university of ottawa uhh essentially on evaluation  one is reading how to re re  to do do re-evaluation   there's one on oral evaluation  i forget the third one  uh there is uh the registration fee is something like fifty dollars if you're a member of speak if it's before march twenty-fourth which it isn't  but uh anyhow   uh in the price of it breakfast there's a continental breakfast and lunch is included  uh there's a wine and cheese at the end  in the afternoon there are workshops  uh a lot of them based on multimedia  there are some uh there's a commercial presentation on some authoring programs  i've been helping with them  uh there are a couple of people doing things  speaking about ah uh using internet  uh there are people talking about how to create and use a multimedia lab  uh and there are a couple more  those are the afternoon sessions  question audience and speaker a responds   the easiest way to get information the fast   phone the speak office continues with a group discussion until tape ends   these galleries are in chronological order  so it goes from the oldest art in this room  uh in fact this is the oldest painting on the wall uh right here  saint catherine of alexandria  it was made in thirteen twenty  and then as we continue really following the perimer   perimeter of a large rectangle then we follow ah more or less this chronological history of art  so we go from the oldest gradually to the newer around the other side  so what i thought we'd do is start in the second room ah with a mid-fifteenth century work by uh hans memling  so it'd be over here tape cuts out   so this is a painting by uh hans memling  it was made for fourteen ninety-two  if you look later on you'll actually see the date inscribed in the painting itself  ehm we we have to remember that when we're looking at a painting that is five hundred years old uh of course  this painting was not made for us and uh it certainly was not made for an art gallery  mostly cos that concept didn't exist a place to come in and just look at works of art  uh and it certainly didn't have a label beside it giving us  all kinds of information  so instead for the mostly illiterate people of the time they would have been able to look at this painting  i know there's writing on the frame  but just by looking at the painting itself they would have been able to understand certain things  in particular they would have realized that the man who is kneeling is also the person who's paid for this painting to be made  can you tell me what detail about him would have let us know that he's paid for the painting   answer to question   ya   can you see what he has around his waist  it's kind of a belt and there's a uh a  kind of purse or a bag hanging from his ehm waist   so can you and if you look really closely   you see the purse is in fact open  can you see any mon money  inside   answer   why not  answer   that's right cos he paid for the painting  so it's very clear  this is typical of the renaissance where uh we see these images that are really quite close to everybody's daily lives  so every object is there because it has a specific meaning  he's being presented by his patron saint who is saint anthony abbot uhm the bearded man  can you see what objects he has with him  word   a cane mhh hmm   answer   pardon me  response   ya   can you see the pig or the wild boar  points out element of painting   and a bell  exactly   so uhh the way he's dressed the cane the bell and the pig are all the symbols or the attributes of saint anthony abbot  ehm does anybody else know who those other two figures are  this is a christian image so can you guess who they are  answer   mary and jesus  uh does anyone know if mary usually wears red like that  no  what does she normally wear multiple responses from audience  blue right with white  so laugh does she wear any blue here multiple responses from audience   ya right  so no she wears the blue right against her body but she wears the red  uhm people say it was a symbol of royalty and that therefore it tells us that she's represented here as mary queen of the world uhm but  it's also the symbol of divinity  you can see that the image of christ just beside is wearing a red  so that's why she doesn't re wear it right against here  so it's to show that w she's born an ordinary person  we also see that around this time there's a system of perspective that has been developed because what we have is   uhm the idea of painting is to convince us that this is not in fact a flat surface on which there's different paint uhm on the surface itself but rather that this is a space and we're loo   really looking at this painting as if we're looking through a window out onto the world  so we have have you done any perspective drawings at school   answer   ya  ah do you know what perpective drawings are  answer   answer   yes  answer   ya exactly   so we don't want this to look flat  we want it to look three dimensional so you can see the lines all move towards this vanishing point  do you see the floor in particular   right  where the tiles quite large in the foreground and as they move towards the background you get towards the vanishing point because all the lines will eventually converge  in fact if you look at this painting you can see that the ehm  lines ehm converge at about the top of jesus' head  you see that the baby's head   so that in fact it's leading our eye to him who is largely the most important part of the painting  uhm if you look at the background uhm you can see that kind of throne   who is that attached to or linked with   who does the throne belong to   hmm   it's mary right  why  how do we know it's mary's throne  answer   cos of the colour right  the red in the throne links it with the colour red she's wearing  ehm and you also see some fabric as part of the design of the throne  do you see a fruit in particular that is part of that  uh ah the fabric design   answer   there's the apple in jesus' head the uh  hand uh the symbol of redemption  but there's also a fruit that's part of the fabric design or the tapestry design  ya the pineapple right  laugh so the pineapple was actually the symbol of hospitality so the artist in representing that was inviting the   ve viewer us the viewer to look at the image  so what i'm just trying to give you an idea of very quickly is how even though these images are quite realistic we hardly see the paint brush stroke at all every thing is very well painted each object is there because it symbolizes something specific and we call that the iconography  have you heard of the word icon before   where do we see or have icons now   answer   ya in windows  in computers right   so if you think of what an icon does on a computer you click on this little sign right or little uhm design and each one represents something else  if you think of the painting it's exactly the same kind of system  each little object whether it be the cane the pig the pineapple has a specific symbolism  does that make sense  a little bit  yes  okay so uhm just to give you an idea generally of the language of painting at the time this is a flemish painting and they were especially strong in different iconography  ehm also at this time you would have never had ah an ordinary  portrait of a person by himself uh but only in such a painting that you call a donor painting 
Canada	 when the person who paid for the painting is actually part of painting itself  does anybody have any questions  mhh hmm   question   the red  wha what   clarifies question   ya it's just part of the throne and it links it to mary  so but if we think of the colour red or blue and if we think of how people uhm got paint those days  you know they obviously didn't buy it at their local art stores  where would they have gotten the colours to grind in for the pigments   what would those come from  answer   ya they would often come from fruits or vegetables and dyes but the ones that were to last really long would also be from rocks and minerals  right  have you seen very many rock red or blue rocks  in your lifetime  no  they're among the most rare pigments  so it would make sense when they when they're   making paintings like this that they're going to reserve these more  rare colours for the things that have the most important part of the painting themselves  so we'll see these colours again in the painting ah soon  any other questions  mhh hmm   question   okay i'll show you  it's uh just right up here  it's kind of scratched in the painting itself  so as we ah go to the next room you can take a closer look at it   any other questions  no  okay tape cuts out   just going to explain a little bit about how the lighting system works   uhm we're actually going to go though this way  uh you can see that these skylights open up directly to the to the well allows them the light to come directly into these galleries   so those blinds underneath the skylights just are uhm connected to a computer that limits the amount of light that comes in  so if all of a sudden it gets sunny then the blinds will close quite a bit  uh so it's all regulated very specifically  as we walk through here you're going to see circular windows  the same type of skylight exists on the other side of this wall only in this case it's to allow the natural lighting to go all the way down to the canadian galleries underneath us  so that's what we're going to be seeing through these windows  tape cuts out   so i'll begin by talking about the price of this painting  not because i think that the price of any painting is of particular significance but i can hear you all talking about it and the first question i was asked was how much is it worth and i believe it's worth about four million dollars  how much we paid for it uh the national gallery paid one point seven eight million for it a few years ago  and it was pretty much the purchase of the painting ah that received a lot of attention because this painting was hanging in this room for a couple of years before and nobody took much notice of it and then uh the gallery finally bought it and of course it meant for probably the first time in the history of canada uh people were actually talking about art  so uhm i'll discuss a little bit why this painting has the market value that it does and then after that i'd be glad to answer any questions that you have about that particular aspect of it  okay  so barnett newman is the name of the artist  he is an american artist  he was born in nineteen oh two  he painted this in nineteen sixty-seven  so how old was he then   sixty-five years old at the time  he died three years later   and uh today in nineteen ninety-five he's considered to be probably uh the most important artist since the second world war  he only did about a hundred and thirty-five works of art in his lifetime  and so you can imagine that there are many art galleries like this one whose mandate it is to collect art that's considered important in its time that want to collect works by him and others who worked uh in new york around the same time  so does that answer your question about the market value itself  you know supply demand uhm  just like a pair of nike running shoes or a hockey player  right  it just depends on what people want to spend  how many have that talent or how many are th   there in the world and it drives the price up  alright   answer   so ya   that moves us to stage two  you are probably wondering why this painting suspected speakers not recorded   you guys just want to listen at the back for a minute  i'm trying to explain it to you  you might be wondering why uhm this very simple looking painting  is considered so important  right  or why the artist who painted it is considered so important  it looks so simple  anybody could do it blah blah blah   right  okay ehm so what i'll do is i'll take you back further than nineteen sixty-seven  i'll take you back to nineteen fifty-one or nineteen fifty-two when that little painting over there was painted  can you imagine living in that time and seeing a painting like that  how do you think that was received by the public   answer   pardon me  answer   answer   boring   what comments do you think people would have made  answer   plain  i could do it  my grandchild could do it  right  things like that  depending on how old we are my little brother et cetera  so we have to wonder why an artist forty years ago or fifty years ago would decide to put such a simple painting in the world  right  i mean he obviously uh he didn't get very much  or he didn't have very much support from even other artists  jackson pollock whose work is over there was about the only artist that supported him  i won't give you too much of a sob story of the starving artist but apparently he actually did have to sell things that he owned to put   art food on the table   so why did he do these simple simple paintings  one of the reasons was he wanted his paintings to be for everybody  so if we think of how a painting can be for everybody then we will not ask in front of a painting like this what does it represent in the same way that we would ask that question in the painting that i just showed you  right  and i very uhm you know uh gradually told you what the other painting represented  the cow or the pig represented this or the uhm pineapple represented that  so every object had this specific meaning that was hidden from us as twentieth century ah canadians let's say  it was really made for fourteenth century flemish christians the last painting  this painting we're not gonna going to   look at the meanings behind it but in fact we are actually going to look at the painting  and that difference is really i think the the  most crucial thing to to realize when we look at this painting  so what i'm going to suggest is that we actually look at this in a very specific way  i'm going to give you instructions to look at this painting  does it do you mind doing that  i do it just to save a bit of time in and i you know we want to see van gogh and other things as well  so would you mind following my instructions for a couple of minutes   kay okay i promise you i won't make you look at the painting for longer than two minutes  kay okay   could i borrow somebody's watch to ensure that i'll only make you look at it for two minutes  okay  whatever   laugh okay  i'm timing you  i would like you to look at the blue stripe on your right hand side for the entire two minutes  so we'll start   interrupts   that's okay   no no i'll just look at it  so we will start now tape cuts out   we'll just focus our eyes all that time just on the blue to the right  the red's gonna going to try to creep in a bit but just keep refocusing on the blue tape cuts out   kay okay one minute has gone by so we'll look at it for another minute tape cuts out   there are thirty seconds left  they're the the most crucial thirty seconds tape cuts out   so what happens to the blues multiple audience members respond. speaker a engages their thoughts   is anybody still looking at the painting  does the whole painting look like it's coming off the wall  multiple audience members agree   laugh so see what i mean the difference between looking at the painting and looking at the meaning behind it  right  ehm i just choose that as something specific just cos i know  our time is fairly limited but i promise you that if anybody here spent twenty minutes in front of this painting with an open mind it would do pretty incredible things  the only thing is is that we live in a society even more then when this was made twenty-five years ago that we expect to get something really quick  right  so it doesn't dawn on people to look at it longer than just to say okay it's three stripes and go onto the next thing  so uhm when i do that  it's just certainly one way to look at it  it's not the only way to look at it  but i know that it gives you a pretty dramatic uh effect  so that's just one thing that i choose but i certainly don't   wanna want to give the impression that you know you have to have these special instructions behind every one  but did you like that experience  was it cool   okay  so you can see that you have to be here for the painting to work  you have to be open to what it has to offer  if you spend twenty seconds looking at this work which is probably more than a lot of people will spend looking at it then your experience is going to be much different than if you actually sit down and give it a chance  right  so what we realize is a lot of what we get out of it it comes from within us  so if we're open to what it has to offer then we'll get something  if we're just you know worried about how hard it is to make from a technical point of view we'd probably be more impressed with the person who laid down this floor  you know  uh we don't know the person's name but it's true that person has a lot of talent and was probably chosen pretty carefully because of his technical skills  with art although the technique is often important some artists feel that to accomplish their idea the technique might be  more simple in some cases more involved in others  it depend pends   depends really what kind of things they want to get across or what kind of idea they want to get across  any comments or questions   no   question   pardon me  repeats question </o  in a sense   you know i choose that because it's probably the most dramatic one  and and so it gets across the point really clearly  if you look at that one it does neat things too  it's a little bit more subtle  but uh certainly also in in the nineteen sixties there were a lot of artists that worked with optical effects and were interested in that effect  i'd say with barnett newman what makes him a little bit different from many abstract artists is that there's ah he offers you a little bit more  it's laugh hard to explain a little bit but there's kind of ah a subject there or something uhm i'd say more moving in his works than some of the op art that is just optical illusions although i realize that i just showed you an optical illusion  i said there's other ways of looking at it too   okay   any other questions comments  mhh hmm   question   kay okay why don't we take a look at it  we'll what we'll do is we'll stand up in a certain area and we'll all look at it together tape cuts out  and around this area so that we're in front of this  painting uh sculpture   so if you're towards the centre you'll probably have the best point of view   kay okay so my first question to you is is this a beautiful work of art audience responds  no  so the artist obviously made this so we would have some kind of reaction other than an aesthetic one  you know we're going to look at it differently than it's a piece of wallpaper or a new pair shoes 
Canada	 right  we want to get something more meaningful out of it  so i'll ask you does the image remind you of anything in particular  response   the crucifixion  but of course you only see the vertical part of the image  right  would you like to see the horizontal this cross is completed   responds   laugh okay   it's just one way of pushing that even further  but can you see how this sculpture is on a base and we uh barely see the legs underneath the base cos it's slightly recessed   but it creates a space between the base and the floor  see what i mean by that  and how it's filled with a shadow   so ya just let your eyes focus on that shadow  am i in the way for some of you   okay i won't move   for let's say five or ten seconds then we'll look up at the vertical beam for another few seconds   do you want me to get out of the way tape cuts out   optical illusion but you should see a faint white line that completes the crosses  see what i mean   have most of you seen it audience responds affirmatively  okay  makes a point   laugh actually it works really well if you  crouch down but   kay okay so we'll come and we'll look at it much more closely tape cuts out   uh well when we get up close you can start you see the surface of the sculpture  you can see that it's rusty  it's made out of core tin steel  and we actually uh also see this pronounced rusty line  right here   what does that make you think of   the blood right  so uh if you think of what i just did i just asked you what you saw  i sure that i pushed a little bit further by having you look at the shadow but what you just told me comes from you  i didn't say this is this this is this  so again just to reiterate what i said before what we get out of these works depends entirely on what we give to them  if we come to this with a background completely foreign to christianity then we're not going to see this as the image of the crucifixion  right  you're going to see it in a different way  uhm i think one of the s sad   things about this painting is that it's true we bring our background to the work and many people just brought this huge price tag with  the with them as the background and they could only look at it as a consumer object  so they they never let the experience go beyond being a shopping centre right where you're surprised when the price is more expensive than you thought it would be  so uhm you know just look at these works i'd say and the artist made them for you was hoping that you'll probably get or that you'll get something out of them  so it's really up to us and the more we have to give the more we'll get out of it  does that make sense   you have any questions   okay  ehm we will continue into the impressionist room tape cuts out  so we're in the room with uh impressionist and post-impressionist artists  this is a painting by uh vincent van gogh  have you heard about him  ya  do you know anything about him two audience members respond  uh laugh i think the story goes i'm not sure how  or the legend goes anyway that he sold one painting in his lifetime and uh that was to his brother or something  or his brother was an art dealer anyway   makes a point   ya it's true he did a lot of self-portraits  he did a lot of his paintings within just a few years  anything else that you know about him  makes a point   i don't know  i guess you only know the price when it's sold but one of his paintings sold for ninety-eight million  kay okay   so uh it wasn't it was bigger than this  this is on paper  but uhm you know like ah once you get into the millions there's not much difference between laugh fifty million and eighty million right  makes a point   ya you know in those days people were just labelled as insane and lived in institutions  you know he ch chopped off his ear  all of these things that are the subjects of movies and  and books audience members discuss amongst themselves  he didn't sell anything   it's actually wi it's wi   around this time where you have this break  or the this beginning of this idea about the artist starving and alienated from society instead of the typical artist  and that's why there's been so many movies and books written about him because he he lives kind of this quintessential uhm alienated artist life  but all of this is aside in a sense  but i think that it's all related because uhm when we look at his paintings more than the memling we just saw in the first   in the second room or other artists i think with van gogh somehow we get a sense of that it   his paintings capture his personality or we have a feeling that we know the artist himself through his art  and i think it it uh the reason why is perhaps uhm a useful way of looking at his work   for instance when we look at the grass growing in the background is he copying exactly what he sees repeating the same angles and trying to  medicul meticulously copy nature as it is exactly   no  right  but we s what we get for the first time is the artist deciding himself mostly hes at this time  implied comma what this painting's going to look like  so we have this subjective view  uh in this case the uhh each paint stroke   coincides which with a blade of grass so it kind of makes sense  but for instance if you look at the stems here you can see this blue outline  irises don't have blue stems right or blue outlines on them so we can see that the artist is even though he's inspired by nature as a subject matter he's deviating from it  he's deciding to in this case be influenced by japanese prints  that do have these black or bold outlines  so artists go for other to other sources  to make their art  also with van gogh you know we just spent a few minutes talking about his life  did we talk about hans memling's life or barnett newman's life not so much  with mo with modern art or i guess not barnett newman i shouldn't use an example but the renaissance artists we're not so interested in their lives but with modern art when we look at their paintings we f concentrate   on the artist's personal vision and or their ideas their style rather than the subject matter  i'm not going to go on for five minutes about what kind of irises they are and what time of year they grow or you know the specif  the specificities about the subject matter but we're more interested in how it's painted  and that's basically something that we could generalize with all modern art is we're interested in how it's painted more than what is painted  does that make sense  ya  so ah any questions about van gogh  the reason it's under glass is because it's on paper and uh it's a fairly fragile support  the paper has been mounted on canvas  so it's it's fairly secure  we have two other paintings by van gogh in this room the  flowers on uh either side of the far wall tape cuts out   somebody asked to see a picasso  who was that   anybody  nobody's owning up to it  did somebody mention picasso as an artist they wanted to see  audience member asks other audience members a question  okay   i guess i made that up  okay laugh   anyway ya laugh here's laugh a painting by uh pablo picasso  actually ehm we we've just   phrase   ya okay  get's a's attention   good  i'm not losing my mind laugh   uhm we've literally gone full circle and uh i mean in the galleries but also in the history of art   when we started with that painting hans memling the renaissance painting where all of these objects were meticulously painted i said that the ideal at that time was to pa to treat a painting as if you were looking through a window outside of the  wor in uh sorry outside into the world  ehm so you would substitute the window frame for the painting frame and you got this feeling of space  what we get with picasso is it's as if it's the same the same window is literally broken  so all of the sudden we see these flat planes that are intersecting and it creates a surface all of its own with its own interests  it's not trying to pretend to represent trees or forests or something that exists in the world but it's a surface that has its own entity that exists on its own  i having said that uhm there are certain elements that we can recognize  the title of this work is the small table  you see any elements of this table audience members respond   ya maybe the legs or something here that  ehm you see part of a guitar audience members respond   ya  i'm thinking more of here are the strings and then the upper part of the guitar up here  see the wallpaper on the wall behind it   ya  there's see the wallpaper back there  and then these letters are they are they   actual letters or are they paintings of letters   is there a difference between letters and paintings of letters  no  cos letters are a two dimensional sign for something  right  so there's you can't it it there's  no difference really  so by putting letters on the surface what the artist is saying this is a flat surface on which these things are signs  so it's it's it's a way of treating laugh ah well  interrupts a   so he's saying i'm not trying to say this is a real bowl of fruit but this is something on its own  gets a's attention   it's paint on a canvas  so it's affirming the fact this is two dimensional and it's not this space  you know we're looking at this in nineteen ninety-five  we just saw barnett newman's voice of fire which is totally  flat and has no object represented or depicted in it at all  so we have to think of looking at this in nineteen nineteen where this was quite new to see these spaces and ah forms represented in a completely new way  so generally we i guess we could call this a cubist painting although uhm something like that round one is ah a much better example of typical cubism tape cuts out   i'll bring you back down into the canadian galleries  we'll just quickly pass by the chapel rideau street convent chapel   i'll show you where it is anyway  and then the group of seven and then uhm what you can do is find the elevator from off there  do you know what how to get there  tape continues as a conversation between a and a few members of the group    i'm working here at the museum  i'm in the education department  and we're gonna going to be doing an exhibition today called rights and realities  you've got the uhm word material for it so you've at least seen some of the slides and you know a little about what you're going to look at  kay okay we're going to break it up into a cou a couple of different ways of one going through the exhibition and two talking a little bit about work that you're doing yourselves combining this all in  it's really nice having a small group cos i like it to be really informal  so as much talking back and forth  if you have questions ask  you know i'm ya i like to go off the track sometimes if there's something about the exhibition or about something in photogrqaphy that you want to know more about  first thing i'm going to do is tell you something about the c m c p canadian museum of contemporary photography this museum  have you ever been here before   so this is all your first trip  alright i can give you some background on the institution cos that helps you understand what the collection is all about  cos we have ah a collection that's really split into two really distinct uhm categories  that being uhh documentary photography and what's considered art photography or experimental photography uhm using different mediums  other photographic style and genre  originally in nineteen forty-one uh c m c p was part of the national film board and everybody knows the national film board  uh it is the still photography division which was very important  it was a unit that went across canada documenting the country  it was one of the best methods that canada had for selling canada to immmigration post-war immigration and it was also a way of solidifying a real canadian identity or fostering an idea of a canadian identity  in terms of because of the expanse of the land people out on the west coast were able to see photographs from people on the east coast and so it brought communities together 
Canada	 ah this continued  we continued with being part of the n f b national film board  until about nineteen eighty-five and then in eighty-five along with  a number of different cutbacks uhh the entire collection at that point was put into archives and the entire institution was shut down  i mean people continued to work people continued to acquire uhm pieces for the collection but we didn't have a home  there wasn't anywhere to be  so they started work building this place  and first of all it took uhm about five years to find the location  this location had been an old railway tunnel which is why  architecturally it's this design very long narrow and deep  uh it runs from what used to be the uhm train station which is down  word centre out to the big  have you been to the national gallery word  today  okay  you know that big bridge over there uhm the princess alice or alexander  i can't remember what it's called  anyway you know that bridge it all hooked up  it's all tied into one  so our collection as it stands now  this building was opened in uh ninety-two  so it's relatively new  the collection has about a hundred and sixty pieces  it's black and white colour slides uhm print images in some installation pieces  cos there are a number of artists who are working in photography as insallation pieces  uh we have an acquisitions budget annually about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars  uh it's a small staff who works here  it's nothing like the national gallery which is this huge staff which is  it's a big institution and it's very hard to get your work into that institution  uhm we have people coming in artists da  almost daily with portfolios having assessments done by curators  so we're very accessible  uh and often it's a lot more fun to see you know  you know young artists coming in and and  the stuff that they've got  now as a result these two exhibitions that we have rights and realities and the one in the next uhm gallery called dialogue which after we're done with rights and realities you're more than welcome to go through and take a look at uhh fall into a real journalism documentary style  we don't have really anything that would be except for this piece here that's done by the uh group word  culture uhm it's the only piece that would be considered  modern or experimental  uh some of our earlier uhm exhibitions in the summer and last spring were more contentious a little more bizarre a little more  interesting in that more art vein  uh we're going a little bit to try we have to try and balance and do a little bit of each style  uhm also because we're trying to target different uhm people   who to come in and see the uh exhibitions  now uhm any questions about the museum  anything that you're really interested in about it  okay   who can tell me what journalistic photography is two minute question and answer discussion with extra-corpus audience members   okay that's you're getting the right idea  essentially uhm journalism is a photographic witness to something that's immediate and it's a very short uhm exercise  uh there's there's very little preamble and there's very little follow-up  it's just the one image  with documentary uh you usually have it working more like a study  so you'll have people working for maybe a number of weeks months even years on one subject so that it really ends up becoming a text itself  it has this notion of a beginning a middle and an end  and it can be accompanied by text but not necessarily  it often goes into a book form or a magazine form  and it's more of a large format deal  uhm but the approach is almost the same  you you are recording and recording is the thing that's most important  it's keeping a record and keeping track of some event or uhm a culture or a group of people or a community   now what we're going to look at with rights and realities is  a bridge between the two  in a way it's documentary but it's more like photojournalism  uh the project was put together by a man named david barber who worked for cida  does anyone know what cida is   canadian international development association  it's located here in ottawa  it's a federally-funded institution who goes around worldwide  usual usually well predominantly third world project building  they go into uhm villages in let's say zaire and put in uh project leaders to help build water irrigation systems and uhm put in for education uhm healthcare uhm agriculture uhm political development designing infrastructures for countries that have gone through war and don't have   an infr like a a political or a social or urban infrastructure   they design all these for them or with them  not for them but with them  uhm so cida is always going around with photographers taking photographs of their projects using it for their publications  so there's already an interest in photography there  then in order to get more funding cos these things always cost a lot of money they went to an institute that's in montreal called the international institute for human rights and democratic development  has anyone ever heard of that seems to be an unrecorded audience response   no  it's a pretty new group  but has everyone heard of amnesty international seems to be an unrecorded audience response   okay  it's very similar to amn amnesty   international  it's a watchdog group  they look at different countries  they they pinpoint areas where human rights are in conflict and uh where they're being violated  so then they came to us here at the museum because the person or the project leader wanted to have this group of photographs curated by uhm an institute well shown by an institution but curated by someone who was professionally involved with photographs from a purely uhm aesthetic technical point of view  someone who wasn't involved with the issues but just with photographs because all too often when we use project people to choose images you get clich&eacute;d images  does anyone know what i mean by a clich&eacute;d image   what is it  answer   right  and why what's the purpose of a clich&eacute;d image  answer   mhh hmm   kay okay that's on a positive side  we could also look at this as being a very manipulative way of  changing people's getting people to think a certain way    it can be very manipulative  and the one thing that we have to remember about photographs  are that they are manipulative and that while we have to  certainly abandon a certain amount towards believing what we see as being real always remember that someone took the photograph someone made a selection someone chose to uh put something in the frame and someone chose to leave something out of the frame  so you should always come to any image with a really healthy questioning about okay why am i being shown this picture how does it work with the text what's missing   like what am i not seeing  cos it's so easy for us especially photographs in black and white uhm to just believe everything  anybody tell me why we tend to see journalistic photographs in black and white   there's a couple of reasons   answer   cheap ya cheaper and easier is very true   what else   how do you react if you see uhm images in colour or images in black and white particularly these images something shocking   answer   right  answer   which the colour or the black and white  the black and white   uhm i think maybe what it is that with colour uh you tend to be more dazzled by the colour than by the actual image so that if you see uh an image of someone lying dead in a pool of blood in colour it's very graphic and we desensitize ourself to what exactly is going on but you see that same image in black and white and you have to really look  and you have to think about the image and actually think that this is a person lying dead in a pool of blood and how graphic it is   how graphic that's made in our mind as opposed to how it's made graphic on the page  right now if word magazines like uh maclean's canadian publications like maclean's use a lot of colour for all their news stories but then their news stories if you look if you go in and you look through maclean's you'll find that their news stories  tends tend to be pretty one dimensional and fairly flat  colour for them is just fashionable  colour is very fashionable right now in terms of news  it'll pass  but black and white will always stay predominantly the uhm medium of choice for most photographers uh just because it is more gritty  and you know how everyone says uhm it it's   in black and white  it's black and white is the language of contract  it's written in black and white   that gives it this idea of real and legal and uh believable uh trustworthy so that that'll last  now this particular exhibition has six photopraphers  as you're aware  all women   all but uh one of them cindy andrew is in fact is a photojournalist  she lives in new delhi  her husband's a uh print journalist  they both cover mm uh southeast asia  uhm she does most of her contract work for the globe the globe and mail: canadian newspaper but she also has is  within an agency  so she does freelance  the other five women are predominantly documentary people who work in both photography and film and video  uh they work on projects for uhm non-governmental organizations uh government organizations uhm international governments as well as uhm our own canadian government  so they tend to spread around  all of them have done shoots in foreign countries have done shoots that involved looking at communities and projects although not necessarily in the country that they've shot in for this particular exhibition  the exhibition is current  uh they fin finished   they went off to shoot last uh march  they finished shooting march april may  it was a two-month shoot  uh it cost eight thousand dollars per person   they shot off about a hundred and thirty sometimes a little more rolls of film  so one way or another there're about two thousand roughly two thousand images per photographer  uh cida kept about uh a hundred and seventy-five of them  the rest went back to the photographers which in a way is payment uh cos they didn't make hardly any money uhm doing this job  it was more because it was a really interesting project   but they can then use their photographs  they can sell them  they can re-use them  they can get some income from them  so it's not it's not too bad  uhm what i want to do first of all is i'm going to have you read  the introductory panel very quickly  it tells you what's going on what the whole project's about  cos what i want to do more is look at the photographs  not so much the issues of what they're photographing but how they're photographed to make you understand or not understand as the case may be  so we'll start with this and then i'm going to introduce you to the first photographer and then i'm going to let you go spend about fifteen minutes looking at the other photographers and then  i want to get back together and talk tape recorder stops   one thing i'd like to go over is how this uhm exhibition is curated  it's always important to when you walk into a gallery or where anywhere where images are being hung it's it's so  look at the images but to look at how the images are hung and think about why they're hung in a certain way  uhm often there's a reason  uhm sometimes it's just aesthetic  sometimes it has more to do with uhm a political statement or it can be any way of of communicating an idea that the curator or the artist is trying to present outside of just the image  so first of all what we've done here is we have a very brief  biography on the photographer but we've also included a photograph of each photographer 
Canada	 and in this case stephanie colvy is the woman in the middle  and what this does is all of a sudden you get to see the artist  and all too often we see what the artist does but we don't really know what the artist looks like and and often it's nice to be able to look some sort of have some sort of  intimate relationship with the artist just based on the way what they look like and form an opinion based on their face and their the character that they have cos that helps you understand and maybe see aspects of a style or an aesthetic or a a feel that comes out of their work  next we did a blow up of   does anyone know what this is   contact sheet   so it's a blow up of a contact sheet  and what we wanted to do was make sure that people who visited  the the museum who don't really have a close relationship with photography understand how photographs are taken in this sort of uhm style  so the one thing that we notice is that that   these are not posed images  they're not one-offs  they're not constructed images  so what you'll do is you'll end up using a roll of thirty-six  and as you can see in this section from sixteen down to about twenty-seven she's just shooting the same sort of thing over and over again waiting for the sun to change waiting for shadows to change waiting for people to come into and out of the frame  as you see in here just getting whatever she can sort of in  you want to be able to pick up the natural rhythm of a person's day as opposed to jumping in and disrupting them by taking these contrived  images of them  so photographing this way takes a really long time takes a number of hours  often and wi with most of it well all five six photographers were in agreement it would take them at least an hour before they even started to shoot an image  in some cases cough it wa it took uhm cindy andrew seven hours before the women that she was interviewing would let them take photographs of her  so you really have to be interested in your subject  you have to really have uhm patience and a really clear idea of  getting to know the people based on who they are and what they're doing and really taking the time  after that you notice all the photographs are once again in black and white  we do we have one image that's in large format and the other nine are all in the same eleven by fourteen sixteen by twenty   and this is the way the show's curated  now what i'm going to do  do you have any questions about just this portion that i'm showing you right now   okay  what i'm going to do is i'm going to give you uhm an activity sheet  but you don't have to fill this out  it's not like go to each question  it's just when you're looking at the photographs and when you're thinking about making these assessments and you know and putting these relationships together you can use this in some cases just to remember things uhm look at different ways to look at the image  it's more like a guideline more than anything else  but if there's anything that occurs to you about something you can always i mean jot it down something that if you want to remember so we can talk about it later  so that's all this is   so i'm just going to give you these   let's start off let's just pass it all back word  there  and you can have some pencils too just in case you do feel  like you want to  cos all too often we come and we look at images and we intuitively ask the right questions and make the right conclusions and judgements but sometimes you know in this sort of situation you sort of miss one or two things   great  i've got  that's here and also this is an evaluation  we're starting a little  at the end if i can get that back from you that would be great  response   now what i'm going to do is let you go into the galleries   all rights and reality is in this right-hand gallery and uhm it starts here after stephanie colvy's with uhm sheryl albuquerque here and then you just follow it all the way around going sort of to your left  around and around  okay you're on your own for a few minutes   so i'm going to give you about fifteen so maybe a few words oh about twenty twenty to well twenty to two recording shuts off   now then we've all gone through the exhibition i'd like your impressions of it  what did you think of the project and then the idea of this  as as a project conversation with extra-corpus speakers, two minutes, forty-five seconds   uhm it's always easier to look at images that are  pa ah that are exotic because one you're   you're looking at things you don't always see and you're looking at people who you know  i mean sure we see asians and and we see latin americans here in this country but we're just seeing them in circumstances that you don't normally see so you can suspend your uhm relationship with them  but then when you see the images the canadian images that's  how did you relate to these  how'd you claire beaugrand-champagne  what do you think about her photographs   asks for clarification   the montreal photographs  answer   the one thing too i i want you to know that if if you hate something say i hate it  you don't have to like it just cos it's hanging on the wall  like that's not that's not how it works  uhm if you really don't think something is effective or you don't like a photographer's style tell me because in some cases well i'll agree with you  and and it's important cos that's how we make decisions about what what we like and what we don't like conversation with extra-corpus speakers, three minutes   okay  what about uhm if i said uh cher  cheryl   ya  what if i said that cheryl uses uhm uh photographic metaphor   and if you use look at the photograph of the kids in the tree would everyone look at that and read the text that goes with it response from multiple extra-corpus speakers   ya okay  that photograph is really a metaphor  and in in the same and you can use metaphors   f uhm visually in the same way that you can use metaphors  uhm in speech so that you can have that same way of constructing meaning  that the same way that you can construct a metaphor out of words in a sentence you can construct a metaphor out of images in the frame of a photograph  and if you look at that one in particular what you see is a little girl knocking sticks out of a tree with a little boy sitting up in the branches  and then when you read the text the text tells you that by age eleven she's going to be married and as he uhm gets older he's going to assume a more powerful role in the community and will probably take over from his father as being the sultan or whatever it is of that community  so she is always going to be ah as a woman uh and a married woman in a subservient role to him  he will always be in a patriarchal position to her  he'll always be elevated  he'll always be on a throne  he'll always be above her  so you get from this image uh the whole fact that it's in a tree and trees symbolizing generations and life and sort of ah a perpetuity and the fact that this is a cultural group who are comfortable within their cultural norms   although they are trying the women in these communities are uhm trying to establish certain changes but not massive changes  they like being uh muslims  they like living the way they do  there are just a few things they want to change  uhm so it's not like there's going to be this huge massive  female revolution going on there and a whole change in their whole sensibility  and that photograph works as a metaphor  so she likes to use that  do you see what i'm getting at   okay  what about with uhm iva zimova   what what do you notice about how she sets up her shots  cos partly why i'm i'm drawing attention to this is so when you're taking photographs while you're making images that you can sometimes think about references that references  that uhm make people remember other things that are going to make the point you're trying to get across that much more solid  and that's predominantly what iva does  well i'll let you pick out something  try to figure out where i'm going with this  how does she shoot   answer   mhh hmm   answer continued   mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm   what about the first image the larger image or especially a number of the images that are in the contact sheets  uh you might be able to see them from here  see  so there's some images in the contact sheet in the lower half plus the large image and in particular say the second last image also the subway image  wha what how  are they set up  what's the shot set-up for that   answer   mhh hmm   right  exactly   and so how does that make you feel when you look at it   responses from multiple extra-corpus speakers   well she likes to use movement in her frames  you can see that by people gesturing   so she likes to have this idea of movement that something is actually flowing  there's ah ah energy that's going on in the image  but also when she uses these tilted camera perspectives  it gives you a bit of an unbalanced feeling a little bit  when you look at this you realize that it's tilted so  you're kind of it's knocking you off balance   and it's very subtle but you're trying to you're  you're trying to make your eye straighten it you're trying to fix it but it's knocking you a little off balance  uhm in art history have you studied the expressionists and sort of early uhm eastern european uh say czech modernists uh any of the any of the artwork coming out of pre-war germany  uh late-twenties or late-thirties  does anybody know what i'm talking about  expressionism  okay  do you remember what their what their  uh posters and the their ph their photographs predominantly their posters were like   lots of tilted angles  has anyone ever seen the movie the uhm cabinet of dr. caligari  no  oh if you ever get a chance see it  it's fabulous  but what it is is that uh this whole movement this whole art movement uhm in pre-war between the two wars in germany predominantly was uhm word rise of  fascism coming about and things were becoming more and more uh politically unstable and it was becoming more and more difficult for people to actually make political statements uh political statements came about visually and by artists  and what they did is they created images of their world that were completely off-balancing  uhm so you would have posters around town that were shot funny angles  there'd be a lot of printing cut-out letters lots of uh applied uhm images  but photography played a big role in this  and film work as well  a lot of the early russian filmwork you'll find tilted angles uhm sho uh the uhm funny shots uhm that are out of perspective and then you have t   because it it wants to make you confused  and essentially that's what this style of work was  now when you see a modern photographer  modern like she's in her early-thirties and she lives in canada  well she lives in in kiev at this point  but but coming from canada  uhm using references like this that make you think back to the twenties and thirties in germany and she's talking about something specific 
Canada	 she's talking about how her this  society that she's found is completely unbalanced how it's in a state of chaos and how there's turmoil and the best way to convey that is by making your images look funny as well as the text which tells you the story  but more effective is what you see through the eye and how it makes you feel  do uh does anybody agree or not agree or  do do do you see the point   okay  what about cyndi andrew's work the thai work   now remember she's a photojournalist   so did did you see any difference   in in how she uh puts her images together as  as opposed to uhm let's say fahmida bhabha's  cos they're p cos they're quite different   answer   that's true   if you were a journalist and and you were supposed to go out and take a shot of a crisis situation what would you want to get  what kind of have what would you want what would be the most important uhm aspect of the photograph you were going to take   thinking that you have to go through a roll of film and get it on an airplane or get it shipped out by satellite as fast as possible so it can go into the newspaper by the next morning or even by the end of that day   answer   action and movement okay   and what does that what is action and movement    information   you want to get as much information as possible into the fr into the frame   you want to be able to tell  you're there at at a huge disaster  it's an earthquake let's say   and you've only got maybe a  well you've got a load of film  like you've got a tonne of film  film is not an issue  but you know that your your art editor  back in canada can only use one picture and it's gotta  got to be the picture that has the most information that's telling  the most you possibly can about the degree of destruction the number of casualties the total horror of it all uhm maybe some kind of heroic rescue thing  there's some level of humanity and compassion all rolled into that  so you've got a whole lot of material that you've gotta  got to try to get into one shot  and i think if you look at the way she sets up her large image  it's kind of an i   and the word and the image  next to it the smaller one of the woman in the   in the shanty it kind of gives you the idea of how you go about  putting together that much information   how do you see how she constructs the the   large image   do you have any idea   answer   ya  answer continues   so what we've got is she 's has   this image here this person then there is this person and this person and right at the back there are people  so she really sets up for your eye  your eye is always going everywhere  it's seeing everything that's going on in here  because she kinds of gives you a  you go from this side of the frame to that side and back and forth  so you're really getting as much out of the frame as possible   also shot like this where she's trying to get as much information as possible  the work that the the policemen are doing  the uh street vendors that they are uh involved with   because what they're doing essentially is making sure that the carts don't aren't too much in the sidewalk and it's this whole issue of wh wh where  the road and the sidewalk and the market-area  and then plus the whole idea of just the traffic and the people and the congestion and everyone that's going into this uh bangkok market-area  so it's getting a whole lot  cos we see these photographs here are quite different again  what uhm what do you see about fahmida bhabha's photographs  i mean she's not packing as much information  cos it is a different  it's a different landscape too   but if you think about the gaza strip what's going on there   right now  gaza  is it somewhere you want to go for a holiday supposed audience response: not on recording   why not   answer   right  palestinians   it where uh one of the largest pales uh palestinian refugee camps is  uhm actually what this image talks about is how all of this area here is part of a palestinian refugee camp that's been bulldozed to make room for jewish settlements which are back here  and this is a palestinian woman who's just had her  community destroyed to make room for the encroaching settlements   but what i'm what was great was you said the word tension  do you find that there is an element of tension here in these images   what kind of   answer   uh huh  answer continues   mhh hmm mhh hmm   it there's something combative about her photographs i find  uhm everyone in these images seems very tense and very uhm sort of in your face  there's this kind of tension between people   uh even in the scene of of a wedding party  it's there's something frenetic about  there's something very tight and a little claustrophobic about it  like there's like it could explode into something different   it's not really uhm a relaxed fun kind of time  there's something very tight  everybody's very tight like every one's a little too tightly wound   does anybody have anything that they want to mention about anything they have seen   essentially what i wanted to what i want to point out and what i'm hoping you're going to come away with with this uhm sort of talk is how how to use images to convey meanings  uhm how do you  and this is something that you can use if you're doing art photography uhm as well as this style of uhm documenting and storytelling photography  and to to go in and look also uhm at work that people have done before you  uh photog photography   the history of photography and art history itself is really important because you can use it to your advantage and  makes make your own work uhm speak to things that someone else may have touched on but then you take it one step further  so it can it's always kind of interesting because essentially art comes from art photography comes from photography  it's the same thing  but it's interesting to see how you can twist it and make it your own   uhm if there's no other questions that's it for me   uhm thanks a lot for coming out   get's a's attention   sure  question   mhh hmm  question continues   okay  i realize  question continues   okay uhm i'll talk i'll use cyndi andrew  as uhm an example cos i workshopped with her so i talked to her a lot about how she went about doing her work   uhm categorically she never  if she's driving along a road then she always carries  if if she's on a shoot she has three cameras  if she's just going somewhere uh like out for dinner with her husband she's always got a little instamatic  she's always got a camera on herself somewhere uh cos if something happens she doesn't want to miss it  uhm but in one instance she was driving along  actually uhm not this particular photograph but it came at the same time that she did this particular photograph  she was driving along they were on the road somewhere and she saw uh some ah some kids playing by the side of the road and so they pulled over and she got out and she had her camera and   it's important to be able to speak some of the language of wherever it is you are  that's really important  now they always these women always  went with interpreters  and uh and if you're in this professionally you've always got an interpreter but you  you've got to know some of the language anyway  so she always comes up she introduces herself uh she asks them like what are you doing do you live near here are your family around dah dah dah dah dah  then she says i'm from canada and i'm a photographer and would it be alright for me to take your picture  some people will go ya great   other people will go no  and if someone says no you just don't take their picture  ever  uhm she said that you end up   as a woman you can sometimes get away with taking some shots  that you might not be allowed to take  as a man you can get really hurt  uhm you had to be careful  ah in one instance she took a photograph in india of a cremation uhm but only because she had been a woman was she allowed to get the shot  if she'd been a man they tape ends   one thing that is a constant whatever solution we decide on we all have to live together in montreal  french english ethics we have to live together  there is no choice in that  whatever solution you adopt has to come to that choice   now we've been faced so far with two solutions   one of them is what i call by shorthand the joe clark solution  that is give the separatists whatever they want   make them happy and that way they'll stop audience responds   now ya you gotta have got to admire joe because here's something that hasn't worked for twenty-five years and he still has faith  you gotta have got to admire him  but i don't have the slightest desire to follow him   the other choice we've been faced with is the choice offered by the separatists  that is to split canada off or split quebec off from the rest of canada  the trouble with that solution is that we are not all going to live together here very happily   in fact if the referendum had been won by fifty-one percent and if quebec had separated could you imagine what life would have been like in a place in which forty-nine percent of the people didn't want to be there   and precisely the same problem applies to partition   if you partition quebec if you say okay we feel differently we'll cut off this part of quebec what's wrong with that is you've recreated exactly the same problem the separatists have created   you've got a situation in which almost half the people of montreal wouldn't want to be here   so that doesn't work   i think there's another route to go   there's a  ah you know and and i want to caution you too as i say this do not assume that federation by itself would be a solution  that somehow if we could settle it all and stay united that would cure everything   it wouldn't  we've been a part of federation for the last thirty years  it doesn't strike me that we have been a very happy people as a result either french nor english  so we have to look at the problem a different way   and the way i want you to look at it is this   i want you to to think back to the bible the story of cain and abel the children of adam and eve  cain was a hunter   he had weapons   and abel was a farmer   he grew crops and raised animals   and cain killed abel   there's a lesson in that   in the early days our ancestors ran wild and presumably naked through the woods hunting and carried weapons but some of them learned how to grow crops and raise animals  and once they learned how to grow crops and raise animals they  had to settle in one place   that one place becomes the village   and the people in the village lived together in large groups first because they look after their crops and animals secondly because they have to cooperate with each other   but while they're living together like that in cooperation  they don't like strangers  and the reason they don't like them is because the wilderness is so full of our other ancestors  not my family  but still full of our other ancestors who are wild and hunted and had weapons and who were dangerous and who would try and break in and steal their animals and their crops 
Canada	 some cases what happened the wild people did break in and they subdued the village and they stayed and they took it over and they became kings   and when they did the village changed   the village before had been inward-looking protective  defensive distrustful of strangers but the kings who come to the  ci city to the village  the warriors they organize the people  they make them do things they wouldn't have done by themselves before  they build canals  they build roads  they reach out  they carry trade  they build empires   what they build is the city and the city's a different kind of an animal from the village   very different indeed  the city is outward-looking   the people of the city don't look at themselves  they look out to the rest of the world when they're expanding and viewing   and because they're growing fast and because they're aggressive and because they're adventurous the city has to pull in people all the time new people immigrants   and because it's always pulling in new people it has to be tolerant cos those people are going to be different  it has to accept them   compare that with the village  the village people inward-looking defensive don't like strangers protective   they want to preserve their culture   the city mentality outward-looking aggressive tolerant varied a mixture of people  you'll still find that today  i lived for three years in prince edward island  it's the biggest village in canada   you can go to prince edward island for two weeks  that's okay  you go there to live there they'll never accept you  they'll never trust you because you're from away   they only trust you if you were born there   you leave montreal you go and live in any small village you'll soon find you're not accepted cos you're different  cos in the village they all look like each other  they all talk like each other  they all go to the same church  they all have same ideas   they don't like anybody who's different   city though we are all different   just look around this room   we're a very mixed group  we look differently from each other  some of us talk different languages  we have different values   and we can all sit together as we couldn't in a village because in the city we have to accept each other   if you look at the history of montreal you'll find on the first day the city was founded back in sixteen forty-two  and i hope i got that date right cos i have a terrible time with it  sixteen forty-two i'm sure  they landed about a hundred and some odd people on the water bank right near gibbys restaurant and they celebrated a mass  and you know what the priest at that mass said  he said the most amazing thing   here he's got these people thousands of miles from france   they're in the middle of a wilderness   they're surrounded by hostile indians  if i were giving the sermon i'd say you are here to huddle together and protect each other   this is gonna going to be a rough go  that's not what he said   he said you are a grain of mustard seed whose branches will reach out to cover the earth drawn upon the parable of the mustard seed, matt. 13   think of that   you are a grain of mustard seed you're here to reach out   and the city was planted here not so you could huddle together  it's here because this is where the ottawa and the st. laurence rivers join and from here you can reach into the interior reach out for trade and expand across the continent   compare that to quebec city   quebec city up on a mountain top with walls around where strangers can't get in cough   quebec represents essentially a village mentality  montreal is something a different animal   it's a city   because of its history you find that when north america was explored by the french the explorers usually set out from montreal  this was the place that reached out   and the industry that developed in canada the railway that was built across canada the banks that were built across canada started in montreal  and in fact montreal reached out so far that at one time montreal built the railways of africa   most of them built by sir percy girouard   street's named after his father who didn't do anything   he was lawyer audience laughs   montrealers built the railways of brazil  montrealers built railways in china   montreal was the centre of ocean shipping empire the montreal steamship company  you still see their office down in old montreal   you know a funny thing if you look at the history of elections in quebec you will normally see that montreal has voted differently from the rest of the province   you usually find the same thing word with any big city toronto new york   it's very a very similar pattern   the big city normally votes differently from the rest of its region  think back if you can to all the duplessis years in quebec   when maurice duplessis was premier leader of the union nationale former provincial political party his votes didn't come from here  he got very few votes here  his votes came from the rest of the province   if you look at the parti quebecois  provincial political party look where its votes come  came from  for the most part they did not come from montreal  they came from the rest of the province  look at the results of the referendum   montreal was decidedly no   it was parts of the rest of the province that voted yes  that difference has always been there and it's there it's there because a big city is a different kind of an animal  it has different needs  it has different attitudes  but big cities generally are the prisioners of the political region they're in and you're prisoners of the political agenda of the region   and the region is normally dominated by what i call the village mentality the defensive protective mentality  look at the program of the separatists protect preserve  prevent change   these are all aspects of the village outlook and they're all death to the big city   a big city cannot afford to make its all of its   people conform to make them all the same   it can't afford to be intolerant to difference   but the big cities are prisoners of the larger regions they find themselves in   we are not the first people to notice this   this has been noticed in europe  and in germany for example large cities are given their own constitutional status   they're given their own constitutional powers   they still remain part of the country  they still remain part of the larger region they're in but they have their own powers because their needs are different   you are not going unite the french and english and the ethnics of montreal on separation   you are not going to unite them simply on confederation but  there is a very strong possibility you can unite them on the question of montreal having its own special status in the constitution and its own powers  and its own freedom to develop as it wishes to  and i think that is probably the most useful route that we can explore in the near future audience applause   it is a pleasure for me too because word  thought people who would who are intrinsically motivated won't be asking me what is this on the exam  this is much more fun  just as a as a guideline how many of you already have a business  how many of you are already started or part owner  of a business  okay quite a quite a few  good  okay  and then uh how many are uhm  o ob obviously there must be one word that's started or at least explored the idea of of starting a business  so uhm let's let's get started  uh just to update what elizabeth said about me uh   the flor the florist business i had ten years ago is it still pays dividends in the long run because now uh uh last week a buddy of mine who i met when i had the florist  ten years ago he called from uh miami  he's now in miami and he's now the associate of worldwide flowers and they want to have a distributorship in montreal  so i gave that to my son  which is what registered yesterday  thirty-one dollars  it's gone up a buck  and now he's in business for himself  and the beauty is he's just turned eighteen so he's entitled to about six thousand dollars in grants and he's entitled to about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in in small business loans backed by the government  at eighteen years old  uh and on my side in my consulting business has word  contacts and associations  i'm now uh launching next year into ah a full-time consultancy because of s a p a large german uh client server who's doing large applications of software into major companies  now they need a change of management methodology  so i have to create for them thirty-one courses a whole curriculum uh hire trainers uh and instruct so on and so forth  so laugh it grows  it grows  it's all part of networking  some of the reasons why you might want to start opening  your own business while naturally in the future nobody wants to hire full-time employees anymore  uh everybody's trying to hold their job  you've got downsizing  and if you can save your job in one company or move to another you have the same problems associated there  entrepreneurialship is a winning situation  it's a winning situation for a company because when they have  word employee they no longer have to pay the benefits  on the other side laugh when you get your salary you're taxed at source  so if you make fifty thousand dollars typically you may be taxed at about fifty percent so come home with twenty-five thousand thirty thousand dollars  if you make the same fifty thousand dollars in business for yourself you usually come home with about fifty thousand dollars because you're in ineligible for the tax write-offs that you aren't eligible for as an employee  so there are advantages to being in business for yourself   another thing to establish at the start is that if there are any questions i won't wait till the end to ask are any questions  as an idea comes to your mind or if we're doing something and you want clarification don't hesitate to ask a question cos oftentimes many others are thinking the same thing  and so i don't mind answering questions on an ongoing basis  so anytime something comes just uh raise your hand and i'll be happy to answer  uh another thing that is driving small business is uh technology  uh the technology changes today allow for an entrepreneur to be sitting in their basement at home with as much firepower as  word the major corporations  nobody knows how big you are in your basement  and you're two words as your comfort   your business cards your brochures your handbooks and otherwise they don't see you  and so you you're able to fax  you're able to uh email  you're able to have the same information firepower as a major corporation working out of your basement for around five thousand bucks  so it's not ah ah it's not a difficult thing to do anymore  in other words you're able to have as much resources as large corporations   again the non-full-time workforce has grown by fifty-seven percent since nineteen eighty  word going are the nine-to-five workday long time jobs predictable about three words relationships corporate culture word security blankets the  word itself  they're all being replaced with cybernetics workspace  in other words a virtual corporation which already exists  one of the companies i'm working for now is a virtual corporation  there is no building laugh   everybody communicates via email lotus notes  and they're everywhere   monday one's in philadelphia one's in brazil and they communicate via email lotus notes and so on  a few word have to have meetings together but there is no building  you don't go to work so to speak  how many of you go to work nine to five   whoa  okay well that's that's going by the wayside  time shavers as it's called people who go in at nine leave at five everyday five days a week 
Canada	 a few words they're draining on energy laugh  i ah what what you'll   notice is you'll work an eight-hour workday and come home exhausted at five o'clock where an entrepreneur will go for fourteen sixteen hours and at the end of the day well all pumped up and all ready to go for some more  uh it's all a function of doing something you love as opposed to doing something just for a paycheck   cough and if you're looking for security from the large corporations uh only sixteen of the word  hundred largest corporations at the start of the twentieth century still exist today  ah during the eighties a total of two hundred and thirty companies  disappeared from the fortune five hundred  only twenty-nine of the top a hundred companies are still in the top a hundred today  so in other words large corporations are no longer the security that they used to be in the past  as a matter of fact many of them are either breaking up or merging or you know uh uh outsourcing virtual word  their work and so they're becoming virtual corporations  uhm what i would like to do if i can no  this just just shows you the change from the uh  you know the word   eighty-five percent of the workers in the early nineteen nineties were in ag agriculture   now agriculture involves less than three percent of the workforce  word a lot of opportunities in agriculture  a student of mine uh had a uh uh his father was a farmer and farmers are really being hard hit traditional farmers wheat corn all the all the traditional crops  so this guy's really sharp and he decided he'd go into a growing niche market  he crea started growing  learning to grow chinese vegetables   a very small market but if you become the big fish in that small market uh a few words mumbled   he had he had he had his business and was so successful that actually agriculture canada called him  he was twenty-two years old at the time  they wanted him to come to ottawa to talk to all the farmers from out west and explain to him explain to them how he was successful  so i said well why are you going to go and tell them all your secrets  he said i'm not telling them all the secrets  he says a few words mumbled the trip's on them  they're going to pay my uh bedroom word   he admitted of course he uh said he would have gone to dallas looked over some land and found some land to buy because dallas being close to mexico being close to the labour for the farm the ill  the illegal immigrants who come in and  do do the farming  and he said he said to me he says uh i don't know what i should do  he said should i stay in school finish my degree or should i go and start my chinese vegetables in dallas   so i said well seeing as you don't need a degree to to  to be successful in dallas i said i'd go to dallas and a few words mumbled   last i heard he was quite successful  uhm so in the fifties the nineteen fifties seventy-three percent of employees worked in manufacturing  now less than fifteen percent do  manufacturing has gone the way of the dinosaur  and now you're looking at service industries typically information  service industries   the reason word jobs change is  word happen faster than it ever did in the past  uh change is around us  it's constant  and you have to learn now to adapt to constant change  get comfortable with this shifting platform and never really being secure solid stable for any period of time  things and conditions are changing constantly  uhm the certainty of misery is better than the misery of uncertainty   that's uh from a pogo cartoon and it shows why a lot of people are resistant to change and deny change because they are comfortable in what they've done so long that they don't wanna want to  change because it's certainty  and certainty is comforting   i was a i was a cop for six years by the way in westmount  one of my this is my fifth i'm going into my fifth career   uh i was a cop back in the sixties in westmont for six years and we noticed this phenomenon with abused women  often we'd go and we'd ask them to get out of the relationship  like we'd get the same call over and over back to the same home to the same abusive relationship we'd say come lay charges get rid of him  and you know what again the the certainty of misery is better than the misery of uncertainty and they wouldn't break away from that relation because they got trapped into this uh habit or if you will comfort zone of certainty   anyway uh the the bottom line is in order to be an entrepreneur you have to be comfortable with a roller coaster of uncertainty  and uh roller coasters are for some people are exciting and for other people they're scary  some people hate the roller coaster  other people love the roller coaster  you have to learn to love the roller coaster laugh because  in in in your own business you're not going to get that certainty of the regular paycheck the nine to five that you know exactly what's going tomorrow  tomorrow is undetermined and that's the excitement of it  that's the fun of it is nothing happens tomorrow until you make it happen  it's a little scary laugh and it puts a lot on your shoulders but it's going to be fun  and the thing is it's just a question of labelling it as exciting and fun as opposed to being fearful  uhm so let's look at who our entrepreneur like what what  ha what makes them tick  i'll show you some uh information here on uh business majors versus entrepreneurship majors versus non-business majors  in terms of conformity you can see that entrepreneurship majors have a very low level of conformity than do business majors and non-business majors  in other words they don't aren't  uh hurt by social sabotage  social sabotage is the concept that if you have a good idea for a business first thing you do is go tell your spouse your relatives your friends they'll say wow is ever that a good idea  you're all pumped up  you're ready to go   so what's the first reaction audience responds   you're nuts  don't be crazy  go and get a real job  right  so now if you if you allow that to take the wind out of your sails then you're stuck in that trap of conformity  in other words you're not doing what's normal or expected so therefore you sh you don't fit in  you have to be able to break that bond  you have to be able to go even though everybody says no it doesn't make sense  so that's where entrepreneurship majors uh have that less  or more innovative more creative  more off the wall perhaps  energy level much higher   you know i find that  you know the harsh reality isn't isn't set here  that is to say i see it the other way around laugh   in other words i don't see high energy people going in business for themselves  i see that going in business for yourself picking up your energy   uh the reverse causality if you will  in other words if you have if you go to a regular job nine to five every day it's it's  draining  it's tiring  you're exhausted  you don't know why you're word   in fact the less you do in the job the more tiring it is  if that makes any sense whatsoever  and it's even going to work and coming home  uh i see them on the commuter trains  i see them on the ar on the buses   you ever see the people  they're a herd going in in the morning and coming home at night  are they smiling  let me ask you do they look like they're going off to have a good time  no way   they're exhausted  they're b they're beat before  they've got to work   so the the the energy level is not there  and at work if your boss says would you mind doing this oh boy huh not another thing  you watch an entrepreneur in action and you'll see these people fifteen sixteen hours a day  i've had entrepreneurs into my class  now these guys have been up since seven in the morning  having had a full day come into my class eight twenty-five to ten thirty or ten fifty at night and they're on top of their game  and the students say excuse me how many hours a day do you work  and do you know what they answer  they look funny and they go i don't know cos it's not work  ah eh eh it's confucious that said if you get a job that you like you'll never have to work another day in your life   well that's what it's all about for entrepreneurs  they don't count hours  there is no such thing  there is no on and off  there is no talk about beep time to go home   it's hey there is it it their  their work runs into their life  and so they word working sixteen hours no problem  uh interpersonal effect much lower  interpersonal effect means the impact that people have on you  in other words how much you are influenced by others  and actually if you're highly influenced by others you're not going to go into business for yourself because it won't take long for someone to decide that would be crazy word go with the other way instead  risk taking higher  social adroitness higher   social adroitness is a skill of entrepreneurs called networking   the name of the game is the more people you know the more business you do  so entrepreneurs real entrepreneurs and the word  and the people who are word  they would have known half of you by now because before they would have been hanging in word saying hi nice to meet you  exchanging cards finding out who's who seeing if they can make a deal seeing if they kind find at least one or two people here who they will be able to contact next week to be able to do some business with   that's networking and that's what entrepreneurs do extremely well   uhm autonomy very high  they're very individualistic   change very high  they don't mind the concept of change  in fact they relish it  they love it   and harm avoidance low  in other words they're not they're not  motivated to avoid harm  they a few words with risk taking  and word is low  word is uh uhm uh non-profit maybe too nice  they don't they they it's finding guts  laugh   entrepreneurship is fun  it has to be fun  if you're going into business to do some  i could give you a hundred great business ideas and so tomorrow you could go out and start one of them and probably be successful  i'll show you when i show you ideas  i'll show you some great ideas   but if you don't like it if you're not going to enjoy it then why do it  if you're going to do it sixteen hours seven hours a week why do it unless it's fun   so there has to be a fun element  you have to be doing something you like   and of course the second half of that equation is profit   if it's fun without profit it's a hobby   so if you don't have that profit motivation you won't be a good entrepreneur  and that's that's what holds a lot of people back   you know you are laugh as a consumer   if you ever  when you're wearing your hat and your role is consumer when you go into a store uh you you're taught to be a good consumer  you're taught to be like a vulture  you know wait and see and if a store looks like it's going out of business wait till next week cos maybe they'll be fifty percent off  you know you're driving a hard bargain as a con  consumer as a customer   and so on the other side if you're the entrepreneur or or  or the sales person then you have to also play hardball too because otherwise you'll be ending up giving everything away
Canada	 oh it's okay you know laugh fifty percent off for you and  a few words mumbled not me  if you're too nice you'll have problems being an entrepreneur  you have to have that profit motivation  you have to everything you do is worth something    you have to have a price tag associated with it  otherwise you become too benevolent and end up laugh  going out of business   what do you think are the key skills for entrepreneurs  if you're about three words what would you say would be the key skill for an entrepreneur   the number one above all   give it a shot  mh hmm  answer   motivation sure  passion or desire  ya no definitely i mean that that's way above anything else  just the the sheer desire will carry you  in other words if you aren't driven then you might as well  comment   perserverance determination willing to stick to it over all the obstacles and hurdles  and there'll be plenty of them  that's another key trait or characteristic  in terms of skills uh like uh you know if you have a skill an ability to do something ah a learned ah  that's that's an attitude if you will  you know those those are attitudes   answer   huh  repeats   communication  networking sure  and an an extension of that is  selling  cos that's what selling is is communication  and basically that's been found to be the premier skill  for entrepreneurs  if you can't sell then you'll have to get somebody that can cos nothing happens until somebody sells something  so you can have the greatest product in the world you can have the best mousetrap you can have excellent ideas but unless somebody goes and buys them you don't have a business   so number one you need sales  and so uh many ah artisian entrepren  entrepreneurs you know artisan entrepreneurs who are very good at woodworking or some type of craft they have a problem because they make beautiful products but they can't sell em them   they don't have the skills of selling  so ah in sales you can see like uh anheuser-busch he started   in s in ah sales ah selling brooms  about four words big things   bic ah ah marcel bich of bic pens ah started his career by selling flashlights door to door  uh dr scholes uhm he was selling uh uh uh uh word  or an arch support  a few words be a salesman  heinz ketchup he had he he made  money selling his own bottled horseradish to local grocers   mary kay   and uh coleman camping equipment uh he was a travelling typewriter salesman  so it really is the communication skills uh related to uh  word   and selling is very  i mean anybody can sell  the key is credibility and trust   you all have to have ah an ah ah an  enjoyment of working with people and credibility and trust and basically then anybody can sell   since we were on that track i'm going to run you by  some things here that  you you've been feeling that one of the top  perserverance remember you were say you were saying that pererverance or determination is a key characteristic of somebody going into business for themselves   let's categorize it  would you call that a skill  a sk skill a gift is something that you can't learn  it's inher inherited   you know it's kind of like a a  proteg&eacute; or uh uhm someone who uh is is born  with a gift  you're born with a gift  a skill is something you can learn  and an attitude of course is a feeling or something internal   uhm so well you you can start back  with perserverance  how would you label perserverance audience responds   attitude   and attitude for the most part   okay   and uh there there's   what was the other one audience responds   pardon  answer   determination  okay  perserverance and determination are these interchangeable   answer   motivation okay   motivation desire passion if whatever  you want to call it you have for your business  in other words uh   answer   huh  repeats   an attitude or a passion   uhm selling the skill of selling  selling is a skill   response   yes some people have the gift of the gab laugh   phrase   question tape cuts out   so good salespeople are aware of that and so y  y y the key is you must know some people yourself who you've bought from whom you trust  when they come to you and say you know whatever they tell   you you know you believe it  ah what are some others  sure   answer   math  agrees   okay well what would that be  question   oh ya that's a definite skill   uh laugh uh you've just caught me by surprise because what most entrepreneurs do is they they would go and outsource that  like accountancy for example  you see like because of the fact it's it's   a  people are split up if they're going to do their own books  if you're going to your own accounting and and  so on and so forth  but you know what most entrepreneurs don't want to deal with finance or accounting because they want to work with their market  they're s that that in the terms of prioritizing their time to be good accountants wouldn't do them well unless they worked with their market   comment   oh do their own   mh hmm   well there's ratios and ya sure to be able to know if you're profitable or not or whether you should increase your prices or  wh what would happen if you decreased you price will you get more business and so on and so forth  ya sure for strategy  okay  uhm so uh ya sure that's definitely a skill   that's something you could you could  learn  i mean granted you may be gi you may have better mathematical knowledge than somebody else at the beginning and be more adaptable to it but nonetheless it'd be a skill  something else  answer   management in the sense that   answer   time   employees   in other words prioritize uh to be able to plan organize all of a couple words   okay  where would management come in audience response   skill for the most part  okay anybody else  some more  sure   answer   personality  okay mhh hmm  comment   uh personality would be a audience comments   it's an attitude to a certain extent  some of it is  comment   yes okay mhh hmm  some people have that natural personality   somebody else  sure  answer   being in tune with your market  okay uh  answer   knowledgeable of your market  knowledgeable of the uh other expertise in your field  type of thing  okay   comments   mhh hmm   so the so to know that you'd have to know the in the industry the business and so on and so forth  right  so that would be a audience responds   skill  sure  cos you could learn that  no matter what industry you went into you could learn uh  it over a period of time depending on how much you wanted to learn  it's as simple as that  florists   florist  when i got in to be a florist i knew nothing about florists  i word want to be a florist now   florist now   i mean now i know the traps pitfalls and everything else  i didn't realize how dependent you were as a florist on your designer   i mean i just figured you hired these people like you'd hire somebody you know off the street  your designer is your key person  most people who are florists are designers for control  i didn't know that  i didn't realize that designers were real artsy people who didn't believe in nine to five and efficiency and so on and so forth  so on the days when i'd have a lot of funerals or a lot of weddings or a lot of whatever they they they they'd   word themselves word don't feel creative today so i'm not coming in  and i'd say come in even if you're not very creative come in  no i don't feel i don't have the the  vibes i don't audience laughter   and so i'm standing there in this florist's and i'm like what do i do  i don't know how to design  you know that that's where your market  that's that's how your expertise to understand what what you need and so on and so forth   anything else   somebody else  sure  comment   team building  okay  for when you have employees  mh hmm  i'll put it over as a skill because there's definitely a  group dynamics or or the skill of being able to uh motivate people in groups and and so on  comment   uh okay  let's call it vision like visionary i e  or how do you how do you call it  how do you label that two words  seeing what everybody sees and thinking what no one has thought   that type of thing  okay creative visionary  okay  that'd be  answer   okay it's also a few words   some would argue with ya you   ah sure   ya it can be trained because in entrepreneurship one of the first things i do in every class is to get people to be sensitive to business opportunities  like an entrepreneur  uh laugh when i used to have them come in to do a class  on the way to the classroom they'd find five business opportunities with  word credit   they'd come in and say how come nobody saw that how come nobody saw this  and i just stood there going ya laugh   like every day you pass by must be a couple of dozen business opportunities   question   ah well that's that's the next phase   that would be putting the o o  opportunity into practice  then you have to do some research  then you have to determine whether or not the idea is feasible  that's when you get into the research phase  you find out if there's competition find out if there's a niche there's a you know and then make your plan business plan in terms of how you're going to attack that niche   but to see or perceive the opportunity it is a gift or a skill cos it can be developed  so the entrepreneurs that would come into class were teaching the students how to be sensitive to business opportunities   comment   yes  that's part of your research  comment   oh ya the the passion the personality and so on and so forth  sure  comment   kay okay you're  you're moving ahead to idea  in other words you're looking for scanning the  environment for opportunities to to take advantage of it  you will and then you're an entrepreneur is what you're  word   response   okay  well why is that   response   word an opportunity  response   you're okay okay   ya laugh if you're driven if you're driven by profit alone you'll never see the the   the viability to it  the thing is that for eve every   have you ever regretted ah an opportunity that you didn't take advantage of that ended up being very successful  do you s do you know what i'm saying  are you   response   okay   well dri driving around  like this i'm getting to determine the motivations of why you want to be in business for yourself and what you want to get out of it and so on  cos that there are many different types of entrepreneurs  some people are threshold entrepreneurs and want to build a great profit and others are quite happy just to make a nice living where they have a comfortable existence take care of their family that sort of thing  so but and it's not to say one's good and one's bad because it's just the opportunity they're looking for  the threshold-type opportunity is is  more elusive than just finding something that would be good for now  but what you might want to think of doing is stepping in at a level and then just to get the experience and then you'll be working up level by level  just get your feet wet a bit   you know you get an opportunity it may not be extravagant or it may not be  but don't forget if the idea is that great everybody else sees it too  o o oftentimes the big successes come from seeing something that nobody else has seen and therefore you get an edge you get a year's head-start before all of a sudden everybody realizes woo hey there's something to this   you know that's all they've got   ray kroc's idea  he he not everybody opened up the same day as him    ah you know it was years later  in fact his key employee naturally laugh   the best employee that mcdonald's ever had  won employee of the month all the time   always perfect on all his performance appraisals excellent employee comes in on his days off without pay to learn the business  what a super employee  that's the guy who started burger king audience laughs   but i mean you gotta have got to  expect that  if the idea is that good people are going to flock into it  and and even you might  get a head start if you're lucky but you better have the money to pour into that too because they'll just eat cash 
Canada	 along with my husband who did exactly the same thing i did only he doesn't have a theatre because like it was word  but  three words like really ridiculously insane  laugh   i mean it's all so ridiculous   why should   someone comments   uhm so we went we went straight up and we hiked through the uh the word  uhm went through the wonderful three or four words  laugh   what do you wanna want to do   and where do you wanna want to go  and we impressed everybody on the very first day by telling them that we wanted to go to killiniq   on the top right right smack on the tip of  ungava bay  cos we looked at the map and we thought ohh that is so cool  it's like right in the middle of nowhere  right in the middle of all this water around  and everybody roared with laughter because killiniq doesn't really exist laughs with audience   it's on the map but nobody lives there  there's no village there's nothing it's just a dot on a map so  i think we impressed everybody by wanting to go to the dot on the map laugh   so instead they sent us to nearly the smallest community that we have because yeah  and they sent us to tasiujaq which is right here on uhm uhm  on ungava bay  guess you don't   you guys should know your geography well enough to know that this is ungava bay this is hudson bay  and uh tasiujaq is the second little village uh like a hundred and twenty people   pretty small guys  really really really small laugh   uhm and we were there for one year and at the end of that year uhm word people village and it's the largest inuit village that uhm is in quebec that's well in northern quebec basically  uhm kuujjuaq is bigger over here  it's the sort of big uhm administrative centre and everything and you'll see it in the news every so often  if you ever see anything to do with northern quebec nine out of ten it's either kuujjuaq or you will have heard of great whale  two words because of the hydro project  that's where they've chosen to do the hydro project   so that's sometimes in the news as well  uh kuujjuaq is bigger than inukjuak it's got a thousand seven hundred people roughly but it's pretty much uhm it's not really divided three ways it's almost fifty-fifty white or southern southerner however  w w we call white people even if we're not white kind of in the north like   we had a jamaican teacher who thought it was the funniest thing to be called a white person all the time four or five words  be called a white man laughs with audience   he thought that was great  uh but that's how they refer to us so  audience member comments possibly a cough   uhm and there're uh quite a few white french canadians english canadians working there living there  so the school is actually not fifty-fifty but a lot of the students there english is their mother tongue  as opposed to inuktitut where word it's not the kids and three words   so that's where that's where we were and what we uh   we were both teaching  i was uh for the first year i taught grades five six seven split george taught all of secondary uhm  laugh   and he was principal for the year laugh   uhm and then when we moved over to inukjuak we were spoiled  that's why we only two or three words cos you have pretty much single level classes and i taught grade six and grade seven so  we spent uhm two years indoctrinating the word  and the women laugh thinking   cos they go from me to him  worked really well  it was really nice  uhm uhm now he's he's still up there this year teaching grade seven but i think it's his last year   little wonders in grade seven   grade seven well now you're all sort of saying starts speaking very softly grade seven that's gonna going to  be real hard two words grade seven stops speaking very softly   we do two words we need clientele and that they're all ninety point nine percent inuit children and so their mother tongue is inuktitut   and when they come to us they come to english in grade three   uhm and then they start all their content they do all their content subjects in english  they still have inuktitut uhm  i think that out here they have it everyday word   but it's slowly sort of filters down to about three times a week   and they have culture class which is usually a morning or an afternoon every week where they're that's in inuktitut   and the girls sew and the guys hunt audible breath   uhm laughs with audience   audience member asks a question   they probably wouldn't take choice  i mean they do th there's  sometimes like the girls will go out fishing and stuff and like they will do things together but they probably wouldn't also pick either option  the girls will prefer to do that  audience member starts to ask a question   audience member asks a question   no no and every year  now uhm some of the things i say are also village-peculiar  but most most villages all villages have some sort of budget to go on well not big trips like outdoor trips  and when we were in inukjuak every year we went out uhm in the spring   either with the older kids on a camping trip and the younger kids would go for a day fishing trip  so you'd go with everybody and and and and   word village they've got it's  muttering   it's great fun  that was a lot of fun  and then i went camping that's with the second group  could be seventh grade   and so yeah you can join in  you generally what happens  at one during those well the three periods of culture a week that are nice big word   the last thing you really wanna want to  do is go out of town and all week and this is   your your your kinda kind of   time that you have to do other things but  but if you wanted to join in and wanted to go down and see what they're doing that wouldn't be a problem except that they are doing  three words so uhm sometimes  like all the culture teachers are elders in the village and they speak no english so maybe they understand a bit but they  they couldn't tell you what you're doing basically  so if you've got a lower grade you have to rely on your kids to tell you what they're doing  it can be a bit difficult but  audience member comments   but yeah you know i mean we're welcome t   to join in and find out about what's going on cough in audience   so in terms of pedagogical things we we're not  really teaching we are teaching a second language but we are teaching everything in a second language   so from a pedagogical standpoint it it's  not really e s l  we always come up with an appropriate name  i call it word e s l and everybody has a different term for it  like right now the board trying to come up with a good political term to use word   uhm so that means that should  and if you apply to be hired laugh   you'll have to teach math and science and well depending on what uhm grade levels you're looking at  in primary you teach math science social studies english uhm  art noise of uncertainty you can teach  well that all depends  some people really think that's a great idea and then people freak  laugh   uh you you may in one o   if you're in a small village be asked to teach gym as well  but that's not so bad  and that's that's basically what all you teach  in secondary it breaks down to science becomes things like ecology  uhm social studies gets sort of broken down into history geography but they're lumped in together  uhm there are there is physics and chemistry but most of the time they're the board's  leaning to uh hiring specialists to do the math and physics and chemistry cos that's just specialized  i mean that was my one thing when i i   remember being here it's if i have to teach secondary math science and physics put me in primary  and that's how i ended up in grade six cos mm mm algebra   never thought about that you know laugh   it's one of those things that once i thought about it i went mm mm i won't do that  but some people are comfortable with it and then you'd probably go to a smaller village where they don't have a specialist  but most villages are are  gettin getting a math science specialist who gets to teach math and science noise from audience   uhm and and and in senga  those people are often not e s l specialists so they often have more difficulty that you can in adapting to uh   like it's easier for us to pick up i find it's easier for tesl people to pick up a book on on  uh ecology and and or biology or something like that and read it and figure out what it is we have to do and know how to teach a lesson on it than it is for a biology person to think that oh my god how is someone who doesn't speak my language  gonna going to learn this  they don't have the the ingrained drummed into your head techniques that we all have  and so often the tesl specialists are in quite a few words a lot of content people who'll be asked to be your assistants   does happen  uhm when things break down i i i  thought oh i'll have quite a few words little teeny piece of chalk here  okay  i sat there everyday and i never even looked at this myself  in the primary sector we have   oh don't worry you'll never get this laugh so  i'll just i'll say it out loud  uhm in we have four hundred and sixty-five students in inuktitut so that's basically grade five to grade three grade two  we have this is a new word this is a sudden change five hundred and sixty-eight students study french and we have  four hundred and fifty students studying english  that's the first time to my knowledge to my knowledge that that balance shifted  normally it's either fif it has been  fifty fifty or more on the english side so  hmm laugh i wonder what that means  and in secondary we just have english and french no more inuktitut  well they're still learning inuktitut like they have inuktitut   class language class every week uhm or couple times a week  that's this is more like uhm  seventy-eight  and for kindergarten this is a funny one cos there's one village kuujjuaq and kuujjuaq likes to be different uhm that has a sort of experiment going on   and they start  where are my numbers  where did they go  oh there they are  start from there  they start uhm french loud feedback type noise on tape  in kindergarten  and it's the only village and they have all the cree students  laugh   so two hundred and sixteen little lovely ones in uhm kindergarten  so y i don't know if you're getting a vision of how many little kids there are running around this place but there are a few of them  so all in all there are two hundred two thousand five hundred and seventy students in the north from a population of seven thousand people  that's about forty percent of the population  inukjuak my old village uh one of the years that we were there there was a statscan statistics canada thing that came out  and and it it had the highest birth rate per capita in canada laugh   there were almost more babies than there were adults at one point  laugh   there was a baby born every week that whole year  uhm and if not more than one  there's at least one child born a week laugh   whistle in audience   three words baby showers  laugh   uhm so and you can tell they're like three words  keeps coming up in the system  and in inukjuak over the few years that i was there we started off in my first year we had forty kids going into kindergarten   by the time i left there were three kindergartens of of uhm four kindergartens of twenty kids each   so laugh there laugh potential for jobs   comin coming up in the near future   but it also it's a very uhm big social problem that's gonna going to be happening because all of these kids are going to get older and older and they're   gonna going to hit secondary and then they're  gonna going to graduate or whatever and what are they   gonna going to do   there's this big population boom that's coming up  you know but these two thousand uhm five hundred odd students what are they gonna going to do  there aren't very many jobs you know  audience member asks a question   very few come south  it's still   it's still not   well in the bigger communities it is a priority they want their students to come down to cegep 
Canada	 their children come down  and smaller communities they're still not actively encouraged to come  and in some places they're still kind of discouraged to leave  cos they don't want them to leave  cos the theory is that if they go they won't come back or if they do come back they're not going to be word   it depends on how they come back  if they come back after a year depressed and demoralized cos they couldn't stand it   which is highly likely  you're coming from a village of a hundred and twenty people and you come to this laugh you know like  this is a big shock  uhm then then they come back to the village and th and they don't know what to do with themselves  they don't know how to fit in cos they know that they don't fit  there's nothing for them to do anyway and and and  they've gone to the south and they've failed or it hasn't gone overly well so what do they do  or if they come back here and they do well they get jobs down here  you know especially if it's in something that isn't uhh a direct service  like if they you know they if someone  goes and studies art history there's not a whole lot of museums to go get a job as a curator at laugh anyway  so whaddya what do you do  you know like you can go work there's a uhm  uhm a cultural institute there  we have  someone comments   laugh but it's a museum and there have been archaeological digs in the north and they found uhm uhh a lot of very interesting artifacts  and that is something that is coming up and it would be nice to have inuit doing those excavations as opposed to southern archaeologists coming up   certainly they'll have more uh more  involvement in it but other than that i mean how if you go into archaeology and you're inuit will you  the likelihood of you working in the north is pretty slim so  you know you could become a lawyer or a doctor or something that's something that could be useful to your community in three words  but there are very very few  it hasn't there haven't been that many graduates from university yet  it's just starting  the schoolboard is only uhm  i dunno don't know   seventeen   seventeen years old  yeah no couldn't be  eighteen now eighteen years old  and before that there were day schools federal day schools  and in but in most cases they were sent to residential schools  now it doesn't  everybody kind of cringes whenever we say that too cos it's oh my god residential schools  they've just seen all those c b c movies  uhm for the most part i haven't heard any horror stories of things  it doesn't seem that they had the same problems that a lot of the indian children seem to have had at residential schools  that's not to say it didn't happen  i'm sure there are cases of of of abuse and things that happened   but per se like the people i've talked to who're the  roughly people my age people in their thirties and forties they went to residential school and very few of them have bad experiences apart from feeling lonely and and very far away from home and losing a lot of the cultural contact like all those  the traditional things that would have been taught to them as young people in the community  they lost that  they weren't there when that happened uhm so  so they they come back to the communities and they integrate in their own ways and there's cer  there is a certain displacement of knowledge at a certain level  th th there's a lot of things the elders know that nobody else knows anymore because they weren't around   and it's not necessarily two words these guys  laugh   the two thousand laugh because a culture class can only do so much  and unfortunately uhm it's not always uhh organized as it could be  and it's often communities don't have there won't be anyone to teach for instance boys culture  hunters are hunting and there's no one who's gonna  going to come in and teach so uhm  th th they want to keep up the traditions on one hand but on the other hand it's really hard to find people who are are willing to come and work in the school and do that uhm  so the people you get are usually very good if they do but they don't often stay very long  that's another thing is they're not they don't they don't have they don't have our i don't know protestant work ethic is the only term i can think of laugh   their their lives up until forty years ago were lives of survival  they weren't living in houses they weren't working they were surviving  they were hunting and fishing and and  moving around wherever the hunting was good  and they were completely nomadic  there's uhm one of my friends in inukjuak she's i guess now she must be over forty-two but at the time i remember she had just turned forty and she she was the last person in the village that was born out on the land uhm so  but i mean to me it was fascinating that there was someone still around that was born on the land you know that's a weird concept to me to born out   and when they mean on the land they mean literally whoops here's some moss this looks like a good spot laughs with audience you know  this was on the land  and they two words i think it was winter i can't remember wh how two or three words   so they still have people who have very interesting memories of living  a lot of them still remember a time before houses the time before central heating the time before running water the time before stores  and and and uh and becoming used to convenience foods  two words chuckwagon  it's this disgusting sandwich thing that you stick it in the microwave to heat up  if you ask your students what did you have for lunch ninety percent of them will say chuckwagon  took me a long time to find out what chuckwagon sob  sniff   wasn't anything i ever  you know you kind of expect peanut butter sandwich or something  no chuckwagon   if anything  uhm and still a lot of their their what is it uhm living or their word   the children are allowed to do what uhh as they please pretty much  if they want to stay up till three in the morning on a school night they do  and it's not that they're not looked after really it's just that they're treated in a different way and it's up to the child to go to bed when he's tired and eat when he's hungry kind of thing  so that there may not even be formal meal times  which when you start implementing a regimented school system where they have to be there at nine o'clock in the morning and they can't they're not supposed to sleep in and they should've had breakfast before they came and all these things that we'd expect from them   expect them to be relatively rested and fed so that they can concentrate   it's not really fair  and it's it's one of those things that  y you can't really go in and say well this is what we demand   word   but then you kinda kind of have to try to explain that well if they did that then they would do better in school  so it's a it's a draw   and and th  there're a lot of parents now that that   are have gone through enough of the school system to know what is ex what we expect what we have  our preconceived notions of what school should be when we go out there  so there's a difference between older parents and younger parents  there is  sometimes it's not uhm necessarily a favourable difference  like theoretically you can think that oh well a parent who's gone through either the federal system or the residential school well they know what school's about so they should be more sympathetic or more   you know where it is laugh   more uhh uhm able to help their child  six or seven words aside i'll just stick it there for now uhm  but that's not always the case sometimes sometimes  they have had bad experiences and they tend to think that their idea of school is is not a good one uhm   but sometimes the older parents uh they  they understand that there is a value to school they don't understand how the system works necessarily they don't necessarily  they're not really able to help in any way but  no most certainly the likelihood of any parent being able to help with homework is very very very unlikely that you'll find parents  that that can do that  or or are willing to do that cos they don't necessarily know that it's something that would be good to do  aside, talking about something in the room let's just throw that on the floor audience laughs   uhm uhh and a lot of the time you'll find that  you have children have very old parents  report card day comes and the parents come and meet you  and and you think is this that woman's child  laugh   it's just not biologically possible  uhm adoption is a very different thing in the north  for one y if if it's between northern families they don't go through the whole legal nightmare that everyone seems to have to go through down here  they often will adopt uhm like i if  if a girl gets pregnant   a teenage girl gets pregnant   it's not considered a problem  it's not considered something bad or something stigmatic  there's nothing stigmatic about it  if she decides to keep the baby that's fine  if she decides it really she doesn't  feel she wants to be bothered about it the mother will adopt it  or or the grandmother might or another family in the village  i it usually keeps within family the the child will stay in the family but sometimes the they'll be adopted to another family or  so that's where you get these women or mo mm these parents who are definitely grandparent age you know laugh if not great-grandparent age who have these like really young children  so it's kind of an interesting thing  it certainly makes for interesting translation of report card  it definitely two or three words and try and explain what social studies are laugh   it's very exciting laugh   report cards are a lot of fun  in the smaller communities you go around to the houses and you visit and that's just great that's uhh  you really get to know people  even in the big communities  com kuujjuaq is a little different but in inukjuak where i w i can honestly say i don't know everybody in the village and i've lived there three years  you still get to know families of your chi of your children and you know  sometimes you don't wanna want to know what the household situation is like sometimes it's not a good situation but you're aware of it and so you can react accordingly  you know that there's something been going on the family or that the parents drink or whatever so you know that the reason little bobby is going berserk on you is   there are reasons  it's not just cos he's being a pain in the butt today  audience member asks a question   it's a difficult thing  uhm a lot of the time we're we're  viewed as people who are coming to give them a service to do something and they really appreciate that we're coming to do that but getting involved in their personal problems is something else   if well obviously if you think a child is being abused you can't just sit back and not do something about it  i mean as a teacher as as a professional you cannot just yeah  s uh s as a human being but also as a teacher you have a legal obligation to  to try and do something  so you have to go through the sort of proper channels of the principal and  in every school there's a principal and uh what's called a centre director who is uhm always an inuit person uh word uhm  they are like the li a liaison  with the community  they're an administrator within the school but their primary function is to make sure everything runs smoothly with the community so the community understands what's going on  so they would be like really the most appropriate person to see and you would approach them and talk to them about the situation  and they will also know more  they will more likely know more about the situation than you do anyway so they will know the family they will know of anything that has been done in the past 
Canada	" this is when the people crack  because when you're going through that identity crisis the students are right there to help you audience laugh   they're there every step of the way you know  for example like i've noticed this with first year teachers a lot uh i i dunno don't know  maybe you'll notice this when you start or uh maybe donovan  you've seen this a lot i dunno don't know  but they when you see them start teaching   they they they they dress well and  and a tie maybe   they look good de dah duh duh and they have the book and the  teaching and duh de duh de duh  and after a month you know you see them start coming with their jeans and and their t-shirt you know  and and then they start you know trying to act cool more and stuff like that  and then you start they start turning into teenagers you know audience laughs   word a lot  and and and it's really funny  and then and then all of a sudden they don't sleep very well any more and they start having problems  and because they're with the students all the time  so who you're gonna going to have the most interaction with are students you know  and students start by asking ah how's it going you know how are you doing  you look tired you know  what's going on word   oh we don't need to work today eh  no let's let's just talk about it a bit  you know and you know  and it it happens a lot  it happens a lot where where  the students the teachers become students again   you know they don't they're th they fall  back into to being a   a student and and that's when the trouble starts you know   i think that's when the trouble starts  so you have to you have to keep in mind that who you are you  you're no longer a student you're now a teacher   and i think that's that's my main thing  about ah about the identity crisis  and the reason why you have the identity crisis is be  tape side ends   question and answer session with audience at the start of the talk  okay uh first i uh i thought i'd talk about my my experience and how i got the job and et cetera  so uhm last year i was doing a final course at this time i had one course left  and at the same time i was working at a lot of  these little uhm private language schools  you know like word college and i worked at  one word on site and stuff like that  i was also doing the monitor program component  are you word familiar with this   audience member answers   has everybody done it done that   audience member answers   audience member answers   word   yeah it's like one of the first things they ask you on the c v so  some audience mumble   it's very very impressive  on your c v don't i put i didn't put  monitor i put teaching assistant   uh you know  and that's what i think you are so  aright alright so i was working   at the same at the same time that i was doing my degree and somewhere around this time february march i sent out i think seventy or eighty c vs to different school boards and just about every cegep kay okay   out of that i didn't get a call until august  fifteenth i think around august fifteenth  so the whole summer passed before i got a call  and then i got two job interviews   one in laval at uh pont-cartier and the other one was in saint-fran&ccedille;ois which is much farther   uhm and eventually i got the job at pont-cartier  which was a replacement   most of you if you think you're going to work in the cegeps  don't expect to get a uh a position   you'll probably get a replacement okay   which is unfortunate but always take it  uhm so i worked at pont-cartier for one session  and then at the end of that session i </- > i  uh got another job at rene-belanger in la   laval and that's where i am now okay  uh so that's basically what was going on uh or has been going on for the past year  ah getting into the cegeps is uh not exactly easy  out of the seventy c vs that i sent out i got uhm one two three four five six   i got five cegep interviews and one school board interview   outa out of seventy c vs  and most of my friends weren't three or four words  very impressed because they did not get any uh interviews at all  so if you get one or two you're really doing well okay  don't don't don't expect to send out seventy and get fifteen or word   you see most of the time you don't even get replies  th they don't even acknowledge you  or they send back information and tell you to send them more information which is a big pain and i never ended up doing that  but you probably should okay audience laughs   but i never did it because it's it's   a lot of running around   okay uhm   my personal experience i have uh two bachelor's degrees one in english literature and one in the tesl pronounced "" tessil""   and uh i have all the experience that i just talked about   and uhm one of the uh one of the important things when the cegeps decide on who they're  gonna going to choose when they're selecting the candidates this is really important   the first  anybody doing a master's   you are   answers   mm mm you will   okay   answers   okay  are you starting it   have you started it  answers   okay  good luck  replies   uh most of the cegeps aren't   the first thing they don't w they look at  is not your degree   k okay that's the first thing  so don't do master's thinking oh hey do the master's and i'm  gonna going to get into a cegep  it doesn't work like that  for the english for teaching english as a second language in a cegep the first thing that they're going to look at is your experience  okay i i don't have a  bach bachelor's a master's   degree  i got the jobs based on my experience or i got the interviews based on my experience   uhm clears throat i know there's it's uh  there's a a misconception  that the master's will get you the interview and that's not true  the experience is i i think th   the experience is much more important   mkay okay   uhm and that's and the experience   can be almost anything   it doesn't matter where or what you do  if it's volunteer or anything put it on your c v  i had a two-page c v and when i was writing it i started to laugh because most of it's b s but i worked at those places and i put them down   and in the end they ask you about almost every one  audience member agrees   i worked at uhm  i volunteered at a community centre i put it down  i worked at concordia i did that monitor thing which is  such a   inaudible interruption from audience member     pardon me  apologizes for cutting in     ah okay three or four words   uh the the th sh the  monitor program is is uhm i don't think it's   uh th the greatest experience in the world   word   audience member comments   repeats and elaborates on comment   it might be  it might seem like a waste and i agree sometimes it's very badly run  sometimes you just end up giving out exams  audience member comments   it depends on the teacher yeah   audience member comments   but yeah but you don't put like i invigilated exams in your c v you put you were a teaching assistant  word it's really what you are   and uhm the the cegeps are just immensely impressed with it  and they don't know what the monitor program is so i didn't tell them audience laughter   sentence   uhm they asked what my uh my uh  experience was in the monitor program and i told them the truth you know  sometimes i invigilated sometimes i corrected and sometimes i taught   you know  but just the fact that you were a teaching assistant at concordia  it makes it it it's a big deal   and i'm sure that that's one of the big bonuses that i had on my c v uh compared to other people  so if you did do it don't don't be shy  put it on your c v  uhm so where am i  so yeah the first thing they look for is experience  the second thing i think is probably the degree  yemkay okay   the degree does not have to be a tesl degree surprisingly enough  many cegeps hire people without tesl degrees very very common  ah which goes back to my first point about experience being  more important  ah the people who get the degrees they might have a degree in  math or i dunno don't know fine arts  but they've taught overseas or they've taught somewhere and they get the interview and end up getting the job based on that experience   okay ah in terms of the degree the bachelor's degree is  uhhhh is i mean you can't go any lower than that  you can't go like teach with cegep degree  in terms of the master's there's this big controversy whether you should have the master's or not have the master's okay  unfortunately you're on uhm you're on the down the huge chunk word apparently an aside; followed by audience laughter   you're on the uh   if you look at uh i think nineteen ninety-three the reforms  came in   audience member responds   is that correct  audience member responds   two words were announced okay  audience member responds   so nineteen ninety ninety-six  so somewhere around nineteen ninety-three nineteen ninety-four  the reforms started to take place in the cegeps  and basically the hiring curve if you look it went kind of like this you know  uhm so around nineteen ninety-five  audience member comments   around nineteen ninety-five uh people were getting jobs like crazy  um now i graduated at the end of nineteen ninety-five so uh actually it's  push this curve over i'm not very good a math person  push this curve over a little bit cos uh word  in nineteen ninety-five there was more of them   but uh nineteen ninety-four ninety-five we were at a peak  and they were just creating job positions they had so many students it was crazy okay  unfortunately now we're up around here and there's no more positions being created or very very few okay  uh the cegeps that are creating positions at this point in time  are the cegeps that are completely unorganized some audience members laugh   so there's a catch twenty-two  you might get a position but it's gonna  going to be with a pretty unorganized cegep audience members laugh   ah so right now this positions  aren't being created  so uh there are some cegeps where you might be lucky enough to pick something up and get uh it's much more one or two words now  so the question is whether you need the master's or not   uhm and that's that's the big debate   because now they can be  here they couldn't be picky they could take anybody  three or four words   here they have to be a lot more picky  and uh i think masters' will start to grow in importance   not saying that you need one uh necessarily but it will grow in importance  so if you're thinking of doing one before getting a job uh think carefully about it you know  i'll go on to talk about the importance of masters' word  master's or anything at the end   uhm okay   and uh finally ah getting after once   you've looked at uh your experience and your degree okay uhm   the and analyzing your c v you'll finally  hopefully get the interview  the c v by the way i sent uh i sent  bilingual c vs  don't send english c vs only   in fact if you can avoid sending english c vs if you can send them in french it's really advisable okay  ah i know it sounds funny for an english teacher but the people who look at your c vs first are not anglophones term for english speaking canadians   they're the people in human resources okay  but i would send ah i sent bilingual cover letters and french and a french uh c v the the  rest of the c v was in french but the uh the  cover letter was bilingual  which is a good idea because a lot of cegeps especially if you write well uhm  now i don't i'm not a very good writer so i had someone else do my c v for me audience laughs   so it was a big trick  but uhm they do read the cover letter of the c v and check for grammar mistakes and check for ah style and everything else   which is you know something we don't think about but the university departments often do word cegeps don't  audience member agrees   so inaudible exchange between an audience member and speaker a, five seconds   laugh okay  so finally uhm if you're lucky enough you get a   a job interview   uhm   what can you expect in the interview  oh jeez the interviews are hell okay  you're gonna going to hate them  several audience members react   there's nothing to look forward to  they're hell  they're hard they're full of w a  lotta lot of lotta lot of  pressure uhm and they're not enjoyable at all   uhm draws in audible breath so okay  ah i put the interview as being uh the third thing that  you you get and it it's so important the interview about getting the job   the to getting the interview the experience and the degree counts  once you get the get into the interview  all that is forgotten okay  you could you could have zero experience and your your bachelor's degree you   coulda could have got a a  two point zero g p a four point zero is highest grade point average  you know   everything once you get into the interview is forgotten okay  they don't care about your experience they don't tar  care about your degree "
Canada	 if there was a problem before and if anything had been done  and there are there is social services you know th   but you could not approach them yourself that would have to go through the school  and through nursing possibly i mean if it's really bad nursing knows as well  there's there's a nursing station in every community two or three words   they're great i'll never have such great word  service again laugh   uhm but sometimes things do happen that're are   upsetting because you do become involved in these uh communities and you know the children and you know the parents and you know what's going on and uhm  it has an upside in that you you can become really involved if you've got a child who's got a learning disability or something  the parents can be very word it's not hard to find them and it's not hard to contact them and they're usually very very  interested in trying to find a way to help their child  obviously uhm  and so in that way it can be really rewarding when you've got a situation where you're really working with the parents to help this child and you can do that  it's not just you know you have a hundred and twenty students you're an e s l specialist and oh that's that kid third row in the back you know  you know where their parents are living come from what they do after school  you know these word you see them they see you after school and you know exactly what's happening  so sniff on one hand it's a lot of fun and and it  you can really get in personal contact with the community but on the other hand it can be if there's if something   bad happens it can go very wrong  and i mean there was a stats uhh another  thing that came out in the newspaper fairly recently i think just after christmas on the the suicide rate in the north  it's it's the highest among teens it's the highest  in canada  and now in the three years i was there i was lucky in that there was only one suicide in one of the communities i was in and it was a   three or four words student  loud cough in audience   uhm but i mean when something like that happens it's just  really really really really horrendous  there's nothing   you're just totally numb through the core and and    i mean that's to say it knocks the whole community out of the water as well and sniff   there's nothing to say that that will happen but it's   it is a possibility  it does happen  and when you're in a small community it's just the shock is is just horrendous  especially if it's one of your students about 8 seconds of quiet muttering and loud noises   it's just a horrible thing  but it's someth it's a reality  that four words   what do we do  where do they go  there's only so much that they can do word   school is one of the only things that they have to do and lord knows laugh that's not always a lot of fun to them  motivation in secondary is three words  laugh   university topic  audience member starts to comment   audience member asks a question   fairly seldom   uhm very seldom actually  usually teachers will stay in one place for for  a length of time   uhm sometimes it depends like two of my friends who came up when we were teaching in kuujjuaq they came up on materni t   to cover for a maternity leave  well when that person came back that job wasn't there anymore  so they went to another community that needed a teacher  happened to need a teacher at christmas right at the same time that the other teacher was coming back  so th they moved really quickly and then later on went back so   so things can happen and you can reque  request a transfer if you want to  if you feel you want to try out  if you're in a big place and you might not word  working in a small place or vice versa  if you get there  but it doesn't happen all that often  there's some teachers just wanna want to  teach in a school three words   and it gets easily fifteen if not seventeen years  easily that long  and she's been in a number of communities because after three or four years in the same community you kinda kind of  feel like you want a change  but she still wants to stay at the word so she's gonna going to hafta have to four words   but i think she's the only person i know that has laugh   the word can travel to most places but   you will get to travel   you get to travel but   every two years we have word days in kuujuak and everybody and his dog not quite uhm come to kuujuaq and we have five panicked could be panic days of of   of workshops and stuff  and everybody all gets together so  if you have the laugh starts two or three words  do the whole coast laugh ends all the way around which is well it's twelve villages by the time you get up  laugh starts word you'll be glad to see the ground again laugh ends but that way you get to see the other villages  at least from there  sometimes the things that happen   audience member asks a question   yeah i think it probly probably is harder cos i went up with marcus so for me it wasn   i didn't have that problem   uhm   mind you i was the person that everybody said like all of our friends thought starts imitating someone else's voice five words you're such a city girl ends voice imitation   i mean we're going to the village of a hundred and twenty people right  i've never lived anywhere smaller than montreal right   you know laughs with audience   so it really was kinda kind of predicted that i would find this really tough right but who wouldn't  you see your first year  i have a photo somewhere here that i i i guess i  bring this  i didn't bring all of our photo albums just because  th you wouldn't believe me  but i'll pass it around sniff   this is crossing the s   this blue building over here is the school and i'm about to walk out my front steps   and this is coming home for the weekend  i'll pass those around  those aren't presents from home i'm carrying guys these are called books laugh   so mmm  specially especially in primary my god  i don't remember too many weekends i wasn't working or preparing things  but in a way i mean it sounds grim but in a way it's fun too  because you have the s you can have   your own class you can do whatever you want  i mean there are programs there are things that  that you have to follow but nine out of ten you need to supplement in a big way  and also it's your place to to to put whatever you want on the walls  to to come in in primary   word   audience member comments   exactly yeah  you never know where you're gonna going to   be and so you kinda kind of get gung-ho too  and also until you've figured out which way is up which i wrote off the first year i figure  but at least the firs you know at least till christmas you're really not  aah it's word like what's goin   going on and how to cope and laugh   you're really really busy uhm   so you really y   well you have a lot of free time technically because you don't have you aren't taking buses anywhere you don't have to commute  there's no transit time here  you're still  i don't know a fir first year teacher that didn't just say oh my god laugh i never realized how much work it would be  audience member asks a question   judging by the length of my hair which probably october  laugh   and the fact th th that there's  a bit of snow but not much snow  yeah i'm still word   audience member comments   audience member asks a question   the school's are very well supplied  audience member comments   but in saying that you know they're very well supplied with basic things  and if you have a great desire to do art projects with  with you know papier m&acircumflex;ch&eacute; well no you could probably even find papier m&acircumflex;ch&eacute; stuff  uhm generally they're very well supplied  they're they're usually you'll have your own projector in class  audience memeber comments   and it's really uhm uhm  it won't be there you'll have to go get it from the a v room  audio-visual room at the beginning of the year  but you'll have like you know a tape recorder with as many headphones as you need  uhm paper pencils are all supplied to the students so there's lots of that  and otherwise you just arrive on time and have two or three words pencils  word laugh   but thr and there are materials  i j i js i i didn't know   what to bring so i just sort of threw a whole bunch of stuff in my bag but  i didn't really bring  audience member comments   i brought a fruit word for the polar bear  and i got a unit on one of the ecology secondary one units that you guys can come look at  this one just blows me right out of the water  this is my idea of pure hell  teaching logic and set theory in secondary format laughs with audience   and it's a really goo   this this program came out last year  our my my two words  in in secondary math wrote this unit  and i think it's wonderful bec   as as a language teacher it's wonderful  the first thing the first chapter chapter one sentences  and everything is equating math with sentences like uh  uh and and stories and  and the problems are you have a sentence and you have to translate it into a math kind of thing like uhh determine the truth   of of these things  oh uhh well i'll let you look at it later because  laugh can't start in the middle and laugh   quiet muttering and i don't really know what i'm saying either so end quiet muttering   but it's it's a wonderful wonderful thing  so you  there are things out there i mean there are we have for seventeen years been working our little tail feathers off trying to create materials  aside this is grade five math book end aside   uhm but and word produces  we have our own printing facilities and we produce all of these things oureslves so they're you know they're not really all that expensive   uhm and we have some really i i brought some  of the inuktitut books cos i really like them  i have no idea start laugh what this book is about guys  end laugh so don't ask me what it's about but it's really pretty  laughs with audience   and it's in syllabics  i thought it was really nice  word about stories  now this i can just guess it's about this little girl you know  and it's and these are things that we produced ourselves so  at the board   so so there are things there but just sometimes they're not as much as you need  or when you get to your class and  like my first year i had grade five six seven split  i had one kid who was grade five three three two  two grade sixes and ten grade sevens  i think that's how it worked  yeah because like thirteen and then seven eight nine great  but i discovered very quickly those grade sevens could  couldn't even do the grade six math book  so i had to suddenly launch them back into grade five math  which was a bit of a trauma for them of course but  not not not as much of a trauma as it was for me to realize that aaahh they're not at the level they're  sposed supposed to be  what am i sposed supposed to do here  so you c i couldn't follow absolutely everything that was in the grade five math book cos i didn't want them to feel like babies  and so i was makin making math sheets  audience member comments   word machines  you know tesl people are the only people i've found in the north that know how to work a word machine  cos most of their programs don't seem to even entertain the thought that you might find one anywhere  we still have those in the north and they work wonderfully  just covered in purple ink and yeah yeah  so i made a hundred and a thousand and   one math sheets  i can't think of  the math sheets i have been making for so long i don't ever   wanna want to see them again  so this is it  you've got stuff there you've got the bones generally but   and especially if it's something you don't know a lot about like  you know science class was not my idea of a grand time  cos a lot of the time i just couldn't figure out what it was they were aiming us at  and there're a lotta lot of tho  everything's very hands on uhm specially the math program  the math program has  there's a room in every school a small room in every school for the math supplies 
Canada	 that's all uh mcdonald's' uhm secretary uh ray kroc's secretary in the times of high growth he would come and he wouldn't be able to pay her weekly salary because he  the business was just eating the money  and he'd word her and say i'm sorry i can't pay you this week do you mind if you take shares instead and  four or five words at the plant   and now she's a multi-millionaire as as a result of what she was getting a couple hundred dollars a week in shares which is now worth many millions of dollars  so that in a large opportunity  that's that's the things you're faced with is   is the need for cash  like the steven jobs word in the wrong business because the need for money just dilutes your ownership your control  question   sure   then you'll have a decision to make because the choice then becomes do you want to get big with the business because  there's a there's a there's a penalty  statement   you don't have any longer some control   you're no longer in charge now there's a board of directors  there's a lot of shareholders and you may have only ten percent of the business  that ten percent may be worth multi-millions of dollars but in essence in a shareholders' meeting you can't say here's what we're  gonna going to do next   comment   many of them yes they they  recycle as they call it   and so what you have is a typical ah you know business cycle  where you have from development through to growth through the maturity and decline what you'll have is if the business really starts to accelerate the entrepreneur will get off here and then come back and start a new  business and just go through the cycle over and over again  because they love the control  comment   they don't want to have it so that it becomes a big  cos once you get up in here you're talking big business  bureaucracy numerous procedures and so on and so forth  so some don't like that  and if they don't they just recycle  they make their money here   they sell the business here  and there'll be a lot of people making the offers  you bring the business  i have one word friend of mine who's excellent  at the as he calls it two million dollar companies  he says i can take a company from zero to two million dollars  after that he says i don't know what to do   he says others come in and they're good from two million to eight million   and then you have the experts from eight million and so on  but he says he's good up till two million dollars and at two million dollars he sells the company starts another one and then the people from the two million to eight million category come in and buy it off him   better he says that way he says they come in you know they put systems in place and deals and policies and so on  but not him he says i don't want to have nothing to do with that  so but this this is why in any business you've got to make decisions at each stage  and some people they just refuse to grow and just plateau   oh man i'm thinking of a few words   anybody heard of three words   a few people eh laugh   they're a hole in the wall right  humbugs laugh   ya humbug laugh   if you go through their operation you would feel/->  feel sorry for these people  the store looks like it's falling down  uh they they don't do any advertising  they sell these things internationally  and you barb my wife knows   the uh the family and she says you should see their country place and their their their huge wealth  they're humbugs  it's all run by fam the family  and they don't want anybody else in  and i said being uh the entrepreneur laugh i said you should franchise this thing you could do this you could do this and they said we don't wanna want to laugh   we're quite happy right where we are  we can take control family-owned and nobody else is involved  and we're doing quite nicely thank you very much  so you know there's an opp  the the the opportunity is there to grow and they said no we're just gonna going to stay here  that's the beauty of being in business for yourself  you decide  there's not a board of directors that comes and tells you what you have to do   so with this given this uh  how many here are entrepreneurs   alright no i like that  i like  you're you're you're word  it  you know what you're word on the other hand  see i ask you about the conformity problems that you had   a few words glasses eh  i'll ask the question  i'll say like is this li is this is it  i'll say is this green or blue  how many will say green and i'm telling you the minute  word put up their hands everybody will be two or three words before they put up their hand laugh   that's conformity  that's that's being afraid of being judged by others  if you go in business for yourself you have to avoid that  you have to just say yup or nope or decide for yourself  if everybody else looks and says boy are you ever a nut say i guess so laugh   you have to be able to shake it off uh because if you listen too much to what other people are saying or or judging you by then uh you're gonna going to have problems making it in business  based on this can anyone be an entrepreneur   yes because in essence i i i   some of them have a certain amount of a gift obviously  you might have an advantage because you're born with the gift of the gab but if you aren't born with the gift of the gab you can acquire  it or hire it laugh   you know if you're not a good sales person take a partner who is  complimentary skills  if you're good at finance never go in business with a friend   never go in business with a friend on that basis alone  if the friend has complimentary skills sure but i mean if both of you are great at marketing then one of you isn't needed   question   mhh hmm  question continues   absolutely   ya sure   question   okay well in other words if for example you wanted to go into a music career you were saying and and   you don't have you don't have the  ability to sing or play an instrument   interjection   clarifies question   okay  makes a point   oh you could be  sure yes   in that much the same way as you see in flea markets many people with a lot of skills or crafts  they're very good with woodwork or whatever and they   they have that gift let's say that that   they develop and use and they they sell it  they they word for market   question   yes  question continues   oh i see   ya sure   question continues   yes you're a consultant dentist doctor these are entrepreneurs who are limited by a twenty-four hour clock  in other words you're always you're  limited by how many hours there are in a day unless you can clone yourself  makes a point   uh no that's right   cos in a lot of uh it may be more of a factor when you're buying a business  when people go to buy a business you have to be careful because a lot of times the whole of the business is based on the personality of the owner  and so in other words all kinds of customers coming into the store and everything is going gangbusters the person better watch it that this guy didn't like get all his friends and relatives to come in and a few words   a few words that didn't happen  even so when you buy the business all of a sudden nobody comes anymore because old joe whoever owned the business before he knew everybody by their first name they knew him and so a few word know you   so you can lose business on that  and you're right if you have a skill or a gift and you are in business then you have to find a way to duplicate yourself in some way shape or form train others teach others develop a standardized system  automate whatever so that you eliminate your de de  dependancy of the business on you question and answer exchange between speaker a and multiple extra-corpus speakers, 30 sec.  the other ones that are excellent at that in a local vein is ben and jerry's  ben and jerry's is a super family for getting publicity getting their name in the paper with no charge   you know  the the identity you notice that  two word you notice in hollywood they're always doing some weird thing or or another to always get their names in the paper and so ben and jerry's is super at that cos it costs them zero  so when ben and jerry's was growing and they got to this stage here and they started to lose money because ben and jerry were still running it and the business had gotten beyond entrepreneurial management  you know what they did  they ad they advertised for a c e o chi uh chief executive officer bring in professional management do you know how they did it audience response   they had an word   they had laugh wild two word ben and jerry  ben is as crazy as a bed bug  he's saying he'd go to a you you  go to a professional executive placement agency and you hire a c e o that's you know goes through the assessments and the tests and all the rest of it  they went on this weird route let let  me tell you  every paper across north america carried these looney toons  and you know what they ended up hiring a c e o who had the credentials but in the meantime they got tonnes of publicity for free  that's that's the beauty   that's marketing  that's that's a marketing genius   okay let's move it on  if we can be comfortable with the idea that anybody can be an entrepreneur it's just a question of having the passion having the desire having the vision and not allowing anybody else to knock you off the track  and not allowing yourself to knock yourself off the track  you can be your own worst enemy  you can beat yourself worse than anybody else now  you can you can rip yourself worse than any of your enemies  you know behaving yourself saying i will not do any  about three words dah dah dah dah dah dah and now  you gotta have got to learn how to motivate yourself be your best friend because when you get into entrepreneurship you've got nobody there holding your hand saying that's okay you'll be alright   there's no training program for entrepreneurs   you're never going to go into into a situation and learn to be an entrepreneur  nobody's going to teach you because then you're the competitor  i've worked for three entrepreneurs in my life   all of them very well off  none of them had money   interesting  no entrepreneur and i'm talking multi-millionaires none of them had money  they're be bumming coffees off me and cigarettes because all their money was tied up back in the business back in the business  they had no cash  these people were very successful  did they teach me how to be an entrepreneur  not on your life  it's called here i am if you want to try and learn from me watch me and follow me or do what you want but there's no way they're going to hold your hand and say here's how you do it laugh   so there's no training ground  you know if you go in to be anything a plumber a carpenter if you go into ah uh a computer situation you're going to have somebody teaching you the skills  as an entrepreneur they're not going to teach you the skills  you're gonna going to have to learn them on your own  so let's assume everybody can be an entrepreneur  you've got a vision a direction  you're not allowing yourself to be swayed off track  then the question becomes is where's the opportunity what's the idea where do we find the good idea  and very few had to be fun and guts    in other words it has to be fun has to be something you like to do or otherwise you'll get bored with it or you won't you won't even want to spend the time on it 
Canada	 and the other aspect of it it has it has   to be uh profitable has to be something in it has to be some money otherwise it's a hobby  normally there uh eighty a hund  hundred ah eighty percent of business ideas come from people's hobbies or their work   uh in your working situation working for somebody else you'll find business opportunities sometimes selling your services back to your employer as a contractual worker   you'll be in a win-win situation  in other words if you can work from home and do everything you're doing at work and show your employer how to pay you less and no benefits no no whether sick days no vacation and at the same time now you get to write off all the expenses  then you've just found a business opportunity  hobbies are another big area for business opportunities   well my name is jessica mailing   i am a volunteer here at the gallery and what i'm to do this afternoon is to take you on a tour of the upstairs galleries  mainly european some american   uh and the tour's normally an hour long  and you know just go along and look  the gal the galleries are arranged chronologically in a big v starting here going down there across the the ah the the bottom and then up here  if you look across to there you can see a word  so we're getting up into fairly modern art over there  and since that's the way we're going to go i just do uh a sort of a cursory development of uh art art   we'll have a little bit of art history  we'll have some looking at paintings  you know just what whatever you you want to do  are you interested in anything in particular   answer   hm  answer   italian paintings  ya   we're starting right here with italian paintings  this is uhm this is an italian  well let's start right here   uhm a painting by simone di martini of siena which is among the earliest things that we've got in the gallery  this was painted about thirteen twenty   it's uhm on wood   tempera on wood which the word hundreds  were uh on wood panels  this is word to be part of a triptych ah ah a three part probably a devotional piece  probably a private devotional piece  this would have been  the left hand side there would have been ah ah a middle one  somewhat larger  that was a mother and child and that one is still uhm on display in orvieto  the one on the other side is lost  they don't know where it is  but they the the way they can tell that the one in orvieto is part of one is because of this punchwork along here  this is called punchwork  and it exactly matches up with the one in orvieto  so th they they were at one time part of the same of the same triptych  uhm plain gold background  this was uh at this time they wouldn't have put a landscape in there or anything to distract  cos this is a religious painting you were supposed to concentrate on the uhm on the figure  who was st catherine of alexandria  now people of of that day  thirteen twenty would have known right away that this was st catherine  because uhm they they hid uh in religious paintings and and they're not only in  word ones some later ones uhm have got clues in them   attributes shown along with the saint that tell you who they are  and so catherine's attribute is a wheel because she was uhm  put to death or they attempted to put her to death on the wheel  tying her body to word wheels  and rather nasty results  well actually the wheel shattered and uhm she was freed and  she in the end she was beheaded   but the wheel is the attribute of st catherine  and wherever you see a picture of st catherine you'll find a wheel in it  uh sometimes on the ground  sometimes she's holding it  the wheel is her word   and it has the spokes that you usually find in in  the word   also to indicate that she was beheaded she has a sword in her hand here  she's got her hand around the top of a sword  and she has a pen to indicate that she was an author  so you see you've got all kinds of clues  they would also have known that she was uhm from a wealthy family by her clothing  by her halo you could tell she was a religious person  so a lot of things that go right over our heads were   uhm could be there quite easily in in   uh uh in the days that uhm that that   simone di martini was painting  but it's typical simone di martini  it's typical siennese in the beautiful elegant line of the siennese  the siennese did not were not so interested in modern inviting   although the use of shadow in her face here but it's pretty flat  pretty two-dimensional  but this is there's this marvellous line that comes up and you can just follow it around  very elegant  very uhm uh very graceful   now if you have any questions or you want to make any comments go ahead any time you want   uhm if not we're going to keep going cos if if  we're to get around here in an hour uhm we really have to keep moving   another italian painting uhm of the italian renaissance by piero di cosimo  uh and it is the italian renaissance and there are a number of things about it that indicate that this is is is  really what the renaissance was about  it it the subject of it is vulcan and aeolus  vulcan here with uh the sword  vulcan the glo god of fider uh   g god of fire   aeolus was the god of the winds  and he's shown here with a a huge pair of bellows making the wind that keeps the fire going   uhm the reference is to uhm first of all mythological  figures  vulcan and aeolus were were gods  and this is what the renaissance was about  going back to greek and going back to greek mythology going back to the early days  uhm as was the importance of the human being humanism  uhm and the beginning of man as the important thing  the beginning of civilization uh which was seen to begin when man got control of fire  up until this time uhm fire was was  something that happened but you couldn't control it and it was usually destructive  but uhm vulcan who this is brought fire to man and man could use it for his own uses to cook with  and here he's shown making horseshoes  and so with that comes civilization  and people began to tame animals  uh they begin to build houses  they begin to live in family units  and so you have uh the beginning of of  society and and this is another focus of of of the renaissance  uhm under that is a chest  it's called a cassone chest  that's the italian word  it's well i suppose it's sort of like a hope chest   uhm it was what brides got and grooms got it too to put   their their uh belongings into  it was used in a home uh for as a place to sit as a as a place to put things  the reason it's here there here is not because they want to demonstrate a cassone chest but it is here to inform these two paintings over here   two little paintings done by uh filipino lippi who was an italian renaissance painter working probably in the workshop of botticelli  and these paintings when they were made they're not made to hang on the wall in a sense like you see them here  they were made to go on a cassone chest  and cassone chests were uhm very often decorated with three paintings  and you read it well in a series  you read em them read it starting over there on the left end  that would be the first part of the story  then a big painting across the front  and then the denouemount would be uh on this end here  and so these are two that were commissioned by an italian family  one was the story of esther the the the  jewish biblical heroine  and the other one was the story of mordecai  esther went on the woma woman's  the the the bride's  chest and mordecai on the groom's chest   and uhm this one here the the  esther did the bottecelli did not do the painting  or it's not known exactly whether he did or not but it's thought  that he probably turned it over to filipino lippi who was one of his star pupils and who did a lot of these cassone chests  so you see esther uhm approaching the palace  uh the king has sent for a number of young women to come in  he's going to pick a new wife   and that is the one in the far end  and the big one here which is in france shows the king with the women assembled who does pick esther  and the one on the end which is in the horne museum in florence shows her leaving   uhm now it it's typically  italian renaissance in the grace uhm the beauty the elegance of the form uhm the way she's seen approaching the castle but hesitant about it because she doesn't know what's gonna going to  happen and what she's getting into  and the hesi hesitance is indicated by the way her foot is dragging and the way her dress is sort of dragging not coming along  and this is echoed by the tree here  the shape of the tree you see it has the same graceful shape the same lines as she has with a little bit of that  that suggests here the shrubberies here  this is is it was one of the first uses of landscape in the picture  it's called supportive landsch landscape   and it supported the main figure  so you see esther coming up in this very elegant fashion  to uh the the and and and   the colours and and the rendition uh that was typically renaissance  the other one is mordecai  this was a groom's chest  and this tells another story  mordecai on the first panel comes to esther and tells her that the king has issued an edict saying that all jews will be put to death  and she is jewish but the king does not know it which seems to me to be a peculiar part of the story but anyway  uhm this is in the book of esther   uh he says to her come and talk to him and see if you can talk him out of this  it's as much as her life is worth to go into the presence of the king without being summoned and so she hesitates  she doesn't know what to do but in the end she decides that she must risk her own life to try to free her people  she goes  uhm and that is the large one uh sh  showing her coming into the presence of the king  she talks the king out of his edict  and this is the final one where you see mordecai coming out of the castle and the horse is being led by haman who is the man who  proposed the edict in the first place and he's now reduced to the  word of the groom and leading mordecai's horse  mordecai is victoried victorious   the horse is prancing  it it almost seems to me as though the horse is laughing   uhm so these these uhm this is these are  the stories  this is the kind of art that was being done at that time  and uhm it it gives us another idea  of of art and what art was used for when we you know when you can see a cassone chest and know   that uh that that was used uhm to uh  to uh decorate the chests 
Canada	 you don't have the confidence yet as a teacher and uhm  confidence uh adds up to two things  i was talking uh over lunch  because i taught the morale enseignement de morale   you know what that is multiple audience members respond    yeah i taught in a small village and it's the parents  okay   it's the parents who say that you know you could  you c my kid instead of learning catholic for religion he can learn morale   so that i had three students audience members laugh    laugh so you have three students and  it was kind of a discussion kind of thing and uh yeah  yeah kinda kind of like this   audience member says something   that's what i'm talking about  and what it said in there is that confidence is  theory plus experience  so you have the theory now but you don't have the experience   you're just gonna going to have to kinda kind of go through with it  and and think about it and think who  who you want to be as a teacher  and remember i think what you said at first you know that you're a teacher you wanna want to be a teacher  and you had your reasons   and uh the more you you you you think about that the more your the true objectives stay there and you won't be so bogged down by all the political you know kind of thing that can happen   uhm do want wha wo do you guys want me to talk about discipline now or is uh   yeah if you like uh that seems to be a point that uh   audience member responds   would you like me to talk about discipline  what what is your greatest thing that is uh worries you the most about discipline   audience member responds   well wha wha what nothing  to think about at all  audience member responds   yeah   audience member responds   imagine you're a third year so laugh   audience members laugh   audience member responds   word   right  audience member responds   right  audience member responds   very good   right  audience member responds   okay   very good  audience member responds   okay  audience member responds   sure  okay  audience member responds   audience member agrees   well that's all gonna going to  happen   you know you that's important to understand is that like what you're worried about now is going to happen  i mean you you're gonna  going to have situations in which students aren't respectful  you know you're gonna going to have situations probably you've already had one   audience member agrees   and you will have those situations in which students pick up on that   okay  discipline is a part of life in teaching  okay  it's an ongoing thing  i think uh a it's like if you're a parent okay eh if you're parenting it's the same thing it's an ongoing thing   and a discipline problem word   that you can that you have with a group is your problem too  okay  maybe you're not responsible for it  okay i used to get upset when uh when   the school director used to you know say it's the teacher's responsibility to two or three words   i said listen i'm not the one throwing erasers you know  laugh audience members laugh   you know what i mean like there's a part but there's also a question of discipline is something you're gonna  going to have to deal with  it's the most tiring part of the job but it's part of it   and i bet you we even have it at a university level  at college level i bet   audience member comments   pardon  audience member comments   yeah laugh right   audience member laughs   you know i think it i think it's   always there that discipline kinda kind of   thing  and i believe the reason is okay   barram barra trumpet noise audience members laugh   laugh i believe the reason is   we are very we all have different ideal of what discipline is   you know i'm a very strict person in a in a  let's say in my school terms  you know with my just the fact that i'm mister scott audience members laugh   it was the first time that they've had that  in about i don't know how many years  a stu student  the teacher come in and say i'm mister scott i'm not hey andy   and that's up to you to say that  cos when you're gonna going to go for your first day they're gonna going to go what you  wanna want to be called mister   huh mumbles two words they  mumbles two words they don't mind audience members laugh   they don't mind you know  very fast sentence   what i meant is that they go  the kids they're nice you know   the kids are okay  they don't show any more disrespect than if you're mister scott  or if you're andy   and you go that's okay but i'm mister scott   you know what i mean  you have your   cos respect is your respect   they say you shouldn't be don't demand  respect they say that you earn respect  baloney audience member laughs   you ask for respect  because you're a person   you know what i mean  if a student go ugh moans in disrespectful manner you go hey you don't talk to me like that  it's not ugh   you know i'm your teacher and you are  and if you wanna want to speak to the student after you speak to the student after  you're gonna going to call p  st uh the student's parents you're  gonna going to call the parents students speaker does not say 'of the'   you know what i mean  if you're gonna going to do something you're gonna going to do it  it's tiring   it's the longest part of the job but you're gonna   going to have to deal with it  you're gonna going to have to deal with it over and over again  but what you have to understand is that a student who does something like that like oh leave me alone  what you have to understand is that okay he might be against you sometimes but quite often it's just the way that they are it's just that you don't accept it   i'll i'll give you a a  trick   something when you meet your students for the first time  a student who has you have problems with   okay   la la

board for about ten seconds   i don't know if there's two ns   is there two ns word unacceptable  pronounced inacceptable   audience member responds further audience members respond speaker keeps writing on the board   audience member corrects speaker   unacceptable   word said that  i was thinking that  unacceptable speaker finishes writing on the board   i go  there's acceptable and there's unacceptable   and what you did to me in front of the class today   okay if they did something they said word  or word or  something like that   audience member laughs   or if they say uh you know oh je m'en fous or anything like that  for me that's unacceptable   unacceptable behaviour in my class  unacceptable to me   and i want you to write a letter of apology signed by your parents for tomorrow audience members sound amazed   and then and then they go  and that's it  and they go and if they want to say something  that's up to you if you wanna want to   hear it   you said what you had to say   if they start arguing and that you say bye   audience start talking   bye  we did we talked you know  i told you what i had to say audience member coughs   you know   audience member asks a question   then you call the parents   then you write the report   i would even write the report right away  you know that they have these reports now   audience member makes a comment   yeah a fiche   if i were  oh you you say it too to johnny   yeah  that as johnny's there  you say it's unacceptable  i don't agree with what you said  i want a letter  if well no no say give me the write the letter and if you don't write the letter then i'm  gonna going to do a fiche uh   audience member comments   yeah  but i would even do sometimes i do it  right away   you know do it right away   you know say you're gonna going to get  it right away you have the fiche nothing else happens and then there's no big deal but it's done   audience member comments   audience member responds   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   okay  audience member comments   mm hmm   and what happens too is uh   audience member comments   right   well word it's yeah and and  also ye ye you    and   audience member comments  it's  yeah sure   two words it's  it's a good thing that  audience member comments   audience member comments  right  audience member comments   right   so you're even better off you know to to if  that happens even if it's the first time uh  cos the guy or girl may say something they would never ever say but because you're a new teacher they think they can  they can do it  so uh quite often you do that right away even with the  fiche word even with the s dossier  do it right away and you might not have any problems at all for the rest of the year with the student   audience member asks   audience member replies   audience member asks   yeah they know   that's the basis   audience member comments   audience member comments   you don't wanna want to  threaten them too much  audience member laughs   altogether eh  you don't wanna want to threaten them  word   audience member comments   yeah audience members laugh     cos then they're gonna going to  laugh at you audience members start commenting as speaker continues   and you're gonna going to end up writing ten thousand of them and none of it's not gonna  going to do anything  you know what i mean it's that that   balance of of discipline audience members stop commenting as speaker continues   audience member agrees   you you do discipline   you're always gonna going to have to do discipline  but you do it when it's important and you and you do it until  what what i'm trying to tell you is that   when you deal with discipline you always're gonna  going to have to deal with it   you deal with it till the end of the line   don't be don't be slack about it  you know  don't be lazy about it and go oh i talked to them and i gave him a good talking to and now he's okay you know  make the kid know that you're you're   on your job  you're doing your job  and you're going to get more respect from the other students  cos   audience member starts comment   audience member continues comment   that's right   audience member comments   yeah they're gonna going to  talk about it   that's right  i had a really good intervention this year in which i  i called a parent's student   tsk excuse me  audience member laughs   i called a parent's called a parent's student  i called a student's parents  audience member laughs   and uh sigh   they they uh   i said i'm calling your parents and i called them   and uh they grounded him for a month audience members amazed   i think that he acted up in our class   they grounded him for a month  and he was a kid who was like acting the most up in my class  and his parents said it was the first time a teacher called  audience members amazed   yeah well i'm not su sure   but it's it's   i'll be you'd be surprised at how many  t teachers don't  don't do it  so you know   and  audience member comments   and then i i i   didn didn't i only  only found out about this later eh cos i   call called n he was acting up again okay  i made him copy out a page  but well he was just not listening okay  and i said it's very simple in my class  you read while i'm reading  you read with me  and if you're not you copy that page   it's very simple  and and and and and he wasn't  so i said are you gonna going to copy that page  and i said and call your parents  laugh starts he goes no don't call my parents  laugh ends audience members laugh   so i said i'm going to call your pa  parents   and he comes out of class please please please don't call my parents 
Canada	 i'll be nice   i'll be nice  i promise  i didn't know that they they grounded him for a month before  i said no i have to  i have to call your parents and you have to  audience members comment and laugh   i wrote down his phone number and i go and i call his parents but it was busy so that ah forget it  and they called and i i didn't call back  and the next day i saw him he was like thank you laugh starts thank you laugh ends with a sigh of relief audience members laugh   it was it was uh a okay  audience member comments   sure  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   definitely  audience member comments   definitely  audience member comments   definitely  audience member comments   wow  audience member comments   yeah sure   audience member comments   that's different yeah   audience member comments   but that's uh   and i think that's uh i think the important point here is the warning that you're giving  we're talk talking   we're still in the beginning of the year here   you're at the warning of the st   student of to the student   audience member comments   and the parent   audience member comments   sure  audience member coughs   yeah   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   oh yeah definitely  audience member comments   sure  audience member comments   mm hmm   and and what goes on is this kind of blaming game  audience member agrees   there's never any blaming game that goes on in the teacher's knowledges and and and it's the idea of let's blame the parents  let's blame the direction uh you know  but it's time that that you take uh  your own responsibility for your class   you know if you take that that that idea of a student who is failing or or you know who's having a problem you call them  i tell you it's incredible the help that you get from the parents  word   word there's no more strong   there's no more stronger political tool in the education system in my point than than the parents  if you have the parents on your side you're laughing   you know your bosses your your your  principal might be against you the school commission might be afraid of it  but if the parents are with you laugh   and that happens i i've seen it over and over again   uh but staying with discipline  okay i'm gonna going to tell you that there's different kinds of of uh of students  okay   there's the ones which that will work very well   there's one warning after class letter of apology  you can get this letter of apology   and it says you know i'm sorry dadadadada  the kid's gonna going to be great  word   you're gonna going to have that   it's gonna going to happen     audience member comments   ask for it in french  and and it and it's   gotta got to be sincere   with some  i'm talking about a certain amount of student   students   there're students who who fool around and they realize that it wasn't right and they're  gonna going to be sincere and saying they're sorry and they're gonna going to be okay  they might even give you a good reason   which happens  you know there could be something a good reason   then there's the second type of student   who can be okay but you have to keep reminding  them   okay   you're gonna going to   ha have you're gonna going to  it's gonna going to  work  but you're gonna going to have to maybe do it two or three times during the year   and you're gonna going to have to be more you know straight   okay that's another type of student   okay you're gonna going to write a report   you're gonna going to write the the the dossier   you're gonna going to call the parent  and you might have to write another dossier and bring it  to the principal and say there must be something done about this student   okay   this student needs a more severe warning   okay   this student might just need to be suspended from school okay  this student might just need the meeting with parents   okay  it's a student who has more problems  that's the second   but they still can you know they still function and but every once in a while friday afternoon  that kind of thing  then there's the third category okay   they are what i would call in the true sense of the meaning  the rebels  the ones who hate school   who have to go to school   and who just want to fool around   and who know the system well enough because they've been in trouble most of the time that they know how to s   they know how to slide three words  audience member coughs   you better know you better be on your toes   cos they'll they'll just swim around you you know  and one minute you'll say something and they'll   they'll get you on another thing on a detail  i never said that   you never did that   you didn't write it down   they know the fiche  they know what you have to write down   they know all these things   okay  you you're not allowed to make me do that  dadadada dadada   very complicated school word student to deal with   i had a student like that   i had more than one student like that   and there're not many though okay  there there aren't that many okay  uh it's a category in which uh you know oh not again category   and you're gonna going to have to deal with this student   okay and it comes down to this   this is what i want  yes  audience member tries to say something   okay   this is what i want to tell you about this student and what to do about this student okay as a teacher   okay if you have this student in your class   what do you do about this student   have a discussion with the student  you sit down   and you say   i don't know what to do with you anymore   okay i don't know what to do   i've tried everything   i don't know what to do   i'm gonna going to ask for you to be suspended from school   and i'm gonna going to do everything in my power to get you out of my class   because you have the right to education but so do the other students in my class   and it's not you who's gonna going to  stop that   and then you speak with the principal   you write a letter to the school commission   saying for the right of education for the other students you do not accept this student  i do not accept this student as a teacher   it's a hardline kind of approach   but it definitely   you've ren   what you're doing is you're telling the student if you don't like school then get the hell out   you know what i mean  that's what you're telling the student   i'll respect you if you get out of my school if you don't   wanna want to stay   or stay and follow the rules   you know what i mean   but what we do is we we kind of  play around with with these students  we let them get off we let them be okay  we word i'll give them another chance give them another chance give them another chance give them another chance give them another chance until it's  until you're a joke basically   you know they don't e they just laugh at you if you think about   what you're doing is making the kid make a decision   are you gonna going to stay are you gonna going to go   and i had a student like that and and   he decided to stay   and the contract you sit there you don't say a word   like other students   there're students who are like that you know calm students  they sit down they don't say a word they listen they do their work  and that's what you do   if they have a question they'll come and ask you   that's just for the third type   do you have any other questions about uh   audience member asks a question   mm hmm  audience member continues   pardon  audience member continues   oh okay  yeah   audience member continues   that's very difficult   what did you do  audience member continues   right   audience member continues   mm hmm   audience member laughs   audience member continues   it's a very difficult problem hyperactive kids  audience member continues   sure  audience member comments   yes  audience member continues   that's right   audience member continues   yeah   audience member continues   right   audience member continues   that's right   audience member comments   mm hmm   audience member comments   mm hmm  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   mm   audience member continues   definitely   audience member continues   definitely   audience member continues   yeah   audience member comments   i think that's a good point   like every time you have a discipline problem ask yourself why   why did you have that problem   that's what i usually cos whenever i have a problem a discipline problem it goes back to that idea of any group of kids can certainly become problem  and it's usually has to do with the way you you   you presented your activity  it usually has w the activity itself  you know always question the activity that you're working with  you know  but what i'm what i that's that's a part of class management  and uhm but what i what i'm trying  to to say is that you will always have discipline problems  and you have to deal with the discipline problems  this this this uhm student that you have okay a student who is hyperactive  you're gonna going to have to deal with that student for the rest of the year  so you're gonna going to have to find ways to deal with that student   you're gonna going to have to you know  you have no choice   the thing that that that that that that  is a a big problem today in teaching in my  opinion is that a lot of teachers think they have a choice  and that choice is to do nothing but that's not a choice cos you're just  gonna going to have more discipline problems  you're gonna going to have  many many many more discipline problems than if you s take it  head-on and you think about it you know  and you try to find solutions  i think discipline problems the worst discipline problems  turn into solutions   the kids that you'll have the problems with could become your best students after   you know these things will happen  when i'm tea you know that it sounds  ah you know like that kid isn't i the  wor worst the ones who  who cause you the most problems could be your best most interesting students you know   could be the most dynamic could be the funniest you know  could be the most creative   but they're they're wasting their time in school  and they give up   they've given up in school a lot of them you know  like they find it boring and stupid  did you something you'd like to say   audience member comments   yeah  audience member comments   okay  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   laugh   audience member comments   oh god  audience member comments   uh huh   audience member comments   sure  audience member comments   yeah sure  audience member comments   yeah  audience member comments   yeah eh  audience member comments   yeah eh   but it's amazing how they can uh   if you can t   cos the energy is there right   the energy uh  i think one of the big things  you know i don't know how much we have  about ten minutes left eh  audience member replies   yeah laugh   okay  but the laugh audience laughter   audience member comments   yeah laugh audience laughter    audience member comments   audience member comments   okay yeah   sure   audience member laughs   but the uh i think one of the the the   that's a good point   and that's a good point too laugh  audience members laugh   i can see all of your points   and the idea is that you have   one of the things you'll notice when you walk in the classes  is each class has its energy you know  and a a class can have a negative energy like a class can have a positive energy  and what you what class management has to deal with in in uh in uh in uh teaching what class management has to do is how you're going to control  or manipulate that energy to k make it into a positive energy  a learning energy   your goal is always learning  so you have to think of ways to do that okay  and that has a lot to do with motivation okay  how you're going to motivate your students   and what i'm trying to tell you is you have your first part which is very traditional teaching and then you have to start  learning how to motivate your students and to make your class more interesting  cos the traditional will not work that long right  you know what i mean  li like you you   you   you know how long you do vocabulary you know what i mean before they catch on laugh audience members laugh   word   it's true laugh   so you have to you have to start  you know getting more and more  and it's a kind of a tricky  and i'll tell you this is the this is  when you're gonna going to be more insecure  because you'll have the students okay like uh you have them   in your in their s places and you're doing vocabulary you're walking around and you're going okay what's this word and you know you're kind of arr arr arr funny noise you know you got your   and then word you're not  gonna going to start making them do group work  and cooperative learning and and then you start getting scared  cos it's insecure right  it's an insecurity cos you're gonna going to let it you're gonna going to  let your whole structure grow into a new one and you have to know how to do that transition 
Canada	 okay i've come today to speak to you essentially about tesl and  the community and job opportunities in the greater montreal area   uh i'd like to begin by discussing my personal experience in  tesl a little bit   uh i began i guess considering teaching as an option in my life  about three and a half years ago   i was in a dead end job uh with an incomplete b a in english literature   uh i had a family which had just began  my daughter was uh just a month old or so   and i was investigating the possibilities of becoming a teacher  i had heard of the concordia program i had i had some counselling uh career orientation counselling  and i had pretty much fixed my idea on becoming a teacher   except of course i had a family and a job and it's sometimes difficult to laugh starts separate yourself laugh ends from  that stable income to uh launch yourself into another career   well i guess destiny kind of helped me along because  it was the beginning of a major recession and uh being the last in i  quickly became the first out laugh starts   so laugh ends i found myself on unemployment  uh no b a nothing and i decided to join concordia and the tesl department   the way in wasn't that easy   uh it's a very difficult program to get into  they have very high expectations for you and uh they have very high demands about your qualities coming into the program   uh i ended up in the philosophy program here   and i still have a year to do to get a b a in philosophy at concordia but uh  i after one session there proving myself to be an exceptional student i was accepted into the tesl program   uhm i'd like to talk about tesl in in in  uh terms of pre while and post  and those who are in tesl will understand the uh  the joke with that  uhm i've already described my pre-tesl life and uh now i'd like to describe the while in the program   tsk and i think essentially uh tesl is a   prepar preparation for both a profession  and a vocation  uh teaching is a mix of both science and art   uh you have to be you have to be prepared to be uh artistic in the design of activities and the way you implement material  but you also have to be a scientist in the sense that you must observe group behaviour you must observe individual behaviour  and you must uh de you must  uhm tsk evaluate individuals and you must do this objectively  so there's a very scientific aspect to teaching   uh i think the tesl program provides you with i call the five ps  uh it has a program that is bo uh that is very balanced between learning theory language learning and linguistics   uhm and it's getting better  next year there's a new four year program being implemented  which will augment the number of practice hours and i imagine also methodology and the courses will be expanded   uh i think the second p for tesl is people   the people at uh two levels  the staff and the students  the staff uh in the tesl department are leaders in their fields  and they are leaders in the research of language learning and language teaching   the people who teach in tesl are quality teachers and uh who  sincerely care and are concerend about your future   uhm the students are heterogeneous in the sense that we have students from all over the world uh with many different experiences and varied backgrounds   and uh they're all very interesting and intelligent people to work with   uh tesl program also gives you the practice you need uh to become a teacher   uh it's not an easy profession and tesl itself applies to many different levels and we get that experience  we teach adults   we teach at the secondary level and we teach at the primary level  uh we had in my time a hundred and fifty hours of practice teaching and this will be soon seven hundred hours with the new program which uh i think is adequate  uh w i think a hundred and fifty hours was just a drop in the bucket in terms of tesl experience  and uh you have the chance to practice creating materials  creating lessons being a creative teacher   there's also a lot of progress you witness in tesl you progress personally and uh professionally   and finally i think tesl gives you a perspective on teaching  the role of the teacher   the role of the student   and on language learning   and all this comes out to opportunity  and there is a lot of opportunity in quebec for tesl people   uh there's private schools for both adults and young people camps  things like that   the cegep programs are expanding  uh which in turn means the secondary school programs are expanding  uh there's even work in publishing and sales in quebec  there's a lot of publishing of uh english language learning materials here   uh in the public system and the school commissions there's the primary level we are uh trained to teach at both primary and secondary and we are given a certificate in which we can teach at both primary and secondary   and there's a lot of adult teaching as well in uh the school commissions  i think that uh clears throat there's going to be even an expansion at that level with   with the effects of the last election i think english will only become more important to the people of quebec   uhm how do you get a job though once you come out of a program  you come out of a program you've been provided with a certain number of skills and techniques about teaching   you're provided with a certain amount of theory about teaching  but that doesn't help you get a job   laugh and uh that's i guess the big uh obstacle once you finish your program   uhm tsk i think though that tesl also provides you an opportunity to network yourself   when you're doing practice teaching sessions you get to know the people at the school   you try to contact uh these people afterwards about supply teaching  uhm you have to send out c vs and a lot of them  it costs laugh starts money  it costs a few hundred dollars laugh ends but you send  good quality c vs in french with letters of reference from professors and uh  uh cooperating teachers   letters of attestation of your uh sch   of your uh education   it takes time before you get your b ed  it takes time before you get your certificate or your permit from the ministry of education   get the documents from concordia  they can provide you with certain documents that will help you get a job   and provide a good cover letter in french  you're dealing with a french school commission  you have to demonstrate a certain ability to communicate in french  if you're weak get somebody laugh t   to translate a letter for you   get that first step in the door  they think you can speak french   good that's the first step   uh you'll end up going through interview processes where uh five people are interviewing you uh   school principals  the heads of school commissions  the heads of uh the human resources department   are all flinging questions at you in both english and french for about thirty minutes of time   you have to be able to switch languages quickly and efficiently  and finally if you get through all that you may even have to take a french exam   and uh that's another thing you should prepare yourself for   uh you should prepare yourself for in advance  uh the french demands vary   i know that if you want to teach in montreal with the uh catholic school board here   uh your french better be as good as as a native speaker  other school boards have special tests for the english teachers which have been reduced in uh expectations  uhm i was very lucky  uh since i left concordia i've had many job opportunities many job offers   uhm i went through three interview processes  i was selected in two of them   one of them was uh a little far from montreal in uh a small town called bellingham near gaul where they asked me to teach primary in grades four five and six in three different schools  as a specialist at the primary level you're often teaching in more than one school   uhm i had clears throat verbally accepted the job but no contract was signed fortunately because shortly thereafter i had another interview and i was selected to teach uh secondary school here  close to montreal in repentigny   and presently i'm working in uh l'&eacute;cole secondaire  jean-d-aulps   uh it's a big school   it's uh   although the uh principal said we're not allowed to use those words about our school laugh   it's not big  it's not large   it only has two thousand six hundred students   uh in the second cycle of secondary  so we're talking about secondary three four and five only   uh we have twelve hundred students in secondary three  five hundred and fifty in secondary four   four hundred and fifty in secondary five and   four hundred students uh following individual uh educational programs   uh you can see then the school itself is a community   the size of our schools in quebec especially at the secondary level uh it's not uncommon to find schools of at least two thousand students   uhm and this is a whole socia social  network a whole community in itself   in my school m in my school  the staff itself 's is two hundred people  we have a hundred and sixty teachers   we have five vice principals  we have two psychologists   and at least another fifty professionals and support staff   as a teacher you teach probably four five six different groups  so you're dealing with a hundred and eighty individuals on a daily basis   i can't say that i've had a great deal of experience  teaching i've only maybe taught in a high school for ten weeks of time  but it's amazing what you see in those ten weeks   uh i've seen both positive things and negative things  and i use that word carefully   uhm on the negative side i've been through bomb scares  riots stories of suicide drugs and alcohol pregnancy  incest psychological abuse and just general disrespect for adults and authority  on the other side on the positive side when you work in a school of this size you really feel that there is a sense of community  this is a community in itself  there's also a sense of care that all the staff members  have for the students and for their success  we all desire the same thing that our students succeed   uh there's team work spirit idealism again on the part of the staff but also on the st part of the students   there's a tendency in teaching to focus in on the three students in the back who are creating the problems in your classroom but don't forget about the other twenty-five who are there for a reason and who want to learn   there's also the one-on-one relationships you have with  students   uh their vision is sometimes naive  but it's very heart-warming sometimes to see that naivety and that idealism   uh and just the contact you have with students  i walk down the hallway near the cafeteria at lunch and i'm greeted fifteen times in the space of five minutes   and that's a good feeling as a person  it uh it it gives you it validates your   experience in the school   so i don't want to let the negative sides over   overcome the positive side  but when you're dealing with such a large number of people you're dealing with a real cross-section of society and those things that you see on the news once a week or twice a week uh become real to you  uh they take a face they take a name 
Canada	 this one here is carved  it was another  somebody had deeply carved and then they decorated them  okay any any questions about that   uhm alright we'll 10 second pause tape cuts out   uh alright now uhm well there's  we're into the northern renaissance in this room which came   later than the uh later than the italian renaissance and we have a number of uhm well-known  let's start over here with the memling   well-known northern renaissance uh artists  this one is is hans memling uh who was flemish and it is uh uhm the virgin and child with saint anthony abbot up here and the donor  the donor is on his knees and he is is  uhh worshipping in the presence of the virgin and the child  uh he has given a sum of money to have the painting painted uh given the money to the church  he's shown with saint anthony abbot which might mean that his name is anthony  often they chose a patron of the same name   uhm saint anthony abbot we know because his attribute is here  his attribute is a pig   and so you usually see a pig lurking around somewhere in a painting of sa of saint saint   anthony  it shows the four of them  it it shows them quite clearly  you see the the tiled floor and the virgin's throne and you even see a landscape uh out of doors  now you particularly in the north they did these detailed landscapes seen through a window or a door  but you also have the idea they're in the same space and yet they're not in the same space  if if uhm the different in the lighting  the different in the uh the uh faces  they they're no there's no uh joining of glances  they're not looking each o other  at at each other   so it's as if mary and the child are are  existing in a ah maybe an ideal or an imaginary world compared to these two who who are are are  in the real world  there's a there's a separation there  uhm the child is in has his hand  in the in the blessed position with his with his fingers up like this     question   uh maybe a symbol maybe just ah ah a word  you know a few words like the apple  maybe just just you know ah ah ah part of the picture a form of the picture   now we also have two pictures in this room by uhm lucas cranach who was uhm uhm one of the word german  artists a friend of d&uuml;rer  uhm this is one of his religious uh religious paintings uhm the ta the woman taken in adultery   and it's ju the fi   figures in the background are are  the typical german faces that seem to be almost like gargoyles  some of them are are very ugly very  well almost vicious  you see a number of them like that  but cranach also did a number of uhm erotic nudes   uh he was ah a close friend of luther   luther who started the the the  reformation  uh they were close family friends  they were godfathers to each other's children  and uhm sometimes that when you think of that it seems rather surprising that cranach would have done uh so many nudes but it's thought that it was one of the electors of saxony where he was working who had a taste for these nudes and was commissioning the work on it  cranach was uh was painting them to please him  they uh this one is called venus   they're venus  they're uh diana  they're uh eve  they they have many names uh but they are all excuses to paint uhm an erotic nude  uh they're fairly gothic  it they they're kind of straddling   the the the gothic period and the the   the renaissance  it's renaissance in that he goes to the myth  the mythology venus and and uhm diana and those sorts of things but the the the   figure is is gothic  this was a a a typical rendition   of of a beautiful woman elongated small head sloping shoulders prominent abdomen uhm   that that that is the gothic ideal  uhm she's naked except for her jewellery  and this gauzy thing that she holds around here  over over her the the  genital area up until i don't know if it's two years ago now she wore a fig leaf  she this fi figure   had a fig leaf when the gallery bought her   the the painting  and it was obvious that it had been put there not by cranach but many years thereafter by at the order no doubt of the subsequent uh owner   and after a lot of uh thought and research and examination they decided that it would be safe to remove it  they the theory with conservation is if  something is known not to be of the artist's hand and if it can be safely removed you do it  so they they did  they took uh the fig leaf off and layer after layer of  heavy yellow varnish  this picture was a different colour be when be  be before this was done  and it it did become obvious as they worked that the the fig leaf had been put on because of the layers of varnish under it there were layers of varnish over it   uhm so she she she's shown here as uhm a sort of a vapid uhm kind of expression on her face  you know there's been talk of it of it  being pornographic  she doesn't have enough s presence or enough  there's not enough to her i think to to to to   constitute uh pornography  she uh venus of course came out of the sea  venus aphrodite rose from the sea and that's indicated by  the uhm the the rocky seashore at the bottom  ah the rest of it all dark with her right on the front  you concentrate on her  and another little interesting point here is cranach's signature  his signature is uhm a dragon with the wings raised   and at some point one of his sons died and after that the wings were lowered  so you can think of cranach more or less by  whether the wings are are are up or down   okay   question   word   exclamation tape cuts out   now this uhm this is the baroque gallery  baroque is seventeenth century   and uhm it's hung in the way most seventeenth century galleries are hung with this kind of dark background  it's often a green or it's a rose like this  the pictures are hung close together  some above the others  i think this is the only gallery in the place where there are pictures hanging up above each other  because as i say this is the way they were hung  and some p paintings were meant to be hung high  they they uh they uh they'd be out of proportion if you brought them down to eye level   uhm the the baroque art  is closely connected to the counter-reformation  after luther uh objected to the catholic church and some of what he says the excesses of the catholic church and uhm brought about the reformation which led to protestantism the catholic church  organized and organized a counter-reformation and  uh to to sort of fight back  and re-establish themselves  and one of the most powerful tools they had was art because art appeals to the intellect it appeals to the senses it appeals to the emotions it can tell a story   and so the popes of this time were great art patrons  and each pope had at least one artist uh that he uh gave commissions to and that that did his work and the kind of work  and the one i'd like to look at is uh bernini the great italian sculptor uh who was uh whose patron was pope urban the eighth  uhm he uh he they had worked together  before he became pope and after that they uh they uh  did did the work that   that urban always wanted  and he he's the the  sculptor that did most of the or many of the fountains  in rome   have you ever been to rome  answer   never in rome   well if ever you go you will see that the   the fountains in piazza navona and so on these are done by bernini  the work a lot of the work in st peter's the the uh the the uh uh the at the altar the baldachin and the great curved pillars that   uh that hold the the canopy over the altar  a number of things are the work of bernini   this is uhm uhm scuplture a portrait of the pope  commissioned by the pope uh over life-size very impressive but not at all formal  if you look at it you see that it's it's   very in informal almost to the to the point of being casual  the he's not dressed up in papal regalia  he's got uhm ah a little cap on  the cap is dented   uhm there are uh waves and wrinkles across his   his uhm cape  uhm bernini is demonstrating how he can use the marble and the carving of the marble to catch the light uh and to almost make flesh look real  if you get the a certain angle here with the light on that brown on the nose it looks almost like  like like flesh  uhm he's put in wrinkles around the eyes  he's put in wrinkles around the mouth  it's not idealized at all  it's not making the pope look as good as he could  it's it's you have the feeling that this is uh is what the pope really looked like and what he  since they were almost you know on a level of friendship he would be privileged to see him like this and this is the way he's   he was depicted in   uhm one of the treasures of this gallery uh often  picked out by people you know as being uhm one of the uh of the the the the treasures  in in the national gallery 10 second pause   uh let's see one other  let's look at this one over here for something different  many of the things in here most of the things i'd say are religious because as i pointed out b b  baroque art uhm was uhm to some extent a religious art  but here is one that is uhm is not  it's quite different  this is flemish   it's called as the old sing so the young pipe and it's by the flemish uh painter uhm jacob jordaens done about sixteen forty  now this is a painting that can be looked at and enjoyed on several levels  on the face of it uhh what you see is uhm a family uh sitting around a table enjoying themselves eating drinking  it's what what might be called a genre  painting people in their own home  uh this is what genre painting is peop  people ordinary people in their own home they're living  their their their life in a natural way  so you have a feeling this is maybe the way they sit around every night ah around the table and and it's  it's very sensuous  you you you get ah ah a strong appeal to the eyes to the uh to the s  sense of smell to the taste uh even uh to the  to the ears  uhm he contrasts beautifully the the   uhm what is it copper here or brass with glass and pewter and pattern  uhm the grapes look at look how  they're painted very very realistic  you can get a lot of pleasure just picking those things out   and and looking at them and looking at the people  and you you the the   moral as the old si uh sing   so they young tijdt or whatever it is  it's you know children will do as their children do   uhm and you see it in a couple of ways here  the man playing the pipe and right under him the little boy  playing the pipe imitating the father  and over here this is not actually a pipe  i think it's sort of a pacifier but it's the same sort thing imitating the elders  uhm also i think there's the message as as   the old overeat so the young are going to do  the baby's quite quite uh small but  it's already still uhm still little it's already  quite chubby 
Canada	 so there's that level you can look at it on  at that time though if you had looked at this painting if you looked it all over uhm your eye would li light  up here in this niche and you would realize this was a  vanitas or a memento mori   these are two terms that are that are used to describe a painting that it is really ah a reminder of death  that's what it is about  and you see these things  you see them in uh uhm  there's often a skull  a skull is a is a vanitas  symbol  ah a snuffed candle is a vanitas symbol  a bouquet of flowers is because the flowers are are  are fresh today but they're gonna going to wilt and die tomorrow  often there are a couple of flowers that have already fallen or some insects that are in the flowers  uh even the the pages up there  uh are an indication of this idea  it's and and the message is no matter how great your learning is no matter how well-read you are you we're all going to come to the same end  and there so there is this moral message  that that is there  there's also a political message and that is partly in this  music that the old lady is holding partly probably in this jester up here who is the artist  it's s self-portrait of the artist  and he's pointing to three birds that are caged  and this all refers to the political situation   uh flanders was under the yoke of spain  flanders was protestant  uhm they were trying to get out from under the yoke uh uh  of of spain uhh but uh uhh were not  and this refers to a huguenot song  uh i'm not just sure what the reference is but some sort of song that the soldiers sang   this up here probably is a reminder that uhm these birds are singing but they're in a cage  you people are having a good time you're eating and drinking and having music but you're you're caged  you're not free  so there's ah there there's a lot  and there's there's a lot more in the painting  it's chucked full of symbolism ***yes: chucked***  i'm not going to go into it cos we don't have time   okay  agrees tape cuts out   i think what stands out about it are the colours uh in it  we thought when it came in here that some of us thought that it had just been cleaned but it hadn't  that is the colouring in that is due to the fact that reni used uhm white undercoat  and uh most of the paintings in this room had  would start from a dark uh underpainting and paint up from that  he started from white and the and the  white glows through the uh the draperies and the flesh and everything and it's uh  that of course is uh uhm europa and and  jupiter the rape of europa tape cuts out   uh a rembrandt here that is one of uhm   o one one of rembrandt's fine works   and this also is esther probably  it's never been clear who she is  when it first came here sh she  it was called the jewish bride  then it was uh called susanna  it's now hailing from the old testament uh esther or bathsheba  well there are reasons to think that it's not bathsheba  there are reasons to  well it's hard to say but/-> but i  i think the current uhm idea among most people is that this is esther  the same esther that we saw out there going to the king  and that this is the moment when she has made up her mind that she's going to go to the king risk her life and a   ask that he uh lift this edict  uh the bible says that she spent three days in fasting and uh whatever and then she got herself dressed into a fine garment  and she had a handmaiden uh do her hair uh and and  off she went  and this it's thought that this is the moment that's pictured here  she's dressed in her velvet and with the gold trim and the beautiful  and it gives rembrandt you know the opportunity to paint this light uhm the the the contrast with the dark that he always has the dark background and then the light coming in from the left to pick up what he wants you to see  the the face a  and the the dips of her dress and particularly this hand because she's going through a great deal of inner turmoil  and the hand can be read to indicate uh you know this  this uh decision that she is in the process of making   and and how upsetting the whole thing is  uhm because rembrandt is coming up to the period where he's going to do the psych the the psychological  content in his paintings  the later rembrandt is is is uh has   a lot of psychological penetration in in uh  the the paintings and the portraits that he does  and so in her face you see some of this hesitation and this  indecision  uhm as you look at it you see more and more coming out of the background as you usually do  a table here with word on it   papers here that are  if you if you m if you accept this as esther the papers would be the edict that the king has  has signed   uhm and the handmaiden doing her  now this is something i didn't mention in the other room but this is another one of these vanitas symbols  the ages of life  in there there was an baby a young woman and an old woman  and wherever you see that combination it's this vanitas  thing  you know that as you as the baby  is it will grow older and and  it will grow old  and wherever you see this kind of a of a   combination a young woman and and the old face in the background that's probably a a a   vanitas   and the emphasis on the hand here because the important thing about that woman is that she's doing esther's hair  it's the hand that's important  so all these little things that that  rembrandt sounds like yelling in background puts into a painting but ahh   but just makes it uh so superb  and more dutch paintings in this room  another one here by nicolaes maes who was a pupil of rembrandt's  a woman making lace  ah a very uhm exhale breath   a a rush a dutch   uh housewife who is very uh frugal  her money bags are here  her books are open  she's making lace  she's making money  it's it's all uh  uhm and the light again is is coming in from the left to pick up the woman and the books the kinds of things that you're supposed to to concentrate on  and then some of the the landscapes here of word with those great skies the cloudscapes that the seventeenth century dutch did and that influenced uhm  oh people i impressionists uh uh proto-impressionists   constable also did did did skies like that  i keep forgetting tape cuts out   and we have canaletto here  we have a guardi over there  we have a couple bellottos   these people were known as view painters   they did views of venice  this was the time of the grand tour when the sons of the wealthy uhm particularly british wealthy went off on extended trips after their education  went all through europe  uhm it was the beginning of tourism when other people were traveling  venice was always a place uh that people wanted to go because of the atmosphere because of the water because of the buildings  and they wanted souvenirs like modern tourists do and so eh ah a a whole occupation almost came into being providing these view uh view painters  view view scenes   ah canaletto was the most popular of them  he did a number of l large ones  uh he also did small ones that people could take  they could commission them uh while they were there   so i think when you go into that transition okay i'm just gonna going to finish up with these little points here  when you're gonna going to go into that transition from traditional teaching to know the rules of the game  okay we start teaching know what it's into coo  cooperative uh the communicative  approach cooperative learning at these very fascinating these reasons that make you interested in e s l because it is fascinating you know  it's it's dynamic   that make you wanna want to get into that compared to the old traditional style   the tradition okay tra   transition   you have to do it only once you have the traditional  teaching in place   you understand what i mean   it is only when it works in your class that the discipline problems uh the big you know g class management is is settled that you will be able to start uh in more going more   towards commu the uh  communicative approach   you know why   why do you think that is  why do you think that would work   audience member responds   yes  audience member continues   okay   audience member continues   right  audience member continues   well i've used others too   audience member continues   it's not necessarily flight no  word   audience member continues   mm hmm  audience member asks a question   well the idea for example of vocabulary   audience member continues   well you know the example of of  starting with with not much uh team work uh working in a in a very structural kind of way of vocabulary grammar  audience member responds   audience member comments   study   audience member agrees   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right right  audience member comments   audience member agrees   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   definitely  you definitely can do it other ways  audience member agrees   that's for sure  that's not what i'm trying to question  you definitely can do it other ways  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   exactly   establish the rules and also have the trust of your students   okay that's what you want  you want the trust   you want them to go he's a teacher   okay that's that's what i'm trying to establish   that they go   cos you're you're a new teacher  you're new  see i want you to do the students to go  oh he knows the rules of the game  he knows how to teach okay  he knows how to give homework  he knows how to give tests   that's what i want you to do   and then you can start doing more interesting things   me it's music okay  for example me i use a lot of music  you you might want to do something else  you might do something else   you might do something else <,?  but you have to find it   and you have to develop it   and that's when it starts to become interesting   that's when that's when you get through the idea of uh of just being a traditional teacher and you start being yourself as a teacher  and that's when it becomes interesting   and that's what you want  audience member asks a question   i use it in many ways  i use it as uh for example with the uh  i use it a lot in in uh tsk  just in reading  with this you you come in and the song is on the table   and i ask the students to circle the words that they understand  tsk and then we'll sing the song together  and that's it   and then we'll start doing other activities  we'll start working on other activities  then i'll come and word some other class with words missing you know the old the words missing in the song and they have to listen to the song  audience member comments   and then that's it for that   and then we'll just sing   and then i might do something else where i take the song and now we're gonna going to practise really singing the song and you know that kind of thing  i did a really interesting an well uh activity i found quite good is uh with secondary three is uh they all  chose their own songs   and we listen to a song on a tape   they they have the artist  and then they give their opinion of the words of the song  they give their opinion of the music of the song  and how the song makes them feel  it was a song uh thing about feelings   so i made used that kind of thing   uh that's a good activity because they chose those songs     audience member asks something   you this is what i what i'm say  yeah what i'm trying to to uh  exp explain   this is the last point of what i want to tell you   okay that which for me is really important   is that if you don't get this trust going this first  trust in the first beginning   if you don't show that you're a competent teacher   if you don't know the rules of the game you're never going to teach the communicative approach in my opinion  the students might be in groups   the students might be doing activities   but the communicative approach is very difficult to teach  and it's not easy  it's not it's not hmm   i think a lot of people throw around the term and they don't really study it  it's it's something you have to study  to to uh to understand  and once you do it and you go and you start being  word   that's all i want to say   if there's any more questions   laugh audience laughter       audience member comments   audience member comments   yeah yeah   laugh audience laughter     audience member thanks guest speaker   audience applause   laugh audience laughter     audience member continues commenting   audience member agrees   yeah thank you for coming   i do uh appreciate that a lot  audience member says something   thanks 
Canada	 all of these rods and things four words  teaching multiplication laugh   and a word processing cabinet but laugh  but it's really good  it's really fun and it's really uh   i find it's very interesting way to teach the kids math right  i just four or five mumbled words   uhm and these kids really get to to use the stuff and think of ways of using math  so it's a it's a bit more interesting process but i mean i never taught math in my life  it never even occurred to me that i'd ever have to so   but uhm granted i teach the lower levels so i figured there was very little that i couldn't figure out the day before laugh but  you know when you have the plans if if  all of a sudden you didn't understand it the way it was written in the book and there aren't any more examples or activities in the book well you have to come up with more so  you get pretty busy   uhm i've gone off on all sorts of things so i  well i've already told you about word  classrooms word small groups  yeah so like you could you could  conceivably end up with a class at three levels but you have no more than twelve kids   so that's a big thing and  audience member comments   that's a word question  audience member asks a question   mmm not really  well uhm my first experience was in like i say in a small community and their exposure to english was so limited  they had at that time they only had one t v station so the only english they were hearing were from the five southern teachers who were there and actually that's not true because two of the primary two one of one of them was french so four southern teachers and the nurse  no he was french  so so you know the only english they ever heard was in school so i mean that's not a heck of a lot of exposure  so they they they kinda  kind of scared me my first day i go in there you know  the first day is always the worst day in the world no matter how many times you do it too laugh   the first day of the year is always bad  you don't know the kids and uhm go and ask them questions so what did you do this summer you know or anything  and this sea of little faces just stares back at you  whispering two or three words   nobody even tries  oh my god i'm gonna going to die  groan   they don't talk a lot either so it's like kind of a cultural thing  first start at the  they're not gonna going to be leaping going oh oh oh yes laugh   you know  the day you see that call me  laugh starts you know it's like that's a miracle laugh ends   that never happens  and so when they all sort of have varying language skills it's almost hard to find out whether they do or not because it's really hard to pull it out  but uh that group they they didn't talk a whole lot and so i found out that i had great expectations and all sorts of ideas of stuff that i'd been doing that really rapidly got cut down to size  and that's one of the things that you find no matter where you go  like uh i taught grade six the following year with  with word in inukjuak and i had fourteen students one level  and their language abilities i mean i was just  just floored they were just so completely different than the other kids  they they did english in grade three but they'd had consistent one level classes and and  consistent teachers probly probably like a couple of two of their teachers uhm had been in this village for like at that time three or four years so they already had a very good command of what they were doing and you could tell like we used to always say well like we know the kids that had gone from  from mabel to sandy or sandy to  mabel they switched levels at one point but  you could tell that these kids had gone through these teachers cos they were very very good teachers and they had a really really solid base  and there's no doubt in our mind it was these two teachers that had made a difference for these kids  uhm and so they they could talk up a storm if they had the desire to get do that  sometimes you word but  they definitely had uhh a higher level of of   english  but even so it's it's lower than   sta   we still there's still a long way to go  and i think we haven't challenged them necessarily enough along the way  i think a lot of the time we've sort of gone oh well we don't   wanna want to you know upset them and we don't want them to think they can't do it kinda kind of thing so uhm go a little under two words   that's my theory i d   i'm sure my colleagues would disagree with me on that one and certain word laugh   i feel they should be reading  certainly when i had my group my w   the other thing that happens is the longer you're there is the easier it gets and this is probably true wherever you would go but once you've taught the same level more than once then   but the third year is the greatest year laugh   it's like you've got it nailed by that time and you can do all these things that you've dreamt of doing before but you you  didn't have the energy to pull off  cos it takes a lot of energy   it takes a lot of energy to be on every day all day  and and you have to really really really be on the ball  and nobody ever seems to ever get sick because there's never any substitutes  so you go in if you're dying because you don't really you know you don't know what they're gonna going to do if they  they cancel school if they can't find a substitute for the kids  so you know that the kids are just gonna going to  have a day off which laugh may or may not be a good thing  laugh depending on how how things have been going they may want a break they may want to take a little pause  but i uhm it's i it's   very tiring  and by your third year two words you know what you can do and you know how   even though it's a different group  every year it's a different group right  no that's not true  actually in split levels you can often have the same kids  for up to two maybe three three or four years which that's  actually i'm sure that's worse i haven't had that experience myself but i'm sure that's worse for them uhh  muttering starts instead of changing having like the  five or six words end muttering   laugh   do all sorts of  and you have also all the two years of uh math sheets that you've laugh starts accumulated so that you don't have to do any more laugh ends   two or three words starts to wear off a bit though and you have to start recreating but uhm definitely  uhm i'm so far off of all sorts of things i'm not exactly sure uhm  would you like to see the video  audience responds   it's a vi uh  some of you were in the hallway talking with me so you know what i'm talking about  i brought a video that was made some of it was made my first year in the north  i didn't realize that till i saw it the other day uhm  it's just a visual thing that like there's no talking  word just a sound and and uh visual  loud white noise begins aaah i was trying to get this so it's at the right channel but uh  audience member asks a question   uhm just two or three words uhm i don't know we'll see how it what it looks like  i'm assuming it's not the right station yet  uhh it starts off this is  if you if you go to ungava side this is how you can get there once you get to kuujjuaq  uhm and it just takes you basically it takes you  to tasiujaq the little village and a couple of communities that i haven't quite figured out exactly where uhm  but it's kind of almost a year in the life of tasiujaq  there's there's there's a festival not a festival a wedding or something i can't member remember   what  and you go out fishing   so i may say things as we go along because i get all excited cos these are my old students laugh and stuff that are there  but it it's there's no classroom stuff it's all about 5 minutes of loud video, some untranscribed text   okay  they won a a a a fishing boat in halifax actually it was the word   and they hadta had to   the only way you can get there acourse of course  is to go all the way around all the way around labrador and   the day the boat arrived was like our third fourth week in school and the kids were all excited in the morning and i thought the  something was up  we didn't know what i mean   came back to school after lunch like we hadn't been in school fifteen minutes when every kid takes off out the door laughs with audience and all the teachers are standing there going what where'd they all go  we had no idea  and what had happened was the boat come in  and they'd known cos they could see it from afar in the morning but nobody really infor like especially the few of us that were new that year we had no idea th w   what was this boat what was this whole big thing  and i mean these the the the men in the village were on this boat they'd been gone for six weeks these kids hadn't seen their dads and all the women i mean the whole village  a j he gave me plenty of grief  really nice kid but boy was he a pain laugh   these are this is one of my other students too fishing  but that was like the big pen and that was it for school for the rest of the day  music from video in background starts those sorts of things happen  you get to do sort of nature trips every so often  kay okay can't do anything else today  about thirty seconds of music from the video, some quiet untranscribed comments   audience member asks a question   uhm the year we were in tasiujaq the the the  principal was on sabbatical doing some studies and he felt that  this was one of his projects that year when he was off you know  five or six words   audience member comments   it's a very exciting experience first year teacher laugh  turns into a principal   the north is a mysterious place   now these are people from another village two words  picking berries   that's whatcha what you do in the fall  blueberries and uh word er uh they're   kinda kind of like cranberries red  they're red berries and they're really tart  word these black berries that look like blueberries but they're black  i never found out what the english version of them are  question and answer session with audience untranscribed   yeah  it's always windy  that's one thing it's always windy  graduation  uh she's one of our principals  she's a university grad uhm   and this i'd have to see it again i can't remember what this was but i remember being there   anytime to dance is a great time  we had lots of fun two or three words   laugh word   he's much taller than me now   big guy he's like seven five now   laugh i'm not sure why that one's bundled up like that i think it's in a  well they have these wild party games to play and one of them is  you throw a whole bunch of clothes in the middle of the room and try to get dressed up in as much of it as possible that's one of the laughs with audience   at halloween the trick of halloween i well at least in tasiujaq i'm not sure if this happens in every village but is to get   com so people can't recognize you  so you put on as much stuff as you possibly can  and this is again another dangerous thing that wants to catch these people to musical chairs but everything looks like it's a game you've played before but there's a twist to it that  audience member comments   it's a lot of fun   flags don't last long in the north it's really sad  they get blown to smithereens in no time   just shreds   oh there's a classroom   they're not all like this some have have   word desks  that was marcus laugh   that was marcus 's secondary class i recognize the sweater laugh   that's my husband   this is grade one   grade one   kindergarten   this is the lady who made my parka end music from video 
Canada	 uhm in the interview you can expect up to three  between three and six people interviewing you okay   ah they usually have a pretty even base of men to women okay   uhm usually they have uh the department head or the department coordinator of the english department a couple of teachers and some administrative people either the head of the director of human resources or director of uh the conseil two or three words  or something  anyways they have some sort of administrative people  i never know who they are  uhm the uh the interview is bilingual completely so if you're worried about your french uh you have reason to worry about your french audience laughs nervously   uh is everybody are you all  bilingual audience responds   okay okay inaudible audience comment   pardon me  responds   yeah well i have a really big accent and my french is not perfect uhm   i lost jobs because of my french audience mumbles   you know i've i've lost at least two because of my french  not lost but i i know i didn't get them because of my french  so ah if your french is weaker i'd i  really really suggest taking some sort of french course okay  or going out and getting a french girlfriend or boyfriend  audience laughs   my girlfriend's my my girlfriend's  french now and it's multiple audience members comment   well there you know you can go get a  a separatist or something one or two words  you'll be completely okay audience laughs   so french is really really important  when you get into the interview unfortunately uhm  what they often do is ah you have to write a test audience members overlap with laughing and questions for a few seconds - - conversation and a's speech unclear   you have to write a test  it never ends audience members continued laughter until now   uh ya you have to write a grammar test   audience member makes a comment   no it's no it's english uh it's english  a few words   audience member makes a comment   oh i'll talk about that in a minute   yeah i'll talk about that in a little while   audience member makes a comment   because you do have to do word   but in the actual interview there are usually two  two types of tests that you have to teach  ah to to take okay  the first is usually some sort of grammar test  grammar correction often what they do is give you uh a sample essay from a student and they ask you to correct it okay  as you correct it they don't give you any guidelines you just correct it   or ah another cegep i went to i got a multiple choice fill in the blanks the three words type of thing   it's sounds funny some of them are complicated   the last one i got was uhm uhm   the last job at rene-belanger i did one grammar test   it was i i was very upset at this time because i didn't get a lot of time to write this test in which is one or two words so i did the grammar test very very badly  and it was pretty hard grammar test and i didn't know the rules on a lot of the uh  i m my grammar if you're strong str  you if you're really strong in grammar then you shouldn't have a problem but i'm not   my strength is not grammar   and i missed a lot of them okay  but they they weren't uhm they weren't   typical french cana french canadian   some of these mistakes are mistakes that uhm uhm uh native speakers make  uh i'll give you an example neither he nor i  okay neither he nor i and then they have the verb to be it should be is  or are or am sorry  uh and this is t the type of mistake which is   i was not familiar with the rule and had to go and look it up and i can see some of you going i i are neither him nor i are  or whatever   anyways the whole point is i had to go and look it up afterwards but uhm   so you do have to do some sort of grammar test  i wish i'd brought  i probably have it somewhere if i have it i'd show it to you  but if i don't well i can't audience laugh   uhm   anyways the point is that it's a uh there is  a grammar test  the second thing you have to do is write some sort of essay  okay  the essay is uh usually something like what does it mean to be a cegep teacher or why do you want to teach in cegep audience react  this is a warning too often they ask you this in french or in english so you might have to write a french composition also  okay someone laughs   comments   to be an english teacher two or three words  it's even worse  i'll talk about other things later  asks a question   doesn't matter  comments   okay ah so you have to do grammar okay so yeah  french ability is important  your and the english  grammar test   your the third thing and probably   sigh something i'm gonna going to  mention that seems so obvious but they tell me uh the  interviewers one of the reasons why i got the job   appearance is so important audience react   uhm don't i wouldn't overdress   b uh be you but don't be i mean i mean  i wouldn't wear a tuxedo laugh starts or anything like that laugh ends   ah but at the same time i went to all kinds of interviews with jeans   what i look like now i went to some of my interviews in  most of the time i wear a nice pair of pants and  and just a ah n a nice shirt  appearance is so important  people are so influenced with appearance  and we at that level because they're not looking at you as a   three or four words they're looking at you standing in front of a class and how are these students gonna  going to react to you audience member coughs     and that's really really important  so uhm be really appearance you know it's really important  uh i got so many jobs and so many people told me well  you got the job cos you're clean   and you know and then you start taking people  word interviews but apparently there are t people who don't you know  they     mumbled word   cleaning your nails a simple thing like that can can you can when you've finished eating   so   ah okay the other thing that's so important and you can't change this you can't you can't there's nothing you can do about it but personality   and that's how i got most of my jobs was based on my personality  who how i acted and stuff   uhm the interviews are hard they usually try to make them hard  they they don't usually laugh and they sit and stare at you and   make you feel very uncomfortable  just go in there and kinda kind of smile and even if they're ripping you apart just go word   that's really hah  yes i am very stupid audience laughter   but uh   yeah i'm well   audience member comments   i i i really  it sounds funny but just keep smiling  don't don't get into a conflict situation with them where it's  they like they would like to  turn get you into a conflict situation sometimes   audience member comments   to see how you react and if you react negatively you can just kiss that job goodbye  so you really really you know   either avoid the conflict altogether okay some   some teachers like or just avoid it in very interesting ways   and uh or you know deal with it very very professionally  okay  uhm the other thing they might ask  okay and the last thing about being hired might be uh sex is important  not in terms of having sex but in terms of ah your sex audience members laugh and comment   ah i've been told recently i'm where  i am now there's two teachers myself and another teacher who ah are the last ones in on the the thing  and if everything else is egual equal   she will get the job cos it's a woman okay  so men are at a slight disadvantage  if they have a quota to meet or something it's a hiring of  two teachers and the first one who is already hired and they're  one or two words quota for women or men uhm you could lose the job kay okay so  it usually doesn't affect you  they usually know that ahead of time  but if it comes down t to   y between you and a woman w i mean providing you're not a woman uhm if it's a man and a woman they often choose the woman okay  so that's that is a slight disadvantage  and the unfortunate thing it's a cegep-wide policy which uh i usually agree with cos there's not many female cegep teachers  unfortunately in the language department it's often quite  quite ah there's quite a few women  so it's it should be by department but they do it by cegep  so it's a bonus for women and it's a little bit of a drawback for men   anyways  ah okay clears throat uhm i was going to mention something oh okay no i'll get to that later   contracts   the type of contract you can get   uhm you can get uh sounds of writing on board with chalk  part-time  this chalk i it's like the stuff they give you in uh elementary school for the kids to play with  sounds of writing on board with chalk three or four words  audience mumble and comment   okay uh audience continue mumbling and laughter   part-time and full-time  so there's two kind of contracts there's part-time  full-time  ah full-time is uhm full-time is uh  sounds of writing on board with chalk five courses  okay  and part-time obviously is anything uh less   i'll talk about the everything  else later  asks a question   per term   yeah on   start comic voice if you save your questions to the end i'll answer word end comic voice audience laughter   yeah ah yeah it's it's five per term audience laughter continues   i always wanted to do that  uh a university professor answer audience laughter continues   okay ah the first one is uh it's you can  get it by session okay  which is what i had which is a replacement contract but you can get ah a position which is not a replacement contract  but so you get it by session okay   the second one obviously is by year sounds of writing on board with chalk okay  now if it's uh i i'd rather not talk about the part-time contract  i know this kinda kind of looks bad  but there's probably not that many contracts s'all  it's all full-time okay  the se the session you can work thirty years in a cegep by session getting session contracts   uhm it really is the pits because you'll never get uh you'll never get a sabbatical or uh  your pay raises you're part of the union but you don't get the the  y you never get permanent status kay  okay   about a year is what they call sounds of writing on board with chalk uh word okay which  one or two words post okay  the post you need ah uh you need three posts  sounds of writing on board with chalk to get permanent  sounds of writing on board with chalk   permanent with an e or an a  clarifies   a multiple members correct   e word   as you can tell i'm not a speller audience mumble   i got a really good computer this year with a spellcheck   a few words audience laugh     comments   weak laugh   okay so uh the post is by year   you need three posts in the same cenete  the same cegep to get p uh uh permanent  okay  if you ever get offered a post just take it   it's so hard to get okay  at this point in time they're really hard to get  i'm trying to get a post and it's really really hard okay  three posts you become permanent  the day you become permanent is the day you start dreaming about your sabbatical okay  i think it takes about seven years okay  but if you get this by session you never get a sabbatical   you can work years and years and years and years and never get a sabbatical okay  that's the biggie  that's the big difference between a post and a permanent position  als uh this by sorry by session  also by session you don't know if you're  gonna going to work the next session audience agrees  which is a real pain   because now it's good i have money i'm working it's great and then uh come may i'll be like panicking cos i won't have a job okay  so i gotta got to go out there again and search for it   you get a post it's quite nice there's a good chance you'll get another post okay  these are almost   this these are really good   so if you get a post there's a very very good chance you would  be uhm get another one   audience member asks a question   audience member continues   they don't do that   they w it's a union contract  okay   but some uh some cegeps if they're not sure   if they're sure they'll give you a post   if they're not sure they'll give you contracts  sentence other student uh populations okay  &  audience members comment   what they did uhm my last cegep one teacher was teaching fourteen years by contract okay  and only uh two years ago they gave him a post so   usually i think the rule is that if they have   some cegeps work like this  if they have two people okay and the person like  uhm they're always needing two people the first person will get the post  they'll create a position   and the last person will be th the   sessional person okay  usually that works but not always  it depends on the cegep  depends what kind of cegep that we have   administration in cegep is the pits okay uh  and there is no third one  yeah no no there is no third one okay  so you really want to get a post okay   the uh i brought uh i started making   overheads but i didn't have time so i'm gonna going to  put this on the board   and this is probably everything   but you've all taken education in quebec audience responds  okay no so you've seen the pay scale audience responds  okay right you word okay  anyways i'm just gonnu going to uhm

45 seconds   and once again when you're finished completely let go pause about 5 seconds   placing the left cheek on the mat release the hands close the eyes and breathe pause about 30 seconds   once again make fists with the hands and this time bring them under the body placing the chin on the mat   straighten the elbows pause about 10 seconds   as you inhale gently raise the right leg up behind pause about 5 seconds   and release  exhale bringing the leg down pause about 5 seconds   take a long deep breath   inhaling raise the left leg pause about 5 seconds   and release pause about 10 seconds   breathe deeply pause about 5 seconds   you might think of the word self for the breath slow even long full breaths pause about 5 seconds  adjust the position  this time we're going to raise both legs at the same time   completely exhale press the belly into the mat  inhaling slowly raise both legs 
Canada	 and i als i work at concordia full time as a lab instructor slash technician in biology so  that's why i make concordia jealous  i can recognize a concordia employee after a few leading lines  laughs with audience   so i wanna want to make  what i ususally do in any c p r course is ask everybody involved to introduce themselves and just say as much as they'd like to about why they're here   and that and also you can volunteer any  uh recounting of any experience you may have had calling nine one one or  doing the heimlich manoeuver or heaven forbid doing c p r  which in fact doesn't happen very often  people don't do c p r very often   so between amanda and liz who'd like to start  tape stops and starts again   now i think  i i don't keep track anymore  one of those things  but since the late seventies the very late seventies  and so i've seen trends come and go and different attitudes and whatnot  it i in spite of my ability like many support staff type employees here to bitch about the place it is a credit to the university that they have maintained however   at whatever a reduced level this training for employees  i i've always thought it was a good idea and it's in a way even better that they're doing their own c s s t  comission de la sant&eacute; et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; au travail  training now cough   and the end of the table here we have loralee who is in the process of becoming a c p r instructor tape stops and starts again  did i lose my chalk  i lost my chalk  na na na na na hm hm hm  okay tape stops and starts again   board a sort of outline  something to refer to since you don't have a complete manual  wow look at this chalk   so with the heartsaver if you recall from december ninety-three  what the heartsaver course was about was to help you respond to an emergency situation using c p r and the 'and' is long and drawn out similar techniques   and this type of an emergency is when anybody collapses  the heartsaver focuses on the adult victim and that's  as a responder here this is the ideal cour  the ideal course for someone who is willing to be responsive in this setting   if you were in working in a daycare or something then you would probably take a course that also included paediatric  type emergencies so the h the the  skills you will have to learn will include recognizing writing on chalkboard starts an emergency and being able to assess it and being able to respond writing on chalkboard ends   so these are skills to remember as well as the technique  respond  r e s p o n d  respond  okay  so this is something that i tend to focus on and this you get with the a b cs of c p r  which hopefully ring a bell with you  the techniques writing on chalkboard starts themsleves include the heimlich manoeuver and c p r writing on chalkboard ends   that's pretty well it for the actual techniques you have to learn  but this is the largest part of the course in that it has to be you have to be comfortable with your ability  and willingness to respond to a situation  they go hand in hand  if you're not if you don't feel able then you'll be less willing et cetera   and you might think after three years of no training or something i better not do anything  so the the best response for you always to have is to call for help  so if you're ever willing to do that   if you know remotely how to call for help then that will be an excellent response and something that not that many people are necessarily capable of tape stops and starts again   this is a very simple course designed to train people to be responsive in sudden death types of emergencies or sudden anything type of emergency involving adults   and there are in my mind two important parts to it and the most important part is as far as i'm concerned an ability and willingness to recognize an emergency and assess it and then respond  and of course once you get through recognition assessment and you  wanna want to get into a response then there are a couple techniques that you would do well to feel comfortable doing   especially if you've done this training before the onus is even more on you to assess yourself while you're here today because this is your opportunity to become comfortable and be sure that you understand something that you didn't understand before or that you improve a technique that you learned before  and really it's a very short simple course  the techniques to be learned are variations of the heimlich manoeuver and c p r   a s a single rescuer doing c p r on an adult victim  alright   so what's the backround that's usually gone into involve anatomy and physiology and risk factors for heart attacks and whatnot   but what i like to do right off the bat is to   aside right off the bat end aside is to ask you to try a rescue here   just to see if you remember anything  this isn't laughing in audience this isn't an assessment at all on my part  it's just to get you right away thinking along these lines  is anyone brave enough to uh go through a rescue with me   you're looking at me laugh tape stops and starts again  laughter   i think you must be   hey you read the manual last night  extracorpus speaker makes a comment tape stops and starts again   go up to personnel there and ask them the majority would say that everytime the doors of the emergency room fly open every time they get a call for something they still have that panicky feeling  so accept that and if with my victim and my rescuer here  the word stuff that i want you to be able to think about and try and relate to any situation including the mannequin that i word around here is what do you do if you find someone lying on the floor   she may have just collapsed in front of you or you just may find her like this  and this is this is a horrible thing   you've learned the assessment the a b cs but it's still a horrible thing to ever see someone obviously not doing what you would expect them to do  at concordia you especially at this campus it's such a comfortable campus campus there aren't a great many places to lie around  when you see someone lying down there's probably something wrong  so liz if you could tape stops and starts again   rule number one don't step over the victim laughter   what would be the first thing you would think   extracorpus speaker answers   okay and would you also think of who can help me  comments   i know that whenever at work even if i've seen someone cut themselves even when i myself slice my finger with a pipette i've thought  who can help  how wonderful  so it's go with these natural inclinations   hell call for help get people to help recognize that you're gonna going to panic in the first place and then think a b c   thank you very much  would you carry on  speaker zc begins to speak tape stops and starts again   you would approach the victim but first you should always watch out for what might hurt you  so if the room is full of smoke remove yourself from the victim  firefighters have to go into this and brave death  if the victim is in the water and you can swim and feel confident to rescue the victim lifeguards know this in greater depths as well  but always once you determine that someone has a problem i think  it's it's very normal for people to think that way  you think of saving yourself as well  so you check the environment if you can remove yourself and the victim that's great   if you can't you'll have to remove yourself   because there's no no point in having two victims  so in here this is a benign environment there's no big problem  you can feel free to approach the victim   because she looks so well you would certainly try and wake her up  if you knew her name you might say amanda amanda   extracorpus speaker makes a joke, everyone laughs   and this is where liz mentioned the sternal rub which some instructors are fonder of than i am which consists of grinding your knuckles into the sternum   so remember it's a grinding rub   it's using your bony knuckles against someone's bony sternum and it does hurt  it isn't always required  you only do that when you're not getting when a person doesn't look awful and you think they might be sleeping  when people do look awful they may literally be the colour of the carpet and that will be a big clue to you too  this person looks really abnormal this person must have a serious problem  with the adult victim well with any victim you should yell for help  with the adult victim you are supposed to go and get help  now this maybe something new from the time that you learned this technique   and this is based on the fact that the adult victim will be typically collapsed from a heart problem and will benefit from a defibrillator   so this means when you discover that an adult person is collapsed and unconscious then you are supposed to leave the victim or have someone else call an ambulance  because you want a defibrillator there right away okay  all other victims children and babies you follow through with the a b cs  so if i determine that she's unresponsive i've hollered for help liz and i are rescuing her together   one of us can stay and carry on with the a b cs the other one can go and call for help   if she's unconscious lying here i can rearrange her carefully  the way i need to to rescue her  if i see that something is obviously broken then i would proceed with more caution but i'd still have to intervene if she's unconscious  after the u for unresponsiveness what do we have  speaker z answers question   it's airway   speaker z makes a comment   so then you do the head tilt chin lift like this   and then you wush then you would   do b look listen and feel for breathing  and so each one just involves a little technique  and what you should do today is try and perfect these techniques  and as word said if i discover that the victim isn't breathing i will breathe for her   if i can get the air in then i can move through the assessment to see and check the pulse   and if she has a pulse then i'll just to do mouth to mouth because i know she needs mouth to mouth and if she doesn't have a pulse then i'll go to the chest and do c p r   so what i would like to do now is to just have liz  try and rescue amanda just following the a b cs  if everybody could come around here and watch  and then the next person will rescue liz   and then the next person will rescue that person alright  i want to sort of shock you into doing that sort of stuff right away laughs with audience   speaker z starts to speak tape stops and starts again   you will recognize a problem okay then you will assess the problem and then you will respond to the best of your ability   in terms of any legal considerations the only thing you have to know is that both the quebec civil code and the canadian criminal code have articles that put the onus on any bystander to do something when there's an emergency  this means that if your neighbour's house is on fire the law says you're supposed to do something which usually means call for help  if you hear a neighbour beating up a member in the family the law says both for for the dog and for the wife or the child or whatever the law says you should phone somebody  whatever the the extent of your ability is you should respond  loud noise, maybe a door closing   so as long as you never try and do some emergency procedure that you haven't been trained to do there can be no problem  and as long as it will always be provable that you acted in good faith  perhaps you've heard about this legal consideration agreement from audience acting in good faith  so these these are the things you'll have to consider  that you do respond to the extent of your ability and that your response is in good faith  and then you are literally untouchable by any pursuit 
Canada	 and even though cana canadian uh  canadians often seem to mimic americans' tendencies  canada has not yet caught up with what is recognized as an american inclination to sue   and i really don't know the law at all so i don't know even if it's more difficult to sue here or in the rest of canada  but of course every generalization i make about canada would be modified by something else about quebec  because quebec has a different in many ways a different legal system it has its own tax system et cetera et cetera right  in terms of uh how many people might be around to help you there are in fact not that many people trained  in montreal the percentage of people trained  wi within the population is not quite one percent  one of the best areas i think is the gasp&eacute;   and i have the impression that there there is a lot of training that there's a lot a a a a serious spirit of training with uh c p r instructors in the gasp&eacute;  so there are areas in quebec  the highest percentage in quebec of people trained to do c p r  is two and i think that's in the gasp&eacute;  the lowest is quiet muttering with an extracorpus speaker, unintelligible tape stops and starts again   and so in montreal it isn't even one percent  or it's just scuse me excuse me   no i'm sorry in the eastern townships it isn't even one percent  in montreal it's just over one percent  so it's very important that you have the remotest clue about what to do  another statistic that should compel you or motivate you is that  in virtually eighty percent or eight times out of ten that you are in a position to respond to an emergency you will know the victim  so it will be in your home at your workplace in your backyard  and this is something to consider if you're worried about responding because of communicable diseases like hepatitis or aids  if you compare hepatitis to aids hepatitis is highly contagious  and not as lethal as aids  and of course there are at least a coup a couple of kinds of hepatitis  aids on the other hand is hardly contagious   com as as communicable diseases go aids is very noncontagious but it's very lethal   so whether you're trying to protect yourself from a cold or hepatitis or anything else if you are taking this seriously it's very easy to acquire a pocket mask  and every area that has a responder in the university is supposed to have a pocket mask  if you have any questions about equipment then you should call the safety office and talk to natasha   but for your own self too you can check around and get pocket masks for your own first aid kit  i have one in my car  makes a comment   that's right  there are different kinds you can get there are many many barriers  the manufacturers in recent years have made a killing on barrier production  whereas a decade ago you would have to look high and   far and wide to find a pocket mask for joe public  now joe public can get all kinds of of  barriers  and there there are little ones that are disposable that just come in a sterile package and you tear them open and what it amounts to is a rectangle of plastic with a little piece of uhm   and in if worse comes to worse and you're there feeling uh vulnerable but still interested in responding  then even if you use some some cloth  any kind of fabric can present pre  present somewhat of a barrier not a complete one by any means  alright  does anyone have any questions  so now that liz has rescued amanda i would like  liz to be a victim and i would like each of you to go through the little torture of recognizing an emergency doing the assessment and  okay going as far as you can  so who's next tape stops and starts again   one one thousand two one thousand et cetera  get comfortable with it right away this response this little scenario is the most important part of the course  i will get a two words in you will do the heimlich manoeuver but this assessment and your coughing in audience starts willingness to overcome coughing in audience ends your own confusion and awkwardness is the most important part of the course  starts to ask a question tape stops and starts again   would have been covered in the first c s s t commission de la sant&eacute; et de la securit&eacute; au travail course that you did  you probably learned to disturb the person as little as possible  stabilize them as much as possible that's for physical injuries   always stop the bleeding first  so even if you see this person collapsed here they may have no uh broken legs or limbs or sprains or strains but if you notice an arterial bleed then of course you have to stop that  does anybody remember anything about stopping bleeding tape stops and starts again   christine   christine or christina   extracorpus speaker responds   i have a niece named christine   if i came along here and christine had a big cut in her arm  she may be unconscious she may be unconscious because she is bleeding or she may be unconscious for other reasons but a serious bleed is one where you can see the bleeding   the blood is appearing  you don't have to nobody has to quantify exactly whether it's a spurting gush or anything like that  a serious bleed is where you can see the blood increasing  and the first thing you have to do is try and stop the bleeding  with pressure and elevation right  if there are two of us that would be great if i could sit here with the arm raised putting pressure on the wound  ideally i would have a bandage under my hand but if not this is  helpful  within a few minutes the bleeding can slow at least  it may never depending on where it's cut it may never be completely stopped without some pressure on it but if you slow the bleeding that will help a lot  and for many many whether it's a small bleed or a big bleed there are physiological things that happen to stop it  they the stuff that clots a bleed  if if if the blood keeps spurting out and washing it away then there's no chance for clotting to occur  so that helps too  pressure slows it down elevation makes it harder for the blood to go up against gravity   so that's if you just so you don't  have to have a first aid kit with you to stop a bleed  and you don't have to memorize a first aid course to do that kind of thing   you have to just think i have to slow or stop the bleeding by putting pressure on the wound and raising the member if it involves a leg or an arm  there are some bleeds you can't raise so then you put pressure  okay   so that's the only that's the only first aid you worry about in this approach in this assessment   and if you see broken bones if you see any kind of other damage  the first assessment involves breathing et cetera   so a f a a first a comprehensive first aid approach always involves a primary and secondary survey which was probably mentioned in your first aid course  so the primary survey is always is this person conscious are they breathing do they have a pulse  the secondary survey is do they have a broken foot do they have a broken arm do they have broken ribs  so if you discovered if you couldn't help but notice that there were broken bones you would have to do the primary survey first  and if you discovered that this person needed c p r you would have to do c p r  asks a question   the consequence  this this brings me into a description of death as it involves sudden death   if someone for whatever reason suddenly becomes unconscious  or suddenly and or suddenly stops breathing and or suddenly has no more pulse when they collapse and are breathless and pulseless this is called sudden death  it means that they weren't sick sicker sickest and finally expired  it means that they suddenly collapsed breathless and pulseless  for a few minutes their status is described as being clinically dead   which means that they're not breathing and they have no pulse  that's what clicincal death means no breath no pulse   if someone intervenes either with basic life support or advanced life support artificial breathing and circulation can be provided  and that will stabilize the situation that they're in  and possibly this person can be reanimated and can recover from sudden death  if the person remains clinically dead for a period of time that is with no breathing and no circulation there will be organ and tissue damage   when the brain is damaged enough the death will be irreversible  and this is biological death  brain death is biological death and this is not reversible  and finally if someone who has the authority to do so checks out the victim and says i declare them legally dead this is usually a doctor  then that is legal death  so of course there are people who are dead who are not legally dead  there have been enough cases of people who were not dead to have been declared legally dead  but the only one that involves you is clinical death   and the only assessment you can make following the a b cs is is this person breathing is their heart beating  and so that's all you have to know   that's all you ever have to know  and anyone can check a pulse and anyone can check breathing  and you can and if you do and discover that the person has no pulse and no breath  unless its cause could hurt you too it doesn't matter why they collapsed or how and it doesn't matter how long they've been collapsed as long as you can do the assessment and try to respond   and there's more than just a physical inability to respond that can impede you sometimes  it could be an emotional a mental other type of physical inability exhaustion or something  if ever you're in a position where you are alone to respond  such as with the the the people who sleep on park benches and on a regular basis need attention you just have to do your best  and if your best doesn't involve checking and rubbing his airway then your best should involve calling for help  you know you in the end have to be the person who decides what to do   d'ya did you have a good rest here  laughs with audience   are you ready to rescue somebody tape stops and starts again  walked up to them going no no word  unconscious  to see how clearly people breathe  so trust that  another thing is that if you breathe for someone they won't uh if they don't need your mouth to mouth it won't hurt them  of course if you do c p r and they don't need it it will hurt them  don't worry about giving someone mouth to mouth if you're not a hundred percent sure that they need it  you just have to make sure that you can find a pulse or not and that's why you should try as much as possible to find everybody's pulse here  has anyone not checked everyone answers at once   they didn't do it okay that's it <$ze makes a comment   you haven't  kay okay victim rescuer come on  what a challenge tape stops and starts again   it's a good idea to give just enough air to see the chest rise and not more <$zf asks a question tape stops and starts again  in the initial assessment it has to be very stepwise  tilt the airway check the breathing  if there's no breathing start mouth to mouth with two breaths   once you do get the two breaths in check the pulse  show me how you would do that  asks a question   it is recommended that you check it on your side to avoid pressing down on the windpipe and both carotid arteries 
Canada	" and this pulse check has to be a minimum of five seconds  but in the end you have to be comfortable with what you find  if it takes you fifteen seconds   if she has a pulse that means that you've completed the assessment you've checked for responsiveness called for help opened the airway checked for breathing checked for pulse and the conclusion is that the victim is unconscious and in respiratory arrest  the rescuer will keep the airway open and do mouth to mouth  asks a question tape stops and starts again   as often as you can   not less than every minute  asks a question   yes you can  makes a comment   so i would for instance your position is  is great now and if i were where you are i would   just be holding the head here i would pinch the nose leave  a breath i'd stay here because it loses time to go like this  so i would just stay comfortably here and i would check the pulse count to five leave a breath you know   okay  responds   other things you can look for while you're down this close doing mouth to mouth is a change in colour any kind of movement or noise   anything that looks different stop what you're doing and reassess  so that you will always know exactly what to do no matter who collapses   whether it's your boss or a student or someone having a heart attack because of their bill  i don't know do you see people with accounts to pay laughs with audience   no matter what their age or what the reason if you always know  check for responsiveness  it's a great thing when they're not unconscious cos then you can speak to them  what's your problem laughs with audience   get up get outta out of here  no really when people collapse and they're conscious you should encourage them to stay put  makes a comment   that's right  kay okay   it's great when they're conscious pronounced con-shee-us  and you can do a great rescue job with a conscious person as well as an unconscious person  but with an unconscious person the only thing you find out is by carefully following the a b cs   so how does everybody feel about the a b cs  any better noises from audience   now you'll have to practice on each other again with additions such as what if you think the person has a broken back or what if the person vomits while you're rescuing them  we will do these variations but i just wanted to disturb you initially  right now you can take a break   and then i'll get the mannequin and you can practice on  two words tape stops and starts again   writing on chalkboard starts and remember writing on chalkboard ends   i will always remember the first time i did a c p r course in this room in i think nineteen seventy-nine  with a couple of people with a whore  concordia used to give lots of c p r courses to everybody   and word had a whore in here  there were three instructors roger flatley jamie mccall and me   roger 's in ontariario ontario  now  comments   so roger and jamie decided that they were  gonna going to torture me  and they did  i just walked in here and they said candice is  gonna going to start the course and teach anatomy and physiology and   i died a thousand deaths laughs with audience   and i decided to uh writing on chalkboard starts write on the board small l o g y  i don't spell any better but at the time i wrote like this  brushing noise on the chalkboard writing on chalkboard ends  my hand was shaking so much i drew a curly heart laughs  about this big   but there were like twenty people here taking up that part of the room and the blackboard was over there  and i drew this heart laughs with audience   and i probably drew a bunch of coronary circulations  for all i knew i know i labelled a pacemaker  writing on chalkboard starts i probably did a cross section too and labelled the bundle like this laugh writing on chalkboard ends   and people just sat there going sigh i wanna   want to go home laughs with audience   so now if i ever  and since i recognize completely my lack of artistic ability i rarely draw a heart  but when i do i draw it about this big writing on chalkboard   but i'm not even gonna going to draw one today laughs with audience   i'm just going to say loud noise, something falling on the floor that the heart is about this big  your heart is about the size of your fist and your heart is about the size of your fist   and we can generalize and say that everyone's heart is about  the size of a fist  their own fist  nestled right here in the thoracic cavity the chest cavity  and what you have in your chest cavity which is limited up here by your collar bone kay okay and down here by your diaphragm   you've heard you've heard of this famous diaphragm that helps you breathe and gives you hiccups   well all in here from here to here and from here to here you have lungs  that's it  lungs blood vessels a little few spaces and a heart  nestled between the lungs  and there's a lot of connections between the lungs and the heart   with the the fact that the heart pumps blood through the circulatory system which goes into the lungs to be oxygenated  so there's a big connection here  your lungs are like big sponges from here to here  one thing  i thought of this years ago and i i can hardly ever refrain from saying it  that's why when prople are stabbed or shot their lungs are affected  kay okay even if you miss the heart it can cause serious damage  the lungs they hit the lungs  and the lungs are highly vascular with a lot of very small blood vessels which go through the lungs and pick up oxygen and leave carbon dioxide behind  and carbon monoxide for that matter   or anything else   any other gaseous thing which is mostly carbon dioxide some carbon monoxide and oxygen  and if this connection keeps functioning well then we all just go about our business with our heart beating and breathing away   for the most part people can't control their heartbeat  and cos you do have some control over your breathing you can hold your breath  but in the end it's an involuntary thing  you will breathe  unfortunately there are problems that can arise with one's heart and one's breathing which may lead to your collapse a victim's collapse  and this is when it's good to have a rescuer arrive  it would be great in the province of quebec if the average amount of rescuers in the population were closer to say ten percent than one percent  but in the mean time it might be interesting for you to know that to to to realize that if the room is full of smoke for instance that can compromise your breathing  so if you get out of the room full of smoke if you take the victim out of the room full of smoke that can be a great help  time is often a crucial factor so the longer you stay in a room full of smoke the more likely you are to collapse from it   i think everybody has heard that in a fire in a house on fire in a room on fire what what is the worst thing is the smoke that makes them collapse not the fire that burns them  people don't necessarily get burned in fires and if they do it's long after they've collapsed because of the carbon monoxide from the fire   and other toxic things in the air   so i think everybody can  maybe i'll ask each person if you can  can you tell me one thing off the top of your head that can go wrong with your breathing or your heart  they're interconnected so if something affects your breathing it will affect your heart and vice versa   my example is a house on fire  you have to think of something else  responds   okay  responds   pardon me  repeats   an epileptic seizure can sometimes cause a person to stop breathing depending on the severity or the duration and also any damage they might incur to themselves having the seizure  so that's a possibilty  can you think of one  did you say  responds   an asthma attack  if people have asthma it can compromise their breathing so much that they can't breathe  if someone stops breathing whether it's because of the secondary effects of an epileptic seizure which in itself doesn't necessarily uh cause someone to stop breathing  anything that causes you to stop breathing in the end  if it if the result is too prolonged then you can't breathe  you have to breathe periodically in order to be able to breathe  so once you stop breathing for a few minutes you can't breathe again and so then you're in respiratory arrest  so sure asthma can be life threatening that way  comments   an a an allergic reaction  what what happens is that mucous membranes   and and are most susceptible to a strong allergic reaction   and maybe you've heard the term anaphylactic shock  responds   that type of reaction means that you have such a strong reaction and it involves your airway so that you can't breathe   and people who have serious allergic reactions they often end up having a respiratory arrest from it  asks a question   choking on something is a very common problem and is very easily remied remedied if someone sees you choking and gets up and does the heimlich manoeuver right  if you're choking it means that your airway which consists of your mouth your nose your throat and then these tubes that someone may or may not have described to you at some point that go down into your lungs   your windpipe is here goes down into your lungs branches into  bronchi which branch into bronchioles which branch into alveoli right  the whole idea is that this whole lung area will have as much surface area inside as possible to take the oxygen outta  out of the air that you need  and so if whether it's because something is stopping you from breathing into your mouth or your nose   or rather that or if there is a blockage in your throat   or even if you have something in your lungs that's keeping the oxygen from going from the air into your blood  anything that keeps the oxygen out of your blood will make it impossible for you to breathe  so choking is a common cause  and other things of course are being struck by lightning  trauma uh drug reactions heart attacks strokes  so there are lots of things that can end up affecting either your respiratory or your circulatory system end of tape   clears throat right  so i'm gonna going to start first with something that's not tough which is how to test your camera  right   so the first thing you gotta got to do  is just pretest this the century chart which is for the focus of the lens and see how sharp the lens is and how much leeway you have in its focus   in the uhm being over and under soft focus  and this which is a really bad chart for an example at the university but it's a chart for in french word   in english registration costs  and then on the back is kind of an example of a  frame test which is done to check the ground glass piece in the viewfinder to see if your frame that you're seeing through the viewfinder is the same as the image you're getting on the film  and if it's not you'll either then change the camera  or if you don't have time to do that be able to compensate based on knowing what lens you use at how many feet away   the difference right to left or up and down word  so we'll start with the century chart  the century chart has to be set up straight  you can't do it at could be 'on' an angle like this laughing from audience, people arriving late   no it's could be "" that's"" alright  i'm just starting up  kay okay   the century chart has to be straight so that your plank  to the lens is correct   the idea is to set the camera up at a certain range in which  you can get a clear image of any one of these sections  but you have to have the flat lines in your definition of the frame as well as some of the larger images  then if you're doing a camera test for a production company which generally you do not in the university somewhere in one of the corners of the frame you have to write down the production company that you're working for the camera you're using the lens you're using as well as how many feet away you are at  so that you know all the possible mathematical angles you need to then collect  after that you take a measurement and we'll use eight feet  as the distance from the gate to the shutter   and at eight feet you take a measurement say that's what the distance is  you put your camera at eight feet and you take focus   it should be in focus  if it's not in focus that means it's not calibrated properly  but you film it anyhow  before you film you write on a piece of tape aside starts  obviously not to ruin the chart aside ends eight feet   that way when you watch the film you'll know what the focus is  and if it's soft if it's off if it's completely correct it'll be on the film  the next thing you do is you take that off "
Canada	 so that you know all the possible mathematical angles you need to then collect  after that you take a measurement and we'll use eight feet as the distance from the gate to the shutter   and at eight feet you take a measurement say that's what the distance is  you put your camera at eight feet and you take focus   it should be in focus  if it's not in focus that means it's not calibrated properly but you film it anyhow  before you film you write on a piece of tape aside starts  obviously not to ruin the chart aside ends eight feet   that way when you watch the film you'll know what the focus is  and if it's soft if it's off if it's completely correct it'll be on the film  the next thing you do is you take that off  you readjust your focus so that it's out of focus   at the same position that you were in without moving anything you redo the focus by eye and you write on the chart or on the piece of tape  by eye   that way you can then see on the film the difference between your eye and the measurement  if both of them are exactly the same the lens is calibrated correctly and you're not forced to take measurements on set when you're running out of time  if you know the lens is right you can just do it by eye   but  asks a question   but if your eye's not calibrated then you have to do the measurement  if the measurement's not calibrated you have to do it by eye  hopefully both are   because that way when you have to do any kind of focus pulling  in a dolly shot or in a crane shot you know that you can count on your measurements  otherwise you have to take marks by eye and in no lighting situations it's harder to tell your focus at f two than it is at f sixteen  comments   so if you know that the calibration's correct for both then that leaves it up to you as the camera assistant or the operator to make that decision  comments   but if you know it's not  comments   then you know you're trapped in the situation of either by eye or by measurement loud zipper being done up   preferably by eye because you can trust your eye  comments   yeah  so then after you got those two measurements by eye and then  by the measuring tape the next step is to test the latitude of your focus  so you would then place the eight feet sign back on and  write could be 'right' next to it a plus  and go slightly over the focus so you're at eight and a half feet and film it for about five feet worth of film  then stop put another plus sign  film it again for another five feet   this time maybe at nine feet  knowing that depth of focus is one third two thirds behind you're probably gonna going to have less focus in front of the subject  but let's say that it is in focus then you know you've got a lot of latitude on the slant and it's better in real life situations  then you do it with minus which is the exact opposite and you go to seven and a half feet and then again to seven feet with minus minus  once that's done you've tested the lens and you can put it away  but you have to do that for each lens  the only part where this becomes more work is when you're working with the zoom lens cos you have to test it at different points on the zoom  test it wide which means you're gonna going to  have to move the camera in   do all your measurements at wide  then move the camera back out do it word  the twenty-five thirty-five or fifty millimetres which are common lenses to be used  and then move it back out further  go telephoto and do it at either one hundred or ninety somewhere in there  so that you know that the entire range of the lens and how the opticals are working so that you feel comfortable on set  once that test is done you're finished with your lenses  and then the next test is your registration and  word   asks a question   well what happens with the zoom lens  comments   we you ge only with   the zoom  what happens when you go out right you're gonna  going to have to change your distance for each lens  because what happens is if i'm standing here and i have a wide  ten millimetre lens i'm gonna going to see the whole chart  so i'm not gonna going to be able to test my focus in here  comments   so then i would bring it into the closest point of focal distance that i have  comments   which may be two feet so maybe five feet  comments   and try to get my focus there  and do it so that i have more smaller lines in it so that i can see the clearness of the definition  because that's what tests you definition how sharp the lens is  the lens can be in focus but it could be very dull focus right  and you would prefer to have a sharp focus and a clear image  so the idea being that you would bring it closer depending on what the lens is  but when you're working with a zoom lens what happens is when i'm at twenty-five i could be here  but when i go wide i see the whole room so i have to move it in  but when i go telephoto i can't get focus because it's just too close so i have to move back  comments   well to have as much of a variety of lines and different images in it like small and large  what happens is if you go to word or michel trudel film production facility there they have a tripod that's bolted into the ground with a camera  comments   and it's just a flowing chart on a pulley sytem   and it's got a box in it that lights itself and then you just move the chart with the little rope at the distance you need  wait for it to stop moving do your test and then send it out or bring it in  so that you aren't gonna going to do tests generally at the university you're gonna going to   do them at the rental houses  and they have everything there for you  asks a question   the prime  it depends if i have a fifty millimetre prime i can be  further away and get the image like that  asks a question   well it depends  if i'm a twenty-five mil millimetre lens i have to move closer to fill the screen with the image  and the thirty-five mil millimetre lens it's roughly the same i don't have to move  but if i go to a fifty all i'm gonna going to  get is this  asks a question   well one distance per lens  depending on the lens right  some lenses can be  like twelve and ten are the same  twenty-five twenty-six thirty-five they're the same  fifty is on it's own  seventy-five you're gonna going to have to move back even further  one twenty even further  two hundred you're gonna going to have to be about across the room  comments, asks a question   y you you just  wanna want to take one corner  comments   or in the centre  cos it just repeats itself  the only time you ever hold chart is when you're at a five point nine   comments   which is official and you're not gonna  going to see anything anyhow   even just clean then that's all right  comments   and so that's the uh lens  any other questions chair sliding on the floor   asks a question   that's the problem  you can only get so close right  i mean you can only get three feet  and at three feet i'm gonna going to  have a whole chart  so you get as close as you can   interrupts   yeah yeah  comments   sure  you have to get as close as possible noises of trolley being moved start   like there's only a limited focus you have on that lens  comments   ah depends  see what happens with a five point nine or a fisheyed lens is you need to have more light to have better focus   cos there is one focus point on it   but that like the focus point could be two feet it could be five feet it could be one foot  but depending if you're shooting at an f sixteen  about 12 seconds, due to trolley noises   but the more light you have the better focus you have   the less light you have the further away you're gonna  going to be from the subject of focus noises of trolley being moved end   so we'll do it with  if you can get three or four one k lights right on the chart  you could bring your lens really close and do it  but generally the fisheye the best way to test it is just to look through it  run around the room with it you'll be fine  but because i mean if it's in focus when you're got it and you can see it it's the best you're gonna going to get cos  asks a question   see that's the difference between the university and  outside  in the university three other crews will use your lens and maybe four other crews will use your camera  asks a question   because if you do the test outside of university  right where it really counts   and you're paying two thousand a day for the camera gear  and a hundred and fifty dollars a day for a lens to two hundred dollars a day for a lens  word the right stuff  but if you're the camera technician it's not even your money right  it's someone else's money   right  asks a question   why are you doing the tests here  because if everybody does the test together and you get a report on the equipment and you know what is good with the equipment and what's bad with the equipment  then when you get the camera equipment you can then make reference to the original test and test you do that day and see what's on what's off  and then say well i decide not to use this  or hey marc-pierre word right  but if you go blind because it's your own money coming out of this you have a greater chance of losing  like a friend of mine didn't do a camera test when i was here  he shot it with the eclair type of movie camera   he didn't have the gate adjusted and new black and white film stock came out  it shaved off the first layer of emulsion throughout the entire gate   five thousand dollars worth of film   he spent two weeks shooting  it destroyed an entire film and the university said well he didn't test the equipment sorry  so basically it's for insurance  what happens is on a production outside of the university you do the test you look at it  if everything's okay you give it to the production staff they give it to the insurance company right away  then the insurance can then say to the lab hey something went wrong here but our cameras are okay  so the lab made a mistake you owe us  and one production day is something like forty thousand dollars a day in value  with all the staff all the equipment set design transportation gas actors word   so that's why you do the test  asks a question   well this is the best way to do it  watch their rushes  the last shoot that went out watch their rushes  look at their camera reports  if things are out of focus possibly or one mag keeps scratching and making uhm just any kind of bizarre marks on the film that isn't inherently good  you know ask them  they should have made reports labelled the mags know which one's doing it right  and then you can benefit off their mistakes and have the camera test predone for you  but then again a camera test is usually done twenty-four forty-eight hours before shooting  asks a question   it's done in colour  you don't print the film  asks a question   no you just watch the negative  and it's free  asks a question   yeah you just go over to the lab and say i'd like my camera  test printed  in about two hours they'll print it you go back and you watch it on their projector  and you say thank you you take it and you leave  so i mean it's an hour and a half's work in the industry it pays a hundred and fifty dollars and for you it could save a film 
Canada	 so it's worth doing kay okay   and so like loud laughter from audience you want this one  kay okay   so this here is the fixy thing laughter from audience kay okay and for  the registration test which tests how the film is sitting against the gate kay okay and that the pressure  plates   make sure that its flap   this in my opinion is a really bad example of a registration  chart kay okay   this is my example kay okay which is one line across one line down with a screw right here next to the centre cross  i find it's too many lines and it's too confusing kay  okay   now the idea behind this is you do this test first before doing any of the other tests  what you do is you set up your camera so that it frames  and it doesn't matter what lens you use kay okay   so that it frames this entire chart kay   okay   then you roll fifty feet worth of film kay  okay   and you have to remember that you have to superimpose an image  comments   no but for a hundred and fifty dollars in an hour and a half's work you can go into a black bag and do it in two minutes   really fast  some cameras go in reverse  the cameras that do go in reverse there's a little trick  i'll show you afterwards kay okay   what you do is you try to get this lid for f four then film it at two point eight   the trick is not to put the cross in your viewfinder on this point it's to put it on the dot right after right next   to it  so you're lining up centre frame here okay   and you film for fifty feet  then you go into the black bag and rewind fifty feet of film back  you turn the chart over and you reframe on where the dot is moved to  or the screw usually is what's done kay okay   and shoot another fifty feet and what you get is a superimposition of two sets of lines like this  and this is why i like this better cos there's too many lines  so we'll look at this one  so what you end up with is a superimposition with the xs overlapping at two sets of lines running parallel to each other  what happens then is you watch it  if the lines move in and out of focus or if one line's moving in and out of focus and the other one isn't or if the lines are moving side by side   any kind of pulsation in these lines there's something wrong with the pressure part cos the film isn't sitting flat against the gate  and at that point you go to whatever lab technician if it's the university or if it's panavision or moliflex or michel trudel and you say this camera's no good i'd like to change  kay okay now the only problem is  this test is fine for these cameras like this but the newer cameras  are like the aton the arri s r one two and three the eclair or the arri thirty-five b l which does not look anything like that  it's the same kinda kind of magazines as the s r or the aton and the eclair which is side by side  there the pressure plate is in the magazine which means you have to test each magazine   and you have to do this test for each magazine  but the easier part is there you just open up the magazine in a dark room and rewind the film and then close it again  here you have to open it up you have to unload it   there's a lot more work on these ones  but you only have to do it once   there you have to do it three four five times  and that's how you tell the pressure plate kay  okay   it's a simple test generally done first because you have to rewind  if you have a camera like the arri s which is the small one there which can run in reverse if you have the right motor which i don't have the right motor with us right now  what you can do is you set your mark your counter  at zero you open up the front of the lens take the lens off and you have the gate  in the gate you make an x on the film in the coloured pen  run fifty feet  at the next   where you stop at fifty feet you take the gate off  the lens off again  you make another x  all you gotta have got to do is put the lens on rewind  when you someone walking loudly past microphone get to fifty feet loud door opening and closing you then look for your x by moving it frame by frame  asks a question   in sixteen millimetre  comments   if you're going in reverse  comments   you're going in reverse  comments   with the lens cap on the lens  comments   when you your counter counts back down to about one foot from fifty  comments   then roll and all you're doing is rolling your twenty-four frames which is one foot  comments   till you find your x  asks a question   kay okay what it is is in the gateway the film will look like this   in the gate that's one frame  comments   right  you take a pen and you draw an x  comments   kay okay so what you'll have is an image like this at two points on your film  asks a question   why  because if you've got rewind on your camera you don't have to go into the dark room  you just have to find where fifty feet was  comments   so you rewind by watching the counter go back fifty feet  comments   and stop and look for that x and you just get that x again the starting x  you put the camera in forward  you turn your chart around  comments   and then you just run to fifty feet  and that way you're not wasting film right  cos generally when they do a camera test they give you a short  end of about i dunno don't know eighty ninety feet  and you have to do the whole test on that because they're not   gonna going to give you four hundred feet of film  comments   cos it just costs too much money  they'll just give you old film stock  comments   loud noise starts is that clear  comments   no it's not a problem but it's the fastest way to do it to make sure you're at the right place loud noise ends   comments   kay okay   asks a question   that you can get old film stock for your camera tests  comments   from the last shoot you just did  comments   no the lab won't give it to you but i have cans of old film stock in my trunk from productions i've done before kay  okay   when i go out to a new production i say okay well it's included in my price  and i increase my price for the camera test to include my film stock kay okay   they like it because they don't have to find a short end they have all this brand new film for a feature  and i just go well then i'm gonna going to   do it and in that case twenty dollars whatever  and your camera assistant gets all the short ends   at the end of the production you stack 'em them  up if you need to use 'em them use   'em them   but generally everything under fifty feet is thrown out   if it's in thirty-five then everything under twenty-five gets thrown out of sixteen if it's just there and they're changing  knives   or they'll just run out eh  they'll just run it out of the camera  or throw it out or use it for scratch tests eh  it's scrap   and so this is it's to check your uh ground glass  kay okay   these lines have been put on by someone else  what you do is again you set up your camera with a lens  and you just frame for a chart this size  and there's no lines on it  pretend these aren't here kay okay   and once you have a frame what you do is depending on the aspect ratio you're shooting in whether it's sixteen super sixteen thirty-five there's a piece of glass in the viewpiece that sets up the t v frame and the frame you're filming in the film and that x that you use for the   word test kay okay   so what happens is you've gotta got to  make sure that what you're looking through is the same thing that the gate and the lens are seeing  so this basically forms a game of like running back and forth  but you set up the camera you frame and you look and you find all the lines that mark the t v frame the sixteen frame and the x  and with a piece of tape you run and you l   put it across and you have to go back and make sure that you're right on the line  and once you're on the line then you do the bottom and you keep going back and forth laughter in audience   size  and could be 'then' you do the little x   and once that's done again you write the name of the production company you're working for all the information the name of the film and you film it  now you have to write the lens that you're using and the distance from the lens you're at as well as the camera   once you film that what happens is this   if you see the entire frame on film when you get the camera test back everything's good   if you see half the frame you've got a big problem  if it cuts off any part of the frame it's not calibrated correctly   now what you can do then is either through mathematics and  figs figures like figure out what the shift to right and left or up and down is and then compensate on set or you go to them and say fix it  asks a question   the well here yeah they'll do it and if you're paying thousands of dollars a day they will do it  laughter in audience right  so that's the test  now by knowing this you can get work doing camera tests for people   and make decent money very fast  comments   so so but they don't teach you that here other than me so that's why you know it kay  okay   so once you've done your camera tests we'll move on to the cameras which is the arri s and the b l sixteen mil  millimetre   now these two cameras the b ls are not used anymore   but the arri s is used frequently  the b l is too noisy too heavy and the magazine is just  sigh inconvenient for anything from loading to making scratch tests when watching checking your film  when you're starting your magazine  the arri s is used as a second unit camera because one it's indestructible two it's got a variable speed motor and a twenty-four frame motor  not quartz but it locks at twenty-four frames  and i've done lots of films where we've done two words  like rock videos with this camera and it's been dead on  so it's it works exact it's a   very noisy camera it has absolutely no insulation but it's the exact same mechanism  asks a question   with this motor it runs at twenty-four frames  you can't use  your sound person will have a very hard time trying to get any sound if this is in the room  asks a question   yeah no problem  comments   not a problem  you can do your entire film post like italian style with this camera  comments   i've done rock videos where we've had a c d which is exact time  in playback with this camera and once it's synched up it matches word for word the set  occasionally we'll lose a frame here and there  almost all cameras do   but when you're shooting three to one four to one ratio  at least you're gonna going to have coverage that is gonna going to be in synch at all times right  so it's not a problem  asks a question   which lights  all of them  asks a question   the closest ones  cough that's fine sound of a loud door closing   that's why this is a good camera to know right  and as well this camera only works with bayonet-mount style lenses while this one works with both bayonet and c-mount  which means that you have more flexibility  and what makes it a great camera is that you can be on set you can come with a zoom lens it's a c-mount and be second unit 
Canada	 someone else is working with top of the l   top of the line high speed zeiss lenses with a very good  sixteen or super sixteen camera and you can just say okay well i'll get second unit images and mount their lenses to your camera and run off  and the way it's been designed is to be held like this right  so it's very good for handheld stuff you know  asks a question   you can reserve it for your class projects  comments   kay okay   i've spoken to bob i told him i was showing you this camera and two students ran outta out of here from this morning and booked it for two days each because they liked the flexibility of this camera better than this  this is a good camera without a doubt  it's just that there have been so many modifications to the sixteen mil millimetre synch camera over the last  forty years that i mean there's no point in using this outside of the university  in the university if you're using black and white film or colour films great camera  the lenses are sharp there's no problem it's just you gotta  have got to fight to keep it quiet  asks a question   it's hard to say like i mean there are preferences right  i mean what i've worked with more is arri cameras  so i like arri cameras better  i like the loading system and the mechanisms  but though if the eclair is better for handheld than this camera without a doubt  th this camera is heavy and it's awkward compared to the eclair  asks a question   this one yeah  cos this one can hold a four hundred foot mag  magazine and it can also run on daylight spools  so i mean it's completely flexible  asks a question   on this  this this does have a barney  kay okay which is a jacket for it  comments   the barney does nothing laughter from audience   asks a question   nothing  what really works well for this camera is a down blanket and a leather jacket and two sound blankets over the camera operator and the word   comments   and then you use these clips to to to   keep everything together  then underneath the camera once you've got the camera covered what happens is the sound goes down  and in montreal we have concrete floors and we have hardwood floors  and if you know anything about sound it's very good for  reverb reverberations   which means that the boom operators point the boom down as they're taught in this university to record the sound   they're not only gonna going to get the voice of the actor but they're gonna going to  get the sound of the camera bouncing off the floor and echoing back into the mic  asks a question   what you do is in the crotch of the tripod right underneath the uh screw where you level it put another sound bracket   kay okay   so really what you need is depending on how of an enclosed space right  if you're outside and you're on a telephoto lens you don't need anything  comments   but if you're at this distance and there you're the soundman at a distance of three and a half feet pronounced 'freet'  from my gate he's gonna going to have a heart attack trying to get any kinda kind of sound  and then you're gonna going to be throwing a lot of sound blankets on it  but you've gotta got to remember to put one underneath to prevent the sound from bouncing down kay  okay   and like that it's fine  like that it works well  when i shot with this there was no camera noise but we spent a lot of time in the first four hours of the shoot trying to figure out how to stop the sound loud door opening and closing kay   okay   kay okay now i'll show you the insides of these cameras  the loop on this camera is far easier loud scraping noise  to load than the arri s  but the magazine is the opposite  so i mean they're both similar   kay okay   to open the camera right here by the door the   is where the eyepiece is  this silver knob is turned like that and the door opens   and that's how you lock it kay okay   so you've opened it   this is the inside of the camera like that kay   okay   kay okay   here is your pressure plate and your door   and the pin registration pin sits right there on this little hook  to turn that there's a knob loud noise, something sliding across the floor   to turn it there is this knob kay okay   you push that down and turn and if you watch not only does it move the film through the gate frame by frame but it adjusts the registration pin  in order to load the camera you need to have that pin up   which is just you know you'd see that whether or not i told you  there's no way to get the film in the gate  yeah and the inside of the mag magazine   looks like so kay okay   now to load the mag magazine it's  gotta got to be off the camera  to take it off  this is the only problem i have with this camera is this one design problem  the handle is in the way of the mag  i s suggest that if you are working on a tripod and you're inside and you're not doing handheld  take it off  to take this off you pull forward  it pulls this up unlocks the handle and slides out  that way you have a greater access into the mag  magazine which is just turn this knob and it pulls  a metal sheet out that locks it the mag magazine  and there you go  so the word mag magazine   is   the easiest way to describe it for people to remember and it's the same as that mag magazine for the arri s is you do a nine in and then a mirror image of a nine out  that's what the film looks like  and what you'll see what i mean but that's how you remember it   so it goes in through a hole right here loud noise starts underneath are loud noise ends the white  sprockets   you turn this it tur pulls  the film through  keep it going  right here which there's another little notch that notch tells you   asks a question   it's a stop for the loop kay okay   that's your loop the length of the loop  you then return the film into the mirror hole on the other side and you move the other wheel word   and you have to be precise  otherwise you'll get more noise and the film could break as well   and you might be saying why am i doing it upside down  well in a black bag you're not gonna going to   see what you're doing anyhow   and this is what i mean by a mirror image of the nine   and never forget to put these arms down because that's your footage counter  and clears throat your camera operator and director of photography will send you back into the black bag to put them down cos that's the only way to tell what the footage is  loud scraping along floor starts three words  camera footage loud scraping along floor ends counter on the camera the footage counter here runs the one on the camera  kay okay   the next thing you do is load it in like so kay  okay   you put the back in first push this down and tighten the screw   and don't hold it like that   the next step is to push this in   really there's nothing to show  there's a loop inside the camera   kay okay my loop's too big   asks a question   because it must have slipped when i was trying to get it in and pushed out more film  so that means i have to go back into the black bag   asks a question   when it's touching the ground   no problem background noises and audience talking for about 20 seconds   so this got jammed so i'm gonna going to   use a different mount  asks a question   uhh i think you get three mags magazines    asks a question   each mag can take four hundred  asks a question   it's twelve and a half to thirteen minutes because they always put a little bit of work room on it background noises and audience talking for about 25 seconds   asks a question   what  asks a question   yeah was it the arri three   cos the arri three is one of the last that are being used  asks a question   no last cameras that have magazines  in this model pause about ten seconds   comments   comments   comments   you just have to get used to it pause about ten seconds  asks a question   yeah it's just that if you're not working in a tent which is  i don't know if you've seen those bags  comments   yeah it's just that if you have a university black bag  you have a greater chance of ripping the bag  comments   and then pause about ten seconds   asks a question   nah it depends on the film stock  comments pause about 15 seconds   asks a question   don't have the gate for it  it's a different gate  kay okay   really long and drawn out rrreally frustrated  background noises and audience talking for about 55 seconds   kay okay that's what it looks like   with the with the door shut kay  okay   those mags magazines are jammed uhm but i'll take a look at them and bob and me'll make sure that they're fixed for the time that you gotta got to  start shooting kay okay   asks a question   this is a single mag magazine   asks a question   the arri s  comments   it has a similar mag magazine to the b l  comments   no because the difference is that the b l mag   magazine kay okay has this motor attached to the word   kay okay this is the motor that runs the film through it  the difference between the arri s which again makes it a more flexible camera is that i need three mags magazines   i go get three mags magazines   i only need one motor loud scraping noise because my motor comes off  and so  asks a question   the arri s  the thing is it's actually easier to load because it's a flat surface kay okay   so that's what makes these mags magazines   completely uninterchangeable with the b l   so you can't take three mags magazines  and say well one'll go on the arri the s and one'll go on the b l  kay okay   so with the film in this is what the camera should sound like   and one thing you have to do is get to know what a proper sounding camera is and what a camera that's not running well sounds like   so to start your camera on the pistol grip here is your on and off button kay okay camera starts running  that is what a proper sounding camera is supposed to sound like pause about ten seconds   comments camera stops running   what do you mean it's not running camera starts running  comments camera stops running   it's running at twenty-four frames per second laughter from audience   but it's not picking up properly laughter from audience   comments   yeah  i'm just slightly distracted cos the production i'm working on just called me with a nine one one message so  asks a question   well let me just fix this to show you that the camera is not a complete disaster laughter from audience pause about 10 seconds   camera starts running there  cameras do jam kay okay that's  every camera in the world camera stops running   asks a question   why  asks a question   a power surge  asks a question   yeah the sound  the sound of the camera  but i wasn't listening to it cos i was being paged  but uhm the sound of the camera cos it doesn't have a fluid motion anymore  you hear it in the magazine something happened  for example this is  kay okay i'm gonna show you an example of a jam would be to have the film go in without a pick-up right  you heard what it sounded like clean but this is what it sounds like camera starts running   it just it becomes louder there's a scraping sound and as the film gets full camera stops running   but don't forget your ear's next to the camera at all times  right   that's a jam sound kay okay   that  asks a question   yeah   alright where you can hear that sound   inside the loop looks fine but you have that   comments   but at the same time if you catch it soon enough the film isn't like this like an accordion right  comments   so it's all fine   if you think there's a jam you go into the black bag you open it  comments   it's on this side alright  i cut it so it's not on this side but it's on this side  so all you have to do is wind it cut the film off  re-can it   okay so i'll show you a couple of ways around that without having to use the extra source  cos like i'm saying the extra source isn't ideal especially if you're concerned about sound   uhm we'll get to that in a moment   now clears throat interference on tape begins   word one in this case are one or two words  bars interference on tape ends the synch signal  uhh two and three are what we're concerned about  four there is nothing  d v one d v two refer to digital video  that's a frame grab and i'll show you how to do that kay  okay it's just still in one video in uh one frame  through the video  d v three are colour backgrounds 
Canada	 so over here in setup you have your d v three background okay  so you could uhh  you'll have to put more in that one   comments   uhm anyways usually you'll use the black  and i'll show you  you might wanna want to fade to black  fade out from black  technically you could fade to yellow and out from yellow   uhm here we'll come back to the setup later uhm  okay this is the main thing  your main screen is your first scene  that's your first scene to be edited  the preview represents the beginning of the second scene  in between the first and the second you want a transition  okay  so in this case uh these this is my effects bag a  i've also got effects bag c d e f g   kay okay there's about well there's almost two hundred effects here laughing in audience   uh which is why it can take a while just to figure out what it is you're doing  some of them are really graphic  like here for example watch the screen baaing starts over here  he's got sheep falling from the sky baaing ends  kay okay which is a bit well graphic i mean  comments   some of them do but in any case the sound isn't being transferred  we don't we're not set up for it so you just hear it and uhm  kay okay so this is what you spend a lot of time playing  you just come and and try out some of these effects uhh sound effect in background   that kind of thing  and then you've also got your more   well actually i'm just gonna going to  show you a real cheesy one here laughter from audience   boys have their own of course laughter from audience   and mister clean   they become part of the content of your video okay so  comments   beware  well it's sort of i mean some of this is pretty tacky really  and uh it's really how you use it  there are some more subtle ones here  you've got your wipes uh  your soft wipes and your uhm your  hold on  comments   split screen  now it doesn't digitize it   it doesn't shrink it  although one of them will  i'll show you that in a second  this is good to know about though cos you can shoot for this easily enough   heavy to the left heavy to the right and then combine the two  uhm  so what i'm doing here is i highlight once and i can either  well i can come down here and choose a speed slow medium fast  and then i can trigger the effect by clicking on the effect once again  or i can click on auto   or i can use the t bar  left mouse button and just drag it and just control it and leave it right there   and when an effect is in motion the screen usually distorts in some way or another  and or i could also hit the space bar  you wanna want to hit the space bar  okay so you can trigger it in a f quite a few different ways depending on who you're working with and how you're working  uhm now there are a couple which actually digitize   ah let me just find one  okay this one for example  okay see what it's done  it takes the incoming image uhm as a whole  kay okay it doesn't cut it up or anything  so now i can just like move it around and tuck it anywhere and they can both be removed pause about ten seconds   okay   so you can do this sorta sort of thing  uh there's also a couple that actually superimpose themselves over your image  word snow word  accumulations audience laughter   uhm and then there's also this kind of deep space thing or something audience laughter   and then there is something called the old movie  cos you got rid of your dust and your scratches  in the chrome effects you can combine this with black and white  kay okay so you just take the colour right outta out of your video  asks a question   yeah i'll show you that in a second  yeah they're filters kay okay   uhm anyways this is the sort of thing you come in and play with  dissolve's at the end of every effects bank  so again using the t bar i can just leave it as kind of a transparent superimpose   okay  and i can record that as long as i want to   or i could just take it right out  okay  starts to ask a question   there's also something called the superimpose here which is uhm well anyway i'll  let me just show you  they call it a superimpose  it's more of a luminance keyer which means it'll key a white or a black signal out  okay and i'll show you uhm  asks a question   yeah yeah uh well i'll just show you  asks a question   no you can't set it up quite that way  if i click on dissolve i'll go back here to setup there is the effect speeds  the default is slow medium fast  i can also go to variable though   which means that back here in my dissolve i've got a number grid  so you've got you could have a pretty slow dissolve here  you'd have to experiment with it to get it to that timing  aks a question   you can do  yeah you have to do it manually  yeah   but you can do it on the cut  you would just do it manually  comments   there there there is a system in here a g p i trigger which we did set up at one point but it was just so uh unpredictable that it's better to just do it yourself   uhm kay okay the superimpose  now let's match this up with three  kay okay now you see what's ha   can you see  comments   yeah  uhm i click either on black or white and then this number system here is like a it's a numbered t bar okay  so left mouse button and i'll just scroll   okay so what happens is that the blacks go first and are replaced with another video image you see  uhm and again using this this uh scroll bar i can eventually take it right out if i want  comments   yeah  yeah i can kinda kind of determine the grade of that key  or you can go to white and key out the whites pause about ten seconds   alright  so it has its uses pause about ten seconds   and again this is the sort of thing where if you  if you know about it uhm then you can kinda  kind of shoot with that in mind a bit pause about ten seconds  okay so for example i've got more of a sky here pause about ten seconds   okay that's keyed out pause about ten seconds   alright  anyway   okay so again like all the stuff i'm doing there's little tutorials in the manual as you do everything  it's pretty good that way  uhm alright so the other thing here is the freeze frame   just choose something   the really big thing to remember about the switcher and it can be a bit confusing is that uh when you're when you're  using the editor you're just sorta sort of   concerned with the first scenario that you're editing okay  you cut that and then you're back to finding the other one  uhm in this case you've gotta got to  find scene one and also the beginning of scene two for your other transition between the two  okay so there's another step to it  you've got three end points as opposed to two end points  uhm pause about 12 seconds   kay okay now i'll just frame grab this quickly  it's really pretty simple to frame grab   kay okay let's just say here  uh the freeze button comes up highlit as a default  first thing you do is take it off  whatever you want to grab you'll put in the preview  and uh click on your d vs and press freeze okay  so that's now become uhm a freeze frame and it's stored in d v two  these are also called frame buffers  they're quite temporary  if you start muckin mucking around a little bit chances are you'll lose it  so unless you're gonna going to use it right away you might wanna want to take it to setup and save it to the hard drive and call it back again later on okay  if you wanna want to save stuff to the hard drive generally speaking just ask somebody on staff to take you through how to do that  the manual uhm doesn't really show you like with our system of course so   just let somebody know  uhm i'll just go to save  now i'll find an empty frame   kay okay so let's just call it loud cough in audience word donuts and then save to the hard drive now  so if we lose it we can call it back  and uhm we're going to paint all over this frame is what we're  gonna going to do sneeze in audience  pause about 5 seconds sneeze in audience   okay   now one thing uhm which i talked touched   on just a little bit before there was sometimes on your uh  on your tape you've got two images that you  wanna want to dissolve to and uh i mean you can do a couple of things here  you could make a copy of that tape and use it as another source  or you could for example  alright let's just say this is scene one here  i'll just dissolve to black for example  i'll use that   uhm looks like it's fast  something like that pause about 25 seconds   kay okay are you with me so far   comments   i mean usually this is like a four hour workshop so i'm  moving pretty quickly   alright and then whatever  at any time you fade to black   and that   whenever you're in the recorder as well you're not going to see  the toaster  i can i can click on all kinds of things here kay okay   it's all happening in the player side  this is an output  so once i've got something on my recorder i can't throw a dissolve onto the scene for example  you have to do that as it's being processed through the player  okay  that's something that people sometimes find a little bit hard to get their head around  that is an output only   it's not represented on bus at all pause about 18 seconds   kay okay fade to black uhm  find the next scene  let's say there  and this time i'll fade up from black   so my first scene here is d v three  it's the colour background that's gonna going to  be edited first and i'm gonna going to  dissolve to input two which is the player  okay so you can only see your preview waiting there   kay okay so as soon as it beeped   i i triggered the effect pause about fifteen seconds   okay  so that's one way around it  it's a pretty common device really   uhm and it's a way of keeping your sound organized  there's also the match frame edit uhm which i could show you  what you have to leave a specific time here  comments   yeah  i just wonder if it's it's worth showing you or maybe i can just explain it to you  what i did here was find uh scene one and scene two  in a match frame i would freeze frame the first frame of the second scene set that up here   maybe i should just show you  actually i think that'd make more sense  comments   okay okay i'm gonna going to show you pause about five seconds   somebody tried to speak  okay  uhm alright so we'll never mind this for now and pretend there is not  okay  this one  i'm gonna going to grab this one okay  so could you  does somebody have a pen  they could take note of this  one zero zero forty oh one   muttering from speaker and audience all at once one zero zero forty oh one  forty oh one  alright so i'm gonna going to grab this  okay that's frozen  let's go save this to setup again  in fact i think i'll hold on to that idea   whispering starts i'm gonna going to  close the door  it's really drafty up here whispering ends   kay okay so that's the first frame of scene two   asks a question   it's saving it  asks a question   ah it's the first frame of the second scene   comments laughter from audience  alright so first frame scene two  now let's find first frame scene one 
Canada	 scratch tests are very hard to do on this camera very hard to do because the minute you cut the loop you have to go back into the mag magazine redo it and re set it  with the eclair since it's two different doors you open the door  you pull out the film  you do a scratch test  to do a scratch test you hold the film up like that with a flashlight against the film and you can look at the top plane of the film  if you see any scratches there's a problem  then you turn it over and you do the same  and other than my finger prints from sliding across the film like that which you shouldn't have right before you do the scratch test  question question continues   every time you put a mag on you do a scratch test  question   well you have to go find out what's causing the scratch  question   there could be a little piece of film inside the mag  floating around causing scratches  there could be some fibres in here that are causing the scratches cos there's felt  there's insulation inside these magazines that can break off  there can be rubber  there can be a pace piece of tape   most common thing that happens is on a brand new roll of film   there's a more than a hundred foot word a four hundred feet there's a little piece of tape that keeps it all together and you have to peel that piece of tape off  now sometimes what happens is that tape falls into the mag  causes a big problem  so the best place is to put that tape off the film onto your hand  question   i just put it on my hand cos then i feel it  i know exactly where it is  right  and when i break off a piece of film inside the black bag i never break off anything this size cos then i have to look  agrees   i pull out like that and i break off something like this  and then put it off to the side and i'm going to be able to find something like this  those are  like pieces of film pieces of tape that's what can cause damage  like those are the biggest causes to what can cause a scratch inside  and also a loop too big touching the bottom here  y you know the first place you look is the loop to see where is the loop touching and is it touching anything   all right  question   no no no  if if you're shooting the next day  with the same footage okay and the same from the same film   leave it on  agrees   agrees   agrees   there's no need to uh recan  question   no you change your camera report to the next day  agrees   you don't change the mag  the mag's fine   ya  and now   question   ya you unload the exposed film  you basically put this in a can   okay   then attach this   and again and uh serve your camera word  you don't need to uh  uhm d depends like   what happens is if you're   a lot of times if you're travelling on a film set you're   gonna going to take apart your camera for safety reasons  so you're gonna going to take the mag  off the f film cam  camera off the film camera  anyhow and put it in its box  so you've unloaded it   and you're usually going to disassemble the camera   rarely do they keep it in tact   mostly when you work on a documentary and you're jumping in and out of a car the camera operator will hold the camera and the rest of the technicians will take what's needed and what's called a diddy bag which is the bag and run back and forth short exchange between za and a, not part of demonstration   now the difference between mags in this one is that  there you have to uh get it into the perforations and move it along  this there's nothing   y you don't need to make a loop  you just put the film in in the same formation   and word loop goes in here   well again it's the same system where you take the film   question short question/answer between zb and a   the mechanism that drives the camera is the same for both  as well as you know they came out at the same time  the were used for similar things  one was used for sound and one was used for just images but they were designed and built in and around the same time and modified  together  so really it's the lenses  if you put on the newest lenses of which you can on this camera you're going to have a very nice defined image  question   ya but i me mean if you're doing uh stock footage or special effects or slow motion  cos the beauty of this camera is that this is your motor right here   okay  the other motor is what controls the speed  so the other motor which i don't have with me is what creates a variable speed camera  you replace it and you just turn it from right to left   and here is a counter   question   ya  question   well what happens is it goes from zero to fifty all right which means that you're going basically a stop over or a stop under  with the film stocks that exist now with a latitude of three stops over and under and being able to correct the overexposed film in the lab  you don't have to worry about it at all  question   like the vision five hundred and the vision three-twenty  question   kodak   question   it's not the best  what it is is it's a very high-speed film with very low grain  in comparison to the regular five hundred a s a  so you can shoot at night with very low light to just ambient light that exists  question   it's called the vision five hundred   answer   it's a gold camera audience discusses film stocks   so you put the mag on  then you lock it  like that   and then you put the mag secure   question question   question   no this is just for security   agrees   this here it this toggle switch locks the mag in  agrees   question   you make the loop once you're inside  phrase   okay   okay   and then you just lock it  and then camera's secure  so you put this on just for safety because it might get bumped   cos this is the side your head's on   all right  so it can get bumped  so here again you open it up   to control the pin this time is with this  you turn it here on the motor and it moves the pin up and down   okay   frame by frame   all right  so what you do   i'm going to do this quickly and then i'm going to go make a phone call  is you press this button down  this allows you to be able to move in and out around here with your film  you then   no  phrase   ya   agrees agrees   so that you can see this clearly   okay   it's very simple   here there's a white line and here there's a white line   these two white lines that's your loop   that's the marker  what it is you pull the film forward like that   slide it in  so this is upside  no i'm s i'm looking at it upside down  it's right   okay  make the top of the loop   and   question   ya   it's hard two or three words to see what you're doing  there  there  you see it  i shut my door   okay   then i go and i make the bottom of my loop like so  question   ya short discussion among extra-corpus speakers   and then my film's loaded   like that  i just pick this up  tighten it before shooting   'kay okay now the trick this camera also jams and stalls  everything that can go wrong this camera will do without a doubt  question   no i just have to give this a  question   fits in like that   'kay okay   question     no no  this is the motor that drives the camera  this is the motor that drives the magazine  when you're using a hundred foot daylight spool which is on the  black   i don't know where on word   this is on these  okay   comment   comment   you don't need the magazine   all you do is where the mag pole is you put this in  agrees </o  okay  only problem is every time i've used one of these the cameras jam  if you have a daylight spool you can put it here   take out the black or put it here  pick it up on a core  it prevents from jamming   you know  and then you can do the whole thing outside   question   clarifies question   more question   this black one   this one   it can come out  agrees   if you lose it it's two hundred and fifty dollars  agrees   you have to make sure it goes back   and the lab won't return it  there's a little black market that's been going on     question   ya   it it can come out very easily  but at that time everything's word   okay  so basically your loop's done  you must tighten these otherwise they will break because  it's just a surge of power  cos this camera starts right away up at speed   a few words with these   and it shows the arrow of direction of which way it's supposed to turn   that's it  okay   and you can use a hundred foot spools and you can even use a hundred foot on core   right  you just take the black inside part of the core and you put it there and it'll pull your core so you get your twenty feet if that's what you have  just load it in a black bag   all right   and then for it to run it's on this battery   the thing about shooting with the hundred foot and the four hundred foot is because the hundred foot only uses one motor and the four hundred foot uses two motors  question   no you need more power but it's in one battery  and to prevent your camera from uhm you know the film breaking running too slow not going at the right speed when you're using just the arri s without the four hundred foot mag you must turn your battery on to eight volts  there's a switch  this battery belt doesn't have the switch so i can't show you the switch  okay     question   question continued   the arri s   one hundred foot roll in the camera which is  basic what what is called camera no i d which means there's no mag   question   to eight volts to prevent damage inside the camera cos you can brown out the battery  there's too much power going in  and then when it's running with the magazine you film it you put the power on to twelve volts or fourteen whatever the other one is  there's i can't remember it right now  and that's to run both motors with enough power   this one's already at that permanently and i think there's only one belt here that has the switch to go back and forth  okay  so you know this there's a plus   one is plus and one is obviously minus one  there isn't anything  red on the battery belt is always plus   okay   and that it runs like this audience response to camera noise   but i mean it's also open  it's usually quieter  comment   you can really hear your money go by  question   fourteen volt battery  question   no  okay this is what it sounds like  b this is your line   it's on but it's off   ya  question   that   question   i think they're paid enough not to  laugh i don't know  i've never asked them this  i really don't speak to the actors  it's not my role when i'm working the camera   there's a very high hierarchy  it's just not my role  i mean the cam camera   the actors might ask me uh what lens i might have and that's about it  that's my communication  i'll say move to the right more to the left  i don't know how it effects their psyche  well it's done the job  ya  it is loud but a lot of times you're with a very long lens far away  like one thing you can do with this camera is put a hundred and twenty mil millimeter lens   go real far away  get a nice wide to mid shot while this camera is doing a close up and run in sync   question   there is no book design for this  what happens is there's no insulation in the camera because it wasn't designed right for that but you can try to make your own  word for it with blankets 
Canada	 i mean you can do the same technique of sound blankets if this is on a tripod as you can with that  only this has got a head start   right  but okay take a five minute break  i'm going to go call this guy and then i shall return  tape cuts out audience members laughing and talking   okay so now that's how you load  when we're done you guys can play with mags try loading it but there's more you got  so the next thing to do is to adjust your eye piece to your eye  the viewfinder  there's two people who need to have the viewfinder adjusted the camera operator and the camera assistant  question   comment   director doesn't have to see the focus  there's usually video assist and they'll see it through that  the reason why the camera assistant and the camera operator the camera operator will see the frame get the shot but once the shot's going  the shutter moving in front of his eye causes everything to be slightly soft anyhow   'kay okay   and so they can't tell if you're in focus or not if you're the camera assistant  they can tell if you're dramatically out of focus   all right  but they can't tell if you're slightly softer focus or if you're sharp  so that's why you need to be word in your focus cos it's your job as the camera assistant to get the focus  so what i did on this camera is i showed a way to set the eye pieces  and i'll show you in detail how you get your eye piece  but what you do is you find a mark as a guide mark  and then you find focus and you put another piece of tape and that's yours  and then you put the camera operator or the camera assistant in another colour  and don't knock this because if you knock it then you have to fight to open it and move it  and the camera operator never wants to have it out of focus his  eye piece  hopefully he has the same eyes  there's a lot of latitude in that for the focus  but if you're the camera assistant and you've just taken some marks and now you've gone back you you're done and it's for the camera operator you must put it back to the camera operator's eye  cos if the camera operator starts looking goes everything's out of focus check your focus check the focus and you go my focus is fine  and you go my focus is fine  and then you go whoops sorry they're gonna   going to be like hey come on we just lost some time panicking about the image let's work here  the next thing you have to do once you get the focus done is you as a camera assistant must show up on set with these  these are cushions for the eye piece  'kay okay if you don't show up on set with these it's like a big sign of disrespect to your camera operator  the production should pay for them   they cost five dollars apiece  i have some left over from another production that you know i've kept with me in case the next production i go on doesn't have them  the reason why you have them is that eye piece is plastic  for one you sweat in a hot room   if you're in that eye piece for sixteen hours a day for four weeks you're gonna going to have a ring of acne and infection   laugh   this you change every day   the next thing is if it's cold out and you sweat your eye then freezes to the plastic audience laughter starts   and so what happens now is they've actually got  audience laughter stops you put this on and then they've got an electric heater inside the eye piece now that when it's cold you plug into the camera  and it starts to heat the eye piece   but the plastic will still burn the skin all right from the cold cos it'll freeze so you have to have this on as well  question   this you can buy at panavision moliflex michel trudel  wherever you get camera equipment  question   ya you take off the lens and you aim to the brightest light source  if you don't have one the camera assistant and the camera operator trade back and forth shine a flashlight into the gate  warn the person looking through that it's going to happen cos it could cause retina burn and then adjust the eye piece accordingly  the way you test is go completely out of focus for your eye and move into focus on the grid inside the eye piece  once that's sharp pass it then you turn backwards and you'll get focused for your eye piece  mark it then let the other person do the same  short, off-topic exchange with a new speaker   that's the same for every camera   okay it's the same mechanism on this this the new ones out   it's the same thing  so then you move to the lenses cough   for this camera to load the lenses is very simple  up here is a little tooth  i don't know if you can see it   a little tooth inside audience murmurs on the top  audience murmurs   okay   'kay okay what you do with that  is there's a hole so male female and you enter audience murmurs  and that's it  the lens is installed   'kay okay   now the thing with this is that you could put three lenses on   i suggest that if don't need your lenses on make sure the caps are on even though it is sealed inside  it's just better protection   so   question   okay there's  th there's three ways i've seen the gate being checked  two of them are correct  one is from first-year and second-year students who don't know how which is to take the door off and look in which is you lose film  to check the gate it's the same way to move the registration pin  okay  it moves the shutter and the pin at the same time   okay  now there's two ways to check the gate   one is to press down on these two buttons here that are all the way around  each one is it it   loosens the lock  slide it out   move the uh shutter so that you can see the film and there's your film inside maybe three words   okay  and you can check the gate with a magnifying glass and flashlight  there's another way to check the gate and i use this one because it's easier to see   question   hair dirt dust  but what happens is when you take the lens off frequently you actually allowing dust in  so the fastest and best way to check the gate without a magnifying glass is to use the magnifying glass which the lens is   so you open the lens up all the way   focus at infinity f-stop here t eight and then   i don't know  i doubt you can see it but if you look at the right angle with the flashlight you will actually see a magnified version of the plane of the film  and then if you work around each corner you can see if there's any dirt in the film  you don't have to take anything off the camera   you save time and you don't allow dust in  question   statement   it's more accurate   be because well you  because you need a magnifying glass to see a sixteen mil  millimetre frame  there's stuff that can be there that you might not see   like this  if i   question   no you look in the lens   and it's word a magnifying glass and i can see the entire mechanism perfectly  and i can see now the felt already ripping through   i mean pulled down  and i would have to clean that out before i continued to shoot  question   if you look in look at the very top  can you see the top of the film  agrees   'kay okay   do you see how there's little pieces of fabric at the top  agrees   there are  trust me audience laughter   well you have to hold the flashlight yourself  don't look at the glass  look past the pane of glass in and you'll see the film   the big orange   agrees agrees   do you see it as a little word at the top  $zd> agrees   there you go audience laughter   a few words   you have to clean these out  question   ya with the word stick  question   ya   question   you clean it   question   ya then you have to take the lens off   question   no no no  understands   take the lens off  you clean it with this  question   word and with this   question   no  first you do   is if   okay if this is the gate word example  'kay okay the dirt that's there is actually the felt that's inside the camera where the film comes through like that   and it's cos it's an old camera it's bringing in fabric after running it for a while  what you have to do is you take this and you just clean off  all the way around the gate  blow to make sure the dust gets out  run it again  if it reappears then you take it out and you clean it out  take apart your camera again and clean it off     question   no  here and here   okay   so that's how to check the gate in the fastest way  you can you can take a look when  you're done  questions   pardon  rephrase question more question    ya all cameras that would   that's the best way to check the gate  the only problem is some zoom lenses the opening to the gate is so small and there's so many layers of glass to magnify down  that you can't see anything no matter how hard you try  but with the prime lenses it's very simple to see  it's easy it's fast and it's clean   okay  mumbled phrase   okay so that's how you load the  a few words lenses  that's how you load the lenses on this camera  if you wanna want to try go ahead  no what makes this audience murmuring a couple words complicated is the they way that a few words   question   just so you know that's a mag-lite  pronounced mack-lite   question   it's a mag-lite   if anybody asks you on a set for the mag-lite  that's what they're referring to audience discussion of flashlights   'kay okay to look to take the lens off on this the first thing you have to do is loosen   'kay okay   here this outside ring you have to loosen it and it says in which direction  it says loose and fixed    all right   okay  there's no pressure in these   once it's turned it's turned and it's locked  so you loosen it  the next step is to take the lens out   you can't do it on the table so i'm gonna going to do it here but i'm going to show you what i'm going to be doing  i'm gonna going to be pressing this silver button here  okay  this silver button here unlocks the teeth that hold onto the bayonet mount inside  it's a different type of lens   okay  so all you do is press this and it's out  okay  it's a bayonet   'kay okay   you gotta have got to get used to a lot of military terms  for some reason that 's come into film but magazines bayonets   okay and to put it in it's the same thing  you lock and you close this ring   and you're done and the lens is in  it's tight  there's no problem  okay  that's how you load the lens in  now if you're using prime lenses on this all you have to do is take the prime lens out  put it into a new blimp which looks like   but never leave the case by the way   no   question   that's not the lens  that's a blimp to prevent sound  never leave the case on set or anywhere unlocked or you will be kicked off set  all right  there's just something   all you need to do is lock one of them but don't leave them unlocked unless it's open   here  this is the blimp   it's to prevent sound  this one doesn't work because there isn't a ground glass which is a clean piece of glass to send the sound back into the camera  but you can always take the ground glass from this one and put it in here  'kay okay   take the ground glass off and turn this knob  again it says where and how to open it 
Canada	 start there  start with the presumption that even though mick has been charged with a criminal offence he sits before you an innocent man   he is a big man but an innocent man  indeed he has continued to be an innocent man throughout the whole course of this proceeding  and ladies and gentlemen he will remain an innocent man unless the prosecution mister rawls can prove or has proven to each and every one of you that mick millner is guilty of the offences that he has been charged with guilty of those offences beyond a reasonable doubt   remember that mick millner does not have to prove his innocence   he does not have to prove a single thing to you  you ladies and gentlemen by the same token don't have to do a thing  you don't have to solve the mystery   the prosecution must do all of the work and they must not simply as mister phelan put it tip the scales in their favour  where you see what does it take here to make mick millner do everything  and in word do not take away someone's liberty by suspicion or by speculation or by simply tipping the scale in their favour  the crown prosecutor has then every responsibility to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt  if after careful consideration of the evidence ladies and gentlemen  all of the evidence both that of the crown and that of the defence  if you are not sure then you must acquit my client of these charges  if you have a reasonable doubt you must acquit mister mick millner of these charges   now ladies and gentlemen some of the things that i may say to you over the next period of time will be things that perhaps mister phelan and mister barker touched on already  there is no way to get around it  it's one of the problems that's going to surface  but those things are important to my client  in addition to that there are other things that i would like to bring to your attention   let me begin by saying ladies and gentlemen that the crown has paraded before you fifteen witnesses   of those fifteen witnesses three were police officers  there was doctor rolston and word  piney the owner of riley's   those five people the police officers mister piney and doctor rolston were not eyewitnesses to what occurred that evening  the remaining ten were eyewitnesses to portions of whatever happened on the night of november the thirty-first nineteen ninety-two  of these ten seven of them had consumed alcohol in varying quantities to which would make them intoxicated to any varying degrees   only fred avalon ronald craw and mike treadle had either had nothing to drink or had very little to drink   recall the witnesses comments all of them  these people were partying  they were having a good time  there was ah free beer  there was glasses and pitchers at their table  they had a glazed look  they were staggering   a couple of them went to the automated teller machine for more money   note the way mister treadle described his friends  he said and i believe i took this down they'd been there for awhile drinking quote continues   mister craw another friend says i meet charles  fifteen minutes before i left and he was drunk   now ladies and gentlemen i'm not here to uh create evidence for you and i do make mistakes when i write things down but i do believe that those were comments that i wrote down verbatim from the witnesses  even these people these seven people admit they were drunk  glen hawker a few words   lister said ron lister i was feeling pretty happy   colleen paska i had quite a bit to drink over the whole evening   anne kramer i had five vodka specials in two hours    wanda wishaw a few words   and mister montebank mister charles montebank   i was feeling really good   don't for one minute ladies and gentlemen believe what mister  raoul eto said a few words that he was just joyful that he was two words   these individuals were intoxicated albeit to varying degrees  even mister mike treadle 's evidence i sug  i suggest is somewhat doubtful not so much because mister treadle i i think was intoxicated but because mister mister treadle doesn't give a lot of evidence about much and the evidence that he does give the actual  eye ev eye witness testimony that he does give  he gives at a point in time where he's upset  as mister avalon describes it he was frantic   he word   bear that in mind as well ladies and gentlemen of the jury when you consider what mister treadle had to say  i submit to you that the crown's strongest witnesses were two mister fred avalon and mister ron craw   together when you take just their testimonies together you have an explanation of what happened right from the fight at the washroom until  everyone's arrested at the end of the evening   the only thing that mister avalon can't testify to is what  mick millner was doing out on granada avenue but ron craw can a few words   and these two witnesses they have no connection maybe two words   mister craw doesn't know any raoul eto doesn't know mick millner   mister avalon he had a connection at one point in time  he worked there word but word  did not work there for a long period of time  mister avalon has no reason no reason whatsoever i suggest to you to say anything on behalf of these individuals because he has a vested interest in them a few words   nothing   nothing at all  ladies and gentlemen don't be fooled word   the crown is going to stand up and is going to say to you i believe is going to say to you that the evidence of these seven people and their testimony coupled with that of these other witnesses that i feel are stronger proves beyond a reasonable doubt that mick millner  committed the charges uh the the  crimes that he has been charged with   but i hope you understand what the witnesses are saying not only contradict each other but contradict what the  maybe two words   a few words   the crown wants you to believe the evidence of these people  over the evidence of four sober people  never mind that they're the accused  they're asking you to believe the evidence of those people over four sober people  that doesn't make any sense to me  as mister phelan pointed out you don't have to be an expert to explain the effects of alcohol  i'm sure that all of us at one point or another in our lives have seen someone who was intoxicated  maybe we've had a friend who's been drunk   word i suggest to a few words  perhaps you have had a friend that's been intoxicated and think about some of the things they ask you the next day when you see them again  they say where were we last night   what did what did i do  what did i say  did i embarrass myself  did i embarrass you  you know these are things that that uh a person who is intoxicated uh will have questions about the next day  well what does that show  it shows that to a certain extent and again a few words  but to a certain extent alcohol will cloud a person's memory  and effect their recall  there's no question of that   ladies and gentlemen the crown's evidence that they are trying to or that they are entering before you is just that it's evidence of seven key witnesses that's tainted by alcohol   ask yourself this question who is going to have a better recollection a clearer recollection of past events someone who was sober at the time or someone who was drunk   i think the answer to that question is obvious   now don't get me wrong  i'm not saying that the witnesses are lying  i'm not saying that by any stretch of the imagination  i'm simply saying that they are confused  their memories are cloudy   they're confused about the sequence of events  maybe they're confused about who they saw doing what   and to a certain extent on some occasions they are confused as to who was actually word   let's examine the evidence now ladies and gentlemen  i like mister barker 's four scenarios   situations but since i'm defending mick millner i have to add a fifth one  let me say to you that it it seems to me that there are five areas  the first one is the washroom   the second one is the coat check area   the third one is granada avenue   the fourth one is ninety-third street   i have to discuss that because there's been an allegation that  mick did something on ninety-third street  and finally the hallway incident   let's start with that washroom incident   who actually saw what went on in there   think about that when you're analyzing the whole situation   the washroom incident raoul eto he says he got hit in the side of the head  he got a couple more blows  he doesn't know who hit him   ron lister who's sitting right there at the table the table above the area where this fight was was  uh taking place he's watching the whole thing what he says is all big guys uh all the big guys did was pull everyone apart and take them to the coat check   that's all they did   anne kramer she was sitting off to the side a little a little ways away  maybe three words bar and one guy went after raoul   raoul and this guy went at him   wanda wishaw said raoul threw one guy up against the railing  neither guy threw any punches   and ron craw said mick he saw mick run in but he couldn't see much because there were people in the way  and that's really all that he saw   but these other four people  you'll note of these other four people not one not one of those people said that any of these big guys or any of the barmen or any of the accused hit mister raoul eto not one   now we know from the testimony right it appears from the evidence in the testimony that mister eto was bleeding at this point in time either from his mouth or his ear   there's nothing word   someone hit him   who who hit him  well it's very possible that he hit him   according to the testimony that i just read just a few portions  three or four words was one of the other questions    mister millner was not involved at this point in time  now from the coat or from  from the washroom area to the coat check area most people think nothing happened   mister eto was whisked away  and i believe the evidence of the accused is that it was mister uh  wasylesko mister frank wasylesko and mister johnny steen took him to the coat check and then mick followed them up  but there are two ladies anne kramer and wanda wishaw who say that something happened in that hallway  they say that someone hit raoul eto right in front of their table down there on the word down on the  word   and i believe one of them indicated that they thought that it was  mick millner or i d'd mick millner as the fellow that had him there although that particular lady couldn't say whether or not  two words   i suggest to you that what that lady  what those two ladies </} saw actually did take place but it di dn't take place right there in the hallway  it took place up at the coat check area   these ladies were sitting there  they were looking down the hallway  they said they could see it   that's where they saw it  that's where that happened  that's where they saw mister eto get into an altercation  with my client at the coat check area  so there's just one example of how what they're saying may not be  or uh i'm not saying that it's not correct but i'm saying that they're mistaking as to where exactly that happened   i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that occurred at the coat check area   now mister millner didn't have any reason whatsoever to hit mister eto at that point  none whatsoever  he didn't have any reason at all  nothing to do with it  when he got to the situation everything was under control   but at the coat check area he word   my client got up on the stand and told you what happened at the coat check area   and when you when you contrast what my client had to say about what happened at the coat check area with what the witnesses say well a again  i'm confused 
Canada	 raoul eto said he has no idea what happened at that coat check area and this is an area where someone punched him   someone actually punched him and he doesn't remember   charles says he went up to ask   he got hit in the head and he got escorted out   glen hawker said he went up to talk to mick   he got pushed up against the wall and punched but he can't say what happened next   and ron lister said he sees mick grab glen  but he is in a choke hold  despite this he still sees what happens to glen but he doesn't see anything else  he doesn't see what happened to raoul eto   colleen doesn't remember anything  mike didn't see anything   don craw didn't see anything   and dawn kramer and wanda wisha well they don't really word   they didn't get up maybe three words   what i suggest to you is what they saw is what i already explained  they did see something going on there with mister millner   mister avalon says he came out of the office albeit the skirmish was already well under way and he testifies to what he saw albeit he is not a hundred percent positive of who he saw word   because if you'll recall he couldn't say that mick millner  was down on the floor with raoul eto but mick by his own admission said that   and word you saw mister raoul eto a fairly large man   what i can't understand or what confuses me here is how  none of these people could see what was going on there right in front of them right there on the floor in the coat check area  all of these people charles glen ronald   word they can't word   after hearing what my client had to say i asked myself  a couple words if he was going to fabricate a story at this point in time he he knows what these other witnesses witnesses are saying  none of them can say he did anything  if he was going to fabricate a story why wouldn't he stay out of trouble if no one else was going to word   why wouldn't he say i didn't do it but he does  he does because he's not that two words   now my client readily admits that he punched mister  eto but he did not punch him word you'll recall his testimony until mister eto had started struggling  word   and the reason he punched mister eto is because mister  eto was trying to two words trying to injure him word   and my client was very animated   he said i punched him once quote continues  and i suggest to you that that's a few words   you know that the officer when he examined my client's hand with the word later that evening found a nick there  well that nick was from mister eto   that nick was from my client putting mister eto in a  word   now when mister eto left when he was escorted out he wasn't two or three words   and i suggest to you that that's the reason two words  my client hit him  my client only hit him three words   one of the other reasons why my client word   o one of the other reasons why the  initial altercation at the coat check three or four words  is because mister raoul eto before anything else was done reached up and grabbed my client by the collar and tore off his gold chain   he tore off the gold chain that my client was wearing and he left a mark on my client's neck  and i put his mother on the stand   she saw him the very next day  she said his mother testified that he had this mark  i tendered the gold chain as a an  exhibit and the reason i did that is because i want you people to go back to that jury room to have a look at that gold chain  look how thick that gold chain is  it's not a word   imagine what type of a force was necessary to yank that off of someone's neck   he yanked it off hard enough that it left two words  so what my client is saying about that being the  action that started the whole incident what do you think   raoul eto reached up grabbed him by the collar breaks his chain he put mister eto in a headlock  at that same time mister glen hawker came up to him by himself   and mister hawker said   word walks in and said maybe two words or just happened what's going on   mister millner came in said do you want a piece of it too and pushed him up against the wall and he punched him   well ladies and gentlemen let me ask you this first of all if indeed mister mick millner did say do you want a piece of it too why would he push him up against the wall and strike him  mister hawker has given no response to that  mister hawker hasn't come at my client according to mister hawker   so why would my client do that  my client is merely if indeed he did ask that is asking a question  he says do you want a piece of this too   i suggest to you that mister hawker must have done something he must have done something to my client to facilitate my client grabbing him and pushing him up against the wall   and do you know what he did i suggest to you i suggest  two words that he grabbed my client by the shoulder and he grabbed my client to get him to let go of his friend raoul eto   and it's at that point in time mister millner  three words   let me also put to you ladies and gentlemen he has mister raoul eto in one hand he has mister glen hawker up against the wall in the other hand and then he's supposed to pull back  and hit mister hawker   ladies and gentlemen that would to me seem to be very difficult  let me also point this out to you  mister hawker had a cut above his eye  that's all he had  no stitches   no black eye   no bruising   just a cut  and he couldn't get a hospital to treat him  about three words   that's word   that was it   i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that what indeed happened  to mister hawker was he grabbed my client by the shoulder  my client pushed him up against the wall   a few words because he didn't know at that point in time exactly what mister hawker was going to do  and then at that very same moment mister montebank  came crashing in and my client about three words   he let go of uh mister hawker up against the wall  and i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that whatever injury mister hawker suffered two words got cut he  suffered after my client let go of him   there isn't word any maybe four words   mister hawker any number of them could have cut him but my client was not one of them   my client denies three words   and i think ladies and gentlemen when you look at that  two words   bear in mind that when my client grabbed him he didn't have any intention to injure him  mick said i woul would  i pla pushed   him up against the wall   there is no indication in the testimony that mick millner  intended in any way shape or form to injure mister uh hawker    uhh how about granada avenue  let's go to that thing   there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever from any of the witnesses that mick millner had anything to do with raoul eto  out on granada avenue   the crown's witnesses say they they  didn't two words   out on granada avenue that skirmish that was going on back there mick millner was not a part of it   i spent a lot of time in cross examination going over the witnesses where mick actually was out on granada avenue   and only three witnesses agree maybe two words  only three of the crown witnesses agree two words  say what mick was doing and where he was   charles montebank said that he ran around  two words   someone threw him on the ground hit his head can't remember anything   okay   well that's consistent with what mister frank wasylesko  said  he said he grabbed charles threw him  threw him back and two words   we know mick's still not involved at this point in time   colleen paske said two guys were punching and kicking charles quote continues   ladies and gentlemen quite a few words going on word but what's going on with mister  raoul eto   they wouldn't do that   they quite a few words mister raoul eto    he was curled up on the ground   they didn't stop the rest of utterance   word ladies and gentlemen a few words   ron craw a strong word  you'll recall what he said  he said mick was on the other side of the street with charles quote continues   clearly strong evidence as to what happened on granada  avenue between mick and chalres   recall mister craw's very emotional outburst   i know those words are still in your mind   he said mick was not kicking  punching or hitting charles quote continues   that's what i copied down from what mister craw said   as you'll recall it word seem like the end of a like i said a an emotional outburst from mister craw   and that ladies and gentlemen is exactly what my client said he was doing  he said he went out onto granada avenue got there   he took mister uh charles montebank from frank wasylesko   colleen was holding onto him  pulled her away  he pulled charles away from colleen   turned him around and walked back into the bar  he didn't appear to be unconscious to mick  but you know he could have been dazed maybe three words   he even says that perhaps that he fell on the pavement  he didn't maybe three words   of course he was going to be somewhat dazed maybe somewhat unsure of himself or maybe somewhat unconscious   now the crown is going to suggest to you that my client must have done something out there because charles montebank was unconscious at this point in time and because charles montebank  doesn't remember anything that happened between that time and the time he came back to the back hallway but ask yourself these questions  if he was unconscious why would mick millner say to him come on you're under arrest   why would he talk to someone who's unconscious  that doesn't make sense cough   what about   about three words testimony that we know what happened out on ninety-third street  we know mister montebank ran away on ninety-third  street  ask yourself how can an unconscious man two words run away   sentence   i don't think mister montebank was unconscious  at the very most i'd say mister montebank was  rest of utterance   sentence   then not by my client mister mick millner   now remember too mister craw was fairly confident   that that mick or that that  charles montebank was unconscious but it was dark out there and mister craw just walked past uh mick  and charles and really didn't stick around he didn't   a few words made a comment   here's what i think   it's quite possible very possible that what he saw was mister  montebank rest of utterance   now how about this ninety-third street incident   charles can't remember it the very individual that ran away can't even remember  raoul didn't see it   don craw anne kramer wanda colleen  they didn't see them   some people did though  mike treadle he said charles ran away from the doorman but mike can't i d two words   charles trips word doorman caught him in ninety-third and bounced charles' head on the  pavement three or four times  and he identified mick millner as being that person  he says it was mick millner word  the guy that was working the front door   mike pleads with the doorman to watch his arm  mike pleads with fred   fred a few words   then you have mister ron lister saying two bouncers went to get charles quote continues   but standing beside mister ron lister was mister  michael hawker   sentence   and he was watching the same thing mister ron lister  says or was watching out there on ninety-third avenue  or ninety-third street ninth ave   avenue ninety-third street   can you recall what mister glen hawker said  he said mick went out onto ninety-ninth  grabbed charles and brought him back   that's all   there was no bouncing of the head on the pavement like a basketball no shaking anyone  sentence   fred avalon also saw what happenedthen  he says mick went out and got charles   did he see mick do anything to charles   he remembers mike freaking out  that's what he remembers  why was he so upset   he's upset because his friends got kicked out of the bar because his friends are causing problems and even now mick has brought them back into the bar to face the music   now who's telling the truth here  well let's look at the medical evidence of mister  uh mister uh charles montebank   we don't have pictures like we have pictures of  raoul's head  all we have is what the doctor said  the doctor says that he noticed a bruising on either side of the head 
Canada	 thank you my lord  ladies and gentlemen i as i i'd mentioned earlier when i made my opening remarks that i'd later on have a chance to speak with you in a little more detail   that's obviously what i'm going to do now   mister phelan had raised a number of points and i quite frankly don't intend to go over them all again   what i did want to do is kind of give you one comment he had made  during my summation to you i too will be referring to evidence  i'm going to be referring to evidence that i recollect being said that i think is important based on what i want to speak to you about  and i just want to raise the same points he did  it's that you're the ones who determine what the evidence is   not me   not the judge   it's you   and if i say anything that you don't recall you win  i don't want you misinterpret what i'm saying now word  because the way this case started i believe we definitely gave you council's remarks they're not evidence and this is not evidence  when the trial started the judge told you you would hear the evidence  you would then hear the summation  what's going to happen now is that i'm going to go over  evidence that i think is important  i'm going to speak to you about my client herbert   when i'm finished doing that both mister lebouf and mister lister will have the opportunity to address you  then mister rawls on behalf of the crown will have the opportunity to address you  and ultimately the judge will give you some instructions   what i'd ask at this time is that you just give me maybe ten or fifteen minutes of your attention while i go over things that i feel are important on behalf of herbert wasylesko   i want to reinforce just a couple of points that mister phelan  had made when he was standing chatting with you  the first one is that herbert wasylesko is an innocent man unless and until you say otherwise  point number one  you have to be satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt  the second point that mister phelan made and i want to come back to my client has absolutely no onus to establish to you  throughout this case the crown bears the onus of proving  herbert wasylesko 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt   i'd like to really get into what what  i suggest maybe three words ladies and gentlemen   not one of the witnesses that you have heard over the last two weeks have stated that they saw herbert wasylesko kick or strike raoul eto   now i point out to you  this is another reason i'll be summing up shorter i anticipate than my friend  simply this  my client faces one charge   the charge of raoul eto and in that assault bodily harm was caused  that's the case in a nutshell  the judge will go into more detail with you  my client is really only concerned with raoul eto    and none of the witnesses not even the crown witnesses   the crown bears the onus of proof  none of them have been able to say they saw herbert wasylesko  do what he's charged with  what has been established i suggest and is accepted by the crown witnesses is that there were a lot of people present throughout that evening apart from the employees and there was a lot of alcohol being involved   mister phelan pointed out the obvious   there's no evidence a few words   they were there doing their job   you've heard a number of witnesses over the last two weeks  and i certainly don't intend to review everything they've said  as i mentioned my client faces one count  if i were to review all the evidence in two weeks i might be here two weeks doing it   but i do want to touch briefly on the evidence of some of the witnesses kind of separate the wheat from the chaff as it were for your consideration   in doing this i've decided to kind of break this whole thing down into what i call four separate occurrences  you've heard evidence about the initial fight at the  washroom area   the next thing you heard was about an incident at the coat check area kind of at the front door  third thing is the situation on granada avenue after mister eto left the fire and ran away  the fourth area is the detention in the hallway  and i think in fairness that may be a good way to look at this case if i go through it on behalf of herbert and deal with each of those areas  i want to start of course with the disturbance at the washroom  now you'll recall herbert wasylesko took the stand  and his evidence was that he was at the front door area taking the cover charge when he heard about this initial skirmish   he said he came partly down the hall  he was following his brother frank   saw matters were under control and at that point returned to his duties  now ronald craw confirmed the scuffle by the washroom  but i believe he said he couldn't see anything  there was a crowd of people around   wanda palmer you recall testified about this initial scuffle   wanda wisha said much the same as mister silverman  said  mister eto himself confirms that  and although he did state he didn't recall being involved in a fight with a person he had pulled off i believe he does state that his mouth  was was bleeding at that time   finally we have frank wasylesko and johnny steen  saying that they brought mister eto up towards the coat check area and i believe herbert wasylesko said basically the same thing  so i suggest that there's absolutely no evidence  absolutely nothing that connects my client herbert with anything in that initial skirmish  i don't intend to talk about it anymore   second one the incident by the coat check  i think it's fairly clear that something occurred there  we've had different stories from different people but virtually all the witnesses that i just referred to confirm that there was something that went on at the coat check area  i don't think that's in dispute  mister avalon the manager you recall he was very clear in stating that when he came upon this he didn't see the beginning of it  when he came upon it there was herbert wasylesko holding an individual two words   if you put the evidence together that individual was mister  raoul eto   i believe mister avalon also indicated that he heard  herbert say to this person just relax just settle down  that there was no real fight there  it was just mister herbert wasylesko loosely holding  a few words mister eto   i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen what we have there is simply this herbert doing his job doing what's required of him doing nothing more nothing less  there's no evidence there of herbert wasylesko  threatening or intimidating mister eto   there's no evidence of herbert wasylesko being angry  there's no evidence of herbert wasylesko doing any violence whatsoever  i'm going to come back to that   but as far as that second incident goes again i suggest that there's absolutely nothing here to suggest that herbert wasylesko  was in any way dealing with a few words   i don't intend to go further than that   the third area is i guess we'll all refer to it as the outside incident   there's certainly no doubt that herbert wasylesko was the individual involved in apprehending mister eto but i'd like you to consider the following evidence from the following witnesses  they all admit some very important things   number one they do tend to acknowledge that it's quite possible that there were five or six people chasing after mister eto   i believe he also stated not all those people were doormen   in fact i believe he specifically stated there were some other people involved who were not doormen  i'd ask you to think carefully on that evidence when you're make your deliberations   we've then got mister hawker   mister hawker referred to a bunch of guys going after raoul eto   mister lister inferred there was a major commotion with lots of people around and it was possible six people went after mister eto   colleen paska i believe her evidence word  was that she kind of went outside with the flow of people  a few words   she did state there were a number of people outside   then we come to ronald craw   now ronald craw said there were at least four or five people who went out the door   and although herbert wasylesko was sitting in this courtroom in open trial mister craw did not identify him as one of the individuals he saw kicking mister eto   he did state the individual had dark word   the evidence says mister herbert wasylesko was wearing a white t-shirt   now mister phelan had spoken briefly of inferences  and i'd like you to think of this   herbert wasylesko according to the evidence of himself and mister avalon and i believe frank was at the front door taking cover charges that evening   mister craw came in i suggest that mister  herbert wasylesko had mister craw to deal with as he came in  how could he not  and yet a few hours later mister craw is not able to say herbert wasylesko was ultimately doing anything to mister  eto   obviously mister herbert wasylesko completely denies it  that's fine then because mister craw is one of those witnesses who wasn't as drunk as the rest of the crowd was  i suggest to you the reason he didn't identify mister  herbert wasylesko as kicking mister eto is because mister  herbert wasylesko was not kicking mister eto   the last thing with mister craw is actually  to look at is this common because i believe he said when he was out in the street he heard a lot of yelling about a knife   the knife was a concern  mister craw knew the knife was a concern  that's why then a few words other people  word   mister avalon again another crown witness his evidence was that he heard people on the street   goes around the corner  he saw john steen on the ground struggling with raoul eto   he saw herbert wasylesko standing there  he saw someone else there whom i believe he just  just couldn't identify that person   and he also referred to a crowd of people  and i ask you to go back in your memories and  and recall what he said  i thought that his indication was that there were about ten people outside when he went out there  so we've obviously got a fairly large crowd of people around mister eto   mister avalon also said that he saw herbert wasylesko  hold the knife   he then saw mister herbert wasylesko assist john steen in getting raoul eto to his word   bringing him back into the building  fred avalon also said a little bit later that evening this is as i understand the evidence just shortly after all of this  charles montebank goes into his office  now john steen is definitely placing charles montebank out there as well as herbert wasylesko   and then raoul eto   raoul eto 's word was that there were he used the words a lot of guys there when he was talking about this thing on granada avenue   and then he heard comments regarding them looking  for the knife  and i believe he further stated that people were  hitting me and kicking me and looking for the knife   this knife is important obviously  mister craw knows it's out there  raoul eto himself has given evidence indicating that people were looking hard for the knife   herbert wasylesko has got on the stand and he has told you what his involvement was on the street   ladies and gentlemen i ask you to just think about this  herbert wasylesko went out the door   there's lots of word out the door yelling about a knife  herbert wasylesko himself goes out the door  why does he go out the door  to find the knife   he did find the knife   we've got witnesses who say that herbert wasylesko had the knife 
Canada	 how could he be looking for the knife kicking  why would he be looking for the knife and kicking  he went out there very focused on one thing  john steen 's out there and there's this guy with a knife  he went out and he helped john steen and he found the knife and that's all he did   and independent witnesses and a number of them i suggest ladies and gentlemen a number of people have confirmed that there were a number of people on the street and no one no one has stated that they saw  herbert wasylesko kick or strike raoul eto any time that evening but for sure on the street  nobody   to the hallway the fourth area that herbert wasylesko  was involved in i suppose in the whole scheme of things from all the evidence you've heard  well the evidence of herbert wasylesko is he and  john steen brought raoul eto into the hallway area  and herbert said he then left to go out to the coat check  he further states that he stuck his head in once maybe twice  i'm not sure what he said on that point  and at no point did he see anything going on in the hallway  i think all the evidence suggests you've got four people in the hallway  you've got frank with mister eto   you've got hawker and mister montebank   that's it  fred avalon fred avalon supports that   he knows somebody was in the coat check  i believe he kind of said by assumption it had to be herbert  because there was nobody else left around unaccounted for  and herbert told you directly yes i was in the coat check   and there's not one witness crown or defence not one witness here who has herbert wasylesko in that in that hallway kicking or striking raoul eto   the evidence is he's in there twice   he's in there obviously the first time when he brings mister  eto in with john steen   that ties in nicely with what mister millner said that that hallway area was to be used if you will as a detention area a holding cell until the police came  he brings him in  the situation's under control  he leaves  when does he come back  he comes back when the police are coming in to help his brother to pick up raoul eto to have him ready for the police to arrest  word   that's when herbert wasylesko is in the room   those are the four areas ladies and gentlemen that i wanted  to to deal with  and i'm sure like i said there's certainly more evidence  i mean i haven't tried to condense the trial into fifteen minutes  but i want to now briefly turn to a few other kind of overall things  just when you're assessing the whole case and what makes sense and what doesn't there's a couple things i'd like you to think about   the first one i i'd mentioned a bit earlier   most of the crown witnesses had been drinking   now certainly the five involved if you will  when i say the five involved i mean the five at the table   there was evidence i believe it was from mister craw that mister montebank was actually staggering   i believe tom dytmer had indicated that everybody there was having a good time  it was bloodshot eyes glassy   look at raoul eto 's behaviour that night  can you infer from his behaviour that he was sober   the point is this what we've got is five individuals at the table for sure who are fairly drunk and that is obviously going to affect their recollection of a lot of events  i think if you recall my friend mister phelan had gone through some of those things  for instance a few words et cetera  that's something to keep in mind  you've got the crown witnesses are all drunk  defence witnesses are all sober  they're there doing their job   raoul eto   raoul eto was there in the room  the police come in and what does he say to them then   nothing  now let's be logical here  if raoul eto had been subjected to a vicious beating in that room why wouldn't he right away as soon as the police come in start hollering about it  he's not hollering about it  they have to put him in cuffs to get him out  why did they put him in cuffs  i think we can infer he was upset   he was still rambunctious  he was mad  he was drunk  he was furious  and about two hours later approximately constable reif  comes by  and it was either constable holden or constable walker  ladies and gentlemen who said yeah i knew when we were going back that arrests were going to be made   what do we got here  we've got constable reif coming to arrest  he knows there's been an incident with a knife  he comes takes raoul eto   mister montebank i believe walks him under his own  word   two hours later we've got constable reif back  who's he arresting   he's arresting people   he's arresting people who raoul eto has identified  well who's raoul eto identifying   anybody working that night  who hasn't he identified throughout all the rest of his  evidence  he has never identified the people who he says are doing  this supposed violence to him  certainly he does not ever say herbert wasylesko did anything to me  he never said herbert wasylesko did anything to  charles montebank   constable reif has the opportunity to talk to an intoxicated mister eto an intoxicated mister montebank an intoxicated partner and the intoxicated two words  and goes roaring back and arrests everybody  now think about this   herbert wasylesko said he gave the knife to constable  reif   john steen says herbert wasylesko gave the knife to constable reif   where did the knife go  well we know herbert had it in his jeans   i believe he said he has put it in his pocket   now i point out constable reif did have notes  a few words that night  i'm sure he said that in his examination two words  yeah i word have notes of everything that has happened in the back   he says that it was john who gave him the knife  that doesn't make sense  herbert does it  herbert goes up to him when he first comes into the room gives him the knife   constable reif at that point is i want to get this  raoul eto arrested and out of here because of what he's done  here today   why would herbert wasylesko do that  if he'd done something wrong that night if he'd done something wrong that night he wouldn't want to be anywhere around  constable reif when he came in  he wouldn't want to try to explain what happened   for the exact same reason i suggest that mister phelan  put to you  he'd want to disassociate himself   he doesn't want to have nothing to do with raoul eto   raoul eto again  raoul eto stated he had the knife with him for the purposes of self-defence  but i remind you ladies and gentlemen one person that night was wielding a knife   that was raoul eto   that had nothing to do with self-defence  raoul eto the kind of a man you'll recall who defends himself with his mouth and then he bites the guy   what happened that evening after raoul eto  stuck the knife into the tire certainly not in self-defence and he's running around outside the establishment with a knife  now steen goes out to assist  now steen is herbert wasylesko 's boss  herbert wasylesko goes out to assist  they're going to get and find the guy with the knife bring him back in and let the police deal with him  and what does all the evidence point to happening  herbert finds the knife  herbert helps mister steen bring mister eto  back in and the police come   that's exactly consistent with everything that all the witnesses stated   the point i raised earlier  i'd spoken about the point at which mister herbert wasylesko was holding mister eto at the front area the coat check you recall  do you believe ladies and gentlemen that herbert wasylesko who was at that point at the coat check area calm doing his job restraining somebody who wants to get involved in a little bit of a fracas all of the sudden bang going crazy   all of the sudden he changes from being a corny expression i'll use it anyway a clean-cut young man  two and a half years university  he's had a steady job at quik-e-mart for years  he's a businessman  he's got his own establishment  all of the sudden this guy who not two minutes before was reasonable and acting appropriately goes crazy in conjunction i point out with three other individuals   it's just unbelievable  it just doesn't make sense  why would why would herbert wasylesko act that way   the last thing about mister eto i'd like to touch on ladies and gentlemen at this point he's given you some estimates of time throughout the course of the word which i'd suggest to you are just totally just totally word   i believe you recall in the examination in chief he said he had been at word for about an hour and a half when the first skirmish broke out   all the other witnesses i thought indicated that time frame was about three hours   mister eto says to you it felt like i was in that hallway ten or fifteen minutes before the police arrived   let's take the same timeline and extrapolate that to when constable reif word there  a few words down the hallway  he got there right away  with that ladies and gentlemen even if you want to give  raoul eto the benefit of the doubt it's certainly clear that his recollection is unreliable   it certainly appears that he's had his agenda as mister  phelan said   in summary ladies and gentlemen i just leave you with this  i suggest it's very clear very clear on all the evidence you've heard over past weeks that herbert wasylesko is an innocent man and had nothing to do with anything  i ask you to return a verdict acquitting him of the charges he's facing silence, about 40 seconds   okay thank you my lord  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  this is the second time that i've had the pleasure of addressing you and it is the final time that i get to address you and explain to you and set forth for you what my client word in this case  and ladies and gentlemen if i recall back to my opening i believe i neglected to introduce myself at that point in time  let me take that opportunity now  my name is gerald fedor   i work with a firm called stewart and company based in  macaroon and my client is mister mick millner   when you were sworn as jurors in this case each of you undertook a duty to give mick millner not just mick millner to give all of the accused cough a fair trial  you undertook that you would give this case the same anxious  consideration and accord him a fair trial and afford him the same presumption of innocence and the same benefit of a reasonable doubt that you if you any of you were in this word would have a right to expect at the hands of twelve of your uh fellow citizens  these principles of the presumption of innocence of reasonable doubt that myself and mister phelan before me and mister barker  before me and i'm sure mister fincher after me will  indicate to you have been tried and tested in our courts of law and they have withstood all challenges  anyone can be charged with a criminal offence and they may very well be innocent   that is why the jury system is one of the cornerstones of our  society  the jury system stands between the power and the state and the members of the public  it stands between the power of the state and you and i  word   in a very short while ladies and gentlemen you will you twelve people will retire to commence the serious duty that you're sworn or  word to undertake  the decision which you will ultimately make and it is an  important decision will affect my client's life  there's no question about that   where are you going to begin  where do you begin with the examination  our system of justice gives you a starting point  may i suggest that that starting point is this presumption of innocence 
Canada	 that's how she got out there  that's her best chance of getting back  and even though she didn't want to at that point i'd suggest that probably at that point though she didn't wanna  want to go through with what she'd agreed to go through with it's because she 's got nervous with these men that she probably thought her best way out of there was to uhm go through with the uh prostitution agreement get out of there and hopefully nothing would happen   but then when mr lepieu bailed out she gets lost    at that point i suggest that it's a matter for you to decide but i suggest that paddy warbucks  didn't have a chance to leave at that point  very definitely wanted to leave at that point  and from that point on i suggest we have someone that has  could be 'is' been mislead about where they were taking them  that was unlawfully confined from the point at which they took her beyond   toony road   that once she was at that house that she was effectively unlawfully confined  she was assaulted  she was dragged by the hair   and ultimately raped   and ultimately defended herself   that's what the defence suggests was the scenario  sure she agreed that she would uh be involved in prostitution with these men  she didn't agree to being abused  she didn't agree to go to toony   once the agreement was breached there was no longer  three or four words with them  and i suggest that the fact that she took two hundred dollars at that point she was probably looking i suggest at what's the best way out of this problem  first i take the money and so the other way would be   i'll take the money two or three words walk  i'll take it back to name   but the next word that holds clear that uh  hour and a half of uh   she hadn't agreed times two hundred dollars worth of abuse  she didn't agree she didn't laugh around   she agreed to have sex for money and that's all she agreed to  and the one thing that i could see going through one of your minds or perhaps through my learned friend's mind is well  why did she hit him more than two to three times   well in that vein if one pictures the fact that this man was so much larger than her word much stronger than her and her rather isolated feeling out there   the last thing that you want is an enraged violent mean person that you just hurt by hitting him with a hammer him  taking off and coming after you  uhm i suggest that once she decided that her life was in danger  she had no alternative in her mind except put the guy down so he  'd stay down  whether she knew for sure that he would die she certainly intended i suggest to hurt him to a great great word    we two or three words with that   and she felt it was necessary according to her testimony  and she did it  and unless you can be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that that position is not true that's the end of the matter  that   if there's even a possiblity that that's correct uhm she's entitled to be found not guilty  the uhm on that you and the court have to determine her credibility   she was on the witness stand longer than perhaps any other witness   and uh s' it's very hard for us to put ourselves in the place of of someone else and say is she reacting as a truthful witness would   and did she react the way a reasonable person would react  out of word   you can't put yourself into that position  it's very very difficult to that is  to see the world through someone else's eyes  or what would be reasonable force for someone else    how terrified would you be   i don't remember the last time i was terrified  i remember being frightened for a split second word  or startled but i don't remember the last time that i was terrified for half and hour forty-five minutes  word can you  can you picture a time when you were terrified for that long   and so unless you can i suggest you'll great great deal of difficulty imagining what was going through paddy warbucks  's mind as her fear built and built and built when she was abandoned  by mr lepieu with this mean violent man   likewise when she's could be very fast 'she wez' up here on the witness stand trying to recreate that scene and trying to  paint that picture for you people very difficult  i suggest she made an admirable job of it and i suggest that her testimony was truthful and honest   there are things that i suggest as a lawyer that i  word noticed and i'm gonna  going to point out to you but ultimately you'll have to be the judge of whether you thought she was telling the truth but little things like she was asked about whether she borrowed money thirty dollars from uh anna swinton   she said no   and word anna swinton yeah i owe her thirty dollars  well why was that   well i she came in here and sold me rest of utterance   and that doesn't make her look bad  i mean she didn't have to tell you that but she did  tape cuts out   ladies and gentlemen of the jury it is now my responsibility to direct you with respect to the law   and as i mentioned earlier as to the law you must accept  word   but equally definite is your role in judgment of the facts  you and you alone have the responsibility in fact the sole responsibility for determining what are the facts in this case  both counsels for the accused and word  crown counsel have reviewed the facts at some length and that is their responsibility and duty as counsel   but what they have said about the facts based on the evidence can either be accepted by you or rejected by you   it is for you alone to make that determination   now for the purpose of assisting you i'm going to go over some of the evidence as i recollect it   but if you disagree with my recollection of the evidence it is the way that you recollect the evidence and not the way that i recollect it that is important   because i have said previously you are the sole judge of the facts   now nothing and i underline that nothing has been proven in this case until you the members of the jury make a determination that it has been proven   as i go through the evidence i may say that this has been proven  or that has been proven or draw your attention to a certain piece of evidence which i think is two or three words   or i may say that this is a fact or that is a fact  but unless i say to you categorically that this is a matter of law  that i speak then i'm not incorrect in stating that anything has been established because nothing has been established until you the members of the jury have made that decision   i may suggest to you that certain inferences and conclusions can be drawn from the facts so that you will have little difficulty in arriving at a certain conclusion  and i'll be doing that later when i go over the case in  some detail   but in the end it is up for you and you alone as to whether any inference should be drawn or any conclusion should be drawn or if a fact's proven   and you are only to consider the evidence that was presented to you  from the witness box and and nothing else   you are not to consider anything that you may have heard outside the courtroom   the decision on which evidence you accept as credible or worthy of belief is entirely for you to make   and this case that's on the stand is a matter  of determining credibility  it is for you to decide which witnesses and which evidence you accept and which evidence you reject   you may accept a portion of the evidence as i stated in my opening  given by a witness or you may reject it  you may accept parts of it or you e ma   you may reject parts of it   or you may reject all of the evidence two or three words  now an honest witness can sometimes be mistaken   and when a number of different people observe a particular event  and that is especially so when there is a stress involved  people sometimes see things differently   but then differences in evidence may indicate to you  that the witnesses did not get together and manufacture or rehearse the story  you may consider that a healthy sign or in the alternative you may decide that a witness or witnesses are deliberately trying to deceive  that's for you to say if this honest witness may be telling the truth in some part of his or her evidence   you are also entitled to make reasonable deductions and draw reasonable inferences and conclusions from the facts which you accept out of the evidence given in this trial   i must also emphasize the position of an expert witness  and we did have one expert that was involved in this case dr  seuss   an expert is a witness who by reason of special skill and training is able to give opinion evidence within his or her  field   an expert witness who gives his or her opinion is no different  from any other witness as far as your right to accept or reject all or part of the evidence is concerned  you can accept the opinion of the expert but if in your opinion the facts indicate a different result you are to take your opinion and reject the expert opinion   and if on any matter the expert is wrong in your view if you draw a different conclusion than that of the exp   than that of the expert you have the absolute right  to do so  that's the jury's responsibility  you are here because you are presumed to be calm  reasonable and inclement   and this is a case where you should exercise your good old-fashioned common sense   you are entitled to draw from your experiences in life and your associations in life your knowledge of life and that of your fellow  citizens  so what i'm saying is just apply some good old- common  - fashioned fashioned good old-fashioned common sense     it's so important   utterance   now as mentioned by counsel this is a very very important  corner pronounced coroner cornerstone   in our democracy and canadian law that the accused in this case we have three of them come into this court as innocent men   the law presumes them to be innocent as to these charges sorry  i suppose that should be this charge i'm sorry there's only one charge until the charge has been proven by the crown beyond a reasonable doubt   now under our legal system there is absolutely no obligation on the accused to prove their innocence could be 'they're innocent' - - voice lowers   they don't have to prove anything   and there's no ob they did testify in this case but there's no obligation whatsoever for them  to to to go on the stand and tell their stories   the crown must prove each and every ingredient of the offence  necessary to sustain the charge beyond a reasonable doubt   and that burden through the trial never shifts  it's on the crown at the start of the trial throughout the trial and it's on the crown right now   and i said before the crown must establish the guilt of the accused to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt   and those are critical words in this case  counsel four or five words   and in most criminal cases that is the most important aspect  of the case  i'm going to repeat that phrase over and over again in my charge and if sh i should say to your satisfaction and meets your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt   then that then brings us to the question what is a reasonable doubt  what do those words mean   the words reasonable and the word doubt they're ordinary words  we use them in our everyday language and our on our everyday lives   they're not magical or mysterious or mythical so you should give them their ordinary meanings 
Canada	" but you must recognize that a reasonable doubt is not a fanciful doubt or a figment of your imagination   it is not one that we conjure pronounced "" con'jure"" up to make our job a little easier  reasonable doubt must have real substance  it must be found again upon that good old common sense which i mentioned earlier in my charge  the crown must prove the guilt of the accused as i have said beyond a reasonable doubt and not on the mere balance of probability   if the crown fails to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt then it is your obligation as jurors and your duty to acquit   reasonable doubt has to be an honest doubt  proof beyond a reasonable doubt is that degree of proof which convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience  the law does not require that the charge be proved against the accused to a degree of absolute certainty but if there is a reasonable doubt on anything during the trial and i mean anything it must be resolved in favour of the accused   this applies not only to the ultimate question you must  you must deal with today but applies to all the evidence and to any intermediate questions that you might ask yourselves  as you proceed along towards your verdict   now a very distinguished english juror he put it very   succi succinctly rather than the lengthy definition i gave to you  he says are you certain and i think that's as good a definition as any  if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not to believe a witness the benefit of the doubt must go to the accused   if after weighing or considering carefully all the evidence you have an abiding conviction amounting to a moral certainty that the accused has committed the offence for which he is charged and there're three accused in this case and there can be no reasonable doubt then you must convict  but if you are wavering or if you are unable to come to an abiding conviction or you if you have some lingering or nagging doubt with respect to the proof of some essential element of the offence then you must give that doubt to the accused  and it is your duty to acquit   in criminal trials ladies and gentlemen the jury's verdict  must be unanimous   this does not mean that you must reach a verdict  but in order to reach a verdict of guilty with respect to each of the accused you must be unanimous   to reach a verdict of not guilty with respect to each of the accused you must also be unanimous   if it happens that one or more of you cannot agree with the others after you have conscientiously applied yourself to the task then there can be no verdict and you must then ultimately report that fact  could possibly be 'back' to me   but you must not abandon your own conscience or conclusions just for the sake of reaching a verdict   now in this case i'm satisfied that you will all apply yourselves diligently and conscientiously to the task clears throat and that you'll be able to reach a verdict  but you must bear in mind that the responsibility is on the crown to word establish  the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of each and every one of you   if the accused is to be found guilty each of you individually must agree that sufficient proof and necessary proof has been presented so you can one or two words arrive at that conclusion  now those are my general remarks ladies and gentlemen of the jury  and i'm now going to turn to the word  specific charge that's before you before you   today sound quality drops for approximately next 8 minutes   now the i mentioned the charge and uh it's referred to legally as the indictment and that's the document that you will take into the jury room   when i say indictment i mean the charge  and it reads you'll recall the clerk reading it out at the start of the case  judge reads indictment aloud   now that's the charge   the appicable the applicable provision  of canadian criminal code rest of utterance  judge reads from code   now i'm going to go through very carefully for you the essential ingredients of the offence  word the crown to succeed on the charge  it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following ingredients  one first the identity of the accused and that  two or three words any issue in this case that's for you to decide but they all they all testified   secondly the time and place of the event as set out in the indictment  again that is for you to decide but i don't think we're  going to have any difficulty in respect to the time soft word or pause place  three that the accused applied force directly or indirectly to the complainant sarah   that the accused had intended to apply force to the complainant   and the crown would also have to show that the complainant  sarah did not consent to the application of the  force and that the accused knew that the victim did not consent  and the last ingredient one or two words  is that the assault was of a sexual nature   now i'm going to deal with one or two of the ingredients that need more detailed instructions   one of the ingredients that i talked about was that the crown must prove that the accused applied force directly or indirectly to sarah  and force simply means physical contact  you can be forced without physical violence  in other words this ingredient has proved if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that force was was applied   the next ingredient is the matter of intention   the crown must prove that the accused intended to apply  force to sarah   and if people intend to do things they do them deliberately  it is different when people are careless and do things accidentally   when people do things accidentally they do not intend to do them a few words charge   now the next matter that i want to touch on is what is meant by a  sexual assault  an assault is sexual when the person who commits the assault  does so for the purpose of gratifying his or her sexual appetite  and there's a very recent decision of the supreme court of  canada and i'll read to you two paragraphs to give you a little more detail as to what is maybe a word meant by a sexual assault  the supreme court of canada said judge reads aloud from ruling   the intent or purpose of the person committing the act to the extent which it may appear from the evidence may also be a factor  and when you're considering the business of consent   and i i you should also consider the  word   when a person consents to being touched that consent will only cover the certain amount of touching  it does not cover touching that goes beyond the consent  for example supposing a person agrees to be kissed   that consent would only cover kissing  it does not cover something further for example petting or intercourse   word you're gonna going to have to decide word all the evidence  word consent word this case  now considering whether the conduct was sexual   if the motive of the accused is sexual gratification to the extent that this word appear from the evidence it may be a factor in determining whether the conduct is sexual   now as to this case i agree with all counts although the real issue is whether you believe sarah or the three accused  it is for you to decide whether you accept the evidence of  sarah that roger had intercourse with her without consent  and that peter had anal intercourse again without her consent  and i doubt whether you will have any difficulty in finding  the those two incidents ah that she described  were sexual assault as i have defined it for you here  however the defence evidence is that sarah consented to have intercourse with roger and that the act of anal intercourse with peter never occurred as he specifically denied that he engaged in that activity   therefore the credibility of sarah and the accused  will be the main issue uh at this trial   i therefore intend to review the evidence and with the proviso that if you your recollection is different that mine and you regard evidence other evidence  as more important then it's your recollection or what you deem important in the final analysis uh a few words  facts  the complainant sarah smith when she testified in court now sixteen years of age and is residing in sunny town  sun state   on february the seventeenth of nineteen ninety-two  she was visiting friends in salem   as sarah 's birthday was on march the first  she would've been fourteen at the time the incident occurred   when she was visiting salem she was staying with her friend tara in the hello area in salem   at noon on february the seventeenth sarah and her friend donna jones were having lunch at the hunter's mall  they observed the accused roger rabbit at a nearby  table  although neither sarah or donna knew roger  they made eye contact with him   roger left the restaurant and went to the arcade  and the boys and the girls in my recollection of the evidence they subsequently joined joined   roger gave them his telephone number so that they could arrange to go out later   roger said that both donna and sarah  were in make up and sarah was dressed in a skirt blouse and sweater and was also wearing cowboy boots   after roger returned home the girls tele phoned him  and after some difficulty they found his residence   and as roger did not have transportation the accused  peter dunstan picked them up in his car   as roger received an income tax refund you recall they spent some time driving around trying to cash the cheque  they went to maggie's a local restaurant  where they talked about peter 's birthday   roger 's friend juan orzon was also with them  sarah told roger that she was seventeen and  donna said she was eighteen   juan in jest then asked to see their i d   roger then went to the liquor store and purchased a bottle of sambuca and a case of beer  they eventually went to a residence where peter 's uh friends ta tomas   mike and juan were residing   without revee revealing in detail as to what next ensued it is suffice to say that roger  peter sarah donna and others began to  party   they consumed a large amount of alcohol and sarah  became very intoxicated   from time to time other individuals attended at the residence including the accused ma matthew childs mike nelson and andrea griffin   who was tomas 's girlfriend  roger and peter and some of his friends were smoking marijuana   during the party sarah was dancing with matthew  and others and sometime early in the evening she tore her skirt   she then borrowed a pair of blue jeans from roger   andrea observed sarah clinging to roger   and she said she was very intoxicated   and she said sarah was very loud and from time to time was hugging and kissing roger   tomas said that sarah was intoxicated and on one occasion he observed that she fell in the kitchen and there is also evidence that she fell outside   later that evening many of those attending the party including the three accused sarah and donna decided to visit a local watering hole with the name of streamers'  two or three words   they drove to streamers' in juan 's automobile  on the way to the bar sarah was sitting on roger  's lap and they were necking   sarah was unable to go into the bar as she was underage  she therefore returned to the car and due to her intoxicated condition she slept for over two hours  the partygoers left streamers' at about two a m  and returned to maybe a word place   there i agree with counsel there doesn't   appear to be many or any major conflicts with the testimony between  sarah and the three accused until four or five words  streamers'   sarah testified that shortly after they arrived  roger took her upstairs to a bedroom where peter had been  sleeping   he said he pulled her on the bed and started kissing her   sarah told him no i do not want to do this  she said roger took off his pants and her jeans and that  peter ripped off her shirt and brassiere  sarah said when they went in the bedroom she realized what roger wanted and she made it clear that she did not want to have sex with either peter or roger "
Canada	 thank you ladies and gentlemen for being so attentive  the uhm duty you have here is obviously a great responsibility and certainly my client appreciates ah your  word in this regard and   quite frankly this is word probably the highest duty that can uhm be placed upon citizens in this country  and that is giving judgment upon one of their fellow citizens on charges of murder  as you probably know word a  responsibility that could be cast upon the shoulders of any person  in that regard the uhm whenever  there's a charge of murder we three or four words   at that point someone is dead   and quite frankly my remarks are extremely focused  word in on those aspects that  subconsciously one has to overcome the idea because we're not accustomed to having uh bodies that die by trauma  it's all very uh unnatural and unusual  but that doesn't mean that a crime was committed  in fact i really wish three or four words   there's no crime committed unless you twelve people decide that there was a crime committed  that uhm  if i find word lawfully three words then there's no crime  it's as simple as that  the uhm ah the two words even asked himself to two words  something that he two words   being logical and being sarcastic you ask yourself again that he shouldn't have done anything wrong  but i suggest that when you're confronted with the stark reality afterwards a dead body and something that's referred to as a  murder weapon four or five words crime   my suggestion has been there is no murder weapon  yet  there was a hammer inside   he was killed by a hammer   but that doesn't make it murder  and and we shouldn't talk about   after the murder or the murder weapon    unless you jurors decide that it was a murder it was simply  a death and the hammer was the instrument which effected that  now moving onto uh the second issue which like the judge two or three words   the most fundamental of all rules in our justice system which makes us as a civilized society quite different from  some societies that at least uhm from my opinion for et  for whatever it's worth are less civilized because  that is the rule that the power for the state to convict one of its citizens of a crime that they must show beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was perpertrated and perpertrated by the accused  beyond a reasonable doubt  that of course is the ruling in many places  in many places the tribunal gets to interrogate the accused often in a less than satisfactory manner and there is no burden on the state to prove guilt but rather the  the accused must convince the uh tribunal that they're  innocent   and the idea of proving something beyond a reasonable doubt  what makes sense is the state should have to prove that the accused is guilty   the one thing that i'd suggest subconsciously i may be wrong but i'd suggest something that you really have to keep in the forefront of your mind is not to do it on the balance of probability   because that is in my opinion the thing that would be the most likely way to decide something  what's more probable   uhm and when you're deciding something like a case  where someone is on trial for a criminal matter on any issue such as a defence such as self-defence or uh whether or not the accused did something uhm the burden is on the state to show this beyond a reasonable doubt  in other words uh five or six words that  in essence you must be sure   rather than just guessing at which is most likely you must be sure in order for you to decide something   ah i guess four or five words   so in other words dealing with what really is the key issue in the case that the defence two words  that being self-defence   i'm gonna going to word  review two or three words issues that i project bear on the issue of self-defence that   one of those is the accused taking the witness stand and telling you that she acted in self-defence   and as i mentioned before she testified and i'll mention again you can feel word   you don't have to feel that she's probably right   unless you are sure that she is wrong or five or six words sure that she's not telling the truth two words yourself that you could two or three words  it  it's possible merely possible that what she says about self-defence is correct  if that's a possibility that is reasonable then your duty  it is clean and clear  you one or two words spend any time deliberating at that point   each of the twelve of you have decided that yes there's definitely a reasonable possibility that she acted in self-defence  then your duty is very clear  you are required by law to bring a word  verdict in   not guilty   and you have done your duty   and justice has been served   and if you were to do anything else justice would die in your hands   my client will not be found guilty unless it's proved  beyond a reasonable doubt that she didn't act in self-defence and beyond a reasonable doubt that none of the lesser uh charges apply   the uhm lesser charges are always an option  and i'm not gonna going to spend a great deal of time dealing with them   but ah i shouldn't say charges ah there's one lesser charge and that is manslaughter but there's two different ways uhm that ah the defence particularly sees you might reach that result   but you only would even deal with that if you had rejected  beyond a reasonable doubt self-defence  and that is if uh if  self-defence isn't applicable so that it was shown that the person  deliberately did a killing with this murder uhm and  if the person is provoked or drunk to a certain e   degree uhm then it will be manslaughter  now i'm not going to try and explain the degree of intoxication  or the degree of provocation that would be necessary for the lesser offences  i will leave that to your lordship   however in that regard i will comment upon the other  and i trust that i currently am on your word  here  don't uh   uh i didn't take any notes three or four words   uhm i thought there were word  like you people did  and uhm i have my own misconceptions and my own difficulties hearing and   so i'll emphasize don't don't  rely on stuff that i may say may differs from the witness says  but on the issue of drunkenness uhm the  uh the one witness that was a  obviously a friend of paddy warbucks uhm  that testified right at the start three words uh  it was my recollection that she described paddy the next day  as as being uh either drunk or stoned  i don't know which one she used   and that this would uh uh be obviously  some number of hours uh we could infer after the actual incident occurred  uh likewise on the issue of drunkenness i would encourage you to consider particularly her testimony   uh the amount that she is said to drink   uhm i suggest it's not surprising she doesn't know how much she had to drink  when it's obvious that she went out to use the  word to get loaded   e i suggest that it wasn't it wasn't just a social type of drinking that one might ah in socializing  i suggest it was apparent from her abuse of prescription drugs  and alcohol that she wanted to get high   uhm and uhm that this incident happened during that time  one or two words   so as a fallback position and uh certainly not our position as a fallback position we suggest that drunkenness would reduce the  charge of murder to manslaughter in this case  alternatively or additionally you could also consider whether or not she was sufficently provoked by what i  sugge suggest was uhm rather disgusting and degrading things that were said to her   and the rather disrer disrespectful  uhm manner in which she was treated coupled with the constant yelling   plus the physical mistreatment and word  that she received  those i suggest are things you could consider with respect to provocation and word   in the event that you disagree with our position of self-defence then one of those two alternatives i have suggested  as a possibility it's up to you word  what the result is  i i think on on  guilty of manslaughter  now moving back to what we suggest should be the crux of the issue in this case and that is seven or eight words think about whether or not this looks like murder to you   uhm if you were a relatively small woman uh would you want to commit a murder where first of all you pick someone  that you don't know   you allow them to take you somewhere that you don't know  you have a witness along who you tell personal details about the past that are true   uhm this witness leaves so you know that there's   gonna going to be someone who can clearly identify you  and uh three or four words so to speak where you live   you don't take any instruments to effect this murder with you   and clears throat you uh don't have any means  to leave after you effect this murder   you don't dispose of the body in any way   word your you don't have the ability  to have even planned in advance to dispose of the body due to the process word belated discovery that there has even been a killing occur   and you've indiscriminately placed your fingerprints all over   i suggest nothing adds up to this being murder  it is completely illogical  rather i suggest much more inferentially probable that it was self-defence   and that my client who obviously has a disadvantaged past obviously was involved in prostitution at the time obviously has a criminal record by her testimony said oh no  you know   i'm in an awful situation  she panicked and and uh tries to cover things up  that doesn't make it murder but rather ineffectual and foolish  uhm treatment of the crime scene ah if in fact that's what it is  uh that doesn't make it a crime   the uh   now looking at things that might tend to support  word corroborate that it was self-defence  besides the illogicalness of this killing being murder  besides the fact that the rational look at it doesn't make sense  we have the corroboration of mr lepieu about  he's got a view of the scenario as he leaves just  not only does he leave as soon as things turn mean  as soon as my client is struck   the very fact that the picture that he had in his mind when he first heard that there'd been a death there was that it would be  paddy warbucks that died i suggest that picture was conveyed from him to us quite deliberately and word by  two words   and i'd suggest that my client's word  that she'd be the one that was dead if she hadn't done what she did are  completely corroborated by mr lepieu what mr  lepieu said that he expected a death  too in fact   that's the picture that he saw   sentence   after he left things were two or three words  before he left   further we have   ah certainly there are discrepancies  i mean mr lepieu says she was hit once she says she was hit twice  and she thinks both of those times occurred while mr  lepieu was there   someone's mistaken uhm   is mr lepieu perhaps trying to minimize the  predicament that he left this woman   is it perhaps somewhat embarrassing that he would ah  he allowed such a uh a  mean and violent thing to be happening  that someone's beating a woman that was obviously much smaller than than the agressor  uh and then you had uh the doctors evidence i suggest  supports her position that she was struck a couple of times   the uh   on in any event i also suggest that it was quite inappropriate for mr lepieu to leave  paddy warbucks at that house  he'd taken her out there and left her in quite a predicament   and i would suggest that it would be understandable for  hear her fear to be continually building   my learned friend questioned her quite thoroughly about  perhaps not embarking on other methods of trying to escape the situation   well hindsight's twenty-twenty  i mean really were any of his suggestions that were made to paddy warbucks feasible practical  reasonable   i suggest it would be reasonable right up until the point that uh  mr lepieu rest of utterance 
Canada	 sarah said she screamed and yelled   both roger and peter attempted to have oral sex with her and of course she refused   she said when she was having intercourse with roger  peter on one occasion had anal intercourse with her one or two words time  later when she was on top of roger someone was holding her  hips could be head   sarah said she scratched roger 's back   when roger was on top of her peter then said  i'm sorry sarah said she scratched his back when  roger was on top of her three or four words   peter also according to her testimony said that  you've screwed her up now   and sarah also said that she felt pain  pain in her vagina   during sarah 's testimony she stated that when she was on the bed although roger was kissing her she did not kiss him back  however in cross-examination she conceded that at  preliminary enquiry she said that she consentually kissed roger  while they were on the bed   she further testified that her answers at the preliminary  hearing were true   it was also brought out in the cross-examination that when she  was in the bedroom she admitted her memory was hazy and that she blacked out from time to time   sarah also stated that the accused matthew came into the bedroom and on one occasion pulled her legs apart  in cross-examination she said on one occasion she thought it was  matthew   on another occasion she said he tried to grab my legs  and force them apart but i wouldn't let him   again in cross-examination she again stated that she screamed and yelled and demanded that roger get off her and leave her  alone   doctor sandra grey was the first crown witness three or four words in my opening remarks   she is a family practioner in the city of salem   she's presently on medical leave and is in residency in three or four words   she said that she examined sarah around eight p m on  february the eighteenth nineteen ninety- word in the hospital in salem   she said there were bruises on the back of her left forearm and on her right forearm and her upper arm   bruises were also located in the hips both knees and her upper thighs and the crotch area   she said she also had a significant abrasion of the bottom of the vagina   this is the area she called the word   and that the bottom of the vagina had bled  she also said the opening of her vagina a few words    in chief she said in her opinion the injuries to the vaginal area were consistent with forceable entry into her vagina  without that area being lubricated  she also said that where there is sexual desire there usually  is lubrication  she also testified that she did not conduct a rectal examination as sarah did not mention anal intercourse  she did confirm however that there was no trauma around the  outside of the of the anus   in cross-examination she conceded that she did not have any opinion as to whether alcohol would have an effect on lubrication in the vagina  she again confirmed that the abrasions in the vagina were consistent with forceable non-consenting intercourse   she said if sexual desire is present in word  female lubrication is also present in almost all situations  especially in a young healthy woman who recently has started her period  she was also asked by miss flynn if the sexual activity started out with lubrication and went on for a prolonged period of time would that cause abrasion abrasions    her answer was that she said normally unless there was a long delay maybe a word more than five to ten minutes  to the point of ejaculation unless this occurred this should not  happen  she then said that because the initial lubrication provided by the female gland is supplemented of course by the ejaculate  but then she did go on to say word summary  she said that without ejaculation it might be possible but highly unusual in a very young woman who recently commenced menstruating  but really it was a fairly word  detailed summary of of of her evidence   word examination a few words  cross-examination  now the accused roger rabbit testified on his own behalf   he's now twenty-three years of age he's employed with city paving solutions   he described the event that occurred on february the seventeenth and until he testified as to what happened in the bedroom during the early hours of february the eighteenth his evidence is consistent with the other witnesses including sarah   during the party at moon street he described an incident where sarah appeared to freak out after which someone  bumped her against a chair   he said she then hit the fridge in a word  roger said his consumption that evening included three beers four shots of sambuca and one to one and a half joints of marijuana   after peter had retired to his bedroom roger said he was looking for cigarettes   he went into peter 's room sarah came with him  after the door was closed he said we kissed and then i undid my pants   sarah was on top of him and then undid her pants after  which she took them off along with her panties   peter was on the bed and was asleep  after they french-kissed she stayed on top of him   he inserted his penis in her vagina and then began to make passionate love  when they were having intercourse matthew and juan  entered the room   they saw sarah on top of him  after flicking the lights on and off matthew enquired as to where his dress pants were one to three words   after he retrieved his clothing he left the room and closed the door   sarah and roger switched positions and continued the sexual intercourse  peter woke up and he appeared to be angry  before sarah left he said she gave him her name and phone number  he testified that sarah did not say or do anything which would indicate that she was not a willing participant in their sexual  word   he also denied that peter had anal intercourse with her  word cross-examination roger said that they had sex for about twenty minutes and that he had ejaculated  in his hand multiple words   the next witness was the accused peter dunstan   he is now twenty-four years of age   he lives with his mother in salem   and since word he's been working with  word a native word   he and his girlfriend have a seven-month-old child   his evidence was to the effect that when he returned from  streamers' he was so intoxicated that he retired to his bedroom  he was awakened by sarah and roger having sex on his bed  after he told them to leave he said sarah became angry  however he said that he dressed and then left the room  he denied that he had anal intercourse with sarah or that he stated he had fucked her up the ass  when sarah and roger were having sex he said they were both undressed   the last accused to testify was matthew childs aged twenty-three   he's presently working at the easyshop word  salem   he was not a resident at moon street and therefore when he arrived at that residence he had a change of clothes including an extra pair of dress pants as he knew they were going out to  the bar later that evening  he said sometime during the evening he lent a pair of his pants to  roger as he had in turn given his jeans to sarah to wear to the bar as she had torn her skirt   after they left the bar around two a m he drove juan's car back to moon street   as he was leaving he ascertained that sarah had been asleep in the back of word car  she said she wanted to return to the party  after their return to moon street matthew some time later wanted to retrieve his pants from peter 's room  he entered his bedroom turned on the light and observed  roger and sarah having sex   he said they were naked   sarah was breathing hard   peter was asleep on the bed  after enquiring as to where his pants were he obtained them from the bed  he then turned off the light and left the room  he said he did not touch sarah or pull her legs apart   when he left peter was asleep   i want to deal with the criminal record of the accused  only applying to one witness or one accused and that would be the accused matthew   now he gave evidence and i think quite properly brought it out on his own accord   he was asked whether he'd ever been convicted of a criminal offence  he replied that he had been convicted of theft in nineteen ninety and received a fifty dollar fine  now i have to give you some instructions as to what use if any that you can make of a criminal record in a in a  trial  this criminal record was introduced into evidence not into  word only for the purpose of testing the credibility  or truthfulness of the accused as a witness   you may use the evidence of the criminal record when you consider  his credibility  in order to decide whether a person with a criminal record of this nature is the kind of witness who might be believed   please remember that a criminal record does not necessarily mean that someone is a liar in the same way that a clean record does not necessarily mean that someone is truthful   when you examine matthew 's record you should consider three things  first you should consider the nature of the offence   in particular you should consider whether matthew has committed an offence that involved dishonesty   a conviction for an offence that involves dishonesty obviously has more bearing on credibility than a conviction for an offence that does not involve dishonesty   two you should consider when matthew  committed the offence  a recent conviction may be more relevant to credibility than a conviction for an offence that was committed a long time ago   third you should consider the number of convictions   a single conviction for a criminal offence is usually less serious  than a long list of convictions  these three factors should help you to decide whether or not  you will believe the accused's evidence  i should tell you however that i do not think that this one conviction where he received a fifty dollar fine is  significant   however please remember that you are the judges of the facts and you do not have to accept my opinion  it is important for you to understand that this previous conviction is not evidence of matthew 's guilt in this trial  you are not allowed to treat that conviction as evidence that he is more likely to commit the offence with which he's charged  also you are not allowed to treat his record as evidence that he is more likely to commit criminal acts in general  the only reason this evidence of a criminal record was admitted was for a very limited purpose  it's for the purpose of deciding whether or not you can believe his testimony  and again i've said it once i'll say it again i don't think in this case that his criminal record that one charge is very  significant word   now i'm now going to continue towards the end of my charge but i will now deal with the case against each of the accused separately  i wanna want to deal wi  i'm gonna going to have to deal with  each accused separately   as to the charge against roger   if you word accept his testimony  three or four words and all the other evidence that was  word and particularly the testimony that sarah  consented to the act of intercourse then you must return a verdict of not guilty  even if you do not accept the evidence word  for the defence that sarah consented but you are left with a reasonable doubt then you must also return a verdict of not guilty  even if you are not left with a reasonable doubt by the testimony according to roger that sarah consented to have sex with him you must still go on to determine whether or not he is guilty  in other words you must be satisfied that the crown has proved  each and every ingredient of the offence as i instructed you earlier   to sustain the charge beyond a reasonable doubt two or three words guilty  but if you come to that conclusion of course then four or five words guilty  as i said earlier i keep repeating this as it's so important the crown must establish the guilt of roger beyond a reasonable doubt 
Canada	 now all these pictures that you have two words  to take into the jury room  when frank was arrested uh on the early morning hours of  november the second nineteen ninety-two uh he was instructed by myself shortly after his release uh later on that day to get into a  three words have pictures of his hands done knowing what the  allegations were against him  now the pictures of the hands ladies and gentlemen will  and i word unfortunately i don't have copies  of them but i'd like to show you  this picture on the front shows frank's two hands taken from a a position above two words  you can see on his right hand there appears to be a well-healed cut  this picture was taken about thirty-six hours after uhm frank  was arrested rest of utterance   it's dated on the third i understand about nine o'clock a few words   that scar even according to constable driscoll was well-healed word   it wasn't fresh  it wasn't bleeding at all  and the only comment that constable driscoll had was with respect to another small uh red mark or a nick maybe three words which you can see in the last picture ladies and gentlemen next to or approximately half an inch from the well-healed cut  it's very it's sometimes difficult to pick up exactly what what that is but it  it is appears to be a red mark  didn't draw blood  sentence   now it's important to look at these pictures when you assess whether or not frank wasylesko had punched raoul eto in that back hallway or punched anybody throughout this uh this  the encounter in the washroom area all the way through to the back room  firstly that little scar the one he had before the well-healed one hasn't split open you'll recall   secondly none of his there are no other bruises or indications of lacerations or abrasions on any of his knuckles left or right hand except that little tiny red nick   if he was sitting there punching raoul as  raoul eto suggests one would think that there would be open cuts  or bruises or abrasions on one or more of his knuckles  now if he is right-handed  i don't know if that's a few words   sentence   even if he was left-handed uh there's nothing to indicate on either hand that there's such a word and that cut is not uh is not split open at all  now if and and you have to  picture the back hall raoul eto is is   lying down as i understand the evidence and he suggests that he was kicked kicked and punched  constable reif has a pool of blood  not splattered on the wall not splattered on the floor but a pool   herbert wasylesko's evidence is that yes there was a pool  maybe three words dripping from raoul eto   and word and word  maybe four words raoul was brought in and and brought out  why is there no blood at all on the sole or on   on the top of the shoe of frank wasylesko not even a  word   one would think that if frank wasylesko was even holding him down while other people were kicking him there's going to be splatters somewhere on the wall or on the floor   there's gonna going to be splatters on the shoe  there's gonna going to be some objective evidence which would point to what raoul eto is saying  people would've walked at or near or in that pool of blood and there'd be footprints of blood word but there isn't  there is absolutely no evidence that that pool of blood is disturbed in any way  it would have to have been   word that raoul eto is   is getting beaten as he suggested he was there has to be some indication one or two words spread out that  there was somebody had walked in it  constable reif saw except for that pool of blood nothing else nothing else which would indicate at all uhm  that the fact that there had been this big uh beating going on in the back room  certainly when he goes in he goes in because raoul eto   three words   sentence   now here's another interesting thought   raoul eto suggests that charles is being kicked only in the midsection  not in the face not in the upper chest area not in the legs but in the midsection   can't he cover himself up with his arms   is it not more maybe two words curious   that charles' fresh cut the one that he had recently  stitched on his arm physically still healing by the way   a few words had not been reinjured a few words  quite a few words there's no bruising on the arm  and in fact raoul eto had suggested that one of the groups had actually hit his arm   two words no evidence whatsoever of bruising on charles montebank's arms or back at that particular a few words   is it not two words very convenient that  raoul eto had suggested that charles is only being kicked  word   raoul's getting it from everywhere according to himself   he was getting kicked in the head the back of the head the upper shoulder area but charles is only getting kicked in the stomach   is he suggesting three words to you that  charles was complaining about a stomach problem and therefore they would  kick on him in that area   i suggest it's very convenient that raoul eto suggests  that charles was being kicked in that area because ultimately it was shown that charles had a pancreas problem and it's easy to  say he was kicked there but there's no evidence of kicking anywhere else  there's no evidence of bruising on the ribs   there's no evidence of bruising in the upper chest area  and i already covered that  there's no evidence of bruising on the word   there's evidence of some marks on his shoulder and i believe some indication that he might have had the next day have developed a black eye  that's it  there's no evidence otherwise of any kicks or abrasions or  or bruising to the body   does that indicate  why is there no evidence  maybe three words rely on what raoul eto  says to the police  he's word beaten up two words  the police are already there  the police are there  they can they can secure it  if i was being beaten up a few words   would i not be up on my feet and saying this these  guys beat me up him him and him  nothing  nothing's said at all  raoul left   why doesn't reif notice charles montebank  bent over complaining about his stomach   there's no indication that reif three words  no indication that reif noticed anything untoward about  charles montebank   heck no indication that he even paid any attention to charles montebank   charles montebank's not complaining about his stomach  he's not yelling at the cops at all  he's not yelling at reif saying come help me my stomach's hurt or these guys hit me in my stomach   this i suggest ladies and gentlemen is not uhm it it it's not consistent with anything going on in the hallway   and if they fail ed to prove the guilt of him beyond a reasonable doubt then you must acquit  i'm now going to deal with peter four or five words   if you accept his evidence in support of   of the defence and all the other testimonies four or five words that the sexual assault i e having anal intercourse with sarah did not take place you must return a verdict of not guilty   if you do not accept the evidence in support of the defence maybe a word sexual assault did not take place but you are left in reasonable doubt by it then you must also return a verdict of not guilty even if you are only two or three words    and again what i said word roger  is equally applicable even if you are not left in a reasonable doubt by the evidence in support of the defence that the sexual assault did not take place you must still go on to determine from all the evidence whether or not the accused is guilty  in other words i again remind you that the crown must in our legal system prove each and every ingredient of the offence necessary to sustain the charge beyond a reasonable doubt  and if you're satisfied that they have then two or three words guilty  as i said earlier the crown must establish the guilt of the accused  to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and if the crown failed to prove [ 47.00] the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt then you must acquit  now i'm going to deal with the last accused and that becomes a little more complicated because there was the case against mr childs word call him  matthew is that he word or aided the other two accused   so i will now tell you about the law of aiding and abetting with respect to matthew   in this case the crown says that matthew <,. is  guilty of the offence because he aided either roger or  peter to commit the offence of sexual assault ##yes##  section twenty-one-two of the criminal code states that a person may be convicted as a party to an offence where he or she aids it says  aids and abets but abets doesn't apply in this case whether or not he or she aids someone else to commit the offence ##yes##  it is up for you ##yes## to decide whether or not matthew aided or abbetted either  roger or peter in the commission of the offence of sexual assault   therefore it is my duty to explain the law to you so that you can make this decision  first i will read section twenty-one-one in the criminal code to you and i will explain what it means   second i will list the elements the crown must prove before you are allowed to convict matthew [ 48.30] of being a party to the sexual assault by aiding roger or peter   section twenty-one-one of the criminal code reads judge reads from criminal code for approximately fifteen seconds   that section is very straightforward   it says that a person who actually commits an offence is guilty of that offence   i'll refer to that person who actually commits an offence as the  principal offender   in this case the crown takes the position that roger  and peter are the principal offenders and therefore section twenty-one-one b and c are the paragraphs that deal with aid  essentially they say that someone who aids a principal offender to commit an offence is a party to the offence  under our law a person who is a party to an offence is just as guilty as the principal offender [ 49.30]   that is really what those sections say   that if you aid the principal offender and he's guilty  then that person is also guilty   i will now tell you the elements that the crown must prove before you can find matthew guilty of sexual assault  there are three of them  the crown must prove each of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt  first the crown must prove that either roger or   peter committed the offence of sexual assault  if they're both found not guilty then that's the end of the case  as far as uh matthew is concerned   second the crown must prove that matthew did accompany and this actually aided either roger or peter  to commit the offence of sexual assault  the evidence in court here the defence evidence is that uh  that uh he didn't do it at all [ 50.30]  if you accept that or you have a reason to doubt that he didn't uh  open this girl's legs then that evidence alone you would have to  acquit #yes#  that's if you've ever if you accept  his evidence or you have a reasonable doubt whether he did it  third the crown must prove that matthew intended that his act would aid either roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault   the first element the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt and i mentioned that before is that either roger or  peter committed the offence of sexual assault   and of course this is if they haven't  that's the end of the case against against  matthew and you have to find him not guilty   the second element that the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that matthew did something and that act  actually ##not rep/incomplete+complete## aided either roger or peter  to commit sexual assault [ 51.40]  now the word aid has an ordinary english meaning  that means to help or  assist   there are a number of ways in which a person can help or assist another to commit an offence   for example the aider can supply the principal offender with the instruments needed for committing the offence 
Canada	 thank you my lord uh   if i may   well i have could be 'had' a actually i'll do this first i think  uh in response to the crown and the crown's position and if i may i'd like to suggest that if i listen to the crown's theory and the crown's position on this quite frankly my lord it is indeed a tale well told but a tale nonetheless  and there's some fundamental problems that   i'm not gonna going to take much of your time  i'm gonna going to take about fifteen minutes of the time in responding because i i made a great number of notes and i wanted to be sure that i totally understood  the position of the matter  i think i do  and i know that of course that we're gonna  going to overlook all the hyperboles  the law and word springfield and the  second and cash related word aren't particularly important to us   which is more that what the evidence has told us  there's one fatal flaw my lord in the crown's whole theory and it's this  it's that the crown says that they're not relying on one overall  progenous plan in effect  but as i listen could be 'listened' to my friend very able submission very articulate submission  there's absolutely no doubt that this is one overall progenous  plan  and the problem though is is as follows  there are seven or eight as you will've noticed significant time points on the time chronology that mr kent has forward for you  at each of those times there comes a point where mr luthor   such as tools for breaking into a house   or they may act as a lookout ready to warn the others of the approach   or they may assist the principal offender by being there  and helping them in when they are committing the offence   you therefore must decide whether the act of matthew  aided either roger or peter in the extent of assistance helping facilitating or making it easier for either  roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault   you can find that matthew 's conduct aided either  roger or peter even if either roger and  peter could've committed the offence without his act  it is sufficient that matthew 's conduct assisted  facilitated or made it easier for the offence to be offended    now i'm just gonna going to very briefly touch on the evidence which you must consider word  whether or not the crown has proved that matthew did something  and that act aided roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault  and you first of all word i mentioned earlier you have to consider his evidence he denied the count  if you accept that evidence or you have a reasonable doubt then he has to be acquitted including five or six words   one of them convicted   but the evidence of the crown is sarah said that the accused matthew came into the bedroom and on one occasion  pulled her legs apart  she said that once   but in cross-examination she said she thought it was  matthew   on another occasion she said he tried to grab my legs  and pull them apart but i wouldn't let him   so you have slightly different versions going through all that evidence  and of course you have matthew 's evidence where he denies that that happened   i should also emphasize that both aiding means more than just standing by and watching someone commit an offence   mere presence at the scene of an offence is not sufficient to make a person an aider  an onlooker is not an aider unless he or she actually encourages  or does something to help criminal offence  therefore in order to prove the second element the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that matthew did something and that act actually aided roger and peter to commit  or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault  the third element the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that matthew intended to aid roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault   now in this case there is evidence word   that either roger or peter personally committed the offence of sexual assault   now you might be satisfied insofar as matthew is concerned  that first of all that either   i want to emphasize this that either roger or  peter committed the offence and that matthew  assisted   for either then you must convict both of them  they are equally guilty regardless of which one was the actual perpetrator and which one was the aider or abetter  but again i wanna want to emphasize that if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that matthew  aided either of these two accused as i have defined it for you then you must find not guilty  now ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is a very serious charge and you have very solemn duties and responsibilities  you have a duty to the crown and you have a duty to all  five or six words   you have taken an oath to try the charge on the evidence without  either fear or favour and surrender a true verdict   two or three words you will have performed your duties fully  now in closing i want to leave this message with you  you've heard me say this over and over again and i'll mention it one last time  that every ingredient necessary to sustain the charge against each of the accused must be proved by the crown beyond a reasonable doubt   with respect to each ingredient every ingredient there's no obligation on the accused whatsoever  now when you go into that jury room i want you to read them together and use your good old-fashioned common sense and take whatever time you need to reach your verdict until you are all each and every one of you satisfied with it   if you have any questions i want you to put them in writing and give them to the foreperson that you have chosen  he's in charge of the jury  and that writing will be drawn to my attention  then i'll spend some time considering questions with which you need help   i'll review them with counsel and then i'll call you back  and i'm quite prepared to deal with the questions and any other problems that you may have   if anything i have said to you is unclear or you wish  further instructions do not hesitate to ask  now when you leave i'm going to ask the court counsel here  whether i've understated or overstated or simply made a mistake in respect of my charge  and it may well be that i will call you back for further directions  after i 've canvassed all court counsellors  if i do that there may be a danger that you will place too much emphasis on what i say at that time than what i just told you in in in during my address  please don't do that  should i recall you you must consider what i say in the light of what i'm telling saying to you now  with that ladies and gentlemen of the jury i'm going to ask  the the sheriff's officer to swear   one or two words that he's going to be responsible for your care  thank you very much and go ahead and try to five or six words   is frank still guilty   if if he did participate in the  beating in that hallway  if he'd held raoul down while charles was being kicked if he himself punched raoul frank woulda  would've known  i've done something wrong here   word reif come in what does  frank do  sentence   he then takes a tour with name cos no one's been looking after riley's and a hundred and fifty patrons all of a sudden   a short tour and comes back  if you feel guilty wouldn't you wanna  want to stay there to ensure that people one or two words  the allegations and tell word my story  hey this guy beat me   and then frank would say no no i didn't  why did he take off  why did he go around and then come back   it's just completely inconsistent with a guilty person's conduct within the staff two or three words   if you're going to be clear that up until the night  four or five words raoul eto the doormen  simply wanted to get raoul word out of  word   no questions asked  there's no indication that they wanted to harm these people  there's no indication that they wanted to take any particular vengeance out on raoul and and  richard and andrew and and  charles they just simply want to get them out of riley's for their hundred and fifty patrons   they're doing their job   all the word according to the evidence of  raoul eto and charles montebank four or five words  and these four accused turned in a vicious attack   that was their suggestion that they turned just like that  they ran out there and they beat raoul eto mercilessly  they did it in a back hallway word a bathroom  sounds a lot to me ladies and gentlemen like the  guys are under a lot of stress  they're angry and upset  on the night involved they're gonna going to   go over the limit  they're gonna going to take their vengeance out   i suggest that word very very unusual behaviour for essentially three of them uh doormen  they know what they're doing   they don't wanna want to have any trouble with anybody they just simply want everything peaceful  two or three words   there's a similar why do  four clean-cut decent kids with good academic records good work records some of them holding down two jobs all of a sudden at one collective time all together turn into two or three words  is that unusual  i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen maybe a word or hesitation of the jury that it's very unusual  utterance   they're just doing their jobs  they're trying to do it the best way that they know how  if however that causes a lot of assault going on   six to eight words sentence word    these are just eight youths  four or five words that i would  uh that i wouldn't have to concentrate on several words   i'd also like to deal for a short moment here with the instances we've seen in the evidence itself  these aren't in instances  of common sense but rather dealing with the differences in the crown's evidence   the majority of the crown's witnesses ladies and gentlemen  to varying degrees had consumed quantities of alcohol of various kinds  utterance   uh we have margaritas   we have shooters  we have free beer  a lot of free beer one or two words between nine and ten o'clock  except for tom jones and don maller the other friends of raoul eto including raoul eto himself were drinking possibly two words, very quiet   they were drunk  any suggestion ladies and gentlemen that they weren't drunk or they weren't intoxicated or gee you know i can handle myself with  beer   these guys had a lot to drink  these people were uhm were out for a good time  look how much drink between nine and ten and they were going  to realize it   you've heard the evidence of tim makinski of john sawyer going out and back along one or two words   to cash in his money and cash word   this is consistent with people who want to have a good time   now it does not take medical evidence to convince  people that consumption of alcohol has many effects on the mind  firstly it dulls the memory  recollection is two or three words   secondly it affects your perception of what's going on around you  fantasy becomes reality and reality becomes word  the concept of time and place actually become warped   thirdly you become less inhibited than you were when you were sober  all three of those effects of alcohol apply to this case    the difficulty of word is that word  rely in large part on the recollection of the individuals who were drunk or intoxicated  after three or four words i was still at a loss as to exactly what happened on the evening of september thirteenth september fourteenth   i i must've heard ten different versions of exactly what happened  i didn't know  it was only until the defence actually took the stand who put the puzzle together   who put it all together although there were some maj  some major inconsistencies but they made  it it sound sounds reasonable and logical as to what happened   the doormen weren't drunk  two or three words their job  and and word  tell word exactly what happened on that night  word it's perhaps a word  the first time that any of them had ever been arrested for doing anything wrong two or three words   i wanna want to draw to your attention several observations that i have listed five or six words  you would also have other other things or other questions that might be going on in your mind five or six words

before nine  coming up next samuel derry   ten minutes now before nine here on daybreak  you've been hearing on world report throughout the morning about the galileo space probe  we've been hearing from doug mackenzie who is of course the host of quirks and quarks the national science program on c b c  canadian broadcasting corporation radio "
Canada	"   well doug we squashed doug's little account of what's going on there with galileo into one of those little one minute news reports but we've got a little bit more of him explaining  just what galileo is and what the scientists hope they're going to get back from it   galileo is a product of the time that astronomers call the golden age of planetary exploration  back in the nineteen sixties and seventies when budgets were higher  a fleet of intelligent sophisticated robots were sent out to survey the solar system  and there were always two  viking one and two went to mars orbited the planet mapped it then sent landers down on the surface that tasted the soil looked for life took full colour stereo pictures  voyager one and two did the grand tour of the solar system visiting jupiter saturn uranus and neptune  and seeing more than fifty moons along the way  many that had never even been seen before  galileo was to be the next step  it was to go to jupiter and stay there  orbit the planet  look at it over a long period of time and for the first time  sample that atmosphere  send a probe right down into it  well with budget cuts and all of the other economic realities that hit nasa there was only one galileo  so the astronomers were forced to put all of their eggs in one basket  and because of that it's been a frustratingly long wait for them  right from the beginning galileo was delayed  if it had gone according to its original schedule it would have already been over ten years ago  it was supposed to fly in nineteen eighty-two and it was only supposed to take two years to get to jupiter  well delays in the program put it back to nineteen eighty-six  then the challenger disaster with the space shuttle which blew up  that put the program back to nineteen eighty-nine  by that time they had to find a different way of going to jupiter  one that took six years instead of two  so for some of the astronomers who've been working on this program they've been waiting almost eighteen years for this one mission  and for those who've been waiting for the data from the probe  all of that wait comes down to just over an hour  seventy-five minutes is the only time that that probe is going to be sending back data before it's crushed by that jupiter atmosphere  and even after the spacecraft was on its way there had been problems that have plagued the poor galileo spacecraft  its main antenna which unfolds like a big umbrella got caught on a metal strap so it doesn't have the proper shape to be able to send signals at the earth  so they have to use a very slow back up antenna  and they had to cut down the number of pictures down from fifty thousand that they were hoping to take down to maybe three or four thousand  at the same time they've had to rely on a tape recorder that  can store the data and send it back at this slow rate  and the tape recorder jammed and almost broke so now they're being very ginger with that to make sure that it works  but even though it's had its delays and had its problems and it's had frustrations and everyone is biting their nails as it finally gets to jupiter galileo has done some remarkable things  while it was on its way to jupiter it took the very first movie  of the earth turning  which is a rather remarkable thing when you think about it  we'd never seen the earth turn  we'd seen it from space but never actually moving  galileo did that  it also saw the first asteroids  we'd known they had been out there  we've never seen them close up  it passed two of them on the way here and even found a little tiny moon going around an asteroid  a total surprise to everyone  and while the amount of data galileo brings back might be limited  it's still exciting because we've never been inside jupiter  for me i've been there throughout this entire exploration of the solar system  i've seen the pict pictures  tape cut out live from the planets and seen worlds that have never been seen by human eyes  and you relate to these spacecraft almost like pets  they're out there in this very hostile environment  they have a hard time  you hope they survive and you kind of encourage them on  come on galileo you can make it you can do it you can go there  so i wish galileo well and hope it succeeds in its mission  that's doug mackenzie host of quirks and quarks our national science program here on c b ra c b c radio    that can be heard every saturday right after the noon news weather and sports uhh right after well it's nine minutes a nice package of information there and then quirks and quarks comes on with doug mackenzie  here on c b c nine forty in montreal   ah canadiens are playing in pittsburgh tonight so the test continues for them  and we keep saying that and it would have been a test for mario tremblay anyway with patrick roy in the line up had they gotten along famously  fact is they're not  they're facing mario lemieux tonight in pittsburgh  should be a very tough game for montreal  patrick roy will probably get the start for the avalanche tonight  they are at home against the edmonton oilers  and the avalanche play very well at home  they've only lost once

today in brampton ontario  ninety men and fifteen women will try and qualify for the team canada that goes to the nineteen ninety-six atlanta olympics  and canada's top sprinters have agreed to run in the hamilton indoor games next month  that includes montreal's bruny surin  that starts january twelfth  the meet uh in montreal will be uh on the nineteenth of january  well it's supposed to be the end of the rush hour but it doesn't look that way from the uhh problems that we have  d&eacute;carie southbound a stall in the lefthand lane at jean-talon  metropolitan westbound a couple of stalled vehicles there as well  left hand lane just before d&eacute;carie circle  and another one also left lane just before veuillot  and the met westbound is pretty much bumper to bumper all the way from the anjou interchange to d&eacute;carie circle  highway twenty westbound that accident was cleared away and it is uhh working much better than it was before so you should have less trouble getting out to the airport  uh the mercier bridge we have an accident just reported on the span there  so uh not uh not a good end to the rush hour  the champlain though has cleared out fairly nicely  cost you about ten minutes there  same thing for the victoria  though coming off the victoria bridge you will find things slow if you decide to get on the bonaventure because we have the uh sun youth doing a collection of donations along with the m u c police at the corner of saint-antoine and university  and that is backing things on to the bonaventure  and one last look at thirteen southbound and yes they did arrest a motorist there for driving with a dummy in the passanger seat  and you would think thousands of people would get arrested if that were the case and they did it everyday  but you're not supposed to do that in the reserved lane on the thirteen southbound  you have to have a real person in the passenger seat and you have to be at least two people in your car   it's three minutes now before nine and ah once again forecast high today probably minus two  should see quite a bit of sunshine in the course of the day  overnight tonight it's gonna going to  get cold down to minus fifteen  lots of sunshine for tomorrow but cool temperatures  minus eight the forecast high for tomorrow  some snow on the way for saturday  not clear yet how much at this point  it looks like not very much  that could change  keep listening  and for sunday a mixture of sun and cloud with a high around minus three  let's listen to a little more of danielle martineau in a style we'd be maybe more expecting from her song   you're listening to daybreak on c b c nine forty in montreal  good morning i'm johnny gore   thanks for joining us this morning  cool out there  minus seven  the skies are quite clear though  at least  throughout the day we'll be expecting a mixture of sun and cloud this thursday the seventh of december intro music   skies clearing out overnight tonight completely  temperatures dropping down as low as minus fifteen  we're ah heading towards a cold and sunny day tomorrow  sunshine with a high of only minus eight  we're expecting a high of it could get up   to minus two for midtown montreal  uh but generally minus five that kind of thing  so it's not going to be a great great day  uhh for the weekend and of course the weekend is in the forecast at this point we're talking about a little bit of snow for saturday  at this point they're saying at least five centimeters  maybe more depending on on how the system develops  but we should see a bit of sunshine on sunday  variable cloudiness for sunday  uhh highs around minus three minus four for the weekend  fourteen minutes now after seven  and let's go out into traffic right away with peter larue

quebec city  now the owner of les nordiques daniel marchand is in new york  but leona davis has spoken to a team representative  she is on the line with us  leona   yes hi bill uhm  i spoke with john letourneau who's a spokesman for the team here in quebec city  uhm hmm  and he wouldn't say that it was game over as far as negotiations but he really talks as though in terms of   the very slimmest opening  and it all hinges on that meeting between daniel marchand  the president of the nordiques and jacques parizeau where they would discuss this question of the casino  now jacques parizeau has said no in two ways  he has said first of all that the the  matter of the casino is not his alone to decide but it's a government decision  and he's also said that he has mandated joel tessier uhm to be a negotiator in this affair and so he sees no need to meet directly with marchand on this sort of question  so this looks very much as though things are going down the  train drain on that  and letourneau says that this offer from the government was clearly insufficient  he reiterated their three demands which is the new arena uhm secondly uh help in covering the uh interim financing for the team while there is construction of that new arena  there its deficit could be ten or twelve million over the next two years and he says that would sink the team  if it if it isn't covered  they would go bankrupt  and then also the question of long-term financing through something like the casino  and letourneau says they have gathered seventy-five thousand signatures on a petition that they'll be handed in to the national assembly tomorrow and he says that's proof enough that those'd be the kind of people who'd be paying money at the casino to help support the nordiques and so the government should be uh getting behind that sort of will  so we wait and see then leona   thank you very much  you're welcome  the mont word regional health board has announced its own set of cuts for the next three years  they're chopping their budget by about five million dollars  shifting money away from hospitals towards ambulatory care  melissa pettifer has more  the cuts to the health care budget for the area south of montreal are not as serious as the ones on the island  with a population of one point three million people the mont  word works with a budget of just under a billion dollars  now they need to cut a net amount of five million dollars  investing in the prevention and promotion of health is their main goal and like montreal they're veering towards ambulatory care by investing fifteen million in outpatient care  that's the upside  the downside is the board will close two hundred acute care beds  and one hundred people will lose their jobs over the next three years  henri gagnon is director general of the board  he says in deciding who gets what money their goal was to establish no quality of services throughout the system and to reward efficiency  we can say who has uh work to do to uh to obtain the objectives that we have set  we will want to uhm uh make sure that the good managers uh come out the winners in this kind of an approach  the health board will work with a variety of partners including c l s cs centre local de services communautaires  school boards and other ministries to implement the cuts  melissa pettifer c b c news longueuil  quebec's health minister jean rochon says the equivalent of two thousand more hospital beds will be available for elderly patients needing long-term care  half the spaces will be created by transforming existing facilities  the other half will require new construction by nineteen ninety-seven  rochon says this plan should help people understand his aim is not simply to shut down hospitals  the real exercise which is going to be on is that we are redeploying redeveloping part of our system to to  make a modern system out of it  we have a very good system  but if we leave it as it is and go like that over the next five years we will have an a downgraded system because we will not spend the money in the kind of services that are most needed for by the population   canada at five  good afternoon  i'm linda clark   the president of the quebec nordiques say the owners have decided that the team has to be sold  daniel marchand says the quebec government has not made an offer that is good enough to keep the n h l national hockey league  team in quebec city  the province had said it was willing to cover up to twenty-one million dollars in team losses for the next three years  in the meantime it would study whether the team needs a new twenty thousand seat arena  but marchand says that isn't enough  the nordiques want the new arena built right away and the owners want a casino included in the building with all the profits going to the team  marchand has asked to meet with premier parizeau in a final bid to come up to come to a deal to keep the team in quebec city  the conservative majority in the senate says the chr&eacute;tien government is moving in the right direction but the tories are being coy about whether they'll end their opposition to bill c twenty-two  that's the legislation that will kill the agreement to privatize pearson airport  the tory senators have been stonewalling the bill because they say it restricts the airport developers from suing for damages  in a bid to break the stalemate the government has agreed to certain changes in the legislation  but even with the proposed amendments the conservative leader in the senate says the bill still denies the developers rights enjoyed by convicted criminals  adam carter reports  justice minister alan rock went before a senate committee today in an effort to persuade his tory critics that the government acknowledges that the pearson bill has its flaws and is trying to improve it  people can't get the code after june thirtieth  here's a change that'll allow them to do so  people can't recover expenses incurred after june thirtieth  here's a change that'll allow them to do so  you think there should be actions for defamation  help yourself  those are the changes  but rock stood firm on the government's policy not to compensate the developers for lobbying fees or for lost profits because the pearson contract is not going ahead  this is a horrendous piece of legislation  john lynch staunton is the tory leader in the senate  he says even with rock's proposed changes the bill is still discriminatory and punitive  in canada we allow serial murderers we allow convicted rapists we allow repeat offenders we allow petty thieves the full protection of the court system and the full protection of the law  and in this unprecedented piece of legislation full access to the courts is still being denied them under these amendments  outside the committee though lynch staunton admitted that with the proposed amendments the government is moving to satisfy some of the legal and constitutional objections to the pearson bill  but he says the tories will wait until they have heard from legal experts before they decide whether to end their ten month long campaign against the legislation and finally allow it to pass  adam carter c b c news ottawa  the head of the c r t c canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission says he has an idea that would help

watch the french news with no distraction  it would be only french  but if you wanted the english news you could see it with a french translation  and vice versa any kind of i think uh   that suggestion could do more for uh intercultural understanding than anything i can think of  right on target and uh uh i think we have to give mister beatty a few weeks to uh catch his breath but i can

Canada	 good morning  i'm gus mcbain   and i'm julie maverins   this is world report  in the news today bedlam at queens park  the opposition stages an all-night protest in the ontario legislature  forgive us our sins churches apologize to native groups for residential schools  and rendez-vous with jupiter the galileo space probe ends a six year journey through space  it has been a very long night at the ontario legislature  about a dozen opposition members are gathered around a liberal member to prevent the sergeant-at-arms from removing him from the chamber  yesterday the speaker ordered liberal m p p member of the provincial parliament alvin curling expelled when he refused to vote on a bill  that's a violation of house rules  as phil hastings reports the controversial bill from the conservative government is at the centre of the political storm  the flashpoint for the opposition's anger is the bill the harris government says it must pass to implement the six billion dollar spending cut it announced last week  but the opposition says this is much more than money bill  among other things they say it gives the government the right to redraw municipal boundaries and even look at people's private medical records  they accuse harris of trying to ram through a huge chunk of his legislative agenda all at once so unpopular policies could be slipped by without debate  the opposition's price for ending what has effectively become a sit-in is for the government to break the bill down into several smaller bills then submit the pieces to extensive public hearing  conservative house leader ernie eaves says he's willing to negotiate but  i'm not going to do it while they are holding the legislative assembly hostage and while they refuse to complete a vote  i mean this is an affront to parliamentary democracy as we know it  liberal leader lynne mcleod says alvin curling and the opposition are willing to stay put until eaves agrees to public hearing  that is not asking a lot of a government that is making sweeping and fundamental changes that give them incredible powers  close to thirty m p p's from both sides sat through the night  some read and some slept some did their christmas cards  once every hour conservative members held up posters of a dollar sign  the tories claim every hour the bill to cut government spending is delayed a million dollars in interest is added to the ontario debt  phil hastings c b c news toronto  canadian soldiers will soon be heading back to bosnia  the first of up to a thousand troops will begin leaving for the balkans before christmas  they'll become part of the multi-national force of sixty thousand from nato  canada's defence minister says a thousand soldiers will satisfy nato commanders  but some military analysts disagree devon asper has more  canada had been asked to contribute a larger force of up to sixteen hundred  but defence minister david collenette insists canada's contribution will please nato headquarters in brussels  this is uhh within the acceptable range that we had been discussing with the nato commanders  i think they'll be quite happy  and collenette says canadians will be pleased as well  it goes without saying that canadians would expect us  to uh if we're part of the nato organization to be there  especially at this historic time when uh nato in effect  is changing its direction after forty years and take on a very meaningful security role  but some defence analysts believe canada is taking the easy way out  i would have hoped for a a much more substantial contribution   don jorgenson is a retired colonel and former editor of the canadian defence quarterly  jorgenson says canada could have done more it should have done more  i wonder how much our contribution is going to matter  and i think that needs to be a matter of something  accounted for us   we wanted to contribute to something uh to an operation where it made a difference  the commitment to the peace process in bosnia will cost canadian tax payers just under fifty million dollars  collenette says the canadian soldiers will stay in bosnia for one year and then come home  devon asper c b c news ottawa  paul martin has set a new target for federal deficit reduction  the finance minister said yesterday he intends to slash the deficit to two percent of gross domestic product by nineteen ninety-seven  that means a deficit of about seventeen billion dollars  half of what it is today  but as joanne murphy reports the reform party says the target is still too high  everybody agree with the the  objective of uh uh reducing uh deficit of federal government  actually it's rare to get agreement on something in ottawa  but yvan loubier of the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois  says everyone wants deficit reduction  the problem is there's no consensus on the pace of cutting back  finance minister paul martin says he's moving as fast as he can  a single-minded dash to a zero deficit would be counterproductive in every sense  but don't say that to preston manning of the reform party  he's not impressed with the new target  and he's repeating what has become a mantra for reform  i think you know what we're going to say  and that is that you are not going far enough fast enough  with respect to spending reduction  but other reform members seem almost surprised that martin is moving so fast  his finance critic herb grubel says most of the cuts from the last budget have yet to work their way through the system  so it'll be quite the challenge to slash even more  i can just envision the pressures that are going to build up and what you will have to face  canadians don't yet know the specifics of what they'll face in further cutbacks  for details they'll have to wait until february for the next budget  joanne murphy c b c news ottawa  the investigation into the airbus scandal has been stalled by a legal challange launched

demonstrates that there is a place for aboriginal justice in canada  we're trying to make the system work for murray teller and for the community that will help our first nations people straighten out

an agent for many of the game's top stars  now this will be the first public airing of those allegations against eagleson in canada but as adam bach reports it may not get very far  the law society complaint alleges professional misconduct by eagleson and conduct unbecoming a solicitor  the complaint is a lengthy one it's seventeen pages  in it eagleson is accused of such things as loaning players association money without getting consent and of deliberately misleading certain players including former hockey great bobby orr  the complaint says orr could have become a part owner of the boston bruins but his agent at the time alan eagleson didn't tell him  the law society set aside three weeks to hear from players like orr  and to hear other legal arguments to decide if eagleson should be disciplined he could be disbarred  but the hearing may not last long  eagleson's lawyer daniel kingsman wants it delayed  eagleson faces serious criminal charges in the u s including fraud racketeering and embezzlement and he could be extradited to face those charges soon  daniel kingsman says that has to be dealt with first  that eagleson should have his day in court in the u s before

the list  a gold and silver going to our hundred metre sprinters now the bronze  and there's a chance for more medals on the way  for instance angela chalmers from victoria has qualified for the final in the women's fifteen hundred metres despite the fact that she's had problems with asthma during her stay in sweden  and angela chalmers here describes her strategy for tomorrow's final  the priority in the final will be to race up to my potential on the day  uhm and to come away from it learning something and to come away from it having enjoyed my experience here  it's been rough to enjoy it this time because i've been struggling so much  and i think that i i you know i can't deny that i'm a real competitor and seeing donovan win the other day was just you know i just sort of had to go wow that must be so incredible i wish i could do that  but you know it's his time and i'm i'm   just gonna going to have to focus on doing my best  and and however that is it's   gonna going to be enough  however while angela chalmers has advanced to the race for the medals fellow canadian leah pells from coquitlam b c was left behind in the fifteen hundred and pells talks about her semi-final  i think it was just a very very tough race  there was uh it was very very aggressive  there was a lot of pack running a lot of getting slammed around and it tends to be almost more uh emotionally draining than physically draining   and you know physically it's almost most   athletes can find it and it's the emotional part you know like  you you just get it hammered right out of you  and in the last home stretch i'm telling you i gave it every single ounce within me and that was all that there was and i'm disappointed that i couldn't find more  really disappointed  well that's part of sports but

help towns that suffered the loss of their main industries are doing little to help people in these communities cope with the crisis  that's what delegates attending a national conference in saint john's heard today  lilly powell says counsellors working with struggling communities have to learn to be patient and they have to allow people themselves come up with ideas for their future on their own terms  lauren callaghan reports  lilly powell has spent the last ten years looking at communities in crisis in newfoundland  but she says what she's learned applies to any town in canada that has lost its major industry  she says many government programs set up to help dying communities don't work   that's because they often don't identify the strength of these communities  instead they push people into doing things that they're either not ready for or don't meet their needs  in many cases she says dying towns are urged to draw in new business become competitive  but what many really need is a cooperative approach that involves other communities in the region  she says communities need time to sort things out on their own terms not on a government-driven schedule  and it's difficult because funding and certainly in terms of efficiency we do have you know shrinking budgets so it's very very difficult  marvin chalk knows exactly what powell means  he's the mayor of fortune a community of twenty-two hundred on the burin peninsula in newfoundland  five months ago the fish plant the town's largest employer  shut down throwing hundreds of people out of work  and while the workers are receiving government compensation  chalk says it's not enough  it certainly isn't the answer and that adage that give them the money and they'll be happy that's not true  but chalk admits right now people in his community aren't ready to accept a future without the fish plant  they need time to absorb what has happened and to realize that things will have to change  powell says what counsellors in communities like fortune have to do is offer support and guidance not directive   she says towns have to sort out their own priorities on their own terms and community development workers should merely try to help them along that road   lauren callaghan c b c news saint john's  as many as nine-hundred-thousand canadians who own japanese-built cars will receive voluntary recall

unassisted uh   we well actually it was assisted cos of the drive through the mound off the glove of uh butch henry   and he managed to snag the ball that uh trickled to second base touched the bag throw to first for the double play to get henry out of a jam  it was really the only one that he was in in the game cos uhm it was uh first and third at that point for the cubbies  again four to nothing  i spoke with butch henry afterwards  he said what made the game a complete game for him all the more surprising where he only gave up seven hits is that beforehand he just didn't feel that great physically   when i came in today and soaked in the sauna beforehand and uh it just uh you know i got out there in the first inning and i was i was excellent speaks to another person i was real uh real  wired  i do i don't know why i mean  i was i was just out there uh you know uh   everything everything looked like it was going ninety miles an hour and it i i you know i whizzed through that first inning and i was like wow laugh  american   i don't know how i did that   butch henry uh   is is butch an american uh kid  oh laugh he asks facetiously   laugh kinda kind of     yeah uh  and you know the reason why i guess uh he got the nickname butch is because uh i believe his given names are reed bluford actually floyd bluford   i have to check that words   i'd take butch   you'd take butch over those then   i'd take butch  you betcha  so good news uh for the expos and their fans because uh   five hundred   five hundred  they are uh seven and two on that homestand  they go to

from the west island you'll find trans canada-highway twenty are working well  c&ocircumflex;te de liesse also looks good and the metropolitan works well in both directions  thanks cam   good morning  i'm sean dowell with the c b c news for quebec  premier parizeau says he'll release a document today that proves ottawa is trying to get the other provinces to urge quebecers to vote no in the referendum  the premier says he still plans to attend next month's  premiers' conference in st john's newfoundland unless other provinces join in a common front against quebec  we get more in this report from tricia langbein   parizeau has a few story ideas for journalists that don't involve lobsters reference to parizeau's alleged comments that a yes vote will be like throwing lobsters into boiling water   he wants to know if a common front is being organized by other premiers against quebec  he points the finger at federal cabinet minister lucienne robillard  is it true that mrs robillard has asked mr filmon ah some weeks ago to build a sort of common front of nine provinces  that would say to quebecers a we love you b vote no and we'll change things but we won't tell you until afterwards   parizeau alleges the premier of manitoba gary filmon approached several premiers on this topic  they included newfoundland premier clyde wells who said he would have no part of this common front  tricia langbein   c b c news quebec city  lucienne robillard says parizeau's allegation is  hogwash really unbelievable   she says she spoke to filmon about national unity issues but she didn't mention any common front against quebec  she says it's normal for ottawa to have contact with all the provinces   representatives from kahnawake and akwesasne will be in kanesatake today  kahnawake's grand chief tim horten says the mohawk leaders will be discussing the marijuana growing at kanesatake and the lack of policing there  he's urging the federal and provincial governments to reconsider a plan to send trained mohawk peacekeepers into the community  he says the peacekeepers could provide immediate much-needed stability  i think the majority of the people in that community  have very legitimate concerns about ahh the issue of law and order in the community  and i'm not saying it's a lawless community or anything like that  but it is sort of in a in a vacuum  horten says there will always be people willing to exploit a vacuum like the people growing the marijuana  the s q has been reluctant to intervene in kanesatake since the nineteen ninety oka crisis  the band council has set up a community watch team but some people say it's little more than an early warning system in case of a police raid   the province's consumer protection office has tested eighty brands of hot dogs and there were problems with almost half of them  it found more than a million bacteria per gram in levitz  all beef hot dogs schneider's lifestyle hot dogs and thai fair all beef hot dogs  an article in the august issue of protect yourself magazine shows some samples yielded one hundred million bacteria per gram  there was nothing wrong with budget korsch all beef and high grade all beef dogs   health officials in sherbrooke are reassuring people they don't have to worry about getting lyme disease  a report last week said at least three people in the area had been bitten by ticks  fran macintosh has the story  french speech in background   doctor laura renault worked the weekend shift in the emergency room at sherbrooke's h&ocircumflex;tel-dieu  hospital  she says people kept pouring in worried they'd been bitten by ticks carrying lyme disease  they'd read a headline in saturday's newspapers saying the lyme tick had hit the region  at least three people had been bitten and had to be treated within twenty-four hours  dr renault says she ended up examining a lot of mosquito bites  and today the lyme tick threat is hard to trace  the doctor who said he treated the cases is on holidays and no one can reach him  cases like these are usually reported to the regional health board  yet sara martel a public health doctor with the board says there are no details and no proof  it's really uh a non proved cases from the beginning  these kinds of insects are usually analysed at sherbrooke's university hospital  but doctor shaw a microbiologist who works at the hospital says the insects weren't sent to their laboratory  doctor shaw says only one of these ticks has ever been found in the eastern townships  but the fact that it is of the correct species doesn't necessarily mean that it that it was infected with the the bacteria the spirochete that transmits lyme disease  that tick was found last may and he doesn't think it was indigenous  fran macintosh c b c news sherbrooke  montreal's programme aimed at getting people to buy new houses is not getting the response city officials were hoping for  a hundred and forty-five people have filed applications so far  a similar programme last year was much more modest yet it had attracted a thousand applications by the same time last year  people taking advantage of it this year don't have to pay up to ten thousand dollars in taxes over the first two years  an analyst with the city's housing corporation jamie p&eacute;pin says people appear to be worried they could lose their jobs  he says the fluctuations in interest rates aren't helping either  canadian and american pulp and paper companies are looking for reliable supplies of wood  domtar is looking for an alternative  the quebec based company is the first in north america to try making pulp from grass  kelly ulrich reports  it's called agripaper  it's paper made from fibers grown in a field not in a forest  barry thompson hopes it will play an important role in the pulp and paper industry of the future  he's the executive director of reap canada an organization that promotes sustainable agriculture  and he's growing the grass and straw that domtar is turning into pulp and paper  the grasses that we're growing are the fastest growing plants in the world  these grasses are growing about twice as fast as conventional ah crops   and uh they have unique characteristics that make them grow that fast and they're very water efficient  and that's why in this drought year that we've got exceptionally good yields even though it's been one of the driest years in forty years here in quebec  thompson says switch grass in particular can be processed into pulp with fewer chemicals and using less energy than wood  and unlike trees which take decades to grow these grasses can be harvested every year  thompson says alternative fibers can reduce the pressure to cut natural forests  and as a new cash crop these grasses could give farm communities a much-needed boost  while the process is still at the experimental stage domtar hopes to have paper made from grass or straw on the market within a few years  kelly ulrich c b c news montreal  that was the c b c news for quebec   music and dj radio patter   we'll talk to the people from environment canada in just a few minutes  uh but first to find out to see if there's any impact uh on the roads because of this uh wet weather cam jeffrey is here  cam uh any impact yet  impact not a good word  to l to use laugh when we're talking about traffic there kyle   laugh   laugh   no no impact   no collisions  good   no  no impact so far but uh we'll keep an eye out for that  of course do be careful out there this morning uh it is raining a little bit and uh it is slick in spots uh so watch your speed and keep your distance  uh generally the the routes into town from the west island south southshore and laval look good  starting to build a bit at the champlain bridges it usually does  at this time of day but uh nothing serious there  the orange line on the metro line two was closed briefly uh between uh six and six thirty actually just before six thirty but it was reopened quite quickly  and it was closed down between berri and beaubien kyle  because uh apparently somebody blew up a night deposit box in the sherbrooke metro station so the uh police were a little bit concerned there might be other explosives around so they they closed uh the line which is uh becoming a kind of a common practice these days isn't it  hmm not   yeah uh hopefully it won't become too common  uh the less common it is uh the better it is for all of us  word   but it seems that hardly a day goes by when we don't have uhm a suspicious package or something like that going on  a suspicious package somewhere yeah   each week   so that's today's uh  anyway let's hope that's the last one for today and otherwise things look good  okay thanks cam   cam jeffrey will be back uh shortly before seven with another look at what's happening on the roads around montreal and of course on our commuter system  it is now uh ninetee twenty-one   minutes before seven o'clock and we'll be talking about the set point and weight control on the fitness file in just a couple of minutes  but first for the latest on the world of sports here's  xavier roth   good morning   tennis off the top and the men's canadian open in montreal  greg rusedski the canadian who recently became a british citizen was back playing for the first time in canada since moving overseas  not exactly the kind of homecoming he would've liked for a couple of reasons  rusedski lost his opening singles match to american michael joyce in straight sets  but he must've had a hard time concentrating on his game because as marie macdonald reports his reception in montreal was rather frosty tennis commentary in french, people booing   greg rusedski's homecoming was far from friendly yesterday  the former montrealer not only had to face tough competition on the court but an even tougher crowd in the stands at jarry tennis stadium  he was booed as he entered the court booed as he left the court and booed at all times inbetween  the few fans he had were drowned out by the loud boo birds  rusedski says the hostile crowd didn't affect his game though   he just went out and played the best tennis he could with or without support  in fact the booing seemed not to bother him at all  didn't hurt my feelings or didn't hurt hurt  me at all  i mean i i thought that i was  gonna going to get a a  difficult reaction  i kind of expected it so i was prepared for it  i mean it was exciting i mean come on i mean how  how many times have you been to a tennis match and seen so much excitement from controversy going on  good practice for davis cup i guess  although greg rusedski won't be going for the singles title at the canadian open he is still alive in doubles action  it was there that he was able to silence one of his harshest critics  former team mate sebastien lareau is openly critical of rusdeski's decision to play for britain but on the court lareau and his partner leblanc were just two more players for rusedski and wekesa to defeat  they just had to do it without any support from the fans  marie macdonald   c b c sports montreal booing   heh  okay on to hockey news

  good afternoon here's the c b c one o'clock news  the p q parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois  political party says the reversal of referendum vote results in the riding of westmount is not electoral fraud  the vice-president of the party monique simard says the yes committee is not at fault  janet macdonald reports  simard said it was the result of a stupid mistake that caused the yes and no sides to be reversed in the westmont riding  she says it wasn't the fault of the yes committee  but it was an a stupid inversion  that was even overlooked by the no side when it happened  but i presume was corrected after by mister cote's uh counts  simard says she doesn't blame cote for the discrepancies in the referendum results  she says cote was ignored by airline companies and businesses  when he warned them they were violating the referendum budget laws  simard says even yes officials had some serious problems the night of the referendum and the police were called in some instances  many many complaints on irregularities concerning uh  uh people that were impostors  that use another person's identity to vote  uhm other people that would not uh respect a certain number of rules  so i think that ahh it's important that people know that there are complaints everywhere on a certain number of things  simard says cote is the only one who can take any action in dealing with the discrepancies  she says some fifty complaints made by the national yes committee will be made public tomorrow  today is the deadline for a recount of the referendum results by the chief electoral officer pierre f cote  janet macdonald c b c news montreal  the liberal finance critic andre bourbeau says he's not surprised the p q government is proceeding with a one percent increase in the provincial sales tax next year  government officials are blaming cuts in federal transfer payments  but bourbeau says the p q knew cuts were coming  it's funny there all word  provinces canadian provinces were able to uhm balance their budget inspite of the uh cuts in federal transfers and the uh quebec uh p q government uh doesn't seem to uhh uh to be  willing to do the same there  uh they want to uh uh you know to accuse the federal government of the whole responsibility for that  bourbeau says the p q government is reluctant to make the necessary cuts in the civil service because union leaders had supported the sovereignist cause  government officials say the cuts amount to a billion dollar loss in revenues for quebec's nineteen ninety-six ninety-seven budget  the montreal health board is beginning to give details on how it will make up for the closure of seven hospitals  the board is announcing where it reallocate more than one hundred and fifty million dollars over the next three years  john peggoty reports  the board has to find ways of offering elsewhere all the services from end of tape   tape starts mid sentence out who'll join me  fred sayers on the hill  part of the world today weekend edition sunday at noon  right here on newstalk eight hundred c j a d where if you miss a little  i took him out  you miss a lot intro music plays overtop of speaker c   now from the most listened to newsroom in quebec this is news from the source  newstalk eight hundred c j a d montreal  the liberian refugees find a home  the micheal como inquest resumes  the weather not too bad and warming up a little bit  and we get the name of the car bomb victim this morning  in chateauguay  good afternoon  george fraser with news and comments at high noon on a day that is really not bad not bad  it's not exactly hot yet uh but it's getting there  it is warming up  it was below freezing in parts of the laurentiens this morning  so it's uh mostly sunny  there's a bit of cloud but mostly sunny downtown  a bit breezy but not like yesterday  and the tempurature has moved up to thirteen degrees downtown  be a little cooler than that where you are but uh not  bad at all  however we will get some cloud later on today and thursday doesn't look too good  not a bad week though  meantime the car bomb this morning  it happened at about six fifteen  a bomb exploded killing a man driving a car around saint-francis street in chateauguay  right by the zellers store there  we now know his name  his name was gord andrew   a n d r e w  he was thirty-five years old  but police say they know nothing about him  he had no record whatsoever  he was not known to police  so the victim of the car bombing in chateauguay this morning  gord andrew   but all we know about him so far is that he's thirty-five or was thirty-five and did not have a police record  meantime in the laval courthouse this morning the  resumption of the inquest into the death of micheal como   you may recall it was just about a year ago may thirty-first last year that como was shot and killed by a police officer in montreal  he was suspect in a shoplifting incident  and uhm the story is that the gun went off accidently when  como was on the ground uh being apprehended by police  uh the ambulance technician who was uh on the witness stand this morning said that when he got there como was alive but had a very weak pulse  and of course he died shortly afterwards  and we have a new picture to look at in connection with the murder of police constable raymond gagnon who as you know was murdered in senneville recently  the new picture is a picture of a man robbing a bank of montreal  there's now some reason to believe that he escaped in a car that may have been the same car that was the car that raymond gagnon stopped in senneville when he was shot and killed  so that picture is now being published and police are asking all of our listeners and all montrealers to take a look at the picture and see if it might be somebody that they recognize  politics  well would there ever be a day in quebec where we didn't have politics i ask you  but of course of course of course  and so the politics continue  jean chr&eacute;tien saying that he's sorry that lucien bouchard has cancelled his meeting with the prime minister for next week but he hopes that they can get together soon and that they can talk about working together to make canada work  not a whole lot of hope of that at the moment mind you  the census  this is a census day in canada  everybody in canada eleven million housholds involved  supposed to fill out the form and send it in today to ottawa  uh most people got a short form that only takes a few minutes to fill out  some got a longer form which takes quite a while to fill out as my wife and i found out last night  a lot of questions on that long form which we were unlucky enough to get i guess  conference board of canada says the next twelve months uh the economy is going to weaken from west to east  in other words very good in british columbia not bad in the west fairly good in ontario not very good in quebec and even less  good going east from quebec with the worst place to be being newfoundland  and those refugees who have been on a boat a desperate terrible boat about four thousand of them from uh the liberian capital finally have been accepted as refugees in ghana  many of them are so terribly sick that they might not even survive  c j a d news time is uh twelve oh five  at ten o'clock this morning the coldest place in the country was yellowknife  uh it was minus seven  the warmest was a tie between winnipeg and portage la prarie  they both had thirteen  which is where we are now in downtown montreal  but that was uh at ten o'clock our time  it was raining unusual eh in vancouver and victoria  snowing in fort mcmurray and grande prarie alberta  snowing also in peace river  raining in prince albert saskatchewan  and that's it  once you got uh east of prince albert there was no precipitation at all   and the white house you know we've had all the controversy here about the gay rights amendment well the white house says ah president clinton opposes same-sex marriage and may sign a bill to outlaw it   uh press secretary mike mccurry says clinton believes  this is a time to strengthen the american family   the bill would make the definition of marriage as only a legal union between one man and one woman and he would make that a part of federal law in the united states  the word spouse would be legally defined  as being a person of the opposite sex only  clinton's on record since nineteen ninety-two as opposing same-sex marriage even as you know there has been a certain amount of pressure uh to allow it  rosanne's final program of the season is on television tonight  uh but it will it will not be the final program ever  it had been scheduled the end of the rosanne program  but now she has decided that ah she's a new woman she says and so next year uh the program will be back   but apparently it's a because they thought it was going to be the end of the series altogether it's a real heartstopper   you can pardon the expression  with the whole cast dealing with uh dan's heart attack on the rosanne program  my medical story  scientists are hailing the result of a small trial of an experimental text for alzheimer's disease  they say the results are accurate so far but hurdles have to be overcome before the test can go into wide clinical use  nevertheless the test seems to have worked out very well  it uses skin and blood cultures and measures d n a damage  in the body  it correctly pinpointed all twenty-seven alzheimer's patient  in an initial study  identifying both the early onset kind of alzheimers and the more common form that comes later in life  so far doctors can't do much for patients with alzheimer's as probably you know but a correct diagnosis helps rule out other causes of dementia that can be treated  so therefore you narrow the danger down  and uh this is an aw-shucks story if ever there was one   a seven year-old girl in new mexico has agreed to get seven painful rabies shots to save the life of a little bear cub  that bit her  the black bear cub bit margaret marris'   finger as she was trying to lug it home as a pet not realizing that was kind of dangerous  she could have avoided the shots for rabies but that would have meant having the bear killed and tested for rabies  margaret said no you're not going to kill that bear  i'll take the shots   aw-shucks

i know that it's got a bit of a curve to it  you hit it a bit too fast and on a slick day like today and you can have trouble and that's what happened there  so watch it getting on and off the expressways  on the metropolitan otherwise things look uh good in both directions  d&eacute;carie southbound is working well and uh no problems so far in from the west island  thanks very much cam   in sports this morning well the big news is the canadian open tennis tournament  rusedski playing yesterday and uh this was the reaction of the crowd after he lost his singles match in the afternoon crowd jeering/taunting   well as laugh expected not a sympathetic crowd uh for greg rusedski although there were a few supporters out at jarry park yesterday  he had a doubles match later in the day which he won  marie macdonald was there uh throughout the whole day yesterday and she'll be in in about five minute's time with a complete report on what happened at jarry park uh with greg rusedski yesterday  should also mention uh that there was one upset  alexander volkov uh the sixteenth seed this tournament lost to arnaud boetsch uh six one six one  he was just uh cleaned out completely in that one  uh on tap today on centre court uh quite a few interesting matches to watch for  michael chang plays at eleven this morning if the weather uh doesn't prevent that against petr korda  uh one o'clock pete sampras uh makes his first appearance against jonathan stark  uh after that match stefan edberg and mats wilander will play  tonight uh another interesting slate of matches  uh at six thirty agassi plays his first match against jeff tarango  remember he was the guy that uh got suspended uh from play at wimbledon  and uh lareau plays against jim courier after that and then ivanisevic and all those other guys playing during the day today  so a lot of good tennis on tap today  uh the expos by the way ended up uh losing uh their game against the cubs yesterday in chicago  uh the uh score was six to five  the time now is sixteen minutes after seven music   expos did it again  they came from behind in los angeles last night  ninth inning they didn't have a run  they scored three and then held the dodgers and beat   em them three two  and they play there again tonight  colorado eliminated chicago blackhawks beating em   them in double overtime four to three  we go to the c j a d weather center and mister ted powel  it's warming up a little bit  a little bit  slowly  compared to yesterday  yeah   actually laugh   yeah you're getting there ted   not to bad a day actually  a bit breezy and at least we have some bright weather with us for the moment  the cloud is beginning to build though and it its the type of cloud that builds from instability uh george and that's exactly what we have uh moving in  just someting to kick off perhaps the odd rain shower  even an isolated thunder storm is not po possible  impossible a little later on this afternoon and into the early evening  that's because of a weak upper disturbance that will be ah moving across the area rather quickly late today  uh quickly in that it won't take long to clear right out behind it later on this evening and tonight  so a a very short lived weak disturbance moving through and that could give us a widely scattered rain showers even an isolated thunder shower  otherwise temperatures up into the mid teens this afternoon  uh generally in the fourteen to seventeen range for our highs  and we'll have those south westerly winds uh remain in the twenty to fourty range right through the afternoon  they'll begin to die down this evening  overnight uh under those clearing skies dropping off to between one and six degrees for our lows  tomorrow we'll have the sunshine with us again  almost a carbon copy of what we have today george except for the precipitation which will hold off until thursday morning by the looks of it  but we will see some morning sunshine give way to an increase in cloud during the afternoon  uh warming up to about fifteen to eighteen for a high  back to normal values  and again those southwest winds will shift around to the southeast in the afternoon  picking up to about fifteen to thirty  thursday is the most unsettled day of the week by the looks of it  lots of cloud around  uh summer showers or rain and uh hughs again of around seventeen degrees  but by friday we're back to the sunshine as high pressure begins to build in for at least the beginning of the weekend  uh high on f friday of around nineteen degrees  saturday uh sunny to begin with but i think we'll see some cloud build in later in the afternoon maybe even some evening showers  with a high of around twenty degrees   quarter after twelve and this would be mindy wyman  with uh skywatch traffic  all kind of calls coming in about uh police watching you with their radar guns  uh particularly out around the west island area  make sure you're driving that

Canada	 it is a history however that has to be told  the government takes this issue very seriously and is looking into how best to set the record straight and to symbolize our recognition of this sad event this very sad event in our history  madame speaker in more recent times the government of canada has acted to protect its citizens from this kind of treatment   the canadian charter of rights and freedoms guarantees equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination  through the canadian multiculturalism act the parliament of canada has recognized that our society is fundamentally multicultural in nature and has committed itself to the full and equitable participation of individuals and communities of all origins in shaping canada's future  the war a measures act as an example madame speaker has been repealed by this government   encouraged to immigrate to canada by canadian governments ukrainians were a vital part of the settlement process of canada particularly in the prairies  ukrainian settle settlers in the prairies madame speaker wanted no more than the chance to live and work in the indignity in this country in this country of canada    the ukrainians were among the founding settlers of canada especially important in settling the prairies  between eighteen ninety-one and nineteen fourteen one hundred and seventy thousand yur ukrainians one hundred and seventy thousand came to canada  and between the wars another sixty-eight thousand ukrainians came to canada  and after the great war thirty-three thousand more u  ukrainians immigrated to canada  ukrainians did settle however in small numbers in canada long before the mass migration or immigration that took place in eighteen ninety-one  according to the publication the canadian family tree there were soldiers of ukrainian origin in the de meuron and de wattville regiments which fought for canada in the war of eighteen twelve  some ukrainians settled in this in this time period  before this time period actually during the period  of of lord selkirk in manitoba   there're also ukrainians who settled in manitoba coming from the united states prior to eighteen ninety-one  madame speaker in the beginning the ukrainians faced a very difficult life in the prairies as they broke into this land and broke the land itself  in spite of this harsh existence community cultural and social life grew with a variety of organizations  womens' groups newspapers and periodicals architecture folk arts and poetry developed over the years  in nineteen oh five the ukrainian mutual benefit association was founded in affiliation with the saint nicholas ukrainian catholic church in winnipeg  among these ukrainian workers and farmers there emerged a credit union movement which began in nineteen thirty-nine when the new community savings and credit union was founded in saskatoon  and by the end of the nineteen sixties over sixty ukrainian credit unions served an estimated membership of fifty thousand people  over time the ukrainian-canadians like their fellow  citizens citizens had become an urban people  according to the nineteen eighty-one census there were  sixty-three thousand ukrainians in edmonton fifty-nine thousand in winnipeg fifty-one thousand in toronto   other major centres of ukrainian population are vancouver  montreal calgary saskatoon hamilton thunder bay regina and the niagara peninsula  of the five hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred and fifteen ukrainians in canada in nineteen nine uh excuse me madame speaker nineteen eighty-one fifty-nine percent lived in the prairie provinces and twenty-five point three percent lived in ontario  much of the cultural struggle for the ukrainian-canadian community  was has involved the maintenance of its language  in recent years bilingual and even trilingual education with  french teaching included madame speaker has been offered in the publicly supported education systems of the prairie provinces   ukrainians are a vital part of the cultural fabric of canada  to quote from the ukrainian community development committee report for the prairie regions published in nineteen eighty-six by the  ukai ukrainian - canadian committee the ukrainian situation as an ethno-cultural minority is a very special one permanently woven into the fabric of canadian society   over one thousand organizations exist within the ukrainian community  the painting of uh william kurelek inspired by his experience on the pare prairies have been widely recognized and george ryga is a writer of ukrainian origin of a national  stature madame speaker  ukrainians have long been involved in municipal politics as well  william hawrelak in edmonton and steven juba in winnipeg have been prominent mayors and the first ukrainian elected to the provincial legislature was andrew shandro in nineteen thirteen in alberta  in nineteen twenty-six michael luchkovich became the first ukrainian elected to the house of commons  over two hundred ukrainian-canadians have been elected provincially  another sixty have been elected to the house of commons  in nineteen seventy stephen worobetz became the lieutenant governor of s of saskatchewan   and of course a former honourable member of this house his excellency ray hnatyshyn now serves the country as governor general   and madame speaker during the second world war approximately forty thousand ukrainian-canadians served in the canadian armed forces   ukrainian-canadians form a vital part of canadian life  they are important exponents of recognition of the multicultural nature of canada  we must not forget however the history of the treatment of  of ukrainians that took place during the first world war  we must ensure that present and future generations of canadians understand the reality of canadian history including events such as ukrainian internment  many canadians are unaware the details of these events or  or even   they are even unaware madame speaker that they took place  they are seldom mentioned in the official history books or in museum exhibits or in popular press reports about historical events  madame speaker i'm grateful to the honourable member for this motion and for the occasion to speak about the ukrainian internment  more important madame speaker i'm grateful for those members of the ukrainian-canadian community for increasing public awareness about this history  without this knowledge of history we risk repeating the same kinds of mistakes whenever world crises break out or stoke the embers of fear and intolerance  in one of the most important conclusions of the spicer committee  report last summer was that canadians need a greater knowledge of their history and of themselves and of each other  and madame speaker if we are to remain together as a country   we wa we must encourage the recounting and the hearing of our histories  thank you madame speaker  introduce next speaker   yes  thank you uh madame speaker  uh i attended a meeting on behalf of the minister uhh i guess it would be probably about a year and a half ago at which the ukrainian redress committee uhh had a press conference and uh basically told their story  and i think it's a story that is the story of a minority in canada that still hurts  so i think that this motion that uh mister milliken has presented is one that should be given every consideration by the government  the government is committed to doing something to redress this uh historical wrong committed by previous a previous  uh government of canada and i think that the suggestions of mister milliken are certainly excellent ones that should be given every consideration so i will certainly support the referral of the motion  thank you   point of order madame speaker  allows c to speak   madame speaker i wanted to thank the honourable member for all honourable members the honemeber   honourable member for burlington edmonton-east carleton-charlotte and don valley-north for their kind interventions  and i since there is unan  unanimity on this point i wonder if uh rather than drop the motion it could be uh carried by unanimous consent   agrees   conducts vote and carries motion   ends parliamentary session   and you're listening to radio noon  my name is mary henny   it is now three degrees in downtown montreal  i'm going to give you the forecast in uh just a moment or so but first i want to tell you what's on the program today  uhm there uh is th this   it is becoming stran  stranger curiouser and curiouser about what might have happened on referendum night in terms of the voting  we have been following quite closely the issue of spoiled ballots  now there comes allegations that ah some of the votes were switched  yes and no votes were were switched  we're going to be speaking with johnston smithfield who's an investigative reporter at the gazette  he has uncovered these uh these  allegations  we're going to find out more from him about what it might mean  david finnigan has this story of a signmaker  it's a woman who makes these wooden signs in her basement  and david will have that story for us  it is tuesday and we have the radio noon farm panel  and on the phone-in today would you buy private homecare insurance  i've heard time and time again on this program mostly since the uhh news of the hospital closures came out in the spring people calling in very afraid of what that might mean  because as you know the regional health boards are saying that this is part of an entire restructuring of healthcare  that too many people are spending too much time in hospital  we don't need so many hospitals  close some down have the hospital stay shortened and have people sent home to recover and recuperate  and and there's a lot of wisdom in that  people are a lot more comfortable at home  course the big question is who looks after them at home  most of these people after an operation or or  any sort of treatment probably aren't capable of looking after themselves  particularly if you're elderly and if you're alone  there's a lot of fear out there  fear fuelled as well by the fact that if you call up the c l s c today centre local de services communautaires ( clinics) chances are they won't be able to send you anyone  but the c l s c's say that it'll get better as you heard  john peggoty reporting today  uh they are going to be getting considerably more money  a lot of that is going to go into home care and they say it's going to improve  but we also hear today from blue cross which is a private healthcare company and it says that it is going to step in where it sees a need  and it is offering private homecare insurance  for seventy dollars more a year if you already have one of their plans seventy dollars more a year  you can guarantee that someone will come in to your home and look after you  if you are sick if you're sent home from the hospital  a lot of people find that a very attractive offer  c l s c's are c are screaming foul saying that is that will completely undermine them  it's going to create this two-tiered system where the wealthy  get uh homecare and and the poorer don't get homecare  a whole lot of issues  our question for you would you buy private homecare insurance  that's next hour on the phone-in  and in fact we're going to start the discussion just before one o'clock when i speak to someone from blue cross to find out more about what it is that they are offering   now if you were sent home early after an operation at the hospital do you trust that the c l s c centre local de services communautaires ( clinics) would be able to send you someone to help you recuperate  the blue cross private health insurance uh company doesn't think so  so it has set up a private policy  it is a private homecare insurance and it has people really steamed at the c l s cs  our question next hour would you buy private homecare insurance music, drum roll at end   laugh now you knew that was coming  the beauty of it is you don't know quite when  it's three degrees right now in downtown montreal  storm on the way overnight  fifteen centimetres of snow expected  seventy kilometre an hour winds  uh by tomorrow morning it's supposed to change into ice pellets and freezing rain and rain by noon tomorrow  but a really bad night expected tonight in ah the montreal chateauguay a and townships as well as the laurentiens area 
Canada	 mister speaker uh pursuant to standing order thirty-two two i have the honour to table in both official languages copies of a document entitled shaping canada's future together  french, 20 seconds applause, 15 seconds, then short introduction by extra-corpus speaker   mister speaker i rise to table the government's proposals to renew the canadian federation   the proposals entitled shaping canada's future together have one simple but nevertheless critical and crucial objective to build a stronger and more prosperous canada where all canadians can feel at home  and i believe mister speaker that that is shared by all members of this house who believe in canada applause, 10 seconds   every generation of canadians has had to redefine the terms  of living together  our generation now faces that same challenge   if we're wise and we remain true to our traditions we can transform challenge into opportunity  our goal is not only a framework under which all canadians can feel at home in this magnificent country but one that better equips us to meet the challenges of the global economy in the twenty-first century  and beyond because if we must provide canadians with a valid constitution  we must also mister speaker provide canadians with a powerful and a growing economy  and one goes with the other  and these two challenges have to be met by all members of this house   canada's needs are well-known aboriginal self-government  two houses of parliament that are truly democratic and progressively  more responsive recognition in principle and practice of the distinctive character of quebec protection for the rights of all canadians and particularly for minorities a stronger canadian economic union  bringing government closer to the people in framing national programs and in delivering programs and services to individual canadians to people  reducing wasteful overlap and duplication in government programs  there isn't a member in this house who hasn't heard directly from  h his and her voters in regard to not only the overlap and the waste in government but the perception that it is perhaps in some cases even more widespread than actually meets the eye  and of course the government at all levels not just ottawa but governments at all levels that listen and lead and one that truly empowers people in exercising its powers   mister speaker none of these changes is in any way contrary to the original concept of confederation now a hundred and twenty-five years old  rather these changes add up to a renewal now long overdue if the truth be known of our confederation  french, 1 minute 5 seconds   sentence partially cut to our proposals and we expect changes   the joint committee will hold its first meeting tomorrow   and mister speaker the first witness before the joint committee will be the right honourable minister for constitutional affairs  whose outstanding leadership in developing these proposals i know that all members from all parties will want to acknowledge with respect and gratitude applause, 20 seconds   today mister speaker i don't intend to go into a detailed explanation of all of these proposals  they will be available to members of the house and of course to the media and eventually to all canadians   rather i wish simply to outline them so as to convey to the people of canada what lies behind the proposals the spirit that motivates them the objectives we have had in mind in developing them   in the canadian constitutional tradition there exists side by side  protection for individual human rights and the rights of members  rights of people rather as members of communities  the people of canada cherish these rights as attributes of our common citizenship  they are defining characteristics of our canadian identity   they capture in many ways the essence of what unites us   our proposals therefore seek to enhance both individual and collective rights  for example mister speaker we are proposing that the canadian charter of rights and freedoms be amended to guarantee property rights among our basic rights in canada applause and crowd reaction, 10 seconds   and we are also proposing more stringent limitations on the so-called not-withstanding clause which enables legislatures to override  many of our basic rights  of the various communities whose rights need and deserve protection the aboriginal peoples of canada have in my judgement a very important claim  on our attention and the attention of all members   we have made a commitment to them that they will participate in the current constitutional discussions   and we propose to entrench a continuing constitutional process for aboriginal matters  consistent with these guarantees of process the time has come to break with our recent history in aboriginal constitutional matters which sadly has largely been by any objective criteria a history of failure  we are proposing to entrench in the constitution of canada a general right to aboriginal self-government within the canadian federation and subject to the charter applause, 10 seconds   our proposal would allow governments and aboriginal peoples ten years to agree on the powers to be exercised failing which they would be defined and enforced by the courts  in other words mister speaker the passage of time would work for and not against the aboriginal peoples of canada   no aboriginal leader i know believes that self-government is by itself the remedy for the terrible deprivation and alienation that are so prevalent among so many aboriginal peoples but none esterate  underestimates the value of regaining the right to self-government and the responsibility that goes with it in providing an opportunity for first nations renewal   that is what they ask the right to get on with their own lives as members of aboriginal societies the right to devise their own solutions to the terrible problems which over generations have come to afflict these societies the right to work out their own place by themselves in canada's future the chance of a new lease on life  and i'm proposing a deadline on negotiation of the powers of aboriginal self-government because mister speaker and i want everyone in canada to understand this because i believe that we dare not wait another generation  this is a matter of human dignity of justice and fairness  we can't repair the past but we need not be condemned to relive it either   and so let us all together ensure that the future of the aboriginal peoples belongs to them and to their children in fairness and justice and equality of opportunity for all applause, 10 seconds   french, 55 seconds applause, 10 seconds   french, 2 minutes 20 seconds applause, 20 seconds  french, 30 seconds applause, 10 seconds   french, 1 minute 20 seconds applause, 15 seconds  french, 2 minutes 50 seconds   i believe that we all know that the people of canada are going to be looking carefully to see whether in proposing change and renewal for canada we far parliamentarians might seek to exempt ourselves  well we cannot and we must not   i am sure that we all realize that in the minds of the people of canada no area of our national life is more in need of improvement than the parliament of canada itself applause, 7 seconds   i want to draw your attention to our proposals for reform of the house of commons  some may say these proposals breach long-standing parliamentary traditions  i would argue to the contrary that these proposals are more faithful than some of our modern practices have been to the essence of parliamentary government and m p's prerogatives and individual freedoms  if we pursue proposals along these lines we will have government much more responsive to the elected representatives of the people and we will have members of parliament much more responsive to the people who elected them in the first place  we will then be closer to the british system of parliamentary government as it was originally meant to be  we will have a more vibrant and a more vital canadian parliamentary democracy   the people of canada properly demand a renewed house of commons and a reformed senate  i believe mister speaker that our senate proposals are very much in line with the expectations of people across canada but i look forward to the views of the public and the recommendations of the parliamentary committee  the senate that we are proposing today would for the first time be directly elected by the people of canada applause, 15 seconds   an unelected body exercising legislative powers equal to the house of commons is simply not compatible with democratic government   the senate should also be much more equitable in its representation than is the present chamber  equity includes a range of possibilities from weighted representation of member states such as in germany to equal representation of provinces as advocated by the canada west foundation  and we propose and effective senate  as a general rule in order for a measure to become law the approval by both the house of commons and the reformed senate should be necessary and the senate should have to approve key government appointments that affect the lives of canadians  for example under this plan in the future nominees such as the governor of the bank of canada would have to go before a reformed elected senate to explain his philosophy and obtain the approval of that body  applause, 10 seconds   on legislation involving language and culture special voting rules a double linguistic majority will apply as proposed mister speaker  by the alberta legislative committee in nineteen eighty-three and the government of newfoundland and labrador in nineteen eighty-nine   on matters of particular national importance such as defence and international relations the senate would only have a sus  suspensive a suspensive veto  under our proposals the house and the senate would have somewhat different roles and responsibilities but we believe that good government demands that only the house of commons be a confidence chamber in order to prevent the kinds of constitutional instability that parliamentary federal systems have known at other times and in other jurisdictions  the commons would likely become a chamber in which there was stricter adherence to the principle of representation by population  and the senate in consequence would provide more balanced and more equitable representation among the provinces   both houses would have real power  most important to canadians the senate like the house of commons would for the first time be accountable and responsible to the people of canada applause, 10 seconds   and so i think uh mister speaker there wouldn't be much quarrel about it that in the eyes of most people for the first time the reformed senate would have as it is proposed today or perhaps as is modified by the uh parliamentary committee would have democratic legitimacy   mister speaker for some years canadians have felt an increasing frustration with governments at all levels and that's pretty obvious to all of us   millions of canadians sense they have lost power and influence  over decisions that affect them their families and the places they live  we must act to try and bring government closer to people   the reforms we are proposing to the house of commons and the senate would greatly improve the responsiveness of parliamentarians to the people  word tape cuts out in the first place  french, 3 minutes 30 seconds   and so mister speaker to reinforce the bonds that must unite us and to strengthen our capacity to compete and prosper in the world our proposals include several fundamental reforms to our economic union  there are more interprovincial barriers to trade and commerce within canada today than there are among nations of the european common market  these barriers in our internal market weaken the canadian economy and impair our ability to compete in the world  that is why we are proposing that the constitution be amended to prohibit government barriers to the mobility of people goods capital and services anywhere within canada applause, 15 seconds   in law and in fact our economic growth is profoundly affected by the policies and actions of both the federal and provincial governments  fundamental conflict between federal and provincial economic policies can be absolutely disastrous  even working at cross purposes can diminish our prosperity  it is absurd that the twelve nations of the european common market are moving towards a state of economic coordination and harmonization superior in many ways to the canadian economic union which has been together for a hundred and twenty-five years  and so obviously we must do better  we must equip this country with the means to act decisively to ensure as best we can our own prosperity  and that is why we are proposing to amend the constitution to provide the parliament of canada with a new power to make laws for the efficient functioning of the economic union of canada   and that is why we are making a number of important proposals  to formalize the coordination of federal and economic and fiscal policies
Canada	" together it is these reforms that produce the strongest framework of economic union since confederation  mister speaker we propose as well a canada clause which would be entrenched in the body of the constitution in section two of the constitution act   i hope and believe that all of our people will see reflected in that clause their own place in canada the common values and aspirations that unite us and our national characteristics and our identity as we wish it to be  we are a nation with an immense capacity for generosity and compromise a capacity that has never mattered more than it matters today   parochialism small-mindedness mistrust these are always present in any society   these lesser attributes have had their day   it's now time for the fundamental qualities of generosity and compromise to dominate the process   there are in all twenty-eight proposals that the government of canada is putting forward today for consideration by the joint committee and discussion with the people of canada  french, 45 seconds applause, 7 seconds   mister speaker these proposals which are perfectible which are going to a committee which will begin hearing tomorrow will hopefully be examined in an objective and fair-minded manner not by people  sear searching for perfection because perfection can become the enemy of the good but for proposals that are good for canada  no one need lose   this isn't if if if the cause and the hopes and aspirations of western canada are advanced  that does not mean that that advan advancement  means a lose for quebec  and if french canadians feel no more secure as a result of constitutional proposals and feel a greater attachment and a greater love for canada that doesn't mean that the rights of canadians   in english canada in english-speaking canada say in the atlantic regions need in any way be diminished  this can  constitutional proposals fairly considered actively debated  generously contemplated can be what they should be a win-win situation for all canadians applause, 10 seconds   and how are they to be considered   well each one of us across the country each premier or each  taxpayer or each parliamentarian each of us will have to establish i suppose his or her own sense of parameters and his or her own   sounds like "" hone"" objective criteria  but i think that these proposals must also be considered in light of our greatest obligation  we've got many obligations  you can enumerate them  you can count em them   you can divide em them   you can add em them up  but our greatest obligation as canadians and as parliamentarians sitting here today is to turn canada over to our children and our grandchildren unsullied and undiminished as a great prosperous united nation  that is our fundamental obligation  applause, 15 seconds   and to do that will require compromise  and compromise is not an indication of weakness  honourable compromise in canada has always been seen as an indication of strength and maturity  the wisdom of knowing uh that all of us have to find our own places in the canadian sunlight makes me hopeful mister speaker that this proposal these series of proposals once engaged will give us all the opportunity to participate in the building of canada  thomas d'arcy mcgee who was a son of ireland but who became a father of canada saw a brilliant future for our country  seven years before confederation he said i look to the future of my adoptive country with hope though not without anxiety   quote continues   mister speaker i along with all other members of this house and all political parties i too see such a country a country of women and men of your children and mine whose standard of living is the envy of millions and whose way of life is admired around the world  this country canada the second largest country on earth is also according to the united nations one of the two best countries in the world in which to live and the challenge for us now is to make canada second to none applause, 10 seconds   the challenge is to build a stronger country for the security and the prosperity of all canadians  mister speaker i have said in this house and other occasions that the job of nation building did not end with confederation  and had they sought had the father of confederation sought perfection and insisted on perfection there'd have been no canada in eighteen sixty-seven  and that was the beginning of nation building but it continues with each generation and it continues to this day in our minds and in our hearts  and we want as mcgee said a constitution cherished in the hearts of all of its people  not part of its people not some of its people not the people who live in the west and the east but english-speaking canadians french-speaking canadians from the north the south the east all canadians are deserving of a constitution that re represents  them and reflects their hopes and dreams and aspirations for a new and a better canada applause, 10 seconds   so we have the challenge to keep canada and today we have the opportunity to improve it  mister speaker nothing would serve the economic interests of all canadians more directly than clear resolution of constitutional challenges  they've bedevilled this nation for too long  and i think it would be with a sense of national relief and gratitude that all canadians dealt with a proposal and managed to bring this to a successful conclusion  in that spirit i invite all canadians all political parties who believe in one undiminished canada to set aside other differences and to engage in nation building with the full exuberance that this magnificent country deserves  i suggest mister speaker we get on with it the building of canada of the vision of mcdonald and cartier and mcgee and the country of our own dreams a new canada for a new century honoured in the family of nations as a modern and flexible and caring country a canada respected by its peers a canada loved by its people a canada better able to serve its citizens with governments and institutions revised and reformed by this parliament and by all canadians that will be tied to the very best that canada can provide applause, 1 minute 15 seconds   introduction applause, 25 seconds   mister speaker i rise in this house today very conscious of the importance of the issue before us   at a time of significant national debate each of us must fulfill our duty to the best of our ability  at a time when there is cynicism about the role of politicians it is particularly important that the political process work the way it should  i want to be very clear mister speaker that the role of opposition is not to give a blank cheque to the government nor it is our role to oppose simply for the sake of opposing something  the role of the opposition is to scrutinize to ask the right questions to propose improvements and to seek to correct error   the role of the opposition is to speak for those who have no voice  this is a role that we will fulfill in the months ahead  i want to say that our objective is the unity of the country  but applause but this does not mean that we will necessarily agree with all of the proposals of the government  indeed our first impression is that the proposals of the government need a great deal of work  over the next few months some of the debate will be about issues of principle and we will fight for our principle by proposing improvements but much of the debate will be about legal text   what does one word mean  what does one phrase mean  are these flaws that can be corrected or improvements that can be made  french, 1 minute 5 seconds   part of audio cut out individual governments and the courts must rely upon it must accurately reflect the intention of its authors  let us resolve not to transform a debate on legal meaning of proposals into an emotional debate about rejections and humiliation and let us not transform a debate about values into a lot of empty rhetoric and political posturing  clearly it is too early for anyone to state definitively a hard and fast position on the government papers  constitutional language is extremely important  and some of the government paper lacks legal precision  in many places we do not have a specific proposal just a list of options   over the coming weeks and months with the help of the people of canada we in this party will work to find the tape cutes out   in this round we will not tolerate constitutional wording which is so deliberately ambiguous that it can be used to mean one thing in one part of canada and something else in other part of country applause, 10 seconds   ensuring that these proposals are thoroughly debated  thoroughly reviewed and where necessary amended abandoned or enlarged that is our duty  it is a duty we in this party will honour  we will not compromise on principles   french, 20 seconds applause, 5 seconds   french, 3 minutes 5 seconds   part of audio cut out are written for all to see mister speaker  the people should never be ignored  i will hold the prime minister to his promise made today before the entire nation his promise to involve the people of canada in this new round  applause, 10 seconds   this joint parliamentary committee is to report at the end of february   we must use the remaining time to study the proposals to debate their meaning to consult widely and to listen to the people of canada  mister speaker i have spent time talking about the process  because the process is very important   now i will address principle which are equally important   one of canada's greatest constitutional thinkers the late professor  scott f r scott once wrote that if canadians can agree upon great and lasting principles upon which they wish their society to be built  then they can agree upon the broad outlines of a constitution to achieve these ends end of quote   our principle as liberal are clear  one what is proposed must be compatible with the very nature of canada a nation which finds its raison d'&ecircumflex;tre  in sharing diversity and respect for r   the right of individual  two applause, 5 seconds   two the solutions proposed must result in real reform of our political institutions to ensure that the distinct concern of canada's regions are respected   three the solution proposed must recognize the need to renew and modernize our economic instrument including the training and mobility of our workforce to create policies that will permit us to be competitive in the world of tomorrow   fourth constitutional reform must not weaken must not weaken the right of individual as guaranteed in the charter of right and freedom  applause, 7 seconds   fifth constitutional reform must not weaken canadian duality and official language minorities everywhere in canada  six constitutional reform must not weaken canada's cultural diversity and its heritage of tolerance   and finally number seven constitutional reform must not weaken the ability of a strong federal government to speak and act for all canadians  applause, 15 seconds   mister speaker the liberal party of canada entered this party convinced that the things we call canadian values are as relevant today as they have been at any time in our history   at a time when canadian values are under attack and when our country is divided as never before we believe that canadians must remind themselves of the greatness of the canadian experiment   we also believe that canadians must devote their energies to finding new bonds and new endeavours which reflect our collective values  we must concentrate now on what unite us and not what divide us  applause, 7 seconds   more than ever we must commit ourself to true canadian values values like generosity of spirit and collective action  values that will permit us to meet the next century with our head held high  in discussing constitutional reform we must reflect on the great and lasting principles of our society   constitutional reforms must have one goal mister speaker and only one goal  that is the well-being not of governments not of politicians  not of bureaucrats but the citizens of canada applause, 7 seconds  which government holds which powers only matters in as much as citizens are well-served  therefore to serve the citizens of canada and that is what all of us have been elected to do to serve them we must understand the values we share as canadians  after all canadian citizenship means more than a shared passport  it is shared values  and quite frankly canadian citizens have a right to a government that can speak and act for all canadians  as canadians we have a unique and profound commitment to a shared sense of social responsibility "
Canada	 we believe in equality and equality of opportunity  we respect the individual  and we also have a very strong sense of obligation to the community as a whole   we believe that we are responsible for each other   we believe that it is our responsibility every one of us to ensure that canadians wherever they live enjoy a canadian quality of life  the partnership of french-speaking and english-speaking canadians built a nation where french is not spoken only in quebec   and i'm very proud to s sit   be in this house today and i've been elected  by a riding where the majority of the people are acadian and i'm very proud that they are french and can parlent fran&ccedille;ais qui sont vraiment de fran&ccedille;ais   french, 10 seconds applause, 5 seconds   in a country where english is not restricted to the other nine provinces there are a lot of people in my province of quebec who are as good quebecers as any one of us and who are f   french english-speaking and they deserve to be protected like anybody else  that is a fundamental cuner cornerstones  of what we call canada   i want to state clearly that we will not accept any constitutional change that will effectively split canada in two nations nine english provinces on one side and a french quebec on the other side  canada's aboriginal peoples are a fundamental characteristic of our country too   but at the same time the treatment of aboriginal citizens is also a test  it is a test of our values  it is a test that we have failed in the past  we must not fail again in the years ahead applause, 10 seconds  we have built a country that has welcomed people from every corner of the world  diversity and multiculturalism the fact that we can be different and be canadian too those are fundamental characteristics of canada  french, 1 minute 45 seconds   let me repeat mister speaker we have in this party have recognized that canada is far more than the sum of its parts  it's far more than a community of communities  a strong national government has always been necessary to meet the great challenges we face today  and a strong national government will remain necessary to meet the global challenges we will encounter in the months and years ahead  applause, 10 seconds   the liberal party will not compromise on this principle  and our approach to constitutional change will be guided by this principle  let me be clear mister speaker in canada we have a strong foundation upon which to build the future  we do not have to rebuilt our nation from scratch  instead we must improve upon what we have already  french, 50 seconds   part of phrase cut off objectives of the liberal party on a constitutional reform in montreal on april twenty-first  they will guide us in our work over the next few months  let me repeat them here in the house of commons  first to propose an inspiring declaration of the nature of canada  this declaration will set out the will of canadians to live together in a federal state the principle which government's at stake  the values we share our commitment to two official languages a recognition of our diverse cultural heritage a recognition of the distinctiveness of quebec and a recognition of the role of the aboriginal people  the government has tabled such a declaration  we will examine its wording and propose improvement where necessary  second a commitment to the charter of right and freedom  all canadians have an attachment to the fundamental right and freedom found in the charter  they want to see those freedoms strengthened  in the liberal party our position is very clear we will not we will not accept any constitutional change that   de diminishes the rights and freedom of canadians protected by the charter  applause starts we will not accept that applause stops   third strengthening the canadian economic union   in canada the federal state we are in the canadian federal state we are entitled to expect the full benefits associated with the unrestricted mobility of people goods  services and capital  this is essential if we are to develop internationally competitive products services and technologies things we need to meet  the demands of globalization  then we need to break down interprovincial trade barriers  those barriers are becoming are coming   down all over the world and we must break them down in canada too  the government has made some proposal in this area   our first reaction is that they need to be strengthened  they appear to be too many loopholes  we will be recommending a number of major improvements   fourth institutional reform   the regions of canada need to be more involved in decision-making and policy-making at the national level  to meet the hopes and dreams of those who live in the west and the atlantic a reformed senate is essential  it must be a senate that is elected effective and equitable  such a senate should have the power to examine appointments to important federal institutions and agencies  it should also protect the rights of minority language groups  and it should also require a double majority for legislation touching upon the french language and culture   it appears the federal government has adopted a lot of this proposition  we will listen carefully to the view expressed before the committee  french, 2 minute 45 seconds applause, 10 seconds   french, 20 seconds   since the creation of the charter nine years ago the supreme court of canada is becoming more and more of a constitutional court  for that reason alone it is reasonable to expect that the provinces should have greater involvement in the appointment of judges  to this end a formula along the lines of the one proposed in the meech lake accord could be adopted provided there is a real deadlock-breaking mechanism   aboriginal people seven   across canada there is a broad consensus on the need to deal with the problem faced by canada's first citizens   there is understanding of the need to deal with the status  rights and claim of these people  in our view any constitutional package must enshrine the rights to self-government applause starts and it is part of the package  applause stops   the process eight the amending formula  the process by which the constitution is amended must be addressed  liberals want a regionally-based amending formula combining flexibility with protection for each region and significantly improved public participations in the process  we believe it should be addressed now not later   nine a national referendum   i have proposed the use of a national referendum to ensure that we get the full participation and approval of canadian people  i believe that the final constitutional package that emerges from the parliamentary committee report is put to the canadian people for their approval  that will be the supreme test of its legitimacy applause and crowd reaction, 15 seconds   french, 35 seconds applause, 10 seconds   french, 1 minute 50 seconds applause, 7 seconds  french, 20 seconds applause, 7 seconds   french, 45 seconds applause, 10 seconds   french, 45 seconds   i want to address a few comments to canadians outside of quebec  i say to them that the meech lake accord failed for many reasons  one reason was that it did not address the legitimate concerns  of aboriginal peoples of the north and of western and atlantic canada  i was amongst those who said that changes and improvements were required   for a constitution to succeed now the aspirations of aboriginal people as well as the hope and dreams of the people in the north west and atlantic must be addressed  i have consistently said in quebec and i have paid a certain political price for it that the needs and aspirations of the rest of canada must be addressed in any constitutional reform package  i said we need a canada round applause, 10 seconds  but i want to say to the rest of canada that quebec too has needs and aspirations which are legitimate and which must be met  applause and crown reaction, 10 seconds   french, 25 seconds applause, 5 seconds   i appeal to the values we share of tolerance and particularly of generosity   let us use the next few months to understand that quebec's distinctiveness makes canada a greater country applause, 5 seconds   let us use the next few months to understand that the flourishing french fact across canada helps us compete in a global society  let us use the next few months to understand that aboriginal self-government is a test of our values  let us all this month demonstrate over the next few months thoughtfulness reason generosity  a willingness to accommodate and a skill to negotiate  let us get this constitutional issue behind us so that we can be equipped to deal with the real problems and challenges confronting us  applause, 10 seconds   there is nobody that has been obliged to talk more about constitution than i since nineteen eighty so i hope that i will turn the page soon and that we'll devote our attention to jobs to competitiveness to the environment to health care to make sure that we have our proper place in the world of tomorrow applause and crowd response, 10 seconds   but do not forget mister speaker that this government has forgotten so often namely that we cannot get our constitutional house in order until we get our economic house in order applause, 10 seconds   the two issues are not distinct  they are intimately linked   we in the liberal party of canada will be watching and will not permit the government to sweep our economic crisis under the rug  while the constitutional dance starts once again  mister speaker our nation is an history of accomplishment  it histor history   its history is not one of conflict  the liberal party has always worked to build a strong united canada  i cherish that legacy  and we shall continue that work of building a strong and united canada  there is a lot of work to do to improve this package  a lot of changes are necessary  we all have to work together   and this time the people of canada are watching  i want to tell the house of commons and the government that we want to achieve the goals to keep this country together and give the canadians a new constitution and a new departure for the twenty-first century but we have to do it in a way that it is acceptable to all the canadians  we have to do it in a sense that rather than divide us that will make us closer to each other cos we have too much in common to be complacent  and what i want to say that we will this time be in opposition to make some suggestions  and i hope that the government will listen because the last time my predecessor had made some very good propositions in this house some good amendments that if had been accepted by this house then there would have been no crisis but they were all rejected applause, 15 seconds   because they were all rejected this time we will  propose some amendments we will help in the committee to find solutions we will make sure that every canadian is comfortable with the new constitution because ladies and gentlemen to be canadian is the greatest asset we're having  it is the asset that we want to give to all our children and grandchildren because in spite of all the problems we're having when we receive anybody coming here  like yesterday morning i had the privilege to meet with the president of ukraine everybody went they look at us they envy us and it is our collective duty to make sure that this fantastic country remains one united proud and independent canada  merci beaucoup applause, 55 seconds   introduces next speaker applause, 15 seconds  thank you mister speaker  today we begin a new journey as parliamentarians as people of canada and as a nation   we know it will be a difficult journey  it will sometimes be exhausting sometimes painful  and that it will require from all of us on all sides of this house as well as from coast to coast to coast an openness and a tolerance for the diversity of this country and a commitment for the strength of a united canada that acknowledges that diversity and which will truly make us strong as we go into the twenty-first century   mister speaker although there will be problems along the way  there is also the promise of a better future   if we travel well and if we move in the right direction and achieve a destination we can agreee upon as canadians we can build that better country a united and an enlightened canada that stretches from the atlantic to the pacific to the arctic ocean  that canada mister speaker is the goal of the new democratic party  i want to make it clear that this indeed marks the starting point of a journey 
Canada	 as the prime minister has pointed out he will be open to suggestions  he will be open to changes   the proposals put forward by the government are just that proposals  and the job of the joint parliamentary committee will not be that of simply selling those proposals or indeed selling the point of view of any one political party but to take these proposals to canadians and to listen to canadians  today the government of canada has put forth its proposals and we have heard those proposals and now we must go forward to hear the people of canada applause, 7 seconds   in the coming months there will be much to say and i'm sure there are things that canadians can agree with in this document but we must also raise questions and issues as well  i and my party are committed to an open process  we have agreed to serve on the parliamentary committee because we believe that there we can help to open up that process a process through which canadians can truly be heard and not just heard but listened to  and a process through which canadians can accept or modify or reject or change or add on to what the government has put forward today  the final outcome must and will reflect the views of all canadians  the constitution cannot be left simply in the hands of politicians but must be the work of the hands and the minds and the heart of the people of canada  let me also say at the outset that we recognize that the are these are tough times for canadians  canadian families have many preoccupations the high unemployment rate the difficulty in a vastly changing world  and it's not easy to think about constitutions and nation building when canadians are worried about jobs and taxes about trying to make ends meet and so this debate has to be made relevant to canadians and it has to be meaningful in the day to day lives of canadians applause, 10 seconds  having said this let us be very clear that the stakes are high   we are talking about whether or not canada will continue to exist as we know it albeit with change  we are talking about holding onto and strengthening a nation that is much admired around the globe   there is no one who has voted for myself certainly or anyone in this party who has given us permission to work to tear this country apart but they have said to us we must work to keep this country together to renew the federation  that is the responsibility i take as the leader of the new democratic party  that is the responsibility that my party assumes and will participate in applause and crowd reaction, 10 seconds   but there are some people mister speaker in all parts of canada who say that it's too late for canada  and to them let me cite the words of a first generation immigrant  who said and i repeat i came here as a guest  rahim balangee writes and canada was generous as it has been to the generations of guests it has accepted and accommodated in its short and glorious history   quote continues   well mister speaker i can only agree with that person who chose this country for many of the values that all of us hold dear because it would be a tragedy mister speaker because we are a nation like no other populated by the first nations a vibrant french-speaking society rich regional cultures people who have come from every corner of this globe who make up the reality of canada in nineteen ninety-one and who work together as we move to the twenty-first century  we are a northern nation mister speaker of great possibilities where citizens and cultures come together  i'm here because i believe in this northern nation  i believe in this possibility  i believe that though we are far from perfect we offer the world an example of tolerance and harmony and yes we can give to the world some hope   we have a responsibility mister speaker to others to ourselves to those who follow to fulfill the promise of canada  i'm here because i believe we can join together to correct the flaws address the injustices and create the best canada we can a canada that all canadians will want to belong to  let me turn then to the proposals put forward today  french, 2 minutes 30 seconds   part of comment missing from audio are delighted to say  the least mister speaker to see the government is looking at the abolition of the present non-elected senate the goal we have held for many many years in this party  one also sees in this document mister speaker movement towards something else my party has long advocated and that is the recognition of the right of aboriginal people to self-government  in this document the government does not address the inherent right to self-government and i would suggest that that must be a major part of the discussion as the committee goes forward applause, 5 seconds   and let me say in this area mister speaker that a fundamental principle must be that aboriginal people must be involved in every way at every stage at every step along the way  the first nations of canada must have a prominent place at the constitutional table  let me say with respect to the division of powers mister speaker that it will take some time to fully study the government's proposals  we are talking about some fundamental changes  the new democratic party is not opposed to change but we feel in each area there must be a rationale for how that change will meet the needs of canadian people   in areas such as immigration and cult  culture for instance i think canadians must be able to see how these changes would in fact directly benefit them because all of these changes will have a profound impact on the future of our nation as a whole and how canada will come to be defined in the twenty-first century  i must restrate restate that the new democratic party believes that a strong canada requires a strong national government  any redistribution of powers that takes place must meet one fundamental test for this party  it must not be about meeting the demands of government  it must be judged on the criteria of meeting the needs of citizens  applause, 10 seconds   mister speaker it's my view that the role of the federal government must be re-examined  the government has put out some proposals on this  but let us remember if we to are to  accept the principle as i certainly do as my party certainly does that the diversity of canada is part of our strength that the rights of first nations the distinctiveness of quebec the rich culture and contribution of our multiculture multi-ethnic communities the equality of men and women all of which are fundamental to who we are as a nation if we are to recognize that diversity in a fundamental way we must also recognize in a fundamental way that the unity of this country will require a federal government that can represent every canadian in all parts of the country in the national interest and the international interest  applause starts that's what the new democratic party  word applause stops   i repeat mister speaker that there are a number of things that we can look favourably upon in initial reading of these proposals but there are also elements that are potentially disturbing elements that indicate that this government has a very different vision of the future of canada  a very different vision and of course it is the conservative party vision of canada but it is a vision certainly in some instances that is certainly not shared by the new nem democratic   party nor by many canadians  it is of course the government's right to put forward its vision in terms of its own political philosophy but if the consultation process if the parliamentary committee is to have any meaning we must seriously look at all visions of canada and try to come up with a consensus on what will best represent all canadians and not one agenda applause, 5 seconds  i want to raise some questions particularly mister speaker on the proposed economic union  i believe we can all agree in this house that the reduction of trade barriers at greater cooperation among provinces and territories is an important and a laudable goals but we must ask some hard questions  does the kind of domestic free trade in people goods finance and capital extend the same laissez faire principles of the canada u s trade deal to a domestic playing field   will there be winners and losers in this and if so how do we deal with that  could this potentially lead to a whole new round of privatization deregulation diminishing social standards and diminishing corporate taxes  as we look at this in terms of greater cooperation  and mister speaker we must raise questions about the ability within canada to reach the goals that we wish to to  reach in this economic cooperation if we in fact do not have a transportation infrastructure in place which is absolutely necessary in a country of this applause starts size and which has lamentably has been systematically destroyed applause stops   what does the right of corporations to free movement of goods services and capital mean for weaker provinces who seek to establish their own economic development programs  what does it mean for provincial crown corporations  what does it mean for provinces or territories trying to support local jobs in fledgling industries  what does it mean for affirmative action  what are the implications of this form of economic union  in terms of aboriginal self-government agreements  economic union that only addresses control and harmon  harmonization but does not mention initiatives to have greater regional equality and to strengthening section thirty-six of the constitution on regional equality falls far short in this party's opinion  applause, 5 seconds   economic union proposals that suggest that the only role of the bank of canada will be to address inflation but not as well to look at unemployment to look at fiscal and monetary policy as an instrument to address unemployment falls far short mister speaker of what we can be and can do if we're to have greater cooperation in the economy across this country  and so i say mister speaker that while we support greater cooperation while we support looking at a renewal of the relationships between the provinces territories and the federal government in economic areas we must also not simply take a defensive posture but a posture that says in this economy we will reach out we will initiate to seek greater equality and that that will be a strong commitment of a federal government any federal government of any political party and a fundamental part of our constitution applause, 10 seconds   mister speaker part of the proposals on the economic union include a council of the federation and there're again many issues i think that must be discussed in terms of what that council will do what kind of decision-making powers that council will have how those will mesh with the decisions of the house of commons and indeed what implications a council of federations has which according to the document instrument make many decisions when in fact aboriginal groups will not be included on that and yet we'll have according to the same document aboriginal self-government agreements  so there are questions to be raised mister speaker  we will be doing so in a constructive manner with alternatives   and i find that what is important as we move into this process at this time is that we are constructive and we do present ah proposals  and when we raise our vision of canada and our alternatives it's not simply to discredit someone else it's because we truly believe that each of us in this house each political party has a contribution which will be fundamentally in the interests of canada and that if all of those contributions can be brought together we will have the kind of consensus on a constitution that we must have because as we know the constitution is not simply the government's constitution the new democratic party's constitution the liberal party's constitution it is a constitution for the people of canada now and in the future applause, 10 seconds   mister speaker i also find it somewhat disturbing that the proposals put put forward today include such things as the entrenchment of property rights but make no mention of the need to entrench social rights applause, 5 seconds 
Canada	 and i have to ask mister speaker what this says about the kind of canada that government envisions  what kind of constitution will it be if corporations have rights such as to pollute the property they own when children have no recognized rights to health care in this country crowd response, 3 seconds   surely mister speaker our goal for canada must not simply be to further the rights of private interests but to further the rights of canadian families and to further the public good applause, 10 seconds  french, 1 minute 10 seconds applause, 5 seconds  a constitution mister speaker is in a word about freedom  the rights to equality to recognize diversity the rights of individuals  as enshrined in the charter of individual rights and freedoms   but i say mister speaker that there is no freedom without public health care  there is no freedom for the worker without a job  there is no freedom for the woman without equality  there is no freedom for the child without education  there is no freedom for the minority without human rights  applause, 15 seconds   a charter of social rights would direct governments to provide  quality health care work toward full employment move society towards equality provide education for our young and ensure that the human rights of all are respected   a charter of social rights mister speaker is about creating greater freedom  surely that is a goal that all members of this house  embrace  mister speaker as we enter this remarkable period in our history  the question confronting canadians is can we agree upon a vision  a vision of this country a destination that we can all share  i believe we can do that mister speaker  canadians are a caring and a tolerant people  we are a people who celebrate the richness of our society and value the bonds we share  we have a history of drawing on each other's strengths and compensating for each other's weaknesses  we have a future if we choose it of a stronger partnership a shared prosperity equality and freedom  i recently read an article about the opening of ah a new school in toronto and during that opening the school choir performed some  compositions  seventy-five children from every racial and every cultural background seventy-five very different children growing up together and learning to live together and singing together and among the songs they sang were dare to dream and look beyond tomorrow  let us think of these children mister speaker as we enter this new phase in the development of canada and of our constitution  let us dare to dream and let us look beyond tomorrow  applause and crowd reaction, 20 seconds tape cuts out   speaker introducing private members' bill before house  monsieur le president uh this is the first time i've had the privilege of winning a draw on private members' business and i was delighted that my uh motion was was  drawn in the uh recent draw and i can now present it to the house  uh i have a number of items on the order paper in the   uh under the uhh private members' business section uh and i'm pleased to at least have one come forward even if it's uh for a brief debate   i had hoped that perhaps at the end of the hour the government might allow the motion to pass uh so that we could uh possibly see some government action on this in this particular area of wh which i know the government is in fact considering   m many canadians mister speaker are unaware of the plight of the ukrainian-canadians who were interned during world war one   in fact uh when the war broke out the government said that  canadian- uh ukrainians who had immigrated to canada from the western ukrainian territories of galicia and buc bukavee  bukovina both of which were then part of the austro-hungarian empire uh were enemy aliens and they posed a threat to national security   mister speaker uh the government took the view that this threat required that these particular persons who were in many cases canadian citizens ought to be interned and held in camps for the duration of the war and accordingly about five thousand ukrainian-canadians were in fact interned by the federal government in twenty-six camps that were located across canada  one of those camps happened to be in my riding of kingston and the islands and was in the famous old fort there fort henry uh which was built sometime in the nineteenth in the middle of the nineteenth century   approximately eighty-eight thousand others mister speaker most of them uh ukrainian-canadians were forced to report regularly to local police and to internal uh security authorities  this uh in spite of the fact that in many cases these persons posed absolutely no risk uh security or otherwise to the canadian state   i'd like to read a quotation from a book written by lubomyr luciuk a constituent of mine mister speaker who's a professor at the   uh at queen's university in the department of geography  uh mister luciuk uh is a well-known ukrainian-canadian  and and member of the uh committee that is seeking redress in this case and he has written a pamphlet called a time for atonement uh subtitled canada's first national internment operations and the ukrainian-canadians nineteen fourteen to nineteen twenty  and i'd like to quote from his book page nineteen  from the mentioned book   again he's quoting  continues from the mentioned book   mister speaker uh the internment  internment uh went on for a considerable period uh until nineteen twenty in fact but uh the internment was not the only problem faced by these citizens  in nineteen seventeen uh many members will recall the government at the time passed the wartimes elections act the wartime elections act which disenfranchised most ukrainian-canadians as well as many others  uhh uh members will recall that the vote was given to women of men serv serving uh uh wives of men serving in the armed forces  it was also uh taken away from persons of german origin  canadians of german origin and other uh groups that were involved in the first world war on the other side  it was not an election act of which canadians can be proud  in fact uh frankly it was a national disgrace  uh the government rigged the elections very much in its favour so that it could win uh the nineteen seventeen election campaign uhm uh which saw the u union government as it then was run and win the election in that year   they paid for it in due course as a historical footnote because of course in nineteen twenty-one uh they were thrown out and replaced with a very sound administration under the very distinguished and capable william lyon mackenzie king   in nineteen eighteen an already censored uh ukrainian language press was closed down  uh and this obviously right near the end of the war  during the war ukrainian-canadians were often maligned in regional and national newspapers  they were forced to work as poorly paid labourers in remote areas and were often relocated away from their homes and their families   those imprisoned had their prof property  confiscated as i've already indicated  some committed suicide while they were imprisoned  and some were killed in unsuccessful escape attempts  when the war ended a large number of the uh of the  ukrainian-canadians were still interned and the government changed their status from that of enemy alien to bolshevik and kept them locked up  for fear that they might be sympathetic with the new communist regime in the soviet union  and not until nineteen twenty were the camps finally closed down  there was never any evidence presented in any public place  that ex that the ukrainian-canadians posed a threat to national security and indeed the government never produced any evidence to that effect at all  indeed in january nineteen fifteen the british foreign office informed the federal government that ukrainian-canadians should be treated as  friendly aliens  the government was told that many ukrainians like other nationalities within the austro-hungarian empire were opposed to austro-hungarian rule and would not therefore be sympathetic with  with canada's enemy in the war  the motion that i have put before the house is one that is supported by the ukrainian canadian committee  that committee wishes the government to formally acknowledge the unjust and unwarranted treatment that these persons received during the first world war  they would like to have the event commemorated by having historical markers established at the various internment sites including at fort henry in kingston which was the first site used as an internment camp  i should also note as an historical footnote that the same fort was used during world war two to house prisoners of war and indeed the international red cross uh made statements concerning its use as a  as a prisoner of war camp that it was not a suitable place to house prisoners so one can only imagine uh what the condition was uh during the first world war when no international organization apparently was involved in checking on the internees  the ukrainian canadian committee has asked the firm of price waterhouse to compile a study on the financial losses of the internees  the report is due later this autumn and once it is complete the committee would like to discuss the matter of redress with the government   the treatment of japanese canadian  canadians who were interned during world war two has clearly established some kind of precedent  however uh it's certainly clear that given the  ma many number of years that have elapsed since this internment took place very few if any of the internees must still be alive and accordingly the committee is not seeking a redress on an individual basis but rather in the establishment of a trust uh fund for the ukrainian community in canada which could be used for various purposes of that community   uh mister uh madame speaker the purpose of the motion that i have put before the house is to urge the government to look at the facts look at the record and see if something cannot be done that would in some way commemorate the evil that was perpetrated by our country on these people at that time  these were innocent citizens of our country who were never convicted of any crime who just happened to come from an area with which canada was at war  because of that they were deemed uh unsuitable to carry on their daily lives on their farms and their homes wherever they happened to live in canada were rounded up and herded into these camps   they were separated from their friends from their families from their communities and held far longer than was necessary solely uh because the government perceived there may be a security risk to our country because of the fact they came from that particular part of europe  with great respect uh it is clearly a situation that calls for some kind of relief  uh i'm not suggesting as i indicated earlier that payments be made to individuals and neither is the ukrainian canadian committee  the committee seeks redress for the community and seeks to have the fact of this internment commemorated in plaques at the various locations across canada where these internments took place  in closing perhaps i could quote uh my uh friend mister luciuk and bohdan kordan both members of the ukrainian canadian community uh when they published an article in the kingston whig-standard newspaper   the uh article i think uhh summarized at least the views of their community and they wrote as follows  quote from previously mentioned newspaper   madame speaker i know that the government is sympathetic to the plight of these people uh or to the plight that they suffered in any  in any event these many years ago  i know that the government is considering moving on this issue  i urge them to take the matter in hand handle it with dispatch  and seek to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory to ensure that the fact that this type of thing went on in our country is not forgotten but is indeed commemorated uh perhaps as a sad reminder of how sometimes we fall off our notions of fairness and equity and justice which we so often take for granted in canada today 
Canada	 thank you cough madame speaker  let me uh at the outset uh commend the honourable member for bringing uh his motion forward  it's uhm it's timely and uhm i'm pleased to be able to add a to address the motion and acknowledge the treatment of ukrainian-canadians at the hands of  past governments  we all agree that uh mistreatment of canadians because of their origin is unacceptable  unfortunatelty madame speaker the history of our country has not always reflected the principles of justice and equality that make us proud canadians today  thankfully this sad chapter in our history is now behind us   of course if history cannot be changed howe   however these events must be brought out into the open  this mister speaker concerns each of us  we firmly believe that canadians must be aware of the   of situations like this one and that it is important to set the record straight  madame speaker our government today is commited to building a strong multicultural society one that abides by the rules of justice human rights and mutual respect  the basis of this uh commitment is clear understanding of how canada came to be  we must be able to confront our history and and  to face up to our past  prime minister mulroney ha has  committed himself to a formal apology regarding the matter of ukrainian-canadians interned during the first world war  we must not forget that ukrainian-canadians helped build this country  we must not forget that the history of ukrainian-canadians is closely interwoven with the growth and the achievements of the prairies  their contribution to canadian life which began in the eighteen hundreds continues today  as canada's fifth largest ethno-cultural group the ukrainian-canadian community is present in every sphere of activity cultural professional educational political religious and financial  with a network of over a thousand organizations and a highly organized structure the community has a voice in over a hundred and fifty towns and cities across this country  ukrainian-canadians have come a long way  ninety percent of the community is canadian - born and therefore fully integrated into the mainstream of canadian culture  nonetheless madame speaker uh ukrainian-canadians are strongly attached to their heritage and therefore determined to maintain their culture their language and their identity  ukrainian-canadians are a perfect example of the country we are striving to build  they are full-fledged canadians with ukrainian heritage that gives them a unique flavour  their personality they they   personify i should say our our  multicultural society  as people committed to their language religion and  and cultural heritage the ukraine ukrainian   community has long since been the most outspoken advocates for a multicultural nation one that recognizes that diversity i  is fundamental uh is a fundamental characteristic of our country and a vital part of being canadian  in nineteen eighty-six the the ukrainian community produced an in depth study entitled building the future ukrainian-canadians in the twenty-first century  as the title suggests the document is proof that ukrainian-canadians are turned towards the future  they are men and women of action  the document established a strategic process of renewal and coordination within the ukrainian community in canada  it set specific goals in education arts communication cultural development as well as public policies and programs  they clearly stated that mulchie  multiculturalism was the key to maintaining their culture while  participating fully in the larger canadian society  ukrainian-canadians promote the concept of functional  trilingualism and many of them exemplify this goal by being fluent in english french and ukrainian  today yur ukrainians  can identify or can definitely pride laugh themselves   in being amongst the architects of the canadian multiculturalism act passed in nineteen eighty-eight  because they refused assimilation ukrainian-canadians have met challenges of integration while retaining their essential qualities of their heritage  today our country is proud of the numerous ukrainian - canadian personalities who contribute to the innumerable facets of canadian life  a life at rideau hall with governor general ray hnatyshyn  life in the supreme court with john sopinka  life in the world of sports of with  hockey players like like dale hawerchuk and mike bossy  life in the business world with bill terran to name uh a few among the many  these people and thousands more madame speaker confirm the enormous contribution of ukrainian-canadians to the economic and social development of this land  the ukrainian community ukrainian-canadian community i should say has come a long way  despite difficulties ukrainian-canadians have done well  they are a strong and and vital community and one that continues to prosper  this year ukrainian-canadians are celebrating the proud centenary of the ukrainian settlement in canada  the official opening which was held at the end of august marked the beginning of festivities that will unfold throughout the country during the next twelve months  the official closing of this centennial celebration in october  nineteen ninety-two will coincide with the triennial congress of ukrainian-canadians  many special events are planned by individuals and organizations on national regional provincial and local levels   what better time for this ukrainian for  th for this ukrainian-canadians to commemorate and honour their rich historical past salute their present and create a vision for the future  as the government stated in in this week's proposal for constitutional reform it is true that this country and its and its creation has not taken place without pain and suffering  the aboriginal people uh in particular have paid a high price for other people's search for freedom  canada has not always been inclusive and many have been left out of the benefits of citizenship  yet despite these gaps which are now uh only now acknowledging uh we are now only now  acknowledging and trying to remedy canada remains deeply symbolic of freedom in its broadest sense  many around the world still long to come to our shores to share in what we have built  people in other nations continue to risk their lives and sacrifice their security for freedoms that prev previous  generations have already guaranteed for us in this country  what better time madame speaker for all canadians to recognize the contribution of this vibrant community one which has undergone tremendous change over the past hundred of years but one that retains values traditions  and a language and all fundamentals of our canadian way of life  thank you very much   introduce next speaker   thank you very much mister speaker   excuse me madame speaker   uhh i too would like to thank and congratulate the honourable member from kingston for uh bringing this matter to the house today  it is a matter that uh has cried out for effective treatment for a long time   i'd like to start madame speaker by asking yourself and through you the other members present here today to uh conjure up a picture  in in your mind   uhm place yourself on on highway one a the the road that uh was there before the trans-canada highway one was built northwest of banff in the   in the bow river valley within the canadian rockies about halfway up highway one a between banff and lake louise at a junction  in front of the towering castle mountain which is a wall of rock  that stretches literally for miles rising up on the east side of the bow river valley   place yourself there in your mind on the road in the flatlands of the valley in the winter  few people stop along this road especially in the winter  the scenery is stupendous   the towering mountains are brilliant in their fresh coat of snow  and and with every gentle wisp of breeze the pine trees drop a cascade of snow in s   in a sparkling dazzle of crystals and colour  occasionally a car swishes by speeding towards banff to the south or lake louise and other points to the north   and madame speaker if while standing there you close your eyes and stand stock still and again use your imagination you can see another scene  a shockingly disturbing scene   right there and not very long ago for between nineteen fourteen and nineteen twenty in one of the most shameful episodes of canadian history thousands of recent immigrants to canada were imprisoned there  the concentration camp near castle mountain outside banff was only one of the twenty-six such internment camps scattered across the country  thousands of ukrainians and other people of east european descent  were designated enemy aliens stripped of their property and denied their civil rights  over eighty thousand people mostly of ukrainian origin were forced to carry identification papers and report to local police   over eight thousand others were separated from their families  confined behind barbed wire and forced into hard labour  and what was the crime that justified this imprisonment this massive injustice perpetrated under the provisions of the recently passed war measures act   madame speaker there wasn't one   these ukrainians were simply recent immigrants who happened to hold austrian passports  many simply didn't have a job   these were not enemies of canada  in fact the british government expressly informed the canadian government that these ukrainians should be considered friendly   in fact many of them had fled their homes to avoid being conscripted into the austro-hungarian army  but even though they had committed no crime these new canadians were forced to build the internment camps that contained them to build the roads including the predecessor to that highway one a to clear the land to cut wood and work on railway construction projects  later they were forced to work at miserable pay for private companies   thousands of us drive past these sites   these sites that used to be internment camps every year  yet few canadians know the extent of the hardship that was caused in canada to our own   canada should finally acknowledge that this gross injustice occurred here  we can never right the wrongs that were committed but we can teach our children what happened why it happened in the hope that they may learn from the past so that such injustice may not happen again  for this reason madame speaker i and the new democratic caucus and party of which i am a member very strongly support several steps  first an official acknowledgement by the government of the serious injustices that were inflicted on these ukrainian-canadians  second the placement of historical plaques at appropriate sites near those twenty-six internment camps  third the establishment of a national redress commission to review requests for redress of discriminatory acts of past canadian governments and recommend appropriate and expeditious action to deal with this and other dark episodes in our history  in addition madame speaker we support the partial reconstruction of that castle mountain camp in alberta as an educational site to which canadians could go and other visitors could go be encouraged to pause along their drive through the majestic rockies to reflect on what they themselves might do to ensure that such a f  sorry event never occurs in canada again and madame speaker perhaps as well to reflect on what it is that human societies can do to themselves when the idea of the enemy the other the apart  the separate becomes a more compelling idea than the certain knowledge that we are all of us brothers and sisters  madame speaker this is a motion completely worthy of the non-partisan support of all elements in this house  i greatly hope it receives that support  thank you   introduces next speaker   thank you madame speaker  i'm honoured madame speaker to speak in response to the motion by the honourable member and specially in light of the importance of the issues  being uh raised madame speaker   canada today is a vibrant and tolerant society that recognizes the essential nature of its multicultural reality  ukrainian-canadians have been major exponents of the recognition of the multicultural nature of canada  canadians can trace their origins to every part of the world  people from all over the world have played a major part in settling the land developing our resources building cities and forging transportation links over vast distances  madame speaker the internment of ukrainian-canadians during the first world war is not a proud moment in our history 
Canada	 introduction audience claps   now i don't know why the hell i'm here  we can forget culture as a resource  not really audience laughs   cos i'm a writer  i create illusory people and i uh  writers're often asked uh what do you do with a novel  do you blueprint it do you block it out and plot it and then do it over   well you don't  what you do with your illusory people is you find   em them first   they you find them you prospect for them  this is where the business of culture or arts as a resource  comes in   uh you find them in your own stored actual past   but very soon after finding these life models you gotta  got to take a creative leap   indeed i'm my second son read in since daisy creek uh i kinda kind of got corrupted over the years and there's an explicit sex scene in that novel  audience laughs   takes place with a professor in a university on a bed of mid-term papers audience laughs   when i finished it i uh said to my son who knows how i teach creative writing and that you must work out about a biography and knew about it he said geez dad i hope that was a creative leap audience laughs   i said it sure as hell was hewey  it's the biggest creative leap i've ever taken audience laughs  but you take this creative leap and you have to  even though your people have become fictional and the events unreal  you have to believe these unreal people   because to a certain extent they dicterate  they dictate what is going to happen in your fiction  now this isn't a healthy thing to do every day uh every month every year audience laughs   uh uh not only that as like many psychologists with their real people mine are almost always in trouble   uh i'm concerned with them in those times when life has become incandescent with stress with conflict uh love hate greed  generosity pride snobbery birth death marriage divorce success failure   now neither life nor art which is an illusion of life are simple  it's not either or  it's accord of comic and tragic  bad writing is either slapstick farce or it's melodrama or it's opera and i won't go into that then audience laughs   my wife has p a sense of perfect pitch  she thinks opera is wonderful but it does show to the worst writing ever done by man audience laughs   now a famous canadian doctor wilder penfield  searching was searching for an explanation of epilepsy  his sister had been had suffered  from it  and at the montreal neurological institute he was   he had a patient she was fully conscious and he had an electric stimulator probe and and was   touching uh stimulating certain parts of the cortex trying to find uhm a growth uh uh an injury something that would explain the seizures  while he was doing this she heard somebody singing   she recognized the tune she recognized the lyrics and it was her mother's voice  and as well the recall experience was in detailed and total context  emotionally   they established that she couldn't even have been three years old at that time  that's when he stumbled across the fact   th this started the idea of the bicameral brain   and it gives new importance to the caves of the subconscious where each human has stored a unique and individual past   and we know that thanks to wilder penfield that nothing which bombards a human brain is ever lost  it may be forgotten but it's not  now that's the resource   that's the unrefined resource  it's called life   it's smells sights sounds touches bits of people  emotions and you've got to prospect that stored re  resource   so i'm not too far off the thing here because the important thing about that art resource for a writer of short stories plays poems novels there's an important geographic dimension to it  and that dimension has its effect during the litmus years of childhood when somebody is stained  so boy if you're north of the forty-ninth parallel and i'm not far north during those affecting years for me when i built up my resources out of which i might refine uh i'm not a practicing poet but plays novels short stories  now as a child for the first twelve years i wandered over the prairie a great deal with the prairie wind dirging for me through the great prairie harp of telephone wires   they hummed they twanged and they seemed to endlessly adjust themselves against the prairie stillness  i can remember barbed wire fences and impaled on the barbs were butterflies grasshoppers earthworms maybe field mice  it was the shrike's supermarket shrike is a type of bird   audience laughs   and in the winter and earlier than that   they did it on the buffalo berry bushes with those sharp thorns  and in the winter i could f read bird prints on the snow the alternating dog tracks of a coyote or the domino ones of jackrabbits and they all signalled animal life to me not human life  again and again the skipping lift of a prairie meadowlark's song surprised me and in my new world at a very young age i learned i was mortal  i could die   the end of billy mitchell  that's probably the biggest thing i uncovered in the way of  an art resource for me  now when you learn you're gonna going to   die you truly understand you're human  you've been then given a perspective which is very helpful in deciding what is important and what is unimportant what is valuable and what is not valuable  a sense of one's own mortality does clarify priorities  the greek not the one who had the commercial cafe in wayburn another one named soc socrates said that the unexamined life isn't worth living  audience laughs   now there's an old prairie expression and i think it's still valid for the north and for fort macmurray i'm sure  says much the same thing don't you eat that there stuff elmer  it's horseshit audience laughs audience claps   the point is in your conference here challenge north  man doesn't live by reason and common sense alone  the simply intellectual life is not worth living either and the most valuable resource a nation has is that one uncovered by wilder penfield when he worked with the epileptic patient   you see art is the only thing humans do for its own sake uh besides the act of love audience laughs   this explains perhaps the great part that the arts play in culture  humans are the only animals who make poems plays novels drama  they are the only animals who paint dance sing sculpt compose  artists philosophers historians research scientists they know  that man is a finite warm sack of vulnerability  because of this knowledge they have an affair   unfair advantage over politicians and generals and quarterbacks and the heads of dow united fruit hooker chemicals audience laughs several times during pauses   cos see art's the only thing man does for its own sake  it doesn't involve an adversary relationship   there are no winners over losers no victors over vanquished  soviet over american toreador over bull  creative partners to artists who look and wonder at a painting or a play or a ballet or who listen to a symphony and since myrna isn't here even opera don't take anything from the artist  audience laughs   the book isn't taken from the author both partner and artist win through shared pity and terror compassion and empathy  laughter and tears   death and solitude justify art  they make it important   which draws human aliens together in the mortal family and unites them against the heart of darkness  humans must comfort each other defend each other against the terror of being human   there's a civilized accountability to others  the coyote the jackrabbit and the badger and the killdeer and the weasel they don't have it  okay so this is challenge north  so i wanna want to share with you a refined thing that came out of the autobiographical that i prospected my stored past of smells sights sounds tastes touches feelings and took a creative leap  very frequently it isn't a very large leap  it stays very close to the unrefined resource  now let's refine a little bit further from a autobiography  it's from a novel called how i spent my summer holidays   introduction   when you look at us as a biologist does we're not very impressive  we're not very fast   the uh any elephant can outrun the fastest human being on earth  we're not exceptionally strong   we're not gifted with special sensory aculit  acuity   we're not uh gifted with i with any   word and yet we have become the dominant species on this planet  the most numerous mammal on earth   our major survival trait of course is a huge and complex brain  a brain that enabled us to recognize patterns in nature   things like the regularity of the tides of the seasons of animal migration plant succession  as fran&ccedilla;ois jacob has said the human brain has a built-in need for order   and by creating order out of chaos we were able to uh anticipate events and to exploit that anticipation by uh wi  through our predictive capacities for our greater survival   thus from that human brain emerged the concept of  future  of course the future doesn't exist it's not real it only exists as an invention of the human brain  but because we invented an idea like a future it gifted us as no other animal has on this planet with choice  we can deliberately choose from a variety of options and thereby plot our way into a number of different kinds of futures  and for ninety-nine percent of our existence on earth that strategy worked  we were able to flourish and yet at the same time nature  seemed infinitely abundant and endlessly self-renewing   today we can see before our eyes that nature is no longer as vast as it alway tape cuts out briefly nor is it as resilient as it has been in the past   yet today with all of the amplified brain power of global telecommunications with computers with scientists and engineers we no longer seem able to do what our ancestors did  to act deliberately by choosing an option that would give us the highest survival attribute or possibility  and the question that we have to ask ourselves is why  why do we seem so paralyzed today  i've already participated in two days of preliminary discussions here at global forum and i'm afraid that it's clear that we still haven't established a discussion that deals with the fundamental context within which we can assess the human place in the planetary ecosphere  we are still so caught up in hu tape cuts out briefly  that we fail to recognize our absolute needs as biological beings  in the discussions that i've heard about the north versus the south in the need for greater input from women from youth from the handicapped and indigenous people there is little acknowledgement first of all that we are part of the web of life that contains perhaps thirty million other species   we are above all human animals   as dependent on air water soil and biological diversity as any other living things  these life support systems air water soil and biodiversity  are what make our societies possible  but today they are being torn apart by human numbers by poverty and technological muscle power  science can not begin to comprehend the vast diversity of living organisms on earth and their interactions with each other and the physical properties of the world  yet we hack away at nature as if it is infinitely renewable  and we pour our industrial excreta into life support systems   as if somehow air water soil can absorb dilute and detoxify these poisons indefinitely  we know for a fact that human activity is now creating change on a global scale that is unprecedented in scope and speed   our species is now increasing in numbers at the rate of three people a second and that rate is itself accelerating  agricultural topsoil is being degraded at the rate of twenty-five billion tonnes a year  and global food production can not be substantially increased by any of the de advances in biotechnology  industrial toxins many of them novel and hence nonbiodegradable are being poured into air water and soil at horrifying rates  in the united states alone over two billion kilograms a year  tape cuts out briefly air water and soil 
Canada	 the atmosphere itself is being altered by human activity  acid rain has already uh des  eliminated plants and animals in tens of thousands of lakes in canada and in europe   ozone depletion is occurring at faster than all projections indicate  every report that we get indicates a surprise because it's more severe than expected while greenhouse gases accumulate at ever greater rates  scientists do not and will not ever know enough to predict the consequences of such atmospheric change  but it is madness to use that scientific ignorance to justify carrying on with business as usual  the thin layer of light coating the earth is responsible for cleansing and replenishing the air water and soil   yet we are tearing it apart at the rate of one acre a second  and with that destruction of our wilderness areas go an estimated fifty thousand species a year   those are the facts   but you don't have to take my word for it   i keep getting people who say over and over i don't wanna  want to listen to you this is too depressing  why should i listen to anything you say  you're the doctor of doom and gloom   well ladies and gentlemen i don't apologize for reciting that litany   if one of my daughters got sick and i took her to the doctor and the doctor told me i'm sorry david your daughter is dying surely to goodness it would be irresponsil b irresponsible  of me to say listen doc i've had a t hard day i don't  wanna want to listen to all of this  the only responsible answer is to say i want you to tell me everything there is to know about her condition  and then we can get on with the business of saving her life  and i don't think that we can afford the luxury of saying this is too depressing i don't wanna want to face this  we have to confront the state of the world   and then get on with the business of doing what has to be done  to try to s make it ah continue to be habitable  but you don't have to listen tape cuts out very briefly  what i say  you can verify it for yourself  there's a very simple way   just ask your elders  ask anyone who's seventy or eighty years old  what was the world like when they were children   all around the world our elders are a living record of the enormous changes taking place within the span of a single human life  and by simply projecting that change that has occurred during their lives into the future you know with absolute certainty that our grandchildren will have drastically reduced opportunities and enormous and unprecedented problems that we have left them   yet in response to ecological warnings and the call for the need for radical change we continue to hear denial   we continue to hear rationalization   we continue to be uh assaulted with expensive multinational corporate p r with character assassination and downright hostile opposition   it's as if we're in a car that's heading at a brick wall at a hundred miles an hour and everybody in the car is simply arguing over where they wanna want to sit   we're not seriously discussing slowing down or changing directions  we're debating about whether that brick wall that we see is real   i wouldn't mind as much if i wasn't also a captive passenger in that car   every generation occupies a brief moment in time bridging all those that have passed on before them to with  all of those of the future unborn generations   north american aboriginal people speak of reflecting back on seven generations of their ancestors and ahead to seven generations of their children and only then do they make a decision   today the primary global competitors on earth are the nations of the north plundering the planet's resources to support  enormous mindless uh sorry economies mindlessly  committed to growth and hoarding the vast bulk of the world's wealth  while producing most of the toxic pollution   having wantonly squandered and compromised our natural resources  we now demand that countries in the south do a better job yet we plead poverty to avoid m a more equitable distribution of wealth  resources and appropriate technology and refusing to cut back on our own consumptive lifestyles   yet there is a massive treasure trove to be mined that's available to all of us and that is the global military budget   when a country is dragged into war we don't have  hear economic or political justifications for not responding   well we are in the middle of the mother of all battles  the fight to keep this earth habitable  all we need is vision leadership and courage to take the first step   who can best challenge us to get our priorities straight  i believe it is the most important group of people on earth our children  and i'd like to take this opportunity to let you hear from some of them from four of them who in fact made me come here in the first place  i wouldn't have come here if they hadn't demanded that i came as their chaperone  so i'd like to introduce you then to four girls who would like to give you their impressions of what the problem is audience claps  mic thumping   okay  hello i am severn suzuki from the environmental children's organization  we are a small group of twelve year olds from canada who are trying to make a difference  we've raised all the money to come here by ourselves because we have to speak to you adults to change your ways   future generations cannot speak here so i am speaking for them   the cries of starving children around the world are not heard  so i am speaking for them   the countless animals who are dying across this planet i am speaking for them too and we can't afford not to be heard   i'm afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in the ozone  i'm afraid to breathe the air because i don't know what chemicals are in it  i used to go fishing in vancouver with my dad until just a few years ago we found the fish full of cancerous tumours   and now we hear about animals and plants going extinct everyday vanishing forever   did you have to worry about these things when you were my age  think about it   this is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions  in my lifetime i already know that my children will not be fishing in the waters of vancouver   i'm only a child and i don't have all the solutions but i want you to y realize neither do you   you don't know how to fix all the holes in our ozone layer  you don't know how to bring the salmon back up a dead stream  you don't know how to bring back an animal now extinct  and you can't bring back the forest that once grew in a now desert  i am asking you if you don't know how to fix it don't break it   here you may be delegates of your corporations organizers reporters or politicians but really you are mothers and fathers  brothers and sisters aunts and uncles and all of you are someone's child   we are all a family five billion strong in fact thirty million species strong and borders and governments cannot change that  we are all in this together and should act as one single planet  for a single goal   in my anger i am not blind and in my fear i am not afraid to tell  how the world how i feel  in my country we take so we make so  much waste  we buy and throw away buy and throw away and yet northern countries will not share with the needy  no even when we have more than enough afraid to lose some of our wealth afraid to share  if all the money spent on war was spent on finding environmental answers and agreements what a place ear this earth would be  at school even in kindergarten you teach us how to behave in the world  why can't you do what you teach us  where are our examples  you teach us to clean up our mess not to fight with others  to work things out to respect others not to hurt other creatures  to share not be greedy   parents should be able to quell their child's fears by saying everything is going to be alright  we're doing the best we can or it's not the end of the world  until we start to change i don't think you can say that to us anymore  please think of us  thank you audience claps   i challenge any world leader to look me straight in the eye and say yes we're going to make a difference  my name is vanessa and i'm a part of the environmental children's organization eco and i'm here today to express to you how concerned i really am about the environment  it's important for me to ask the politicians that they're not going to throw my future out the window  coming up h up here today i have nothing to lose except my future  losing my future's not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market and no one will be speaking for all the unborn children who will have no voice here in rio  the the decisions made and unsaid will not just affect this year but many generations to come  this conference will not just affect us but children all around the world  we as children are not easily heard but our opinions are just as important of those of mul mister mulroney and mister bush  i would al like to remind the world leaders who they're making their decisions for them or us  who are going to be living in the next generation  thank you audience claps   spanish comments   my name is michelle quigg   i was born in canada and i've lived there all my life  i am also part colombian and have been fortunate enough to have visited colombia several times  i would like to share with you my impressions of the contrast between the two countries  in canada we live the privileged life with plenty of food water and shelter  we have watches computers television sets cars that make our lives easier  every day i wake up and go to school knowing that when i return home i will there will be food on the table  as a child i don't have to worry about having enough to eat or somewhere to sleep  often those children living the privileged life are concerned with trivial things perhaps the latest styles or toys  then just ten hours south of canada in colombia i feel  like i'm in an entirely different world  there i see children my own age living on the streets with the fear that they will be murdered by officials during the night  children begging for money  nine year old boys carrying bricks and planks of wood too heavy for their young bodies to support  children filling potholes and shining shoes  living in houses of bags and roof shingles  while flying on the airplane into rio i saw the favelas  brazilian slums countless shacks with no clean water or sewage treatment which in canada we take for granted  i can't stop thinking that these are children my own age  that it makes a tremendous difference where you are born  that i could be one of those children living in the favelas of rio  i could be a child starving in africa or a victim of war in somalia or a beggar in colombia  it just makes me realize how lucky i am to live where i do  it doesn't matter where we live children are children with the same hopes and fears  in colombia many starve yet in canada people are overweight from eating too much  we engage in activities such as pie-eating contests where people stuff themselves with food they don't need meanwhile millions of innocent people suffer from malnutrition 
Canada	 sustainable development is about economic social and environmental sustainability  on the economic side the forest industry contributes six percent of alberta's provincial revenues  this ranks at third behind the oil and gas and agriculture sectors  according to economic development and tourism the four billion dollar forest industry is responsible for fifty-six thousand jobs in alberta  there are fifty alberta communities classified as forestry dependent  this means communities where forestry is the primary industry  according to the provincial government eighty-five percent of the annual allowable harvest of trees has been allocated to logging companies in alberta  in nineteen ninety-five more than seventy-five million tree seedlings were planted by government and industry in logged areas  but according to ecologist ron lowen this can be a mixed blessing  while logged trees are being replaced he says the forest is being simplified which may actually diminish long-term sustainability of both fibre and other forest resources show conclusion   as a young graduate of the forestry program at the university of alberta i was never shocked by the sight of logged forests but i recall how the battle over the carmanah valley in british columbia affected me  when the tension was at its highest i drove to the far side of vancouver island past clear-cut after clear-cut past the weary security of mcmillan bloedel to the end of the road  there was active logging going on and the company was escorting people through the ruckus of the logging area to the gate that the western canada wilderness committee had built that marked the beginning of a trail into the rainforest  it seemed as if all the racket and the dry heat of the open clear-cut vanished almost immediately as you dropped into this magnificent humid temperate rainforest of ancient cedar and sitka spruce  the soft songs of the winter wrens were all that could be heard  within minutes  even with my forestry education it was easy to question the wisdom  and sustainability of clear-cutting  in british columbia the free ride of the first harvest of old growth forests is nearly over  companies now have excess mill capacity and they're scrambling to buy logs from private lands in alberta  amidst the crisis the b c government is creating a forest practices code  it's an extensive set of very specific rules that industry will have to follow if they want to stay in business in british columbia  b c silviculturalist doctor gerald loblaw calls b c's forest practices code draconian  he says the code is motive enough for alberta's forest companies to improve their practices before alberta winds up in the same situation as b c  there's no question things are changing in b c and in alberta  but can things change soon enough to make a real ecological difference in the woods  doctor jill laster thinks so  she's an ecologist and a member of the steering committee that's just finished the second major draft of the alberta forest conservation strategy taped phone interview with guest speaker   scientists and foresters alike seem to have discovered mother nature  jim labrynth represents alberta-pacific forest industries limited or alpac as it's known  faced with controversy at home and abroad this multi-national forestry company isn't waiting for a new strategy  it's creating its own brand of ecosystem management in northern alberta taped phone interview with guest speaker   some critics grudgingly agree that alpac is onto something  the old approach would be to simply go out and mow everything down in a patchwork of twenty to sixty hectare clear-cuts  however old growth forest ecologist and author ron lowen  doesn't think clear-cuts can be used as a substitute for fire  taped phone interview with guest speaker   still alpac's jim labrynth insists their clear-cuts aren't really clear-cuts taped phone interview with guest speaker   in alberta the ground rules for logging allow maximum clear-cut sizes of sixty hectares for hardwoods like aspen and thirty-two hectares for soft wood like spruce  according to steven lark with alberta's lands and forests service the average is even lower taped phone interview with guest speaker   lark says alpac has had discussions with government about increasing their clear-cut sizes but no formal requests have been made as of yet  ron lowen says clear-cutting and the subsequent planting of trees is not sustainable forestry because it causes the loss of biological and genetic diversity  he says trees and forests are going to need diversity and adaptability to survive in a future world of air pollution and global climate change  but if companies or the province are truly taking inspiration from nature it could have significant implications for management techniques  i asked labrynth about how pesticides and herbicides fit into alpac's version of ecosystem management taped phone interview with guest speaker   it's hard to say how the new forest conservation strategy will affect forest management in alberta but we could know as early as this fall  next week alberta may be getting set to announce a new forestry mega project  we'll try to find out if the forest can support it end of show segment introduction to next show   do you know what alberta's provincial tree is  if you said aspen you'd receive top marks for knowing it's by far our most common tree  but alberta's provincial tree is actually the lodgepole pine  the stately lodgepole pine is found throughout alberta's foothills  mountains and even in places like cypress hills and peace river country  this beautiful species is often found growing in stands of trees all the same age  that's because forests of pine are often born of fire  the cones of lodgepole pine are sealed shut by a sticky resin that prevents them from opening until they're heated by fire or sun  this and many other facts about alberta trees are recorded in a booklet entitled trees of reknown published by the alberta forestry association  the tallest white spruce on record was a towering forty-five point six metres  it was found by logging crews in the hinton area  that's one hundred fifty feet tall or taller than most fire look-out towers in alberta and more than twice as tall as most other trees  the oldest tree on record is a limber pine along the north saskatchewan river  it's reported to be more than one thousand years old  this windswept limber pine is only eleven metres tall but it is so wide it would take five adults to encircle the tree with their arms  show conclusion   it was thanks to the alberta forest service that i received my first introduction to the boreal forest  when i was a student of forestry at the university of alberta i spent one summer working for the forest service as a timber cruiser  in a nutshell this means i drove or flew to some of the most remote reaches of our northern forests to count and measure trees  it was all part of alberta's phase three inventory of forests  what it meant was walking through hundreds of kilometres of remote virgin boreal forests  on the long and often hot days of summer we discovered many wildlife species such as nesting great grey owls black-backed woodpeckers  and bears plenty of bears  i'll never forget the experience  i'll also never forget what it's like to share lunch with millions upon millions of insects  whether it's the arctic grayling in the house river or a spotted sandpiper in a wet open clearing in an old growth forest mostly what i learned is the boreal forest is an amazingly diverse and beautiful place  what i didn't think much about was why i was measuring all these trees  at the time the government had only allocated about twenty-five percent of the forests it had earmarked for forestry operations  since then the alberta government has allocated most or some would say all of the remaining public forests  under a management scheme known as sustained yield management  the forest service allocates volumes of wood to private companies based on what they call annual allowable cut  the theory is if you cut the same amount of wood that grows in a given year it'll be sustainable over time  i asked steven lark of alberta's lands and forests service  how much of the annual allowable cut is left unallocated in alberta  taped phone interview with guest speaker   lark is quoting a recent government report called the status of alberta's timber supply and indeed the report says of the twenty-two point one million cubic metres of wood available for cutting  fifteen percent or more than three million cubic meners  metres is unallocated  but according to tina lavallee a forestry consultant and a former manager of public policy and planning at the lands and forests service this may not be the whole story taped phone interview with guest speaker   in fact according to forest service sources virtually all  of the so-called unallocated harvest is already committed to daishowa-marubeni international alberta newsprint and numerous other companies  we've learned from several sources that only about half of one percent of the coniferous and five percent of the deciduous annual allowable cut has not been committed  this means ninety-four point five percent of alberta's annual allowable cut has been committed to companies  the grande alberta paper company is currently negotiating with the alberta government for access to an estimated eight hundred thousand cubic metres of wood  i asked steven lark if their needs could be satisfied  out of the existing allowable cut taped phone interview with guest speaker   throughout our forestry series foresters have been telling us that the lands and forests service is moving from sustained yield management  to sustainable forest management  as lands and forests service policy advisor sam lamberthad  says the forest service may adopt sustainable forest management as early as this fall taped phone interview with guest speaker   this is ironic since the vast majority of alberta's public forests  have already been allocated or committed under the old sustained yield model  since nineteen eighty-nine the forest service has revised and reduced their provincial annual allowable cut figures at least twice  according to the timber supply report the annual allowable cut has been reduced by four point three million cubic metres or sixteen percent since nineteen eighty-nine  steven lark told us he doesn't believe the forest resource is over-allocated at this time and that he couldn't comment on whether the government intends to allocate one hundred percent of the annual allowable cut  this could be an important question since dramatic previous adjustments and un annual allowable cuts and the government's commitment to sustainable forest management and  unresolved land use issues such as the special places two thousand program could all affect the amount of timber available for harvesting  forestry consultant and former forest service planner tina lavallee taped phone interview with guest speaker   i also asked tina lavallee if bio and genetic diversity and sustainable forestry were considered in the government's annual allowable cut calculations  according to dan lawton the author of a report on biodiversity in the aspen forests there may not be enough room in some of the older forest management agreements to accommodate sustainable forest management  he says new techniques that would be needed to protect things like biodiversity could leave some areas squeezed for timber taped phone interview with guest speaker   doctor tom lech a professor of forestry at the university of alberta agrees  he says he doesn't believe sustainable development biodiversity or ecosystem management can be accommodated within current annual allowable cut levels  he warns some forest management agreements may have to reduce their harvest levels to accommodate the changes  steven lark of the forest service counters that other resources have been considered and that the government's approach is conservative taped phone interview with guest speaker   so can alberta support another forestry mega project  the answer isn't simple  lark says if grande alberta paper goes ahead part of the wood supply would come from the unallocated forest and the rest would come in the form of residual chips from existing sawmills  if grande alberta paper and the government come to a tentative agreement on a wood supply there is still the hurdle of the natural resources conservation board  and the n r c b has already indicated that for the first time ever forest harvesting would be examined in addition to mill site impacts  before any approval is given   foresters used to call aspen trees weeds  elk often gnaw on the bark of these trees when they're hungry  bears often mark the aspen's smooth white trunk with their massive claws leaving evidence of their presence for all to see  the trembling aspen is alberta's most common tree  with its striking white bark it should never be confused with its low-down moist-site-loving cousin the balsam poplar 
Canada	 it's a spring day on the northern thesque prairie near  hattiesborough alberta  i'm traveling north and the wind is howling like it sometimes does at this time of the year  mile after mile along the highway i begin to notice that the melting snow in the ditches is black in some places and not in others  wherever there's tilled soil there's blackened snow in the ditch  in nineteen ninety-six more than sixty years after the dustbowls of the dirty thirties the soil still blows on the prairie  today we'll try to find out if agriculture is sustainable in alberta  it has been estimated that farm production has doubled since the nineteen fifties due to technology  but does that say anything at all about sustainability  the question we try to answer here on the chevron ecofile is how are we doing and is it sustainable  in terms of agriculture this is indeed a loaded question  technologists at alberta agriculture told us we're doing pretty good and that gross production with inputs meaning chemicals and fertilizers is a good measure of sustainability  but the key ingredient in sustainability is the health and productivity of the ecosystem  emmanuel creppin of the sustainable agriculture association said that what's being done today is not sustainable but he concedes things are improving  uh however there's uhm on the other other  side there's ah an increased uh awareness by farmers of uhm environmental protection from the point of view of uh uh soil conservation and uh preservation of uh biodiversity   soil quality is one of the key ingredients for sustainability in agriculture and according to a new agriculture canada report called the health of our soils we may have overestimated soil degradation in the past  the authors conclude that we've lost fifteen to thirty percent of the soil organic matter on non-eroded land since cultivation  soil organic material is what holds water and releases nutrients for plants to use  land without organic matter becomes in effect a surrogate mother requiring additional inputs to produce crops  technology is able to compensate for depletion of the soil  chemical fertilizers and herbicides can improve production quite dramatically  the question remains is modern agriculture sustainable  fred mcgratton is a farm management consultant in winfield alberta   in terms of sustainability in alberta i don't think we're doing very well at all or in canada or in north america uuh on any of three fronts uh socially uh ecologically or financially in agriculture  extracorpus speech continues   according to agriculture canada the risk of wind and water erosion in alberta went down by about ten percent between nineteen eighty-one and nineteen ninety-one  that is good news  summer fallowing on the other hand is still a problem on twenty percent of alberta's farmlands  the thinking is is that if you rest the soil by not planting a crop one year and control the weeds by ploughing the field  summer fallowing which used to be seen as a way of resting the land and you know controlling weeds and so forth uh is probably the most destructive practice uh we have in agriculture extracorpus speech continues   it has taken half a century for thirty-five percent of alberta's farmers to stop summer fallowing  one of the common complaints about modern agriculture is the extensive use of monocultures or planting vast fields of the same species which critics say can be financially risky and ecologically dangerous  we need to get very serious about trying to increase the number of species of plants that are on our land extracorpus speech continues   to mcgratton farming is not simply a matter of applying better technology with the goal of always increasing production  he says this strategy's created higher but unsustainable levels of production financial stress for farmers and a lack of desire for young people to stay on the farm  so what if i'm a farmer on the treadmill  what can i do  you need to start looking at a what do you want out of life and why do you need the big tractor and the big land base and all the inputs and so forth and and b are you  start planning profit and look at every enterprise you're running and saying okay let's say i ran three hundred thousand dollars through my bank account last year and i only kept twenty extracorpus speech continues   that's it for this week  next week we'll look at one family that's put the family  back in the family ranch  a ten thousand acre cattle ranch might be the last place you'd look for a dramatic new sustainable form of agriculture but join us next week when we travel south of hattiesborough alberta to talk to maureen  and ryan suggs about the h y ranch where success has as much to do with the number of bird species as it does cows   at its root sustainable development is about overcoming some of the world's most serious problems such as overpopulation global warming and pollution but having acknowledged all that perhaps what sustainable development is to each individual is quite simply the creation of a better more sustainable life for ourselves  consider marco polo   he farms three hundred and sixty acres near allenton  alberta  at first glance you might be hard pressed to see this as a sustainable development story but at its most basic level sustainable development is not a complicated concept  it's about living within our environmental means and about minimizing our impact on the world around us  marco polo does this by self-sustaining by not consuming too much and by providing for as many of his needs as he can with locally-grown products  today we'll travel to allenton alberta to discover  marco polo's unique brand of alternative agriculture   allenton is a small town south of athabasca alberta  the population a hundred and sixty-eight  this country can best be described as boreal forest  it's well north of the aspen parkland and the prairies of the south  marco polo's grandfather farmed and his father farmed but despite that he went to the big city to work as a geologist  but in nineteen eighty-six he returned to his roots when he bought a small farm in northern alberta  i asked marco to describe his operation  i've got about three hundred and three hundred and six sixty acres  extracorpus speech continues   marco's strategy is clearly one of diversification  marco decides what to do on each part of his farm based on its suitability  well what i have to do is is   i i i farm on the basis of holistic management rather than like i say as as as some traditional farming practices where they look at piece of land they say how can we make this produce more grain   on his relatively small farm marco polo farms trout raises cattle has hay land and crop land he logs and near the busy highway he's built a market garden  marco is the consummate opportunist  whether driven by sustainability or just good old fashioned gumption he has a unique ability to integrate his operations  to give you a ah like example of what i'm doing is  is i've i've planted trees on a hillside to prevent erosion   marco's farm woodlot operation had recreational beginnings  i have in this creek valley about a hundred and twenty-five acres of trees and and and in that hundred and twenty-five acres i created a system of about ten kilometres of trail just virtually crisscrossing the entire forested area  extracorpus speech continues   but as fate would have it marco's ski trails eventually became logging trails and today because of the trails and  marco's unique operation the manoc pulp mill pays him to maintain a demonstration forest  marco actually saws up aspen and uses it as lumber  he sells the by-products as pulp the leftovers as firewood and the knowledge he gains in his books  another kind of neat little thing that i do is  is i b i use beavers  in my logging operation extracorpus speech continues   marco looks at his trees as r r s ps registered retirement savings fund   when most people head off to the bank to purchase r r s ps  marco heads outside and plants trees thousands of trees  he's calculated that a dollar's worth of trees planted in nineteen forty-seven would produce sixty dollars worth of logs and lumber in nineteen ninety-five  that's a pretty respectable nine point one percent annual return on investment  the point is to return nine point one percent plus think of all the benefits you get extracorpus speech continues   an interesting concept but let's not stop with marco's  r r s trees  what if the trees he plants also serve as a shelterbelt for the farmhouse or the livestock  if you plant a shelterbelt around your house you'll save probably ah between one-quarter and one-third your heating costs   that's the house  but what about the livestock  marco says a well-planned livestock shelterbelt can save you fifty dollars per head in feed costs by keeping your cows cosy in the wintertime  by now you can perhaps see how a word like eclectic  might stick to a guy like marco but there's still one more stone we've left unturned  marco's next project and his next book he's already written two is going to be a building a twenty-two hundred square foot home for under thirty-five thousand dollars  he plans to build this by supplying the lumber from his trees the labour from his back and the land from his farm  marco polo calls what he does alternative agriculture  in his market garden he probably derives as much income from the experience of berry picking as he does from selling the berries  he's also got some more trout ponds and some cabins in the woods in mind  where else can you stay in a cabin made from beaver-logged aspen  marco's books are farming alberta published in nineteen ninety-five by big pine publishing and good farming in the woods   if you have trouble finding them they're both available for twenty dollars each from the author at box two nine three allenton  alberta t seven p seven k seven   that's it for this week's feature report   it's a disturbing trend but according to the world watch institute in washington d c the number of farm pests developing resistance to pesticides is growing rapidly  by nineteen ninety-three over five hundred species of insects and mites around the world have developed resistance to one or more pesticides meant to control them  in addition one hundred fifty plant diseases and one hundred thirteen weed species have also developed resistance to pesticides  it's trends like these that have led to pressure to reduce the emphasis on chemicals on the farm  in ontario farm pesticide use is down thanks to the urging from farm groups and a government program that seeks to reduce chemical use by fifty percent  in alberta thirty-one hundred farmers have voluntarily taken a farmer pesticide certification course offered at olds college  even biological control methods are vulnerable to fast evolving pests  researchers are now working on integrated pest control methods that use fewer chemicals and more biological controls  they're also trying to avoid pests by using carefully developed crop rotations  that's it for this week's facts and trends  i'm annie gillis   facing the challenge of creating a sustainable world is a daunting task  in fact close consideration of global issues like population growth and global warming can be downright depressing  this fact was brought home to me recently when my thirteen year old niece tammy rae mcgratton told me one of her big worries is what the world will look like under global warming  it reminded me of worries i had as a youngster about nuclear arms  roy lansing knows all about these problems but he's a solution oriented kind of guy  today we'll gaze into an environmentally sustainable future  music   roy lansing 's roy lansing is  an author a futurist and he's a member of a think tank set up to design an environmentally friendly community on vancouver island  we caught up with him at the recent striking a balance conference in edmonton where he was asked to lead a discussion about creating a sustainable future  his entertaining and positive style captivated and recharged the audience of urban planners politicians environmentalists and developers  in a serious but amusing futuristic scenario lansing  predicts everything from solar power revolutions to employment for the unemployed and the rise of compost modernism all in a brave new sustainable future  he warns of rising food prices as food shortages become more and more common because of population growth  he predicts the fall of shopping malls and the rise of community trusts mandated to stimulate local business and self-sufficiency  his message is one of hope and one which he says proves things can be turned around in twenty short years  rather than feeling overwhelmed about important global issues  roy lansing faces them head on  i asked him how he was able to take such weighty issues and apply his contagious enthusiasm to them  well it's partly a personal thing that i  i extracorpus speech continues   part of dancing's inventing the future involves tackling some of the biggest issues of our time  consider global warming  changing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide one of the most common gases on earth could have devastating implications  but rather than dwell on the consequences dancing  presents solutions that allow anyone to see a future of possibilities  extracorpus speech   think of the possibilities if you could unhook yourself from the power grid  better yet how would you feel if your meter started to run backwards on those hot sunny summer days when your solar powered roof is producing one hundred and twenty percent of your power needs  extracorpus speech   creating a sustainable future requires economic environmental and social sustainability  the walking school bus helps out in all three areas  extracorpus speech   indeed imagination is all that stands between humanity and a sustainable future  ray dancing says it's time north america dropped its nineteen fifties vision of life as commuters in the suburbs and substituted something more functional something more environmental and something more sustainable  as an environmental and community development consultant for  orington a pioneer sustainable community of twelve thousand people on vancouver island dancing has a chance to put some of his ideas into action  it's an experiment in community level sustainability that focuses on community composting biological sewage treatment support of organic food producers and even the protection of a small old growth forest 
Canada	 since nineteen seventy worldwide bicycle production has soared from twenty-three million to one hundred eleven million per year  today three times more bicycles than cars are produced each year  according to the worldwatch institute that's a good sign of sustainability  not only do bicycles avoid nearly all of the greenhouse effect causing of cars they don't require nearly as many roads that eat up valuable croplands  this is especially important in asia where half of the world's population is supported by only one third of the world's cropland  according to worldwatch institute growing interest in the car has already caused bangkok thailand to pave over most of its famous canals with roads to reduce traffic congestion  about six hundred new cars are added to the streets of bangkok every day  now that's the equivalent of three kilometres of bumper to bumper traffic  at this rate it will only take four years or so to fill the entire road system with one solid lane of traffic  worldwatch says this rate is unsustainable in physical terms that any tourist can see  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   ray dancing's an author  he's a consultant to a major community project on vancouver island  and he's a futurist  but most of all ray dancing has a knack for facing down some of the world's most challenging problems with spirit and enthusiasm  today as we continue our conversation dancing predicts an ensuing food crisis will send guerrilla gardeners into the streets in search of golf courses and boulevards in which to plant food  we'll also ask ray dancing why he thinks gross national product is a poor indicator of sustainable development music, 20 seconds  according to the worldwatch institute the nineteen ninety-five grain harvest was a was the smallest in seven years  in fact food production is fifteen percent below its historic peak of three hundred and forty-six kilograms per person in nineteen eighty-four  when you juxtapose declining food production with the world's population which is increasing at a rate of ninety million per year you begin to see the potential for serious problems  we spoke to ray dancing at the striking a balance conference held recently in edmonton  i asked him what implications increasing population and the greenhouse effect pose for food production  extra corpus speech, 2 min 15 sec   farm prices are already going up in alberta and grain prices are also on the rise  as if rising prices and growing population wasn't enough to deal with questions are also beginning to surface about diminishing returns from the use of technologies like pesticides and herbicides  extra corpus speech, 1 min 35 sec   if there's one repeating theme we've heard in our series about sustainable development it's a trend towards schemes that are more ecologically inspired  waylon riggs told us managing his ranch was far easier and smarter in an economic sense if he worked with instead of fighting nature  foresters told us in our series on sustainable forestry that ecosystem management is a scheme that will not only grow good trees it'll also help preserve bio and genetic diversity as well  and this is at the heart of dancing's vision of a sustainable future  it's not enough to simply talk about integrating environment economy and social needs you have to do it  for a long time gross national product and economic growth have been principle indicators of economic progress in the western world  dancing thinks the time has come to question growth and the g n p as key measures of progress  extra corpus speech, 2 min 15 sec   if ray dancing's right we may all eventually realize one of the original promises of technology more leisure time  that would certainly be a contrast to what we've seen so far higher stress levels very little job security and high unemployment  ray dancing also has a theory about shopping malls  he thinks they'll soon become a thing of the past  he says the return of the neighbourhood store and the growth of internet shopping will be the driving forces behind the death of malls  he predicts shopping malls will be will respond  by redeveloping their huge parking lots into little urban eco villages complete with homes shops and a neighbourhood square  if you're interested in ray dancing's ideas watch for a new book he's writing called two thousand and fifteen or get on the internet and search for ray dancing   that's d a n c i n g   you'll find plenty of articles and other information about sustainable communities  next week british author jeff danes thinks part of creating a sustainable future is for humanity to reunite its ties with nature  you're listening to the chevron ecofile   that twenty year-old lawnmower may belch out black smoke every time you start it but hey it still runs  and that's precisely the problem says boris yechokovsky  with environment canada's mobile emissions division  lawnmowers snow blowers and other small engines can be hazardous to your health   using your lawnmower for an hour belches out the same amount of pollution as driving your car for six hundred fifty kilometres  yechokovsky says environment canada is investigating two possible solutions  the first is a catalytic converter that would sell for around ten dollars and could reduce emissions by up to fifty percent  the second solution being investigated is alternative fuels that could reduce carbon monoxide pollution by as much as sixty percent  part of the problem is we all use these small engines at the same time and since carbon monoxide is about the same density as air it just hangs around poisoning you as you do your lawn  fuel spillage is also a problem as hydrocarbons are rapidly released into the air whenever you miss the tank   the state of california already has plans to force manufacturers to cut emissions by two-thirds by the year nineteen ninety-nine  but you could do your part today by keeping your engine tuned or by borrowing a neighbour's push lawnmower   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   danny dressel is one of alberta's best known naturalists  he once said man's improving on nature is indeed very close to impossible   he also said the protection of wilderness is more than just an aesthetic it's absolutely necessary   in fact most albertans agree with danny dressel   the united nations brundtland commission on environment and economy reported in nineteen eighty-seven that protected areas need to be at least tripled to constitute a representative sample of the earth's ecosystems  the commission also indicated that saving species in their ecosystems is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable development  when alberta wrote its own sustainable development plan the completion of a system of protected areas was front and centre  today we begin a series of programs that will examine how alberta is doing at protecting natural ecosystems   alan van dusen was a naturalist an albertan with a very special appreciation of the world around him  he's a biologist a hunter an admirer of flowers a communicator and someone with a real knack for helping people see how the pieces of our complicated world fit together  i asked alan van dusen why we need protected areas  extra corpus speech, 1 min   but protecting nature is not just about buying insurance against the failure of human experiments  it's also about who we are  extra corpus speech, 1 min 20 sec interview ( question and answer) between a and z, 6 min 10 sec   that's it for this week's feature report  next week we'll try to find out how alberta's doing in the battle to protect vanishing ecosystems   there's been a long and distinguished history of creating parks and wilderness areas in alberta  it began in eighteen eighty-five with the establishment of banff canada's first national park  since then waterton lakes jasper elk island and wood buffalo national parks have been created  at almost forty-five thousand square kilometres wood buffalo is the largest national park in the western hemisphere  but according to the alberta government reports most of alberta's diverse ecosystems are still unprotected and in some cases vanishing  today we present part two in our series on protecting alberta's endangered ecosystems  speech, 30 sec   that was elaine sahal of the alberta wilderness association  alberta is short of protected areas  this may come as a surprise to many people who already know that alberta's blessed with some of the most beautiful parks in the world  but most of these parks were established to protect economic interests or national curiosities and not ecosystems per se  alberta's a wonderfully biologically diverse province  ecologists divide alberta into six major natural regions the grasslands aspen parkland boreal forest foothills rocky mountains and canadian shield  these six natural regions are further divided into twenty natural subregions  according to the alberta ecologist and author alan van dusen  the natural regions that are most endangered are the ones we live in  extra corpus speech, 3 min 10 sec   the idea of protecting alberta's ecosystems has been around in draft government reports and policies since the late nineteen seventies and early nineteen eighties but it wasn't until nineteen ninety-five when ty lund alberta's environment minister released the special places two thousand plan that it became government policy to protect ecosystems  according to doctor jay allanson of the university of alberta this is important because for the first time alberta's agreed to a scientific approach to protect ecosystems  extra corpus speech, 45 sec   according to the alberta government's nineteen ninety-five state of the environment report only four of alberta's twenty natural subregions are adequately represented  they include the alpine subalpine and montane natural subregions in the rocky mountains and the peace river lowlands in the boreal forest  if the government's own assessment of its progress isn't bad enough there's a scientific debate going on as to whether the montane is adequately protected  alan van dusen explains  extra corpus speech, 25 sec   van dusen says that more than five hundred and fifty square kilometres of montane in jasper and banff national parks is severely compromised  i asked alan van dusen what indicators tell us that things aren't well in the montane  extra corpus speech, 1 min 20 sec   very little comes easily in the struggle to protect alberta's natural regions and the options diminish with each passing day  less than twenty percent of the original grasslands are left and as little as five percent of the aspen parkland remains today  the world wildlife fund recently awarded alberta a b for progress on protecting endangered spaces  that's a major improvement over the f it received a year ago  alberta was recognized because environment minister ty lund promised to protect alberta's ecoregions by nineteen ninety-eight and for legally protecting willmore wilderness park north of jasper  since the program was launched alberta has created two new provincial parks twenty-seven new natural areas and one new ecological reserve  that's it for this week's feature report  next week the environment minister has promised to protect examples of all of alberta's natural regions by nineteen ninety-eight  can it be done  find out on next week's program   alberta has a colourful history of creating parks and protected areas  it all began with the protection of banff hot springs as a crown reserve in eighteen eighty-five  two years later in eighteen eighty-seven rocky mountains national park was established   little known to most people three national parks have been created and abolished in alberta's history  in nineteen oh eight buffalo national park was created near wainwright to protect bison   wawaskesy and nemiskam national parks were created in nineteen twenty-two to save the prong-horned antelope  all three were abolished by nineteen forty-seven because the antelope came back and bison were being protected elsewhere in wood buffalo national park  if these parks existed today though they would protect some of alberta's most endangered ecosystems   in nineteen thirty-two alberta created its first four provincial parks aspen beach gooseberry lake park lake and saskatoon island  today these small parks are among the most popular recreation sites in alberta  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   alberta has been blessed with some of the most spectacular landscapes you'll find anywhere  but as oil and gas agriculture forestry and cities push to the last frontiers the province's natural ecosystems have begun to show signs of stress  alberta's special places two thousand program seeks to ensure examples of those rare and beautiful natural landscapes are preserved for future generations  but critics argue the program is so full of holes you can drive oil rigs and logging trucks through them  today we present part three in our series on protecting alberta's endangered ecosystems  a nineteen ninety-six environics poll found that eighty-nine percent of albertans were in favour of completing a national network of protected areas even if it would result in reduced forestry and mining 
Canada	 strong public support doesn't surprise elaine sahal of the alberta wilderness association  speech, 30 sec   in fact if there's one thing history demonstrates in alberta it's public support and provincial government resistance to the idea of protected areas  biff valance is an activist but he also did some of the original work to define alberta's ecosystems in the mid nineteen seventies  speech, 1 min 15 sec   that ecosystem protection plan was called foundations for action  it came together about the time the province was negotiating to hand over more than ninety thousand square kilometres of northern forest to daishowa and al pac forestry companies for their forest management agreements  the land allocations went ahead but the parks protection plan was shelved a double whammy for ecosystem protection  biff valance explains  speech, 1 min 30 sec   according to a leaked cabinet document at the time the new special places two thousand program was designed to allow livestock grazing oil and gas development recreation tourism and other developments  alberta's nineteen ninety-five state of the environment report confirms oil and gas exploration is occurring in twenty percent of natural areas thirty-six percent of ecological reserves and in seven provincial parks  there is livestock grazing in seven parks and logging in two others  there once was logging in wood buffalo national park until the canadian parks and wilderness society sued ottawa  today there is no logging in any national park in canada  minne alsace is one of twenty-five members of the volunteer special places two thousand coordinating committee  it was set up to recommend sites for protection under the program  alsace says the committee has recommended environment minister ty lund scrap existing parks legislation  speech, 40 sec   alsace says the issue of what protected  means is a critical one  her group the canadian parks and wilderness society believes that logging and industrial development are not appropriate in areas set up to protect ecosystems  i asked when the committee expects to get a response  speech, 30 sec   the committee is also attempting to deal with the thorny issue of interim protection for areas while they're under consideration  ten months after their first meeting the coordinating committee has recommended the kazan uplands north of lake athabasca and the athabasca plain area be protected as examples of the canadian shield natural region  these recommendations now go to a local volunteer committee for more input and discussion  a decision is expected by september  i asked minnie alsace if she thinks a protected areas system will be finished by nineteen ninety-eight as promised  speech, 30 sec   with only four or fewer of the twenty natural regions protected so far there's a long ways to go  most people seem to agree the primary purpose of the special places two thousand program is to protect examples of alberta's ecosystems but that purpose is muddied by the program's many other goals which include economic development tourism recreation and heritage appreciation  according to doctor jay allanson this means that if the program is to meet its protection goals it will have to protect much more than the minimum  speech, 35 sec   nevertheless the minister's promised to finish nominations by the end of nineteen ninety-seven and complete a system of protected areas by the end of ninety-eight  alice nivens is a former reeve in the county of strathcona and currently she's in charge of transalta utilities' composter project  she's been appointed the new chair of the special places coordinating committee  i asked her if the system will be completed on time  speech, 20 sec   despite its warts ty lund's special places two thousand program is rolling along and perhaps lost in the controversy is the fact that alberta's provincial parks system has doubled in size since the program was launched  next week we begin a series on the sustainability of water in alberta   most people know alberta is home to banff canada's first national park  but did you know alberta is also home to the largest national park in the western hemisphere   at forty-four thousand eight hundred square kilometres in size wood buffalo national park is sixteen times larger than all of alberta's provincial parks combined  alberta's largest provincial protected area is willmore wilderness park  created in nineteen fifty-nine this four thousand five hundred square kilometre wilderness is larger than all of alberta's other provincial parks wilderness areas natural areas and ecological reserves combined  since nineteen thirty-two alberta has created three wilderness areas sixty-seven provincial parks fourteen ecological reserves and one hundred forty-nine natural areas  alberta's largest provincial parks are the two newest upper elbow sheep and kakwa wildland provincial parks which were recently announced as part of the special places two thousand program  in alberta only wilderness areas and national parks are legally protected from industrial or commercial development  that's it for this

yukon conference in waterton last weekend  before that we heard archie koch past president of the canadian parks and forestry initiative   wolves and grizzly bears stand as symbols of what's left of the wildness and romance of north america's frontier  that narrow band of forest crags and creeks that runs along the rocky mountains from yellowstone to yukon  over three hundred people from all over north america gathered in waterton last weekend to celebrate these magnificent animals and to join together in a new effort to protect them and other species that share their rocky mountain ecosystem

such a huge area you might think the y to y venture is just a pie in the sky dream but archie koch is quick to point out it's been done before  speech, 1 min 5 sec   one of the most fascinating results of the yellowstone to yukon conference was the convergence of thought and spirit the sense of coming together in cooperation between people from different countries and different environmental groups  the transformation did not go unnoticed by organizers archie koch and john storman   speech, 50 sec   speech, 35 sec   john storman recognizes there are many challenges ahead but selling the

  the loss of a single endangered species can have dramatic implications as the effects of this loss ripple through the ecosystem  john storman was quoting ecologist e o wilson when he reminded us just how at risk biodiversity is around the world today  speech, 1 min 30 sec   john storman was speaking at the yellowstone to yukon conference in waterton lakes national park last weekend  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   musical introduction   the northern rockies is a vast wilderness area of more than eight million hectares  shaped something like a seahorse it's tucked into the northeast corner of british columbia just west of the b c alberta border and it's home to many large mammals like elk wolves grizzly bears and caribou  last week the b c government announced a special conservation land use plan for the entire northern rockies  for heath smoot and duane boychuk it was a dream come true  it took over five years of work but the two ex-loggers-cum-environmentalists eventually convinced the government oil companies natives and others to share in their dream of protecting the northern rockies  as heath smoot explains their success lies in their approach  speech, 45 sec interview between a and z and za, 8 min 30 sec   heath smoot is with the canadian parks and forestry initiative in jacksons british columbia  duane boychuk is a member of the chapman  environmental society  both men were instrumental in establishing the northern rockies conservation area  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  up next tammy schroeder with this week's ecofacts and trends   did you know that british columbia has one quarter of the world's coastal temperate rainforest or that yellow warblers you see nesting in the forest near lac la biche spend their winters in belize central america  it's connections like these that interest calgary's rain forest action group  whether it's pesticide use in central america's rainforests or warblers in alberta's boreal forest the rainforest action group attempts to link global ecological cause with effect  often the small group raises awareness by hosting fundraisers around a particular issue  this thursday october twenty-third the issue is temperate rainforests in british columbia and the future of spirit bears and pacific salmon  the event will be held at the hard rock cafe in calgary and ecofile's albert lodge will be there to host the evening  the event celebrates world rainforest week and proceeds will go to the valhalla society's great bear rainforest project  the dino martinis

and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   musical introduction   roland lemon calls himself the mad cowboy and for twenty years he's travelled north america telling people why he's a fourth generation cattle rancher who no longer eats meat  his message is one about sustainability  he's deeply concerned that modern agriculture is bad for our health and our planet  in nineteen ninety-six roland lemon was elected president of the international anti-meat-eating association   in nineteen ninety-seven he appeared on the oprah winfrey show to talk about mad cow disease  the controversy led to a lawsuit against himself and oprah by the texas cattlemen's association  lemon won  i spoke with roland lemon when he recently visited alberta on a speaking tour interview between a and z, 10 min 50 sec   that was roland lemon a fourth generation cattle rancher who's now an advocate for sustainable agriculture  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  up next tammy schroeder with this week's ecofacts and trends   if you think the sorry state of the world is making you sick you're probably right  according to the world health organization about one quarter of all disease and injury appears to be linked to environmental decline  the u n organization estimates pollution causes twenty-five percent of all cancers  also poor air quality and other environmental factors are the root cause of about sixty percent of acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia and the world health organization says indoor air pollution is responsible for ninety-three percent of the three million deaths each year which are related to some kind of air pollution  environmental degradation has a significant impact on the spread of infectious diseases such as malaria and illnesses that cause diarrhea  these claim almost six million lives annually  the world health organization blames economic development that ignores social development and environmental protection and says many of these diseases could be prevented through pollution abatement as well as improvements in water quality and housing  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   on today's feature report we'll find out how alberta has responded to the challenge of sustainable development  in nineteen ninety ralph klein then the environment minister in the getty government created the alberta roundtable on the environment  the group of twenty-four people included corporate c e os environmentalists politicians and a diversity of albertans  ryan polansky from the environmental resource centre in edmonton was a member of the roundtable  i asked him why we should worry about sustainable development in alberta  speech, 40 sec   instead of trying to provide a hard definition of sustainable development the alberta roundtable presented a vision of what alberta might look like under sustainable development interview between a and z, 1 min 35 sec   after the alberta government adopted the vision of the alberta roundtable the future environmental directions for alberta taskforce was created to implement sustainable development  it was headed up by jim bauer who then worked for the environment council

Canada	 it's been almost a decade since the brundtland commission made its report in nineteen eighty-seven  critics are beginning to wonder when all the talk will become action on the ground  fred mcsweeny is with the pembina institute for appropriate development in drayton valley  speech, 2 min 5 sec   jim bauer of alberta environmental protection is now involved with a government review of the recommendations of the taskforce  the taskforce recommended some fairly progressive ideas such as the use of full-cost accounting a review of fees and taxes for their effect on sustainable development and that alberta's system of protected areas be completed  speech, 10 sec   as is the case with things economic the federal government is creating an independent auditor of sustainable development  in alberta however there is no formal monitoring of our progress on sustainable development  the alberta roundtable did come up with fifty-nine indicators for measuring sustainable development but most of these indicators are not being used in the government's annual report  the majority of indicators are still traditional measures of economic performance such as g d p jobs and the cost of transportation  but that's only half of the sustainable development equation  what's missing are indicators that would raise red flags signalling threats to the environment  i asked fred mcsweeny if there are indicators that could help balance off the economic ones already in place  speech, 1 min 15 sec   there's a flurry of sustainable development activity going on inside government but it's hard to see results on the ground  this radio series was inspired by the alberta roundtable report  throughout this series we will assess alberta's progress on the fifty-nine indicators of sustainable development identified by the roundtable  that's it for our feature report   technology may not hold all the answers to creating a sustainable future but according to tim lee at a g t limited the creation of fibre optics has radically improved the efficiency of telecommunications  fibre optic wires are made out of plain everyday sand  not only is the process of mining sand far cleaner than mining copper the wires are one thousand times more efficient  this means one pair of fibre optic wires can handle thirty thousand telephone calls at once compared to just twenty-four on a pair of old-fashioned copper wires  when it comes to alberta's wetlands the story is not quite so positive  according to alberta environmental protection the number of marshlands in alberta declined by more than thirty percent between nineteen seventy and nineteen ninety  to try and save wetlands the north american waterfowl management plan was created and the alberta government is also creating a wetland policy for alberta   time will tell if the trend can be reversed   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   alberta's economy runs on natural resources  from the oil and gas industry to the coal-fired power plants that provide our electricity alberta's dependent on its natural resources  agriculture forestry and tourism round off a suite of renewable natural resources that albertans depend on  how does a province of oil barons loggers miners and farmers deal with some very real global environmental problems  today we asked ty lund alberta's minister of the environment what alberta's doing to create a sustainable future  in alberta perhaps unlike anywhere else in canada people are reminded of their dependence on natural resources every two weeks when they collect their paycheques  most jobs in alberta are linked in some way to the exploitation of natural resources  oil and gas still make up a majority of provincial revenues  ty lund knows this well  he's the minister of the environment and a two-term conservative m l a member of the legislative assembly from rocky mountain house  i asked ty lund what he thinks the big sustainable development issues are for alberta  speech, 15 sec   lund's concerns about greenhouse gas emissions is tempered however by his concern that alberta might lose oil and gas business  in fact he says if alberta reduced production of natural gas it might be bad for the environment because those markets would still be filled by other countries with lower environmental standards  speech, 2 min interview between a and z, 1 min 40 sec   the government's annual report is chock full of economic indicators such as the amount of grain produced timber harvested or the low prices alberta charges for utilities and trucking but rarely does it look at the quality and sustainability of the ecological systems that produce the resources  the report of the alberta roundtable endorsed by the alberta government in nineteen ninety-three states there are consumption limits to the earth's resources and that the increasing rate of consumption and the exploding world population are the largest contributors to the global environmental crisis  i asked ty lund if he believes there are limits to consumption  speech, 20 sec   some scientists say we're already running a global environmental deficit but the division between those who think vigorous economic growth can save us and those who think reduced consumption can save us is the grand canyon of voids  in march nineteen ninety-five the ensuring prosperity taskforce made twenty-four recommendations to change our ways  among many suggestions it proposed the injection of sustainable development into the school curriculum and the creation of a mechanism to coordinate and implement sustainable development  i asked mister lund if all of the recommendations are being implemented  speech, 20 sec   many critics see monitoring and reporting on sustainable development progress as the achilles heel of sustainable development  they say that without transparent and independent monitoring it will be too easy to cook the books  if sustainable development is as important as the government says it is critics wonder why no one is in charge of it  the federal government is creating an independent environmental auditor like the auditor general  i asked mister lund if he's developing a similar process here  speech, 30 sec   another suggestion of the taskforce was a review of taxes and fees for their impact on sustainable development  in sweden the government there has recently reduced income tax by four percent and replaced it with environmental taxes on s o two and c o two gases related to acid deposition and global warming  speech, 15 sec   for reaction to ty lund's ideas about sustainable development we contacted ryan polansky   he was a member of the alberta roundtable on the environment and economy  speech, 55 sec   in a natural resource dependent province like alberta sustainable development may be one of the most challenging issues we will face in coming years  next week we begin our exploration of the alberta roundtable's fifty-nine indicators of sustainable development  that's it for our feature report  you're listening to the chevron ecofile   preserving biodiversity is a key element of sustainable development but have you ever wondered how many species of life there are in canada  according to ted mosquin don mcallister and peter whiting the authors of a new book on canada's biodiversity there are seventy-one thousand species of life in canada   but those are only the discovered species  the scientists estimate there are sixty-eight thousand more species not yet discovered by science and for each species of life there is at least one more species of virus  if you're keeping tabs the answer is there are two hundred eighty thousand species of life in canada   when you factor environmental costs into things the results can be surprising  according to the world watch institute burning a gallon of gasoline in the u s costs the driver about one dollar twenty cents but it can cost the country another three dollars in medical bills and property damage from smog and other side effects   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   it's nine a m on a hot summer day  the morning rush hour is over and there's a yellow brownish haze hanging over the city  todd matlock is an air quality analyst with alberta environmental protection  speech, 1 min 5 sec   if that day were a fall day and there was a strong temperature inversion you might be experiencing one of alberta's rare poor air quality days  today we'll try to find out whether air quality is getting better or worse in alberta   according to jimmy siegel of alberta's air monitoring branch urban air quality is improving in alberta  speech, 20 sec interview between a and za, 20 sec   alberta's air quality index reports on the status of five major pollutants carbon monoxide dust and smoke nitrogen dioxide ozone and sulphur dioxide  the air quality index rates air quality in seven cities and towns as good fair poor or very poor  jimmy siegel is with alberta's air monitoring branch  speech, 20 sec   you can find out the current air quality index by calling  four one seven seven one seven nine in edmonton and two five seven two seven one one in calgary  the picture painted by alberta's air monitoring branch is actually quite rosy  dozens of slick brochures itemize dramatic improvements in a number of areas  but according to deborah kostiuk an environmentalist from rocky mountain house there are some problems  kostiuk worries that carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions are rising and that monitoring in rural alberta is inadequate  she's also worried about high ground level ozone levels in rural areas and the emerging issue of acid aerosols pollutants that form when acids in the air combine with fine particulates  in nineteen ninety the government released the clean air strategy for alberta  it presented a comprehensive new blueprint for air quality management in alberta  soon after the clean air strategic alliance or casa was formed  it's up to casa to implement the clean air strategy  tim feely is the executive director of casa  speech, 1 min 55 sec   one of the first airshed groups to form was the west central airshed society  tom wilfred of weldwood canada in hinton is the group's chair  speech, 20 sec   in the early nineteen eighties the unmistakable odour of poisonous sour gas poured over the region when the lodgepole sour gas well blew  after that experience residents wanted better air quality monitoring   the airshed covers an area that runs from the berland river in the north along the alberta b c border to a line north of rocky mountain house and east almost as far as wabamun lake  the monitoring will cost seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and will include biological monitoring sites where alfalfa saskatoons and even forests will be monitored for the effects of air pollution  speech, 25 sec   some fifty companies now contribute to the airshed agency and  wilfred says this should mean better monitoring and higher public credibility  speech, 40 sec   since funding is provided on a polluter-pay basis it may be possible for industry to reduce its levy  speech, 20 sec   the clean air strategic alliance is working to get other regional airshed groups started as well  that's it for our feature report  next week we'll zero in on one of the most troubling pollutants of all  one observer told us he hasn't seen a mobilization of industry around an issue like this since love canal  you can't see it or smell it but increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide could change the world you live in  we'll find out what alberta's doing about global warming next week  alberta is one of the leading producers of sulphur dioxide pollution in canada  sulphur dioxide is a key cause of acid rain or acid deposition  second only to ontario alberta produces six hundred forty thousand tonnes of s o two each year  most of the s o two pollution comes from natural gas processing the tar sands and power plants   because of prevailing winds about seventy percent of alberta's s o two pollution is exported to other places like saskatchewan the northwest territories and ontario   according to one estimate alberta is responsible for nine percent of the acid deposition in northern ontario   on the good news side of things some air quality trends in edmonton and calgary are positive  thanks to improving car technology carbon monoxide pollution is down by more than fifty percent since nineteen eighty and the use of unleaded gasoline has helped reduce lead pollution by ninety-six percent over the same period of time   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   on one of those spring days when the thermometer drops below minus twenty degrees celsius it's just plain hard to take global warming seriously but according to researchers at the national climatic

Canada	 jose lopez portillo was the president of mexico from nineteen seventy-six to nineteen eighty-two   he ascended to his presidency on the wave of new petroleum discoveries and the opec oil bonanza  it seemed as if mexico was well on its way to achieving full economic development   so what happened   lopez portillo used mexico's oil to borrow additional capital in an ambitious plan to turn his nation from a third to a first world country  his strategy made sense initially   petroleum prices were expected to rise well into the eighties   commercial bankers in other countries were eager to lend money to mexico in an attempt to recycle the billions of petrol dollars that arab countries had placed on deposit with them   this lending strategy seemed to work well for the first years of portillo's term   huge investments were made in roads ports and heavy industry   the economy boomed and hundreds of thousands of new jobs were created   unprecedented spending occurred in areas such as health and education   the greater availability of wealth also translated into an astronomical increase in governmental waste and corruption   as the international playing field changed in nineteen eighty-one  mexico's heydays of success and overnight riches ground to a halt   oil prices began to fall in response to the collapse of the opec cartel and the economic recession in the united states and other industrialized countries   lopez portillo thinking that the price downturn was nothing but a temporary blip in an otherwise upward curve continued his ambitious spending   he replaced oil revenues with massive amounts of foreign borrowing  the bubble finally burst in nineteen eighty-two when the international banking community effectively cut mexico off   lopez portillo was unable to obtain enough money to service his government's existing debts   with his term drawing to a close and knowing that he would forever be remembered as the president who mortgaged the country to ruin he nationalized the mexican banking system   now the rationale for that was to stop the huge flight of capital that was occurring out of mexico  mexican bankers and industrialists had panicked and millions of dollars were sent to safety in the united states and europe   portillo's actions came too late however to stop the draining of millions of dollars from the national reserve   after portillo's term was over the new president on the block was de la madrid who was elected in nineteen eighty-two   initially de la madrid did not differ greatly from portillo in his ultimate vision for mexico   he too wanted to bring mexico within his term into the private club of the first world nations  economically though things went from bad to worse   at the beginning of his term mexico was still able to get forty dollars per barrel of oil on the international market   only four years later that price would plummet to ten dollars per barrel   facing an eighty-five billion dollar debt de la madrid imposed harsh austerity measures  imports were cut   the public sector was slashed   government-owned corporations were privatized and government subsidies to all groups were reduced   by nineteen eighty-five mexican officials decided that this i m f style of reform wasn't working  instead the country would have to become more outwardly focused  more competitive and more export-oriented   de la madrid moved quickly onto the fast track removing import licences reducing tariffs and courting foreign investors  one of his major decentralization move moves  focused on the northern border region the maquiladora area  approximately three hundred plants were owned by u s companies at that time   the maquiladora factories employed more than forty thousand mexican workers and produced five hundred millions dollars worth of goods annually   this area alone didn't make much of an impact in the economic equation though   because in nineteen eighty-five interest payments alone came to a staggering fourteen billion dollars more than fifty-five percent of the country's export earnings   with the implementation of economic reforms the gap between the very poor and the very rich grew exponentially  by the mid-eighties for every hundred pesos that a poor mexican was earning two thousand pesos would be pocketed by a rich mexican  the funds that had been channeled towards social programs during lopez portillo's reign all but dried up   even though both the middle and upper classes had grown substantially since the turn of the century the poorest element of society still constituted the largest percentage of the total population   since the nineteen thirties peasants have been migrating to urban areas in ever increasing numbers and this movement has exploded since the early eighties  this migratory flood hasn't been adequately planned for by government pundits and the strain that's been put on the public services  has created a permanent underclass living at the bottom level of urban society  the informal work sector has been flooded by people of all ages  who try to scratch out a living polishing shoes selling newspapers or any number of cheap goods in the street   urban dwellers who have traditionally been seen by the mexican government as potential sources of political instability have traditionally had their basic food stuffs subsidized   beans flour and tortillas as well as commodities such as gas public transportation and electricity had all been covered  the de la madrid administration decided that it could no longer afford the scale of subsidies so a harsh blow was dealt to the urban poor  tensions are likely to increase as more mexicans continue to flood from politically isolated rural settings to urban ones  with greater access to information on politics and governmental mismanagement fertile ground exists for popular political organization  a prime example of urban discontent was seen immediately following the earthquake which devastated mexico city in nineteen eighty-five  the government was painfully slow in the area of reconstruction and so non-governmental groups mobilized and completed the work largely through their own efforts   by nineteen eighty-seven the austerity measures and the tightening of the mexican economic belt on the part of the private sector  resulted in an unemployment rate of eighteen percent   another twenty-five to thirty-five percent of the population was underemployed in jobs that barely provided for their basic needs  between nineteen eighty-two and nineteen eighty-seven real minimum wages fell about forty-two percent and the could be very fast 'there were' record inflation rates  the only group that wasn't left scarred by the abysmal economic situation was the very wealthy   until nineteen eighty-eight the governing party the institutional revolutionary party or the p r i had been able to deflect the blame for the poor economic performance on others the church greedy corrupt bureaucrats and money-grubbing foreigners   the p r i has been called the best hidden dictatorship in the world  it's retained exclusive power for the last seventy-odd years  and has proved itself remarkably adept until recently at adapting to whatever political crisis may be thrown its way   the governing p r i has been able to survive until now because of its rather octopus-like structure  its political tentacles have reached into all sectors of society  from labour to big business   in the past the regime proved itself capable of responding to serious threats to its authority by enacting reforms that undercut popular resentment   widespread agrarian reforms in the early part of the century  were probably the best example of this undercutting   the land reforms were reduced   peasant discontent and land pressures at the same time  such a modern day panacea is not forthcoming however   popular resentment came to a head in the nineteen eighty-eight national elections as support for the p r i for the first time ever  declined sharply   the revolutionary nationalist image that was seventy years in the making for p r i governments is beginning to look a bit shoddy   one of the principal continuous platforms of the p r i has been that mexico must be politically sovereign   the giving up of national economic sovereignty to foreign adjustors primarily americans does not fit well with mexican public  they see that it is not just the domestic market that is under siege but mexican foreign policy as well   an outstanding example of mexico's loss of integrity was seen in their dealings with central america   the american government demanded that mexico cease and desist with all oil shipments to ortega's nicaragua   they were also strongly advised to back off from any  involvement in the central american peace proposals which were hotly opposed by washington   mexico was and still is strongly affected by the wishes of its creditors  it rapidly kowtowed to the de demands  of the reagan administration dealing a blow to its already shaken international image   perhaps even more damaging than the perceived loss of external political sovereignty has been the breakdown of traditional shock-absorbing groups within mexico   the p r i in its octopus form through coercion or co-option  had given an institutional voice to labour the peasantry and the popular sector   these three groups had guaranteed access to participate in the decision-making that affected their groups  however with the implementation of austerity measures the ability of these groups to negotiate and to find solutions to their  members' demands has been greatly reduced   the trade union confederations lost their ability to win benefits for union members   they were also unable to maintain wage and employment levels   as workers saw a rapid decline in their living standards and their inability to match their wages to rapidly rising prices discontent has grown  the p r i corporate octopus is crumbling   as disillusionment with the p r i becomes widespread and individuals within mexican society begin to agitate new social movements have begun to emerge   for the most part they've been limited in their focus revolving oftentimes around a single specific interest   without the promise of benefits from the government these voices are no longer being incorporated into or silenced by the monolithic government structure   the decline of the institutional revolutionary party in mexico  is a result of the fact that it can no longer hand out the cookies and carrots that it has grown accustomed to   traditionally mexican politics were defined by who got the resources and benefits rather than by popular representation   now the p r i's actions are restricted by the economic handcuffs which it has assumed   the political crisis which is occurring now is a direct result  of political inability to control the economy   the increasing rich-poor gap the squeezing of austerity measures on those classes that can least bear them and the disintegration of traditional channels of communication between the p r i monolith and society have all given fuel to the political crisis   the economic bust after years of petrol plenty have meant that the p r i is no longer able to co-opt and assimilate dissenting voices   the economic crisis of the eighties has been the root cause of the present-day political crisis in the mexican system   unless the price of oil skyrockets again or platinum is found in copious amounts on mexican soil the morally and economically bankrupt mexican government will have difficulty stemming the tumultuous wave of change which is sure to come  for central america breaking the silence i'm anna smith   cabs 1-2  the demonstrators predict president carlos salinas will die in election year after stepping out of a cabinet meeting where he's told pollution is under control and yet chokes to death for lack of oxygen  i feel some days myself as if i could choke to death   today's paper says there was no thermal inversion yesterday so that means the air quality index today is unsatisfactory  the lead content is sixty percent above the accepted maximum  ozone is rated at one hundred and ninety that's just eleven points away from being considered dangerous   and there is always a permanent oily smell in the air   among foreigners anyway when greeting fellow countrymen the talk is never first of the weather as it often is in say the frigid climate of edmonton but rather the pollution  and apparently i've chosen a bad time to be here because the conditions are supposedly worse in the so-called winter which we're in now  environmental groups plan to hold rallies every month to force the government into some sort of action  the environmental groups want very radical steps  they wanna want to cut down on very severely on the use of cars in the inner city 
Canada	 people in canada use stationary bicycles to lose weight and then hop in their cars to go to work  we waste enormous amounts of food and energy  it doesn't seem fair that we waste while the poor starve  in canada we have many desirable accessories but at the expense of the poorer countries  we hoard many of the earth's resources to make us happy but we also make the south suffer  in canada i live in comfort i s but in colombia i see my friends struggling  i want to share my wealth give the things i own but don't need to people who do need them  why can't adults share as well   we never seem to be satisfied with what we have  we always want more for ourselves but we must break the selfish habit to learn to share our wealth  i'm here in brazil to tell the leaders of the rich country that we don't want to be so greedy anymore  to forgive the international debt and share our technology freely  any child can see that we need to share  thank you audience claps   french comments   as a child i have a hard time being heard and understood  but children experience nature in a way quite different from adults  i'm here to tell you now that i am not afraid to speak up for what i believe in and i believe in children  the purpose of these conferences is to create a healthy sustainable environment yet who are the ones we are making the decisions for  the children  and their futures should be of the utmost importance on your agendas  we are tomorrow's leaders and voters  we are the future keys to the earth's survival  we take every decision as an example for the way we will run  tomorrow's world  and frankly adults have not been setting a very good example  my an my grandmother used to tell me about fields where elephants and humans lived in harmony or places where if you were lost in the forest all you had to do was look for a certain tree or animal and you could find your way home  but now those animals are almost gone and i grieve for their loss  i sometimes wonder what kind of undiscovered species are disappearing from our planet  our clear-cut and burned forests leave us leave them nowhere to go  or what cures for our diseases lie within those forests   many a time i wish i could see an elephant or a panda bear in the wild or at least know they're there  but i realize that these animals are disappearing along with countless others  there are some that i wish to see that are already gone killed by poachers and hunters some pov sometimes impoverished sometimes rich  now i must tell you that i am scared  this speech was not written by an adult wanting to protect a major corporation  it was written by myself a child who has no hidden agendas and no companies to protect  i only wish to protect my future and those of other children  who are not able to speak today   help us before it is too late  we have no time to lose  please do it for the children  do it for our futures  thank you audience claps   i j i don't think it's  right for me to continue speaking after that  thank you very much   i think uh children have a way of cutting through a lot of the  complexities that adults create and seeing what the issues are in a very very simple and straightforward way  i thank you very much for sharing that with us   almost two thirds of alberta is forested  university of alberta professor doctor george landsend  explains what alberta's forests are like and where they came from  taped phone interview with guest speaker   from the beautiful and remote boreal forests of the far north  to the pure stands of lodgepole pine in the foothills alberta's blessed with a diversity of forests but not with a large number of species of trees  in fact just six species aspen white spruce  lodgepole and jack pine balsam poplar and black spruce make up ninety-seven percent of the volume of wood on alberta's so-called productive forest land  the province considers just over half of the forest land or thirty-five percent of alberta as productive commercial forests  the theory of modern sustained yield forest management is that if it takes a hundred years to grow a tree you only cut one one-hundredth of the trees each year  and if you do that you'll be able to cut trees forever  ron lowen is a well-known authour and a widely respected ecologist  i asked him if current forest management practices are sustainable taped phone interview with guest speaker   in fact of the seven foresters we interviewed including two well-known independent ecologists a former chief forester of a private company three prominent government foresters and one academic none would say our forests are sustainable under present management  i asked ron lowen what are the indicators that our forests aren't sustainable taped phone interview with guest speaker   essentially ron lowen is saying that the model of sustained yield forest management was designed to meet economic objectives but it doesn't protect biodiversity or the other non-fibre values in the forest and as a consequence it may not even ensure a sustained yield of fibre over the long-term  alberta's first pulp mill was opened in nineteen fifty-four in hinton by northwestern pulp and power limited  it was about that time when reg loomis alberta's first professional forester took the reins on behalf of the government  using aerial photographs he pioneered management of alberta's forest on a sustained yield basis  the theory is that timber harvesting will be forever sustainable  if you cut only the amount of wood that grows each year  in essence you live off the interest of tree growth without ever cutting into the principal  it was a very progressive concept and loomis made sure the concept worked its way into the province's very first forest management agreement  today there is growing recognition that forests especially public forests should be managed to sustain everything in the forest not just the volume of timber  john laberman is a forestry consultant with the forestry company in mcbride british columbia  he used to be the chief forester of ziedler forest products in edmonton  i asked him if what we're doing in the forests is sustainable  taped phone interview with guest speaker   luke lakeside is a forester with the alberta government  he is working on the model forest in hinton and the province's forest conservation strategy  he disagrees with ron lowen on the question of fibre sustainability  he thinks in most instances fibre production is sustainable but he does agree that sustainable forest management is more than just fibre production taped phone interview with guest speaker   in fact there's a quiet revolution going on in the woods  driven by the potentially explosive repercussions of the marketplace a new kind of forestry may be emerging  simon lionel a forester with the land and forests service  says the move is from sustained yield to sustainable forest management taped phone interview with guest speaker   by now you're probably beginning to realize that sustainability in the forest can be a bit of a shell game  but the debate is about sustaining forests and not just trees  next week we'll try to find out what forest sustainability is  and what's being done to ensure alberta's forests are going to be around for future generations end of show segment introduction to next show   forests cover about two-thirds of alberta and most of the forest is relatively young  about seventy percent is less than a hundred and twenty years old  fire is probably the most important natural force in alberta's forest ecosystems  more than seventy-five percent of alberta's forests have burned in the last fifty years and unlike the temperate rainforests of b c  british columbia alberta's forests are composed mostly of a half dozen species or so  one out of every two trees in alberta is an aspen  aspen is that handsome white bark tree seen in groves throughout the province's forested ecosystems  aspen and balsam poplar are in the salicaceae family along with willows and this is where acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin was derived from  in fact almost half of the medicines prescribed today were originally derived from plants and that is partly why protecting biodiversity in forests has become a world-wide issue   in nineteen eighty-five only about one quarter of the annual allowable cut of trees was allocated to forest companies in alberta  the annual allowable cut is calculated based on the annual growth rate of trees  if a tree takes one hundred years to grow then your allowable cut is one one-hundredth of the trees in your forest  today ninety-five percent of the coniferous or pine spruce and fir allowable cut has been allocated and seventy-three percent of the deciduous trees such as aspen have been promised to forestry companies  more public forest lands have been allocated to forestry operations in the last decade than in all of alberta's previous history  it was the government of premier donald getty that looked to forestry when alberta faced plunging oil prices in the mid nineteen-eighties  as a sustainable development strategy the concept of harvesting trees may not be a bad idea but in the headlong rush to develop alberta's northern forests some critics argue wildlife biodiversity and science were left behind  today spurred on by environmental protests abroad and controversy at home forest companies are making changes  overharvesting in british columbia and some very public fights over pollution and allocation of the public forests in alberta have tarnished forestry's image  the industry's scrambling to improve its image and protect its markets  in the early nineteen-nineties the alberta government's answer was to write a new vision for government that called for ecosystem sustainability  it was largely a symbolic beginning but the word ecosystem had finally crept into the practice of forestry  samuel lamberthad is a policy advisor with the alberta government taped phone interview with guest speaker   ecosystem sustainability may have become part of the language of the day but the indicators of success in forestry were still annual allowable cut and reforestation  both are indicators of fibre production but not forest sustainability  in last week's program nearly every forester we spoke to agreed that what's being practised today is sustained yield management and not sustainable forest management  understanding the difference between these two concepts is critical in sorting out the important issues in forestry today  doctor mark lathe is the ecologist who wrote the book on canada's forest ecosystems  he's the authour of canada's areas of foliage and more recently he wrote home short pieces on ecological subjects   i asked him how he would define sustainable forest management  taped phone interview with guest speaker   lathe's idea is to pass the forests on to our children  in the same condition as they were given to us  this sounds reminiscent of sustainable development as defined by the united nations brentland commission  old growth forest ecologist and authour ron lowen shares  lathe's view and elaborates taped phone interview with guest speaker   ron lowen says if poor management results in a deficit  for either the choice of our children or in the land's productive capacity we will have in effect stolen resources from our children  that's how two well-known ecologists would define sustainable forest management but what about government  samantha lanolyn is the senior policy advisor who represented alberta when the canadian council of forest ministers defined sustainable forest management and created a system of indicators  taped phone interview with guest speaker   the system of eighty-three indicators created by the forestry ministers is far more complex than the loan indicator now being used by the alberta government in its annual measuring up report  it also adds significantly to the traditional indicators such as reforestation success and annual allowable cut however according to  samuel lamberthad the alberta government is also creating its own definition of sustainable forest management taped phone interview with guest speaker   critics of the forest conservation strategy charge that talk is cheap  nevertheless lamberthad says the government intends to redefine the way it does forestry based on the definition of sustainable forest management that emerges from the process  next week could sustainable forest management mean an end to clear-cuts or the creation of the largest clear-cut on earth  find out as we present part three in our series on sustainable forestry end of show segment introduction to next show 
Canada	 on today's feature report we'll try to find out what alberta's doing to prevent global warming   the irony of the greenhouse effect is that life on earth depends on a warm climate  the problem is it's a case of too much of a good thing  since nineteen sixty the concentration of carbon dioxide the most important greenhouse gas has gone from three hundred and seventeen to three hundred and fifty-seven parts per million in the atmosphere  that's a thirteen percent increase in only thirty-five years  scientists say carbon dioxide levels have not been this high for a hundred and sixty thousand years  the average global temperature has gone up too about point five degrees  this may not sound like much but the difference between now and the last ice age is only about two and a half to five degrees celsius  scientists are predicting a two and a half to five degree increase in average temperatures by the middle of the next century  i asked hubert daring of the pembina institute in drayton valley why we should worry about the greenhouse effect in alberta  speech, 1 min 5 sec   if global warming were simply a matter of ecosystems moving north perhaps the consequences wouldn't be so bad but as doctor morris sengorem of the university of calgary explains ecosystems don't change overnight  speech, 35 sec   so the climate may change enough to move an ecosystem such as the boreal forest north but the soils can't just pick up and come along for the ride  the boreal forest would essentially be caught between a heat wave and the underdeveloped soils of the sub arctic  i asked hubert daring if such outcomes represent worst case scenarios  speech, 55 sec   in nineteen ninety lucien bouchard then the federal environment minister committed canada to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand  the federal government's answer to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions is the voluntary challenge  but since nineteen ninety alberta's carbon dioxide emissions have increased by fifteen percent making alberta the largest greenhouse gas producing province in canada  jim bauer is with alberta environmental protection  speech, 45 sec   the pembina institute did an analysis of the first hundred and eighty-nine submissions to the voluntary challenge registry in ottawa and according to hubert daring the results are less than inspiring  speech, 30 sec   officials from alberta's energy department told us they're excited by the high levels of participation and that it's a question of whether the glass is half full or half empty  they say flaws in the voluntary system will be cleaned up in round two and that we have to give corporations a chance to show results  according to tim feely of alberta's clean air strategic alliance alberta's fossil fuel industries are very concerned about this issue  speech, 30 sec   but just as concern over greenhouse gases is building two of alberta's largest greenhouse gas producers are talking about major expansions  suncor and syncrude in fort mcmurray are already responsible for producing eight percent of alberta's carbon dioxide emissions  according to roland gump environmental specialist for suncor the company will reduce c o two emissions back to nineteen ninety levels by two thousand and five  this while doubling producion of oil  speech, 10 sec   in the struggle to put the brakes on global warming we know that all fossil fuels are not created equal  according to hubert daring coal produces twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas and oil produces about one and a half times as much  oil sands synthetic crude on the other hand produces ten times as much c o two as conventional crude oils says daring   this may be why some american states are so interested in alberta natural gas  if they replace coal with natural gas they could reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by as much as fifty percent  the trouble is alberta gets the c o two bill for producing the natural gas  according to hubert daring energy switching and efficiency are only part of the first step in curbing greenhouse gas emissions  speech, 45 sec   despite that fossil fuels appear to present significant and unaccounted environmental cost movements towards renewable energy continue at a snail's pace  that's it for our feature report   canada is responsible for two percent of the greenhouse gas emissions on earth  while china releases four and a half times as many greenhouse gas emissions the average canadian is responsible for seven hundred and fifty percent more emissions than the average chinese  among canadian provinces alberta is the greenhouse kingpin   not only is alberta the largest emitting province in canada carbon dioxide emissions have grown by fifteen percent since nineteen ninety   this despite canada's promise to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand   there are some glimmers of hope however  gas companies like nova are looking for ways to curb their greenhouse gas emissions   traditionally before work was done on a pipeline the gas was vented into the atmosphere  by using compressors to push the gas into sealed areas of the pipeline repair crews can now minimize the methane released while making repairs  nova estimates this one change is preventing nine thousand tonnes of methane from being released each year  methane is eleven times more potent than carbon dioxide in causing global warming   and that's it for this week's facts and trends  i'm annie gillis   jim hanley is a seasoned social and environmental activist  he organized a national grassroots campaign to protect south moresby national park on canada's west coast in the mid nineteen eighties  it was the largest and most successful park campaign ever mounted in canada involving people from coast to coast  he began this campaign after living and working with the haida people in the queen charlotte islands for almost a decade  before it was over the conservative federal environment minister of the day had kissed the earth and pledged to create a national park there   hanley later led a world tour to expose the plight of the penan people of borneo who were losing their rainforest homeland to loggers  he's traveled to more than seventy countries around the world  he is the author of numerous books including places at the edge  and a discovery a book about getting kids back in touch with the land  he spends half of his time in canada and the rest in thailand writing books and working for rainforest cultures around the world  as we in western consumer-oriented society struggle to find sustainable development solutions jim hanley has been observing helping and ultimately trying to save sustainable cultures around the globe  i asked jim hanley how he thinks canada is doing at practicing sustainable development  speech, 1 min   humans have lived on the earth for about three point five million years  for most of that time humans lived as hunter-gatherers  the population increased at a rate of about one person every five years  speech, 2 min 10 sec   hanley says we talk about sustainable forestry in alberta and british columbia but the mentawai people are actually practicing it  speech, 30 sec   the sago palm is one of more than fifteen hundred palm species in this hundred and sixty million year old rainforest ecosystem  speech, 2 min 5 sec   the mentawai culture is just one example of a so-called primitive society living and working sustainably in their ecosystem   for many of us in western society the dream of a utopian life in the serene suburbs has turned into long commutes high stress and a distinct shortage of she of leisure time  hanley's not suggeting we all immediately adopt the lifestyle of the mentawai people but perhaps their's and the cultures of others around the world can each provide a piece of the answer in our search for sustainability  next week we continue our journey through culture and sustainable development with author jim hanley   we'll find out how the penan of borneo met saks of fifth avenue in new york and how car sales in southeast asia are turning rainforests into rubber plantations  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's annie gillis with this week's ecofacts and trends   here's something a little different this week  from the recent sustainable edmonton society's striking a balance conference we present the top five future indicators of sustainability   number five  within fifteen years five percent of alberta homes have solar shingles on their roofs and they'll be producing their own heat and power   number four   in one decade ten percent of workers will leave the driving to the internet and telecommute to work from their homes   number three   after yard naturalization becomes a raging fad dandelions are no longer scorned and dozens of species of songbirds and wildlife reappear in urban neighbourhoods   number two   within a decade more community cooperatives spring up to get small grocery stores back in neighbourhoods  as a consequence local food is better marketed and more people learn the names of their neighbours  and finally the top future indicator of sustainable development is  ottawa swears of greenhouse gas emitting tar sands projects and asphalt-friendly infrastructure programs  instead the feds encourage solar power light rail transit  and the marketing of new sustainable technologies   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   last week we began our series on culture and sustainable development with an interview with author and activist jim hanley   he was the architect of the campaign to protect south moresby as a canadian national park in the mid nineteen eighties  since then he's worked tirelessly on behalf of en   the environment and rainforest people around the world  last week he described the mentawai people of seburoot in southeast asia  it's a culture that lives sustainably in one of the oldest rainforests on earth  to hanley they seem a happy and content people with enough leisure time to leave anyone in the western world aghast  today we continue our discussion with author and activist jim hanley about culture and sustainable development pipe music  in view of humanity's potential to dominate the earth albert einstein's analysis seems rather pragmatic  he said man has lost the capacity to foresee and forestall   quote continues   western society seems to have developed some capacity to foresee things  the real question remains in the forestalling department  it's perhaps why we in the so-called first world spend enormous amounts of time navel gazing and searching within our market-based system for ways of making our consumer lifestyle sustainable  but jim hanley has spent time with cultures like the mentawai of seburoot the penan of borneo and the quechua of the amazon  many of these cultures are already socially environmentally and economically sustainable  i asked jim hanley if there's anything western society can learn about sustainability from other cultures  speech, 35 sec   hanley thinks we have to get beyond the recycling stage to take seriously more challenging concepts like reduction   speech, 2 min 30 sec   in our quest to develop new markets the western world certainly seems to have become culturally imperialistic  the western consumer lifestyle's intoxicating  it's addictive  and according to hanley it's endangering sustainable cultures and mowing down rainforests throughout southeast asia  speech, 1 min 5 sec   the unbridled economic development that's racing through southeast asia today reminds hanley of canada in the nineteen fifties  in this frenzy of economic development people are not sitting around debating sustainable development  in fact hanley argues that many countries are actually moving away from sustainability  speech, 1 min 50 sec   one by one diverse and once sustainable cultures and rainforests are being swallowed in the name of economic development  speech, 40 sec   despite all this hanley remains hopeful  it will take creativity and he says some sacred notions will have to be shed along the way but there are solutions  some of which exist in other cultures  next week is forestry in alberta sustainable  join us as we try to find out if the forest and the trees will be around for future generations  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's this week's ecofacts and trends   material world a global family portrait by sierra club books demonstrates the incredible economic disparity found around the world  in terms of sustainability however it's not always the rich who are the richest  the book compares thirty families from thirty countries to illustrate the great differences in material goods and circumstances that make up rich and poor societies  of the thirty families reported on twenty-one have a t v but only nine have books  four of the thirty families had computers while five use a mortar and pestle or similar tool to grind grain for food 
Canada	 the number of people who mentioned a cleaner healthier environment as the most desired thing in their lives was one  on the other hand seventeen wished for a car or a t v  the number of guns owned by the american family in the study was four  the number of guns owned by the twenty-nine other families two  finally the percentage of income spent on food ranged from nine percent in the united states to seventy percent in thailand ninety percent in iraq and one hundred percent in albania  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm hamish lodge   borneo is the third largest island on earth  situated on the equator borneo runs twelve hundred kilometres east to west and nine hundred and sixty kilometres north to south  about eighty percent of the island is blanketed by some of the oldest rainforest ecosystems on earth  according to a book called nomads of the dawn by wade davis ian mckenzie and shane kennedy politically borneo is claimed by three nations  indonesia has the southern two thirds  brunei is an oil-rich sultanate state  and the northern states of sarawak and sabah are part of malaysia  malang foru represents the penan  they're from the high mountains of sarawak a malaysian state where more than half the population is native  we talked to malang when he was in edmonton recently about his people their plight and sustainable development music playing  thousands of indigenous people roamed the forests of borneo at the turn of the century  today only eight bands of eastern penan remain fully nomadic in the ancient rainforests of borneo  these eight bands comprise three hundred and sixty people the representatives of age-old cultures that lived in harmony with the rainforest for thousands of years  malang foru is a member of the kelabit tribe and he represents the tribes of the penan  the penan is a culture of hunter-gatherers that until not so long ago lived in perfect sustainability with the ancient rainforests of borneo  i asked malang what he thinks of sustainable development  speech, 50 sec   malang comes from a culture that has been harvesting rainforests for centuries  but whether they hunted wild boar cut down the odd sago palm or gathered fruit in the forest the forest continued to survive and evolve as it always did  today these rainforests are being logged at a breakneck pace  according to the nomads of the dawn the international tropical timber organization predicted the exhaustion of the primary forests of sarawak by the year two thousand  and there's little irony in the fact that the environment minister for sarawak owns a trading company that's doing the logging  given this context i asked malang foru what he thinks  sustainability is  speech, 40 sec   the logging in the rainforest is described by the malaysian government as sustainable  the nomadic penan of sarawak are afforded no claims to the land that they've occupied for thousands of years  not only is the sustainable lifestyle being lost entire cultures are being lost as well  speech, 55 sec   malang foru explains that this new form of so-called sustainable forestry is taking power away from their communities  he says it has to do with freedom freedom to choose how to use their own resources and freedom for their children to choose what they want to do  culture normally evolves at a painfully slow almost evolutionary pace  but for the penan of sarawak changes come like a bolt of lightening from the sky  speech, 1 min 5 sec   according to the book nomads of the dawn revenue from logging in sarawak accounts for fifty percent of the state budget   these state revenues are derived from a royalty of just two percent of the selling price of the wood mostly raw logs  only about five percent of the people of sarawk are employed in logging  on december second nineteen ninety-two malang foru  addressed the united nations' forty-seventh general assembly   recorded speech, 1 min 30 sec   malang foru was one of those kelabit people who came down from the mountains to be educated in the new world  today he's living in exile in vancouver british columbia where he continues his fight for his people and his home  in a world larger than our imagination it is sometimes too easy to stay locked inside our own economic and cultural context in our search for sustainable paths to the future  that's it for our feature report  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends  by the year twenty twenty-five more than forty percent of the world's population three billion people may experience chronic water scarcity  this according to sandra postel writing in world watch magazine  as rural populations continue to migrate to the cities they take water with them  water for agriculture is being lost  in addition ground water is being overpumped and aquifers are also being depleted in many countries   according to postel no one has tallied the potential effect on future food production   it takes up to one thousand tonnes of water to grow one tonne of grain  no one is sure where a sustainable supply of water will come from in the future  the number of large dams has climbed from five thousand in nineteen fifty to thirty-eight thousand today  but this strategy has also had many environmental side effects  as the demand for water intensifies many river deltas and coastal estuaries are losing their capacity to support fisheries  the lower reaches of china's yellow river have gone dry an average of seventy days a year in each of the last ten years  the aral sea in central asia has lost half its area and three fourths of its volume to cotton production   as a consequence twenty out of twenty-four fish species have disappeared and the fish catch of forty-four thousand tonnes per year has been lost along with sixty thousand jobs  searching for ways to sustainably use water will become critically important in maintaining environmental social and economic stability in the future  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   the penan of sarawak in the northern mountains of borneo are a nomadic people  for centuries they've wandered the remote and ancient rainforests of borneo hunting wild boar gathering fruit and harvesting the odd sago palm  the penan are among a disappearing group of people that represent the palaeolithic era a time before agriculture  according to nomads of the dawn a book about the plight of the penan it was the advent of agriculture that led to a sedentary lifestyle  modern forms of religion and the separation of humans from nature  according to the authors of the book the separation of humanity from nature set in motion a savage assault upon the earth by human societies  music   malang foru has witnessed the onslaught of modern society as it has swallowed his people in just one single generation  his opinion of development sustainable or otherwise isn't very high  speech, 50 sec   it's not hard to understand malang's perspective  he comes from a culture that lived in perfect harmony with the ancient rainforests for many thousands of years  he listens to us in western society talking about sustainability but his experience has been that modern society means logging ancient rainforests and the displacement of his people and their sustainable way of life  to malang at the very least sustainability should involve the welfare of his people and the protection of their rainforest home their culture and their way of life  i asked malang what he thinks the peoples of the planet should do to strive for sustainability  speech, 40 sec   as it is now the penan and the other rainforest peoples of borneo are relocated re-educated and the land in their old territories is handed over to logging companies  malang speaks of sharing and healthy communities as values that are critical to sustainability  but this is what's being lost as a consequence of so-called development  ironically bob tatar the author of several books on sustainability told us previously he believes sustainable development requires as much as anything a process of social evolution  he spoke of sharing revitalizing communities and the reversibility of decisions as important signals of sustainability  malang says that development has unravelled the penan's relationship with the land and each other   speech, 40 sec   according bob tatar's criteria an action needs to be reversible to be sustainable  living in the forest is a life far from the industrialized consumer world of wants and desires  the penan are a nomadic people  they operate using a concept they call malong   speech, 1 min   the next season the tree is there to be rediscovered and claimed yet again  the tree belongs to the community and to nobody at the same time  land ownership had little meaning to the penan until they were confronted by those who wanted to take it away  as a consequence the malaysian government does not recognize their claim to lands that are their traditional homelands  today only eight tribes of the penan are still living nomadic lifestyles in the mountain rainforests of sarawak  malang told us he believes sustainability can only come from local people who are closest to the land  speech, 40 min   there seems little question that industrialized society has distanced itself from nature and more than a few indigenous peoples and philosophers think it may be at the root of our cavalier attitude towards the earth  but if indigenous peoples like the penan have an answer to living sustainably with the earth as did each of our ancestors they do not believe these peoples wouldn't make the same mistakes given the same tools  speech, 45 sec   humanity has the power to permanently alter the planetary ecosystems  perhaps this is why bob tatar says part of the secret for sustainability lies in social evolution  that's it for our feature report  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends   the u s environmental protection agency just purchased fourteen ozone detecting instruments that were originally developed by scientists at environment canada  it's called the brewer spectrophotometer and it's the most accurate ozone detecting instrument in the world  according to dan rowe leader of the environment canada team that developed the instrument the brewer is about the size of a suitcase  it monitors stratospheric ozone twenty kilometres above the earth by measuring how much damaging ultraviolet radiation hits the ground  the brewer ozone detectors are sold by sytech instruments of saskatoon and the u s order is worth two million dollars  one hundred and seventy-five of the instruments are installed in thirty-five countries around the world  when used in conjunction with the satellite data the brewers ozone detectors have helped map and track the ozone hole over the antarctic  this last winter or summer for us the antarctic ozone hole was not as bad as nineteen ninety-three the worst year on record but at times ozone levels reached seventy percent below normal  over canada the hole is not quite as pronounced but in spring ozone levels can drop to eight percent below normal and in summer four percent below normal  any drop in ozone concentrations could have negative effects on humans and other forms of life  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   it was after writing a book called planet sustainable  harmonizing culture and nature that bob tatar came to a new understanding of sustainable development  like many ecologists tatar initially greeted the concept of sustainable development with a distinct lack of enthusiasm  but just a few years and four books later bob tatar's  become an advocate of sustainable development  he believes humanity can find sustainability through social evolution  today we begin the first of several discussions with ecologist and author bob tatar music   i was reminded of the issue of overconsumption recently when laura love was performing at the edmonton folk music festival  she's a performer who came from a life of poverty in the south-eastern united states and today she's a successful record producer and performer  as you can imagine her perspective is a little different from that of the average middle class north american  in one of her rhythmic and evocative songs less is more she brings her own twist to the quantity versus quality dilemma 
Canada	 but no matter what side of the tracks you're from our attitudes towards consumption will have to change to create a sustainable world  cameron weis is the university of british columbia researcher who invented the idea of the ecological footprint  it's a method of measuring humanity's impact on the earth  rees says that confusion about sustainable development is a consequence of our failure to distinguish between true development and mere growth  economist hubert neely defines growth  as an increase in size through material accretion and development  as a realization of fuller and greater potential  this is a very important distinction  as weis says growth means getting bigger while development means getting better   bob tatar believes humanity can chart a more sustainable path to the future but that it will happen only through social evolution and not through technological or scientific advancements  i began by asking bob tatar what sustainable development means to him  speech, 2 min   essentially bob tatar's describing a decision making process  if something we do today takes choices away from our children or if the land's productive capacity is reduced then a decision is not sustainable  sustainable develpoment is therefore not a question of whether it's better to consume more or less  it's a question of quality versus quantity  speech, 1 min 30 sec   to bob tatar we aren't sustainable today because we're afraid to ask the right questions  speech, 40 sec   tatar says creating a sustainable future depends on western society undergoing a period of social evolution  speech, 2 min   tatar says the secret of sustainability lies in people getting back to building quality relationships in close-knit communities  we need to get back the basic human value of valuing each other says tatar and we need to understand that a community is a reciprocal relationship between people and their landscape  that's it for our feature report  next week bob tatar returns to talk about how scientists with feelings just might help create a more sustainable world  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends  a design breakthrough in australia could make solar power competitive with coal-fired electricity in five to seven years  according to the worldwatch institute the university of south wales has designed a solar cell that is twenty-one point five percent more efficient than conventional cells   this could cut the cost of solar power generation by as much as eighty percent  meanwhile world shipments of conventional photovoltaic cells the thin silicone wafers that convert sunlight into electricity jumped by seventeen percent in nineteen ninety-five  that's the largest percentage increase in more than a decade and a signal says the institute that the industry has overcome the slowdown experienced in the early nineteen nineties  the united states led the way in nineteen ninety-five with a twenty-five percent increase in domestic purchases of solar cells and a forty percent increase in exports  japanese shipments of solar cells also grew by sixteen percent in nineteen ninety-five  sales were mostly domestic and nearly all of the growth was accounted for by the government's seventy thousand roofs project an ambitious plan to install home rooftop units  solar power may hold great potential for a sustainable future but today it still only accounts for one one hundredth of one percent of the world's electricity  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   bob tatar has testified written spoken and promoted awareness and understanding of old growth forests all over the planet  he and his former coleague gary rankin were the two key scientists behind the popularization of old growth forest ecology in the pacific northwest of the united states  if you know about the spotted owl it's partly because of their work  never before has a species of wildlife become such an icon of sustainability as the spotted owl  bob tatar lives in corvallis oregon where despite having written more than half a dozen books he still answers his own phone books his own interviews and speaks passionately about the earth and its people  today we talk to bob tatar about scientists with feelings economics with debits and staying inspired in a troubled world  bob tatar abandoned a twenty year career as a research scientist because he became frustrated by how science was being used to answer social questions  he became uncomfortable with the notion of scientists divorcing themselves from their feelings in an attempt to be purely intellectual  tatar's been consulted by first nations in canada's arctic  he's testified on behalf of old growth forests in ontario  and he's been all over the world  he's influenced the thinking of thousands of people  the reason is perhaps simple  he's passionate about life  he's passionate about ecology  and he's passionate about getting beyond conflict to a bold new sustainable world  speech, 3 min 10 sec   it's true that arrogance sometimes accompanies knowledge  at one time it seemed obvious the world was flat and that the sun revolved around the earth  that was the state of the art at the time  but nature is a little more complicated than that and tatar  warns our desire to manage nature could threaten human survival  he also takes aim at technology like the internet that tends to isolate us from each other  speech, 1 min 20   tatar believes a little social evolution would not only create healthier and happier people but it would also help solve environmental and economic problems as well  it's hard not to become depressed when you consider such weighty issues as the environment the exploding population and the many social and economic problems that confront us today  i asked tatar how he keeps motivated and how he keeps writing books one after another  speech, 1 min 50 sec   what does your garden look like   response, 50 sec   tatar says if you're concerned about creating a sustainable world you should start by asking yourself what sustainability means to you  he suggests ask yourself what is the gift you have to offer your neighbour  then go over there introduce yourself and begin rebuilding a sustainable community  that's it for our feature report  if you're interested in bob tatar's ideas you might want to check out his new book called sustainable environment development  from saint harry press   however i would also recommend you consider looking up one of his previous books called forest beginnings   it's a beautiful book that juxtaposes ecological and human history through the four thousand year life of a pacific northwest old growth forest  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends  world wind power generating capacity grew by an amazing thirty-three percent in nineteen ninety-five according to preliminary estimates from the worldwatch institute  although the united states still leads the way with a total installed capacity of sixteen hundred and fifty megawatts that capacity has not increased since nineteen ninety-one  by contrast germany added five hundred and five megawatts of capacity in nineteen ninety-five the most any country has ever installed in a single year  after the u s germany has the second highest wind power generating capacity followed by denmark and india  the biggest growth area is in europe where financial incentives and high purchase prices have been established for renewable energy  according to the worldwatch institute the incentives are a response to european concern about atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel-fired power plants  in europe the technology is improving quickly as markets develop  unlike the wind farms that were developed in places like california european wind power is being generated by large capacity wind machines installed one or two at a time across the rural landscape  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   they're everywhere  when you walk down the aisles of your favourite gardening or hardware store in spring the pungent odours hit you with their distinctive unpleasant aroma  that aroma could be making you sick  that's the contention of doctor jane ewing a dermatologist from hudson quebec who's been looking into pesticide toxicity problems in humans for more than a decade  she began looking into the ill effects of pesticides in nineteen eighty-five when a patient became inexplicably ill  since then she's been working hard up against what she calls a conspiracy of silence  on today's program we'll talk to doctor jane ewing about what she's learned and what she's done music   last summer my neighbour a guy with about as much commitment to yard care as me brought out the heavy artillery to combat a relatively minor outbreak of dandelions  i didn't see it but the next day i could smell that distinctive odour of herbicide  it was easy to see where he had sprayed  the non-grass plants started growing like crazy as they rapidly curled up and died from a good dose of poison  the problem is he couldn't have read the label very well because he sprayed the stuff everywhere in his yard killing flower beds plants and half of his apple tree  i wondered how the owner of the home felt about the apple tree getting poisoned  i wondered how much of the herbicide got into our garden which is right on the fence line  this is unfortunately a perfectly normal thing that people do every year across north america and the world  when i asked doctor jane ewing why we should be concerned about the use of pesticides in our communities her answer was simple  question and answer between a and extra-corpus speaker, 3 min   ewing says when kids play in lawns they absorb pesticides through their skin and inhale it as they breathe  it was back in nineteen eighty-four when doctor jane ewing's  interest in the ill effects of pesticides first twigged  speech, 1 min 30 sec   to doctor ewing's surprise she found there were no facilities in quebec where she could test for pesticides and other poisons  this is despite the fact that the world health organization reports that there are three million pesticide poisonings every year around the world  estimates are that two hundred and twenty thousand deaths occurred in nineteen eighty-nine alone  since nineteen eighty-seven doctor jane ewing has spent more than twenty thousand dollars of her own money sending blood samples for more than eighty of her patients to accu-chem laboratories in richardson texas  speech, 1 min   so how can research even be done in canada if we can't even test for the chemicals   response, 20 min   ewing says scientists now believe that seventy to ninety percent of all cancers are caused by exposure to the suite of chemicals now in use by humans  in a world stressed at the seams chemical herbicides and other pesticides are promoted by some as a method of achieving a sustainable future  ewing thinks human health would be a lot more sustainable without them  with no labs in place to test for the toxic pesticides it means there is no record from which to research their effects  doctor ewing felt it was her duty as a physician to keep her town council aware of what she was learning about the effects of pesticides on health  speech, 1 min   it was a startling achievement  as a consequence of doctor ewing's letters and the actions of local citizens hudson quebec took the unprecedented step of banning pesticides  two chemical producers subsequently contested the hudson bylaw but lost in the quebec superior court  almost immediately the town of hudson was besieged with phone calls people asking for copies of the bylaw and the judgement  since then eighteen other quebec communities have passed pesticide bylaws although none are as sweeping as the law in hudson  just what did doctor ewing tell her town council  speech, 2 min   doctor ewing is alarmed by both the fact that facilities do not exist to properly test patients for pesticides and that such potentially dangerous substances are used so casually across canada  speech, 1 min 30 sec   doctor ewing has written to various canadian health ministers to warn them about the harmful effects of pesticides and to convince them to make testing facilities available in canada  most recently the honourable david dingwall wrote her back and indicated the government was working with chemical companies to reduce the use of pesticides  but as doctor ewing says that's a little like asking a smoker to cut down instead of quitting   that's it for our feature report   you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's this week's ecofacts and trends   the global wind energy potential is about five times the current global electricity appetite  generating electricity with the wind is considered one of the best ways to combat global warming since there're almost no environmental side effects 
Canada	 india is one of the most active markets for wind power in the world today  according to the worldwatch institute by early nineteen ninety-six india had installed enough wind turbines to generate seven hundred and thirty megawatts of power  that makes india the third largest producer of wind energy in the world  more than fifteen hundred wind turbines have been installed since the indian government opened up the electricity grid to independent power producers  in the early nineteen nineties india enacted tax incentives for renewable energy investments  one of the benefits of new wind technology is power production can be combined with agricultural production in some areas  for example according to the worldwatch institute a hectare of kansas prairie that yields about four hundred dollars worth of wheat can also produce ten thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars worth of wind generated electricity each year  in alberta legislation enacted in nineteen eighty-eight allocated a hundred and twenty-five megawatts of electricity production to alternative energy producers  to date however only one hundred and eight megawatts have been allocated to wind hydro and biomass electrical power generation projects in alberta  that's despite the fact that small power producers say they have enough proposed facilities to generate a hundred and fifty-three megawatts of power  if alberta were to reach its goal of a hundred and twenty-five megawatts the province would still be generating only one point five percent of its energy from alternative sources  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm hamish lodge   i first heard about doctor dan lowe while studying forestry at the university of alberta  from other professors it was clear that k dan lowe was a forest ecologist of some note  he wrote forest places of canada the textbook describing canada's forest ecosystems  but much more than that k dan lowe is an ecologist in the true sense of the word  he's a man who spent considerable time thinking about how things work in an ecosystem or global context  when i began work on a magazine about canada's wilderness and ecology k dan lowe was an advisor stopping on every word to clarify hidden meanings and questionable ecological assumption  today k dan lowe is a retired professor of ecology living in new denver british columbia  it's been seven years since he wrote his landmark book entitled  our place in which he analyzes humanity's place in the world  then a month ago a colleague sent me an email note complete with a photograph taken just a day or so earlier  the picture was of k dan lowe getting arrested blockading a logging road in the slocan valley near new denver british columbia  interview between a and extracorpus speaker, 9 min 50 sec   doctor dan lowe is a retired professor of ecology and an author of books and numerous essays on ecological thinking  he believes that jobs are still the ticket to the political banquet known as power but that political strategies without ecological foundations will eventually collapse in on themselves  if you're interested in this topic he suggests several books  the case against the global economy edited by jerry mander and edward goldsmith  the other book is the way an ecological worldview also by edward goldsmith  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here are this week's ecofacts and trends   ever paused to think about where that stuff you just poured down the drain goes   that's the idea behind trout unlimited yellow fish road program   volunteers usually school children or guide and scout groups paint yellow fish on all of the storm drains in their area   the idea is to get people thinking about what goes down the drain  jay stanway of trout unlimited says in the past people have put everything from turpentine to car oil and paint down the drain  the yellow fish is a reminder to people that fish and other creatures live in the rivers and that we also depend on those same rivers and streams for clean drinking water   what goes down the drain goes into the river  since the program began in nineteen ninety-one trout unlimited estimates that across canada more than sixty thousand storm drains have been painted and seven hundred thousand homes have been reached with the educational yellow fish road door hangers  the educational message is simple  whether you're washing the car or cleaning around the house use non-toxic products whenever possible  for information on the yellow fish road program contact trout unlimited in calgary at one eight hundred nine zero one two zero four zero   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   the sight of a clear-cut is enough to bring tears to the eyes of many environmentalists  clear-cut has become synonymous with  moonscape   when people think of a clear-cut forest they think of vast seas of stumps open areas devoid of wildlife and subject to erosion  doctor dan lowe is not a fan of clear-cut logging although he believes the controversial method is somewhat misunderstood by the public and what the public must do is step beyond clear-cuts and look at the bigger picture of forest management  dan lowe is now in his late seventies a forest ecologist who wrote the textbook on canada's forest ecosystems  and most recently he's known as the author of our place   he grew up in alberta and now lives in new denver british columbia where he's fighting plans to clear-cut the slocan valley near his home  i asked him about clear-cutting forests  speech, 2 min 30 sec question and answer between a and z, 6 min   doctor dan lowe is a respected forest ecologist  he lives in new denver in the slocan valley in british columbia  next week we'll find out about alternatives to clear-cutting from doctor dan egan   he's a biologist from the university of alberta who now heads up a research program on forest ecosystem management for alberta pacific forest industries  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  coming up next tammy schroeder with this week's ecofacts and trends   the prince edward island nature trust is using caution signs to help save endangered piper plovers  in a province with very little natural habitat left to protect signs and armies of volunteers are a good way to help these beach-loving birds  mary goodale of the island nature trust says piping plover numbers are down again this year  she estimate the p e i population at only sixty birds  that's down from sixty-five last year and forty percent down from just five years ago   piping plovers depend on cobbly beaches for their nesting habitat and this unfortunately puts them at odds with beach-loving humans   inside p e i national park piping plovers receive protection and they seem to be doing very well  goodale's group tries to help the piping plovers outside the national park   with some money from the federal government and world wildlife fund and many volunteers the nature trust patrols beaches and erects temporary signs around nests  they cannot legally prevent people from walking through nest areas  they instead try to educate and ask for voluntary assistance in protecting the plovers  unfortunately the numbers of piping plovers in atlantic canada are still declining   goodale says endangered species legislation more volunteers and steady funding are needed to save the endangered piping plover  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   least-cost logging that's how ecologist doctor dan lowe  defines clear-cutting  as we heard last week on the chevron ecofile he believes forest companies must begin practising more sustainable methods of logging  that's exactly what alberta pacific forest industries is trying to accomplish in north-eastern alberta  the company harvest aspen from the boreal forest to make pulp  but instead of clear-cutting the company's launched a massive long-term experiement in ecosystem management of the forest  this includes leaving clumps of trees and woody debris on the cutblocks to help maintain the biodiversity of the area  doctor dan egan is a biologist and an adjunct professor at the university of alberta who now heads up the environmental research team for alberta pacific  he explains this new approach is one that attempts to emulate natural disturbance regimes  speech, 1 min 45 sec   you can easily see the difference between al-pac's cutblocks and those of other companies  as doctor dan egan points out research has lead to the development of different methods of logging  speech, 1 min   generally government rules dictate that all merchantable trees that is those that are of a size and quality that can be sold must be removed from a cutblock  hence the clear-cuts  so al-pac is going against the grain by leaving merchantable timber on its cutblocks in the interest of maintaining biodiversity  according to doctor dan egan on average that amounts to about eight percent of the merchantable volume on a cutblock  speech, 1 min 25 sec   doctor dan egan believes it will take t  fifteen to twenty years before science can give a definitive answer on this new method of logging  however he recognizes it's unrealistic to expect forest companies to stop logging while the scientists do their research  so the main concern becomes one of adapting forest management techniques as new information comes to light  speech, 50 sec   as doctor egan is quick to point out no one can be complacent  the scientists must be looking for warning signs that the experiment is going off-track  also there are issues like global climate change which can effect the forest ecosystem  speech, 1 min 5 sec   moving from the world of academics to that of industry has been a major step for doctor dan egan   speech, 25 sec   doctor dan egan is a biologist and adjunct professor at the university of alberta  he is also environmental sciences research coordinator for alberta pacific forest industries  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  up next is tammy schroeder with this week's ecofacts and trends   rising grain prices may be the first global indicator that tells us we are on a path that is not sustainable  for almost fifty years grain prices have declined as productivity has steadily increased  that all came to an end in nineteen ninety-four when wheat prices began rising soaring thirty-nine percent over three years   that's according to wilfred grey of the worldwatch institute  grey says the reason grain production is slowing down has to do with the deterioration of the earth's ecosystem   this may not immediately effect affluent people but for the one point three billion people who live on a dollar a day or less grey  says such a rise in price could be life threatening  eventually third world political instability could affect multinational corporations the stock markets and the international monetary system  in short it could disrupt economic progress worldwide   according to wilfred grey achieving a balance between food and people depends as much on family planners as on farmers  also decisions made in energy departments that could affect climate stability may have as much an effect on food security as decisions made in agriculture departments  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   when i was in university i took several courses in outdoor recreation and parks management  one of the central concepts of leisure studies at the time was that technology would eventually create so much leisure time there'd be a never-ending demand for parks and recreation managers  as of today i now count eight months as the sum total of time i spent working on my parks and recreation career  and even that is stretching it somewhat since all of that time was spent working as a photographer and not a manager for alberta provincial parks  i worked ten days on and four days off  i was on what they called flex time  that meant no one punched a clock and no one looked over your shoulder to see if you worked thirty-seven and a half hours a week  it actually worked out very well and my less than scientific observation was that most people were keen and probably worked longer hours than they were paid for  so what happened to increasing leisure time  how many people do you know have more leisure time and are not unemployed  today we'll talk to author and activist jim hanley about a culture that's not only sustainable they have more than twenty-three hours a day for sleep and leisure 
Canada	 tape starts mid sentence and she was one of the early women graduates from trinity college in toronto in eighteen eighty-eight  at a time when male physicians were predicting that higher education for women weakened developing wombs and produced disorders such as infertility the inhibition of lactation in nursing mothers serious mental disturbance and pelvic distortion presumably from sitting too much  crowd laughter   in eighteen ninety-one undaunted clara brett martin presented a formal petition to the law society of upper canada for admission as a student at law  this is the first record we have in canada written record i emphasize that of a female applicant  which is not to suggest that there weren't women before her who desired to go and who may have made informal enquiries  this is our first written record  the benchers of the law society rejected her application in the first of what would be a series of law society votes against her admission  the canada law journal put it succinctly  quotation   it would take two separate statutes of the provincial parliament  lobby forces mounted by very very prominent women in the community such as emily stowe the first white woman doctor and lady aberdeen the wife of the governor general and the founder of the national council of women of canada and six more years before clara brett martin would finally achieve success  during her articling experience she was described by fellow students as a very odd sort of woman a rebel and in later years as a queer old duck  she survived taunting hissing and classroom sexual harassment equivalent to that experienced by emily stowe one of the first women doctors  she also survived unprecedented media attention  her first courtroom appearance was followed by a bevy of reporters concerned above all with her appearance her voice inflection and her facial tone  now those of you who've appeared in court for your first time already will know what it's like to walk into a courtroom   can you imagine walking into that courtroom as the first woman  with a hoard of newspaper reporters at your toes  this is one of the reports that was written  quotation   clara brett martin went on to develop a successful practice centring upon wills real estate and family law  women lawyers howl with laughter when they hear this because that's still where women practice   she rarely went to court  one is not surprised   she hired a number of female articling students  she gave fre frequent lectures to women's organizations on issues of women and law  she wrote extensively for the national council of women of canada criticizing the paternal rights in child custody the double standard of sexuality in law and the legal disabilities of married women  she lobbied for female suffrage and for separate women's courts  she was elected as a school trustee and she ran for the position of alderman in nineteen twenty   she died in nineteen twenty-three at the relatively young age of forty-nine of a heart attack   now within the past year and a half we have had a monumental discovery because until this time all efforts to trace clara brett marin's diaries journals correspondence personal and business files have failed  however within the past year and a half a p h d history student named peter sibenik who was researching files in the archives of the ontario attorney general going through countless letters received by the ontario attorney general in the early twentieth century came across a letter from clara brett martin  now this is one of the only surviving letters remaining from clara brett martin's practice  and this letter indicates that clara brett martin may have been a proponent of sex equality but she was also capable of fairly ugly forms of discrimination  the letter she wrote in nineteen fifteen to the ontario attorney general accused jewish realtors of transferring proper title  property titles improperly   i'm going to quote two or three lines of this  anybody who'd like to look at the full letter i have ah the full contents of it with me which you can see after  but the lines which capture the flavour went as follows  quotation   now this is one letter and one of the first questions that i'd been asked when i'm making this speech is can we make any assessments on the basis of one letter  and i think that's a difficult question to answer  i think that it is safe to say that on the basis of this one letter we can make an assessment that clara brett martin was anti-semitic   on the other hand this past week i received a correspondence from gladys kroech from the university of toronto which suggests that it is difficult to be conclusive in the face of one letter  and i'd like to read to you from a letter which she sent me written to her by robert gordon and dated november twenty-eighth nineteen ninety   it writes he writes i have been reading with some interest recent reports of clara brett martin and certain anti-semitic remarks which she reportedly made   quote continues   now we got first late-breaking news about a jewish legal secretary and bookkeeper   now i think that alters our record somewhat but not completely  i don't think memories positive memories from a jewish secretary and bookkeeper are going to completely override a clearly expressed form of anti-semitism in a nineteen fifteen letter but i think it signals  very importantly to us that matters of discimination are complicated and that people are not all one or the other  none of us is free from discrimination and none of us is completely malevolent and i think that sets the context for my remarks today   canadian society and the legal profession was riddled with anti-semitism throughout the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century  in the first decade of the nineteenth century ezekiel hart a merchant from the small jewish community in trois-rivi&egrave;res was elected twice to represent his riding in the quebec legislative assembly  both times he was declared ineligible to sit because he was a jew  interestingly it was one of his m family  members a descendant of ezekiel hart who became the first jewish lawyer called to the bar in the two canadas reference to upper and lower canada some years later   by the eighteen eighties and nineties pogroms in russia and romania caused several thousand jews to immigrate to canada and incidents of bigotry began to increase  goldwin smith who in the nineteenth century was the darling of the canadian intelligentsia was characterized as an arch jew-bater and bitter anti-semite by the jewish times  writing in eighteen eighty smith proclaimed that jews were an abhorrent tribe anti-social and immoral  henri bourassa the french canadian parliamentarian defended the russian pogroms of nineteen oh five arguing that jews brought it on themselves through deception and exploitation  in nineteen hundred the toronto weekly sun clamoured to prohibit immigration of polish jews  no invasion could be worse it wrote claiming that polish jews were corruptors of the community  in nineteen oh four the ottawa free press protested the immigration of russian jews a group it described as having drained the miserable purses of careless russian peasants through usury and extortion   in the nineteen twenties and thirties vast sectors of the economy were completely closed to jews  banks insurance companies department stores universities and large industrial corporations refused to hire jews  there were no jewish judges and most law firms also refused to hire jewish members  bora laskin could not find a job in nineteen thirty-seven when he returned to toronto from harvard law school  a brilliant legal scholar with two master's degrees to his credit he was consigned to write head notes for a law publisher at fifty cents a note   now the question you're going to be asking yourself is is historical context an excuse  does it excuse clara brett martin's letter to know that she was surrounded by anti-semitic rhetoric and bigotry   is it possible to argue she was merely a product of racist discriminatory intolerant times  now the typical historical answer to this is yes   my answer is no   class discrimination anti-semitism racism ableism heterosexism and other forms of bias have made the lives of many members of oppressed groups an unmitigated hell  clara brett martin must have known that and if she didn't she should have   throughout these years in addition to the bigots there were people battling discrimination  jews and other religious minority groups were demanding freedom of religion and an end to religious racial and ethnic bigotry  there were choices to be made   clara brett martin chose to perpetrate some of the abuses not fight  them   to modernize her choices must be viewed as tragic  a woman of such insight who fought so valiantly against the forces of oppression in many aspects of her life who paid the price of ostracism ridicule and undisguised hostility for her work reveals herself as partially riddled with bias in some other aspects of her beliefs and practices   now to move to a modern perspective the present debate seems to focus on how we today in contemporary times should respond to information revealing tragic deficiencies in insight of the famous heroines of the past  and i think the importance of this question cannot be overemphasized   and i offer my remarks today as the preliminary beginnings of what must necessarily be a full and lengthy debate   i also want to speak briefly about my own status in offering these remarks as a non-jew   to some degree my situation today reflecting on clara brett martin's anti-semitism reminds me of a situation of a man who comes to address an audience on how to tackle difficult issues relating to the oppression of women  we've had a lot of debate in canada over the last number of months  on the concept of appropriation of voice and who should speak on these issues  and i must say i side squarely with the group that is worried about appropriation of voice in that scholars researchers advocates who do not speak from personal experience make mistakes and i believe that  jewish women in fact should take the lead in this debate as individuals who have much deeper insight into anti-semitism and its meaning than anything that gentiles can offer  however many jewish people have suggested to me that it is not enough for us to sit back and let them take the lead on these debates that indeed they want to hear our voices in this matter  and so i'm going to speak thinking i have some impo  important points to offer and knowing that i'm taking the risk of missing essential elements in the argument and hoping that if i do jewish feminists will respond and we will all learn more   and i want to talk squarely about the concept of a heroine today  because i think the question we're grappling is what meaning significance and symbolism should we accord to women of the past   and it's very well captured to my mind in the label  heroine   are these women heroines or not   and this question is going to expand well beyond clara brett martin as more historical evidence comes to the fore about nellie mcclung's activity siding with the uh committee of citizens the one thousand citizens that attempted to strike break during the winnipeg general strike  reference to the citizens' committee of 1000 as more evidence of emily stowe the first white woman doctor's class insensitivities come to the fore  ya i mean even uh one of the most famous women from quebec history  i'm gonna going to forget her name  marguerite bourgeoys uh turns out to have been an active slave holder and uh marketer in slaves   i think that as our society struggles towards a greater sensitivity to class and race and gender disparities we're going to learn more about the mistakes of women we have cast as heroines   the search for heroines embodies an individualized history   for many of us history comes alive through people through the faces of individuals who have striven for change who've suffered who've triumphed and sometimes even failed abjectly in their efforts to improve the society around them   dictionary definitions of heroine however are highly problematic  i began with my oxford dictionary   the oxford dictionary cites heroine and refers you to heroic   heroic refers you to hero   and hero is a largely male-centred concept 
Canada	 the oxford dictionary speaks of illustrious warriors of men admired for their achievements and noble qualities   searching for a female-centred definition i turned to vogue magazine  crowd laugher   i always tell my students i read vogue for the articles  crowd laugher   in any event vogue magazine described heroines as infinitely alluring a shade tragic crowd laugher   damsels in distress locked in castle turrets loom immediately before your eyes  i was rescued somewhat by the publication of feminist dictionaries over the last several years and the several that i cited poke fun at  hero   my favourite was a recitation from charlotte perkins gilman who was a very famous american feminist at the turn of the century who wrote as follows  this is her definition of hero   quotation   and i realized why we elected brian mulroney canadian prime minister crowd laugher   now cough what's most interesting to me about the feminist dictionary is that it contained no entry for heroine    presumably some feminists have concluded that the female counterpart of this hero is unsalvageable that it is seriously infected with saccharine femininity race and class privilege and the glorification of characteristics prized by men  with this perspective i sympathize but i respect   respectfully wish to disagree  i have always been partial to the reclamation of words and i think there is room to rehabilitate the word heroine  altered to give new meaning and dimension to the concept  it is not beyond the realm of possibility to believe that the feminist movement could forge an entirely new definition for  heroine one much richer fuller and more reflective of the diversity of women's lives  i think we need to grope toward something which will capture the lives of women who represent strength courage persistence  fortitude all of those in the face of oppression  and i think there're two main premises behind the reclamation task  let me just write this  i know you need a focal point at this point   the first direction we have to move sound of writing on a blackboard is the concept of inclusivity  our understanding of the levels of oppression have to be as inclusive as possible so that we ensure that race class and sexual orientation and so on are considered as well as gender  secondly sound of writing on a blackboard   secondly i think we have to grapple with the male traditions which tout heroes as role models and as perfect  i think we have to move beyond perfection   and i think we need to ask ourselves is perfection what feminists want to demand of their foresisters  is perfection a necessary ingredient of female heroism   let me start with the first inclusivity   much of our current feminist historical scholarship has focused upon white well-educated middle and upper class protestant women  for this i have to claim i share some responsibility  i'm clearly implicated in terms of the women that i began choosing to study  in my defence and the defence of the rest of us i can say that their records tend to be more accessible and their achievements have tended to reflect in some measure the criteria that wider society has viewed as heroic   but it seems to me that the search for women who represent strength and courage and persistence and fortitude in the face of oppression should be much wider   and the realization of this was painfully brought home to me  when i began working on my manuscript which will be appearing this spring titled petticoats and prejudice  i know this is the second time the title's been mentioned  i'm shamelessly flaunting my book   this is based on about a decade's worth of research i've done on nineteenth century legal records  and they reveal a remarkably diverse bunch of women improperly married wives victims of seduction and rape perpetrators of infanticide and abortion practising prostitutes petitioners for divorce and child custody and wage labourers  none of these women are warriors active in military manoeuvres  furthermore the admiration they achieved from a paternalistic society was grudgingly qualified at best   nor were they fainting damsels rescued by handsome knights   and yet there's undeniable heroism in the lives of women such as the following  ellen rogers was a francophone rape victim who demanded that women of all classes and sexual background should be protected from sexual assault  she spoke those words through tears in a toronto courtroom in eighteen fifty-nine to a courtroom filled with jeering and abusive public members who were laughing and shouting as her gang rapists were acquitted  esther r scott was an english prostitute who ran a notorious brothel in london ontario in the eighteen eighties  the crown attorney and the mayor of london decided to conduct a legal vendetta against her to make an example of her  she hired  she was a well-to-do brothel operator  she hired the leading criminal lawyers in the country a raft of them  about four by the time she finished  and she fought them at every turn of the way  and when she achieved success in her criminal case she turned around and authorized her lawyers to sue the crown attorney and mayor of london for compensation for false imprisonment  she won at the first level of hearings  subsequently the ruling was overturned but before they could catch up with her to jail her she had fled to the united states  and she returned to london approximately a decade later flush with prosperity with a new husband in tow who was described as a horse breeder and horse dealer to live out her life in financial security and middle class respectability in london ontario   euphemia rabbit was a woman from the first nations who also had italian ancestry who shot and killed her would-be rapist at slate creek british columbia in eighteen ninety-seven and she successfully argued self-defence at her murder trial   anna ballo a finnish immigrant committed infanticide in nanaimo in eighteen ninety-six in the face of stark poverty and social ostracism and then withstood the dramatic legal intervention into her life with stoicism and fortitude   nellie armstrong was a feisty smart-mouthed hot-tempered new brunswicker who fought unsuccessfully in eighteen ninety-five to wrest custody of her four year old daughter and two year old son from a violent husband  these women and others are ones whose histories should also be reclaimed and who also deserve the accolation heroine   next moving to perfection beyond perfection  male heroes male heroes have traditionally been catapulted into service for furnishing role models for the current generation and women have borrowed this pattern and heroines have been forced into moulds as gurus touted as unblemished symbols of wisdom insight and inspiration  my colleague rob martin has charged me with inculcating adulation of clara brett martin publicly  i think fairly in some measure  fairly   and i think the time is overdue for us to re-examine the search for perfection and consider whether it is essential or fundamental to our emerging new concept of heroine  these women did not ask to become our shining knights in armour   most of them would be horrified to know to what degree their thoughts and deeds would be scrutinized by future generations  out of a feminist sense of charity perhaps we ought not to require women of the past to bear responsibility of icons of the future a role they never sought   femininism might want to work towards embodying a more humble sense of human error a more grounded set of expectations about human failings and deficiencies  we come by this naturally  no one who has worked within the feminist movement for any length of time can claim innocence on this score   one of the gravest tasks facing our society today is to work towards an elimination of continuing and vicious anti-semitism racism ableism and other forms of discrimination   one of the chief barriers is the inability of members of the privileged groups in our society to admit their complicity  the knee-jerk reactions of defensiveness which sprouts almost immediately upon any assertion of sexism and racism is eloquent testimony to our wish to erase even the most polite dialogue on these issues   one way we might speed the work against these barriers is to look to our past to dissect the racism sexism and other forms of discrimination of our ancestors to do this honestly and without attempting to distance ourselves artificially from their errors   clara brett martin's failure to make feminism inclusive of all women's interests is centrally important to any full analysis of her place in history  i think we can learn from her errors because in so many ways her errors are our errors and this whole debate is about ourselves and the future  we can use the revelations about clara brett martin's anti-semitism as a spur to produce more research on the history of anti-semitism and its current manifestations on our profession and society  we can make clara brett martin's mistakes work to our heightened appreciation of justice fairness and equality  we can turn her lack of insight into a mechanism for remedial action today  clara brett martin's principles and actions were marred by bigotry and limited perspective but she did fight against some forms of male injustice  she challenged a part of the patriarchal system and she paid personally for her daring  demanding that she be perfect that she have understood every aspect of bigotry and injustice is to hold her to a model which will be met by very few perhaps none   that vision of heroine as perfect and omniscient is binding restrictive and remarkably rigid  if we hold to it we will consign ourselves to a future in which historians will write of theory and institutions but not of people  i for one would rather historians continue to write about individual women detailing at length their shortcomings and yet according them the respect of recognizing that at points there were bonds of shared sisterhood  clara brett martin is revealed as a women as a woman with significant gaps in her understanding of injustice and discrimination  i think we need to ask ourselves whether there is still room for her within this evolving rehabilitated concept of heroine  and i want to close with a poem by adrienne rich called a wild patience has taken me this far  quotation   thank you applause   a friend of mine returned from the two words  describing this bizarre geography book called gender and sexuality  after tracking down and reading peter jackson's maps of meaning i realized that it is an unusual book because it stretches the traditional boundaries of the discipline of geography word inclusion of issues of class race and gender   i mean what can possibly be geograph  geographical about such intimate personal subjects as gender and sexuality   as a feminist and as a new geography p h d student i was immediately intrigued by the potential of the common terrain between feminism and geography but when i tried to investigate word  field it proved to be problematic   whether discussed in mainstream geography journals or in traditional geographic circles i soon discovered that feminist geography is marginalized and obscure little known by geographers and even less known by feminists  in this paper i will briefly review the study of women in geography and gender and i will explore some reasons behind the neglect of this important body of work by mainstream geography   this question of geography's word  feminists is important because as marianne withers argues  when word the explicit study of the geography of women geographers have implicitly accepted the existing structure of society and prevented the examination of one of the most persistent and  pervas pervasive forms of inequality in our society    women were word from geography up until very recent times  it was only in the mid-nineteen seventies in britain and in the united states that a small group of not surprisingly female geographers became concerned with the neglect of women in the discipline   they set themselves the monstrous task of retrieving   retrieving the word from obscurity as they believed that the study of women's lives and spatial behaviour was of equal importance to the study of men's and that the distinctiveness  two or three words of women's experiences should be recognized  this original research which focused exclusively on how women adapted to their spatial activities became known as the geography of women   it directly challenged traditional geo  geographical work which one focused solely on males despite the  use of gender neut neutral   word two treated both males and females as one homogenous category or three implicitly assumed that men's lives were the norms a standard a standard against which women's lives can be compared 
Canada	 it has been argued that this development of feminist geography parallels developments in other humanist geographic research such as marxist  and phenomenological studies   as two words although the content of the questions asked differs in these disciplines researchers who  asked about social word about class relations and about social meaning in human action experience a similar process of emerging dissatisfaction with the capacity of a given disciplinary framework's comfort handling their questions and the changes which inspired them  the debates among human geographers questioned the definition of geography as a so solely spatial science and reintroduced human environmental relations as essential concerns of the discipline   word feminist geographers in the united states in canada and in great britain concur that feminism did come later to geography than to other social sciences and that its influence has been both remarkably negligible and word   but few of these theorists questioned why it was that the theoretical and empirical achievements of feminism have been almost completely ignored in geography  i suggest that feminism has not succeeded in significantly influencing traditional geographic thought because of the singularly androcentric that is male-dominated or male-centred nature of the discipline  now male dominance is neither specific to geography nor to other  word   it pervades all society and as such it is reflected in our institutions  but perhaps male dominance is especially prevalent in geography   jenna martin and susan manson briefly considered the reasons for the me meagre  word feminism in geography and they conclude that the answer lies in the word number of women in the discipline historically  they say the number of women involved in generating knowledge in a given discipline appears to be important in determining the degree to which feminism is absorbed in a specific academic research institution   as all knowledge is a social creation it reflects the conditions out of which it is produced and transmitted   geographic knowledge and theory a few words  with men's knowledge and theory and word men who have defined its focuses and interests have defined the fields the areas and the acceptable lines of study and research  it is true that historically the discipline of geography in britain in the united states and in canada is a male-dominated profession  although word students are equally represented at undergraduate levels men are predominant maybe three words  especially on the physical side of the discipline  and of the few female students who do enter the graduate levels the attrition level is high  one study from the united states shows that feminist or female graduate geography students not necessarily feminists have word  the highest uh attrition rate of all the social sciences  in fact some recent statistics published in nineteen eighty-nine in ontario show that geography is the most male-dominated social science  there are fewer women at the masters p h d and word  levels in geography than in any other social science including what i would consider traditionally male bastions of economics law and political science  to give an example closer to home i'm the only female of the seven first-year p h d stud p h d students in geography here at dean's   but the male-dominated nature of the discipline as suggested by  susan manson is not a sufficient explanation of the meagre  im impact of feminism in geography  we need to take one step backward and ask why there are so few  females in geography   i argue that it is is related to the nature of the discipline of geography which is inherently androcentric  and in sharp conflict with the nature of feminism  in fact nearly all of the human geography maybe two words has been a study of the word world  geography like any other discipline is a product of its times  the origins of western geography penetrates back to the ancient greeks in the fifth and fourth century b c where the first  philosophers the ionians including a few words and so on first began to ask questions with the shape and origin of the earth  it's interesting that the first philosophy which emerged from the west was the philosophy of nature   their aim was to create a man-made philosophy which could explain and control the whims and irrationality of nature word    women were excluded from the ranks of these philosophers and  phrase   although geography is currently divided into the human geography and physical geography the emergence of geography initially from a physical science that is geography or geology uh the study of the earth's surface is significant   this may partially explain why geography has traditionally been more male-dominated than other social sciences as hard physical sciences have historically been seen as a male endeavour and it may partially explain why it traditionally stresses the landscape a landscape which is formed and interpreted by the male gaze   a few words described this role of the male gaze in shaping the landscape  she interpreted the european occupation of the word  in the united states personified in the female body in overtly sexual terms   the association that was prevalent in ancient greece of women with the private sphere and men with the public has continued in western minds    as geographers throughout history have traditionally been men it is understandable how geography has pro has focused predominantly on public that is male spaces  hence it is not surprising that in those places on the earth where we could see the greatest interaction between man and his environment such as the ancient greek adore agora  or in contemporary urban areas it is evident that in these places they have been constructed by and for men   as women have been associated with private spaces they have relatively little opportunity to modify the landscape traditionally studied by geographers  as linda mcdowell notes geographers unlike sociologists usually exclude the small scale and the word for consideration ignoring the material world the social and spatial relationships that take place within buildings   quote continues   mcdowell is an an example of urban geography which is which has traditionally considered the production of the built environment the distribution of the urban space how households gain access to certain types of housing in particular parts of towns and cities but they stop at the front door and they ignore questions about the sexual division of labour within the home or the structural word relations within the households  thus geography's emphasis on large scale and macro processes provides another reason for the degree to which geography has remained remarkably untouched by feminist theory   as lloyd suggests geo geographers   might consider the word uh of interiors as expressions of a culture reflecting women's activities but it is important to realize that this women's culture is word  in a predominantly male architecture and design  in this paper i've attempted to understand the reasons behind geography's reluctance to adopt feminist insights as this will provide a stronger vantage point from which to ta tackle   its historically androcentric nature   this nature of geography explains why feminism was word  to geography and why feminist geography and insights in  of feminist theory in general are so little known by geographers  feminist geography provides a direct challenge to this androcentricity  it's to admit the gender bias of traditional geographic theory and to transform radically the structure of our knowledge of reality and our obsession of states of things   this discussion also contributes to the current debate of whether feminist theory and researching should be added as one thread among many within human geography or whether a feminist perspective might be developed within all the subdivisions of human geography   i see geo feminist geography  now as fitting into helene cixous's framework of binary oppositions where feminist geography is in an unprivileged position to traditional that is non-feminist geography   cixous who posits &eacute;criture f&eacute;minine  as a solution to male discourse would have undoubtedly argued that feminist geography should remain as a separate endeavour   linda peet argues that feminist geography as a separate specialist course on feminist geography would combat continuing sexism and encourage female students to sit in the academic environment   this would word to initiate a practical challenge to the male-dominated a few words of academia since as morgan hanson hanson  has argued the more women are involved in the dissemination of knowledge the greater degree to which feminism is likely to be appropriated  word research processes   but an integrationist approach would also combat sexism and it would also encourage more women to go into geography  i argue that the inherently androcentric nature of geography indicates that it is vital for geography to wholeheartedly adopt feminist   insig insights within all of human geography  if feminist geography remains as a separate and marginalized subdiscipline it will present a weaker challenge to the highly androcentric nature of geography  thus i advocate a feminist perspective within all streams of human geography as feminism has the potential to radically transform the entire discipline of geography as well as all of its attending theories methodologies and word applause  question and answer period   so our immediate interpretation relu   directly related to word by the text which engages them or are they not   have polled the five readers polled informed readers polled model readers and alike acquire an expertise that distinguishes them from the ordinary reader  are literary critics experts   if so what is the nature of their expertise   are certain strategies and codes more important than others or used more often by expert readers   if so under what circumstances   do experts and non-experts develop interpretive strategies as stanley fish claims or are they merely activating textual levels or applying codes as umberto eco would have us believe   within literary theory circles eminent theories   theorists differ widely as to the response to these questions  who is one to believe   the keyword here is perhaps believe for although theories about the role of the reader and the subjectivity of the reading process abound to date there have been few controlled studies within reader response circles which actually test reception theories  in fact few reader response scholars have provided the community with any significant empirical data to date to back up their various hypotheses or to justify the conclusions they draw of what readers respond to literature   reader response to a few great books the empirical  study book a collection of original essays i've edited for burton de gravel in the series approaches to literature aims to fill this void by reporting on recent empirical studies of reader response to literary texts  its contributors scholars from around the world reveal in this book the degree to which expert and non-expert readers use literary devices and reading strategies to make their judgements and propose interpretations  by supplying us with some sought after hard facts these scholars advance our understanding of the nature role and importance of textual levels and codes interpretive strategies and socio-historical determinacy  they do so by applying theories and techniques from many disciplines to concrete examples and reproducible experiments  the results of their empirical studies suggest that text counts that interpretive strategy counts and that culture counts  on several levels and to varying degrees their research indicates that what we read how we read and who we are all determine meaning  their empirical studies of the way ordinary readers read may also help us understand how expert readers read   for instance and this i refer to part one of the   the book if you detect this construct for instance   if it can if it can be shown as do joanne hatter  billy van deer jamie mill ted gagvillavallaboom  and jeff sanderson with greg mcguinty if it can be shown then that in many cases the apparently intuitive judgement of readers are actually based on real and measurable criteria one can then suppose that literary critics also base their interpretations of text on definable and reproducible textual clues and markers  in the same way and this i refer to the second half reduction of meaning if as shown by jane mchaley jorge veranda   lazlo gallas and raymond du maurier in this book  in this book cultural awareness and reading expertise influence the way the readers of so-called informed readers vary in certain circumstances from those of non-informed readers then these same traits should predispose culturally aware literary critics to perform as expert readers  of course i'm being a bit facetious here because you know we're  laugh all supposed to be experts but we'll play the game  to perform as expert readers when tested against so-called na&iuml;ve readers  the empirical findings of this research all this which we can't talk about today but has brought me to this point can then lead one to formulate a variety of hypo of hypotheses  regarding the way literary critics read and this indeed has been elaborated as well on this first par  part page   hypothesis one literary critics have expertise that distinguishes them from other readers 
Canada	 hypothesis two the expertise of literary critics should enable them to pick up more textual clues and markers than non-experts do  hypothesis three critics versed in the cultural references of a particular text should respond differently to that text than those who are not as culturally informed  hypothesis four within the same critical circle there should be commonly held concepts and ways of reading a text  over the past few years i've aimed to establish the validity of these hypothesis hypotheses though my own  through my own empirical research  to accomplish this i've conducted a series of studies in which i had graduate students some of whom could be considered as expert readers analyze the same text using the same critical model of analysis  my objective was to see under these circumstances to what extent interpretations or readings would vary within and between groups  the independent variables tested were levels of expertise critical expertise including knowledge of the genre the critical model used and the corresponding linguistic and literary theories and knowledge of the culture in this case canadian and or quebecois culture  along with what i refer to all of these do  levels of domain knowledge i also sought to determine if the time factor was a sig was significant when analyzing the text  the sample text for all readers twenty-five in all was a play written about pre-war quebec by the quebecois writer playwright marie laberge  c'&eacute;tait avant le guerre &agrave; l'anse-&agrave;-gilles  the critic model was based upon greimas' system of functional analysis and pavis' commitaire  quantitative study of word or stage elements found in printed plays  my subjects were graduate students in canada and france with varying self-rated degrees of knowledge about dramatic analysis and the semiotics about the precise critical methodology used about canada and quebec and about quebec theatre   method  using an analytical grid the analytical grid adapted from the work of greimas an analytical grid adapted from the work of greimas and paris subjects were asked to analyze one scene one scene of the laberge play  they did this by dividing this scene into subscenes based on what they perceived of the different conflicts depicted in the text  they were asked to designate the subject the object and the opponent of these conflicts' spheres of action maybe three words and to describe the overall general atmosphere of the scene connotations later regrouped under convergences convergences created by the different theatrical or stage elements referred to in the text  the first of the three independent variables measured the results of spontaneous versus non-spontaneous reading  the remaining independent variables related to the scores obtained by the readers in relation to six different domains of knowledge  knowledge of canada knowledge of quebec knowledge of theatre knowledge of quebec theatre knowledge of linguistics or semiotics and knowledge of the critical model  i first compared results against the total scores obtained for the six domains of expertise  that is i used the overall expertise of the readers to compare the analysis of those obtaining high total knowledge scores against those with low total knowledge scores  i did this in order to see whether or not the more informed readers would answer differently than less informed ones   then i compared the readers' analysis in relation to each of the six domains of expertise  in this case i wanted to find out a if culture and knowledge cultural knowledge made a difference when reading a test a text that was culturally specific b if critical expertise whether it be dramatic criticism or semiotics lead high scoring readers to answer differently from low scoring ones and c if the choice and or knowledge of the methodology made a difference  i also ran a test to determine whether spontaneous reading by a group of subjects would be the same as that conducted by the same readers who had had time to read and think about the text  here are the results   spontaneous versus non-spontaneous  when i compared the analysis of those who noted down their interpretations as they were reading the text with those produced by students having had time to study the text i noted areas of agreement within and between both groups  spontaneous reactions to a text can be held in common and can be maintained over time  nevertheless there were some con  inconsistencies two words with spontaneous reading  over time a few readers also changed their minds as to the meaning of a text   in the case of the two independent of the two dependent variables subjects opponents time led to more coherent readings of the text  when designating objects and convergences those who had more time that is the non-spontaneous readers entered more responses than did the spontaneous group  for example the non-spontaneous group supplied more objects and more convergences than did the spontaneous group  conclusion   and of course this is all very summarized form  time makes a difference  not surprising  it leads readers to change their minds about the meanings of a text to produce more consistent analysis of what they have read and to propose more varied and more nuanced analysis  i'm going to go to what you have as uhm four point three  instead of four point two for the first and i'll go back to four point two  critical expertise overall knowledge   when comparisons against the overall knowledge levels of the reading subjects were conducted a complex pattern was revealed of overlap and agreement coupled with opposing nuances and outright contradictions  on the one hand informed readers agree on several points with non-informed readers  that is there were some commonly held perceptions  on the other hand those who were most informed selected a larger number of types of objects and convergences than did the less informed group where choices were more spread out and basically less consistent within the group  conclusion  informed readers and non-informed readers disagree as to the relative importance of the different types of possible answers  the concepts of those with high levels of overall knowledge are more differentiated their readings more nuanced than those of the less informed readers  to put it another way the more you know the more you have to say  this is certainly a reassuring conclusion for those of us who make a living from having a lot to say and saying it in such a way as to imply   that we're that we are revealing new truths to those who may be listening  but more significantly it points to the importance of overall domain-related knowledge and the differentiation of expert and non-expert readers  now we'll go to specifics  critical expertise knowledge of the critical model   when i compared the work of readers who were not instructed as to the use of the actual critical model with that of well-instructed readers results showed that there was generally no consistent pattern of response within the non- insis instructed group  moreover by none of my measures did the non-instructed group agree with the instructed group  for example readers with high levels of this type of domain knowledge designated subjects and opponents more often and more logically than did those with little knowledge of the model  in the same way subjects with high levels of domain knowledge also designated more objects and more convergences than did than did those with low levels of knowledge of the critical model   conclusion  knowledge of the process seems to make a difference both as a distinguishing factor between experts and non-experts and as a means of differentiating experts from each other  knowledge of the critical methodology distinguishes readers from each other  it is also sufficient condition to allow readers to produce more levels of meaning  in this case more convergences than objects   critical expertise knowledge of theatre and or dramatic criticism  the comparison of those with high levels of knowledge and or dramatic criticism and those with low levels of this type of critical expertise produce interesting results which correlate with the finding for measures of overall knowledge  informed readers agreed in some points identified by non-informed readers  informed readers generally analyze texts differently than do non-informed readers  answers in the low level group differed by as much as fifty percent by those of the high level group  informed readers isolate more elements of meaning than do non-informed readers and perhaps consequently informed readers disagree more between themselves than do non-informed readers   conclusion  knowledge of the genre makes a difference  it differentiates informed and non-informed readers and informed readers against themselves  there can be some agreement between the two groups but overall those with relevant domain knowledge performed differently than those without this type of knowledge  domain specific critical expertise is what differentiates expert readers from non-expert readers and from each other  at least one might think that until we get to a knowledge of semiotics another kind of expertise  perhaps the most surprising result of my research was that produced by the comparison between those possessing semiotic knowledge with those with low levels of this particular type of critical expertise  one could have expected these readers to behave as expert readers that is to reply differently than the non-expert group and to provide more layers of meaning  but this is not what i found  responses were essentially the same for both groups  the high knowledge group  i don't know if i should audience laughter leave now   the high knowledge group designated about as many objects as did the low knowledge group and both groups selected ah almost the same number of convergences  conclusion   being high highly informed about literature or literary theory in general is not a significant factor when analyzing a specific genre or using a specific methodology  knowing about literary theory does not allow readers to produce more detailed analysis or different readings than those of non-informed readers  expert knowledge of theatre and dramatic criticism is what is required to differentiate literary critics of drama from non-expert readers  knowledge about semiotics apparently only generally relates to the specific application of the greimasian model to theatre and is therefore not enough to differentiate these critics from non-experts   cultural expertise knowledge of canada or quebec   although canadians and quebecois experts offered more levels of meaning than a non-informed groups group those with high levels of knowledge about canada or quebec did not differ amongst themselves as to the meaning of the different types of analysis  moreover whether they knew about canada or about quebec these readers distinguished themselves from those who knew less about canada or quebec by proposing far more objects and far more convergences  conclusion   cultural expertise leads readers to form more numerous and more consistent opinions on the meaning of a text related to the culture about which they are knowledgeable   might tell us something about uhm national or regional interpretations of national or regional literatures    readers with knowledge of the culture to which the text is related produce more meanings than less informed readers do but more consistent and fewer than the other texts maybe three words   critical and cultural expertise knowledge of quebec theatre  quebec theatre as opposed to theatres just by itself  knowledge of quebec theatre turned out to be a maybe two words produced complex and surprising results  there was some agreement between the two groups although the informed group produced more answers than did the non-informed group  however when compared with those knowledgeable about canada or quebec this high knowledge group that is readers with high   know know knowledge levels   of cultural and critical expertise designated fewer objects and convergences than did the culturally aware group  this implies yet again that there is a fine line to be drawn between different types and levels of expertise and there might even be a type of expertise such as the case here which read lead   readers to draw more concise and succinct conclusions than will not more na&iuml;ve readers do  conclusion  as with the high cultural knowledge group readers with high levels of knowledge about the culture and the genre did not differ much within their own group although their responses differed in number and kind from the low level group 
Canada	 high levels of either dramatic critical knowledge or overall domain knowledge differentiate readers from those with little or no relevant  domain knowledge  if you know about the relevant culture and if you are an expert in the particular genre the text relates to then your reading of the text will be different from those without your double level of expertise  on the other hand however cultural and critical expertise together does not necessarily lead to more numerous explanations than emanate from readers with high levels of other types of domain knowledge  overall results   taken as a whole  i guess it's what's called conclusion  about three words   taken as a whole all of these comparisons indicate that experts read differently than non-experts do  hypothesis number one  they also show that experts read more into a text than do non-experts  hypothesis number two  and that knowledge of the relevant culture differentiates readers  hypothesis three  hypothesis four  commonly held ways of reading among experts has not been neatly proven however  word my study produced the finding that expert readings must have specific domain knowledge in order to distinguish themselves as a group from non-experts  belonging to the same group of experts on theory is not enough to differentiate one group of readers from another  so if you take all the semioticians in the room you will not answer as a whole   sorry folks  okay  discussion  these conclusions are consistent with other studies reported on in my book and with experiments conducted by co  cognitive scientists on non-literary texts   to illustrate the latter point let me cite the example of the work of dane bosch   this experimental cognitivist use accounts used accounts of a fictitious baseball game to study the difference between what baseball experts learn and retain when reading and what   non-expert baseball non baseball experts learned and retained from the same text  bosch found that high knowledge subjects reported larger chunks of information and recalled more propositions than did low knowledge subjects  high knowledge subjects also described textual events in more   graphi graphically and with more variety than did the low knowledge group  the conclusions bosch drew from his full-scale study full-scale study about knowledge levels and reading recall of a non-literary text could very well be applied to what i have found when studying the reception of a literary text  according to both these studies domain-related concepts of the high knowledge individual are more differentiated than the concepts of the  no lo low knowledge individual  furthermore high knowledge individuals have a much greater knowledge of contingent relations and are more adept at using this knowledge than are those with low domain knowledge  in general then those who read either non-literary or literary texts reveal similar patterns of reading and understanding  there are commonly held concepts and ways of reading within and between different groups of readers  there is a difference between the perceptions of nine na&iuml;ve readers and those of literary readers literary experts   literary critics as do other informed readers read differently than do non-informed readers  my empirical research into reader response has provided some useful insights into the role of interpretive strategies the significance of critical knowledge domain specific critical expertise and the role of culture in the reading process  it also points to answers some of the questions i first posed in nineteen eighty-nine in an article that appeared in linguika called  the reader as expert   and if you look at the book summary you'll see that i have the last chapter is called the reader as expert part two   and the book is really a response to that whole  that article that appeared in nineteen eighty-nine  literary critics do have expertise that distinguishes them from non-critics  literary critics tend to respond consistently as a group and therefore have expertise that is not idiosyncratic  literary critics pick up the same text markers that other readers do but they do so more frequently and more consistently than do na&iuml;ve readers  but colleagues beware  these results should be considered tentative and incomplete  my samples were relatively small and there are many interesting calculations and cross-calculations which could only have been  deter determined from a very large  large scale study  studies of the kind i conducted might very well need to be completely redesigned should new critical models and different testing methods emerge  with time and further research we will also learn to pose other questions  to what degree for example do informed readers propose answers which are probably accurate or likely to be believed as opposed to those spontaneously arrived at  do critics behave more often as problem solvers than as expert readers   does a change of context in a text make a difference to the use of reading strategies  so many questions  so few answers  in the context of reader response to literature and the performance of critics as experts the eye of the beholder holds and contemplates many mysteries yet to be solved  thanks applause   the geography of women is really just a first step though a necessary one because the real problem about incorporating women into geography lies not with word empirical research but at the theoretical and analytical level   the copious quantities of new descriptive and empirical material on women had been collected using traditional geographic word  assumptions methodologies and paradigms  in the early nineteen eighties it became apparent that in order to analyze this new content women a new analytical framework feminism was needed  feminist geography is therefore faced with the much larger task of reworking and redefining geographic theory   so what is feminist geography   just as there isn't one definition of feminism  or even geography there is also no one definition of the intersection of these two things   i define feminist geography as a study which explores dynamic interrelations between space and gender   on the one hand the social construction of gender effects the  ways and extents to which women and men influence and create  their lives   on the other hand space structures and creates  existing word forms of gender relations   as julianne rowes and lars allen point out geographers have long word that landscapes are cultural constructs but they've never considered the ways in which gender is involved in this process   the geography of women is a necessary precursor for the entrance of feminist geography into human geography but it wasn't a sufficient one  feminist geography also emerged at a certain point in the history of geography when similar developments were taking place   uh this paper has had a interesting pre-life already  uh it was written up in the local newspaper the haige  standard as an example of the wacky things the arcane esoteric subject matter  that that academics get up to and in a long list of titles culled from the various learned sessions that started with   loam roman latrines and worked through i don't know sewage systems or something mine was the ultimate wacky topic at the very end and it's a and professor lincolnshire reef is working on gender panic and aesthetically enhanced subjects in cyberpunk  i guess the uh the only really good benefit to come out of it was that uh i was elevated to full professor which is quite a jump from audience laughter from   graduate student so   at least  maybe the english department hasn't found out yet though  i'm expecting the cheque so  uhm there's an irony to that as well to this idea that uh the paper for all that it has this kind of esoteric uh topic matter or title uhm is actually dealing with a form and a subgenre that is very popular  uhm the novel i'll be speaking of principally today neuromancer by william gibson at last look had gone through about fifteen editions has spawned an entire subgenre of material  there are cyberpunk films that are watched by the populous at large  i guess robocop might be one of the best known ones or   or blade runner  uh there's musical attached to it  there's almost a lifestyle that's become attached to it  uhm and so we're talking about something that that  is extremely populist uh a and  not particularly esoteric  at least perhaps not as esoteric as roman latrines   so from beginning from that irony let me begin  we are approaching the asyntotic limit of gender   not the collapse of sexual difference but the ever-receding point at which differences verge on but new do not become self-identical   in the information age the body and the irregular formations of gender which accrete about it are effaced become bits of data with no greater epistemological charge than any other bit of data circulating through our modems and microprocessors  homo datum retains only the irreducible trace of gender  people hooked into the network of databases electronic uhm bulletin boards and mailboxes exist as identities free of reference to their bodies  computer hackers indulge in the opportunity to leave behind the meat of their physical form and sing the body electric  in the net no one can tell if you're black or white male or female young or old oppositions which have a declining relevance once freed of the imperium of the gaze   well the technology of gene splicing and virtual reality software tend towards its eclipse much recent feminist critical theory has been concerned with the role of gender in the construction of gender and identity  teresa de laurentis for example reconfigures foucault's analysis of the technology of sexuality to include the problem of sexual difference  concluding that gender is quote the product and the process of a number of social technologies of technosocial or biomedical apparati   donna haraway's well-known essay a manifesto for cyborgs however perceives the emancipatory potential of the new technologies  in a self-consciously ironic move geared to disconcert those who would pledge allegiance in however mediated a sense to the goddess of a natural femininity  haraway embraces the figure of the cyborg the assemblage of the  o organic and the inorganic of human consciousness and machine agency which blurs the notion of a unitary autonomous and self-aware subject  the cyborg for haraway is quote illegitimate   it quote skips the step of original unity of identification with nature and thus has no trouble with bisexuality pre-oedipal symbiosis unalienated labour or other seductions to organic wholeness  cyborgs of course are not simply the products of a technosocial or biomedical apparati  they are creations of imagination particularly women's fiction   the monster of mary shelley's frankenstein eighteen eighteen but not strictly speaking a cyborg remains the most resonant myth of technology's illegitimate offspring the creature that is not human yet is not animal or machine   frankenstien is also considered by many to be the first true science fiction story and it is not surprisingly science fiction that has been one of the most effective literary forms for drawing into question and problematizing the oppositions of mind body organism machine developed primitive and man woman   cyberpunk the most recent aesthetic revolution in science fiction is as its hybrid tag indicates particularly concerned with the breakdown between the human and the machine that has been the hallmark of late twentieth century post-industrial capitalism   the term cyberpunk signifies less a set of  shared formal and aesthetic devices or even social and political concerns  so much as it does a range of literary styles and themes which only occasionally overlap  its arrival as a full grown movement was announced by the furore of critical accolades and prizes for william gibson's first novel neuromancer which came out in nineteen eighty-four and then by  bruce ber bruce sterling's manifesto-like preface to a cyberpunk anthology entitled mirrorshades which came out in nineteen eighty-eight  in this preface sterling notes two recurrent sources of fascination in cyberpunk  and this will give you some sense of the kind of topic matter that the subgenre deals with  sterling writes the theme of body invasion prosthetic limbs implanted circuitry cosmetic surgery genetic alteration   quote continues   the radical redefinition of the self this is the project which  cyber punk shares with postmodernism and feminism and the form's acute awareness being wrought by advanced computer technology allows it to investigate the problems of self in startling new ways  not surprisingly then the connection there has been a connection drawn between the post or anti-humanist projects of cyberpunk postmodernism and feminism and elicited a critical linkage between the three  in her recent article cybernetic deconstructions cyberpunk and postmodernism veronica hollinger puts cyberpunk in the context of the feminist science fiction of the mid seventies and early eighties the  anti-humanist sensibility she calls it evident in the works of ursula le guin joanna russ and jody scott 
Canada	 case's onocendi console that's a brand name and the novel is littered with brand names is a kind of prosthetic extension of his mind which allows him to transcend his body and interface with a higher reality  as the novel opens case is pursuing a path of self-destruction  caught holding back on a client his nervous system has been sabotaged so that he can no longer enter the matrix that is so dear to him  though it does not effect him otherwise the nerve damage consigns the cowboy to a kind of death in life  he's like the cowboy who can't shoot his gun anymore  he refers to this postmatrix life of his as the fall a corruption which like atoms leaves him in quote the prison of his own flesh at the mercy of quote the meat and all it wants a real disdain for the physical form and  and what it needs to de uh to survive    the computer prosthesis effaces the body relegates it to an archaic and vulnerable support system which requires an unfortunate amount of maintenance  for homo datum biology is no longer the determining factor in destiny but the hardware attached to it  upon case's regaining the ability to enter the matrix the reader is told this was it   quote continues   the prosthetic supplement is not just the means of access to the transcendental realm of cyberspace but the apparatus of its domination   the matrix is the new frontier of the postindustrial psyche a terrain so vast as to never exhaust the imperialist qua  capitalist desire for expansion and exploitation  the relationship between case the console cowboy and the space which is the proving ground of his identity is a remarkably accurate remapping of the politics of domination so evident in the imperialist enterprise  though as hollinger claims neuromancer in many ways aligns the structural oppositions that have supported the phallocentric project of capital the text also encodes a disturbing desire to witness the male subject mastering a threateningly feminine nature which is at once greater and lesser than he   the transition from the world of meat our physical forms to that of cyberspace the word that is used to describe this is  jacking in   one jacks in to the matrix  the act is thus explicitly sexual  the term derives from hardware installation which a male plug or jack is inserted into a female receptacle  it also carries with it particularly in light of the solitary and rhapsodic nature of the act connotations of masturbation  jacking off is a euphemism for  masturbation   the descriptions of case moving through cyberspace consistently display attitudes of male aggression  the console cowboy triggers sequences uses viable programs to bore holes in heights of secure databases and most commonly punches through the colour-coded spheres of information  particularly he punches  spends most of his time punching things i guess from punching a keyboard   the matrix is described as a quote non-space a term resonant with echoes of freud's description of female sexuality as lacuna as a dark continent a non-space of lack and absence  the principle site of male gender panic however is displaced from cyberspace to the prosthetically enhanced woman molly   or rather cyberspace is displaced is a displacement of male anxiety surrounding molly to cyberspace   molly is a razor girl  she's a hired muscle that plies her trade with the aid of uh a mirrored visor grafted into her skull through which she can receive uh information from computer chips implanted in the nervous system  she has these kinds of sunglasses that on the inside of she can receive information  uhm her body has been uhm prosthetically enhanced so that her nervous system is jacked up so that she can respond very quickly to things  more importantly though and more menacing molly's had scalpel blades surgically inserted under her red painted fingernails  a further displacement this time of the teeth of the  vagina dentata the archetypal image of male castration anxiety  the threat molly represents to the male characters is aptly summed up by one who warns another she'd have you wearing your balls for a bowtie if you looked at her cross-eyed   another character peter riviera who is capable of projecting holographic images  he has computer implants which allow him to project three dimensional projections of his imagination   he performs a cabaret piece in which a phantasmal version of himself is shown constructing an idealized molly out of thin air  the performance concludes with the phantom molly extracting her razorblades and ripping her creator apparent  the full significance of riviera's holographic vignette does not become fully apparent until much later in the book when molly perhaps fearing death uncharacteristically reveals something of her past to case  and now it gets very odd  molly was a meat puppet audience laughter a kind of  pros prostitute   this is what molly was  a meat puppet a kind of prostitute who has a computer chip  chip implanted in her nervous system which allows her to dissociate herself from what's going on  essentially the she can throws a switch in her mind and she sort of literally jacks out of her body which then proceeds to go through the actions with whatever her clientele is and then when the act is all over she can come back into her consciousness   molly uses the money earned as a meat puppet to fund the expensive surgery required to outfit her as a razor girl  so she's working as a prostitute to come up with the money  for this uh these new glasses and stuff  however her boss uncovers her subterfuge and has quote   some s some customer software cooked up  he essentially reprograms her body in order to take advantage of her special physical characteristics  her boss figures well she's got these scalpel blades  i've got some pretty klin kinky  clientele that might get off on that  perhaps i can take advantage of this   i never knew who wrote the program they switched me to  says molly but it was based on all the classics   she thus becomes an expression not only of male financial exploitation of women but an entirely male literary tradition of pornography  but the classics that molly refers to can only be the works of de sade and masoch  one night the cut-out chip that shields her conscious mind fails and molly discovers herself in the middle of a routine with a customer  this is not for the squeamish  quote   the implication being that they were it was   a threesome and what the senator wanted was for her to dismember  this the other woman in this in this   m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois   at the end of it when molly jacks back in when her microchip fails and she realizes what she's done she she similarly probably dismembers the senator  quote   molly becomes a complexly overdetermined character of male anxiety  cough more than just the fear concomitant with the figure of the independent autonomous assertive woman she represents the erosion of male power as the return of the repressed  riviera's performance the one where he constructs her out of air and then she destroys him shows her as the product of male power  he literally constructs her  which will ultimately be do the undoing  of that power  she rips him apart  the seeds of its own destruction  molly's days as a meat puppet rewrites the gender panic she inspires as the just and final comeuppance of the exploitation of women in patriarchy  the readily apparent sexual anxiety which surrounds molly spills over into the already feminized realm of cyberspace dangerously destabilizing it as a proving ground of the new male power base  the relationship between the matrix and molly recalls the lack which the prosthetic device serves to disguise   when case first makes love with molly he experiences the act as a substitute for jacking in to the matrix   this is the passage  quote   this scene reverses the comforting male dominance of the act of jacking in  here the female receptacle has literally the upper hand as molly usurps the assertive role  significantly however molly's orgasm goes undescribed  the male dominated point of view seeks to deny to suppress and master the condition of lack lack of power lack of body to which the very fact of prosthesis attests  a body which requires supplementation is always already the site of loss  the narrative voice that is ensconced in case's subjectivity however can only see molly as impaling herself a description fraught with the male desire for mastery in the face of its painfully inferior position  the narrative finally displaces her entirely in the vastness of the space for which she only serves as a metaphor  subsumes her in otherness uh subsumes her otherness into the realm over which he as an ace console jackie has complete control  the effacement of difference sketched in this scene from early in the book reproduces a miniature of the narratological movement of the novel  outfitted with a sim simulation  stim stimulation rig a device implanted in molly's nervous system that allow case to interface with her through his computer  case literally uses her as his eyes so that she moves around through things and he can control her  well he can he can see through her  molly becomes an extension of case a further supplement he requires to bring off the event which is the central concern of the novel the integration of two artificial intelligences in cyberspace  even in this capacity as an extension of case molly fails  oedipus-like her visor is crushed and she is partially blinded by riviera  case himself must both rescue her and complete the job for which they are being paid  the artificial intelligences merge and subsume the otherness of cyberspace into a new figure of transcendental presence  but this universal change results in little more than return of the status quo  so what's the score case asks this being that was once an artificial intelligence  quote   things aren't different it responds  quote   i'm word   we are approaching the asyntotic limit of gender the point at which two lines two vectors of trajectory may approach one another without ever quite meeting for the asymptote is also the point of absolute resistance the horizon of irreducible difference  the figure of the cyborg the prosthetic subject is this limit  it at once announces the inevitable elision of gender in the information age and in return the trace of a new male desire to retain some vestiges of its hegemony to paste over the very conditions which are ushering its inevitable decline  the prosthetic supplement does not only as haraway asserts  scatter subjectivity freeing it from the ties to origin and essence  it also inscribes a terrifyingly feminine condition of lack which is gender panic   gibson's neuromancer as in much cyberpunk literature the cyber the cyborg emerges as the exemp  exemplar less as the exemplar of a non-aligned non-gendered subjectivity so much as the site of male resistance the condition of a new unified subjectivity which transcends the old dualisms of gender only in order to master them again  i would conclude with teresa de laurentis then that quote  if the deconstruction of gender inevitably effects its reconstruction the question is in which terms and in whose interest is the deed  reconstruction being affected   thank you applause question and answer   thanks very much alecia i for   that kind and generous introduction   one of the joys of teaching in this english department has always been the large number of fine writers that there have been here and when you came you added to that number and thank you for that introduction   it's a privilege to give this year's h d halter lectures on language  and i don't know whether this thing consists on making a   do nosedive for my neckline here laugh  perhaps if we move this a little further this way   uhm i don't usually offer to give talks but i wanted to give these because since i've retired from this place it is impossible for me to imagine what my writing life would have been like without that vital influence of h d halter   the details of uhm that influence will probably express themselves  in this in these talks as we go along but  i just wanted to put on the record for myself this fact of a great mind which i encountered here a great teacher and above all a superb reader  because it takes reading to make writing   since these uhm talks are rather personal i hope you won't object to that uhm  if you do you   i mean there's no one standing at the door keeping you here  uh i've cast them in the forms of of  rather long letters written to a writing colleague  and uhm i find it easier that way to to  imagine a listener rather than say a a large number of you whom i know personally but one never knows who shows up and who leaves 
Canada	 and we were still talking there because a c b c canadian broadcasting corporation television crew was filming a documentary about me  my third novel the good places in canaan had just been published  and there in the window space veronica francesca julia ashton  one of the great teachers of my life whom i had certainly never forgotten showed me the official province of saskatchewan department of education daily register for recording the attendance of pupils which she had kept that year when she was seventeen years old when after six weeks of professional training in saskatoon she had come to treadwell on october the nineteenth nineteen forty-two as a certified student teacher with a salary of eight hundred dollars per year prorated of course because she started in at the end of october   and as i grew older i listened to sermons more closely i realized that all this magnificent talk about bible stories  the mennonite church i grew up in had only two art forms  one was great rhetoric and the other was harmonized singing    all of this varied preaching could only mean that there was some debate about what the bible meant and said in some places   and then my mother made a fatal error   to balance all the made up books i was obviously reading in school  she bought a book for me from a traveling salesman i think  now how and with what kind of vehicle this man it could not have been a woman got beyond all the gravel roads in saskatchewan there wasn't a mile of pavement in it at the time to this last dirt wagon track that ended once and for all at our bush place i don't know  if i ever write a story about him i expect it to sound something like flannery o'connor even though no one in our family has ever needed a wooden leg   there it was a very thick book one i did not have to carry back to school the seven hundred and fifty-seven hardcover pages of hulbert's story of the bible  the title page declared the complete bible story running from genesis to revelation told in the simple language of today for young and old   quote continues   a year ago in a used bookstore i found a salesman edition of this book  the agent is instructed you should try to sell the two dollar and fifty cent edition with gold and ink stamping plain edges whenever you can   quote continues   and i laugh i often wonder if you have to tell salesmen that i mean they must be pretty slow somewhere but  but my both my mother  bought the ink stamped only in blue cloth plain edges for a dollar fifty   first the continuous stories of the pictures and then that expanded into the tempting evocative condensious and nevertheless endlessly expansive stories of the words  i devoured that book for years  its very large size was very useful as well  for years my mother did not understand how fast i could read and when she called up the stairs for me to get down here and do something useful i could always shove whatever book i had under the bedclothes and yell back i'm reading the bible book and at least stop her lecture on two words junk  when look at that book now i realize that despite several years of biblical studies at colleges and universities much of my fundamental image of the hebrews in their strange desert world and of course i've never seen a desert remains based on hulbert and the pictures in hulbert  and so despite what i knew about the absolute truth of the bible an emotional conviction that i would never be able to unsettle from the depths of my as the hebrew scriptures have it my splochna  my most innermost bowels  nevertheless i read the bible stories pretty much as i read the greek myths in the tiny blue books out of the treadwell school library  schools that i've never yet been able to find anywhere either in libraries or in used book stores  books which offered the stories of jason of theseus of owl grey wise athena of medina with her dreadful tempting hair of odysseus scrabbling with pigs and one-eyed giants and the wrath of achilles and the stupefying beauty of helen of procrustes with his terribly strange bed that never fitted anyone of venus riding her shell up on the ocean's foam  i had never seen an ocean but the thunderstorm smashing the water on turtle poi point   turtle lake against indian point filled me with awe and dread  of fleeces with golden sheep and minotaurs and flying too close to the sun and falling falling smashing into the sea but incredibly lifted up poised on the noses on the snouts of dolphins  what were dolphins  and the slender woman running into the transformation of a delicate  branchy tree like the thousands of poplars or birch or willows or spruce or pine  uh it wouldn't be pine  they were too scraggily   but surrounded me at the farthest northern edge of the world to be transformed from a woman into a tree to preserve your virginity  what was that virginity   now the mother of jesus mother help me  but the mother of jesus in hulbert was mary the young woman  for the reverend jesse lymond no hint of sex could exist in the bible which requires some very fancy writing indeed   in all the one hundred and sixty-eight stories there is not a hint of the existence of the song of solomon for example  well perhaps the convenient excuse that a song cannot be a story  but then there's issac for example who in hulbert certainly has abram for a father and sarah for a mother but ishmael has only his mother hagar  as a child i did wonder what ishmael was doing in abram's tent all the time and perhaps he also was what popeye in the free press prairie farmer comics would have called an orphink   but laugh even for luther mary is jungfrau  that's the german technical word for it which was certainly never explained to me  so it remained for christmas hymn theology round yon virgin mother and child   in the original the holy pair is mentioned  there is no mention of the virgin mother   to finally inform me in the words of my sister whom i asked   never touched by a man   what's the matter with a man touching you  she laughed that's for me to know and you to find out  in the maddening superiority of every older sister that has ever existed  and so all i could do was yell at her you don't know anything either  but of course she knew  she did  for all that i knew she knew everything that i didn't which was certainly enough   to remind you of my writerly greeting liars ought to have good memories my friend do you have a good memory  or to touch the ambiguity lurking in sidney's phrase of plurals do you have good memories   god save us all from the present writing fad of miserable childhoods   give poet word activist robert bly half a blank page and ten minutes on t v and he will out-miserable both novelist patti reagan davis  her father and mother are much better known than she  and also t v star rosanne arnold whose parents now pray not to be known at all  genuine suffering is never a fad and never irrelevant   you have good memories regardless of whether they are happy ones because you are a good writer  and my memories are good too because in my child's world to be a storywriter was to be a liar  you concocted made up stories  when one writes fiction there is to put it simply and by our own admission no actual literal smellable and touchable reality to which the words you cluster onto the page respond  there is no literal brown cow hiding in the bushes   in my growing up world there was only one true book  the one book written by god himself long ago  or rather as i was told written by holy men always men only at god's dictation  men like go god's   like jesus' beloved disciple john who could explicate the entire universe in words of mostly one syllable  and this is a miracle   that which was from the beginning   that's two   three  biblical quote continues   as a writer i'm not for the moment interested in saint john's joy  i'm exorcised by his word by his writing the seeing hearing touching he seems to declare as so obviously so simply a part of the world's word   my childhood such a tapestry of hearing and speaking words in three languages and of seeing and reading and writing words in two of them gave me such an overwhelming gift of good memories that my good memory forces me to conclude with an affirmation it was that very interweaving of languages which made me a writer   there was never any doubt about when which language could or should be used but the necessary frictions between them destroyed the thoughtless complacency often demonstrated by monolingual people about what language may be or how it works   to try and explain to somehow translate or transliterate the possible vaporous ungraspable abstractions of literary or theological high german or english into the tightly circumscribed cryptic graspabilities of low german   that's all i ever spoke to my mother and father for example  drove me far into the wilderness of each language's particular genius  sometimes i couldn't find my way out  the languages didn't work none of them  a bit seemed clear in this language another bit in that or the other but never all in one   sometimes as i crashed hithering on my mother would say i know already i know what you mean and of course i was certain she didn't  how could she  i hadn't even said it   but then again perhaps she did   she died in nineteen fout forty  seventy-nine   and in my memory she is a mellow very gentle and wise woman who if you disagreed about something on which she had a strong conviction  and this happened often  she would sometimes say not always well that's enough talking now  i'll pray about it   and then i knew i might as well give up   she had in care incredible  cosmic connections   very likely they're even better now   the point for me is every writing reflects a literal reality  whether that reality is physically historically verifiable or not really does not matter   writing can and does create realities more truly experiential than mere facticity and therefore the distinction commonly made between a true story and a fiction or a myth beyond factual verifiability is literarily without useful meaning  reading for over half a century has convinced me that the best writing is often a more powerful experience of the actual world then the personal so-called firsthand actual experience sniff   we all know that  you all know that  you and i thousands of other readers have seen the prairie far beyond our individual limited perception because in as   for me in my house in thorasus lintus' eyes  no one who has ever read naomi woolf's the beauty myth can ever again consider the women displayed in contemporary advertising and see them in the same old way   you'll have to excuse me  i'm blurting out matters of serious import with unconscionable boldness   you and i have discussed this often and will again and again because the creation of formerly unsuspected realities with words is all our writing is about or all it needs to be about   and the way in which saint john in his letter deals with this matter confirms me   and i do appreciate a hebrew confirmation especially one with a boost from greek theoretical philosophy  the word of life at the beginning for me the overwhelmingly powerful hebrew creation story is the one where everything that is comes into existence when god said and it was   so look around you   god what a writer sniff   let me wander into another word world and tell you how the excremental world of sewers shaped my writer's imagination  i'll begin by offering you a relatively polite placement of  the story  it is called the opening toilet of edson alberta and it was commissioned by alberta culture  not the subject  just the story   and well you know uh alberta culture one must tread very lightly on both the sacred and the excremental  after this initial politeness we can get on to extrapolating implications which might be more fun   so here is the opening toilet of edson alberta   and and i have a point to this 
Canada	 so cough this is the first letter and it's called for the benefits of a poster the discovery of deserts giants and sewers  my dear friend   a writerly greeting with a text by the late algernon sidney  very late actually  somewhere uh before uh sixteen eighty-three  his plotting discourses on government is has   one bit of ambiguous advice for people in our profession and it is this  liars out to have good memories   it has always made me happy to know that if you and i had not been writers we would never have met  but since we are both we did meet and in that way we were mutually responsible for at least the possible beginning of our friendship   the contemporary world places a most disproportionate emphasis on individual freedom  we call self-determination a right with a general understanding it is worth dying for even though everyone knows how much of our life is quite beyond our determination word our control  the time and country of one's birth one's parents one's genetic programming the food one is fed the very size of one's toes or nose or cock or breasts any of these and or a thousand other personal details can be critical traumatic of life importance and every one is quite beyond our self determination  the fact that i have a certain type of red colour blindness could presumably at some point kill me though it hasn't yet and nevertheless it has certainly prevented me from becoming the airplane pilot or painter i sometimes as a child dreamed about  while at the same time it grants me the freedom to walk about sometimes quite unselfconsciously in clothes of embarrassing colour combinations as close friends tell me  this uncontrollable genetic inheritance apparently granted me by my mother who herself had a superb eye for colour may very well be the reason why since the age of six i have found it necessary to inflict upon myself the essential suffering of chewing my fingernails   if laugh human beings have developed towards any kind of freedom beyond the other animals it is surely because of their developed ability to think in image and abstraction  the saskatchewan homestead where i was born had more animal than human companionship to offer  the behaviour of cows when i had to herd them in the unfenced bush was highly instructive to me  cows wanted some simple things  they wanted to eat grass to drink water to protect and nurse their calves to lie about and chew their cud and at various times they   to mount and be mounted by another cow  now this latter process seemed to be the only fun they ever had  it could continue for an entire day  such a cowish expression of intimate bodily concern for one another  never evident between them otherwise  one after another they hoisted themselves ponderously up on their back legs and leaped before they missed which as they sometimes did to clasp the afflicted or playful one again and again offering their clumsy mysterious solicitude  the arrival of any scrawny bull however instantly changed all that into domineering into a great deal of roaring of bellowing okay okay i'm here just get out of the road i'll take care of it shoving everyone aside and simply doing the same thing in his massive pointed way violent and fast  and that finished the fun and the caring  after they all stood around a bit as uh as   it seems in sort of growing discouragement each cow went back to her solitary boring normality of tearing up grass  it happened often enough but the cows never seemed to anticipate  that the bull would spoil their cowish delight enjoy it then chase   em them away  they outnumbered him twenty to one before he would do it   truly stupid these cows  they never remembered anything  all they seemed to know was that was  immediately under their broad wet noses  they never seemed to have thought like there should be grass here for example or we should keep this bull away or he'll finish our fun and games  never  on the other hand my mother and i talked of all sorts of possibilities that hadn't even happened yet  my mother might say that bull must have been lawrence's  scrub broken out of his fence again  if he let that scrubby beast run around following its nose  lawrence will have every farmer mad at him again from here to  estevan just like last year   and i'd respond hopefully maybe somebody'll load up his gun or rifle or something and shoot it   our house never had a rifle in it   even when our neighbours came by hunting in fall as they often did their heavy rifles stayed in the their wagon or their saddles or at worse tilted against the wall in the step outside the door  my mother would not so much as talk about guns especially  wilful ones  of course my subsequent ignorance of guns transformed them into a fascinating mystery which is why i mentioned of it every  word chance i had at whatever length i could spin out  my mother would shake her head stop talking like that nobody will shoot anything and change the subject  does nellie still hide in the bush so much  she doesn't want to come home  maybe we should hang this small bell on her   thinking into these matters now it seems to me that  subliminally i already knew at the age of seven or eight about the time when i began milking and discovered at the tips of my fingers the refined continuous possibility of pain if one seriously chewed one's nails i  uh squeezing tough bush tips taut with milk can build up excruciating levels  i knew that the human ability to think to image was inextricably linked to our ability to our ability to speak  the language of my mother and myself was somehow our mutually agreed upon sound image of the observably factual world   in an instant we could create the world in sound unhindered by place or by time past present future simply offer more possibilities without any of the world having to be actually physically present  what an incredible gift language   with a puff of air you could conjure up nellie surely the stupidest of brown cows without dragging that huge and invariably spring green grass shit-slimed lump of bovinity into the house with you   what power of dealing with the world   words what incredible freedom   years later i recognized that the hebrew myth of human creation underscored this same concept  perhaps i had heard the strange story of eve and adam mutilated too often from too many pulpits to notice this understanding about language earlier  in genesis chapter two adam is alone in eden and in the process of naming the animals that is inventing human language and he discovers that none of them are fit for him  somehow language itself the names he gives the animals and he is free to gi give call  them anything he wishes reveals to him their distinct animal natures  these creatures are different from me  they are not my fit companions   now when he complains to yahweh about this yahweh puts him to sleep and makes eve out of adam's rib   now by an inexplicable linguistic accident the english words  man and woman mirror the image the hebrew pun on the two words used in the original story a pun which in turn presumably mirrors the physical pun of yahweh's playing on adam as it were a linguistic echo of that duplication with a significant difference  i first noticed this curiosity because the pun doesn't work in german  mann und weib share neither sound nor sense nor even a single letter   but luther in his translation thought this word play so crucial that he invented a word by force using man  mann and then attaching a feminine ending to it   having to change the a to a umlaut  m&auml;nnin he called it to put the pun across  the germans are much too logical for such oxymorons as  mann and m&auml;nnin and the word exists only in luther's bible laugh at genesis chapter two verse twenty-three  you can look it up   as an aside that particular genesis story of human creation  there is an earlier one in chapter one  has always struck me as ambiguously problematic  the language pun is essential to the story because it seems yahweh is playing a joke on adam  adam wants a companion and help be fit and proper for himself  well yahweh makes him one out of himself  adam laughs because of course he gets the joke and names eve accordingly  he's been practicing naming creatures after all  me man  you woman   but it seems yahweh has the last laugh  in the very next chapter this special arrangement of a health mate would be so incredibly helpful to get them both kicked out of paradise  wow that's a helpful companionship alright  it's a big cosmic joke i'd say  in my less hilarious moments i find the native canadian yellowknife story of human creation first recorded in english in an eighteen thirty-six much more helpful and i intend the pun  uh that yellowknife story also begins with a solitary man but it centres on his living with a ptarmigan  that is an animal which in hebrew terms is prohibitively different from man  and then making and the two of them making  a pair of snowshoes   man ptarmigan and snowshoes it's a superb story  you should look that one up too   you can read it in braying head if you want to   well in beginning with speech it followed that in learning how to read i was making the next step into image and abstraction that of physically seeing of physically seeing a commonly agreed upon symbol of the sound which in turn was the image of the factuality of the world alright  i experienced all around me  and obviously that concept would work itself back into a different direction as well  if it comes from the factuality of the world it can also work itself back in a different way   i could see also see the symbol of the sound which was the image of a world i might never yet have seen but which existed somewhere either in actuality or in the imagination of the maker of the symbols   i will return to discuss this latter point  for the moment let me say that i devoured the miracle of language written of book  in nineteen seventy-one a former teacher told me that by the time i finished grade two that is june nineteen forty-three i had read every book in the treadwell saskatchewan school district library  now granted the entire district consisted of a one room one log school laugh with four shelves of very worn books some in classroom sets and a small cupboard with doors that stood directly below the window high on the east wall  i still remember the tiny knobs on the library cupboard doors  they were the first machined knobs i had ever seen  they were so absently round and smooth with a screw in their centre  the school door itself had a metal knob you had to turn to open  on our farm you opened things from outside by pulling on leather loops nailed onto them or from inside by jerking a string that lifted the outside latches  in nineteen seventy-one my former teacher whom i had not met since nineteen forty-three told me about my early reading as we leaned out of the big hole of where the school's large west windows used to be the ones overlooking the hallowed space where the ball diamond had been the sod-covered barn where we used to stable our horses for the day and the hill  where we slid on our sleds and skis all winter and wrestled each in the snow when we as we always did spilled  the log shell of the school still existed twenty-one years ago  its high roof still kept out most of the rain 
Canada	 she concludes with a quotation from donna haraway's essay a manifesto of of cyber for cyborgs and thus makes explicit her association of the aesthetic project of cyberpunk and the political project of what she terms postmodern feminism  she concludes cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate  quote continues   there are however extremely good reasons to be sceptical of the alliance wrought by hollinger   first cyberpunk is an almost exclusively a male domain  in the words of pat murphy an award winning author of feminist science fiction speaking on a women's panel on the status of science fiction today she writes or said at the time that cyberpunk is largely a  boys' club   and a quick rundown of the major cyberpunk authors would reveal such  uh the names are run from gibson to sterling from k w jeter lewis shiner uhm joseph shirley uh largely all men and with the perhaps the only major exception of the recent novel by pat cadigan called sinners which has just come out   a second reason for scepticism is the fact that cyberpunk's interest in demonstrating the permeability of the human body does not ultimately displace or even volatize what are sorry volatize the category of man rather the masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality  it's a long phrase that i will sketch out further later on  the masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality in gibson's neuromancer represents what arther kroker describes as the  hyperinfusion of power by a male sex which seeks to hide the privileging of the phallocentric gaze by theorizing the disappearance of its power into seduction   it is my contention that much of cyberpunk's problematization of the humanist subject and the real simulation opposition inscribes an acute anxiety of male displacement even as it heralds the age of homo datum   the electronic space which at once threatens male power while simultaneously offering new opportunities for dominance is called cyberspace  in gibson's novel it refers to the quote consensual hallucination experienced by computer operators that the network that they work in is a separate geographical space an imaginary realm of pure information which can be accessed through a set of electrodes placed at the temples  what happens is the computer operator puts this headband on ah closes his eyes and upon opening his eyes he is entered into this  this inner world that's at once an extension of his of his own mind  the console operator loses contact with empirical reality and opens an inner eye on vistas of data  looks out upon this is a quotation from neuromancer the steeped scarlet pyramid of the eastern seaboard fishing authority burning beyond the green cubes of mitsubishi bank of america and high and very far away the spiral arms of military systems forever beyond reach   neuromancer is to many the first and last word in the cyberpunk genre  it is for hollinger the c p limit test   c p for cyberpunk   its hero is a console cowboy that's what these hackers are called  console cowboys called case  case is one of the an elite group of hackers who know the secrets of breaking into and extracting data from the secret piles uh in corporate in corporate systems  console cowboys are the lone bandits of a society in which information has become the most valuable commodity and the chief currency of exchange  their computers become more and more to be more than simply the tools of their trade but the very condition of their identity and their being   the first one cough which begins the story is this  the sewer is the conscience of the city   quote continues   this is from victor hugo les mis&eacute;rables eighteen sixty-two  on august the seventeenth nineteen fifty-two a few   y years weeks before i entered my last year of high school i bought victor hugo's massive novel les mis&eacute;rables the english edition one thousand two hundred and twenty-two pages long published in nineteen thirty-one by the modern library of the world's best book the giant series translated by charles e wilbur  that same summer i worked on the construction crew that was laying the first water and sewer mains under the streets of creighton the town where i lived  i was seventeen  creighton population eight hundred had of course no bookstore  neither did nearby lethbridge population twenty-two thousand  but sometime earlier i had discovered that the stationery store on seventh street south did offer a back corner with a few world classics  none of which had ever been written in canada of course   in december nineteen fifty-one i had bought my first book there pickwick papers by charles dickens and i spent all of christmas day except the compulsory sunday morning uh church service morning uh lying on the living room couch laughing myself into fits until my mother whose gift to me the book was decided she had made a mistake in letting me choose it   she had had no choice  i wanted a book for christmas and she could not read english  but to waste an entire serious holiday laughing   fortunately i was a fast reader though enjoyment and coughing slowed me down on this one   but les mis&eacute;rables was no novel of laughter and forgetting  not even in a brilliant windy southern alberta summer sunday of the early fifties  nor can the present world tour musical version of that story make it that   as hugo states in his nineteen sixty-two preface the book deals with the degradation of man by poverty the ruin of women by starvation and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night    now the fact is that most modern canadians like myself are immeasurably fortunate  not one of these conditions has ever really applied to us  nevertheless in july nineteen ninety-one when i walked along the beautiful streets of present-day creighton i remember the deep trenches that piled up the earth here in pyramidal rows thirty-nine years ago the sewers that surely still lie where i helped place them and i also think of the hero of les mis&eacute;rables jean valjean carrying his unconscious enemy with such ineffable honour through the immense leviathan sewers of eighteen thirty paris   to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave    now anyone in their right minds knows that the prairie town is  not paris france  such knowledge is particularly obvious to those who year after year live in such a town  the main irrigation ditch which still marks the southern boundary of creighton does not run through the middle of it like the seine through paris that ditch which then watered all the gardens and the small strawberry patches and corn and bean fields which filled every cistern filled under and beside every tiny wooden house through an intricate web of overgrown ditches supposedly clept clear kept clear  of weeds and wading widdling children by the one hired town worker who was all of the at the same time the constable the volunteer fire chief the dog catcher the wooden sidewalk repairman and the waterman   that ditch of reverse tributaries was certainly no seine river   the glazed clay and the much larger concrete sewer pipes which the workers of bennett and white limited edmonton nested in the sand fitted together and buried beneath the streets in nineteen fifty-two were nothing at all like the legendary architectured paris sewers begun somewhere in the middle ages and which in the nineteenth century had become both a grave and an asylum for crime intelligent social protest liberty of conscience and every conceivable human debauchery as hugo writes day and night   i know personally that most of the creighton sewers were too small even for a child to crawl into   not a single one of them was then large enough for a big man to walk in erect and leave alone carry another draped over his shoulder   and i at seventeen was certainly no no  bruneseau who in eighteen oh five would be the one man in all of napoleon's empire brave enough to enter the paris sewers and then spend seven years expanding their network  in fact when i was hired on the first day of the creighton  project in less than two months before it was completed i was fired  like everyone else bennett and white hired in creighton  i was a labourer a grunt when our work was mostly fitting and carrying things of digging them up or burying them in places designated by the foreman and various bosses all who came  all of whom came from somewhere else  a nice brainless business being a grunt  you just do everything anyone orders you because you're right down there at the bottom with the sewer pipe as low as you'll get without more digging which you'll have to do yourself   i however was a shade less grunty than most for some reason  because i could read and write  i can't remember anyone having asked me to demonstrate it  on the very first day the project engineer pointed at me and the  fat foreman said you go with him  so there i was frequently without a shovel riding about town  in the engineer's brown model a ford  a curiosity even then  the rod and chain man   while my fellow grunts heaved sand and gravel and cement into the grinding maw of a mixer or backfilled around pipe deep in the trench  or muscled clay joints and concrete manholes sectioned above the trucks i held a graduated stick motionless or anchored what i at first supposed was an endless measuring tape   hold it right there  don't move it  but quickly discovered it was a chain a steel chain certainly  but nothing at all like the one riveted around jean valjean's neck to march him to the prison galleys of toulon   if my life were a m massive   romance like les mis&eacute;rables where everyone especially the villains always and continuously return until all are either dead or married which in most romances not hugo's is amounts  to the same thing i would by now have met that engineer again   perhaps five years older than i a third year civil engineering student at the university of alberta on his summer job   his blond tough and compact body shorter than mine  his slightly lopsided grin with a tooth missing on the right side  but i cannot remember his name nor will he remember the gangly kid he left to lounge in the shade of his model a while the other grunts sweated and gasped in the burning sun and he argued with the foreman  i didn't lounge often for within two days i had learned the grunt's basic survival rules  one  never sit down   two  never stand with your hands in your pockets   but often the engineer did not need me and then i worked with the rest and that was when the others who were never told to sit in the model a got their small revenges on me  the heavy ends of the pipes  the extra shovelling where there was room for only one to work  the deepest mud after a rain when the huge planks supported  the trench walls oozed and bulged ominously between their horizontal braces   he was wading in the hideous muck of the city all dripping with slime   quote continues   the best trench workers quickly proved to be the older immigrant men who had somehow survived the war and had managed with what was left of their families to get into canada   those were the refugees displaced persons or d ps as they were called derisively or schmoes as we called them i don't even know how to spell that name word after the subhuman critters in the very popular little ab li'l   abner comic strip   they worked at anything without question   their lack of english saved them from the pr   the precise details of racism but it certainly did not save them from its pervasive abusive tone  that racism bothered me   mostly to be honest about it for myself   after all though born in canada i was of refugee parents myself  at home we had never spoken but an obscure german dialect a language i used to explain the foreman's peremptory orders to my fellow  mennonite d p labourers   but tired muscles and common sweat soon pushed such attitudes in a work gang aside   work hard enough together and you get to deci   deride a man not for his race but for his evasions for his laziness   it seems to me now that thinking back to that nineteen fifty-two  that male concepts about women are much harder to change than their prejudice about race   oh the summer girls walking by with their brief blouses knotted up under their breasts their white shorts their arms and legs week by week turning a deeper more olympic golden brown under that libidinous sun  
Canada	 psychologists inform us cough that boys of fifteen to seventeen may be the most sex-dominated creatures on earth   if i na want was that i wanted it kept it strictly private   my horniness i could not then have expressed it that way was a burden i carried in absolute private files an ogre to be wrestled with and occasionally indulged somehow or word or loved and fought with again fought over or into true guilt and then  inev inevitably back into guilt again with remorse and inner rage   so given that to hear such tangled privacies brayed about the streets by the other young grunts in our work gang every time a beautiful girl  they were all beautiful always  every time a girl became visible embarrassed and humiliated me  wolf whistles cries howls obscene offers brutal and violent gestures  the older immigrant men worked on oblivious  after surviving both stalin and hitler they must have found these endlessly repeated performances merely trivial and banal  but i listened  i couldn't stop myself though i mostly pretended to ignore them as i tried to ignore the sexual bragging about weekend conquests  and so i came to prefer the depths of the trench   from below at least they sounded indistinct merely animals yowling   the young engineer spoke very little  he never said a word when a woman passed   sometimes he would smile but he kept on working  one of his main jobs was to make certain that the sewer was laid absolutely on gradient and that's where his arguments with the foreman started  time and again to prove his points about the violation of benchmarks he had set i'd have to slide down into the cool sweet earth and work my extended measuring rod as directed from one joint to another along those interlaced pipes and he'd sight at each with his level and then he'd be expostulating with the foreman again  you put that little bump like you say when you lay the pipe  and you cut capacity look almost a third   diagrams formulas circled numbers racing left-handed across the spiral notebook with that ever sharp precise draftsman pen   the sewer is a cynic   it tells all   the longest biggest line cut down main street which was also alberta highway number four from mountain view pass to lethbridge just recently paved of course so we really sliced it up  wide and mountainous along the north side and the smaller branch sitting  right angles   you go right down the middle of the str   street uh side of the street and then you go out right angles to each of the buildings   after carving up the residential streets with feeder lines we had begun very deep eighteen feet perhaps on the east main and as august lengthened the huge trencher steadily chewed us inch by inch towards the town hotel near the western end of the business district and the arguments got louder  you do that you gotta got to lay twice the diameter  it's supposed to handle all this town's shit   throughout the summer i had wondered how whoever it was had decided on the various sizes of pipes anyway   had they interviewed every homeowner and business about the length of residence and then gone into each outhouse and measured it for hole capacity and percentage fill   besides all the other crap that always gets word  shoved into sewers the engineer muttered grimly to me who had no opinion but at dislocated moments might provide an ear  shit apparently was the least of it   why in this sewer summer of nineteen fifty-two at eighty-two cents an hour it made the m it was the most i'd ever earned did i begin with hugo rather than with any other modern library giant two ninety-five each then cough like cervantes word pushkin joyce tolstoy that   the ones i bought latter   perhaps it was cough because of its giant intestine  the cloaca which as hugo explains it has been the disease of paris throughout history  in part five of les mis&eacute;rables he describes it for fifteen pages and then he devotes another twenty-three to getting jean valjean with marius on his shoulder out of that sewer  well why   why did i buy this book  perhaps to be blunt about it i was wondering how i dealt how one dealt with shit   clearly   how did one   clearly the world including me was full of it and here on the apparently open prairie there was neither enough there were neither enough bushes nor even spaces as it seemed to me there'd always been in estevan saskatchewan where i lived the first twelve years of my life there weren't enough there were not  bushes nor spaces for it to be properly voided unseen and thereafter to be b permitted the privacy of its individual disintegration   in sunny southern alberta it seemed necessary to rip up the landscape and yell about it in the streets   cough holding this immense novel in my hand in nineteen ninety-one i am suddenly certain that i bought it originally because of the sewer for i had read the story much earlier in saskatchewan when i was eleven a simplified version by solomon cleaver that had from somewhere contained pictures  in that one room treadwell school i'm reading jean valjean as the book is called leaning against the warm galvanized guard of the heater which is two gas barrels welded together  on the temporary stage across the one end of the room five girls are practicing good king wenceslas for the christmas concert  the black and white picture when i turn the page is captioned  jean carries the wounded marius to safety through the filthy sewers of paris   jean is lank-haired old man  his face contorted  above his waist in what seems to be molten lead   behind him the glooming maw of the sewer twists away into darkness  carried to safety  when i go to find jean valjean in the university library i discover it in the canadian literature section   it seems solomon cleaver was a young minister of winnipeg who decided to tell the stories in his own words rather like hulbert with the bible  not even god could write well enough for him  the reverend cleaver repeated the story more than eight hundred times to over one hundred thousand people and was obliged to reject one invitation every four which crowded upon him  so the publishing word continues he was prevailed upon to have it published first in nineteen thirty-five and then after ten reprintings clarke irwin of toronto brought it out as a true canadian classic   and the pictures fourteen in all from an early-thirties french movie   cosette leaning over a dying jean looks like greta garbo in golden ringlets   and the sewer  surely every young lover deserves to be carried from the fallen barricades of his revolution to safety through a filthy sewer  how could solomon cleaver squeeze victor hugo's gigantic story onto one hundred and nineteen book-sized pages   jean valjean's passage through the sewer shrinks from thirty-nine pages to six hundred and twenty-seven words  the final two chapters are transformed into a single verse from get this a scottish covenanters' hymn   how truly classic canadian   well paris france is a place but creighton is most certainly a place also   in late august nineteen fifty-two the trench had reached the western end of town cough and my fellow grunt and i were hand tunnelling a side branch of it under the sidewalk in front of the hotel directly beneath the ladies and escort sign  and those of you who are old enough to know what that means in the in the history of alberta drinking   we are tunnelling this little side branch of the main tunnel  cough   we took turns  one lying on his back and loosening the and falling   and pulling back a short spadeful of earth while the other used a long shovel to throw it up onto street level   at the moment of crisis i could see only my i could see at my feet only my friend's head sprinkled with red clay and talking  talking low german as he had all afternoon  me intense with listening   holy shit you buggars  how we ever gonna going to get this   fuckin fucking job done with that speed  it was the foreman   his bulging face tilted down at us maybe about to topple right into the ditch on top of us  but i was somewhere very far away  nineteen forty-four  i was watching refugees push their carts through the frozen mud of stalin's oppression surrounded by the german army's disastrous retreat across the endless devastating vistas of the ukrainian steppes  shut yourself i yelled up  you workin working so hard in the hotel every day gettin getting drunk   well after that we had nothing to do but drop our shovels right there  don't you move em them   and get out of that ditch and hoof it over to the office portable and pick up our last cheque   the foreman drove his pickup there to tell the bookkeeper and he sure as hell wasn't giving no smartassed little bastards a lift   so we walked east the entire length of main street all cut up with bumpy trenches and i felt stupid because my big mouth had gotten john  fired but he just laughed   he was two years older than i but his father had vanished long ago in stalin's siberia and he and his mother and younger siblings were true refugees working at everything to make a living  anything to make a living   he laughed and said school started in a week anyway  he was going to school and learn to be a good canadian just like me  well here it is nineteen ninety-one in a prairie town  it's uniquely its own place in the darkened summer sun  spread across the wide land dark trees and roofs surrounded by the white spray of irrigation sprinklers moving steadily across and around the fields  no more men in gumboots leaning on shovels opening up little ditches   welcome to treadwell best in the west   population five thousand two hundred and eighty   here and there among the bungalows the small old houses sit well below street level  the green rushes grow in the seepage along the main ditch  the giant cottonwoods still lean over its surprisingly clear water  pouring over falls between the same old timbers that might just might still record the scars of my boyhood knife   beautiful pastoral the air shining to the line of the rockies and the drift of snow on big chief that always that always  distant and holy mountain   no revolutionary barricades ever anywhere on these streets so it is perhaps unnecessary to seek that strange light in the treacherous filthy safety of sewers   at present the sewer almost realizes the ideal of what was understood in england by the world by the word   respectable   the filth comports itself properly   the filth comports itself decently   this is a very long letter my friend and i'm going to end it  but you're laughing  i know it because your imaginative nose has caught a wiff of what i've avoided in this story perhaps for the convenient benefit of alberta culture  but you're not thinking about my childhood preoccupation with outhouses either here so carefully wrapped around in the ultimate class of translated from the french and shaped into the marginal acceptability of decent sewers  no   you have caught a wiff of something much more intriguing and you're waiting  you're waiting  i am in that work crew busy beside that long ditch folded open out of the gravel street a lanky muscular kid naked from the waist up and so brown i must have been rolled in summer sunlight all summer and a girl is walking by  slender or sturdy   tall or tiny  long skirts or short skirts  that doesn't matter  nothing but age will stop the words that are sprayed from every mouth into the bright air   when an old woman walks by there is silence  not necessarily respectful but just silence  but for a girl words words   what are those words word-lover   why don't i write them down for you to read
