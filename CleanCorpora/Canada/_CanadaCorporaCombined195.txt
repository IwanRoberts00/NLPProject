 recording starts mid-sentence whole bunch a  of guards on the right hand side  no way   they're now playing the split     it's over curling  it's curling and is it heavy   oh boy   oh boy   oh boy   oh that is not a good shot   a reprieve for british columbia   oh   that may be the biggest break in the curling game   not only was it a bad call but a very bad shot     exasperated breath, like a horse snort   the only thing that can save heidi hanlon now is if julie sutton hits and rolls out and maybe she can get in around those corner guards   how the emotions change  a moment ago jodie sutton was so upset with her shot now she's relieved because kathy floyd was upset with her shot   oh yes   this is where pressure comes into the game of curling   there's that roll you suggested was there but it's just a little too far  well that was not even a good curling shot don because  you have to play that rock to maybe hit and roll to the left hand side   take the play away from those corner guards and especially by rolling out   now you're gonna going to give heidi hanlon the opportunity to draw round these corner guards   see if they had've drawn to the open side don and julie sutton hit and rolled out they woulda would have just had a simply uh straight draw to split the house   it's the big shot for heidi   and they're gonna going to have to go hard on it to get it by the guard  and it's got kind of a lazy handle on it  that's my impression it's got very very little turn on it  now when you have a rock with very little turn it's gonna  going to just come off of the side  look at that   i mean it just takes the contour of the ice and goes right over  so now julie sutton who was ready to concede a single point on this tenth end and play for victory on an extra end has a chance to perhaps steal a point and win the game  she is going to try and get in behind those corner guards   well everything's worked out for julie this end   stopwatch in hand   watching her sister release the rock   hmm sh   she's got lotsa lots of room and  lotsa lots of weight   oh she's got a great curling shot   they gotta got to take it deep deep  deep   so now if you're heidi hanlon the pressure is on your shoulders because you must draw and catch a piece of the eight-foot  if you're to prolong this match and force an extra end   well they shoulda should've really been on that rock a little bit earlier because they could've maybe pulled it into the eight-foot   but the nice feeling is is that the other skip has to make the shot  simply to tie the game   hanlon wasted very little time in moving to the far end to  deliver this final stone of the tenth   oh how is it for distance  oh it's got something   unclear words   it's picked up something don   oh what a way to lose the game  look at that rock take off sideways   yeah   it's got a hair underneath it   oh what a way to lose a curling game  what a tough break for heidi hanlon and her new brunswick rink  and what a great win for julie sutton of british columbia   aw the game of curling was very cruel to heidi hanlon today  elaine jackson out there to congratulate the four members of this championship squad  julie and jodie sutton melissa soligo and karri willms  well they are deserving champions  trailing by three with three ends remaining   they stole two on the ninth end   and picked up a single point on the tenth  and they win it by a score of seven to five   tears of happiness for julie sutton jodie sutton melissa soligo and karri williams speaker error, should be willms the nineteen ninety-one canadian women's champions advertisements   a tough way to lose for heidi hanlon with her final stone picking up a hair but a great win for julie sutton and her british columbia team mates  the nineteen ninety-one canadian women's champions winning the  scott tournament of hearts here at saskatchewan place interviews and comments - - post game wrap up   i thought last night in the overtime before the pronghorns did win it that they looked tired and the bears were taking the play and  and you looked at th this last shift zukiwsky and gatto are both out there for two and a half three minutes  and in a three game series that's going to take your legs out of you in three days and uh  ah it could be the difference for the bears or not  tomorrow   well there were games during this season when there was a five-minute major and zukiwsky played the whole  five minutes   that's right   that's right  so maybe he can do it  but over three games in three days it's gonna  going to to be tough  strap a nu ninety-nine on his back if he's  gonna going to do stuff like that   puck at centre ice  christiansen has it for alberta  gets it ahead to esposito  esposito has a pair a of goals here tonight and he rifles it in across the line   deep in the horns' zone  leroux has it behind the net  he goes down   ends up underneath haney  haney has it  in the left corner  works it up the boards to strand  to the point for christiansen  his shot blown wide of the net   comes off the boards and carpenter has it there  wants to play it ahead to kita   carpenter instead weaves through traffic  dipsy-doodles and sends it in across the bear line  minute to go in the first period  christiansen has it behind the net   plays it ahead   and esposito lifts it high in the air and down the ice back to play  to harper   bears change 'em them up  tiltgen degner thompson out there   the forward unit hjertaas and trevor sherban on defence  and lethbridge able to clear   sherban'll lift it right back in  deep to the corner   harper back to play it  tiltgen in to forecheck  harper has it  plays it ahead to graham  that's broken up   it bounces at the side of the net  krooshoop has it  drops it off for harper  bears pen 'em them in pretty well  up the right side it goes to burns   burns plays it   that's off a bear and out to centre   trevor sherban plays it again for dean tiltgen and he'll just lift it deep into the zone   back to play it's harper  ten seconds left in the first period  harper plays it off the wall and down the ice   trevor sherban plays it into the penalty bench  three seconds to go  he sent the one of the penalty box attendants ducking   you gotta got to keeep alive down there   one of   get those uh cages on like they do in the spectrum  laugh   one of the big differences tonight evan is the forecheck for the bears  last night we commented on how good the pronghorns were breaking out of their own end and   we just saw this in the last three minutes and they couldn't make a pass to save their life  the other thing too is on this last series it  kinda kind of i think amplifies what's happened in the first  trevor sherban able to dump it deep in the lethbridge territory  make 'em them start out deep in their own end unclear word   make 'em them turn and go to their own corner and put it safe against the glass  the whole night  period's over  three nothing   the alberta golden bears in front of the lethbridge pronghorns  bears outshot the pronghorns sixteen eleven in that first period  quickly here's what happened in it  frank esposito opened the scoring the five thirty-three mark  with a delayed penalty   and paul strand let the shot go  esposito cashed in on the rebound  merv haney got an assist as well  unclear words goal at five fift  five thirty-three one nothing   then on the power play frank esposito won a faceoff   haney got it over to strand who passed it out front to esposito his second of the game and of the playoffs at eight twenty-five two nothing  then at nine twenty-eight terry degner his second of the playoffs  he scored last night   as he tipped a mike thompson shot from just inside the blue line past goaltender cavilla  hal christiansen got an assist there as well  three nothing after the opening period of play general hockey discussion, hockey news round up, advertisements and interview for next 15 minutes, 50 seconds   alberta golden bears up three nothing on the lethbridge pronghorns as referee george mccory gets set to toss the puck in to start the second period  frank esposito paul strand and merv haney will begin this  second period   and we look down at the bench i do not see mike jickling   and i don't know if we asked what his situation is whether we'd get an answer or not  these are the playoffs jeff so they  kinda kind of keep those things quiet  you don't wanna want to g    that's right  you're not gonna going to give away anything uh   unclear word the coaches have had to deal  with their play it's gotta got to be hurting without mike jickling now  strand over to pullishy  back over to goodkey   and it's cleared down the ice as the second period's underway  here come the horns at centre   with the puck is wobick   long shot glove save made by masson  he'll hold on  that was a long shot by wayne filipenko from well outside the blue line and dipped a little bit on masson  he had to reach out with a trapper and make the stop   and he has had a lotta lot of  action tonight  he's made a coupla couple of good saves but he does look sharp   uh no rebounds no bobbles and no hesitations on that uh   skipped goal  last night he hesitated and it cost him and   he's looking good  and a brilliant stop on zukiwsky in that end  last night   that's right   that's right  great great stop   and on the power play   esposito facing off against bannerholt   comes back to the left point  here's a shot by wobick  doesn't get through   the bears are able to clear  strand checked by wobick   it's cleared deep into the bears' zone again  and it's goodkey turns from behind his net over to pullishy and the bears  esposito to haney  long lead pass on the right side to strand  he's gotta got to step in on the right wing  let's a shot go and he whistled it wide on the blockers' side  esposito has it   to the corner for haney  haney out front comes back to the point  hjertaas with a chance  he'll send it to the corner it's knocked down however by riehl  and here come the horns in a three on two   riehl sends it to the corner for filipenko   they centre out front  that's unclear word away and a good play  good defensive play by strand  it comes out to centre ice   bears have it   sherban skating it down the right wing  sherban steps in across the line   takes a look sends it stop lead to the corner  in behind the lethbridge net   aaron zarowny was checked  simpson chasing after the puck against rieder  rieder has him all tied up   and here come the horns   leroux was spun around then gave aaron zarowny a little bit of a shave with that stick   zarowny with the puck  over to colin zaronwy  now behind the net for simpson  walking out front  tried to set it up for hjertaas who'd moved in   and one of the horns falls on top of the puck to negate that scoring opportunity  but the bears starting off well here in the second period  they're up three nothing  and once again uh law firm as you'd name them with a good nickname they own the pronghorns  the puck did not get outta out of the pronghorns' end  uh they cycle the puck  they're all very smart hockey players  they don't make dumb plays they don't take stupid chances and   e they're just a solid line  zarowny zarowny and simpson the law firm
