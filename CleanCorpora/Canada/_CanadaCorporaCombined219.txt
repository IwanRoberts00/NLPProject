 this is when the people crack  because when you're going through that identity crisis the students are right there to help you audience laugh   they're there every step of the way you know  for example like i've noticed this with first year teachers a lot uh i i dunno don't know  maybe you'll notice this when you start or uh maybe donovan  you've seen this a lot i dunno don't know  but they when you see them start teaching   they they they they dress well and  and a tie maybe   they look good de dah duh duh and they have the book and the  teaching and duh de duh de duh  and after a month you know you see them start coming with their jeans and and their t-shirt you know  and and then they start you know trying to act cool more and stuff like that  and then you start they start turning into teenagers you know audience laughs   word a lot  and and and it's really funny  and then and then all of a sudden they don't sleep very well any more and they start having problems  and because they're with the students all the time  so who you're gonna going to have the most interaction with are students you know  and students start by asking ah how's it going you know how are you doing  you look tired you know  what's going on word   oh we don't need to work today eh  no let's let's just talk about it a bit  you know and you know  and it it happens a lot  it happens a lot where where  the students the teachers become students again   you know they don't they're th they fall  back into to being a   a student and and that's when the trouble starts you know   i think that's when the trouble starts  so you have to you have to keep in mind that who you are you  you're no longer a student you're now a teacher   and i think that's that's my main thing  about ah about the identity crisis  and the reason why you have the identity crisis is be  tape side ends   question and answer session with audience at the start of the talk  okay uh first i uh i thought i'd talk about my my experience and how i got the job and et cetera  so uhm last year i was doing a final course at this time i had one course left  and at the same time i was working at a lot of  these little uhm private language schools  you know like word college and i worked at  one word on site and stuff like that  i was also doing the monitor program component  are you word familiar with this   audience member answers   has everybody done it done that   audience member answers   audience member answers   word   yeah it's like one of the first things they ask you on the c v so  some audience mumble   it's very very impressive  on your c v don't i put i didn't put  monitor i put teaching assistant   uh you know  and that's what i think you are so  aright alright so i was working   at the same at the same time that i was doing my degree and somewhere around this time february march i sent out i think seventy or eighty c vs to different school boards and just about every cegep kay okay   out of that i didn't get a call until august  fifteenth i think around august fifteenth  so the whole summer passed before i got a call  and then i got two job interviews   one in laval at uh pont-cartier and the other one was in saint-fran&ccedille;ois which is much farther   uhm and eventually i got the job at pont-cartier  which was a replacement   most of you if you think you're going to work in the cegeps  don't expect to get a uh a position   you'll probably get a replacement okay   which is unfortunate but always take it  uhm so i worked at pont-cartier for one session  and then at the end of that session i </- > i  uh got another job at rene-belanger in la   laval and that's where i am now okay  uh so that's basically what was going on uh or has been going on for the past year  ah getting into the cegeps is uh not exactly easy  out of the seventy c vs that i sent out i got uhm one two three four five six   i got five cegep interviews and one school board interview   outa out of seventy c vs  and most of my friends weren't three or four words  very impressed because they did not get any uh interviews at all  so if you get one or two you're really doing well okay  don't don't don't expect to send out seventy and get fifteen or word   you see most of the time you don't even get replies  th they don't even acknowledge you  or they send back information and tell you to send them more information which is a big pain and i never ended up doing that  but you probably should okay audience laughs   but i never did it because it's it's   a lot of running around   okay uhm   my personal experience i have uh two bachelor's degrees one in english literature and one in the tesl pronounced " tessil"   and uh i have all the experience that i just talked about   and uhm one of the uh one of the important things when the cegeps decide on who they're  gonna going to choose when they're selecting the candidates this is really important   the first  anybody doing a master's   you are   answers   mm mm you will   okay   answers   okay  are you starting it   have you started it  answers   okay  good luck  replies   uh most of the cegeps aren't   the first thing they don't w they look at  is not your degree   k okay that's the first thing  so don't do master's thinking oh hey do the master's and i'm  gonna going to get into a cegep  it doesn't work like that  for the english for teaching english as a second language in a cegep the first thing that they're going to look at is your experience  okay i i don't have a  bach bachelor's a master's   degree  i got the jobs based on my experience or i got the interviews based on my experience   uhm clears throat i know there's it's uh  there's a a misconception  that the master's will get you the interview and that's not true  the experience is i i think th   the experience is much more important   mkay okay   uhm and that's and the experience   can be almost anything   it doesn't matter where or what you do  if it's volunteer or anything put it on your c v  i had a two-page c v and when i was writing it i started to laugh because most of it's b s but i worked at those places and i put them down   and in the end they ask you about almost every one  audience member agrees   i worked at uhm  i volunteered at a community centre i put it down  i worked at concordia i did that monitor thing which is  such a   inaudible interruption from audience member     pardon me  apologizes for cutting in     ah okay three or four words   uh the the th sh the  monitor program is is uhm i don't think it's   uh th the greatest experience in the world   word   audience member comments   repeats and elaborates on comment   it might be  it might seem like a waste and i agree sometimes it's very badly run  sometimes you just end up giving out exams  audience member comments   it depends on the teacher yeah   audience member comments   but yeah but you don't put like i invigilated exams in your c v you put you were a teaching assistant  word it's really what you are   and uhm the the cegeps are just immensely impressed with it  and they don't know what the monitor program is so i didn't tell them audience laughter   sentence   uhm they asked what my uh my uh  experience was in the monitor program and i told them the truth you know  sometimes i invigilated sometimes i corrected and sometimes i taught   you know  but just the fact that you were a teaching assistant at concordia  it makes it it it's a big deal   and i'm sure that that's one of the big bonuses that i had on my c v uh compared to other people  so if you did do it don't don't be shy  put it on your c v  uhm so where am i  so yeah the first thing they look for is experience  the second thing i think is probably the degree  yemkay okay   the degree does not have to be a tesl degree surprisingly enough  many cegeps hire people without tesl degrees very very common  ah which goes back to my first point about experience being  more important  ah the people who get the degrees they might have a degree in  math or i dunno don't know fine arts  but they've taught overseas or they've taught somewhere and they get the interview and end up getting the job based on that experience   okay ah in terms of the degree the bachelor's degree is  uhhhh is i mean you can't go any lower than that  you can't go like teach with cegep degree  in terms of the master's there's this big controversy whether you should have the master's or not have the master's okay  unfortunately you're on uhm you're on the down the huge chunk word apparently an aside; followed by audience laughter   you're on the uh   if you look at uh i think nineteen ninety-three the reforms  came in   audience member responds   is that correct  audience member responds   two words were announced okay  audience member responds   so nineteen ninety ninety-six  so somewhere around nineteen ninety-three nineteen ninety-four  the reforms started to take place in the cegeps  and basically the hiring curve if you look it went kind of like this you know  uhm so around nineteen ninety-five  audience member comments   around nineteen ninety-five uh people were getting jobs like crazy  um now i graduated at the end of nineteen ninety-five so uh actually it's  push this curve over i'm not very good a math person  push this curve over a little bit cos uh word  in nineteen ninety-five there was more of them   but uh nineteen ninety-four ninety-five we were at a peak  and they were just creating job positions they had so many students it was crazy okay  unfortunately now we're up around here and there's no more positions being created or very very few okay  uh the cegeps that are creating positions at this point in time  are the cegeps that are completely unorganized some audience members laugh   so there's a catch twenty-two  you might get a position but it's gonna  going to be with a pretty unorganized cegep audience members laugh   ah so right now this positions  aren't being created  so uh there are some cegeps where you might be lucky enough to pick something up and get uh it's much more one or two words now  so the question is whether you need the master's or not   uhm and that's that's the big debate   because now they can be  here they couldn't be picky they could take anybody  three or four words   here they have to be a lot more picky  and uh i think masters' will start to grow in importance   not saying that you need one uh necessarily but it will grow in importance  so if you're thinking of doing one before getting a job uh think carefully about it you know  i'll go on to talk about the importance of masters' word  master's or anything at the end   uhm okay   and uh finally ah getting after once   you've looked at uh your experience and your degree okay uhm   the and analyzing your c v you'll finally  hopefully get the interview  the c v by the way i sent uh i sent  bilingual c vs  don't send english c vs only   in fact if you can avoid sending english c vs if you can send them in french it's really advisable okay  ah i know it sounds funny for an english teacher but the people who look at your c vs first are not anglophones term for english speaking canadians   they're the people in human resources okay  but i would send ah i sent bilingual cover letters and french and a french uh c v the the  rest of the c v was in french but the uh the  cover letter was bilingual  which is a good idea because a lot of cegeps especially if you write well uhm  now i don't i'm not a very good writer so i had someone else do my c v for me audience laughs   so it was a big trick  but uhm they do read the cover letter of the c v and check for grammar mistakes and check for ah style and everything else   which is you know something we don't think about but the university departments often do word cegeps don't  audience member agrees   so inaudible exchange between an audience member and speaker a, five seconds   laugh okay  so finally uhm if you're lucky enough you get a   a job interview   uhm   what can you expect in the interview  oh jeez the interviews are hell okay  you're gonna going to hate them  several audience members react   there's nothing to look forward to  they're hell  they're hard they're full of w a  lotta lot of lotta lot of  pressure uhm and they're not enjoyable at all   uhm draws in audible breath so okay  ah i put the interview as being uh the third thing that  you you get and it it's so important the interview about getting the job   the to getting the interview the experience and the degree counts  once you get the get into the interview  all that is forgotten okay  you could you could have zero experience and your your bachelor's degree you   coulda could have got a a  two point zero g p a four point zero is highest grade point average  you know   everything once you get into the interview is forgotten okay  they don't care about your experience they don't tar  care about your degree
