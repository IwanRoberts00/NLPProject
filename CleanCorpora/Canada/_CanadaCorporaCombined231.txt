 and i als i work at concordia full time as a lab instructor slash technician in biology so  that's why i make concordia jealous  i can recognize a concordia employee after a few leading lines  laughs with audience   so i wanna want to make  what i ususally do in any c p r course is ask everybody involved to introduce themselves and just say as much as they'd like to about why they're here   and that and also you can volunteer any  uh recounting of any experience you may have had calling nine one one or  doing the heimlich manoeuver or heaven forbid doing c p r  which in fact doesn't happen very often  people don't do c p r very often   so between amanda and liz who'd like to start  tape stops and starts again   now i think  i i don't keep track anymore  one of those things  but since the late seventies the very late seventies  and so i've seen trends come and go and different attitudes and whatnot  it i in spite of my ability like many support staff type employees here to bitch about the place it is a credit to the university that they have maintained however   at whatever a reduced level this training for employees  i i've always thought it was a good idea and it's in a way even better that they're doing their own c s s t  comission de la sant&eacute; et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; au travail  training now cough   and the end of the table here we have loralee who is in the process of becoming a c p r instructor tape stops and starts again  did i lose my chalk  i lost my chalk  na na na na na hm hm hm  okay tape stops and starts again   board a sort of outline  something to refer to since you don't have a complete manual  wow look at this chalk   so with the heartsaver if you recall from december ninety-three  what the heartsaver course was about was to help you respond to an emergency situation using c p r and the 'and' is long and drawn out similar techniques   and this type of an emergency is when anybody collapses  the heartsaver focuses on the adult victim and that's  as a responder here this is the ideal cour  the ideal course for someone who is willing to be responsive in this setting   if you were in working in a daycare or something then you would probably take a course that also included paediatric  type emergencies so the h the the  skills you will have to learn will include recognizing writing on chalkboard starts an emergency and being able to assess it and being able to respond writing on chalkboard ends   so these are skills to remember as well as the technique  respond  r e s p o n d  respond  okay  so this is something that i tend to focus on and this you get with the a b cs of c p r  which hopefully ring a bell with you  the techniques writing on chalkboard starts themsleves include the heimlich manoeuver and c p r writing on chalkboard ends   that's pretty well it for the actual techniques you have to learn  but this is the largest part of the course in that it has to be you have to be comfortable with your ability  and willingness to respond to a situation  they go hand in hand  if you're not if you don't feel able then you'll be less willing et cetera   and you might think after three years of no training or something i better not do anything  so the the best response for you always to have is to call for help  so if you're ever willing to do that   if you know remotely how to call for help then that will be an excellent response and something that not that many people are necessarily capable of tape stops and starts again   this is a very simple course designed to train people to be responsive in sudden death types of emergencies or sudden anything type of emergency involving adults   and there are in my mind two important parts to it and the most important part is as far as i'm concerned an ability and willingness to recognize an emergency and assess it and then respond  and of course once you get through recognition assessment and you  wanna want to get into a response then there are a couple techniques that you would do well to feel comfortable doing   especially if you've done this training before the onus is even more on you to assess yourself while you're here today because this is your opportunity to become comfortable and be sure that you understand something that you didn't understand before or that you improve a technique that you learned before  and really it's a very short simple course  the techniques to be learned are variations of the heimlich manoeuver and c p r   a s a single rescuer doing c p r on an adult victim  alright   so what's the backround that's usually gone into involve anatomy and physiology and risk factors for heart attacks and whatnot   but what i like to do right off the bat is to   aside right off the bat end aside is to ask you to try a rescue here   just to see if you remember anything  this isn't laughing in audience this isn't an assessment at all on my part  it's just to get you right away thinking along these lines  is anyone brave enough to uh go through a rescue with me   you're looking at me laugh tape stops and starts again  laughter   i think you must be   hey you read the manual last night  extracorpus speaker makes a comment tape stops and starts again   go up to personnel there and ask them the majority would say that everytime the doors of the emergency room fly open every time they get a call for something they still have that panicky feeling  so accept that and if with my victim and my rescuer here  the word stuff that i want you to be able to think about and try and relate to any situation including the mannequin that i word around here is what do you do if you find someone lying on the floor   she may have just collapsed in front of you or you just may find her like this  and this is this is a horrible thing   you've learned the assessment the a b cs but it's still a horrible thing to ever see someone obviously not doing what you would expect them to do  at concordia you especially at this campus it's such a comfortable campus campus there aren't a great many places to lie around  when you see someone lying down there's probably something wrong  so liz if you could tape stops and starts again   rule number one don't step over the victim laughter   what would be the first thing you would think   extracorpus speaker answers   okay and would you also think of who can help me  comments   i know that whenever at work even if i've seen someone cut themselves even when i myself slice my finger with a pipette i've thought  who can help  how wonderful  so it's go with these natural inclinations   hell call for help get people to help recognize that you're gonna going to panic in the first place and then think a b c   thank you very much  would you carry on  speaker zc begins to speak tape stops and starts again   you would approach the victim but first you should always watch out for what might hurt you  so if the room is full of smoke remove yourself from the victim  firefighters have to go into this and brave death  if the victim is in the water and you can swim and feel confident to rescue the victim lifeguards know this in greater depths as well  but always once you determine that someone has a problem i think  it's it's very normal for people to think that way  you think of saving yourself as well  so you check the environment if you can remove yourself and the victim that's great   if you can't you'll have to remove yourself   because there's no no point in having two victims  so in here this is a benign environment there's no big problem  you can feel free to approach the victim   because she looks so well you would certainly try and wake her up  if you knew her name you might say amanda amanda   extracorpus speaker makes a joke, everyone laughs   and this is where liz mentioned the sternal rub which some instructors are fonder of than i am which consists of grinding your knuckles into the sternum   so remember it's a grinding rub   it's using your bony knuckles against someone's bony sternum and it does hurt  it isn't always required  you only do that when you're not getting when a person doesn't look awful and you think they might be sleeping  when people do look awful they may literally be the colour of the carpet and that will be a big clue to you too  this person looks really abnormal this person must have a serious problem  with the adult victim well with any victim you should yell for help  with the adult victim you are supposed to go and get help  now this maybe something new from the time that you learned this technique   and this is based on the fact that the adult victim will be typically collapsed from a heart problem and will benefit from a defibrillator   so this means when you discover that an adult person is collapsed and unconscious then you are supposed to leave the victim or have someone else call an ambulance  because you want a defibrillator there right away okay  all other victims children and babies you follow through with the a b cs  so if i determine that she's unresponsive i've hollered for help liz and i are rescuing her together   one of us can stay and carry on with the a b cs the other one can go and call for help   if she's unconscious lying here i can rearrange her carefully  the way i need to to rescue her  if i see that something is obviously broken then i would proceed with more caution but i'd still have to intervene if she's unconscious  after the u for unresponsiveness what do we have  speaker z answers question   it's airway   speaker z makes a comment   so then you do the head tilt chin lift like this   and then you wush then you would   do b look listen and feel for breathing  and so each one just involves a little technique  and what you should do today is try and perfect these techniques  and as word said if i discover that the victim isn't breathing i will breathe for her   if i can get the air in then i can move through the assessment to see and check the pulse   and if she has a pulse then i'll just to do mouth to mouth because i know she needs mouth to mouth and if she doesn't have a pulse then i'll go to the chest and do c p r   so what i would like to do now is to just have liz  try and rescue amanda just following the a b cs  if everybody could come around here and watch  and then the next person will rescue liz   and then the next person will rescue that person alright  i want to sort of shock you into doing that sort of stuff right away laughs with audience   speaker z starts to speak tape stops and starts again   you will recognize a problem okay then you will assess the problem and then you will respond to the best of your ability   in terms of any legal considerations the only thing you have to know is that both the quebec civil code and the canadian criminal code have articles that put the onus on any bystander to do something when there's an emergency  this means that if your neighbour's house is on fire the law says you're supposed to do something which usually means call for help  if you hear a neighbour beating up a member in the family the law says both for for the dog and for the wife or the child or whatever the law says you should phone somebody  whatever the the extent of your ability is you should respond  loud noise, maybe a door closing   so as long as you never try and do some emergency procedure that you haven't been trained to do there can be no problem  and as long as it will always be provable that you acted in good faith  perhaps you've heard about this legal consideration agreement from audience acting in good faith  so these these are the things you'll have to consider  that you do respond to the extent of your ability and that your response is in good faith  and then you are literally untouchable by any pursuit
