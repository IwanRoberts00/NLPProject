 well four or five words cos at one point in time i used to be able to get up at ten o'clock in the morning and drink a forty by myself and go to work   you'd get up and have a forty of booze for breakfast and go to work  yeah and then i'd go to work  just kin   a guy can't handle himself in alcohol  well then i don't you know rest of utterance  so you're telling me you can drink forty ounces and nothing  at one point in time yeah   kinda kind of knock the cap off and guzzle it down is that what you do  no now you're just being a smart ass  stop that  alright  wouldn't take anything more than two hours anyway   and when you you could drink forty ounces and then function at a job  well there wasn't there wasn't   much of a much work to be done anyway it wasn't much of a job  i mean we'd play around two words  picking garbage up well you gotta got to  think who'd have to be word to do that  a mechanic of some sort  well my father's a word   alright   i understand that you had smoked a joint joint  as well on uh september twenty-seventh  mm hmm   like early earlier in the day  you smoked a joint early in the day  yeah  early than what  what time  before you drank  well no it was after after i drank but it was in the afternoon when when we got rest of utterance  well in the afternoon you and uh mark uhm saw something or were involved in something that upset you is that right  yeah it was just after we left the two words  okay  and uhm you got sucker-punched  yes i did  and you didn't like that a bit i take it  uh no four or five words right underneath the chin   so i take it you didn't like it  well no  alright  utterance   well if you don't mind i'll ask the questions thank you   you phoned your mother  yes i did  and uh you were very emotional at that time  yes i was  told your mother you had a gun  yes i did  told your mother you were gonna going to   shoot the first person that you saw that got in your way  the first person that got in my face   why did you say that  well because well because you know me and five or six words at the time  five or six words you know sucker-punched and what have you  it kinda kind of to de   ugh to add add to the matter you know it wasn't a guy that sucker-punched me so i couldn't exactly hit her you know  it was a girl  okay  i would re i really would  like to you know but i do have some morals  okay  so you were upset at that so you told your mom that you had a gun and you were gonna going to shoot somebody  yep  and from from there you went down to the mall  yeah  and it's there that you smoked a joint  yeah  like in the garage well the parkade because   and from there you went back to the river place   yeah  and you were upset when you got home  i was yeah word cough   and was it still a little bit of word  that you were upset over   did you wanna want to go out and find uh  some trouble  no not really because uh i never like going out looking for trouble because trouble just has a way of finding me   kay okay well that night on september twenty-ninth you uh you have a knife on you  when you came back from the mall back to uh river place   yeah  so you got a knife from the house  yep  and you put gloves on  yep  surgical gloves  yep  and you weren't go you weren't looking for trouble   well like like the whole idea was to go out and uh rob somebody you know rest of utterance  that's not trouble to you  well i don't know at that time it wasn't trouble you know like   trouble is you know two or three words  when people are gonna going to get word  so when you told me that you don't go out lookin   looking for trouble it kinda kind of  finds you  yeah  uh  it follows me  pardon me  it follows me  you were followed  yeah it follows like at a great like four or five words you know they keep sending all my uh  paperwork from the penetentiary you know four or five words  you know it's more of a follower than a leader  that's where i've always been though   well that certainly helps your position doesn't it  well i wouldn't know   so is it your evidence then that when you uh put on was it one pair or two pairs of surgical gloves  it was two pairs per hand   you put the gloves on and and got your knife that uh that you thought you were gonna going to  perhaps go out for a robbery  well just go yeah just go rob somebody yeah  okay   picked the knife off the table did you  yeah  and you describe that as a rambo knife  a rambo-style knife   and you had kind of made a claim on that knife when  stephen brought them over to the house  yes i did  you had carried it before i take it  uhh yes i have  and you kind of all had a a a  usual knife  would that be fair for me to say  uhh well mark you it wasn't a emphasis on " a"  usual knife it was kinda kind of knives  right  but i can't say that we really had any one specific because we could only only word  one day we'd have one the next day you'd have one you know and uh  rest of utterance   you liked that one  yeah cos it's big shiny and heavy  and sharp  well i can't say it was really all that sharp   why's that  well because of the on the  blade that's a saw you know the sharpest thing on the entire thing was the saw part on the back of the knife on the teeth  this uh knife had teeth on it then it wasn't a smooth edge   two or three words back side two or three words wires two or three words what have you  alright so both sides of the uh knife could be used as a  instrument of some sort then  do you follow my question  there's a sharp side and a  and a and a and a rigid side yeah  okay   and bart had a usual knife did he  well he had one that was usual you know like  two or three word final two or three word  earlier  right and that's uh   you're referring to it as a word knife  yeah  and that's the knife that you saw being put uh  in his uh in the leg there  do you know which which foot or which shoe  uhh no i don't  i mean i honestly i don't know   and do you know which knife rick bought that night  it'd be it was at the when the   two or three words   or it was a yellow yellow knife yeah nice and word   what about this one was there another one  yeah  utterance   utterance   does this knife have a this one or two words  does this knife have a sheath  i think it did  and when rick took that knife it was in the sheath   when rick took the knife yeah it had a sheath  and how does a sheath for a knife work  does that go on the on a belt somewhere  well it's just like a like a all sorts of knives are like that okay  it doesn't matter where you put the sheath  you can either wear it in your belt or if it's like your uh if it's like a wristband you can because it don't matter you know   word sometimes have a strap two or three words have a strap you can wrap around your leg  some of them you can wrap around you are spring-loaded and just pop open in your hand  how about this particular knife the the  knife that rick bought whether this is it or not the knife  rick bought  just just you know rest of utterance   how did he do it that night  it was inside his waistband  in the belt loop then  no in the waistband  alright  and how bout about yourself  uh mine was in the front in the waistband like right  right in front  where if i was to sit down it would be quite uncomfortable   you said bart had another knife  yeah  where did that other knife come from  it was also uh one that was brought over by can't remember who  stephen   stephen yeah  and describe that knife  it was it was either   i guess it was quite crystal and two or three words  on the table there like you know like there rest of utterance   like i don't know probably ten nine inches nine or ten inches  and the evidence is that you put that knife in his waistband  yeah  in the sheath  yeah pause about ten seconds   now you gave rick your knife at a short distance from the house  yeah   you hadn't come across anybody as of this time  no because i realized you know five or six words  i have gloves three or four words i don't need a weapon  i never needed a weapon   why did you take a knife in the first place  four or five words you know  i used to carry a knife around with me at all times   utterance   what'd rick do with the knife when you gave it to him  two or three words put it in his waistband as well  so now he had two and you don't have any  cough   certain you didn't give rick that knife  one or two words   yes i did   did rick grab it from you at the scene  nope   now when you get to the tracks you mention that you saw some workers and you uh saw what it turns out to be john   mm hmm   your evidence is that bart approached him first  yes clears throat   did he know what was going down at the time  uhh i forget he was really word on the whole robbery you know he was gonna going to  rob the guy take the guy's wallet you know   little did he know it was gonna going to  it was his life that was being taken  so you watched bart approach this  fella fellow   yeah   and you were i think your evidence is you were twenty yards away  i was in uh well rest of utterance   like from me to you or perhaps a little bit more  i'd have to say three or four words  about three quarters of the way down to the corner  alright  and your evidence is that you saw bart approach the fellow  right   could you hear bart saying anything to him  uhh that time rest of utterance   but i guess you were paying particular attention to what was going on  well yeah  yeah  you were very curious as to what was going on  very  right pause about fifteen seconds   you never seen bart pull the knife  not at that time rest of utterance   he had a knife to uh his throat and he told us that he stabbed him in the foot  right  and you never took your eyes you never took your eyes off him did you from the time you were word  in the ditch until the time you arrived  well i could see where i was to get up you know it wasn't exactly my area i wasn't gonna going to hang around  but you're telling us that when you arrived at uh  where bart and john were that john had already been stabbed in the foot  yeah  and y you didn't see this  no  no   did you see any blood  hmm   no i you you wouldn't normally see blood when four or five words in the shoes you know  personal experience   you've been stabbed in the foot before have you  well no it's just that uh you know i've stepped on a large uh spike you know word spike four or five words  and a large nail and you don't you don't see much   you don't see any blood through the top of the shoe  alright   and when you got there you say that bart was uh  around john's head area  yes  were they on the ground  uhh after after they uh  cut maybe they three or four words yes they were on the ground  when you arrived there were they on the ground  yes   and you watched bart push him down  yes  so he pushed him down before you arrived there  yes  once again you never saw the knife to the foot  didja did you   no i rest of utterance   so your evidence is then that bart had a knife  to the fella fellow and he stopped to tell you he stabbed him the foot  yeah pause about 15 seconds   and what is rick doing at this time  rick was pretty much right on top of john  like really right on top you know sort of  so like on the chest you mean  like in the chest area yeah
