of local hockey and you know uhm  university hockey and stuff and that's i guess where a lot of the priority is  but you'd still think  like i they seem to be desperately trying to get a new team in from what i've heard  mhh hmm   so i mean why bother  i mean you lost your old team  why didn't you just you know put more effort into keeping your old team   i don't know the answer to that question

not my taste  i word   it's not comfortable  ya well it's leather that's why   ya it's like you get all sticky sitting in it  i know it's a gorgeous sofa and everything but   i'd love their blue one  i was hoping the'd give it to us  well all the kids use it downstairs   ahh that thing i could sleep in   ya  maybe two words my favourite sofa when we bought that living downtown  and your parents  your father didn't seem uhm distant tonight  do you know what i mean  ya he was a good sport  ya   i was surprised   cough cough   it went a little  i don't know if they were being polite cos they
