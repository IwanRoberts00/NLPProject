 it wasn't a big deal  hmm  uhm when i was in grade one we had we all had to go to the high school  this is quite a traumatic event  we all had to go to the high school to see a film and i had never seen television before  and the film was on a huge screen  how old were you   grade one  we were six years old  wow   and it showed some children on a train track and the train came and then it just showed their lunch cans or whatever as if they  were squished   eww   and it was just i was traumatized  by that and i had dreams about it and still i'm it has   it still affects me   this movie they showed us laugh in grade one  ohh   now that was to keep us away from the train tracks  it was really tempting to go  cos you'd have to wait sometimes  they i think they they   made a law or something that they couldn't block a  a crossway for for you know more than twenty or something like that after a while  be but when i was a kid you could wait for it seemed like an hour  and we were on the wrong side of the tracks from the uhm from the fire trucks and the ambulances and everything  like that they were all over here  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so actually the property values were less on that side of the tracks  wow  because the wardass tracks went right across and ah the big freight trains would cut off the north side of the city completely  from from   mhh hmm   then you'd wait and wait and wait and wait  and it was really tempting to just like  the the thing that links them is only this big  i can just hop over that  mhh   take me one second  but then there was that boy with the one arm and one leg laugh   mhh   you didn't want to do it  mhh hmm  so but now you know hardly any trains at all  mhh hmm  i sorta sort of miss it  it was n nice   kinda kind of living in deauville cos the train was right there   you could hear it   i could hear it  ya it was fond memories of back home  mhh hmm  must have been i don't really remember the steam trains although there were some when i was really little i think  i'm not sure but  i don't either  my father talks about them and  about the boiler and filling up the boiler and tense moments  phrase   ya   mhh   but i don't  we had television ever since i was born  i don't know why  i think my uncle bought it  like i was born in fifty-one   we had a television and i remember one day there was a woman screaming on the television and i must have been three years old and my mother said that's it  laugh   cos the three little kids were sitting there watching this  laugh   laugh   out went the television onto the front lawn with a sign  television for sale   laugh   and we never saw it again   i remem remember   i remember watching the coronation in fifty-three  yes  i do  i do  i really do  i don't know if i really do or i i  just think i do but laugh i i  really like ya i rea really   you're word vision   sometimes you sort of review your memories  and i know i think i knew  even then that it was significant  and that it was exciting and everything  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i remember that and ajax the foaming cleanser ads  laugh   i remember climbing down from the supper table so i could go in and watch  laugh   ajax the foaming cleanser singing   laugh   oh we didn't get any steady diet of television at all  the only time we saw it was in the summer if we went to visit our grandmother  hmm  other than that   so did you mostly play with each other or did you have lots of friends around  no each other  my brother had two friends that lived  they were called the lloyd boys  there last name was lloyd and they were just a year apart  he used to play with them and they one time went down to the river  and they cut the boon that held the logs  a boon is a uhm it's just a rope   of logs held together in order to hold all the logs in  mhh   they cut it and out flowed all irving's j.d. irving ltd.  logs down the river  the police came to our house to investigate how this rope had been cut and they all said they hadn't done it  and then  they were about twelve years old  then one of them said that the other one had done it so they each said the other one had done it   laugh   and then the police took them in their car  and i remember being terrified  he was six years older than me  ohh  and i asked my father where they had taken him and he said oh to jail just as casually   laugh   cos i think he was uhm he was   thinking it was good for the boys to get this lesson right  so he just says it casually but for me it was terrifying that he would go to jail and never come back  ohh i see  but uh i think they just received a slap on the wrist as if you know don't you do that again  my brother burned a barn down when he was about that age  ya the guys almost burnt down a house  my si sister   my little sister was with him  mhh hmm   and i think he couldn't get it out so he came home  i don't know what the whole story is but it burned down  right down   see my father was very concerned about that always  about fires  because something had happened to him in his childhood  ohh  so uhm   was uh was everyone home when your house burned down  did you guys ever unclear word    no we had all gone to visit my grandmother   in woodstock  but your brother got out alright   uh no one was home   so he brought these oil lamp not 'lamps' in and  no it was just a lightbulb uh hanging from the bunkbed   and we had left for the day and so this bulb  was burning into the matress and  gradually   oh i thought   oh i see oh   oh i thought you said an oil lamp  it was filling up  no   oh  ya it was just a   oh jeez   yup  so someone called us and said that the house was burning  and then when we got home yes it was quite black but it was still standing  all the neighbours had come over and dumped things out the window  they all had a fine time laugh i think  laugh   jee   ex excitement   some excitement in chipman   laugh   i remember the day that uh my brother brought home two hippies that were travelling through  laugh   they had come from b c british columbia on their harley-davidson and wanted to hitchhike back just for some excitement  and so they my my   brother crated their uh   we should pull out the recipe right   cos we're doing two cups of rice     phrase   okay  should i peel the cucumber  i think so  ya  i think for sushi ya  and like cut it in strips   and so someone has to fan and someone has to stir  okay  i'll stir and you can pour  can pour this in  pour that in  ya  okay  but do we  wait ya you pour this in  that's what we did   we need three people  you pour it in  it doesn't tell you to steam in that  but we'll pour this in after this is in  mix it  wh and then mix it well  if i understand english   and mix it  the rice first  where's our wait where's our   big wooden spoon  ya  it's 15 seconds of background noise   so pour all the rice in  well two cups   oh only two cups of rice  only two cups of rice  oh no  should we do it all maybe  ya it says two cups  oh no it doesn't  it says two cups of dry rice  two cups of  why don't we just do up all the rice and then  ya it says two cups   cook two cups as package makes about five cups so ya  okay that's about right   there's only about a cup and a quarter of dry rice  oh  oh okay  well i'll just put in that much  that's a lot of rice  so i'll pour this over  words   words rice  ya   are we on  ya it's going  okay  this stuff is <down to the bottom of  damn  what should i do about this   all the stuff here  take a teaspoon  ya i'm just gonna going to   ya 17 seconds, cooking background noises   until it's room temputurature  it's <-gotta has got to be found   uh it well ya that's what it said in the lost kitchen   i think his parents word   you think these are thin enough or should i cut 'em  them one more time  i think you should cut 'em them  one more time  you think so  ya   eww we have to cut the fish  that should be pretty weird  oh the fish and the avocado  mhh   it's like the prettiest food has to wait   mhh  isn't it   that is   it's really  so they didn't have any other raw fish tam   they had lots of raw fish but the man there said it not like the what he said the white fish probably wouldn't be good  and they didn't have tuna   what else could you use for sushi  squid octopus  ya we could've gotten really exotic   i hope this is  it's okay  but does it have to be stirred until it's room  temperature   i don't know loud banging starts   i think words   i just words     you read about this stuff banging stops   do you want me to try for awhile  are you bored  no i can do this  you wanna want to cut the pepper   or   sure   cut the pepa pepper   where's my line   i think i need a cigarette laugh   i'm sure word one person's supposed to turn it right  well that's what  oh it's supposed to be turn   it's like turn and fan   turn and fan at the same time  you didn't find that wooden spoon  oh it's there  ya it's in the sink   is it in the sink   i can turn and fan at the same time  do you have like a sushi woon  wooden spoon spoon like an actual sushi spoon     hmm     something like that drawer rattling starts for 20 seconds       hmm rattling stops,   have you noticed that it seems to be  you know the one i'm talking about  it's like this ah this high  words   oh that one   and it's really good to spread with eh  yes   you haven't seen it eh   yes but i know we've got it  i haven't seen it in a couple of weeks because i've looked for it  you know i wonder if we used it camping   i think i remember using it camping  no really  ya  did we forget it there  well it may be in here in the kitchen     cough     so   this rice looks like very strange  it does  it's sticky right  is that whatcha what you mean  ya  it's sticky rice  i hope it works   so some are going to be completely vegetarian and the other ones are going to be meat  or are we going to mix the the  vegetables and the tuna  i think we should  or mix maybe avocado  no just   i think i think we should like each  wait  we could we could we've got ten noris right   so we can do like some vegetarian some   i would like some with like vegetables and salmon but no avocado  okay   i know that's specific but i don't really want any avocado  oh salmon  i think it was tuna  ya it's salmon  just salmon  okay   so i turn it like over  mhh hmm   fan it   are you supposed to really go for it with the fanning  cos you kind of need two people do it
