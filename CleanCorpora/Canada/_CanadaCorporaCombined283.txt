 it's been almost a decade since the brundtland commission made its report in nineteen eighty-seven  critics are beginning to wonder when all the talk will become action on the ground  fred mcsweeny is with the pembina institute for appropriate development in drayton valley  speech, 2 min 5 sec   jim bauer of alberta environmental protection is now involved with a government review of the recommendations of the taskforce  the taskforce recommended some fairly progressive ideas such as the use of full-cost accounting a review of fees and taxes for their effect on sustainable development and that alberta's system of protected areas be completed  speech, 10 sec   as is the case with things economic the federal government is creating an independent auditor of sustainable development  in alberta however there is no formal monitoring of our progress on sustainable development  the alberta roundtable did come up with fifty-nine indicators for measuring sustainable development but most of these indicators are not being used in the government's annual report  the majority of indicators are still traditional measures of economic performance such as g d p jobs and the cost of transportation  but that's only half of the sustainable development equation  what's missing are indicators that would raise red flags signalling threats to the environment  i asked fred mcsweeny if there are indicators that could help balance off the economic ones already in place  speech, 1 min 15 sec   there's a flurry of sustainable development activity going on inside government but it's hard to see results on the ground  this radio series was inspired by the alberta roundtable report  throughout this series we will assess alberta's progress on the fifty-nine indicators of sustainable development identified by the roundtable  that's it for our feature report   technology may not hold all the answers to creating a sustainable future but according to tim lee at a g t limited the creation of fibre optics has radically improved the efficiency of telecommunications  fibre optic wires are made out of plain everyday sand  not only is the process of mining sand far cleaner than mining copper the wires are one thousand times more efficient  this means one pair of fibre optic wires can handle thirty thousand telephone calls at once compared to just twenty-four on a pair of old-fashioned copper wires  when it comes to alberta's wetlands the story is not quite so positive  according to alberta environmental protection the number of marshlands in alberta declined by more than thirty percent between nineteen seventy and nineteen ninety  to try and save wetlands the north american waterfowl management plan was created and the alberta government is also creating a wetland policy for alberta   time will tell if the trend can be reversed   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   alberta's economy runs on natural resources  from the oil and gas industry to the coal-fired power plants that provide our electricity alberta's dependent on its natural resources  agriculture forestry and tourism round off a suite of renewable natural resources that albertans depend on  how does a province of oil barons loggers miners and farmers deal with some very real global environmental problems  today we asked ty lund alberta's minister of the environment what alberta's doing to create a sustainable future  in alberta perhaps unlike anywhere else in canada people are reminded of their dependence on natural resources every two weeks when they collect their paycheques  most jobs in alberta are linked in some way to the exploitation of natural resources  oil and gas still make up a majority of provincial revenues  ty lund knows this well  he's the minister of the environment and a two-term conservative m l a member of the legislative assembly from rocky mountain house  i asked ty lund what he thinks the big sustainable development issues are for alberta  speech, 15 sec   lund's concerns about greenhouse gas emissions is tempered however by his concern that alberta might lose oil and gas business  in fact he says if alberta reduced production of natural gas it might be bad for the environment because those markets would still be filled by other countries with lower environmental standards  speech, 2 min interview between a and z, 1 min 40 sec   the government's annual report is chock full of economic indicators such as the amount of grain produced timber harvested or the low prices alberta charges for utilities and trucking but rarely does it look at the quality and sustainability of the ecological systems that produce the resources  the report of the alberta roundtable endorsed by the alberta government in nineteen ninety-three states there are consumption limits to the earth's resources and that the increasing rate of consumption and the exploding world population are the largest contributors to the global environmental crisis  i asked ty lund if he believes there are limits to consumption  speech, 20 sec   some scientists say we're already running a global environmental deficit but the division between those who think vigorous economic growth can save us and those who think reduced consumption can save us is the grand canyon of voids  in march nineteen ninety-five the ensuring prosperity taskforce made twenty-four recommendations to change our ways  among many suggestions it proposed the injection of sustainable development into the school curriculum and the creation of a mechanism to coordinate and implement sustainable development  i asked mister lund if all of the recommendations are being implemented  speech, 20 sec   many critics see monitoring and reporting on sustainable development progress as the achilles heel of sustainable development  they say that without transparent and independent monitoring it will be too easy to cook the books  if sustainable development is as important as the government says it is critics wonder why no one is in charge of it  the federal government is creating an independent environmental auditor like the auditor general  i asked mister lund if he's developing a similar process here  speech, 30 sec   another suggestion of the taskforce was a review of taxes and fees for their impact on sustainable development  in sweden the government there has recently reduced income tax by four percent and replaced it with environmental taxes on s o two and c o two gases related to acid deposition and global warming  speech, 15 sec   for reaction to ty lund's ideas about sustainable development we contacted ryan polansky   he was a member of the alberta roundtable on the environment and economy  speech, 55 sec   in a natural resource dependent province like alberta sustainable development may be one of the most challenging issues we will face in coming years  next week we begin our exploration of the alberta roundtable's fifty-nine indicators of sustainable development  that's it for our feature report  you're listening to the chevron ecofile   preserving biodiversity is a key element of sustainable development but have you ever wondered how many species of life there are in canada  according to ted mosquin don mcallister and peter whiting the authors of a new book on canada's biodiversity there are seventy-one thousand species of life in canada   but those are only the discovered species  the scientists estimate there are sixty-eight thousand more species not yet discovered by science and for each species of life there is at least one more species of virus  if you're keeping tabs the answer is there are two hundred eighty thousand species of life in canada   when you factor environmental costs into things the results can be surprising  according to the world watch institute burning a gallon of gasoline in the u s costs the driver about one dollar twenty cents but it can cost the country another three dollars in medical bills and property damage from smog and other side effects   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   it's nine a m on a hot summer day  the morning rush hour is over and there's a yellow brownish haze hanging over the city  todd matlock is an air quality analyst with alberta environmental protection  speech, 1 min 5 sec   if that day were a fall day and there was a strong temperature inversion you might be experiencing one of alberta's rare poor air quality days  today we'll try to find out whether air quality is getting better or worse in alberta   according to jimmy siegel of alberta's air monitoring branch urban air quality is improving in alberta  speech, 20 sec interview between a and za, 20 sec   alberta's air quality index reports on the status of five major pollutants carbon monoxide dust and smoke nitrogen dioxide ozone and sulphur dioxide  the air quality index rates air quality in seven cities and towns as good fair poor or very poor  jimmy siegel is with alberta's air monitoring branch  speech, 20 sec   you can find out the current air quality index by calling  four one seven seven one seven nine in edmonton and two five seven two seven one one in calgary  the picture painted by alberta's air monitoring branch is actually quite rosy  dozens of slick brochures itemize dramatic improvements in a number of areas  but according to deborah kostiuk an environmentalist from rocky mountain house there are some problems  kostiuk worries that carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions are rising and that monitoring in rural alberta is inadequate  she's also worried about high ground level ozone levels in rural areas and the emerging issue of acid aerosols pollutants that form when acids in the air combine with fine particulates  in nineteen ninety the government released the clean air strategy for alberta  it presented a comprehensive new blueprint for air quality management in alberta  soon after the clean air strategic alliance or casa was formed  it's up to casa to implement the clean air strategy  tim feely is the executive director of casa  speech, 1 min 55 sec   one of the first airshed groups to form was the west central airshed society  tom wilfred of weldwood canada in hinton is the group's chair  speech, 20 sec   in the early nineteen eighties the unmistakable odour of poisonous sour gas poured over the region when the lodgepole sour gas well blew  after that experience residents wanted better air quality monitoring   the airshed covers an area that runs from the berland river in the north along the alberta b c border to a line north of rocky mountain house and east almost as far as wabamun lake  the monitoring will cost seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and will include biological monitoring sites where alfalfa saskatoons and even forests will be monitored for the effects of air pollution  speech, 25 sec   some fifty companies now contribute to the airshed agency and  wilfred says this should mean better monitoring and higher public credibility  speech, 40 sec   since funding is provided on a polluter-pay basis it may be possible for industry to reduce its levy  speech, 20 sec   the clean air strategic alliance is working to get other regional airshed groups started as well  that's it for our feature report  next week we'll zero in on one of the most troubling pollutants of all  one observer told us he hasn't seen a mobilization of industry around an issue like this since love canal  you can't see it or smell it but increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide could change the world you live in  we'll find out what alberta's doing about global warming next week  alberta is one of the leading producers of sulphur dioxide pollution in canada  sulphur dioxide is a key cause of acid rain or acid deposition  second only to ontario alberta produces six hundred forty thousand tonnes of s o two each year  most of the s o two pollution comes from natural gas processing the tar sands and power plants   because of prevailing winds about seventy percent of alberta's s o two pollution is exported to other places like saskatchewan the northwest territories and ontario   according to one estimate alberta is responsible for nine percent of the acid deposition in northern ontario   on the good news side of things some air quality trends in edmonton and calgary are positive  thanks to improving car technology carbon monoxide pollution is down by more than fifty percent since nineteen eighty and the use of unleaded gasoline has helped reduce lead pollution by ninety-six percent over the same period of time   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   on one of those spring days when the thermometer drops below minus twenty degrees celsius it's just plain hard to take global warming seriously but according to researchers at the national climatic data center in ashville new york you should  they say there's as much as a ninety-five percent chance that increasing weather extremes are being caused by greenhouse gases
