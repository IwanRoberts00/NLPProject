 they're not going to be able to find it unless  they have a great job  no   so i'm word we'll have word  back too  i think perhaps thinking of moving out of the house and into an apartment's a bit premature  perhaps   well we talked about that last night too  and morris said we and word said   well their children are gone  ya but you see they're in that words    somebody said to me yesterday gone as in university or gone as in forever   laugh that's true   and i said gone as in university and she says ya well don't hold your breath  that's true   you know   so i was speaking to uhm cough i don't know what her name is but she is ah she was having a kind of   word of word fair trade in uhm   word   steve hammond   steve hammond used to be positional chief of the children's and he is no longer positional chief  because i think there have been two since he/-> since he   was he had that  word   right   oh i know who  and then there right up at the top at personnel i guess words   right she's gone   ya she's gone and she's   yes she's always at the pool  oh okay you well you know she spoke to me yesterday on the fruit bar and she said uh you know are you still swimming and ah in the  word machine and i said no actually that i  hadn't hadn't been sitting in it for four years   and and then she said well i know who you are because she said i pass you in the street all the time my name is  i don't know what her first name you know  i can't remember  word or dorothy or  something  mhhm   and we had the nicest talk words   words   she's very chatty   word in and out of the  store and uh we went from sort of swimming to uhm uh country  capital to children and uhm i don't know i even thought of that time word about any difficulties in life   just really sort of about word minutes but it was always spontaneous and natural and uhm word  she left i said thank you so much for stopping me  mhhm   mhhm  you know i probably walked by her all the time and never looked at her  i would i wouldn't even  i wouldn't have even known her before   well she recognized me because her daughter was a patient up on the seventh floor  where word and i work  oh  and i would walk by in the hallway and i'd really you know  her face was familiar but i would never look at her and think where   d do i know this person from   yes you might have thought she just worked in the hospital  and then we're at the pool i don't know how she started to talk to me   interesting  i remember it was really nice  mhhm  but she's the one who said to me i said oh well   we were talking about me going back to work and how uh i liked it uh i liked it but that i found returning to work after twenty years as an adjustment itself   mhhm mhhm   to say nothing of the fact of uhm adjusting to a profession where there was just uhm so much work to be done at home  right   you know it wasn't just go it wasn't just going out and doing something else which in itself would be fun but but it it  words   words at home  mhhm ya it takes up an awful lot of time and uh she  said asked me how long the hiatus had been and i said eighteen or twenty years and she said she went back after fifteen years and she found it difficult too  mhhm   and then i said i'll talk with word as sort of suffering from empty-nest which kevin believes  and she said oh god she said i had five children i couldn't wait for them to go  laugh   but she said words she said we had one child who we're still having trouble but she didn't elaborate   and i didn't ask and uh she just sort of gave me that headache look  and uh uhm and she just uh anyway it was it was just sort of along those lines but uhh  no   mhhm   she never bought a place up at sardona  oh really  she said she and heath bought a log cabin uhh i don't know how many years ago she said  i thought it was heath's word   no i think it was carrie   maybe it was the two of them  she said we're building our own log cabin  oh of course that just i just like the sound of that   it's an oasis  ya  words were saying last night that  word place in the khyber's place is a home  yes   it's a place that you could retire to  because it's it's like a home  uhh ya   and our place is really a country place  but is that why you say you don't you can't  see yourself re retiring   at there because uhm the house itself   it's the house itself  it's adorable and cozy but there's no breathing  space   ya   ya   i know   it's it's a short term  okay  but if you have a s if you had ah ah if it was a bigger place could you see yourself living in the country full time   no  no you see that's words   word   that no  there's not nothing to keep me here  i'm not a gardener eight hours a day  i can't leave everyday of my life  no  uhm words work   to work from there to work from there it would be difficult i think cos you're kind of in the middle of nowhere  i'd have to go to st-jovite so   well that wouldn't be too bad  no  actually that wouldn't be too bad would it  words word  see up there  do you do you know the sopranos   well i know him  they they're moving  they're moving up north permanently  really words   words   they're making the move  ste-anne-du-lac  oh really  well maniwak really  they're making the word   words or something  what   you know that's the benefit to him in the community because they probably don't have any opthamologists  no they probably don't  i don't know whenever i go up there i think oh gosh i'd love to live here permanently but i think at the time i'm in the i'm in sort of a frame of mind where i falsely imagine that my day to day life would be as it is on the weekends which is sort of full of projects and uhmm uh i don't know full of projects that i enjoy doing  word   but of course once you move your day to day life into the place where you usually holiday it takes on a different uh   it's a different landscape so word   exactly in fact jack ah jimmy's  brother who's retired took a little retirement and and  thought that he would love it  and he carves ducks and he and he said you know i used to carve ducks when i was stressed at work and i'd come home and words or if i felt like doing it  mhhm   mhhm  i don't want to spend my life carving ducks  laugh i know  so he ya he's going through a big adjustment now  well i think you know i think   that hobbies aren't enough to keep you you you  dream about having time to do that or things that you'd like to do  but uh i think being off work this term is uhm   has really has really shown me   that first hand is that despite the fact that i was so busy stressed and and uhm very stressed probably more stressed then i needed to be but uhm without it i didn't have the same sense of fulfillment at all  mhhm   no  nor did i  but see i could see myself getting more involved in my career  but right now i can't because of my words   word and my children   i know   do you ever do you ever think of how nice it would be uhm to not have all these other commitments  or not necessarily how nice it would be i e word    words   i'm curious to see how far you might take  your career  right   just to see how far you might get given the  given the uh conditions that would allow you the freedom   to focus words   to do to prove that  words   yes well i remember when the children were babies and i used to think as soon as they're go to school i will do this  now it just gets bigger and bigger words  and i'm totally committed to them right now  my passion is them and not my career  it happens words   and you know what will happen i may never have the career that i thought i would   no   the minute you words off  words   words   you might have it for a few years  maybe  if sam is not still living at home if he is really out of town i could probably give it  words but because   morris' profession is such that  he is never at home either so i don't really  mhhm   cough   mhhm   no it's like raymond's hours are similar  i could never get into it   and i may just also feel like that because i realize that there are so many different things i'd like to explore  but i don't want to explore them at the expense of my   family   no   and what was suddenly family time in terms of like the fireplace and well i just mean in terms of family commitments where if my head is on something that pertains to family  that's the ch and you know my head is also on school and one has to take first place there's not question  no   there's not question  there's not question  there's not question words   so of course it all hinges on my  feeling to say yes to everything  and and to have the total amount of energy that you want for your career it drains you for your family i'm  oh ya ya   there's a young word i talked to you about her before and she has three children and she is a researcher and she's amazing and she's doing her master's and she does her   she's only taking two or three courses at a time but you know  she's she's young she's   that is unbelievable  three children works full-time and taking her master's  but she lives but she lives in lussier and her husband's a policeman who works who works crazy hours  mhhm  and she was telling me the evening nurses about the problems sh  she her son is having at school and uhh   she's she's fighting with her professor and she's thinking of quitting school and i think the writing's on the wall for that woman  come on   her son who's who's had problems before obviously and all of her children are younger than madie   i mean her eldest is younger than madie   not like he's thirteen   oh ya  that's the tough part   words it's a   it's a tough thing   mhhm  the life of a grad word   ya  we're all looking for that purpose that thing in   in life that's going to fulfill us  and uhm i think we're all guilty of going off in the wrong on the wrong tangent trying find out  whereas basically it's just sleep with with  sleep with as many people as you can  ya   but but remember that little thing i had on ahh on my bed  uhm i don't know any remedy  i don't know that i can uhm what i would  word ahh   i cannot give you the formula for success but i can give you the formula for failure you can't please everybody   exactly  you know and ah   and another thing too with all the cutbacks since i don't know if i told you this i told louise  at work with all the cutbacks and people maybe working four days instead of five or three days instead of four or five that we could ehm ehm get back to basics and give back to the community uhh get involved  right
