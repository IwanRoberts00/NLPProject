 so that that could vary from cegep to cegep the learning activities for the cours propre the block b  then each cegep can decide how far it's going to apply what is  said in here as chalk sound starts and stops   word uhh un programme ou un groupe de programme   theoretically a cegep could say we're putting all the programs in one family  that's the way we deal with it   okay   uh i've heard of one cegep i think is doing that a small cegep  theoretically a cegep could say we have twenty families we are going to have twenty s block b courses and get this at four different levels a course   theoretically it could be that  obviously you would need a cegep of something like probably fifty thousand students to make it really work out  uhh so the c cegep   every cegep is stuck with the problem of okay how do we make it word   a it has to be manageable  you can't end up with having six and seven students in various groups  uh it will depend on the different programs in in  cegeps  some cegeps may have six programs  other cegeps   we have somewhere around twenty  uhh our problem is double because we have two campuses and the same programs are not on the same campuses always  uhm plus you have programs that have heard hey gee we're going to get an english course just for us  and then you have to say well i'm sorry there's not a program just for you  we're going to put you with somebody else  then you have to decide who goes with whom  uh not an easy task  uhm some cegeps uh one cegep for example has gone the route of we will make two families one family is pre-university one family is technical  that's it   okay  it can be as limited as that or as limited as  as nothing i suppose  and they said okay we have enough students we can make two families in each of the levels  so they have eight different courses   a problem is when you talk to your colleagues uh every cegep has a different code for that course  the only possible way of talking about something in common is what we do is refer to as b zero b one b two b three  and if i say b cordia b two level  to a colleague they know exactly what i'm talking about  but if i said oh it's the uhh we have   three courses we've got a d w c and d x e and a d x d all at that level  it would mean nothing  cos the first two letters identify the cegep   so i don't know what the codes are in montreal but ours is d x and d w  other cegeps could be t r and t s and b d and b f and who knows what  so if if you want to compare apples and apples the only way is really to talk about b zero one two three  lengthy question/answer exchange with multiple extra-corpus speakers   another example is office management technology  at our place they used to do three courses uhh one of them   being was called three oh eight a business english course  uhh the when we first started talking they decided okay we'll we've got these two courses and we'll keep the other three that'll make five  they need lots of english   uh then i suggested well why don't we give them a whole semester in english  that would really help them although that's not manageable  uh and then because office management technology programs in cegeps are shrinking because it might end up back at secondary uhh  they decided that one of the reasons possibly is that they decided to move some of the english courses out so they could put more office management technology courses in which in a way makes makes sense uh made sense   so the r end result was there used to be three courses there are still three courses they're just a little different  so the students in office management technology at our place now do  this this plus the three oh eight  so it boils down to the same thing  but they could have decided to keep the other three and add the two  new courses  but again it's a local decision  it's up to the department involved to uh to  make a proposal and then the cegep to decide  and each department understandably is sort of jealous of what's happening because if they  for example in computer science if they keep the three seventeen that means there's a computer science course they can give whereas if they sort of oust the three seventeen then they can put in another computer science course  so it's ah a bit of politicking in some cases question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   i've heard of one cegep where they're looking at five different families  i'm not sure they're going to manage it  uhm anyhow  what's happened what we've suggested at our cegep is that at this level since it's so basic it really doesn't make a lot of sense to go into anything very specific and we would simply keep one family here  and because of the clientele of of not a great deal of students are at this level we are keeping one family here but certain of the assignments that the students will be given they will do based on the program they are in  if one of the themes is the environment well then they will deal with the environment based on if they're in mechanical engineering or  nursing or whatever they're in  uh there's also an element in this b three course uh where  the families is uh the families are sorry uhh where they have  to translate  so the text it may it may   turn out that the text they end up translating from  english to french or french to english whichever way they're going   would be texts that they take on their own text books  or something like that  so we feel that at this level without making separate families because we don't have enough students we could still adapt it through what they're doing in course  this level we felt uh was too weak  and we suggested two families at this level to start with simply pre-university and technical  uh we did a survey of the departments uhm asking them what they thought their students needed to do when they left cegep sort of based on the four skills do they have to be able to read or write or listen or talk  uhm and compiled  i was going to say tried to compile  it's not we just tried  we did compile it  it wasn't easy   uhm and came up in fact with two families in the technical side of it  so the pre-university at our place we have uhh science de la nature science du word langues communication   who are all in one family together  in fact they may not see each other because uh   because i'll explain why in a second  on the technical side uh there is one group which is uh civil engineering mechanical engineering electrical engineering uhm industrial engineering computer science and geomatters uhh partially because it made sense and and in computer science's case they said that's where they wanted to be  so fine that gang is going to be together and they will get a course quote unquote adapted to what they're after  and then sort of what's left over goes together  it doesn't make a lot of sense in all cases but it happens to be  metiers d'art which are people who are going to be jewellers and sculptors and uh i don't know what lutherie  is in english  i've never looked it up  it's people who string violins and things like that  anyhow those people all those metiers d'art   uhh sois infermier uhh   word h&circumflex;telier uhh  technique illustratif et technique de word au bureau  are going to make one happy little family   the only fine thread that joins those people is they all have to manage something whether it be office workers or patients or pieces of wood or customers  because the people in metiers d'art are going to end up as self-employed people uh in the uh in that field  so that's how our family came up  so that we work with next sem  semester next year and uh we'll see how it works out and die in the trying or come out successful  uh the other problem that complicates all this so there are four there are four levels so you've got   you've got to get families together then you gotta   have got to decide how many levels will you have and the other complication is that there are chalk sound starts in the general program four semesters in the technical program six semesters  chalk sound stops uhh and it could be in our sem  semester in our case it could be in any of those semesters  for example students in uhh human science could have chalk sound starts the first course there and the second one chalk sound stops there and students in civil engineering could have chalk sound starts their first course here and the second chalk sound stops  one there and the people in nursing chalk sound starts have their first course here and the second chalk sound stops one there  uh this also creates a bit of a headache  uhh question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   uh a coup couple   one cegep garneau in quebec city made the decision the only way to really manage this is to put it right at the beginning  s and it ma makes   it it makes a certain amount of sense  although there are other repercussions that are really not good for students but anyhow  so garneau has put the cours word   in first semester for everybody and the cours propre  second semester for everybody  it's much easier to manage  uh it means that students have to do their comp   their elective courses in only in   second year things like that  uh but that that's what their decision was  that was their route  uh our cegep went through every program and looked at the program and some programs said there's no way they can do the course the english courses in the first or second semesters they're much too busy getting in the program so put it later  for example in in nursing it's  in seme semester in the third and fourth semesters   okay  or some people said our students are traditionally weak in english we would like it in two and four because we know a gang is going to fail in the second semester they can make it up in the third semester so they won't be h be behind in the fourth semester  so but there's all sorts of considerations  uhm at our place we're   every cegep i would think had to teach all of these courses as of the fall   uhh garneau is teaching all of these started as of january  uh we're teaching four courses in the block b to the students who are in the general side   the students in communications and languages at our cegep have other english courses to do in in the third and fourth semesters so they had to do it in one and two  uh so that's what we're in to at the moment  and it's it's this fall where  the the other gang is coming that's playing on people's nerves to put it mildly   uh what else   so locally the cegeps can decide how many families  locally the cegeps decide what the learning activities are in block b  uh locally cegeps decide where the english courses go  and locally cegeps can decide uhh if there are cours de formation sp&eacute;cifique in the given program  at at our place the ones that i think that are left are in languages in communications in uhh office management technology and two new programs coming in hotel management and  food services and restaurant technology  so it's all put together   okay   question   maybe a bit of a a few words about the philosophy of of this approach which has been  applauded by some and shot down and screamed at by others  uh and unfortunately the ministry has not done a very good marketing job of its of its new approach  uhh well it hasn't done any marketing job
