 thank you my lord uh   if i may   well i have could be 'had' a actually i'll do this first i think  uh in response to the crown and the crown's position and if i may i'd like to suggest that if i listen to the crown's theory and the crown's position on this quite frankly my lord it is indeed a tale well told but a tale nonetheless  and there's some fundamental problems that   i'm not gonna going to take much of your time  i'm gonna going to take about fifteen minutes of the time in responding because i i made a great number of notes and i wanted to be sure that i totally understood  the position of the matter  i think i do  and i know that of course that we're gonna  going to overlook all the hyperboles  the law and word springfield and the  second and cash related word aren't particularly important to us   which is more that what the evidence has told us  there's one fatal flaw my lord in the crown's whole theory and it's this  it's that the crown says that they're not relying on one overall  progenous plan in effect  but as i listen could be 'listened' to my friend very able submission very articulate submission  there's absolutely no doubt that this is one overall progenous  plan  and the problem though is is as follows  there are seven or eight as you will've noticed significant time points on the time chronology that mr kent has forward for you  at each of those times there comes a point where mr luthor   such as tools for breaking into a house   or they may act as a lookout ready to warn the others of the approach   or they may assist the principal offender by being there  and helping them in when they are committing the offence   you therefore must decide whether the act of matthew  aided either roger or peter in the extent of assistance helping facilitating or making it easier for either  roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault   you can find that matthew 's conduct aided either  roger or peter even if either roger and  peter could've committed the offence without his act  it is sufficient that matthew 's conduct assisted  facilitated or made it easier for the offence to be offended    now i'm just gonna going to very briefly touch on the evidence which you must consider word  whether or not the crown has proved that matthew did something  and that act aided roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault  and you first of all word i mentioned earlier you have to consider his evidence he denied the count  if you accept that evidence or you have a reasonable doubt then he has to be acquitted including five or six words   one of them convicted   but the evidence of the crown is sarah said that the accused matthew came into the bedroom and on one occasion  pulled her legs apart  she said that once   but in cross-examination she said she thought it was  matthew   on another occasion she said he tried to grab my legs  and pull them apart but i wouldn't let him   so you have slightly different versions going through all that evidence  and of course you have matthew 's evidence where he denies that that happened   i should also emphasize that both aiding means more than just standing by and watching someone commit an offence   mere presence at the scene of an offence is not sufficient to make a person an aider  an onlooker is not an aider unless he or she actually encourages  or does something to help criminal offence  therefore in order to prove the second element the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that matthew did something and that act actually aided roger and peter to commit  or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault  the third element the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that matthew intended to aid roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault   now in this case there is evidence word   that either roger or peter personally committed the offence of sexual assault   now you might be satisfied insofar as matthew is concerned  that first of all that either   i want to emphasize this that either roger or  peter committed the offence and that matthew  assisted   for either then you must convict both of them  they are equally guilty regardless of which one was the actual perpetrator and which one was the aider or abetter  but again i wanna want to emphasize that if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that matthew  aided either of these two accused as i have defined it for you then you must find not guilty  now ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is a very serious charge and you have very solemn duties and responsibilities  you have a duty to the crown and you have a duty to all  five or six words   you have taken an oath to try the charge on the evidence without  either fear or favour and surrender a true verdict   two or three words you will have performed your duties fully  now in closing i want to leave this message with you  you've heard me say this over and over again and i'll mention it one last time  that every ingredient necessary to sustain the charge against each of the accused must be proved by the crown beyond a reasonable doubt   with respect to each ingredient every ingredient there's no obligation on the accused whatsoever  now when you go into that jury room i want you to read them together and use your good old-fashioned common sense and take whatever time you need to reach your verdict until you are all each and every one of you satisfied with it   if you have any questions i want you to put them in writing and give them to the foreperson that you have chosen  he's in charge of the jury  and that writing will be drawn to my attention  then i'll spend some time considering questions with which you need help   i'll review them with counsel and then i'll call you back  and i'm quite prepared to deal with the questions and any other problems that you may have   if anything i have said to you is unclear or you wish  further instructions do not hesitate to ask  now when you leave i'm going to ask the court counsel here  whether i've understated or overstated or simply made a mistake in respect of my charge  and it may well be that i will call you back for further directions  after i 've canvassed all court counsellors  if i do that there may be a danger that you will place too much emphasis on what i say at that time than what i just told you in in in during my address  please don't do that  should i recall you you must consider what i say in the light of what i'm telling saying to you now  with that ladies and gentlemen of the jury i'm going to ask  the the sheriff's officer to swear   one or two words that he's going to be responsible for your care  thank you very much and go ahead and try to five or six words   is frank still guilty   if if he did participate in the  beating in that hallway  if he'd held raoul down while charles was being kicked if he himself punched raoul frank woulda  would've known  i've done something wrong here   word reif come in what does  frank do  sentence   he then takes a tour with name cos no one's been looking after riley's and a hundred and fifty patrons all of a sudden   a short tour and comes back  if you feel guilty wouldn't you wanna  want to stay there to ensure that people one or two words  the allegations and tell word my story  hey this guy beat me   and then frank would say no no i didn't  why did he take off  why did he go around and then come back   it's just completely inconsistent with a guilty person's conduct within the staff two or three words   if you're going to be clear that up until the night  four or five words raoul eto the doormen  simply wanted to get raoul word out of  word   no questions asked  there's no indication that they wanted to harm these people  there's no indication that they wanted to take any particular vengeance out on raoul and and  richard and andrew and and  charles they just simply want to get them out of riley's for their hundred and fifty patrons   they're doing their job   all the word according to the evidence of  raoul eto and charles montebank four or five words  and these four accused turned in a vicious attack   that was their suggestion that they turned just like that  they ran out there and they beat raoul eto mercilessly  they did it in a back hallway word a bathroom  sounds a lot to me ladies and gentlemen like the  guys are under a lot of stress  they're angry and upset  on the night involved they're gonna going to   go over the limit  they're gonna going to take their vengeance out   i suggest that word very very unusual behaviour for essentially three of them uh doormen  they know what they're doing   they don't wanna want to have any trouble with anybody they just simply want everything peaceful  two or three words   there's a similar why do  four clean-cut decent kids with good academic records good work records some of them holding down two jobs all of a sudden at one collective time all together turn into two or three words  is that unusual  i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen maybe a word or hesitation of the jury that it's very unusual  utterance   they're just doing their jobs  they're trying to do it the best way that they know how  if however that causes a lot of assault going on   six to eight words sentence word    these are just eight youths  four or five words that i would  uh that i wouldn't have to concentrate on several words   i'd also like to deal for a short moment here with the instances we've seen in the evidence itself  these aren't in instances  of common sense but rather dealing with the differences in the crown's evidence   the majority of the crown's witnesses ladies and gentlemen  to varying degrees had consumed quantities of alcohol of various kinds  utterance   uh we have margaritas   we have shooters  we have free beer  a lot of free beer one or two words between nine and ten o'clock  except for tom jones and don maller the other friends of raoul eto including raoul eto himself were drinking possibly two words, very quiet   they were drunk  any suggestion ladies and gentlemen that they weren't drunk or they weren't intoxicated or gee you know i can handle myself with  beer   these guys had a lot to drink  these people were uhm were out for a good time  look how much drink between nine and ten and they were going  to realize it   you've heard the evidence of tim makinski of john sawyer going out and back along one or two words   to cash in his money and cash word   this is consistent with people who want to have a good time   now it does not take medical evidence to convince  people that consumption of alcohol has many effects on the mind  firstly it dulls the memory  recollection is two or three words   secondly it affects your perception of what's going on around you  fantasy becomes reality and reality becomes word  the concept of time and place actually become warped   thirdly you become less inhibited than you were when you were sober  all three of those effects of alcohol apply to this case    the difficulty of word is that word  rely in large part on the recollection of the individuals who were drunk or intoxicated  after three or four words i was still at a loss as to exactly what happened on the evening of september thirteenth september fourteenth   i i must've heard ten different versions of exactly what happened  i didn't know  it was only until the defence actually took the stand who put the puzzle together   who put it all together although there were some maj  some major inconsistencies but they made  it it sound sounds reasonable and logical as to what happened   the doormen weren't drunk  two or three words their job  and and word  tell word exactly what happened on that night  word it's perhaps a word  the first time that any of them had ever been arrested for doing anything wrong two or three words   i wanna want to draw to your attention several observations that i have listed five or six words  you would also have other other things or other questions that might be going on in your mind five or six words
