 when the person who paid for the painting is actually part of painting itself  does anybody have any questions  mhh hmm   question   the red  wha what   clarifies question   ya it's just part of the throne and it links it to mary  so but if we think of the colour red or blue and if we think of how people uhm got paint those days  you know they obviously didn't buy it at their local art stores  where would they have gotten the colours to grind in for the pigments   what would those come from  answer   ya they would often come from fruits or vegetables and dyes but the ones that were to last really long would also be from rocks and minerals  right  have you seen very many rock red or blue rocks  in your lifetime  no  they're among the most rare pigments  so it would make sense when they when they're   making paintings like this that they're going to reserve these more  rare colours for the things that have the most important part of the painting themselves  so we'll see these colours again in the painting ah soon  any other questions  mhh hmm   question   okay i'll show you  it's uh just right up here  it's kind of scratched in the painting itself  so as we ah go to the next room you can take a closer look at it   any other questions  no  okay tape cuts out   just going to explain a little bit about how the lighting system works   uhm we're actually going to go though this way  uh you can see that these skylights open up directly to the to the well allows them the light to come directly into these galleries   so those blinds underneath the skylights just are uhm connected to a computer that limits the amount of light that comes in  so if all of a sudden it gets sunny then the blinds will close quite a bit  uh so it's all regulated very specifically  as we walk through here you're going to see circular windows  the same type of skylight exists on the other side of this wall only in this case it's to allow the natural lighting to go all the way down to the canadian galleries underneath us  so that's what we're going to be seeing through these windows  tape cuts out   so i'll begin by talking about the price of this painting  not because i think that the price of any painting is of particular significance but i can hear you all talking about it and the first question i was asked was how much is it worth and i believe it's worth about four million dollars  how much we paid for it uh the national gallery paid one point seven eight million for it a few years ago  and it was pretty much the purchase of the painting ah that received a lot of attention because this painting was hanging in this room for a couple of years before and nobody took much notice of it and then uh the gallery finally bought it and of course it meant for probably the first time in the history of canada uh people were actually talking about art  so uhm i'll discuss a little bit why this painting has the market value that it does and then after that i'd be glad to answer any questions that you have about that particular aspect of it  okay  so barnett newman is the name of the artist  he is an american artist  he was born in nineteen oh two  he painted this in nineteen sixty-seven  so how old was he then   sixty-five years old at the time  he died three years later   and uh today in nineteen ninety-five he's considered to be probably uh the most important artist since the second world war  he only did about a hundred and thirty-five works of art in his lifetime  and so you can imagine that there are many art galleries like this one whose mandate it is to collect art that's considered important in its time that want to collect works by him and others who worked uh in new york around the same time  so does that answer your question about the market value itself  you know supply demand uhm  just like a pair of nike running shoes or a hockey player  right  it just depends on what people want to spend  how many have that talent or how many are th   there in the world and it drives the price up  alright   answer   so ya   that moves us to stage two  you are probably wondering why this painting suspected speakers not recorded   you guys just want to listen at the back for a minute  i'm trying to explain it to you  you might be wondering why uhm this very simple looking painting  is considered so important  right  or why the artist who painted it is considered so important  it looks so simple  anybody could do it blah blah blah   right  okay ehm so what i'll do is i'll take you back further than nineteen sixty-seven  i'll take you back to nineteen fifty-one or nineteen fifty-two when that little painting over there was painted  can you imagine living in that time and seeing a painting like that  how do you think that was received by the public   answer   pardon me  answer   answer   boring   what comments do you think people would have made  answer   plain  i could do it  my grandchild could do it  right  things like that  depending on how old we are my little brother et cetera  so we have to wonder why an artist forty years ago or fifty years ago would decide to put such a simple painting in the world  right  i mean he obviously uh he didn't get very much  or he didn't have very much support from even other artists  jackson pollock whose work is over there was about the only artist that supported him  i won't give you too much of a sob story of the starving artist but apparently he actually did have to sell things that he owned to put   art food on the table   so why did he do these simple simple paintings  one of the reasons was he wanted his paintings to be for everybody  so if we think of how a painting can be for everybody then we will not ask in front of a painting like this what does it represent in the same way that we would ask that question in the painting that i just showed you  right  and i very uhm you know uh gradually told you what the other painting represented  the cow or the pig represented this or the uhm pineapple represented that  so every object had this specific meaning that was hidden from us as twentieth century ah canadians let's say  it was really made for fourteenth century flemish christians the last painting  this painting we're not gonna going to   look at the meanings behind it but in fact we are actually going to look at the painting  and that difference is really i think the the  most crucial thing to to realize when we look at this painting  so what i'm going to suggest is that we actually look at this in a very specific way  i'm going to give you instructions to look at this painting  does it do you mind doing that  i do it just to save a bit of time in and i you know we want to see van gogh and other things as well  so would you mind following my instructions for a couple of minutes   kay okay i promise you i won't make you look at the painting for longer than two minutes  kay okay   could i borrow somebody's watch to ensure that i'll only make you look at it for two minutes  okay  whatever   laugh okay  i'm timing you  i would like you to look at the blue stripe on your right hand side for the entire two minutes  so we'll start   interrupts   that's okay   no no i'll just look at it  so we will start now tape cuts out   we'll just focus our eyes all that time just on the blue to the right  the red's gonna going to try to creep in a bit but just keep refocusing on the blue tape cuts out   kay okay one minute has gone by so we'll look at it for another minute tape cuts out   there are thirty seconds left  they're the the most crucial thirty seconds tape cuts out   so what happens to the blues multiple audience members respond. speaker a engages their thoughts   is anybody still looking at the painting  does the whole painting look like it's coming off the wall  multiple audience members agree   laugh so see what i mean the difference between looking at the painting and looking at the meaning behind it  right  ehm i just choose that as something specific just cos i know  our time is fairly limited but i promise you that if anybody here spent twenty minutes in front of this painting with an open mind it would do pretty incredible things  the only thing is is that we live in a society even more then when this was made twenty-five years ago that we expect to get something really quick  right  so it doesn't dawn on people to look at it longer than just to say okay it's three stripes and go onto the next thing  so uhm when i do that  it's just certainly one way to look at it  it's not the only way to look at it  but i know that it gives you a pretty dramatic uh effect  so that's just one thing that i choose but i certainly don't   wanna want to give the impression that you know you have to have these special instructions behind every one  but did you like that experience  was it cool   okay  so you can see that you have to be here for the painting to work  you have to be open to what it has to offer  if you spend twenty seconds looking at this work which is probably more than a lot of people will spend looking at it then your experience is going to be much different than if you actually sit down and give it a chance  right  so what we realize is a lot of what we get out of it it comes from within us  so if we're open to what it has to offer then we'll get something  if we're just you know worried about how hard it is to make from a technical point of view we'd probably be more impressed with the person who laid down this floor  you know  uh we don't know the person's name but it's true that person has a lot of talent and was probably chosen pretty carefully because of his technical skills  with art although the technique is often important some artists feel that to accomplish their idea the technique might be  more simple in some cases more involved in others  it depend pends   depends really what kind of things they want to get across or what kind of idea they want to get across  any comments or questions   no   question   pardon me  repeats question </o  in a sense   you know i choose that because it's probably the most dramatic one  and and so it gets across the point really clearly  if you look at that one it does neat things too  it's a little bit more subtle  but uh certainly also in in the nineteen sixties there were a lot of artists that worked with optical effects and were interested in that effect  i'd say with barnett newman what makes him a little bit different from many abstract artists is that there's ah he offers you a little bit more  it's laugh hard to explain a little bit but there's kind of ah a subject there or something uhm i'd say more moving in his works than some of the op art that is just optical illusions although i realize that i just showed you an optical illusion  i said there's other ways of looking at it too   okay   any other questions comments  mhh hmm   question   kay okay why don't we take a look at it  we'll what we'll do is we'll stand up in a certain area and we'll all look at it together tape cuts out  and around this area so that we're in front of this  painting uh sculpture   so if you're towards the centre you'll probably have the best point of view   kay okay so my first question to you is is this a beautiful work of art audience responds  no  so the artist obviously made this so we would have some kind of reaction other than an aesthetic one  you know we're going to look at it differently than it's a piece of wallpaper or a new pair shoes
