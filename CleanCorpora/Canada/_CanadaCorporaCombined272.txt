 together it is these reforms that produce the strongest framework of economic union since confederation  mister speaker we propose as well a canada clause which would be entrenched in the body of the constitution in section two of the constitution act   i hope and believe that all of our people will see reflected in that clause their own place in canada the common values and aspirations that unite us and our national characteristics and our identity as we wish it to be  we are a nation with an immense capacity for generosity and compromise a capacity that has never mattered more than it matters today   parochialism small-mindedness mistrust these are always present in any society   these lesser attributes have had their day   it's now time for the fundamental qualities of generosity and compromise to dominate the process   there are in all twenty-eight proposals that the government of canada is putting forward today for consideration by the joint committee and discussion with the people of canada  french, 45 seconds applause, 7 seconds   mister speaker these proposals which are perfectible which are going to a committee which will begin hearing tomorrow will hopefully be examined in an objective and fair-minded manner not by people  sear searching for perfection because perfection can become the enemy of the good but for proposals that are good for canada  no one need lose   this isn't if if if the cause and the hopes and aspirations of western canada are advanced  that does not mean that that advan advancement  means a lose for quebec  and if french canadians feel no more secure as a result of constitutional proposals and feel a greater attachment and a greater love for canada that doesn't mean that the rights of canadians   in english canada in english-speaking canada say in the atlantic regions need in any way be diminished  this can  constitutional proposals fairly considered actively debated  generously contemplated can be what they should be a win-win situation for all canadians applause, 10 seconds   and how are they to be considered   well each one of us across the country each premier or each  taxpayer or each parliamentarian each of us will have to establish i suppose his or her own sense of parameters and his or her own   sounds like " hone" objective criteria  but i think that these proposals must also be considered in light of our greatest obligation  we've got many obligations  you can enumerate them  you can count em them   you can divide em them   you can add em them up  but our greatest obligation as canadians and as parliamentarians sitting here today is to turn canada over to our children and our grandchildren unsullied and undiminished as a great prosperous united nation  that is our fundamental obligation  applause, 15 seconds   and to do that will require compromise  and compromise is not an indication of weakness  honourable compromise in canada has always been seen as an indication of strength and maturity  the wisdom of knowing uh that all of us have to find our own places in the canadian sunlight makes me hopeful mister speaker that this proposal these series of proposals once engaged will give us all the opportunity to participate in the building of canada  thomas d'arcy mcgee who was a son of ireland but who became a father of canada saw a brilliant future for our country  seven years before confederation he said i look to the future of my adoptive country with hope though not without anxiety   quote continues   mister speaker i along with all other members of this house and all political parties i too see such a country a country of women and men of your children and mine whose standard of living is the envy of millions and whose way of life is admired around the world  this country canada the second largest country on earth is also according to the united nations one of the two best countries in the world in which to live and the challenge for us now is to make canada second to none applause, 10 seconds   the challenge is to build a stronger country for the security and the prosperity of all canadians  mister speaker i have said in this house and other occasions that the job of nation building did not end with confederation  and had they sought had the father of confederation sought perfection and insisted on perfection there'd have been no canada in eighteen sixty-seven  and that was the beginning of nation building but it continues with each generation and it continues to this day in our minds and in our hearts  and we want as mcgee said a constitution cherished in the hearts of all of its people  not part of its people not some of its people not the people who live in the west and the east but english-speaking canadians french-speaking canadians from the north the south the east all canadians are deserving of a constitution that re represents  them and reflects their hopes and dreams and aspirations for a new and a better canada applause, 10 seconds   so we have the challenge to keep canada and today we have the opportunity to improve it  mister speaker nothing would serve the economic interests of all canadians more directly than clear resolution of constitutional challenges  they've bedevilled this nation for too long  and i think it would be with a sense of national relief and gratitude that all canadians dealt with a proposal and managed to bring this to a successful conclusion  in that spirit i invite all canadians all political parties who believe in one undiminished canada to set aside other differences and to engage in nation building with the full exuberance that this magnificent country deserves  i suggest mister speaker we get on with it the building of canada of the vision of mcdonald and cartier and mcgee and the country of our own dreams a new canada for a new century honoured in the family of nations as a modern and flexible and caring country a canada respected by its peers a canada loved by its people a canada better able to serve its citizens with governments and institutions revised and reformed by this parliament and by all canadians that will be tied to the very best that canada can provide applause, 1 minute 15 seconds   introduction applause, 25 seconds   mister speaker i rise in this house today very conscious of the importance of the issue before us   at a time of significant national debate each of us must fulfill our duty to the best of our ability  at a time when there is cynicism about the role of politicians it is particularly important that the political process work the way it should  i want to be very clear mister speaker that the role of opposition is not to give a blank cheque to the government nor it is our role to oppose simply for the sake of opposing something  the role of the opposition is to scrutinize to ask the right questions to propose improvements and to seek to correct error   the role of the opposition is to speak for those who have no voice  this is a role that we will fulfill in the months ahead  i want to say that our objective is the unity of the country  but applause but this does not mean that we will necessarily agree with all of the proposals of the government  indeed our first impression is that the proposals of the government need a great deal of work  over the next few months some of the debate will be about issues of principle and we will fight for our principle by proposing improvements but much of the debate will be about legal text   what does one word mean  what does one phrase mean  are these flaws that can be corrected or improvements that can be made  french, 1 minute 5 seconds   part of audio cut out individual governments and the courts must rely upon it must accurately reflect the intention of its authors  let us resolve not to transform a debate on legal meaning of proposals into an emotional debate about rejections and humiliation and let us not transform a debate about values into a lot of empty rhetoric and political posturing  clearly it is too early for anyone to state definitively a hard and fast position on the government papers  constitutional language is extremely important  and some of the government paper lacks legal precision  in many places we do not have a specific proposal just a list of options   over the coming weeks and months with the help of the people of canada we in this party will work to find the tape cutes out   in this round we will not tolerate constitutional wording which is so deliberately ambiguous that it can be used to mean one thing in one part of canada and something else in other part of country applause, 10 seconds   ensuring that these proposals are thoroughly debated  thoroughly reviewed and where necessary amended abandoned or enlarged that is our duty  it is a duty we in this party will honour  we will not compromise on principles   french, 20 seconds applause, 5 seconds   french, 3 minutes 5 seconds   part of audio cut out are written for all to see mister speaker  the people should never be ignored  i will hold the prime minister to his promise made today before the entire nation his promise to involve the people of canada in this new round  applause, 10 seconds   this joint parliamentary committee is to report at the end of february   we must use the remaining time to study the proposals to debate their meaning to consult widely and to listen to the people of canada  mister speaker i have spent time talking about the process  because the process is very important   now i will address principle which are equally important   one of canada's greatest constitutional thinkers the late professor  scott f r scott once wrote that if canadians can agree upon great and lasting principles upon which they wish their society to be built  then they can agree upon the broad outlines of a constitution to achieve these ends end of quote   our principle as liberal are clear  one what is proposed must be compatible with the very nature of canada a nation which finds its raison d'&ecircumflex;tre  in sharing diversity and respect for r   the right of individual  two applause, 5 seconds   two the solutions proposed must result in real reform of our political institutions to ensure that the distinct concern of canada's regions are respected   three the solution proposed must recognize the need to renew and modernize our economic instrument including the training and mobility of our workforce to create policies that will permit us to be competitive in the world of tomorrow   fourth constitutional reform must not weaken must not weaken the right of individual as guaranteed in the charter of right and freedom  applause, 7 seconds   fifth constitutional reform must not weaken canadian duality and official language minorities everywhere in canada  six constitutional reform must not weaken canada's cultural diversity and its heritage of tolerance   and finally number seven constitutional reform must not weaken the ability of a strong federal government to speak and act for all canadians  applause, 15 seconds   mister speaker the liberal party of canada entered this party convinced that the things we call canadian values are as relevant today as they have been at any time in our history   at a time when canadian values are under attack and when our country is divided as never before we believe that canadians must remind themselves of the greatness of the canadian experiment   we also believe that canadians must devote their energies to finding new bonds and new endeavours which reflect our collective values  we must concentrate now on what unite us and not what divide us  applause, 7 seconds   more than ever we must commit ourself to true canadian values values like generosity of spirit and collective action  values that will permit us to meet the next century with our head held high  in discussing constitutional reform we must reflect on the great and lasting principles of our society   constitutional reforms must have one goal mister speaker and only one goal  that is the well-being not of governments not of politicians  not of bureaucrats but the citizens of canada applause, 7 seconds  which government holds which powers only matters in as much as citizens are well-served  therefore to serve the citizens of canada and that is what all of us have been elected to do to serve them we must understand the values we share as canadians  after all canadian citizenship means more than a shared passport  it is shared values  and quite frankly canadian citizens have a right to a government that can speak and act for all canadians  as canadians we have a unique and profound commitment to a shared sense of social responsibility
