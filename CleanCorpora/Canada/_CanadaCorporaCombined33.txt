 you know   ya but no i i you know   that's that's important and and  and uh i mean that's part of the reason people teach i think  mhh  uhm but i i quess it's a sh it's a short term project for me   for now anyway unless i come back at it again later on down the road  with with other things in mind  mhhm   ya   with new stuff  mhh  that's how i'm feeling  but in a way i don't know i just uh i just  see sort of how you are and stuff i think we   whe regardless of how you act tape cuts out   okay so what were you telling me about the women   women in work  ya well it's a   oh and then they get the keynote speaker  and that was that and that was it   it was a it's a really good idea every year we run this uh symposium  i shouldn't say every year  ya   we've been doing this for two years so this is the second year we've run a symposium  the idea is to uhm give uh our female m b a students some role models uh people who women who have m b a degrees or women who are in business or both and ah who have made it out there  mhh hmm   and so in the morning we had we had these six speakers who are m b a graduates all women  and they're obviously successful  they came in and they gave fifteen minute presentations on  what it's like uh out there for for  women   did you hear them  ya i heard some of them  some of i i   had to duck in   well was it interesting   what kind of things did they say  oh it was wonderful  i mean suzanne rayne talked about she   ha ha having to have her husband co-sign a a bank loan to start her business and now she signs her husband's  paychecks and all that kind of thing   uh huh   right ya ya   it was really it was extremely  interesting  it was very very good for our students  cos they're worried about going out there in the real world and  all of that   uh huh   ya   but they've got education for real world  they've got real education for the real world   they've got real education for the real world but  they're still afraid  but there must be several real worlds  cos the cos the laugh one that we're in here doesn't have too many job opportunities right now  so   at least laugh   no no  so they got these uh good role models and then in the afternoon we had uh six people  four women and two men who are on a panel and they talked about  well actually what we did we took quotations from ah a book called members of the club question mark  and then it was about women who are mostly about women who are who are well just commenting on business  and it was extremely neat because the issues are very controversial  i mean how do women make it in business these days  do they do they act like men  mhh hmm   and and what are the problems  and and we you always refer to the glass ceiling and this book proposes another idea  ya   that it has more to do with the comfort zone as they call it  that there are that men have a tendency to feel uncomfortable around women in business ehm that's difficult for them to work with  n not that they want to deny them opportunities although that might be the case in some instances it's more that they're just not comfortable  mhh hmm   ya  and because they're not comfortable women don't have an opportunity to negotiate and assert themselves because they  don't get invited out to that lunch for  example   mhh hmm   ya ya  the men will go out for lunch  they'll exclude the women and at lunch a lot of stuff happens  ya  so they don't have those opportunities for informal  networking in in their own companies which often ends up being very important  ya  so the women have this difficulty  they debated issues of family and how women deal with all of that stuff  you know the career track versus the family track and  whe whether you delay having your family or you have it now and deal with it and get it over with and you know all that kind of thing  mhh hmm  i shouldn't say get it over with but you know   uhm and then in the evening we had our keynote person who was  michelle sherette   mhh hmm  she's the president and c e o of signal films  and she was terrific   she was really really wonderful  she didn't give the members of the audience a lot of platitudes  it was very hard-nosed  really good advice  and uh and everybody loved it  we we had you know wine and cheese after  mhh hmm  it was great networking  and and i i  was very impressed with all these uhh people  w i was impressed with how hard they work   i mean these women work hard long long hours   and uhm that seem to be a given these days  you < } > wanna want to   ya if you wanna want to  get anywhere you gotta have got to   work like a fiend  ya   i know  not that you wouldn't know anything about that  my experience of you jen is that you work pretty uh   ya   ya but well i'm just trying to uh   to get my get the backlog cleared up  i i i'm so sick of the mess  ya  you know it was like three years like running grabbing shoving grabbing you know papers and not putting them back where they belong and you know backing-up files  ya   i i haven't  there's a lot of   you need a secretary  i word secretary couldn't figure it out  you need a full-time   but anyways you you  know what i mean though  ya   ya  so i was just running like such a a a  lunatic for so long  so i actually started again in my office today and i wanna  want to go through it  mhh hmm  and i found all of the research articles i have to return to someone  ya  exhale   do you wh do you keep  stuff on your computer  i mean do you do you have your own filing system on your  word office word    i have i have all my  you know all my sounds of english and all my  stuff like that  ya   a lot of the the the handout or  the the worksheets i've done for my students that  everything's in there  how do you keep track of articles   i mean after a while   but you can't keep articles in there  no you can't but how do you yourself when you're  your own   okay this is a very good question laugh  because i've been trying to figure out what i'm doing   because we keep we  we collect hundreds of articles  really   i mean   oh you mean like ah magazine articles or journal articles   academic articles okay so  things you photocopy  anyways   ya journal articles   well i was i'm just  about to start dealing with that  now i know what i did when i researched the last thing was i started punching holes in everything and putting them in binders  mhh hmm  but then it's a question of how to divvy it up but i think that i'm gonna going to look for what seems to be a natural category for it  mhh hmm  but i'm not sure  like all the stuff i have on from  statscan statistics canada on the immigrant literacy that type  of thing that'll be a separate section  mhh hmm   there's no point mixing that with with   uhm learning disability research  no no  is that whatcha what you mean  ya  and i'm not sure  and then i suppose it has to be somewhat chronological   so you don't you don't have   a a list somewhere on your computer  where you just have  au authors you know   no   oh that's an idea too eh  ya   where you just say so and so nineteen eighty-nine   and maybe the title and something like that  and then see if i have it   i'm always trying to figure out ways  maybe it's because i'm a capricorn   i'll ask max   i'm always trying to figure out ways of  organizing material   max has phenomemal  has phenomenal systems  everytime i  oh he's just beginning to make me sick  ya   i know how i drove people crazy when i was semi-organized   inhale cos i'm real  mhh hmm   you know he has a system where he types in z z z or q q q   when he's working  mhh hmm   one means he doesn't like something he wants to change it and another is where he hasn't finished  i don't understand  he does a word search on q q q he finds out all the places he wants to improve upon  ya   ohh  okay  he wants to find out where he finished z z z  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   cool stuff   wow word   the guy's sharp  i sorta sort of feel like i should really you know i should really take advantage of learning what i can because he's really developed great systems  mhh hmm  you know there's time you can save if you're organized   is phenomenal   exactly exactly  and that's where i'm i'm feeling   like i'm i'm like i've got this huge bag on my back and i've got to take it off and poke through it all the time  it's crazy   mhh hmm mhh hmm   it's not me  it's not the way that uh that   i normally word i normally function  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  it's so unnatural for me to be in this state  i was really a wreck  i'm beginning to get normal  i'm not going to sleep at four o'clock everyday anymore but uhm  it's been hard  mhh hmm mhh hmm  i brought you this  if you know anybody that wants to look at it they're coming to my house because my old the old owner uhm subscribed  i've sent max with this stack of them   the old owner of your house  ya  i sent max with a stack  i mean imagine eh three years later  i've sent a stack of them with max to uh loyola but  uh i don't know what  mhh hmm   well   also this has your name on it   it certainly does  but what ah   laugh   is this for me  i i ah it was yours  i think i borrowed it  i don't even remem remember   i didn't even look  i just grabbed it   is this for when we took the course   what is it  new test from e t s educational testing service  uses realistic tasks from everyday life to assess the literacy skills of adults reading   oh ya  oh ya i remember this  canadian business task force on literacy  reading   alright alright   and what you mean i don't ha   have i didn't even check this out i don't think  what happened  you mean i photocopied this article and you didn't read it  i can't believe i didn't   cos this is this related to my course that i did this fall   hmm   oh can i borrow it again  well it's in the stack of six hundred articles that you still have to read  we all have six hundred articles don't we   six hundred articles   no i don't have that many  i've almost i'm almost through  the stack  ya   like this one is cool  remember how i was saying what was different about uh what i was doing  this one ah we don't want to sit here while you read it of   course but you can see by the amount of pink this is loaded with stuff relevant to the work i was doing with the the work  that i'm doing   with the sounds of english  mhh   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  not only that this is where they talk about alphabetic coding as opposed to phonics which is what i do  ya  ahhh  hmm   this is this is a neat stuff  speaker said " a"   this is very neat stuff  ya it is and it doesn't talk about the shapes of the words laugh   laugh no funny  ya ya ya
