 to to go into this context and say  well these are these are these are  really interesting human beings who are very much on the surface  if you can if they trust you   and there therefore there's ah an opportunity to to learn from  from what it is that they they have   to to say  uhm wh when  when people   uhh there was one person who who   i found this quite interesting who who   said to me  this was kind of an off-hand comment you know  said you know these missionaries got it all wrong about  uh about us cree people  they thought we worshipped a whole bunch of different gods but in fact we don't  we just worship the creator through creation  and i thought to myself this is a very interesting model cos i certainly wasn't taught this model when i was a kid  this is a very valuable kind of sharing of of  perceptions  uhm and it was those kinds of conversations   where i where i think it's possible to   to build bridges between cultures and and  instead of end up in a confrontational situation where we're negotiating for land for money and uhh this kind of thing     cough   uhm we've negotiated for for land with the the cree people and many other groups in canada but in fact current research says that more jobs can be created through conservation than through the development of megaprojects   these are sustainable jobs for the long-haul  and conservation's best done by the people on the spot  mhh hmm   ya   mhh hmm   now they would prefer having mini-dams in their communities  for example  uh this would these they would be much more environmentally-friendly  they could manage them themselves without sophisticated computer technology   and uhm the they and they for in terms of   conservation for conservation they would be able to provide more people with work  and and we would provide more people in the south with work through conservation than through developing  these project   is there a a uhm a  good feeling about their population explosion or are they worried about it  are they happy about having all these babies or are  are they worried about  they are they are worried about it  they're cer certainly  they're on the one hand they're happy about having all the babies  uh though they're both  they're happy about having them and they're also worried about what it is they're  going to do uh uhh because they're drifting away from subsistence forms of life a few mumbled words     cough     maybe three words   which todd and uhh  todd at mcgill tobin todd the anthropologist says needs to be looked at uh because of the uh opportunities for harvesting different forms of wildlife to provide uh jobs   okay  it it's also uhh it's also compatible with job-sharing concepts  where people could actually share the same job and part of the time hunt and part of the time work in an office  uh this would fit in ve very   extremely neatly with their with their seasonal uh pursuits   because when when goose break is on  there's no point sending a consultant up north cos they're   they're not there  they're they're out in the bush  which is where they prefer to be i think i suppose  word very much  i felt uh uhm  sorry  uh on you   exclamation two words   ya   a couple of uh  i thought an interesting uhm observation on the point on page twenty-two where when you're estimating   obviously we always run into this in business education  how do you estimate the cost-effectiveness of business education versus traditional     mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and you uh this  struck me in the audit a good estimate of the  full cost of the purchase time is roughly three times his or her direct salary costs   mhh hmm  oh my gosh  that is cos normally as you say the the  direct cost and add on something quite a few words  but three times     cough   it seems to me a a very   maybe three words   it seems two words but when we factor in cough not only benefits but but  also uhm uh time lost uh for when people are absent from work  uh there are a variety of variables that go into the equation as far as i've been able to tell  i see   partial sentence two words   partial sentence   two words   right   it's that high is it    agreement   mhh hmm   ya   word sentence continues   three words     mhh hmm   so let's say w we'll just take a salary of a professor  what is it the average of seventy word   mhh hmm  so you walk in hire that person for a year we would budget two hundred and seventy thousand dollars  should  one of the reasons we don't function properly laugh   is that they don't budget that much and consequently we don't have the support and capabilities     mhh hmm   mhh hmm  but that's a societal cost  i mean the organization itself would not reap that  or or rather the the loss to the organization like the university and so on   isn't that isn't that   the replacement cost you're looking at here   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   the   s uh yes   it seems to me that maybe the the   the sort of global cost but   yes that's that's the  that's the global cost   or the societal cost that you know  because there is a when we do a  full costing that's what it comes up to  as as when we uhh consider the full cost of of a particular industry  we don't te we tend not to factor in cost to the environment or cost to health as a result of the existence of that particular industry  hmm   but that's not there's no full costing there  we do that we're trying to do that in education   and it's the formula is  it's complicated  right     exactly   okay bottom-line would government uh  contractors accept that kind of uh presentation of personnel  costs  cough   oh ya i doubt it  i i doubt it very seriously  yup  it's uh uh me too   laugh that's what word   laugh     cough   a few words societal versus the actual  a few words mumbled   this is is is  excluding ex externalities is it  sort of  ya   uh oh no  no i uh obviously that's a whole complicated subject according to word   so what would about what would you as a universilalia management consultant put in for uhm a a consultant to do a needs assessment for example   how would what kind of   oh well oh obviously they negotiate  mhh hmm   but if they took you out of the university and the university were given replacement costs  and let's say your salary here was seventy thousand dollars  and you were contracted for a year would they simply add the seventy plus the fifteen percent or whatever it is  overhead  and and put another twenty  percent  uh i get you   cough   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   p p probably     i i believe that that's what they do   ya so you you   okay so i am right in that  you know   mhh hmm  i shouldn't be uh maybe two words    actually you'd never expect uh that amount to be budgeted in the contract  right   that's right  exactly   mhh hmm   sentence   sentence   three words three words  sentence continues     mhh hmm   sentence   sentence   sentence   sentence   oh as a consultant yes  in negotiating yes maybe two words something else  sure   okay okay   when we look at the the  full cost multiplier  particularly in public  institutions we have to look at the   a cost of maintaining the office the person uses for example  ya   that's a big two words   agreement   cough   cough   building of the office in the first place  uh much of what the provincial government looks at is square  feet per individual working  that's often their bottom line     uh huh   and that's one of the problems that in fact that concordia's had at loyola  because concordia will say we have this much  this many square feet and the government will say you don't need anymore but so much of the loyola space is not usable     mhh hmm     mhh hmm  it it's uhh built on   a few words   and they're word for the  amount of space that uh a faculty member needs are  ridiculous to my word   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   ya so there are not   you cannot assume that one has a library or a  a few words   i can see that     word   it doesn't work word  failure   agreement   so there are so many things that are factored into  that in into  that and uh it is a cost somewhere     mhh   agreement   somebody has to pay uh for  and frequently we don't we don't  realize that  i mean most students for example don't realize a graduate  master's student costs society about eighteen thousand dollars a year  mhh hmm  uh students are paying     cough   well actually a bit less  about sixteen five if the student pays fifteen hundred  then then society picks up sixteen thousand five hundred dollars of of the cost  uh uhm it's it's expensive  mhh hmm  ya   uh i just have a couple more word    but what's society for laugh  exactly     a few words laugh     laugh word this     ya   the only reason we need an economy is so  that people can educate  themselves and uh   right laugh huh   uh huh   mhh hmm   one of the things i want to ask that question about reaching a critical mass in the community and so i was had  in the back of my mind community radio which would be a  certainly a catalyst or unifying factor in   in garnering that uh consent  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   uhm has has radio been used  in that sense   community radio is is    well to bring factions together   uhm uh no  actually i i think of some kind of fogo island model could be very  useful in   in the cree communities but i certainly haven't explored that  or at least initially     mhh hmm   agreement   i've just read about it uh uhm from that   but cough it could be used  right now they're the community radio stations are they're not on air all day  a lot of it is country and western music  and and announcements of political things  that are going on  sure that's right  it's an entertainment word   sure   it's not used as bridge building  no   uh word   word  one of the project i was just involved with in the philippines we went into communities which are very factionalized and uh this  radio by the community uhm really brought groups  together ah into a cohesive force  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   well it it's a it's also ah ah i don't know if i  w i won't call it a problem but there's a tendency for people to respect the elders uh in the in these   so the elders will say one thing in terms of maintaining traditions and the more modern people will then try to bypass the elders and and do something else  develop forestry instead of preserving traplines  and this this creates this creates  the factionalism  instead of opening a dialogue between the two and saying how can we have forestry and traplines together  like how   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i mean can we have selective cutting in a way that respects the word   or or maybe how can we uh milk some of the tourists who have a lot of money instead of forestry maybe have some kind of ah outfitting   cree  outfitting camps where they could make a lot of money and uhm you haven't cut down the forest in the process     uh huh     cough   and if you can keep aids to a minimum  yes  mhh hmm  ya well that's that's a problem too  uhm   well a lot of models in  communities across canada  i know in alberta and british columbia i mean they're doing that   and doing it very well  hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  a few words   and and and community   television too should now  the uhm the uh inuit uh   are have done some  word   word   oh yes the inuit broadcasting corporation  has two words fifteen sixteen years now   mhh hmm mhh hmm     ya     mhh hmm  because presumably if you can get the olders   eld elder elders on television in some kind of debate with some of these   mhh hmm   you say there are three factions the sort of evangelicals the elders and the the business uh types  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  uh it sounds like there could be some very interesting three way discussions if one could ever get these people  mh   oh it would be fascinating  agreement   the thing is that they tend   they don't like to disagree with each other  that's a that's a problem  they they they're not  they're not comfortable with disagreement so they therefore don't mumbled words   so bringing the disagreement out in the open ah as you would have to do to try and resolve it or develop  compromises is very hard to hard to   do   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   well the judgment circles and the healing circles and so on are all part of that
