 well marie macdonald was there like i was to witness uh the crowds boo and you don't often get that kind of uh volatile reaction at a tennis match  it's kinda kind of uh a staid crowd isn't it marie   and uh so it was a bit of a surpri- not a  not a surprise to see that but uh ah very different uh to experience that yesterday  yeah it's certainly not something you expect when you go to tennis  you expected at most little bit of polite applause or no applause  but but the boos certainly shook the stadium   as as rusedski walked in and walked out and took a breath and   well uh the the thing that got me too was that you know the boos didn't stop  and uh the umpire i guess had been instructed to to  quiet the crowd down by saying merci merci so as to try and get them to quiet down but it was kind of funny to hear  the the boos followed by the thank you boos thank you laugh   but that was his way of course to try to get the  the crowd to quiet down  but they weren't too out of hand  i guess not that unexpected though right that i mean you know this reaction was there  nooo  i mean greg rusedski everyone when we're talking about you know he's a native montrealer and he's welcome home but he doesn't consider himself a montrealer anymore  so you can't really expect much of a warm reception for someone  who who you know says that sort of thing  it was a tough day  he had two matches to play as you said he had to play in singles and in doubles  so maybe we can sort of start with with  the singles competition uhm which is really where the i guess we can call it the anti-greg rusedski sentiment uh started  and it started even before he walked out onto the court  you know as as he and michael joyce walked through their  through the stadium the crowd began to boo and we could see that they that he was coming just by the sound not even by by looking to notice him  and then as rusedski walked by the stands somebody actually took a tennis ball and threw it at him  now it missed him so he said oh it was okay but  but it did startle him and it sort of startled people in in  in the crowd who weren't really expecting that sort of   thing   yeah unnecessary word    unnecessary   i but i think the tennis ball i mean the tennis ball missile pretty much sums up what the match was like in terms of the crowd reaction  once in a while you'd get a little bit of light applause mm very polite applause  uhm there was a sign up in the stands which which  read in french welcome to montreal we love greg   but further along in the stands there was another sign which called greg rusedski le fou de la reine meaning the queen's fool   laugh yeah   so not uh not laugh a particularly welcoming  ah welcoming thing to look at  now i mean once in a while mm you m- uh might have thought you know and and you woulda   would have been correct in thinking that michael joyce was a canadian cos he certainly was the favourite in this match  and the cheers were so loud for him every time he won a point or anytime he touched the ball actually  they were about as loud as the the  cheers that rusedski got when he blew a point  now one of the things that was interesting was that greg rusedski  kept smiling throughout the match  he kept that smile pinned to his face from from  the warm up to the cool down to to  talking to to people later on  now either it was because it didn't bother him didn't want people to know he was bothered  but afterwards he said that it was because the crowd didn't bother him  didn't hurt my feelings or didn't hurt hurt  pronounced 'turt' me at all  i mean i i thought that i was going to get a a difficult reaction  i kind of expected it so i was prepared for it  i mean it was exciting i mean come on i mean how  how many times have you been to a tennis match and seen so much excitement from controversy going on  good practice for davis cup i guess  i i guess he makes a point to a certain extent and we saw that smile by the way in wimbledon  mm hm mm hm   again that match against pete sampras  even when he was losing he managed to maintain that smile  i wonder sometimes if whether or not that's a psychological technique that that he's e- employing   to to keep his spirit up uh when he plays tennis  well pete sampras was was quoted as saying that he really wanted to go out during wimbledon and wipe the smile off laugh greg rusedski's face so  wipe the smile off laugh   and y- you know it it was interesting because he he said that several times that he wasn't bothered by the boos and that he went out to just have some fun but it's interesting cos we talked to michael joyce the man   that that he faced in that match uh he saw a pretty different reaction when they walked out of the court together yesterday afternoon to that chorus of of boos  joyce says that you know the boos might not have affected greg rusedski during the match he mighta might have  been able to play but it certainly did have an effect on him before the game  i could tell before the match greg was really nervous and it didn't look like he was nervous because of he was playing me as much as it looked like he was nervous he doesn't know what really to expect  uhm  and so we walked out and all a sudden i hear-   we heard the boos coming and and  greg and i were kinda kind of laughing about it at first and  and then it just got you know even more and more  so it was it was tough because like i said again you know they're cheering for me but they're not really cheering for me because they like me they're just cheering for me cos  laugh he's the enemy all of a sudden  hmm  michael joyce uh talking a bit about uh the crowd reaction yesterday in his match with rusedski  now uh uh i notice he also said that uh it was difficult for him because he's a friend of rusedski so it put him in a tough spot  now rusedski uh as as tough as the afternoon was uh the doubles match in the evening was i guess even tougher  a bigger crowd and the sentiment even stronger  that's true  i mean he was not only going up against uhm a   a doubles team that was from quebec uh but it was uh  or from canada but a doubles team that was   that was from quebec  now when when the two sebastiens came in sebastien lareau and sebastien leblanc they were greeted by a standing ovation  and there was sort of a question of whether maybe the cheers for the quebecers would drown out the boos but you know that the   the sentiment switched  they walked in and soon as soon as the crowd saw rusedski the boos started  and they sort of trailed in came out in full force pronounced 'full forced'   and you know just to give you an idea of how loud they were you could hardly hear the player introductions coming out over the loudspeaker  now rusedski on the other hand said he thought the evening crowd actually showed more respect particularly towards his partner paul wekesa  i i thought it was calmer  when i came on i mean obviously gave us a little bit of a tough time but i thought they were very polite in certain respects because paul was there and i i was pleased about that because paul has nothing to do with it so  at least to give paul some respect  cough   that's uh again greg rusedski talking a bit about uh uhm his partner during uh the doubles match yesterday  uh now we've uh heard a lot from sebastien lareau and greg rusedski and the fact that there is uh some tension between the two  tell me a bit more about that element of all this and how it played out in the match and afterward  well i- tape cuts out   it actually started out uhm earlier before the game had even the match had even started  there was the talk that lareau had said the other day that there was a lot of motivation for him to win  rusedski uh in contrast said it was just going to be another tennis match for him but sebastien lareau said several times he had the motivation he really wanted to win this one he really wanted to win this one  uhm in the end and and  last night it switched  all of a sudden he was saying no it was just uh a regular match and it wasn't uh as important that he was just going out there to play to play tennis  rusedski felt the same way  but we've heard a lot from them from sebastien lareau and greg rusedski um but other canadian tennis players have remained relatively quiet  last night i had a chance to ask sebsatien leblanc what he thought of all the build up around this first doubles match  i saw the match as another match i guess  i i don't care about what greg does i don't care about what wekesa does   it's   they're just both tennis players  i i i think it's ridiculous that uh  you know you think it's a battle of ex-canadians  it doesn't matter what he's doing  uh it's his choice  i know it some well maybe it's not the right choice but if he if that's his choice that's good  but uh i think it's just ridiculous that you know you it's not a battle  tennis is a game and  sebastien leblanc  ma- marie macdonald thank you very much for this report  thanks kyle   and uh cam jeffreys joins me again  you know cam i was down uh at the old port last night and the c word was was the common uhm the   the c letter i should say uh was the theme as it turned out  i didn't actually go and and pay the three fifty that you have to to get on the pier to go see the show  i know lauren elliot was down there last night and i was there too late for him so i decided not to go  but i walked around and first i saw a street performer uh playing some cat stevens music  and then there was another street performer who was playing some show tunes from cats  and then there was uh somebody playing some cantonese music  so we got three cs so far  and then there was the aroma lady  have you run across the aroma lady yet  she is the woman who word   mmm no unless she's one of the women in the bays who squirts you with perfume or something   laugh no this is a different kind this is the morning aroma   okay laugh   the one that you're probably smelling this morning coffee  that's the other c  she walks around with a uh what looks like a huge backpack a space pack and it has a hose and she has coffee cups and she goes around giving free cups of coffee  i forget the name of the company that she does it for  it's probably a good thing  but uh she's the aroma lady and i and uh she   oh okay   but it's always coffee though that she uh  cos there are other kinds of aromas you know  there's not just coffee there's other uh unpleasant aromas too  that uh   it's always coffee   th we well  this this is the
