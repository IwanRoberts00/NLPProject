 they wanna want to know that   so that's why if you look at for example us as e s l teachers  in our specialty we have a uh an extra  complication to our first year of teaching in the sense of that we've worked with the communicative approach okay which is seen as something   which you which is a very open approach  it's something very uhm  you deal with the interests of the student  you learn with the uh ah the emotions even  you deal with it's a very personal kind of thing  it's a personality kind of thing okay  and to be able to obtain the communicative approach you have to break through you have to get to know the students on a real level  okay  but in order for them to trust you and to let them know  show you who they are as a person you have to gain you have to es to establish  that base of trust okay  you have to establish that  and i knew this from traditional teaching that you establish that trust and then the more as time goes on   then you know you can start de doing  new things and doing interesting things  so for the first teaching class for the first class i believe in a very straight traditional ah class in which the students learn vocabulary okay  and you say next class we'll have a test on all of these words   so they'll have to study okay  what does that mean when you give them a test on vocabulary   it means they're gonna going to come home  and then have to study english  and mom and dad are <-gonna going to say what are they studying  vocabulary  ah laughter   audience member speaks   eh  same audience member speaks   what kind of vocabulary   classroom vocabulary   teacher desk   things that you're <-gonna going to deal with in the classroom  same audience member speaks   yeah word good  that's what you want   you know you wanna want to do in-class  vocabulary   so that's the first class  audience member asks a question   sure  same audience member continues the question   yeah  same audience member continues the question   you see yeah   th it's it depends on how you look at it  same audience member responds   okay  uh i see it from the point of view of the first class   maybe it has it has a lot to do with learning but it has more to do with procedures  okay     responds   and the idea of of going okay let's give me the ten words you know well then you're dealing with the idea of maybe they're <-gonna going to say they don't know anything  same audience member responds   and i'm looking at it from the point of view of a   of you're going in there and they know zero and you have to teach them english  same audience member asks a question   at first yeah  at first   and then you more and more as time goes on  we're just talking the first class eh   we're talking you gotta got to keep that in mind that   audience member comments   maybe not  don't be surprised   same audience member comments   audience member comments   yeah  audience member continues comments   right  audience member continues comments   you're gonna going to  ye ye cos then you're dealing with confrontation  audience member responds   you don't wanna want to deal with confrontation  you wanna want to deal with you're a competent teacher you know word   audience member comments   right  audience member continues comments   right  audience member continues comments   and then the day and when you have that test you're gonna going to see if your class is strong or very weak  audience member continues comments   cos you'll be surprised  cos you'll have a basic vocabulary test and i can tell you could be secondary five   cos the vocabulary that i work with i'm in secondary one and two but i've taught secondary four and five and i worked with primary vocabulary you know the text the text  they give you and a lot of them don't know it   audience member continues comments   and that's not a bad thing  i'm not trying to shock you or oh my god  this is this is  vocabulary  this is some know it some don't   and i think it's a good start you know   uhm but ah the the thing that i'm ah  the point that i'm trying to get through is the trust   because they wanna want to see if you're a good teacher or a bad teacher   you know and and you have to get  that that uh that trust is very very important uh   audience member comments   mm hmm  audience member continues comments   yes  audience member continues comments   mm hmm  audience member continues comments  $a> no  audience member continues comments   definitely  audience member continues comments   w well okay that's a g  the the difference is between night and day really  the difference is between having an efficient class in which you're able to to uh teach and students to learn compared to a class in which ah you're dealing with discipline problems all the time  ah you're trying to to you know you don't have the you don't have the control of the class    you know y y y  they don't listen to you when you're speaking  you don't have respect   you know they walk all over you kind of thing   you know the first year that i was teaching uh the first day  the first group i had was a strong group okay  this group had a eighty percent average since secondary one and they were always together  and i had them in secondary five   but i didn't know that okay  they always told me that it was a strong group strong group strong group  but you don't know what a strong group is when you're starting  you don't know what a weak group is once you're starting  and i came in and you know and makes a clapping noise  this and you know my heart's jumping  and uh my activity was a flight activity  i don't know if you're familiar with flight  it's a communicative approach book  it's a good book   and the first one is t the first activity is take off you know  and and it's uh it's  a thing where they take you you cut these little numbers and then you give the kids the numbers and then the kids  take the numbers and they go into groups   and it's about key words and they have to take the groups and then they come in front of the class and  it sounds wonderful awkward laugh   and i was with a strong group   and uh they walked in and the bell rang  and like one guy comes in right after the bell rings and goes  drrrrr-ring voices the noise of a school buzzer   and he walks in and i go hey hey don't be late hey  don't snaps fingers be late to my class audience laughs   right away you're   and they're like whoa you know  yeah like right away i was like jumpy you know   right away i was very strict and like audience laughs  three or four words   and then they then they did the group thing  and then it was like free-for-all you know  it did you know because they don't  they don't understand the procedures of the class   it's a complicated thing teaching you know going into groups  and and you know it's a lot of ah class management   so uh my first day of teaching was like that you know  and i didn't have the m i didn't have the method so i photocopied everything  you know they didn't have method then so i photocopied  all the all the work that they had  then my next group was a very very very very weak group  okay  so i thought it went well for my first class you know  sure they they you know it was free-for-all and word   but they were nice kids you know  they were like you know they were all like   kids of teachers and things and they were like  they're having fun with me but they're you know   they were nice basically   but then i went into a tough group okay  and this group laugh starts okay in secondary laugh ends three and  have you ever heard of french expression    have you ever heard that expression  have you ever  well it means that they're students who who  have uh ah l at least two years of ah uhm  yeah of of snaps fingers uh   they're behind at least two years audience can be heard mumbling in background   yeah they're weak students   now what they did at my school was i knew about   french expression cos i had a course in it   audience laughs   and i asked them at the job interview i said am i teaching the french expression and they said no you're not  but what they did in my school was they just took off the word  audience laughs   you know no we don't have word  audience laughs   but of course all these students were in that before  someone in audience mumbles   pardon  member of audience makes a comment   yeah surprise  it was a big surprise  they were only nineteen students but it's like having a class of you know it's a big yah  and they they just like ah  you know i tried to speak and then they just say jokes to each other and then   right away it started off bad  you know two or three mumbled words   member of audience asks a question   well ah if you do have   it it really depends on the students that you're with  but what m my my feeling is  okay any group of students can be disruptive  you know they can be really great with one student and they with one word one teacher excuse me and then they could be really disruptive with another  member of audience responds   any group of people eh   like if you think of a riot or anything it's you know if you think of psychology any group of people can become something you doh don't   so there can be thirty against one  you can look at it that way   you know thirty against one  and when you're in that kind of confrontation kind of scene  you're a loser  you're gonna going to lose   okay and it's your first day and you don't wanna   want to get into that you know you  and n n what i what i  enjoy what i think is good about this actually is that you don't there is no confrontation  okay  if you say take out your okay write this down now there's no confrontation  you are teaching that's all  audience member comments   some may some may go oooh but  it's just the way it is  you're a teacher and you're tea   teaching you're stating a fact you know  same audience member continues comments   you're not there t you're not  wor you know   you're not trying to scare them   you're saying there's going to be a test on this  tomorrow   member of audience makes a comment   a quiz  same member of audience makes a comment   member of audience makes a comment     that's right     that's right  yeah you're trying to get that idea of uhm uh ah like that it's a businesslike attitude  that that is my my  way of of looking at it for a long time  we're in the business of of of them learning english  and the main thing is that you wanna want to  establish trust okay  and what you want to work with is what students know already  okay  so uhhh when you start teaching in the first few days   whatchoo what you wanna want to   look at is what the students know already   it it could be vocabulary  maybe it's something else   maybe you will have the bo the books   right away you know  but maybe uh what i'm trying to tell you is before you start that book you know before you think about how you want to teach  your teaching pronounced 'steaching' strategy   cos that's the most important thing  how you want to teach  and think about it hard  don't trust you know all this stuff around you  you have to find out what are you going to do here   on my first day i i think i wrote down everything i was going to say okay  like my my lesson plan was i think five pages long you know  and it it you know it goes down as time goes on  but it's just you know you're so much   and there's nothing wrong with that  i i don't think there's anything wrong with sitting down and really thinking about it you know  but uh i think it's it's to me  what i like about the idea of not having any confrontation at the beginning is that's what helps you to uh to   establish a relationship based on learning and not based on a power trip  and that if you do that then you're  gonna going to you're gonna  going to   even if you don't uh become very popular  even if you don't become the friend of the students or the most popular teacher you are going to have a long-term good teaching relationship with your students and you're gonna   going to feel good in your job you know if you're good as a teacher  because you're doing what you're sposed supposed  to be doing  and you're not gonna going to have to deal with a lot of emotional things you know you have to go through  uhm that's what i i want to talk to you about after i'm just gonna going to get into uh the identity crisis and what am i doing here anyway okay  nervous laugh   what happens is that uhm you you because   you you have your diploma your teaching diploma and you have your job and you have your workload and you start  thinking you're a teacher uh but you're not a teacher but you think you are   you're going through an identity crisis okay and you are starting to go oh what what am i anyways and who am i  and you're going to start questioning yourself as a person  okay  and a lot of this is when a lot of  people have burnouts you know your first year burnouts
