 i gather it it is correct  that that you weren't married at at   the time of this incident  i was engaged yeah  you were engaged  so it was your fiancee that you were two words   that's right  and uh uh what does your father do  what's his name what does he do  my dad's uh his name is george harrison and uh he has he works for  two words   and is that what he's always done  farmer before that and crop insurance  and uh so uhm would there be in any any connection in which you would be called the boss's son  no confused sigh no  do you have some sort of connection uh   what is your relationship with frank lawson   is he a supervisor of yours or  no  no he owns bob's realty in wonderland   so he is an owner separate from from  your business   that's right   that's right  and who owns your bus the one   that you work for  harry harley harley   li   harley li   harley li   and uh do you have some personal connection with that person  no  okay  uh what what is your position in the company that you work for  realtor  okay uhm is there a hierarchy  do you have someone that supervises you or do you just  go in and   no   it's just the owner and then uh agents  okay and that's you've been here doing that same position for five and half years two or three words  with bob's realty yes  now uhm how often do they have these kind of golf tournaments  really   once a year  is it is it an annual event  uhm  like do they do they ha is it is it  the same event every year   like always   uhm not necessarily always at jack's   they move around  yeah  how often have you gone before  how many times  uhm maybe twice  does everybody go  uhm not always  uh do you have any of your expenses paid or is there  any anything that that sort of two words   no we pay all  you pay for the golfing  yeah  and you pay for the food  mm hmm  is there anything that's offered by bob's realty   laugh no we're a hundred percent each   now uhm i gather that uh you were going to be uhm with the men that you were golfing with uhm  hadn't you known them from before  uh yes through business yeah  would you call them friends of yours  uhm word associates mostly  like i didn't i'd see them at conventions  had you uh had you decided as a group that you would golf together at this tournament  uhm i don't know how they decided that cos i was late  cos i was working that morning  and so you just we   how did you find out who you were signed up to play with  when i got there  like they had could be have a list up that you read  yeah yeah  the word secretary yeah  and it so happened that you knew the people that you  were gonna going to be golfing with  yeah   yeah i know most of them  cos i been in the business   you know most of the realtors  yeah  okay  and uhm did you start with lunch at jack's   that's right  three words lunch with the person  yeah  were you meeting some people there or did they have a buffet of some kind  no they didn't have a buffet for lunch uh but uh everybody lunch was on your own but everybody was having lunch  so who did you join  like you were saying that you were late  uhm i was with some metropolis people and also the table next to ours was uh my foursome  kay okay and uhm did you consume some alcohol at lunch  yeah we had a coupla couple of beer  cos the rest of the day was done  what do you mean the rest of the day was done  well for for work  oh i see you weren't you weren't  working anymore so you were now socializing is that what you mean  sure  and so you had a couple of beer  mm hmm  do you know exactly how much you had to drink at  two beers  two beers  yeah  and uh did the rest of your party that you would be golfing with later do you know whether they had anything to drink as well  i'm not sure  you were not sitting with them  no  okay  uh did you have any other alcohol to drink over the course of the afternoon  uhm a coupla couple of beer throughout the the game  and uh under what circumstances did you do that  are you able to drink while you're actually golfing  yeah  and how does that work  does somebody come around serving alcohol  uh then they didn't  we had to we went to uh once we went around   the first time uh we stopped at the little confe  confectionery and we picked up some beer from there  and uh so when you were close enough you would   you would get  yeah  do you know how many times you did that  uh well i had a coupla couple of  beer throughout the game so maybe twice  and uh so and yeah what time were you planning to be finished your game  what time did you guys think you'd be done  well usually it's uh uh eighteen holes but texas scramble is a little faster than an ordinary game because you bring up the balls to the best shot and uh probably anywhere from four to five hours five and half hours  but so you played the game  i'm asking you you know what time was it that you got done  when did you finish at  five thirty  cough so at the time that this whole incident happened within the word you had been drinking all through it   yeah well yeah i think so  and uh did you uhm did anybody  approach you or advise you that the the the problems or that  jane had felt there was a problem  actually when after the game when i   put my equipment away and i changed my shoes and so on i went back  to for the banquet which started at six  six thirty  that's when harley harley li came up to me and says you know uh there's been a complaint about you on the golf course  and uh that's where he says you know just and i said well  let's you know let's talk about it and he says no let's just forget it and uh uh better leave he said   that would be for the   so that's what you did  yeah  so i gather that you must have been quite confused at that point  i was uhm embarrassed yeah  so the other people who that you were golfing with did they know what had happened that you were  ha that you were were they nearby or did you tell them  i didn't have a chance to talk to them  i was actually embarrassed  and you left  that's right  so you don't know whether the rest of your uh group found out  no  about you don't know anything about that  no  now uhm during the course of the uhm the day that that you described uhm are you able to tell us whether or not at that point the people that you were golfing with whether or not they were drinking  were they also  well we had a again we had a   coupla couple of drinks yeah  they were  i'm asking you if you word   same same same yeah  okay pause about 15 seconds   now uh you say that you uh that you uh   are good with faces but i gather the first time that uh jane  came round you didn't recognize her  no  and uh and the second time   that that she came by or the time that   that two or three words are talking about uh again you didn't recognize her after she'd used your name  after she said pierre then i i i  looked at her and i thought oh i i   kinda kind of know her maybe and so i went up to her and we started talking and that's where it all came back to me  okay now when you went up to her and started talking to her uhh exactly what did you talk about  basically whoville about the whoville  and i told her i was engaged uh talked to her to see if sh  to see if she was still going out with uh  mi uh his name is mi mike   mike uh i dunno don't know  his last name simpson   and uh uhm when you were you were standing by her cart while she was sitting in it and you were drinking with her  that's right  she didn't get out of her cart at that point   no  and you say the other the other  people that you were golfing with were also there  yes  frank and mark and steve  were nearby as well  yeah   mm hmm  was is it possible that someone was purchasing something from her something to drink at that time  or or you just didn't see anything like that happen  no  no  you don't know  no i don't know  okay  uh so the other people that you were with would have been around for the rest of that conversation  yes pause about 12 seconds   and uh uhm how much time did you actually spend talking to her   not very long because we had just like i said we had just shot uhm our we just drove our balls and that's putting the club away then i went and talked to her and then those guys finished putting their clubs away and then  that's they took off and then that's when i asked her for a ride  did they tell you that they were leaving  yeah we're outta out of here  is there a reason why they left without you  they were probably bugging   i dunno don't know   they left   you're and uh it's your evidence  that uh that jane agreed to give you a ride  that's right  i wouldna wouldn't have went on the cart if she woulda would have told me no pause about 15 seconds   i gather that during the once that you you say you drove to this other spot i gather that once you were there you were close to where jane was the whole time that she was at that location  yeah  is that right  yeah  so anything that happened in relation to her you would have observed  i thought i did  well perhaps you could you could  just be clear for us  is there some way you could have missed something that happened  well mind you there's we  weren't concentrating on her  like we were golfing uhm  may like the conversation with  frank lawson i didn't uh i didn't hear or overhear anything of that kind so  so uhm so i guess  what uh is what you're saying is that when you got to the spot you got up and left and went to actually golf on the course  well i went back to my cart wasn't far like it was right beside basically on the right hand side so i just basically went there uhm check my club which club i'm gonna going to   use   that's what we do when we golf  so you left whe you got off of   her cart went over to to your cart  mm hmm  and you were looking at your golf equipment  mm hmm  and that you say it's during that  time frame that that frank had some sort of a conversation with jane   i yeah  and you're saying that you were unable to hear that  no  now was there a reason why you couldn't hear what the conversation was about  i wasn't paying attention  what were you paying attention to  golfing  well what do you mean by that word   well i was thinking of what my next shot and what my next uh club i'm gonna going to use   there's fifteen other clubs so i was trying to figure out which club i was gonna going to use  so you were standing looking at your golf cart clubs and thinking  is that what you're saying  yeah  and that's why you couldn't hear what   what was going on  that's right pause about 10 seconds   and then you say you went back to where jane was  that's right  back to her cart  why did you do that   to see what was going on  i don't know i just went back clears throat   well when you looked when you looked   at her cart what was going on  who was there  what was happening  when i got there she was standing and that's where   i i said oh another hug  so i gave another hug and that's when i hugged her again  okay well i'll just stop you there  if you look back she was standing  where was frank   right by his cart  so he was no longer talking to her  uhh no
