 i don't know  lakehead  lakehead yeah   laugh that's where everybody's going  lakehead university   lakehead   ya laugh   i'll get a pair of mukluks a traditional innuit boot  and a lumber jacket  no i i mean i'd much  ra rather it would make infinite more sense  to to be able to go to ottawa u  university   uhm  i want ottawa u to start a midwifery program  oh ya  well they've been talking about it for three years  i'm in there  i'm takin taking it  i don't care if i'm fifty-six years old by the time i get in   well have you spoken laugh   have you spoken to anyone in the uhm at the school of the  mid midwives  uh mid midwives  uh uh   last year i did   midwi midwives   ontario college of midwives   ya  no   that was on my list of things to do  oh   well isn't there anywhere   ya  ah not lakehead but sudbury or  somewhere in texas you said  something weird like that   well that's an american program and this is where hermione 's friend eileen went down and lived  and and apprenticed and came back full-blown  super-midwife  right   uh is she working  ya ya   great   in fact she's got a clinic in toronto and she went down with her kids and  she went down with two kids and came back with three or something  hmm   laugh   but this is the big movement down there because of the  uh uh the closeness to the mexican border and they work with a lot of indigents and  oh okay   wow  well so anyway i've gotta got to  really sort it out because they're non e  there's this other dramatic ur  urge sort of yearning is to sort of ditch it all and uh go to theatre school   no way  laugh ya  which is the other thing i wanted to do way back when  i've always wanted to do that and yet i've been really sort of  afraid of it but uhm   so do it a little bit  well i know  and that's what i keep thinking just do it a little bit  do a little of this do a little of that  but i was thinking no if i was gonna going to   do it i'd just sell all my furniture and everything i have and try to go to rada royal academy of dramatic arts or something in  england   ya   like just hurl myself into it  well w   okay what what experience do you have in the theatre so far   uhm when i was in france i did theatre when i was at school   did you   ya ya it was like french language and theatre  and uh i had to do it like in french which was pretty fun  we did a couple of plays  and did you love love love it  i love love loved it  oh ya  that's what being working in a restaurant is  it's just being on stage   ya this is why i fuck laugh you know   it's being on stage  and that's why working at the museum is so easy  ya   like i have no problem just marching in and talking to a room full of people who are like i have to convince   well you are theatrical   ya   you know   uhm and what else did i do  i did a lot of stuff when i was a kid uhm   at ah at uhm   around the class   ya   at school   ya i did a lot of stuff around the school and uh   did they streamline you into like  like we had to take drama band or art  one or the other laugh   ya and i took drama and art   di   ya  oh okay   ya   cos i could only take drama  you couldn't take art  no  why not   oh no co no   you just you picked your you went into  secretarial vocational which was electrician  and uhm academic   oh christ   laugh hallsweepers   ya well i was in a would've been in an  academic stream  oh ya and then o once  you're in academic at the age of fifteen they ask you what i don't even no " know" discipline i suppose they'd call it you would go into  and there was no switching in between  there was certainly no combining of them  i know and that's really aw  awful   and hermione was in band   band  ya  hermione   ya   that's so weird  oh ya   what'd she play at   clarinet   clarinet and flute   oh my god you're kidding   second flute  she's very good on the clarinet  oh ya  ya  isn't that wild  i never knew she played an instrument  she could still pick it up and play  ya well but she wa  was this was band  that's so cool   this was this huge forty  you know you played your part   in the band   ya   what did you do   and i was in drama  drama  drama  laugh   i was the uhm i was the   cheshire cat  laugh   laugh i can't even remember the other stuff i was in   oh god  there's so many missed opportunities there though  because somebody nobody has ever and i always do this whining thing but if somebody had put a paintbrush in my hand  and acrylic paints in grade ten and said  cool laugh you know i would be in a whole different place right now  i know   ya exactly   yup  i mean it's pathetic that at thirty-two you pick up a paintbrush and say this feels great  laugh this is fun  ya  yup  no it is  it it all it's there's something not quite right about the way we educate kids and i'm not entirely sure what  you're supposed to do about it   but uhm i just uh y i w  i would really  i think you should look at what you wanna  want to produce and you should ask people who are really  sort of centred and and whole  people what  it is that got them there  mhh hmm   ya   cos it's not high school laugh   no it's not  it's not high school at all   laugh   high school is just the high school's this fallacy   and and ironically i had this long conversation with gary about tommy and said don't sweat high school on this kid  i said gary you of all the people after all your years teaching high school should know this what is   well six years and grade thirteen's gone so maybe if laugh tommy can  just hang on   wha what   exactly   if you hang in   what's he in   is he in twelve  ya no he's he's doing uhm uhh o a cs unfamiliar reference and uhh i think grade twelve at the same time  he's got half and halfs cos like he screws around a bit and doesn't always get his marks  so   so he hates it   oh ya school is just a big complete pain to him  he should and i said so finally he's   gary 's at the point now where he's really  uhm stressing or giving t  tommy options like canada world youth uhm going out into the world don't worry about university  fuller brush salesman   just   ya laugh well ya fuller brush salesman  laugh   just go out there  and i've spent like months talking to gary and saying  don't anticipate university for this kid  let him go  he he let him go and learn   don't let him sit in the house when he finishes school  and just like a bump on a log   ya  it's if you live here you work  if you don't wanna want to do that than you get out there and here are here's all  these opportunities  go dig water wells in the sub-sahara  well the killer is that gary has access to these programs  exactly   he's aware of them  absolutely   he can go and live on jacques cousteau's  boat  i know  he can do all that really neat stuff   exactly  and that's exactly what tommy needs   he needs to   well is he is he  legitimately bored   ya he's legitimately bored and he's  he's just a bit aimless  i mean he's had a couple a few years of real weirdness going on in his life   ya  and uh uh the whole situation between gary and i has thrown him once again as being once again in the middle of something   really   ya well what can you do to help him with that   he was here he is in the middle   well just  leave him alone  leave him alone and disassociate myself from his father  which is what i've done  which is what i word do   what's it like when you see him now  i haven't seen him since saturday  i didn't go i i   decided not to work on sunday obviously because he was gonna going to be there and i just felt he needed some space and i  needed some space   ya   ya well i was pulling you over the coals about that too   ya yup yup ya you were  uh so i'll i'll maybe see him on sunday  maybe not   well it do you think he's upset about it  do you think it's a pain in the butt for him  do you think  i think he's got just enough of his father in him that he's just tunnel-visioned  he doesn't worry about his mom and his father  he doesn't worry about me and his father  he's just   well he's a if he's a normal    like i'm trying to think how i would react at seventeen though  he's just living his own life   you don't c care   well he's eighteen   you don't really care about adults  like you don't your whole life   two words anymore   no but i mean he had   no he had stuff going with you  he related with you on things and  stuff but i don't think he had a dependency on you  oh ya   two words i know   i don't think i don't think you've threatened the security of his life  no no  no dependency   no no not at all  i don't   no  no of course not  uhm there's definitely a  no he knows that i'm always available to him   that uh that i wasn't just being his pal like his friend just because i was you know  cos you had to walk by him in the living room  ya  ya  but the you know i was more genuine than that  but what else does he have access to   phrase   not very many except for uhm uh one friend of theirs uhm  uh what's her name tori uh tori   this is an adult who's who has   known tommy all  her all his life   ya   oh ya oh ya   and he will often go over and uhm and talk to her  or if he is at their house then he'll uhm sort of find a way to separate himself from the kids and go he'll have a chat with her at times  oh well that's good  that's that's all   ya you get i  think in this  ya   ya   that's good  ya  so he has access to someone who is impartial that he can just sound off on  ya  ya  ya tori james that's it  i don't think   ohh   the james'   ya ryan james is uh gary' s lawyer  oh  ya  no i i don't think you ever walked into tommy 's house and said i'm gonna going to be your new mommy or anything  oh god no   i would i wouldn't  worry about any responsibility with tommy   a aside aside from you like him  no no no   ya   ya   i mean i i feel sorry  i mean i just feel shitty about the way things went but oh well   but   i don't know tommy 's got lots of other things like condoms to worry about  laugh and who stole his father's c d player  no   he w   ya gary bought a c d player and had it for about two weeks and tommy had a party and the   w week the week after like a few days after the party uh of course tommy can never remember to lock the door to the house a few days after  the word   tommy had a party laugh   he wasn't in on it was he  i don't think he was in on it  no i don't believe so  but uhm a few day not " days"   and of course tommy never locks the door and all the rats in the neighbourhood know that like usually the door's open at branson  's
