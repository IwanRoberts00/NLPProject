 ya  mary won't have a slip  she's too little  but uh she might have some cap sleeves but  the the the dresses are  pencil thin straight down with a little slit   quite a big slit as a matter of fact  uhm and mel 's dress is almost exactly the same only it's white and it has ah kind of a thing on the shoulders to make it look like a bride  so how may bridesmaids is she gonna going to  have   seven   my gosh  isn't that awful  i know  vulgar almost  oh my god   but uhm   and are the boys all ushers  yup   well that's gonna going to be really a family affair  mhh hmm  and uh   did you go to the church  i've been to the church  ya  mhh hmm  and i went back to the club and looked at that again  and i i think i might get this woman to make me a dress too   e even though i'm not young and slim  well i'm slim now since i lost all this weight so   since the surgery  but uhm she had some quite interesting things there  now the day we did the dressmaker was the day that mary-alice  plank had taken us to lunch so she came  along as well with lots to say about a lot of things as  mary-alice   always does   mhh hmm   no doubt   but uhm i think that's fun  she's incidently in turkey now on a cruise  oh  tough eh  not with the not with the man that she was supposed to go last time that she two words    no no no she's trying to get her money back from  that fiasco  an escort or something  mhh mhh mhh mhh  laugh she didn't do that  uhm okay now i just wanted to talk to you about uhm the florist  i went to see her  she was recommended by the westmount florist  up there  ya   it's called fiore and it's on st clair between bathurst and christie ah and she's certainly a designer as well  i like very much her her ideas and  thoughts  now she'd like to do   you mean designer of of  arrangements   of floral things   floral arrangements ya  ya decor  okay  ambience  anyway so for the church we'll have uh two big candelabra at the front uh decorated with uh bows and greenery christmas greenery and berries and uhm ivory coloured roses  mhh hmm   i think it'll be just gorgeous  mhh hmm  and we'll have the the pew uhm markers with green and greenery and uh these red  this colour almost uhh brocade bows  mhh hmm  everything costs by unit  then in the at the club there's this  you know there'll be an artist well just like the one here  well you've been there enough  uh they have the big room with kind of goldy uh walls and we thought we'd put these red brocade tablecloths with gold trim and gold candelabras on each one  cos you know how mel loves candlelight   mhh hmm mhh hmm  decorated with uh the same theme as the uh church thing  but it's gonna going to be a  a word   i figured that the flowers are going to be   that that that was what you said was gonna going to be our   our share of the   ya we're doing we're doing   the flowers and the dress  flowers   mel 's dress my dress and scott 's  but that's   and then a few other things of course  but basically that's it  mhh hmm  uhm she's looking at probably they're going to ask ohh two hundred i think and they expect they'll get about a hundred and sixty  guests  mhh hmm  ya  well it includes c uh family   ya  which is quite a lot of em them   you suppose tim is gonna going to  make it to that one  no tim has given up on the family  this was his last gasp according to uh what brian said  really  mhh hm  did mina get brian by the way  did she say she got him  yes she said she did  good i'm glad  ya   that's good  i'm glad   ya   uhm so i had a couple questions i wanted to ask her  to do one the white uhm runner thing at the church   down the aisle   yup   you always get crinkles and exhale   but anyway that's fine   she wants that  that's fine  it's only a hundred bucks  to rent it  to rent it laugh   ya right  everything's rented  boy they make a killing on that  i don't know what the flowers are but like  but i got the prices for all the stuff   now i showed mary uh i've shown her uhm a pattern for her dress and   is is she  gonna going to have her dress made down in  she's gonna going to  have be   no this woman's gonna going to   do em them all   and mary doesn't have to go in for a fitting or anything  we have to get the measurements  and i've given her mina 's  so everybody has word   huh  so c sh can she do like minor adjustments uhh when we go down there before the wedding  itself   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   she's very much on deck  now the catch with the florist is that the decorations in the church uh er is some of them are going to have to be moved to the uhm reception and we'll have to get trucks or boys or somebody to help us  with some of those things   mhh hmm   i've seen people do that   they do it in just station wagons if they have them or  ya ya   well ryan has a van  so we could use that one   ya that's right  he does   and uhm who else has a van  don't know  maybe get the stevens to bring their van and we could borrow that one  trade with   i'm i'm sure brian wouldn't mind doing that  i think he'd be quite pleased to do something useful  don't you   he's quite good  i'll i'll ask him  they're definitely coming  they're arranged to come   uhm but no i think it's gonna going to   be lovely  and that's gonna going to be  the the colours  this colour and ivory and and gold  and green  that's good   it's great for that time of year  but lots and lots and lots of candles   in the church and in the in the p and r  mhh hmm  and uh no i think it's gonna going to  be really very pretty and very melanie   ya not overdone  mhh hmm   mhhh   laugh   ahh ah it's well it's new year's eve after all  ya right   it's it's not laugh  it's not going to be vulgar  i will not let it be vulgar  i promise  ya her mother would be into that if it were  uh i don't think it will be  it will be really really nice  uhm i'm not going to go for the gold uh napkins  we can use white ones  mhh hmm  because the club provides them  they're probably four dollars and kind of   each to rent or something  i forget that   and i'm not going to go for the chairs she wanted   but i think we'll use the uh the  tablecloths   what do you mean chairs  the   oh she'd rent you gold chairs to go with her whole thing   oh my gosh   no i know  it's what a what a   racket huh  something for a girl who was gonna going to  elope isn't it  it well some so ya right   that'll be the day  now the club will also be decorated  it'll have fires on so we have to do the fireplaces  it's gonna going to be lovely  we have time  ya   the nice thing thing is we have some time to do it before  you mean going down there before again  i i mean you're going to have to go down there   i'm going to have to go down twice more   and then christmas  ya   i think  from what i can see   now i'm planning to go that week and i wondered if you would be interested in coming  that week in october when the baby's due  which is when  the baby's due on the twenty-first   i uh won't have my maybe three words  cough   it's it well we have to be back for the referendum obviously   well that's for sure  uh and we want to be back for the massey 's do  so maybe we can come back on the saturday or the friday night  uh uh i'd have to be here for sunday anyway   yes for sure  well i know that  but we phrase   ya well that sounds alright  i d don't i don't think i i don't have anything on that uh  week i don't think  well you could just check and see   ya i will   i mean my book's up  uhh i haven't got my book here  now the invitations are going out i'll have to check with mel but i think this week  and and i'll  really   oh ya  isn't that awfully early  no  not at not being at christmastime and people having to plan  i don't think  certainly the out of town ones oughta ought to  go   that's what we could do is do the out of town ones first  but i'm not allowed to address any of the envelopes  she's gotta got to do it herself  i'm not allowed cos they'll never get them   oh the writing huh   laugh right  ya i'll bet   they're / - > they're all teasing  peg said she'd do some and whatever  mhh hmm   but if we get the out of town ones done that would be good i think   so people can plan ahead  now mhh i think what we oughta ought to   do is   we're going to be staying with at  ron 's house  they're going to barbados from word   ronnie jones   no ron and ron  and annie cobb   oh   oh  we have their flat if we want it  oh really  okay  okay  until the twenty whatever day thirtieth   then i think we oughta ought to get a suite in a hotel and have mel with us and mina and  mary the last the night before the wedding  okay  well we   ya and then the girls can all come there and get dressed in there and uh get their hairs not 'hair' done there  and w and whatever in the morning  well we better book that very well ahead over that  weekend   yes that's what i think  i want i was gonna  going to do it last week and i thought well that maybe something you'd like to do   park plaza would be good cos it's right off the street from  mel   ya  four seasons would be good   so there'd be there'd be   you and me a and   mina mel and mary   and we could what we could get is two double rooms  mina mel and mary   cough   okay with a i would suggest that we get two double rooms with a sitting room  ya   and we'd just need it for two nights   okay   and that's close to where we're going to be  is it   alright  then we'll   either one  either the four seasons or the park plaza   we would need that for before the wedding  and for   we'd we'd need that ya  we'd need that uhm   and and where about  the night of of   i mean the night after  we need it for the night before the wedding and the night of the wedding and then then we're going to come home  cough   aren't we  or we could go to ron 's that last night huh  laugh depending depending  how we are   i would expect we'd drive back on uh new year's day  late-ish   this will be pretty   new year's day   or maybe we'd want to stay one more day  we might want to   mina won't  she'll want to go right back   i must get   ya   i can i can always send her back with grandma jeanette   cos they're coming down  well why couldn't she go with jennifer and james  she could do  ya   but you and i might want to take an e  extra day  ya  i see  well we just need one of those rooms
