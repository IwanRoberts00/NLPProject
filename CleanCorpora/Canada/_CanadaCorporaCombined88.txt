 and get things done ya   ya   so i've yet to do that type of wedding traditional wedding  mhh hmm   and i have a lot of friends  hope to do it maybe in i don't know new hampshire maine or vermont  some place where it's like a little wild a little old  fashioned   some place you know   mhh hmm   like maybe at mandy and les' on the mountain or something  ya that sounds nice  ya   ya   i wouldn't mind meeting them  randy used to call all the time  ya   i'd like to meet him  laugh well he a couple words  i'll write it down   oh i have their new phone number up there   where   they moved to alabama  oh did they  ya so i don't get a chance to see him when i go down there   so is he still making his uh uhh  sauce   sauce stuff   the hot chilli   they're still they're still  they're still doing a bit of that but he's working as a bouncer right now for a night club to support things until they get you know on their feet down there  and get going   mhh hmm   right ya   it's like it's it's difficult for them you know   they're a young couple  that's what uhh toby was telling me  uhm he was in uhm he went down near  timmins some place and he went in on reserve  one of the girls he's taking the course with  she's on a reserve there  mhh hmm   and uh he said they are so poor mom  like uh he said you know i maybe two words  log cabins  that's what they live in  that's their permanent homes like   they don't have the same   huh   i never found those too bad and actually i prefer them to the houses  well uhm ya we could have jumped up a little too fast and   got rid of a lot things  mhh   and uh maybe we went about it the wrong way  i don't know  because like  those would have been alright for the young couples  they w they would have enjoyed those  ya  and and the other thing too is it's the transitional phases  and   right  because like one of the things is i was talking to  one one of the guys and he said this was uhh   he said like he found one of the biggest problems with the house was is like traditionally he lives in a tent end of tape   but it's your system and you know how it works and you're comfortable with that and if somebody changes that  then if someone was to call looking for information things wouldn't be at your finger tips and and they wouldn't be where you left them  mhh hmm   and that's a very frustrating feeling cos you wanna  want to feel that you're in control and that  you're efficient and organized  mhh hmm   but you can't be if people have gone through your things and moved them to what they think is a better location  that's it   here in this office uh amanda uh felt that uhm  i i uh i suggested to her that i would speak to wanda about the office set up and where  i thought things should go because we had to advise the electricians which plugs we were using for the phones and which plugs we were using for the computers and that kind of thing   mhh hmm   so uhm and and she wasn't around at the time  so i went ahead and did that and suggested to her that this is how i saw it but that if she saw things differently that she should let them know as quickly as possible  and it's worked out well cos she agreed that that would probably be the best set-up and we haven't changed very much  the only thing is when dick left and larry  came in we acquired more files and we needed an additional bookcase  and and then where were we going to put it  mhh hmm   and so we had to send back a table and order something else  so there was some rearranging that had to be done there  and uh we were told what would be the best place for it and how to put it  uhm and uhm and and it was brought into the office that way and amanda quickly reorganized laugh  it into the way that she wanted it   mhh hmm sure  it's her space  i think she has to feel comfortable with it  that's it  i try not to close the door cos she gets no natural light at all except what comes through this door if the door's closed  mhh hmm   so i try to keep my door open all the time  mhh hmm  so she has a sense of the outdoors  mhh hmm  it's important  mhh hmm  and i   uhm unfortunately plants don't do as well in there as they do by the window here  so we keep trying to rotate the plants and put plants in there that we feel are going to make her feel that there's a sense of life  cos if you if if you're  working in an environment like that where there's no window very little daylight uhm you start to feel  i think it's w it would be a very depresing feeling  so we got two plants in there right now that are doing really well  mhh hmm  ya they like this kind of light  ya  we had another plant in there but it really liked the daylight so  we gave that one to larry   so he's got one in his office now   mhh hmm   well i want one of those  mhh hmm  actually i've been wanting a spider plant  did you get the spider plant from there too  ya  they're so nice and healthy those plants   ya i know  and they weren't expensive at all  you have purchased them  it's through a journal transfer  okay  uhm so what you could do is ju uh transfer it   did you carry them over   ya  uh no  we had distribution bring them over  okay   what you could do is have huh you could charge it to your budget and then write a cheque to the  university  yes   okay   and uhm   is that what you did   all of them are the office plants so when i leave i have to leave them unless i choose to purchase them  right so i mean i would basically want to do the same   if it if i was to bring one home i would purchase it or if i were to ever leave the office then i'd have to either do a journal transfer to my other office or purchase them outright  mhh hmm   that's it  but i wouldn't mind having a nice big tree   hmm  he doesn't have too many things that are big  i know  i had hoped that that would be bigger and since it isn't i put it on the radiator to make it look taller   and it's also close to the door  so that when amanda looks out she sees something  green   yes   no it's nice   and i like your mirror  i told you that before  with the wood  uhm   ya my brother gave me that  he didn't want it  oh   they we were in zellers the other day and they were selling park benches you know like the for  thirty bucks  wow  with the wrought iron  they must have been nice   like really heavy   mhh hmm  i wanted to put one in front of my door and in   in the front  like on that side there  mhh hmm   a small little one  well it's a two-seater  hmm  that's nice  i thought it would be  is it really a two-seater or is it a one and a half  did you try and sit in it  it's a actually it's a two and a half  oh that's nice   actually it's thomas  and i and both the kids were sitting in on   it  hmm   and they like squeezed in  uh huh uh huh  ya  you know we coulda could of like we could   oh that's nice   well  so you've been doing some major shopping  we didn't buy it  we were discussing   just looking   we were discussing it   i want it thomas i want it  and we have to buy a new carpet or something for it because it's it's it's awful  that carpet is ripped and  the indoor-outdoor  ya  we're scared of ripping it up  we don't know what's going to be underneath it  so i don't know  we have to have the whole thing word   you have to be prepared whatever you rip up  because there's probably glue  oh i'm sure that  you can see some black sort of spots there  mhh   mhh hmm  so we were going to go with brown carpeting  like a a beigey dark brown  colour that will match the house more  uh huh   can you get indoor-outdoor carpeting that colour  yup   you can get it in two colours green or brown  oh nice   mhh  you used to be able to get it i think in grey or black or something too   ya and you can  you can  but i thought  i don't know   it just didn't seem   it sorta sort of looks   more like an asphalt at that point  ya  it didn't sort of  i like things that go colours that go  together and blend together   mhh hmm   the you can see the   the green you wanna want to  with the grass but it's such an artificial green and it never really meshes with the grass  uh huh  it should be like a forest green rather than a what kind  like that's a golf green   it's like a leprechaun green laugh    ya shamrock laugh   shamrock green exactly   so no forest green would have been better  pool table green laugh   pool table green that's it  that's it  must be from your shark days  yes yes  but   i told you about the opening eh of the  the design art graduates show at the  vernissage took place at sharks in the pool hall and it was it was like stepping into another world  oh ya   have you been to that place  no no  it's in the foire boive   huh   they're interesting clients of laugh   environments aren't they   the the the   vernissage was in the private room at the back which has its own bar and a couple of pool tables  there's two different kinds of pool tables like a smaller one and a larger one  one's called one   snooker and boston  ya  and uh it was interesting actually watching it   i used to play pool a lot  ya   uh well i've played a little bit but nothing to really speak of  but it was fun to watch them play   but to walk in to this place  it's underground  it's in the basement  the ceiling's uh   low   ya  maybe they're not that low but the lighting is  right  the lighting comes down so i think it gives that uh feeling of low ceilings  very dark except for all these lit pool tables  there's smoke you know there's this because of the nightclub kind of atmosphere  and there's music and everybody's sort of playing and they're serious looking and almost gruesome  sounds like a movie  ya it was it was like in another world  i thought oh this has been going on  you know laugh   there was almost an air of toughness  and the vernissage was there  how could you stay   ya because they had the  the show was in the foire boive   was in some of the space which was actually a bar but there was no bar set up  i'll show you it  you know it's on the second floor and it's on the southwest corner  okay  and it was quite interesting  it was on two levels   and they had it displayed  i liked the display but but of course  they know uhh experts you know in display would tell you why it wasn't working  but le uh some of the lighting was quite poor on some of  the the items  mhh hmm
