 the pride of saint john new brunswick heidi hanlon in her quiet unassuming way has arrived at the threshold of curling glory   last night she used a lot of perseverance and some timely shot making to lead her rank to an extra end semi-final victory over curling legend heather houston of thunder bay ontario   this rock made it all delightfully official a nine seven  extra end victory  the hanlon team was moving on into the final  a surprise to some but not to heidi interview with heidi hanlon   heidi knows that the big teams are all gone now except for the one that's waiting in the wings   julie sutton has made the b c champions one of the biggest of all  this exuberant rank is relaxed and looking towards its first ever national final   and julie sutton certainly knows how to win the big one  she's proved that  six years ago she captured her first national junior title then one year later she skipped her rank to a second canadian junior championship and in nineteen eighty-eight julie racked up the first ever world junior women's crown   this is her second appearance in a scott tournament of hearts  her first run at the national title in nineteen eighty-nine in kelowna fell just short   now she's back and the other ranks have been trying to catch up all week   that's how julie likes it   it's all part of the plan interview with julie sutton   one of the prizes could be claimed in albertville france next february where today's winner will represent canada at the sixteenth winter olympic games   momentum will be crucial to get there and the sutton rink has picked up a full head of steam interview with julie sutton   julie sutton like heidi hanlon is looking at her first ever national women's title and sutton has never lost in a championship final  today the hot hands square off in this cold prairie city  from saskatoon it's the tenth edition of the scott tournament of hearts and canada is about to crown a new curling queen   here at saskatchewan place we're just moments away from the opening ceremonies that will precede today's championship game involving british columbia and new brunswick  hi everybody i'm don whittman and pleased to be working again  with two-time world champion don duguid  don the fact that british columbia defeated new brunswick eight two on the first draw of round-robin play will that be a psychological advantage for julie sutton today  i really think so  anytime that you beat uh the opposing team in the final in the round-robin play it is a real advantage and not only that she beat her  handily but uh you know uh hanlon's coming on very strong played a great game last night and i think julie's gonna going to have to be on top of her game  well hanlon had to get some inspiration from the fact that she came from behind to defeat a former world champion heather houston last night in the semi-final  well it looked like she was gonna going to  get blown out early don but she hung in there made some great shots to keep her team in the game  her percentages weren't that high but she played excellent in the eighth and ninth end and that won her the game so you know uh she's playing strong and it's going to be a great great game  this is the tenth anniversary of the scott tournament of hearts and this year's event in saskatoon has some fond memories for  another member of our broadcast crew who won the very first scott tournament of hearts in regina sound clip of colleen jones winning   a little more subdued on this visit to saskatoon than she was ten years ago  colleen nice to have you working with us again  you got off to a great start in this year's championship winning your first three but then you had some problems but you're down at ice level and you're going to tell us what these  ladies are thinking and uh what the competition will be like   well the   well i tell ya you  they're really nervous but talking to both skips just moments ago they're really confident and uh both teams are are  planning on winning this thing  they're they're terrific teams  julie sutton plays very very wide open and on this kind of ice it seems to be the strategy that works the best  heidi hanlon though is willing to mix it up  we saw it last night against heather houston  she's willing to put rocks in play and gamble and go for it and she's coming up with the right shots at the right time  the ice has been a factor all week  it's treacherous but certainly this sheet that w they're playing on it curls more than any of the others so i think we will be able to see a few rocks in play  don  b c with a record of ten and one during the week  new brunswick with a record of eight and three  british columbia with the buy yesterday of course and new brunswick had to await two tie-breaking games before  determining that they would face ontario in the semi-final  at this time we welcome other stations along the network that have just joined us for our live coverage of the scott tournament of hearts championship game from saskatchewan place in saskatoon  the opening ceremonies where the two competing teams will be introduced just about to get under way  during the course of the week crowds have been very large here at saskatchewan place  as a matter of fact an attendance record for this event has been established  better than seventy thousand spectators have taken in proceedings and they're looking for close to four to five thousand to  watch this championship game  the two competing ranks british columbia and new brunswick  now being piped into saskatchewan place   heidi hanlon three times in the past has been a competitor   and this is the most successful performance of the scott tournament of hearts for heidi hanlon and her new brunswick crew   they of course would like to cap it all with a victory today but julie sutton of british columbia has some ideas of her own   julie sutton has never lost in a championship game in a zone playdown in a provincial playdown or in a national or world final  she of course the nineteen eighty-eight world junior champion  well if you're heidi hanlon that's pretty frightening you know  i mean here you are in a final and this uh uhm julie sutton hasn't lost a final it's it's pretty scary  game announcer, crowd cheering and national anthem   well i'm sure don duguid that uh there are butterflies in the stomachs of all ten women down on the ice  the four who will be playing and the fifth player and in instances coaches  yes you're very very nervous right at the start of a game but you get in the hack throw the first rock or brush the first rock you   kinda kind of lose the butterflies and get into the flow of the game but before you start you are very very nervous  elaine jackson who is the fifth player and the coach of the b c team was of course a member of the championship squad that won the world title a couple of years back in chicago  and heidi hanlon has as her fifth player her mother ellen brenner who has been a longtime new brunswick competitor and a rival on the curling ice in the province of new brunswick over the years and  is the fifth member of this new brunswick team  well a great steadying influence to have your mother not only as your coach but she's there with you all the time i think that's super  last night it looked as though the new brunswick women were going in to be in serious trouble against  two-time canadian champion heather houston of thunder bay  it seemed on the first three ends that every time she went to throw heidi hanlon was looking at three or four ontario stones  she managed to persevere and then on the eighth end cracked a big three to uh take the lead  stole another one on the ninth for a two point lead heading home  some thought that perhaps her chances of advancing to the final  disappeared when she whiffed a wide open takeout on the tenth end to enable ontario to pick up a pair and tie the match but she came back and she was right on target with her final stone at the extra end  well now it wasn't an easy hit  it looked fairly easy don you know it was on the in-turn side  and uh any time you're throwing away out towards the boards it's uh not an easy hit and she just threw it just beautifully and made great contact with it  uh but you know the early part of that game they really struggled and i thought uh maybe heather houston might get away from them  but they hung in there as you have to do  you can't can never give up in a curling game never ever no matter if you're four or five down  b c will have the advantage of last rock on this opening end  as mary harding gets this championship game started   she has only been curling for six years   didn't take up the sport until she was thirty years of age  mary replaces uh heidi's original lead judy blanchard who had a baby on december twenty-fourth but judy blanchard is uh home in new brunswick watching anxiously and she's played for heidi for years and years  she has been in almost daily contact with the new brunswick rink offering words of encouragement   well you know the responsibility of the lead of course is to always put the rock where the skip wants it but in this case uh heidi hanlon said no mary we wanna want to get the first rock in so i can see uh how keen it is and whether it's changed from our practice session and if it's gonna going to change in direction or movement a bit  so uh she threw it right in there and that's uh a  g a good responsibility of the lead to make sure that you're up and in the rings the very first down  karri willms who is a uh history of arts student at the university of victoria removed that new brunswick stone  and now mary harding the new brunswick lead is again being asked to play in a stone at the top of the twelve foot  you were talking about the perseverance of this heidi hanlon rink and i know that playing against them a lot in the maritimes they never ever give up  they're always there and they never panic  you'll see some teams they'll get down a couple of points and panic and start throwing badly but not this team   they have a lot of character  mary harding's stone coming to rest a little deeper than skip heidi hanlon really wanted  so now julie sutton is asking for a hit on this stone from her lead karri williams uh willms   uh you can see from the ice that julie sutton has given karri that there is very little movement to the rock  she put the brush right on the edge of the rock so it means it runs very very straight with takeout weight  karri was telling me that she was absolutely thrilled to be asked to play uh with the sutton girls at the beginning of the year  she travelled throughout europe last year and she was so excited to get back into the game especially at this level   members of the sutton rink were taking a look at that stone just to the uh left of the sheet of ice to see whether or not it was a biter but uh on our overhead camera we saw it was just outside the rings  b c a lie in one and sherri stewart of new brunswick second is attempting the removal of that stone  they'll have to sweep it to catch a corner of it
