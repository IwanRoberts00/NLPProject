 but he said i think i'm gonna going to   have sunburned eyeballs laugh   laugh   he was so funny  i th think   i think that's what would happen to me too   ya   ya he was a neat old guy  just uhm working with these cree indians the past few weeks they were telling me a bit about their hunting experiences you know  some of them have hunted bear caribou beaver you know  mhh   and uh and i tried to figure out the biggest thing that i'd ever killed and it's probably a mosquito laugh or something like that   ya me too  ya   ya i'm not big on on huntin  hunting   i i think i'd la   rather take pictures of em them   uh i don't mind eating things so i i   guess in theory i shouldn't mind killing things either   mhh no let somebody else do it laugh    laugh   one of my fr friends   well anne radfield who was a coordinator in   your year she uh she  decided to be a quasi-vegetarian  oh ya  mhh hmm   she would only eat things she thought she could slaughter herself  oh ya   otherwise she thought it'd be  well that would put me on a real limited diet  laugh   well she ate chicken but she kinda   kind of cut out the beef and pork which kind of made sense  ya   uhm ya  and i think i would end up uh   even when i go fishing i find it difficult  i like somebody else to do the kill   you know when you gotta have got to   hit em them on the head   oh ya you hit them on the head ya   ya   anyways it's not bad if it's small fish but if you are you know into the big salmon they got a baton there that   whap they hit that thing so hard laugh   they're not so big  you think it's got a huge brain and it's working on advanced   calculus   and thinking   why are you killing me  laugh   ya   ya right   or   ya maybe two words so sad   so did you like working with the cree  it was it was interesting  it was / - > uh it was quite a challenge  actually well it was okay laugh   are they an energetic people or uh  uhm it depends on what it is  if it's something they're interested in they're just like everyone else  very eager   but uhm when it came to uh doing school-related stuff which wasn't interesting to a few of them  mhh hmm   i mean they were all coming to study down   south so they had that basic motivation to to  be interested but a couple of the uh a couple of them a couple of the girls that a couple of the young women   were just they seem either really lonely or really  ya   they're really quiet really shy really withdrawn and it was uh it was hard to   to get them to open up  mhh hmm   and in fact we never got two of them to and uh  i'm a i'm a bit worried about how they're  gonna going to do in school  mhh hmm   ya  they have a different concept of time too  like we were supposed to be at the college at nine o'clock in the morning and it's an hour and a half leaving fr  from the door of the bed and breakfast to arrive at the college   and uh by walking and taking a bus and taking the metro and taking another bus  oh ya   it's quite a long time  and uh we got we got to the college once five minutes to nine and i think everyone was horrified at the fact we had arrived early for something   laugh can't have that  so we were late for all the other days  and it took me a bit of t time  it it was a while  before i could adjust myself to to that fact  you know i mean being late is something i don't like doing  really   ya and yet the japanese uh are men in particular are not noted for their punctuality   uhm to be an hour and a half late for a meeting is not unusual  well   i can't image that for a business oriented culture   i know   how can you do that to your clients or something  like that   ya   i don't know   i was quite surprised uhm   i thought that they would be much more uh conscious of  uh protocol   ya ya   being on time you know   ya   but that's uh   to me it's rude to be late   right   you know that cos then you're assuming that the other person's time is valueless   that's exactly right  and uh i i know that's the way i feel if somebody's late for an appointment with me  i i find uh i get really annoyed  and uh i would like to just leave and say well if my time   isn't valuable enough to you then you know i'm  not interested   right   ya that's that's  the exact same way i feel   ya   but uh ya and it's uhm that's a culture that's quite different too because uhm it's very male dominated  and uhm most husbands uhm uh find that it's uh seem to to feel that it's a necessity to leave from work and go to a club or whatever and then come home  later  mhh hmm   like sometimes much later laugh   and and so the wife is waiting with dinner  you know and it's ah two or three words    weren't a lot of these practices started   after after world war two  like they introduced a lot of these modern american business practices and so people were encouraged to   bond with their workmates and do those exercises in the  morning and everything and  uh   that could be   ya   ya that could be ya   ya   which is a shame really because i think a lot of the traditional japanese uh values are really interesting and uh  cough   i like them because they're family values  mhh   mhh hmm  and i think that's why i'm so drawn to them  uhm the family unit is an important thing to them and it always had been to me so i think that's why i i  feel very very close to the kids that i've gotten to know   along there   mhh   how many have you had   ohh i've lost count but probably about fifteen or sixteen  wow  ya  not enough different countries through  uhm we've had uhh norwegian uh swedish japanese  french-canadian  that's a different country right laugh   ya   that's a different culture   that that was that was an experience  it was great because it was our first experience and uh i uhm i felt like i was learning something about my own basic roots because my mom ah and dad were french  right   my father ca came   his family originated in france   hmm   and uhm in fact he still his relatives still  are there  he has ah uhm nephews and nieces and  and on down who have the la pete champagne uhm  company  awright alright   and uh we have pictures of the of the   building and my sisters have been through it when they went over and met the cousins and stuff  mhh hmm   and that was kind of nice  uh so it when noelle came it was uh like learning a little bit about your background and that was that was really neat  which i've never had the opportunity to do  uhm as a kid we spoke french only until i started school and then in when you  went into the eng english schools and the kids would laugh at ya you so you wouldn't speak french  anymore you know  right   right   and uh   was this in the catholic system   word   yes   ya  ya  and so we were encouraged to try to  con keep it up at school  cough   right  and so with my father having passed away my mom was  on her own raising us so that made it a bit difficult to insist on it when everybody else is speaking  english in the family except herself  right   oh ya for sure   so uhm but now of course i'm sorry that we ever let it go  it's too bad  ya i think mom wishes she spoke more japanese too  and wishes that we had learned my sister  and i but  mhh hmm   mhh   so have you ever taken a trip over there  uh once when i was fifteen years old i went with uh dad  and i you arrive at what is it   nari narita airport   narita  mhh hmm  and uh got off the airplane and thought there's a lot of japanese people around here  it really strikes ya right   i bet it does  you've never experienced it before and  it's it's quite a shock  ya   did you feel minor like you were a minority when you were   well uh physically i wasn't  obviously   no but verbally  but verbally i couldn't communicate with them at all  i had this long t uh teenagers  in the late seventies early eighties had long   uh longer   hair right  oh yes   hair   so i i stood out that way   and apparently i was wearing messy canadian clothes that were unironed and everything  and so people like i my cousins were telling me that i was kind of  a sore thumb that way too   laugh   laugh   but it was interesting  ya i found it was  i uh i didn't like eating rice three times a day  my dad loved it  but i i couldn't i couldn't  be bothered  ya   ya   and the bread that they had over there at the time was really atrocious  oh is that right  ya   we didn't have any store bought bread  uhm the families we stayed with had bread machines  oh really   so of course they made their own  ya   that's what you woke up to  the fragrance of home baked bread   well things have changed since i went there laugh way back when   ya laugh   so you're you have family there  ya i've got uhm dad's younger brother   and and two younger sisters are there   and the younger sister has kids so  oh ya  two of my cousins have come to study in canada  to study english  and uh they were pretty funny  they you know they were typical japanese young people wearing these t-shirts with these really nonsensical english words  laugh   yes   and and you know you'd ask them what does that mean you know  laugh   and they'd say it doesn't mean anything  we just like having english on our clothes okay  so get off our case   laugh   and some of the things that are on there are just really off the wall laugh   cough   oh dear  but they like it  ya ya   wha whatever   it says it doesn't matter  it doesn't matter at all  we were in uh hiroshima i think it was and there were some white guys  i assume they were americans  mhh hmm   so i went up and chatted with them and  after a couple minutes one guy said jeez you speak pretty good english   and i said thanks laugh   laugh   it's pretty funny  ya i i would've liked to have uh gone down to hiroshima but i we just didn't have the time  we spent some time in kyoto and uhm  awright alright   well that's a city to go to  ya it's a beautiful city  and uh we uh decided one morning we were going to walk and see a few things  and we walked and walked and walked and uh finally we found uh uh a spot that we really wanted to one of the things that we wanted to see and uh it was uhm a  a type of department store but uhm  for tourists in that they had englsih speaking uh  clerks as well  awright alright   and uh so when we came out of there bernie said uh we're gonna going to have to take a taxi back to the hotel  i am so tired   laugh   so we got the taxi and within minutes we were back at the hotel
