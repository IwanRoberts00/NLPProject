 that's how she got out there  that's her best chance of getting back  and even though she didn't want to at that point i'd suggest that probably at that point though she didn't wanna  want to go through with what she'd agreed to go through with it's because she 's got nervous with these men that she probably thought her best way out of there was to uhm go through with the uh prostitution agreement get out of there and hopefully nothing would happen   but then when mr lepieu bailed out she gets lost    at that point i suggest that it's a matter for you to decide but i suggest that paddy warbucks  didn't have a chance to leave at that point  very definitely wanted to leave at that point  and from that point on i suggest we have someone that has  could be 'is' been mislead about where they were taking them  that was unlawfully confined from the point at which they took her beyond   toony road   that once she was at that house that she was effectively unlawfully confined  she was assaulted  she was dragged by the hair   and ultimately raped   and ultimately defended herself   that's what the defence suggests was the scenario  sure she agreed that she would uh be involved in prostitution with these men  she didn't agree to being abused  she didn't agree to go to toony   once the agreement was breached there was no longer  three or four words with them  and i suggest that the fact that she took two hundred dollars at that point she was probably looking i suggest at what's the best way out of this problem  first i take the money and so the other way would be   i'll take the money two or three words walk  i'll take it back to name   but the next word that holds clear that uh  hour and a half of uh   she hadn't agreed times two hundred dollars worth of abuse  she didn't agree she didn't laugh around   she agreed to have sex for money and that's all she agreed to  and the one thing that i could see going through one of your minds or perhaps through my learned friend's mind is well  why did she hit him more than two to three times   well in that vein if one pictures the fact that this man was so much larger than her word much stronger than her and her rather isolated feeling out there   the last thing that you want is an enraged violent mean person that you just hurt by hitting him with a hammer him  taking off and coming after you  uhm i suggest that once she decided that her life was in danger  she had no alternative in her mind except put the guy down so he  'd stay down  whether she knew for sure that he would die she certainly intended i suggest to hurt him to a great great word    we two or three words with that   and she felt it was necessary according to her testimony  and she did it  and unless you can be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that that position is not true that's the end of the matter  that   if there's even a possiblity that that's correct uhm she's entitled to be found not guilty  the uhm on that you and the court have to determine her credibility   she was on the witness stand longer than perhaps any other witness   and uh s' it's very hard for us to put ourselves in the place of of someone else and say is she reacting as a truthful witness would   and did she react the way a reasonable person would react  out of word   you can't put yourself into that position  it's very very difficult to that is  to see the world through someone else's eyes  or what would be reasonable force for someone else    how terrified would you be   i don't remember the last time i was terrified  i remember being frightened for a split second word  or startled but i don't remember the last time that i was terrified for half and hour forty-five minutes  word can you  can you picture a time when you were terrified for that long   and so unless you can i suggest you'll great great deal of difficulty imagining what was going through paddy warbucks  's mind as her fear built and built and built when she was abandoned  by mr lepieu with this mean violent man   likewise when she's could be very fast 'she wez' up here on the witness stand trying to recreate that scene and trying to  paint that picture for you people very difficult  i suggest she made an admirable job of it and i suggest that her testimony was truthful and honest   there are things that i suggest as a lawyer that i  word noticed and i'm gonna  going to point out to you but ultimately you'll have to be the judge of whether you thought she was telling the truth but little things like she was asked about whether she borrowed money thirty dollars from uh anna swinton   she said no   and word anna swinton yeah i owe her thirty dollars  well why was that   well i she came in here and sold me rest of utterance   and that doesn't make her look bad  i mean she didn't have to tell you that but she did  tape cuts out   ladies and gentlemen of the jury it is now my responsibility to direct you with respect to the law   and as i mentioned earlier as to the law you must accept  word   but equally definite is your role in judgment of the facts  you and you alone have the responsibility in fact the sole responsibility for determining what are the facts in this case  both counsels for the accused and word  crown counsel have reviewed the facts at some length and that is their responsibility and duty as counsel   but what they have said about the facts based on the evidence can either be accepted by you or rejected by you   it is for you alone to make that determination   now for the purpose of assisting you i'm going to go over some of the evidence as i recollect it   but if you disagree with my recollection of the evidence it is the way that you recollect the evidence and not the way that i recollect it that is important   because i have said previously you are the sole judge of the facts   now nothing and i underline that nothing has been proven in this case until you the members of the jury make a determination that it has been proven   as i go through the evidence i may say that this has been proven  or that has been proven or draw your attention to a certain piece of evidence which i think is two or three words   or i may say that this is a fact or that is a fact  but unless i say to you categorically that this is a matter of law  that i speak then i'm not incorrect in stating that anything has been established because nothing has been established until you the members of the jury have made that decision   i may suggest to you that certain inferences and conclusions can be drawn from the facts so that you will have little difficulty in arriving at a certain conclusion  and i'll be doing that later when i go over the case in  some detail   but in the end it is up for you and you alone as to whether any inference should be drawn or any conclusion should be drawn or if a fact's proven   and you are only to consider the evidence that was presented to you  from the witness box and and nothing else   you are not to consider anything that you may have heard outside the courtroom   the decision on which evidence you accept as credible or worthy of belief is entirely for you to make   and this case that's on the stand is a matter  of determining credibility  it is for you to decide which witnesses and which evidence you accept and which evidence you reject   you may accept a portion of the evidence as i stated in my opening  given by a witness or you may reject it  you may accept parts of it or you e ma   you may reject parts of it   or you may reject all of the evidence two or three words  now an honest witness can sometimes be mistaken   and when a number of different people observe a particular event  and that is especially so when there is a stress involved  people sometimes see things differently   but then differences in evidence may indicate to you  that the witnesses did not get together and manufacture or rehearse the story  you may consider that a healthy sign or in the alternative you may decide that a witness or witnesses are deliberately trying to deceive  that's for you to say if this honest witness may be telling the truth in some part of his or her evidence   you are also entitled to make reasonable deductions and draw reasonable inferences and conclusions from the facts which you accept out of the evidence given in this trial   i must also emphasize the position of an expert witness  and we did have one expert that was involved in this case dr  seuss   an expert is a witness who by reason of special skill and training is able to give opinion evidence within his or her  field   an expert witness who gives his or her opinion is no different  from any other witness as far as your right to accept or reject all or part of the evidence is concerned  you can accept the opinion of the expert but if in your opinion the facts indicate a different result you are to take your opinion and reject the expert opinion   and if on any matter the expert is wrong in your view if you draw a different conclusion than that of the exp   than that of the expert you have the absolute right  to do so  that's the jury's responsibility  you are here because you are presumed to be calm  reasonable and inclement   and this is a case where you should exercise your good old-fashioned common sense   you are entitled to draw from your experiences in life and your associations in life your knowledge of life and that of your fellow  citizens  so what i'm saying is just apply some good old- common  - fashioned fashioned good old-fashioned common sense     it's so important   utterance   now as mentioned by counsel this is a very very important  corner pronounced coroner cornerstone   in our democracy and canadian law that the accused in this case we have three of them come into this court as innocent men   the law presumes them to be innocent as to these charges sorry  i suppose that should be this charge i'm sorry there's only one charge until the charge has been proven by the crown beyond a reasonable doubt   now under our legal system there is absolutely no obligation on the accused to prove their innocence could be 'they're innocent' - - voice lowers   they don't have to prove anything   and there's no ob they did testify in this case but there's no obligation whatsoever for them  to to to go on the stand and tell their stories   the crown must prove each and every ingredient of the offence  necessary to sustain the charge beyond a reasonable doubt   and that burden through the trial never shifts  it's on the crown at the start of the trial throughout the trial and it's on the crown right now   and i said before the crown must establish the guilt of the accused to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt   and those are critical words in this case  counsel four or five words   and in most criminal cases that is the most important aspect  of the case  i'm going to repeat that phrase over and over again in my charge and if sh i should say to your satisfaction and meets your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt   then that then brings us to the question what is a reasonable doubt  what do those words mean   the words reasonable and the word doubt they're ordinary words  we use them in our everyday language and our on our everyday lives   they're not magical or mysterious or mythical so you should give them their ordinary meanings
