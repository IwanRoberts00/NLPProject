 hi  hi mikee how are you laugh   fine  let's go back twenty-nine years if you if you   don't mind and talk about nineteen sixty-five and what made you decide to become a volunteer at the queen e  well i i told the other day and i said i had three teenagers at the time and i wanted to get out and do something that was for me for my just personally for me  laugh   not involved with anybody else  i wa didn't want to be somebody's mother sister brother mother anything laugh   you wanted to be jerry anderson   that's it  so that was my chance  now uh bu but why a why a hospital  some people would would cringe at the thought  there's so much work to be done but uh there are a lot of things you might not want to see  oh well i think uh  i like people very much and uh uh i worked first of all in five east which was a medical floor with many older people and uh  i was pretty good with older people at this   and uh uh now that i'm older i have to  i i'm glad because laugh maybe somebody's going to be good to me  now now what what  what are your duties  i uh i work uh two shifts two days  i work at the information desk uh which i have been at for twenty-four years  mhm  and i work in the admitting office on mondays  and i've been working there for about ten twelve years  before that i i only gave them one day and i was teaching helping in a school  i was teaching children to read  and when that school closed i decided to give the other day back to it  you get another day for them  sure  now you've been around twenty-nine years and i know there are many of your uh colleagues there volunteers who've been there for a number of years too  why do you think people stay around the queen e so much  because it's the best hospital in the city  well that's a simple answer laugh   they have uh it's the community is uh it needs  the community needs it   and uh people are treated like people there  you're not a number  mhm  you're a person  everybody is your friend there  yeah so i guess neighbourhood hospital is a good way to describe it isn't it  oh i think so  yeah in attitude as well  uh you know in there they treat everybody uh the same and uh from the highest uh doctor down to the lowest person everybody is equal uhm  they greet one another like friends and uh  do you know everybody by by their first name  i know a lot laugh   i know a lot laugh   it's a hundred years old  is it it's this year the hundredth anniversary right  that's right  we we've been having celebrations  our volunteer week we had three days of wonderful celebrations  and uh it was uh really uh inspiring to see that we have three hundred volunteers now  boy that is quite a size  and the they do all kinds of jobs which which is saving the government money  mhm laugh get your pitch in there jerry   yeah sure  you're going to have to do a lot of this  uh now you've been around for almost a third of that time  that's right  you must you must know just about well i we we've talked about you knowing everybody  you must about know about everything that goes on in the hospital  all the secrets  well i know  yeah laugh all the secrets yeah  well uhm we're very proud of our hospital and like especially like we have our new emergency which is only eighteen months old and it's just state of the art  it's a wonderful place with a wonderful triage centre  and uh it doesn't uh lose anything to any of the big hospitals  i think we have the best emergency in the city  hmmm  is everybody like you uh over there jerry   oh yes we're all very uh  enthusiastic   up very very up on hospital because it's   we think that it really does a good job in the community  and uh it would be a shame to close it  after all we are the government has  just given us money uh and the go-ahead to have a cat scan  as we speak the uh this construction is going on  and now this is going to go by the boards  i can't see it  well tell me about morale then when you heard about this  first of all i guess it was a kind of a stunned uh more a silence  everybody was like it can't be you know because  they've just remodelled all the hospital and uh it's uh it's  beautiful  yeah   and uh we know that we do such great work in the community that you just couldn't figure we'd be one of the ones that were slated  and especially too we need an english speak   although we have many many french people now  i think i uh i'm using my french  i'm not perfectly bilingual by any means but i have as many french people coming as english now  and uh it's very much needed in the west end you know <[and uh  that's right yeah   and uh closing all the west end ones seems to me uhm i think maybe uh the government might listen  uh   so are people are people  uh ready for uh to get a little frisky about this and  oh i think so  i think we'll get lots of  we have three hundred volunteers that could be out there with petitions and we have all our wonderful staff that will be out there  because they all love the place  and uh your it's really uh i can't say enough about it how the care that they give  now you want to keep the hospital open for another reason  right  oh sure for jerry anderson to  to have a place to go to work laugh uh  laugh but also what happens next year  you get thirty years right  yeah well i if they close it before the spring i won't get my thirty year plaque and i mean i'll be i'll be billing the government for that i guess  well they should tell the premier that  laugh   i'm sure that'll he'll take that into account  your enthusiasm is absolutely infectious  i i gather uh uh each volunteer passes that along to to the others working with them  yeah well i think the government i they should take into consideration we have a wonderful cancer care program  our family medicine unit has a in   well the people from the general came to our hospital for it  to join our family medicine  and uh we have a  people can even get appointments in the evening there  it doesn't have to be if you're a worker that can't get away in the day to see the doctor  there's doctors in the evening there  well jerry i hope it works out for you  oh i hope so too mike and  and   and and maybe we will call you next year and we'll talk to you sitting beside your plaque  who knows  oh good good i hope so  good luck  and thanks for calling  okay  keep your keep up

gotten out the invitations  and i've managed to uh handwrite them with calligraphy for a  i've written about sixty-five so far  cos we have uh i have a fairly big family on my side  and i've there it's half scottish and half french and uh  so getting out the invitations was something else because it's a huge family  how many more have you got  uhm we're gonna going to end up with about a hundred and fifty people at about nine o'clock  cos what we're doing is we're having people over for the reception  you you you're  making out a hundred and fifty invitations by hand  no i'm making out sixty-five by hand  yeah  which are for the people showing up at the reception  and then i'm making out uh invitations where actually i've been putting sticky labels on uh  laugh   for for our friends that will be showing up at nine o'clock  why why would you want to do it by hand  haven't you got enough to do  i have a lot to do but it's  the invitations themselves are very special  yeah i realize yeah   we went   we went to vermont and we found a man who makes handmade paper  mmm hmm  and we bought the handmade paper for from  him and uh made the insides ourselves  actually my fiance made the the you know where it has the the description of the wedding and where it is and the reception at the bottom  but are you up all night writing this stuff  pretty much yes  and thinking i don't even like this person  why am iinviting him or her  wrong  no   i'm inviting the people i want to invite   oh good for you   oh yeah   cos that doesn't often happen you know  i know  that's true  actually i'm i'm lucky  we've decided it's our wedding  and it's nice for people to have their say and we'll listen to them  but it is our wedding so  but the the list has expanded  you said you said before you originally had thirty-five right  yes actually  it was all planned out for thirty-five  we had chosen the uh  it was going to be in a restaurant  it was going to be something very small  um hum  and then what happened was uhm we actually told everybody  well told my grandmother and henry's mom and my gran  my great-aunt at easter  mmm hmm  that's when we started announcing it  and uh my grandmother said oh well you have aunts and uncles that you need to invite because they invited you to their wedding  and she's right and it would be nice to have them there so  we said well granny this is our budget laugh   we're doing this on this budget  so granny said well okay let me help you out a little bit and that way we can invite them  okay so you're happy for that helth help    you don't find it an intrusion  no not at all not at all  uhm at one point   or granny's listening on the radio laugh  and you can't tell me right now laugh   i  uhm it wasn't an intrusion at all   actually it's nice to have my uncles and aunts there because you know you only see them so often  yeah   now i don't wanna want to be  i don't wanna want to be a trouble maker but have there been tensions
