 as the prime minister has pointed out he will be open to suggestions  he will be open to changes   the proposals put forward by the government are just that proposals  and the job of the joint parliamentary committee will not be that of simply selling those proposals or indeed selling the point of view of any one political party but to take these proposals to canadians and to listen to canadians  today the government of canada has put forth its proposals and we have heard those proposals and now we must go forward to hear the people of canada applause, 7 seconds   in the coming months there will be much to say and i'm sure there are things that canadians can agree with in this document but we must also raise questions and issues as well  i and my party are committed to an open process  we have agreed to serve on the parliamentary committee because we believe that there we can help to open up that process a process through which canadians can truly be heard and not just heard but listened to  and a process through which canadians can accept or modify or reject or change or add on to what the government has put forward today  the final outcome must and will reflect the views of all canadians  the constitution cannot be left simply in the hands of politicians but must be the work of the hands and the minds and the heart of the people of canada  let me also say at the outset that we recognize that the are these are tough times for canadians  canadian families have many preoccupations the high unemployment rate the difficulty in a vastly changing world  and it's not easy to think about constitutions and nation building when canadians are worried about jobs and taxes about trying to make ends meet and so this debate has to be made relevant to canadians and it has to be meaningful in the day to day lives of canadians applause, 10 seconds  having said this let us be very clear that the stakes are high   we are talking about whether or not canada will continue to exist as we know it albeit with change  we are talking about holding onto and strengthening a nation that is much admired around the globe   there is no one who has voted for myself certainly or anyone in this party who has given us permission to work to tear this country apart but they have said to us we must work to keep this country together to renew the federation  that is the responsibility i take as the leader of the new democratic party  that is the responsibility that my party assumes and will participate in applause and crowd reaction, 10 seconds   but there are some people mister speaker in all parts of canada who say that it's too late for canada  and to them let me cite the words of a first generation immigrant  who said and i repeat i came here as a guest  rahim balangee writes and canada was generous as it has been to the generations of guests it has accepted and accommodated in its short and glorious history   quote continues   well mister speaker i can only agree with that person who chose this country for many of the values that all of us hold dear because it would be a tragedy mister speaker because we are a nation like no other populated by the first nations a vibrant french-speaking society rich regional cultures people who have come from every corner of this globe who make up the reality of canada in nineteen ninety-one and who work together as we move to the twenty-first century  we are a northern nation mister speaker of great possibilities where citizens and cultures come together  i'm here because i believe in this northern nation  i believe in this possibility  i believe that though we are far from perfect we offer the world an example of tolerance and harmony and yes we can give to the world some hope   we have a responsibility mister speaker to others to ourselves to those who follow to fulfill the promise of canada  i'm here because i believe we can join together to correct the flaws address the injustices and create the best canada we can a canada that all canadians will want to belong to  let me turn then to the proposals put forward today  french, 2 minutes 30 seconds   part of comment missing from audio are delighted to say  the least mister speaker to see the government is looking at the abolition of the present non-elected senate the goal we have held for many many years in this party  one also sees in this document mister speaker movement towards something else my party has long advocated and that is the recognition of the right of aboriginal people to self-government  in this document the government does not address the inherent right to self-government and i would suggest that that must be a major part of the discussion as the committee goes forward applause, 5 seconds   and let me say in this area mister speaker that a fundamental principle must be that aboriginal people must be involved in every way at every stage at every step along the way  the first nations of canada must have a prominent place at the constitutional table  let me say with respect to the division of powers mister speaker that it will take some time to fully study the government's proposals  we are talking about some fundamental changes  the new democratic party is not opposed to change but we feel in each area there must be a rationale for how that change will meet the needs of canadian people   in areas such as immigration and cult  culture for instance i think canadians must be able to see how these changes would in fact directly benefit them because all of these changes will have a profound impact on the future of our nation as a whole and how canada will come to be defined in the twenty-first century  i must restrate restate that the new democratic party believes that a strong canada requires a strong national government  any redistribution of powers that takes place must meet one fundamental test for this party  it must not be about meeting the demands of government  it must be judged on the criteria of meeting the needs of citizens  applause, 10 seconds   mister speaker it's my view that the role of the federal government must be re-examined  the government has put out some proposals on this  but let us remember if we to are to  accept the principle as i certainly do as my party certainly does that the diversity of canada is part of our strength that the rights of first nations the distinctiveness of quebec the rich culture and contribution of our multiculture multi-ethnic communities the equality of men and women all of which are fundamental to who we are as a nation if we are to recognize that diversity in a fundamental way we must also recognize in a fundamental way that the unity of this country will require a federal government that can represent every canadian in all parts of the country in the national interest and the international interest  applause starts that's what the new democratic party  word applause stops   i repeat mister speaker that there are a number of things that we can look favourably upon in initial reading of these proposals but there are also elements that are potentially disturbing elements that indicate that this government has a very different vision of the future of canada  a very different vision and of course it is the conservative party vision of canada but it is a vision certainly in some instances that is certainly not shared by the new nem democratic   party nor by many canadians  it is of course the government's right to put forward its vision in terms of its own political philosophy but if the consultation process if the parliamentary committee is to have any meaning we must seriously look at all visions of canada and try to come up with a consensus on what will best represent all canadians and not one agenda applause, 5 seconds  i want to raise some questions particularly mister speaker on the proposed economic union  i believe we can all agree in this house that the reduction of trade barriers at greater cooperation among provinces and territories is an important and a laudable goals but we must ask some hard questions  does the kind of domestic free trade in people goods finance and capital extend the same laissez faire principles of the canada u s trade deal to a domestic playing field   will there be winners and losers in this and if so how do we deal with that  could this potentially lead to a whole new round of privatization deregulation diminishing social standards and diminishing corporate taxes  as we look at this in terms of greater cooperation  and mister speaker we must raise questions about the ability within canada to reach the goals that we wish to to  reach in this economic cooperation if we in fact do not have a transportation infrastructure in place which is absolutely necessary in a country of this applause starts size and which has lamentably has been systematically destroyed applause stops   what does the right of corporations to free movement of goods services and capital mean for weaker provinces who seek to establish their own economic development programs  what does it mean for provincial crown corporations  what does it mean for provinces or territories trying to support local jobs in fledgling industries  what does it mean for affirmative action  what are the implications of this form of economic union  in terms of aboriginal self-government agreements  economic union that only addresses control and harmon  harmonization but does not mention initiatives to have greater regional equality and to strengthening section thirty-six of the constitution on regional equality falls far short in this party's opinion  applause, 5 seconds   economic union proposals that suggest that the only role of the bank of canada will be to address inflation but not as well to look at unemployment to look at fiscal and monetary policy as an instrument to address unemployment falls far short mister speaker of what we can be and can do if we're to have greater cooperation in the economy across this country  and so i say mister speaker that while we support greater cooperation while we support looking at a renewal of the relationships between the provinces territories and the federal government in economic areas we must also not simply take a defensive posture but a posture that says in this economy we will reach out we will initiate to seek greater equality and that that will be a strong commitment of a federal government any federal government of any political party and a fundamental part of our constitution applause, 10 seconds   mister speaker part of the proposals on the economic union include a council of the federation and there're again many issues i think that must be discussed in terms of what that council will do what kind of decision-making powers that council will have how those will mesh with the decisions of the house of commons and indeed what implications a council of federations has which according to the document instrument make many decisions when in fact aboriginal groups will not be included on that and yet we'll have according to the same document aboriginal self-government agreements  so there are questions to be raised mister speaker  we will be doing so in a constructive manner with alternatives   and i find that what is important as we move into this process at this time is that we are constructive and we do present ah proposals  and when we raise our vision of canada and our alternatives it's not simply to discredit someone else it's because we truly believe that each of us in this house each political party has a contribution which will be fundamentally in the interests of canada and that if all of those contributions can be brought together we will have the kind of consensus on a constitution that we must have because as we know the constitution is not simply the government's constitution the new democratic party's constitution the liberal party's constitution it is a constitution for the people of canada now and in the future applause, 10 seconds   mister speaker i also find it somewhat disturbing that the proposals put put forward today include such things as the entrenchment of property rights but make no mention of the need to entrench social rights applause, 5 seconds
