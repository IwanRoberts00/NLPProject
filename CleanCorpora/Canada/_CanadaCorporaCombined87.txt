them at club price the pansy box  it's a little flower box  it's wooden  mm hmm  and comes with a packets of seed and enough earth to fill it and instructions  oh nice  oh nice  nice if it works  muffled laugh you know   nothing's come up yet  well audibly swallows we just we just did them last week  oh okay  well it'll take a while  that's beautiful   and i called her once uh once in a while m call her more than once in a while but  i once in a while when i call her i say did you water the pansies cos she's very bad with plants  oh dear  she's oh yeah yes yes yes every time i pass   i've left uh p a thing of water by its side  and whenever i pass by i give it a drink  we had t mm we had flower boxes in the back  of our house  phew   mm hmm   they're uh fixed to the side of the wall on the deck  mm hmm  and i often forget about them and um they just bake out there in the sun  mm  then i walk out one day and they look laugh starts   almost sparse laugh ends and i take the hose and drench them down  we just put flowers in in the weekend in  the front  you know that little square thing  mm hmm   ya mm ha   and we bought some roses   i was in cu uh not cut price canadian tire at the cash  mm hmm   two ninety-nine  rose bushes   oh you can't go wrong   so i bought one cos it was uh th th was the one at alexis neon mall   i'm okay aside, followed by the sound of b pouring a drink   okay  and uh i thought thank god i didn't carry more than one  cos as i was walking i realised can get pretty heavy  mm hmm  i was i was tempted to get two  anyway we we then we went to the canadian tire out our way and they were still regularly priced at five ninety-nine  so trevor we went when we went  to church we came in to church in town so we uhm we came downtown to alexis neon and they had a few left  mm hmm  like from cos uh at first there was this huge table filled with them and there was like i  dunno don't know how many could there be  twenty-five left of them but inhale they were gettin  getting some of them were grungy and some of them had snapped off and you had to be careful and   y'ave to you have to  take care of them though and make sure they don't freeze and cover them   up and   uh huh   munching   get straw and hay for them and all kinds of things  don't know if i wanna want to get   that much into gardening  wood chips   i think trevor does  mm hmm munching   i think trevor uh that's his  actually his door slams name speaker sounds like they are saying 'aim' with an 'n' is to have a rose garden  mm hmm   he has some great admiration you hear it  his eyes sorta sort of glaze over   when laugh starts he talks about it laugh ends  mm hmm   you know what i mean laugh   so i thought oh   so i picked that up and so i think we've ended up with five of them  so we put trevor stuck two in the ground munching in the front and we bought a  we went to zellers and we found a bo they were selling seventy-five percent off these bulbs dahlias  speaker pronounces this as 'dullias'   i bought bulbs from zellers and none of them took  i hope you have more luck than i did  mm  maybe i did something wrong  maybe i didn't plant them deep enough or maybe the squirrels went and ate them  but i got one lily out of the whole caboodle and i think i spent about forty dollars on bulbs i's i was  really disappointed  i know could be 'oh no'   these were like fifty cents a package  so again we don't care  it's just uhm basically an experiment  mm hmm mm mm  munching   but munching i bought manure and peat moss and  soil and  gee you bought manure   i could've taken you up to the stable munching   word   i bought compo composted  manure  mm hmm  you ever stopped word to cri  craven   the greenhouse there  is it called craven or someth   sheridan   which greenhouse  the one on the way to you guys  the one on st johns  that sheridan munching   kramer  kramer  kramer  okay  there's another place munching closer  mm munching   you know where the where the restaurant is uhm  le perrot restaurant  where munching   where where thum  the uhm pearls and petals is   mm hmm mm hmm munching   well right next door well just a little ways down on st johns there's a house there  oh this is on the other side  n nn     no  no on the same side as the street on on the  my side of st johns there's a house munching  and and he sells flowers there  some for a little bit cheaper than most nurseries  mm  small little private garden there you know   uhm   right   and my neighbour buys all her flowers there and she's very happy     two or three words munching   word munching i really i  wanna want to get into this  mm hmm  and like uhm our sunday school teacher it was she was she's so she's so funny  i said oh we put we put flowers in the ground and she looks at me flat out and says dear you don't  put flowers in the ground you grow them  from seed  laugh   you plant them   oh   oh i see     two or three words   but she's it a lot of her expressions are mock er like it's mocking   and i think it puts off a lot of people because  they think she's being serious or or   mm   or superior or something  yeah and it it i suppose it  could come across that way but i've maybe i've  just chosen not to take it that way  mm   well you get used to someone and you know which way they're coming from and then it's easy to   i mean i know she's very categorical but i think  i feel there's always a leeway there to sorta  sort of not sort of two words  around it  mumble starts you see   so i four words mumble ends but basically sh it's taken her eight years  to grow perennials  like to get the garden to what it is today   and it's beautiful  it's like a sanctuary  mm hmm   oh some people spend their whole summer out in the garden  and ah munching they're beautiful but   you can't you have to make sure someone's   gonna going to look after them when you go away and  mm hmm   that can be a lot of work  mm  so   and it's very costly  well this is it  she said she doesn't have to buy any flowers now  yes because she has the perennials yeah  annuals munching     can two words quite a bit  oh yeah we spent well counting the manure and stuff like that it costs us forty dollars but we're not finished  i got some tomato plants at zellers   i got nine plants for two dollars and fifty cents  nine plants you're gonna going to  have a lot of tomatoes  yeah  i think so munching   that's if nobody dies you know  oh  you're counting on some dying  mm  sentence spoken through munching and laughter when they die laugh ends   laugh   probably  like word this  knowing my children  mm hmm  swallow well uhm  we have to we have to really work on our lawn this year munching   the weeds are just taking over but i refuse to have some kind of uhm a chemical spray on the lawn  mm hmm  because i wanna want to feel safe  with my kids my child and my child's friends playing on the lawn  i don't want   josie has a friend at school munching who just received a governor-general's award for his  uhm his stamina i guess  wow munching   one could say he's been fighting  he's only about ten year eleven years   old and he has uhm lymphatic uh cancer  mm hmm  and they believe it's from the spraying uhm   oh no   yeah they live on &icircumflex;le cadieux and they live right in between two golf courses which are heavily  sprayed   mm   mm   and uhm apparently the town of &icircumflex;le cadieux  has er had agreed to boycott the  spraying and i guess they ended up catering to pressure from the  owners of the golf course because they reneged on the decision  and this little boy's been campaigning he and his parents have been campaigning now for two years  and the decision went finally went  through council and then they reneged on the cou on the decision so munching   i think the mayor vetoed the decision or something so  there's there was a lot of controversy over that but  he attends school uhm about two-thirds of the time   and the other third of the time he he's  in hospital or at home  he's too sick to come to school  poor baby   and he's lost all his hair and  mm hmm  had a lot of treatment and whatnot and uhm   it's really sad you know uhm to see such a young child suffering  and i guess because we see him cos he's a member of the school it it makes it so much more ah  of an issue for us than if it was just something you read about in the paper and you think gee that's too bad but it's not gonna   going to happen to me or anybody i know kind of thing  mm   but so many people around us spray it's swallow   yeah  i'm afraid i'm guilty of that  munching   like with the lawn hose the weed and feed  well   that's much more controllable than this spra   the spray that the commercial people come   and do  mm hmm   you ever watch them they spray a lot of stuff munching  whereas most people if they're using just the weed and feed or killex they spray directly on to the affected area and that's it  munching   these people spray a lot and they don't seem to take into they're supposed to but i don't believe they take into consideration  children and animals that're that are in the area when they spray  mm hmm  and which way the wind is carrying  i was even concerned about there was a l   the little guy in the back was playing in his back yard with timmy and i told him to go well away while i was doing this even though i knew i wouldn't be touching them at all i just felt  better  mm hmm  yeah i know  i i feel the same way  but the weeds are awful on our lawn i mean  and we've been putting grass seed and   we well the weeds are very bad on our lawn too and they have been for some time because the  fellow who owned the house before us didn't really do anything  and uhm in fact he didn't even cut the grass  uh oh  cos i can remember driving by and seeing the grass  munching   mm probably above like above your waist kind of thing  mm hmm  uhm couple of times during the summer  so he he just let it grow and grow and grow  and i don't think that did wonders for the   for the grass   i'm sure it played havoc with the uhm  a few words     do you have a tissue  oops  ah  very good  all the comforts of hom home   recording is abruptly interrupted by an over-taping incident for about 10 secs; it appears the speakers have shifted into an office space   all the comforts of home everything's here   laugh   laugh   i uhm in my own offi  office today i i realized  that if i was gonna going to do some rearranging in my office that would probably grow  go against anna 's grain   if you were to rearrange your office it would go against   i think so  cos i mentioned something or other about   cos she wanted to stick some stuff in in   storage in my my office cos she saw some  empty spaces   and i said well i don't know i haven't decided whether i  wanna want to put the cabinet there or do this or that  it opened up a whole start heavy sarcasm  discussion end heavy sarcasm laugh   oh dear   i may ah m hah then i sort of realized oh oh  my office start laugh space is not my own end laugh   that's right  that's right now uhm   people are really touchy about space you know  it's a very very delicate issue  and i think that if you empower people with   with space i think you get more out of them you know  there's a productivity i'm sure that there   has to be inhales phone rings a productivity uhm  speaker a picks up and puts down phone receiver   jenna must have picked it up  uhm i'm sure that there must be ah an issue over productivity there because i think if if you  you have to have things the way you want them
