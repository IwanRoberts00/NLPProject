 jack babineau is of course the director of police services for the m u c montreal city police department   chief of police babineau joins us now  good morning sir  good morning mister gore   thanks for joining us this morning  my pleasure  you and your people had a tough week last week a very  tough week  yeah very tough week uhh i mean these things   you you always know that you know it  could happen but uhh when you're the uh police chief   you you i think it's your nightmare uhh and it it happened uhh and uhh you know   we uhh we have to overcome the situation  but still it's kind of hard  what's the latest in the investigation of the murder of  roberta piquard   i see this morning some specialized police services may be being called on  what what's happening  well you know uhuh obviously i won't talk about details but  we we're working on the case uhh trying to find uhh why uhh constable piquard was shot  and when you find the uhh the motive for uhh the shooting you you're usually next to the uh person who's who committed the murder  so we're working on it right now and i wouldn't like to go in detail obviously uhh   maybe you could confirm or deny this but i think the report in the journal montreal newspaper this morning saying you're trying to build up potential psychological profiles in the absense of you know any visual identification by any witness  that's what you're having to deal with  well the there's a science uhh developed in the united states with the f b i over the last twenty years called profiling  uhh and it you know with what happened on the scene the way the person was shot you can make a profile the not " of the" suspect you're looking for  and that's what we're going to be using uhm in a couple of days  as you know a number of questions about the security or lack thereof around that substation  was it consistent with procedures that she was there by herself   in that substation   oh yeah well everyday you got over two hundred police officers working on their own in patrol cars in stations  walking the beat  uhh you know when you wear this uniform there's always   always this potential for danger  that you might get hit  and that's what happened  so it's not unusual that she was she was  alone  what about things like i mean security cameras  that came up as well  why wasn't there a camera there even as as   a dissuasive measure but in terms of trying to crack the case after the fact  but do you really think cameras are a dissuasive uhh operation  we had cameras at the assembl&eacute;e nationale  and uhh you know people got shot  we have cameras in uhh banks and still they are getting robbed  we have cameras at the casino  uh two days ago a person sitting at a table decided to pull out a gun and and and make a robbery there even though there are plenties of camera plenty of cameras   uhh so you know it's not a deterrent  uhh we have to find ways so that our people don't get shot  and uhh it's kind of hard you know to be uhh protected uhh all the time  but are you committed to the substations and  cos it sounds to me like no changes in procedures for those substations  there won't be any changes  uhh and i'm pretty sure constable piquard uhh you know would have said the same thing  the key solution to problems that we have in this society  mainly violence is to go through community policing  the closer we're going to get to the population if we you know uhh if we're able to build bridges with the community uhh these things won't happen  you know you don't shot not " shoot" you know people you know  or uhh you know people around the police station will be uhh sort of a protection  uhh so that's the to me the way of the future  i want to pick up on another story that's the news this morning  the wolverine squad more arrests this morning and seems to seem like this initiative has become  has been very successful since you've finally got everybody together and started working together  i mean i've had this question right through so i'm going to ask you why did it seem to take so long to get everybody together and working in one direction  mhm well mainly it's a question of budget  i mean wolverine is doing a great job  it's not only to pull people together  uh it's a question of having the dollars  i mean it cost not " costs" a lot  uhm and we had this budget given by the quebec government  it made you know a big difference  ever since we worked  i think the police itself has done you know a great job  my main concern is that will the  judicial system correctional system will be able to follow uhh what we are doing right now  i mean it makes no sense if we make the arrest and people involved  in in these gangs uh get six months or a year in prison  so uhh you know after we've done our job somebody else has to do theirs  now this is supposed to be though part of the plan  i remember mister menard the minister of public security when he was talking about putting this in place and finding the budget one of the things he said was we've you know we got to make very sure that when those people end up before a judge that  that judge has all the information he needs to be able to make the kind of not only judgment but also the kind of sentencing that might act   as a as well as an element in beating this thing  umhm   are you sound like you're still sceptical though about the judges and their role in this  well ahh obviously they need to be informed uhh but to uh to to inform them we need uhh the tools to be able to do it mainly uh prosecutors  uhh we're going uh through uh you know kind of budget problems  uhh how do we uhh make sure that we can have twenty more prosecutors to do the job  and this is a question of money  and that's what they are debating uhh right now in  in quebec city news report interruption   chief babineau i wanted to get some of your thoughts on the uhh the big announcement yesterday by a number of ministers of various ministries uhh here in quebec about measures designed to prevent conjugal violence   mhm   and there's a whole array of things that were there from each of these ministries  one of the major ones though seems to be just trying to make sure  you know it's a bit like the wolverine task force the information flows   mhm   that if a guy gets out of prison that that  his spouse who's a potential target of violence is informed  that that the police  the local police gets the information into their computers quickly so that the man or woman on the street in the car can you know punch it up right away  it's what do you think of some of these things that are were announced yesterday  what what about this whole problem  cos it's huge  i mean just this past week what four women found killed  my my first comment is at last  ahh you know it took it took a long time  uhh the m u c police has had a program like that for a over a year  uhh we have four police officers working uh at the uhh  parajustice uh and they're informing uhh women that their uhh husband uhh is getting out  uhh and we're working with the victims  and then we we've had that for a year now  so it's working pretty good  how does that system work  so as as soon as someone is to be released for whatever reason there's an immediate contact with the person  before the person is released there's a call uhh to the victim saying within uh within an hour the uhh person involved in your incident will be freed she the   person is getting out  uhh is everything alright  they're working with the person helping them to find solutions to the problem  if the problem is security we might find a place for them  and help them to go through this nightmare  so those four officers are are  contact people in both directions  i mean if if a problem arises from the side of the woman or the citizen they can get in touch with them  that's it  that's what was missing before  well one of the other things that i mean cos one of the things mister menard spoke about yesterday was the delays that often happen  you know as even if it's known it doesn't necessarily get into the computer so that maybe somebody knows but everybody doesn't know  is that part of your procedures as well   mhm   is that in that's in all  those those little onboard computers i see your folks tapping into all the time  laugh well their job uhh with this program  the the police officers involved   their job is to uh make sure the victim is well-secured  and the victim knows what's happening  and uhh you know we're there to help  and that's the uh the main change  we are uh we are involved in the case and we know what uh people are going through  so we're trying to help them uh you know try to find solutions  mister menard also seemed to talk in terms of uh really  targeting those responsible for the violence  i mean maybe they were convicted on a violent i mean on a charge linked directly to the violence but if you can get em on anything else whether it's firearms possession or weapons possession or just like anything you slap with it  is is that your approach as well  uhh i fully agree with that  i mean uhh violence uh should not be a part of what's happening in our society  i mean too often and it's too bad people solve their problems with violence  and it's not only adults kids do it  so uh uh together we have to find solutions  and i think the uh proposition uh given yesterday is one uh step in a good direction  just a little bit of a budget from that ministry for these things  fifty thousand dollars i think it is for training  feeling that there needs to be some kind of upgrading or   sense sensitivity training i guess you'd say  for officers in this whole field of conjugal violence  where do you think you are with your force on that issue  yeah well there will always be budget problems uhh but   that's not uh it shouldn't stop us from you know taking care of victims   and uhh the main thing uh victims want is to know  to get the information  what's happening what will happen to me  and and i think we're answering these questions right now  the the and as i say there were a number of ministers involved in that press conference yesterday  mister rochand doctor rochand  talking about ahh special budgets for support services uhh the minister of education talking about you know some getting at the uhh roots of violence as well  yeah uhuh mhm yeah violence   how optimistic are you about these kind of initiatives  i mean it's easy to be cynical easy to be   pessimistic and i'm sure especially you see the kinds of things you see  everyday it's especially easy to be cynical and pessimistic  mhm mhm   but what's what's  how reasonably how can how reasonably  optimistic can we be about this   it works and and you know it's not only a question of procedures it's a question of caring for victims  and it's a a change in attitudes  if we change the attitude  if if you're a police officer and you're dealing only this case and you know it's for you only a case well  we won't uhh we won't be able to solve the uhh   the the whole problem  if as a police officer you think that there's a problem   and the problem is the victim is facing this problem  and you are there to care for the victim you will find solutions
