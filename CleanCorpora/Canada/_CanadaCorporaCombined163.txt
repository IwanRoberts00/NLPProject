correct me if i'm wrong i i get the impression that uhm  you have a severe dislike for percy grey-tootoo   would that be fair  in the past i would i would uh say that but in the beginning i i adored the  fella fellow   'kay okay   well as of today your word    no i don't think so  i think he's got his problems but i don't dislike the man  you don't dislike him  no sir  okay  you you're not uhm relishing uhm  the idea of of saying  things that might stab in the heart of  no sir   nothing of the sort   nothing of the sort sir  you're not relishing it  no  you're just doing your duty by being here  no sir  i'm a very honest person  you're a very honest person  yes sir  and i suppose that hasn't changed at all  you've always been a honest person  yes sir  uhh before today and including today  well there's everybody has their day sir  ya  well i just want to be clear of what you're saying  you've just given yourself a character reference and you say you're a very honest person  has that always been so or is it a change   i don't understand the question sir   well have you always been honest  well i don't think so sir  i don't think any person has  okay  so when you say you're an honest person that means today you're an honest person  no sir   what does it mean  it means well i'm an honest person  i can say what i feel and what's honest   all right  and you've always done that  i i believe i have  all right  and can i get something of your uh education and training please  uh wh where did you do   your uh your elementary school   i was educated in montrea  montreal   i was educated in montreal  and uh  st. stephen's and uh havishill high school  okay  so you've graduated from grade twelve from   word   that's it  from havishill   that's it  and have you uh any advanced education beyond the grade   twelve   no no  i went to uhm ah business administration and i've had some uhm  several different courses in art  i got a degree in commercial art  you have degree in commercial art  yes sir  where's that  l'&eacute;cole des grands-arts  montreal  say again   l'&eacute;cole des grands-arts in montreal  and is that  when you say a degree is that a uh   word bachel bachelor  of fine arts degree  it's an art it's an art   no no no  it's   no it's just a commercial art degree course you know credit  what is the degree you've got  in commercial art  what's the degree  is it is there letters that go with the degree  no   it's nothing great  i'm not a doctor  so okay  so but how how long a course was that  oh i think it was uhm about a year or two i would say  year or two  it you're not sure if it was a year or two years  i'm not sure   ya   it's not imperative i don't think   just asking you  was it do you know if it was a year or two years  cos there's a difference   well let's say a year   okay so it was a year course   is that right  fine   i'm not asking you whether it's fine or not   ya  okay sorry   yes sir  yes  all right   and then after you took your commercial art course what did you do  i went to work as a marketing sales rep   mumbles   oh no sorry  excuse me  i went to work for the australian embassy in washington d c  i'm sorry about that  in what capacity was that  i was in the in the registry there  uh it's a class a-one vi visa  uh foreign official uh diplomat in uh washington d c working for the the australian government  a-one visa  so you were a diplomat maybe three words   well i was   no  i wasn't a diplomat  i was a foreign official being paid by the australian government in washington d c  a foreign official   'kay okay   and your capacity with the australian government was as a diplomat  no  as a registrar  a registrar   what does that involve  well like uh filing of and taking documents that are coming in from overseas and working as a well more of a clerk  okay  and how long did you work for the australian government  i was with them  well i got transferred to san francisco   uh i worked as a liaisons officer there and i was with them for  eww maybe four or five years  with the australian government  yes   and after that  i moved to vancouver  in what capacity  uhm i opened several of my own businesses  such as  uh restaurants a flower shop a landscaping company uhm  import a few words   okay   and you then eventually  is it after that you took a position with percy grey-tootoo  or redside word   uh no not right away  i went with an insurance company which a friend of mine was working for  he asked me to come on board with him as a sales rep and i worked with him for a year or so and it wasn't quite what i   to my liking   and uh then i went on with uhm percy grey-tootoo   and were you hired by percy uhh on behalf of  redside or  no that's another story sir  ya   i was hired by percy on behalf of redside  but redside didn't recognize it  and uhm uh i still have a dispute with redside but i'm not gonna going to word   far gone that they wouldn't pay the salary   so how long did you work for redside   well we were at redside uhh it wasn't too long because they were trying to oust him at that time  uh regardless of word how long did how long did you work at redside   oh it could have been three months   could have been three months  uh   well let's say two months so i can get your accuracy for  ya you   well let's word   say two months it would be right on  two months would be right on  ya  it's a long time ago sir   now what what uh what did you do with redside   uhm i helped percy pack up the business   what was what was what were  you hired to do   there was no uh job discrepancy or uh job description at that time  so what you actually did do is help close redside  down   yes sir  and uh as i understand it did redside go out of business at that point in time  they're still doing very well today sir  are they  ya  not as a chemical company mind you  well the chemical side of it   yes sir   they had redside chemicals did we not  as another aspect of managing redside   yes sir   yes sir  and you were working for redside chemicals  presumably  i presumably yes sir  and redside chemicals does not exist any longer  no sir  and when mr grey-tootoo left that was the  termination of redside chemical  that was the shut down  i believe so sir  is that not right   yes sir i believe so   and and when you say  did you suggest that that they wanted him out  they wanted to oust him out or something like that  what were you saying  yes i'd i believe they would  you got that from a source at redside   from the president  and and the source said  uhm they just couldn't do work anymore  there was uh there was no sales  'kay okay   there was nothing being produced and uh a lot of money being spent and uh   'kay okay   and that was information you obtained before you left redside  yes sir  okay  so from the two months you were working there you were told that  yes sir  and who was that president by the way  uhm i can get you his name uh  you don't know it  it doesn't strike me at this time no  okay  a very large gentleman though  large gentleman  yes  so you had a chat with him about   uh he had a chat with me sir  okay  and then you were invited to come to macaroon by  percy grey-tootoo   uhm actually i don't know  it's a combination of robert rester and percy grey-tootoo   okay  so you dealt with robert rester in in  vancouver  and uh here as well sir   uhm not here  in uhm edmonton sir  and in uh and he had a learjet and he was flying back and forth negotiating with uhm   with mr grey-tootoo  with you   and you too  well not in the beginning sir  well   it was mr grey-tootoo 's idea to bring me over here  and you obviously wanted to come here to work with him  uhm we had our doubts but yes uh we seemed to have great opportunity  did you want to come with him or not  uh yes sir at that time i did  you wanted to come work with percy grey-tootoo   yes sir because we believed in him  that's good  and uh even though the president had tried to discourage you  of redside   yes sir  i had i had no idea that   uh what their financial problems were but uh it didn't have anything to do with his personal personality   as far as i was concerned  right   okay  and before you worked for uh redside you had absolutely no involvement with the chemical  chemical companies   no sir   no sir  okay   and you say robert rester recruited you as well  in edmonton he made an offer to me yes  ya   and and where did he see you  uhm he didn't have a position  he thought uh i word that i should be in sales  where where did you have this meeting with mr rester   at uh his office uhm in edmonton  which office is that  he has redtag drilling in edmonton  okay  and so you've never been separate apart from uhh  grey-tootoo   uh no mr grey-tootoo was there  and i led him into a room now i think  mr grey-tootoo was in the same room  okay  and and he offered you a position there  yes   'kay okay   and what was your pay arrangement then  uh there was none at that point in time but uh when i left with mr grey-tootoo he said uh you will have a car and expenses  and uh when i left vancouver you'll get thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars a year and all the hoopla that goes with it  'kay okay   now that was told to you by rester   by mr grey-tootoo when i left redside   did you discuss with mr rester what your   financial arrangement would be   uh no i didn't i didn't   feel i had to because mr grey-tootoo was doing the  nego negotiating   so the answer is you didn't discuss it  no  okay   and so the the as a result of these discussions you came with mr grey-tootoo to set up redtag chemicals or to set up the chemical operation   is that correct  that's right  and you were at redside long enough to know whether or not redside was manufacturing any chemicals  uhm i'd seen stock there  no i wasn't there long enough to see if they'd been making any  money or not   did you see if they had the facilities to make chemicals at  redside   yes i did  and did they  not really sir no  not really  no  they had no facilities to manufacture   they had uh one little blending tank there and it couldn't have done anything sir  well what is a blending tank used for  uh if you're going to blend any quantity you'd want to have quantities over a thousand gallons so  right   so but if you have a blending tank what do they use it for  for blending material  for for what   is that the words   what do you use it for  what do you use it for water and uhm colour i guess
