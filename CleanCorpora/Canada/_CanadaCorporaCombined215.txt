 a few words they're draining on energy laugh  i ah what what you'll   notice is you'll work an eight-hour workday and come home exhausted at five o'clock where an entrepreneur will go for fourteen sixteen hours and at the end of the day well all pumped up and all ready to go for some more  uh it's all a function of doing something you love as opposed to doing something just for a paycheck   cough and if you're looking for security from the large corporations uh only sixteen of the word  hundred largest corporations at the start of the twentieth century still exist today  ah during the eighties a total of two hundred and thirty companies  disappeared from the fortune five hundred  only twenty-nine of the top a hundred companies are still in the top a hundred today  so in other words large corporations are no longer the security that they used to be in the past  as a matter of fact many of them are either breaking up or merging or you know uh uh outsourcing virtual word  their work and so they're becoming virtual corporations  uhm what i would like to do if i can no  this just just shows you the change from the uh  you know the word   eighty-five percent of the workers in the early nineteen nineties were in ag agriculture   now agriculture involves less than three percent of the workforce  word a lot of opportunities in agriculture  a student of mine uh had a uh uh his father was a farmer and farmers are really being hard hit traditional farmers wheat corn all the all the traditional crops  so this guy's really sharp and he decided he'd go into a growing niche market  he crea started growing  learning to grow chinese vegetables   a very small market but if you become the big fish in that small market uh a few words mumbled   he had he had he had his business and was so successful that actually agriculture canada called him  he was twenty-two years old at the time  they wanted him to come to ottawa to talk to all the farmers from out west and explain to him explain to them how he was successful  so i said well why are you going to go and tell them all your secrets  he said i'm not telling them all the secrets  he says a few words mumbled the trip's on them  they're going to pay my uh bedroom word   he admitted of course he uh said he would have gone to dallas looked over some land and found some land to buy because dallas being close to mexico being close to the labour for the farm the ill  the illegal immigrants who come in and  do do the farming  and he said he said to me he says uh i don't know what i should do  he said should i stay in school finish my degree or should i go and start my chinese vegetables in dallas   so i said well seeing as you don't need a degree to to  to be successful in dallas i said i'd go to dallas and a few words mumbled   last i heard he was quite successful  uhm so in the fifties the nineteen fifties seventy-three percent of employees worked in manufacturing  now less than fifteen percent do  manufacturing has gone the way of the dinosaur  and now you're looking at service industries typically information  service industries   the reason word jobs change is  word happen faster than it ever did in the past  uh change is around us  it's constant  and you have to learn now to adapt to constant change  get comfortable with this shifting platform and never really being secure solid stable for any period of time  things and conditions are changing constantly  uhm the certainty of misery is better than the misery of uncertainty   that's uh from a pogo cartoon and it shows why a lot of people are resistant to change and deny change because they are comfortable in what they've done so long that they don't wanna want to  change because it's certainty  and certainty is comforting   i was a i was a cop for six years by the way in westmount  one of my this is my fifth i'm going into my fifth career   uh i was a cop back in the sixties in westmont for six years and we noticed this phenomenon with abused women  often we'd go and we'd ask them to get out of the relationship  like we'd get the same call over and over back to the same home to the same abusive relationship we'd say come lay charges get rid of him  and you know what again the the certainty of misery is better than the misery of uncertainty and they wouldn't break away from that relation because they got trapped into this uh habit or if you will comfort zone of certainty   anyway uh the the bottom line is in order to be an entrepreneur you have to be comfortable with a roller coaster of uncertainty  and uh roller coasters are for some people are exciting and for other people they're scary  some people hate the roller coaster  other people love the roller coaster  you have to learn to love the roller coaster laugh because  in in in your own business you're not going to get that certainty of the regular paycheck the nine to five that you know exactly what's going tomorrow  tomorrow is undetermined and that's the excitement of it  that's the fun of it is nothing happens tomorrow until you make it happen  it's a little scary laugh and it puts a lot on your shoulders but it's going to be fun  and the thing is it's just a question of labelling it as exciting and fun as opposed to being fearful  uhm so let's look at who our entrepreneur like what what  ha what makes them tick  i'll show you some uh information here on uh business majors versus entrepreneurship majors versus non-business majors  in terms of conformity you can see that entrepreneurship majors have a very low level of conformity than do business majors and non-business majors  in other words they don't aren't  uh hurt by social sabotage  social sabotage is the concept that if you have a good idea for a business first thing you do is go tell your spouse your relatives your friends they'll say wow is ever that a good idea  you're all pumped up  you're ready to go   so what's the first reaction audience responds   you're nuts  don't be crazy  go and get a real job  right  so now if you if you allow that to take the wind out of your sails then you're stuck in that trap of conformity  in other words you're not doing what's normal or expected so therefore you sh you don't fit in  you have to be able to break that bond  you have to be able to go even though everybody says no it doesn't make sense  so that's where entrepreneurship majors uh have that less  or more innovative more creative  more off the wall perhaps  energy level much higher   you know i find that  you know the harsh reality isn't isn't set here  that is to say i see it the other way around laugh   in other words i don't see high energy people going in business for themselves  i see that going in business for yourself picking up your energy   uh the reverse causality if you will  in other words if you have if you go to a regular job nine to five every day it's it's  draining  it's tiring  you're exhausted  you don't know why you're word   in fact the less you do in the job the more tiring it is  if that makes any sense whatsoever  and it's even going to work and coming home  uh i see them on the commuter trains  i see them on the ar on the buses   you ever see the people  they're a herd going in in the morning and coming home at night  are they smiling  let me ask you do they look like they're going off to have a good time  no way   they're exhausted  they're b they're beat before  they've got to work   so the the the energy level is not there  and at work if your boss says would you mind doing this oh boy huh not another thing  you watch an entrepreneur in action and you'll see these people fifteen sixteen hours a day  i've had entrepreneurs into my class  now these guys have been up since seven in the morning  having had a full day come into my class eight twenty-five to ten thirty or ten fifty at night and they're on top of their game  and the students say excuse me how many hours a day do you work  and do you know what they answer  they look funny and they go i don't know cos it's not work  ah eh eh it's confucious that said if you get a job that you like you'll never have to work another day in your life   well that's what it's all about for entrepreneurs  they don't count hours  there is no such thing  there is no on and off  there is no talk about beep time to go home   it's hey there is it it their  their work runs into their life  and so they word working sixteen hours no problem  uh interpersonal effect much lower  interpersonal effect means the impact that people have on you  in other words how much you are influenced by others  and actually if you're highly influenced by others you're not going to go into business for yourself because it won't take long for someone to decide that would be crazy word go with the other way instead  risk taking higher  social adroitness higher   social adroitness is a skill of entrepreneurs called networking   the name of the game is the more people you know the more business you do  so entrepreneurs real entrepreneurs and the word  and the people who are word  they would have known half of you by now because before they would have been hanging in word saying hi nice to meet you  exchanging cards finding out who's who seeing if they can make a deal seeing if they kind find at least one or two people here who they will be able to contact next week to be able to do some business with   that's networking and that's what entrepreneurs do extremely well   uhm autonomy very high  they're very individualistic   change very high  they don't mind the concept of change  in fact they relish it  they love it   and harm avoidance low  in other words they're not they're not  motivated to avoid harm  they a few words with risk taking  and word is low  word is uh uhm uh non-profit maybe too nice  they don't they they it's finding guts  laugh   entrepreneurship is fun  it has to be fun  if you're going into business to do some  i could give you a hundred great business ideas and so tomorrow you could go out and start one of them and probably be successful  i'll show you when i show you ideas  i'll show you some great ideas   but if you don't like it if you're not going to enjoy it then why do it  if you're going to do it sixteen hours seven hours a week why do it unless it's fun   so there has to be a fun element  you have to be doing something you like   and of course the second half of that equation is profit   if it's fun without profit it's a hobby   so if you don't have that profit motivation you won't be a good entrepreneur  and that's that's what holds a lot of people back   you know you are laugh as a consumer   if you ever  when you're wearing your hat and your role is consumer when you go into a store uh you you're taught to be a good consumer  you're taught to be like a vulture  you know wait and see and if a store looks like it's going out of business wait till next week cos maybe they'll be fifty percent off  you know you're driving a hard bargain as a con  consumer as a customer   and so on the other side if you're the entrepreneur or or  or the sales person then you have to also play hardball too because otherwise you'll be ending up giving everything away
