 but uhm it there was no question of panic  we uh we made it eventually  words up  i don't know where the money came to fix the brakes but we somehow managed to scrape it together and made it home in one piece  hmm   do you know something interesting that uhm why we slide into the past like this  uh uh you start out looking at these two photographs all of the sudden we're way way back in the past  it has nothing to do with what we're talking about  marriage abandonment where we are now is because of where we were then  well what are you gonna going to do now  i'd like to say i have a wonderful masterplan but i am waiting for some sorts of inspiration with writing my writing and  well why do you have to have inspiration  i'd like to be tremendously excited about one project i can just throw myself into and the most logical idea for that would be a book being a big project  a book of what  well the book of essays is still a possibility and uhm  words   by what you call my vintage anne-marie   and i thought i had more words together than i do although i haven't precisely counted them up  but chloe said i have to have at least forty thousand  words   how much  at least forty thousand that would be bottom end  uh that's bottom  and uhm well the idea is that uhm because publishing is in such short sorry shape uh that publishers are starting to produce s s will produce smaller books   but seventy is more seventy thousand is more ballpark   so when i started adding up the number of stories i had i got a little taken back  and how many d do  how how many do you have  i i didn't didn't  add it up but it'd be uh twenty or twenty-five that i could put together  as many as that  ya   but didn't you say that that with visual artists once they finish something they're irritated with it  they want to almost push it away and not look at it  ya  and i found that when i was going through some of the stories i felt well yes it's reasonably written and has interest i suppose uhm but i don't like it anymore  i don't like the theme or it seems too melancholy it seems too self-indulgent  you know the the critical voice that starts and so that i i want something fresh that i can begin with  i don't want any a anne-marie   in agony stories  anne-marie in bliss laugh   laugh eke   we're good at bliss laugh   laugh   we do it very well laugh   we just need to write about it  well can't you manufacture it  manufacture bliss  ya  not really  well i mean do you have to be blissful to write about bliss  actually no  i'm word suzie and i had an interesting conversation about that because blissful writing is invariably boring   uhm it's laugh no it's true   laugh   it's like that dreadful radio interview that uh chloe  and i had to go through for c b c and the woman interviewer kept circling back to give us blood give us guts give us how incredibly neurotic you are  and we said we're not neurotic  we have healed  we do love  we are entirely functional loving human beings  and she found that about as interesting as a lemon meringue pie recipe  uhm we had to fight   that was did we tell you about what a disaster that was   no  no  absolute resisting  obviously the interviewer's very capable and articulate and forceful and it was like pushing that rock up the hill  uhm chloe and i were seated across from one another and we kept looking to huh one another for support and resisting resisting resisting this notion that one event or one person or many events and one person had ah irreparably harmed us  we said no and that answer was not accepted  and uhm so we came out of forty-five minutes or perhaps it was even an hour of interview feeling as though we'd run a twenty-five mile marathon  but actually quite pleased with ourselves too because had we felt less conviction about our mental and emotional and spiritual health uh we wouldn't have been as forceful in resisting her ideas  so we felt good about that   well the problem with that you know uhm  let's hope that thing can be laid to rest  you know that that death can be accepted now and you know i mean and quite frankly the the death of  kim has managed to get a fair amount of mileage you know   from the point of view of uh literature  yes   and uh i hope now that uh her spirit can be buried and  not forever but certainly not resurrected in  uh and written about anymore   well i agree  i f i uh certainly have desire to write too much more about that   well this is our first pause in twenty or so minutes  well i was thinking about those those  deaths in the family you know never really fade  you know you can never forgive self and forgive other people that we're not committed to forget  that's the one thing that took me a long long time to understand  cos it for myself anyway forgiveness is mandatory i mean even forgiving myself you know    especially even  specially   but but i'm never permitted to forget  you know   well if i take nothing away from this particular visit it's going to be live one day at a time underscored so heavily again  that's what i'm going to do too  word you know i had a   some difficulty yesterday with anson and  camille talking about that  he really doesn't understand it  uhh i re remember my friend  mendela that beautiful millionaire meatpacker from saskatoon who was so nice to me when i was a young man and i was talking to him one day and i asked him about plans and so forth and he'd be about my age now about seventy and he said you know mister samson we don't worry about the future we just wake up in praise at the   f fact in the morning praising the fact we're still alive  you know  uhm anson just didn't understand that emphasis of that point  i said i behave as if is this is this might be the last day of my life and i try to uhm  word and dry in terms of what i've experiences that  you and try to put some of it into a spiritual system  he simply can't understand the lack of planning for the morrow  he's actually unable to understand  he said but you must have a plan  you you don't uhh exist as if you're   gonna going to die tomorrow  you have some schemes ahead  you must plan what you're gonna going to   read or think otherwise it'd be nihilism  it isn't  it's it's a it's something i  preface you know word   when you're old you have no idea how long you're gonna   going to live and you have to grab onto what you've got   well i think i said to you yesterday too that an ability of his to understand is uhh based to me on spiritual differences  uh what do you mean   uhh   well this stance of one day at time via a a and and   and other influences is a spiritual philosophy because it asks of you to give your very best in each moment  and that moment being the immediate one  ya it's it's spiritual but very  pragmatic too  i mean you have no control over yesterday  that's gone finished  now is all of the the uh implications of what you did yesterday will live on  you have a clue what's gonna going to  happen tomorrow   you really you don't have a clue  you have you hope that certain things will materialize but you do not know  so what are you left with  you're left with today it's exactly what you're left with  and if i do a fairly decent job today if i am around tomorrow to experience it it will make it easier  i know that  but i have a heritage of of discord  to to uh face tomorrow then it's gonna  going to be difficult  so his concerns stemmed from the idea that you're not  really looking after yourself  not planning for the future  i i'm not concerned with the future  i'm only concerned with today  but i'm asking why he was perturbed by that  cough   he couldn't understand it that's all  he wasn't perturbed he just couldn't understand it   you can not perturbe a nihilist you know  laugh laugh   laugh yes yes word    what'd he say   no you can't you can't  i mean he's seen he's an old experienced guy   and he's seen too much and heard too much and s   you know and he's dealing with a bunch of poor bastards at the moment who've gone bankrupt  you know their lives are just shattered you see and he's trying to help em them pull  emselves themselves together so they don't you know do don't be violent to themselves or mess around  you know that in this materialist world when  when you're absolutely hooked in with what you've got that's your importance how much do you make what type of a home do you have what kind of a car do you drive  uh if you don't measure up to to  this myth of uhm how do you call that in swears then you're fuck all you're nothing huh  as you said the other day the masses didn't have an awareness and neither did you in terms of what it is that they don't have the v c rs and the   well they're bombarded with television every single day of their lives  right  anger is one of many reasons why chloe never had the television in the house with rosalyn because the way the advertising is aimed at the kids  you have to have this   i was gonna going to ask you actually about uh uhm the the gig with vin  uhm uhh len 's been practising and he said he'd  he'd be able to play a beatles' song or two if  i mean if they wanted to   oh ya that'd be cool   words you know i thought that would be neat  ya just play some chords  ya well sure or let it be is a nice one  i wouldn't mind doin doing  that i it's pretty straight forward  okay   i like drums in let it be  uhh i think they're light ones but i don't know  but something else we could see  uhm ya i was trying to think of some songs  what was there uhh  there were some other ones i was listening to at any rate  we'll work it out and see what we can do  do you think you could still do great balls of fire like singing-wise  i think i can ya  well  i could w work   re-work-out the chords  ah ohh well laugh you know maybe uh uh   i think my voice has gotten stronger since then mhhm   ya i think it's gotten better  i think i could do it  words- hesitation i don't know if  if you'd want len playing drums there you could see uh but it was kinda kind of nice just you and me  uh that was how you did it originally  well we'll see  ya our first sojourn on stage  puff that was incredible laugh   wasn't that fun  that was  it was like after took me til i got down to the states after the show to realize my god we got a standing ovation  it was like yes  i was up all night  you know what i wish though i wish uhm someone would have taped it  hmm   yaa geez  like you know  ya i know  frozen for well not frozen but  you know   laugh oh well  ahh you know maybe let someone tape the m s society for us  mhh i don't know word i don't  know if we'd be up to par  laugh   really   you don't think we've gotten a wee bit better  ahh   well i don't think well maybe you have   i don't think i have
