 she concludes with a quotation from donna haraway's essay a manifesto of of cyber for cyborgs and thus makes explicit her association of the aesthetic project of cyberpunk and the political project of what she terms postmodern feminism  she concludes cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate  quote continues   there are however extremely good reasons to be sceptical of the alliance wrought by hollinger   first cyberpunk is an almost exclusively a male domain  in the words of pat murphy an award winning author of feminist science fiction speaking on a women's panel on the status of science fiction today she writes or said at the time that cyberpunk is largely a  boys' club   and a quick rundown of the major cyberpunk authors would reveal such  uh the names are run from gibson to sterling from k w jeter lewis shiner uhm joseph shirley uh largely all men and with the perhaps the only major exception of the recent novel by pat cadigan called sinners which has just come out   a second reason for scepticism is the fact that cyberpunk's interest in demonstrating the permeability of the human body does not ultimately displace or even volatize what are sorry volatize the category of man rather the masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality  it's a long phrase that i will sketch out further later on  the masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality in gibson's neuromancer represents what arther kroker describes as the  hyperinfusion of power by a male sex which seeks to hide the privileging of the phallocentric gaze by theorizing the disappearance of its power into seduction   it is my contention that much of cyberpunk's problematization of the humanist subject and the real simulation opposition inscribes an acute anxiety of male displacement even as it heralds the age of homo datum   the electronic space which at once threatens male power while simultaneously offering new opportunities for dominance is called cyberspace  in gibson's novel it refers to the quote consensual hallucination experienced by computer operators that the network that they work in is a separate geographical space an imaginary realm of pure information which can be accessed through a set of electrodes placed at the temples  what happens is the computer operator puts this headband on ah closes his eyes and upon opening his eyes he is entered into this  this inner world that's at once an extension of his of his own mind  the console operator loses contact with empirical reality and opens an inner eye on vistas of data  looks out upon this is a quotation from neuromancer the steeped scarlet pyramid of the eastern seaboard fishing authority burning beyond the green cubes of mitsubishi bank of america and high and very far away the spiral arms of military systems forever beyond reach   neuromancer is to many the first and last word in the cyberpunk genre  it is for hollinger the c p limit test   c p for cyberpunk   its hero is a console cowboy that's what these hackers are called  console cowboys called case  case is one of the an elite group of hackers who know the secrets of breaking into and extracting data from the secret piles uh in corporate in corporate systems  console cowboys are the lone bandits of a society in which information has become the most valuable commodity and the chief currency of exchange  their computers become more and more to be more than simply the tools of their trade but the very condition of their identity and their being   the first one cough which begins the story is this  the sewer is the conscience of the city   quote continues   this is from victor hugo les mis&eacute;rables eighteen sixty-two  on august the seventeenth nineteen fifty-two a few   y years weeks before i entered my last year of high school i bought victor hugo's massive novel les mis&eacute;rables the english edition one thousand two hundred and twenty-two pages long published in nineteen thirty-one by the modern library of the world's best book the giant series translated by charles e wilbur  that same summer i worked on the construction crew that was laying the first water and sewer mains under the streets of creighton the town where i lived  i was seventeen  creighton population eight hundred had of course no bookstore  neither did nearby lethbridge population twenty-two thousand  but sometime earlier i had discovered that the stationery store on seventh street south did offer a back corner with a few world classics  none of which had ever been written in canada of course   in december nineteen fifty-one i had bought my first book there pickwick papers by charles dickens and i spent all of christmas day except the compulsory sunday morning uh church service morning uh lying on the living room couch laughing myself into fits until my mother whose gift to me the book was decided she had made a mistake in letting me choose it   she had had no choice  i wanted a book for christmas and she could not read english  but to waste an entire serious holiday laughing   fortunately i was a fast reader though enjoyment and coughing slowed me down on this one   but les mis&eacute;rables was no novel of laughter and forgetting  not even in a brilliant windy southern alberta summer sunday of the early fifties  nor can the present world tour musical version of that story make it that   as hugo states in his nineteen sixty-two preface the book deals with the degradation of man by poverty the ruin of women by starvation and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night    now the fact is that most modern canadians like myself are immeasurably fortunate  not one of these conditions has ever really applied to us  nevertheless in july nineteen ninety-one when i walked along the beautiful streets of present-day creighton i remember the deep trenches that piled up the earth here in pyramidal rows thirty-nine years ago the sewers that surely still lie where i helped place them and i also think of the hero of les mis&eacute;rables jean valjean carrying his unconscious enemy with such ineffable honour through the immense leviathan sewers of eighteen thirty paris   to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave    now anyone in their right minds knows that the prairie town is  not paris france  such knowledge is particularly obvious to those who year after year live in such a town  the main irrigation ditch which still marks the southern boundary of creighton does not run through the middle of it like the seine through paris that ditch which then watered all the gardens and the small strawberry patches and corn and bean fields which filled every cistern filled under and beside every tiny wooden house through an intricate web of overgrown ditches supposedly clept clear kept clear  of weeds and wading widdling children by the one hired town worker who was all of the at the same time the constable the volunteer fire chief the dog catcher the wooden sidewalk repairman and the waterman   that ditch of reverse tributaries was certainly no seine river   the glazed clay and the much larger concrete sewer pipes which the workers of bennett and white limited edmonton nested in the sand fitted together and buried beneath the streets in nineteen fifty-two were nothing at all like the legendary architectured paris sewers begun somewhere in the middle ages and which in the nineteenth century had become both a grave and an asylum for crime intelligent social protest liberty of conscience and every conceivable human debauchery as hugo writes day and night   i know personally that most of the creighton sewers were too small even for a child to crawl into   not a single one of them was then large enough for a big man to walk in erect and leave alone carry another draped over his shoulder   and i at seventeen was certainly no no  bruneseau who in eighteen oh five would be the one man in all of napoleon's empire brave enough to enter the paris sewers and then spend seven years expanding their network  in fact when i was hired on the first day of the creighton  project in less than two months before it was completed i was fired  like everyone else bennett and white hired in creighton  i was a labourer a grunt when our work was mostly fitting and carrying things of digging them up or burying them in places designated by the foreman and various bosses all who came  all of whom came from somewhere else  a nice brainless business being a grunt  you just do everything anyone orders you because you're right down there at the bottom with the sewer pipe as low as you'll get without more digging which you'll have to do yourself   i however was a shade less grunty than most for some reason  because i could read and write  i can't remember anyone having asked me to demonstrate it  on the very first day the project engineer pointed at me and the  fat foreman said you go with him  so there i was frequently without a shovel riding about town  in the engineer's brown model a ford  a curiosity even then  the rod and chain man   while my fellow grunts heaved sand and gravel and cement into the grinding maw of a mixer or backfilled around pipe deep in the trench  or muscled clay joints and concrete manholes sectioned above the trucks i held a graduated stick motionless or anchored what i at first supposed was an endless measuring tape   hold it right there  don't move it  but quickly discovered it was a chain a steel chain certainly  but nothing at all like the one riveted around jean valjean's neck to march him to the prison galleys of toulon   if my life were a m massive   romance like les mis&eacute;rables where everyone especially the villains always and continuously return until all are either dead or married which in most romances not hugo's is amounts  to the same thing i would by now have met that engineer again   perhaps five years older than i a third year civil engineering student at the university of alberta on his summer job   his blond tough and compact body shorter than mine  his slightly lopsided grin with a tooth missing on the right side  but i cannot remember his name nor will he remember the gangly kid he left to lounge in the shade of his model a while the other grunts sweated and gasped in the burning sun and he argued with the foreman  i didn't lounge often for within two days i had learned the grunt's basic survival rules  one  never sit down   two  never stand with your hands in your pockets   but often the engineer did not need me and then i worked with the rest and that was when the others who were never told to sit in the model a got their small revenges on me  the heavy ends of the pipes  the extra shovelling where there was room for only one to work  the deepest mud after a rain when the huge planks supported  the trench walls oozed and bulged ominously between their horizontal braces   he was wading in the hideous muck of the city all dripping with slime   quote continues   the best trench workers quickly proved to be the older immigrant men who had somehow survived the war and had managed with what was left of their families to get into canada   those were the refugees displaced persons or d ps as they were called derisively or schmoes as we called them i don't even know how to spell that name word after the subhuman critters in the very popular little ab li'l   abner comic strip   they worked at anything without question   their lack of english saved them from the pr   the precise details of racism but it certainly did not save them from its pervasive abusive tone  that racism bothered me   mostly to be honest about it for myself   after all though born in canada i was of refugee parents myself  at home we had never spoken but an obscure german dialect a language i used to explain the foreman's peremptory orders to my fellow  mennonite d p labourers   but tired muscles and common sweat soon pushed such attitudes in a work gang aside   work hard enough together and you get to deci   deride a man not for his race but for his evasions for his laziness   it seems to me now that thinking back to that nineteen fifty-two  that male concepts about women are much harder to change than their prejudice about race   oh the summer girls walking by with their brief blouses knotted up under their breasts their white shorts their arms and legs week by week turning a deeper more olympic golden brown under that libidinous sun
