 hypothesis two the expertise of literary critics should enable them to pick up more textual clues and markers than non-experts do  hypothesis three critics versed in the cultural references of a particular text should respond differently to that text than those who are not as culturally informed  hypothesis four within the same critical circle there should be commonly held concepts and ways of reading a text  over the past few years i've aimed to establish the validity of these hypothesis hypotheses though my own  through my own empirical research  to accomplish this i've conducted a series of studies in which i had graduate students some of whom could be considered as expert readers analyze the same text using the same critical model of analysis  my objective was to see under these circumstances to what extent interpretations or readings would vary within and between groups  the independent variables tested were levels of expertise critical expertise including knowledge of the genre the critical model used and the corresponding linguistic and literary theories and knowledge of the culture in this case canadian and or quebecois culture  along with what i refer to all of these do  levels of domain knowledge i also sought to determine if the time factor was a sig was significant when analyzing the text  the sample text for all readers twenty-five in all was a play written about pre-war quebec by the quebecois writer playwright marie laberge  c'&eacute;tait avant le guerre &agrave; l'anse-&agrave;-gilles  the critic model was based upon greimas' system of functional analysis and pavis' commitaire  quantitative study of word or stage elements found in printed plays  my subjects were graduate students in canada and france with varying self-rated degrees of knowledge about dramatic analysis and the semiotics about the precise critical methodology used about canada and quebec and about quebec theatre   method  using an analytical grid the analytical grid adapted from the work of greimas an analytical grid adapted from the work of greimas and paris subjects were asked to analyze one scene one scene of the laberge play  they did this by dividing this scene into subscenes based on what they perceived of the different conflicts depicted in the text  they were asked to designate the subject the object and the opponent of these conflicts' spheres of action maybe three words and to describe the overall general atmosphere of the scene connotations later regrouped under convergences convergences created by the different theatrical or stage elements referred to in the text  the first of the three independent variables measured the results of spontaneous versus non-spontaneous reading  the remaining independent variables related to the scores obtained by the readers in relation to six different domains of knowledge  knowledge of canada knowledge of quebec knowledge of theatre knowledge of quebec theatre knowledge of linguistics or semiotics and knowledge of the critical model  i first compared results against the total scores obtained for the six domains of expertise  that is i used the overall expertise of the readers to compare the analysis of those obtaining high total knowledge scores against those with low total knowledge scores  i did this in order to see whether or not the more informed readers would answer differently than less informed ones   then i compared the readers' analysis in relation to each of the six domains of expertise  in this case i wanted to find out a if culture and knowledge cultural knowledge made a difference when reading a test a text that was culturally specific b if critical expertise whether it be dramatic criticism or semiotics lead high scoring readers to answer differently from low scoring ones and c if the choice and or knowledge of the methodology made a difference  i also ran a test to determine whether spontaneous reading by a group of subjects would be the same as that conducted by the same readers who had had time to read and think about the text  here are the results   spontaneous versus non-spontaneous  when i compared the analysis of those who noted down their interpretations as they were reading the text with those produced by students having had time to study the text i noted areas of agreement within and between both groups  spontaneous reactions to a text can be held in common and can be maintained over time  nevertheless there were some con  inconsistencies two words with spontaneous reading  over time a few readers also changed their minds as to the meaning of a text   in the case of the two independent of the two dependent variables subjects opponents time led to more coherent readings of the text  when designating objects and convergences those who had more time that is the non-spontaneous readers entered more responses than did the spontaneous group  for example the non-spontaneous group supplied more objects and more convergences than did the spontaneous group  conclusion   and of course this is all very summarized form  time makes a difference  not surprising  it leads readers to change their minds about the meanings of a text to produce more consistent analysis of what they have read and to propose more varied and more nuanced analysis  i'm going to go to what you have as uhm four point three  instead of four point two for the first and i'll go back to four point two  critical expertise overall knowledge   when comparisons against the overall knowledge levels of the reading subjects were conducted a complex pattern was revealed of overlap and agreement coupled with opposing nuances and outright contradictions  on the one hand informed readers agree on several points with non-informed readers  that is there were some commonly held perceptions  on the other hand those who were most informed selected a larger number of types of objects and convergences than did the less informed group where choices were more spread out and basically less consistent within the group  conclusion  informed readers and non-informed readers disagree as to the relative importance of the different types of possible answers  the concepts of those with high levels of overall knowledge are more differentiated their readings more nuanced than those of the less informed readers  to put it another way the more you know the more you have to say  this is certainly a reassuring conclusion for those of us who make a living from having a lot to say and saying it in such a way as to imply   that we're that we are revealing new truths to those who may be listening  but more significantly it points to the importance of overall domain-related knowledge and the differentiation of expert and non-expert readers  now we'll go to specifics  critical expertise knowledge of the critical model   when i compared the work of readers who were not instructed as to the use of the actual critical model with that of well-instructed readers results showed that there was generally no consistent pattern of response within the non- insis instructed group  moreover by none of my measures did the non-instructed group agree with the instructed group  for example readers with high levels of this type of domain knowledge designated subjects and opponents more often and more logically than did those with little knowledge of the model  in the same way subjects with high levels of domain knowledge also designated more objects and more convergences than did than did those with low levels of knowledge of the critical model   conclusion  knowledge of the process seems to make a difference both as a distinguishing factor between experts and non-experts and as a means of differentiating experts from each other  knowledge of the critical methodology distinguishes readers from each other  it is also sufficient condition to allow readers to produce more levels of meaning  in this case more convergences than objects   critical expertise knowledge of theatre and or dramatic criticism  the comparison of those with high levels of knowledge and or dramatic criticism and those with low levels of this type of critical expertise produce interesting results which correlate with the finding for measures of overall knowledge  informed readers agreed in some points identified by non-informed readers  informed readers generally analyze texts differently than do non-informed readers  answers in the low level group differed by as much as fifty percent by those of the high level group  informed readers isolate more elements of meaning than do non-informed readers and perhaps consequently informed readers disagree more between themselves than do non-informed readers   conclusion  knowledge of the genre makes a difference  it differentiates informed and non-informed readers and informed readers against themselves  there can be some agreement between the two groups but overall those with relevant domain knowledge performed differently than those without this type of knowledge  domain specific critical expertise is what differentiates expert readers from non-expert readers and from each other  at least one might think that until we get to a knowledge of semiotics another kind of expertise  perhaps the most surprising result of my research was that produced by the comparison between those possessing semiotic knowledge with those with low levels of this particular type of critical expertise  one could have expected these readers to behave as expert readers that is to reply differently than the non-expert group and to provide more layers of meaning  but this is not what i found  responses were essentially the same for both groups  the high knowledge group  i don't know if i should audience laughter leave now   the high knowledge group designated about as many objects as did the low knowledge group and both groups selected ah almost the same number of convergences  conclusion   being high highly informed about literature or literary theory in general is not a significant factor when analyzing a specific genre or using a specific methodology  knowing about literary theory does not allow readers to produce more detailed analysis or different readings than those of non-informed readers  expert knowledge of theatre and dramatic criticism is what is required to differentiate literary critics of drama from non-expert readers  knowledge about semiotics apparently only generally relates to the specific application of the greimasian model to theatre and is therefore not enough to differentiate these critics from non-experts   cultural expertise knowledge of canada or quebec   although canadians and quebecois experts offered more levels of meaning than a non-informed groups group those with high levels of knowledge about canada or quebec did not differ amongst themselves as to the meaning of the different types of analysis  moreover whether they knew about canada or about quebec these readers distinguished themselves from those who knew less about canada or quebec by proposing far more objects and far more convergences  conclusion   cultural expertise leads readers to form more numerous and more consistent opinions on the meaning of a text related to the culture about which they are knowledgeable   might tell us something about uhm national or regional interpretations of national or regional literatures    readers with knowledge of the culture to which the text is related produce more meanings than less informed readers do but more consistent and fewer than the other texts maybe three words   critical and cultural expertise knowledge of quebec theatre  quebec theatre as opposed to theatres just by itself  knowledge of quebec theatre turned out to be a maybe two words produced complex and surprising results  there was some agreement between the two groups although the informed group produced more answers than did the non-informed group  however when compared with those knowledgeable about canada or quebec this high knowledge group that is readers with high   know know knowledge levels   of cultural and critical expertise designated fewer objects and convergences than did the culturally aware group  this implies yet again that there is a fine line to be drawn between different types and levels of expertise and there might even be a type of expertise such as the case here which read lead   readers to draw more concise and succinct conclusions than will not more na&iuml;ve readers do  conclusion  as with the high cultural knowledge group readers with high levels of knowledge about the culture and the genre did not differ much within their own group although their responses differed in number and kind from the low level group
