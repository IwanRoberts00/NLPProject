 so that you know all the possible mathematical angles you need to then collect  after that you take a measurement and we'll use eight feet as the distance from the gate to the shutter   and at eight feet you take a measurement say that's what the distance is  you put your camera at eight feet and you take focus   it should be in focus  if it's not in focus that means it's not calibrated properly but you film it anyhow  before you film you write on a piece of tape aside starts  obviously not to ruin the chart aside ends eight feet   that way when you watch the film you'll know what the focus is  and if it's soft if it's off if it's completely correct it'll be on the film  the next thing you do is you take that off  you readjust your focus so that it's out of focus   at the same position that you were in without moving anything you redo the focus by eye and you write on the chart or on the piece of tape  by eye   that way you can then see on the film the difference between your eye and the measurement  if both of them are exactly the same the lens is calibrated correctly and you're not forced to take measurements on set when you're running out of time  if you know the lens is right you can just do it by eye   but  asks a question   but if your eye's not calibrated then you have to do the measurement  if the measurement's not calibrated you have to do it by eye  hopefully both are   because that way when you have to do any kind of focus pulling  in a dolly shot or in a crane shot you know that you can count on your measurements  otherwise you have to take marks by eye and in no lighting situations it's harder to tell your focus at f two than it is at f sixteen  comments   so if you know that the calibration's correct for both then that leaves it up to you as the camera assistant or the operator to make that decision  comments   but if you know it's not  comments   then you know you're trapped in the situation of either by eye or by measurement loud zipper being done up   preferably by eye because you can trust your eye  comments   yeah  so then after you got those two measurements by eye and then  by the measuring tape the next step is to test the latitude of your focus  so you would then place the eight feet sign back on and  write could be 'right' next to it a plus  and go slightly over the focus so you're at eight and a half feet and film it for about five feet worth of film  then stop put another plus sign  film it again for another five feet   this time maybe at nine feet  knowing that depth of focus is one third two thirds behind you're probably gonna going to have less focus in front of the subject  but let's say that it is in focus then you know you've got a lot of latitude on the slant and it's better in real life situations  then you do it with minus which is the exact opposite and you go to seven and a half feet and then again to seven feet with minus minus  once that's done you've tested the lens and you can put it away  but you have to do that for each lens  the only part where this becomes more work is when you're working with the zoom lens cos you have to test it at different points on the zoom  test it wide which means you're gonna going to  have to move the camera in   do all your measurements at wide  then move the camera back out do it word  the twenty-five thirty-five or fifty millimetres which are common lenses to be used  and then move it back out further  go telephoto and do it at either one hundred or ninety somewhere in there  so that you know that the entire range of the lens and how the opticals are working so that you feel comfortable on set  once that test is done you're finished with your lenses  and then the next test is your registration and  word   asks a question   well what happens with the zoom lens  comments   we you ge only with   the zoom  what happens when you go out right you're gonna  going to have to change your distance for each lens  because what happens is if i'm standing here and i have a wide  ten millimetre lens i'm gonna going to see the whole chart  so i'm not gonna going to be able to test my focus in here  comments   so then i would bring it into the closest point of focal distance that i have  comments   which may be two feet so maybe five feet  comments   and try to get my focus there  and do it so that i have more smaller lines in it so that i can see the clearness of the definition  because that's what tests you definition how sharp the lens is  the lens can be in focus but it could be very dull focus right  and you would prefer to have a sharp focus and a clear image  so the idea being that you would bring it closer depending on what the lens is  but when you're working with a zoom lens what happens is when i'm at twenty-five i could be here  but when i go wide i see the whole room so i have to move it in  but when i go telephoto i can't get focus because it's just too close so i have to move back  comments   well to have as much of a variety of lines and different images in it like small and large  what happens is if you go to word or michel trudel film production facility there they have a tripod that's bolted into the ground with a camera  comments   and it's just a flowing chart on a pulley sytem   and it's got a box in it that lights itself and then you just move the chart with the little rope at the distance you need  wait for it to stop moving do your test and then send it out or bring it in  so that you aren't gonna going to do tests generally at the university you're gonna going to   do them at the rental houses  and they have everything there for you  asks a question   the prime  it depends if i have a fifty millimetre prime i can be  further away and get the image like that  asks a question   well it depends  if i'm a twenty-five mil millimetre lens i have to move closer to fill the screen with the image  and the thirty-five mil millimetre lens it's roughly the same i don't have to move  but if i go to a fifty all i'm gonna going to  get is this  asks a question   well one distance per lens  depending on the lens right  some lenses can be  like twelve and ten are the same  twenty-five twenty-six thirty-five they're the same  fifty is on it's own  seventy-five you're gonna going to have to move back even further  one twenty even further  two hundred you're gonna going to have to be about across the room  comments, asks a question   y you you just  wanna want to take one corner  comments   or in the centre  cos it just repeats itself  the only time you ever hold chart is when you're at a five point nine   comments   which is official and you're not gonna  going to see anything anyhow   even just clean then that's all right  comments   and so that's the uh lens  any other questions chair sliding on the floor   asks a question   that's the problem  you can only get so close right  i mean you can only get three feet  and at three feet i'm gonna going to  have a whole chart  so you get as close as you can   interrupts   yeah yeah  comments   sure  you have to get as close as possible noises of trolley being moved start   like there's only a limited focus you have on that lens  comments   ah depends  see what happens with a five point nine or a fisheyed lens is you need to have more light to have better focus   cos there is one focus point on it   but that like the focus point could be two feet it could be five feet it could be one foot  but depending if you're shooting at an f sixteen  about 12 seconds, due to trolley noises   but the more light you have the better focus you have   the less light you have the further away you're gonna  going to be from the subject of focus noises of trolley being moved end   so we'll do it with  if you can get three or four one k lights right on the chart  you could bring your lens really close and do it  but generally the fisheye the best way to test it is just to look through it  run around the room with it you'll be fine  but because i mean if it's in focus when you're got it and you can see it it's the best you're gonna going to get cos  asks a question   see that's the difference between the university and  outside  in the university three other crews will use your lens and maybe four other crews will use your camera  asks a question   because if you do the test outside of university  right where it really counts   and you're paying two thousand a day for the camera gear  and a hundred and fifty dollars a day for a lens to two hundred dollars a day for a lens  word the right stuff  but if you're the camera technician it's not even your money right  it's someone else's money   right  asks a question   why are you doing the tests here  because if everybody does the test together and you get a report on the equipment and you know what is good with the equipment and what's bad with the equipment  then when you get the camera equipment you can then make reference to the original test and test you do that day and see what's on what's off  and then say well i decide not to use this  or hey marc-pierre word right  but if you go blind because it's your own money coming out of this you have a greater chance of losing  like a friend of mine didn't do a camera test when i was here  he shot it with the eclair type of movie camera   he didn't have the gate adjusted and new black and white film stock came out  it shaved off the first layer of emulsion throughout the entire gate   five thousand dollars worth of film   he spent two weeks shooting  it destroyed an entire film and the university said well he didn't test the equipment sorry  so basically it's for insurance  what happens is on a production outside of the university you do the test you look at it  if everything's okay you give it to the production staff they give it to the insurance company right away  then the insurance can then say to the lab hey something went wrong here but our cameras are okay  so the lab made a mistake you owe us  and one production day is something like forty thousand dollars a day in value  with all the staff all the equipment set design transportation gas actors word   so that's why you do the test  asks a question   well this is the best way to do it  watch their rushes  the last shoot that went out watch their rushes  look at their camera reports  if things are out of focus possibly or one mag keeps scratching and making uhm just any kind of bizarre marks on the film that isn't inherently good  you know ask them  they should have made reports labelled the mags know which one's doing it right  and then you can benefit off their mistakes and have the camera test predone for you  but then again a camera test is usually done twenty-four forty-eight hours before shooting  asks a question   it's done in colour  you don't print the film  asks a question   no you just watch the negative  and it's free  asks a question   yeah you just go over to the lab and say i'd like my camera  test printed  in about two hours they'll print it you go back and you watch it on their projector  and you say thank you you take it and you leave  so i mean it's an hour and a half's work in the industry it pays a hundred and fifty dollars and for you it could save a film
