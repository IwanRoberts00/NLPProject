 a two-man advantage for calgary and johnson got credit for the goal   simpson to face off   simpson ready to face off against johnson  there's some kind of uh material at centre ice or something  a few words   a couple dinosaurs are hollering for the linesman to go get it   just some broken ice  laugh   just a bunch of broken ice   well a bit of a snow pack   here's haven off the draw  todd johns johnson   thompson the shot   and the save by dawkins  a nice draw win by simpson and thompson in the slot didn't get a whole lot of wood on it and dawkins down quickly  he goes down a lot  and there's a lot of rebounds tonight  the bears have got to get  after that initial shot somebody's got to get to that net cos there's some uh uh open net goals sitting there for em them    calgary has some decent-sized defencemen   ruark six three   he's one of their bigger boys  dinosaurs lose it off the draw  here's simpson in the slot  poking into the corner  thompson feeds it off to colin zarowny   they battle in there and schonek comes up with it  schonek will take it behind the net   marlborough tying up simpson who was trying to forecheck for it  flint gets to the line  his shot sails wide of the net   and thompson there to knife it ahead  colin zarowny  last minute in the period  ahead to simpson  simpson will dump it in  goes deep to the corner  after it there is colin zarowny  drops it off for simpson  now thompson left circle with the shot  that one off a skate wide of the net   dinosaurs' couldwell being checked  bears trying to come up with it  two guys went after it and the puck had come free   and the dinosaurs are able to clear   goodkey now  he lost it  here's a chance for krywulak  it's poked away by masson   johnson trying to work it up the boards  drops it off for krywulak  there's a man open in front   pass doesn't get through  back to the point now  masters right side for marlborough  out front for johnson  johnson shot  he hammered one over top the net  off the glass it went up the boards  bears in trouble in their own end as krywulak comes in with high hit on jickling   bears flip it high in the air and out to centre ice  ten seconds to go in the period  ziliniak will send it back in  pullishy back to play it  five seconds to go  that should do it for the period as pullishy dumps it up the open wing  and the buzzer sounds to end period number one  bears in big trouble in that last minute of play in their own end  and the difference between this weekend and last weekend we could just see in that last shift uh couldwell made a bad play going back in his own end  simpson took it out  the puck's sittin sitting there for colin zarowny  instead of taking it and looking for the man like he would have done last week he decided to hit couldwell again and the dinos got the puck  and uh uh they're just not playing it as smart as they did  last weekend   kevin schmalz who didn't see one second of ice time in that period went out and dumped the bears' uh jickling i believe it was after the players are milling about  word   so he's out there to stretch his legs and he laugh  is out there doing it to one of the bears' top players   i guess a smart move from calgary's standpoint but uh i mean if they're going to mess with you why don't they send one of their gunners out there to mess with one of your gunners   ya i don't know ev   it's chess game here  who knows  who knows the reasons these things happen   the goal scoring in that period todd johnson on the powerplay at four thirteen  couldwell and krywulak with assists  it was a two-man advantage a five-on-three powerplay and that was the only goal of the period  the shots on goal in that period we'll get for you in just a moment  the shots for calgary nine and for alberta six  so we thank the people here for that information   so for calgary nine  alberta six   one nothing the score  jeff two powerplays for both teams and the difference i think was clearly that five-on-three advantage that calgary got  bears woulda would have had one too if terry degner hadn'ta hadn't have taken that penalty  ya i mean the the ref did even things up there and w and the bears would have had a minute oh two with the five-on-three which is a   a great opportunity and uh deigs is probably a little bit upset at himself right now  let's take a time-out come back and hear from mike thompson in our first intermission  it's the calgary dinosaurs one the alberta golden bears no score in canada west university playoff hockey action  game two of this best of three division final from the clare drake arena in calgary on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight  commercials, interviews, and analysis in the intermission, 13 min 20 sec   and so the second period moments away here  masson leads the bears out  dawkins leads calgary out   and really if you recap that first like we've tried to do here dawkins was not forced to make a lot of saves  only six and maybe one real nice one and that was off mike thompson   and uh thompson didn't get great wood on it  but it was right off a faceoff win by ken simpson and thompson  corralled the puck and flipped it toward the net  didn't get all the wood on it he would have liked but uh  dawkins stopped it anyway  and he and he gave up some juicy rebounds though  he hasn't looked that sharp in stopping uh even the easiest shots  and and the bears gotta   have got to uh hope they get some better chances on him and get guys going to the net for rebound   two teams will be even-strength off the start of the second  the bears send the law firm out there zarowny zarowny and simpson   and calgary counters with johnson couldwell and krywulak their top line   and the dinosaurs have the puck off the faceoff  ruark working from his own end  up the right-wing boards he goes  hammers it in across the line  round and round it goes  up the left wing now for johnson   sends it to the corner to couldwell  back to johnson  he fell on the play   the bears are able to clear  here's simpson down the wing   simpson on the right side  flipped it off the linesman  chops it into the corner now  was hit by masters  colin zarowny looking for it  racing in from the point is hjertaas   puts it in behind the net to the left corner for simpson  simpson will chip it deep into the zone for colin zarowny  he had it batted away and krywulak shovels it out to centre ice  bears send it right back in  here's simpson just inside the blue line  flips one toward the net  saved by dawkins  and then aaron zarowny smashes his man as ruark tried to clear  here they come though the dinosaurs  this is johnson to centre   johnson with the puck moves in  lets a shot go  and boy did he hammer that thing wide  they score off the rebound   it went off the glass and johnson raced over and slammed it in to the open net as masson came diving across in a desperate bid to  stop that thing  he let a rocket go and everybody watched it  exactly evan   everybody watched it  the reaction time there is not what it has to be   two defencemen were back and masson could have reacted faster  he didn't react till he saw johnson uh lining up the rebound  and the two defencemen just stood and watched the rebound come out  and uh johnson's got a wicked shot for a small guy  but uh there's no way in the world he should have had a rebound that juicy  johnson his second of the playoffs   second of the night   it comes at the fifty-four second mark here of the second period  there's haney for it  now ahead to esposito  drops it back for pullishy   pullishy working from his own zone  skates to centre  flips it deep into the corner   esposito gets to it  he lets a shot go  comes back to the left point   here is pullishy  a long shot missed the net   and that's an unassisted goal for johnson  bears have it  here's strand  across the line for haney  haney moves in  shoots  saved by dawkins  nice stop  his best of the night  as haney got all that one and dawkins well out to challenge  made it a fine glove save  dawkins had to come up with a good save for once and he did  uh really nice  nice pass touch pass backhand by paul strand  and uh good wood by haney  he put his head down and ripped it  and dawkins when he saw haney put his head down he came out and uh was able to make the save  a nice glove save by dawkins   draw will be to the stick-hand side of the calgary goaltender  last night the bears went up two nothing and lost the game  tonight the dinosaurs are up by a pair   bears are gonna going to have   to face adversity tonight and come back  so anything can happen   uh not only the series could be over they're down two nothing  it's going to be tough   jickling on the faceoff against calgary's townsend  and townsend won that one  goes back into the corner for steveson  left corner for zulyniak and he plays it up the wing for marble  marble chipping it out to centre for stephenson  stephenson can't get around jickling   puck deep in the bears' zone   still it's cleared out to centre  just out of the reach of thompson  two nothing calgary in front here early in the second  long lead pass for schmalz  he's in on the bear defender christiansen who took him out  christiansen plays it ahead and away goes thompson  he's across the line  thompson takes a look  thompson feeding it out front   nobody there for alberta and the dinosaurs'll just send it down the ice  that went off the linesman otherwise it might have been icing  adair now up the wall ahead for degner and he steers it in across the the calgary line  dawkins stops it for marble   marble a long breakaway pass for the bear line but that's picked off by hjertaas  hjertaas will step across the line  in for colin zarowny  zarowny lets a shot go  and that's deflected to the corner by townsend  now a cross-ice feed to the right point  snapshot by simpson  he broke his stick on it or it was blocked in part by townsend who lost his stick on it and it dribbles in to goaltender dawkins  that's the best the bears have looked all night since that second goal by the dinos  two good shifts in a row  first by jickling's line and now zarowny's line  the law firm came out and they're playing well   they gotta have got to keep the green wave going on the dinos and uh get some flow and get some momentum going their way  draw will be to the glove-hand side of dawkins   aaron zarowny to face off against thompson  and aaron zarowny waved outta out of  there   colin zarowny now to take the draw   bears have it  here's hjertaas with a shot  pad save dawkins   he had problems with it but he covers it up   another thing here too jeff on these faceoffs is that if you're the home team it makes a difference as to who puts their stick down first  isn't it supposed to at least  uh or it's the defensive zone  and uh like i i believe the defensive zone centre has to put their uh stick down first
