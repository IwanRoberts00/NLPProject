 introduction audience claps   now i don't know why the hell i'm here  we can forget culture as a resource  not really audience laughs   cos i'm a writer  i create illusory people and i uh  writers're often asked uh what do you do with a novel  do you blueprint it do you block it out and plot it and then do it over   well you don't  what you do with your illusory people is you find   em them first   they you find them you prospect for them  this is where the business of culture or arts as a resource  comes in   uh you find them in your own stored actual past   but very soon after finding these life models you gotta  got to take a creative leap   indeed i'm my second son read in since daisy creek uh i kinda kind of got corrupted over the years and there's an explicit sex scene in that novel  audience laughs   takes place with a professor in a university on a bed of mid-term papers audience laughs   when i finished it i uh said to my son who knows how i teach creative writing and that you must work out about a biography and knew about it he said geez dad i hope that was a creative leap audience laughs   i said it sure as hell was hewey  it's the biggest creative leap i've ever taken audience laughs  but you take this creative leap and you have to  even though your people have become fictional and the events unreal  you have to believe these unreal people   because to a certain extent they dicterate  they dictate what is going to happen in your fiction  now this isn't a healthy thing to do every day uh every month every year audience laughs   uh uh not only that as like many psychologists with their real people mine are almost always in trouble   uh i'm concerned with them in those times when life has become incandescent with stress with conflict uh love hate greed  generosity pride snobbery birth death marriage divorce success failure   now neither life nor art which is an illusion of life are simple  it's not either or  it's accord of comic and tragic  bad writing is either slapstick farce or it's melodrama or it's opera and i won't go into that then audience laughs   my wife has p a sense of perfect pitch  she thinks opera is wonderful but it does show to the worst writing ever done by man audience laughs   now a famous canadian doctor wilder penfield  searching was searching for an explanation of epilepsy  his sister had been had suffered  from it  and at the montreal neurological institute he was   he had a patient she was fully conscious and he had an electric stimulator probe and and was   touching uh stimulating certain parts of the cortex trying to find uhm a growth uh uh an injury something that would explain the seizures  while he was doing this she heard somebody singing   she recognized the tune she recognized the lyrics and it was her mother's voice  and as well the recall experience was in detailed and total context  emotionally   they established that she couldn't even have been three years old at that time  that's when he stumbled across the fact   th this started the idea of the bicameral brain   and it gives new importance to the caves of the subconscious where each human has stored a unique and individual past   and we know that thanks to wilder penfield that nothing which bombards a human brain is ever lost  it may be forgotten but it's not  now that's the resource   that's the unrefined resource  it's called life   it's smells sights sounds touches bits of people  emotions and you've got to prospect that stored re  resource   so i'm not too far off the thing here because the important thing about that art resource for a writer of short stories plays poems novels there's an important geographic dimension to it  and that dimension has its effect during the litmus years of childhood when somebody is stained  so boy if you're north of the forty-ninth parallel and i'm not far north during those affecting years for me when i built up my resources out of which i might refine uh i'm not a practicing poet but plays novels short stories  now as a child for the first twelve years i wandered over the prairie a great deal with the prairie wind dirging for me through the great prairie harp of telephone wires   they hummed they twanged and they seemed to endlessly adjust themselves against the prairie stillness  i can remember barbed wire fences and impaled on the barbs were butterflies grasshoppers earthworms maybe field mice  it was the shrike's supermarket shrike is a type of bird   audience laughs   and in the winter and earlier than that   they did it on the buffalo berry bushes with those sharp thorns  and in the winter i could f read bird prints on the snow the alternating dog tracks of a coyote or the domino ones of jackrabbits and they all signalled animal life to me not human life  again and again the skipping lift of a prairie meadowlark's song surprised me and in my new world at a very young age i learned i was mortal  i could die   the end of billy mitchell  that's probably the biggest thing i uncovered in the way of  an art resource for me  now when you learn you're gonna going to   die you truly understand you're human  you've been then given a perspective which is very helpful in deciding what is important and what is unimportant what is valuable and what is not valuable  a sense of one's own mortality does clarify priorities  the greek not the one who had the commercial cafe in wayburn another one named soc socrates said that the unexamined life isn't worth living  audience laughs   now there's an old prairie expression and i think it's still valid for the north and for fort macmurray i'm sure  says much the same thing don't you eat that there stuff elmer  it's horseshit audience laughs audience claps   the point is in your conference here challenge north  man doesn't live by reason and common sense alone  the simply intellectual life is not worth living either and the most valuable resource a nation has is that one uncovered by wilder penfield when he worked with the epileptic patient   you see art is the only thing humans do for its own sake uh besides the act of love audience laughs   this explains perhaps the great part that the arts play in culture  humans are the only animals who make poems plays novels drama  they are the only animals who paint dance sing sculpt compose  artists philosophers historians research scientists they know  that man is a finite warm sack of vulnerability  because of this knowledge they have an affair   unfair advantage over politicians and generals and quarterbacks and the heads of dow united fruit hooker chemicals audience laughs several times during pauses   cos see art's the only thing man does for its own sake  it doesn't involve an adversary relationship   there are no winners over losers no victors over vanquished  soviet over american toreador over bull  creative partners to artists who look and wonder at a painting or a play or a ballet or who listen to a symphony and since myrna isn't here even opera don't take anything from the artist  audience laughs   the book isn't taken from the author both partner and artist win through shared pity and terror compassion and empathy  laughter and tears   death and solitude justify art  they make it important   which draws human aliens together in the mortal family and unites them against the heart of darkness  humans must comfort each other defend each other against the terror of being human   there's a civilized accountability to others  the coyote the jackrabbit and the badger and the killdeer and the weasel they don't have it  okay so this is challenge north  so i wanna want to share with you a refined thing that came out of the autobiographical that i prospected my stored past of smells sights sounds tastes touches feelings and took a creative leap  very frequently it isn't a very large leap  it stays very close to the unrefined resource  now let's refine a little bit further from a autobiography  it's from a novel called how i spent my summer holidays   introduction   when you look at us as a biologist does we're not very impressive  we're not very fast   the uh any elephant can outrun the fastest human being on earth  we're not exceptionally strong   we're not gifted with special sensory aculit  acuity   we're not uh gifted with i with any   word and yet we have become the dominant species on this planet  the most numerous mammal on earth   our major survival trait of course is a huge and complex brain  a brain that enabled us to recognize patterns in nature   things like the regularity of the tides of the seasons of animal migration plant succession  as fran&ccedilla;ois jacob has said the human brain has a built-in need for order   and by creating order out of chaos we were able to uh anticipate events and to exploit that anticipation by uh wi  through our predictive capacities for our greater survival   thus from that human brain emerged the concept of  future  of course the future doesn't exist it's not real it only exists as an invention of the human brain  but because we invented an idea like a future it gifted us as no other animal has on this planet with choice  we can deliberately choose from a variety of options and thereby plot our way into a number of different kinds of futures  and for ninety-nine percent of our existence on earth that strategy worked  we were able to flourish and yet at the same time nature  seemed infinitely abundant and endlessly self-renewing   today we can see before our eyes that nature is no longer as vast as it alway tape cuts out briefly nor is it as resilient as it has been in the past   yet today with all of the amplified brain power of global telecommunications with computers with scientists and engineers we no longer seem able to do what our ancestors did  to act deliberately by choosing an option that would give us the highest survival attribute or possibility  and the question that we have to ask ourselves is why  why do we seem so paralyzed today  i've already participated in two days of preliminary discussions here at global forum and i'm afraid that it's clear that we still haven't established a discussion that deals with the fundamental context within which we can assess the human place in the planetary ecosphere  we are still so caught up in hu tape cuts out briefly  that we fail to recognize our absolute needs as biological beings  in the discussions that i've heard about the north versus the south in the need for greater input from women from youth from the handicapped and indigenous people there is little acknowledgement first of all that we are part of the web of life that contains perhaps thirty million other species   we are above all human animals   as dependent on air water soil and biological diversity as any other living things  these life support systems air water soil and biodiversity  are what make our societies possible  but today they are being torn apart by human numbers by poverty and technological muscle power  science can not begin to comprehend the vast diversity of living organisms on earth and their interactions with each other and the physical properties of the world  yet we hack away at nature as if it is infinitely renewable  and we pour our industrial excreta into life support systems   as if somehow air water soil can absorb dilute and detoxify these poisons indefinitely  we know for a fact that human activity is now creating change on a global scale that is unprecedented in scope and speed   our species is now increasing in numbers at the rate of three people a second and that rate is itself accelerating  agricultural topsoil is being degraded at the rate of twenty-five billion tonnes a year  and global food production can not be substantially increased by any of the de advances in biotechnology  industrial toxins many of them novel and hence nonbiodegradable are being poured into air water and soil at horrifying rates  in the united states alone over two billion kilograms a year  tape cuts out briefly air water and soil
