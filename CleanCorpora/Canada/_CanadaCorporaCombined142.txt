there been tensions <  i would lie if i said no  okay  uh there have been because everbody wants to have their say  have you ever taken a swing at anybody  no laugh   oh okay  well that's good then  you're ahead of the game   not yet anyway laugh   laugh yeah well call if you do  we'd love to hear about it  laugh   no actually it's been pretty civil uh  the only thing is we're having a wedding on a friday which uh is something else for a lot of people  because i have a lot of   oh i betcha bet you your grandmother didn't like that   no  my grandmother's quite religious and it you know  it has to be on a saturday  if it's not on a saturday then you know there's something wrong  but uh she's come around  and now it's uh  she's come she's liking the idea of having it on a friday night and  in fact it's going to be the thirtieth of june which turns into the first of july so  it's going to be one big party  mmm hmm  and you're you're having it at the fort matthew club  what a nice choice  mmm hmm  i'm actually i'm very lucky because when we had thirty-five people henry and i had chosen the place  and then when we  actually it actually increased to seventy people  and uh we looked at each other and said oh my god we're not going to go through you know looking through a place again  um hum  so we uhm called up marriage &agrave; la carte  and i spoke to anne   and we went in and we sat down with her  and she was great because she told us exactly   this is your this is your wedding coordinator right   you bet   you bet   that's basically what she does   yeah   and we sat down with her and uh she told us exactly what she did  and she disappeared for about two minutes  we looked at each other  we said yes definitely  so that night we gave her a cheque a deposit and away we went and she found us a place  boy that that's amaz   of course these people are calming earthquakes right  laugh   her face probably didn't even change at all when you told her about the the what  you were up against  oh no  she's great  yeah  oh yeah  and she has  she knows the details down pat  are you enjoying this  yes i am  i am  there's a lot of work to be done but i'm enjoying it very much  yeah  no scary moments eh   yeah   uhm  scary moments i think that'll be the day when it comes where actually the uh  we're we're going to be doing it a day beforehand  going through everything at the church  and uh i think i'll be a little bit scared that day  i'll tell you what one bit of advice  the only bit i can give  mmm hmm  don't watch four weddings and a funeral the night before  laugh   alright you just  you won't go through it if you watch that film  okay   okay  ah could we could we talk to you every once in a while  and get a bit of a diary from you as the  as the day gets closer  sure   sure sounds good  and if i'm really nice i might get an invitation to the wedding right  laugh   good to talk to you sandra   thank you very much  good luck to you  thank you  bye  bye   hi welcome home  it's good to be back  tell me about the new album because it really is a departure  yonder tree is not the gino vinelli montrealers have come to know and love over the last twenty years  no it uh well not typically but you know it's something i've been aching to do for the last twenty years  to put an acoustic jazz band together and to uh to  sort of uhm record a genre of music that i was  that i grew up with   uh you know some artists have done it  carly simon and harry connick and natalie cole  and i appreciate that but i i wanted to do something that was perhaps in that genre but but   create new material new lyrics new thoughts  so don't make it a nostalgia album  it it's not a nostalgia album   at all   yeah   it's just uh  it relates or perhaps is influenced by an era of music but it's not really that era at all  tell me about some of the influences you did grow up with  some of the singers you uh you were very fond of and   and wanted to recreate what what  you'd been hearing for so many years  well my my dad was the person who was the liason between the jazz and the big band area era    and and in my generation  he introduced me to the likes of all the croon singers  of of the time including tony bennett and sinatra and  and a plethora of those kinds of singers  and and uh also the joe williams and the sarah vaughns and the ella fitzgeralds  and uh also the big bands and and the quartets the quintets the dave brubecks the uh coltranes and miles davis so on and so forth  so i was really pretty well inun inundated   with uh a lot of that that kind of music  so it was in my blood and it really stirred me because it was always challenging to play and challenging to really appreciate  uhm  tell me about the pieces falling into place to make the album happen after all these years of having it ruminate up here  well you have to you have to make a place for art  art doesn't happen on its own  you have to clear the path with a machete  especially if you want to especially if you want to get it out there to the public  it has to be a conscious effort where you have to court the muse  within yourself   mmm hmm   and you also have to court the muses of of  manufacturing  so you get yourself a position where you have enough of perhaps commercial success or enough of a name or enough credibility  and then you take the shot and say i need to do what i need to do  and lo and behold because you're courting the muse at the right time all the doors open for you and you're you're   it's as if heaven opens the door for you to say go ahead  hmm  do what you need to do  geez was there was there one defining moment when this happened to you  eh can you think of a   well eh   i think uh a growing feeling of malaise within myself  a feeling of aching boredom with with   uh popular music and that it was very repetitive  and i needed to to stretch myself to challenge myself both lyrically and vocally and  and put a real good jazz group together and uh  i went up to portland and i did uh i did   just that  and it was a hell of a time  i felt like a kid again  yeah  yeah  was it a little scary walking into the studio the first time  well yeah  i built my own studio up in portland   yeah   so ah  but i mean with a with a new experience  the sense you had word   oh i was so convinced  yeah  i was so convinced that i was doing was what i had to be doing  what i wanted to be doing  hmm  cos i was gonna going to ask you about shifting gears uh in the type of music you would be recording and whether that would be   well i shifted gears uh psychologically emotionally maybe a good five or six years ago  uhm hmm  after the recording of the last album uh the inconsolable man album  yeah  i i just didn't really want to record pop albums anymore  i just had no interest  and i i turned thirty-eight thirty-nine at the time and  part of part of it is just you know biological  maybe it's a midlife music crisis  i don't know  but uh i'm not uhm different from any other man who's   who's asked himself the same questions at late thirties or early forties  and so i started really realizing you know the uh the terrific uh finiteness to everything  and i said well if i'm gonna going to  do what i really wanna want to i've gotta  got to get to it  hmm  and that was it  times yeah you're getting to that that   halfway point where uh  yeah  yeah  and and then i uh  i'm enjoying it thoroughly because it's again it's a challenge for me and to to broaden myself harmonically uh rhythmically vocally lyrically and uh  i can't think of a better medium to do it in  tell me about uh the the uh the atmosphere in studio  uh you said yourself you didn't want to create a nostalgia album  in the uh you know natalie cole did  no not at all   albeit a really wonderful album   ah it was great  i agree yes   it's a great album but it was a nostalgia album  yes  tell me about the attitude and the the   sense of uh atmosphere you wanted to create in the studio with  with uh a classic jazz album   well you get   well you get musicians who are aware of that era of music that can play you know the miles classics and and all the classics written by cole porter and so on and so forth  and the guys who can go the modal way like coltrane did in love supreme  and guys who are very advanced you know musically  but then you get the same guys who are very well aware of pop music and who have a pop sensibility because they're younger people who grew up with the beatles and so on and so forth as we did  so that combination's a very very difficult combination to find but when you do find uh you find it you can find some real magic because you know exactly how to to  take and leave what's been done before  and to change it and twist it  and to redefine it  and to re-colour it  and this is precisely what we aim to do on on  this album  for instance walter whitman is a song that has is  from a genre of music with with the sweeping brushes and some of the chord changes  but i twisted some of the chord changes and  and put em them in another   on another level other than just a uh you know crooning ballad  and lyrically i decided to make you know the uh what would be easily a swoon song about you know a love affair  i didn't want to fall to such you know clich&eacute;s  i i wanted to write you know about one of my favourite poets that ever lived and his name is walt whitman  uhm hmm  and i was going through also a spiritual or emotional crisis with my belief system and my what i what i had faith or lost faith in  and i found him to be you know very comforting  and i found him to be one of the anchors that i anchored to in that time period  so i figured what better person what better topic  to write about  so in that sense taking what's already there and  and twisting it and letting it bloom and letting it go to different places this is what this album's all about  tell me about working with your brother joe  you guys work very closely together  he is your producer and matter of fact your brother ross is  working with you as well  but tell me tell me about your relationship with with joe and recording and   working in the studio   well this job is a little bit different because i moved to portland oregon and joe decided to stay in  los angeles   yeah   uhm hmm   so i took care of of most of the production on this album  and it was a little bit uh scary for me because i   i was used to being with joe  but it ended up being that joe worked a lot on the album anyway  so he he worked uh  he did a lot of the overdubs with me and uh  he was there when i did a couple of vocals  and and we mixed it together  so you know the only difference was i had to pay him up front that's all laugh
