 when she's on the prozac she's much more s  steady and she doesn't have some of the episodes that she does when she's not on it  what do you mean by episodes  you mean   she has episodes of like wanting to kill herself or to hurt herself  and she says she could be sitting in a lecture or sitting at a table with a group of people or whatever and have these images going through her head of how she can hurt herself  and images of herself hurting herself like cutting herself  she says particularly gouging out parts of her body  huh   and just different ways of killing herself  she says she just obsesses over the idea of suicide  has she ever   she can't get to sleep at night because that's all she can think about   has she ever self-mutilated or anything like that  so she's never gone that far  she could she's she has she has   cough   not with ah another object  like not with a knife or a razor blade or anything like that but she will purposely go anorexic and that's another way of self  for self-mutilation   hmm   and what does uhm words   has she has she ever been hospitalized  how long   no  she's had it since she was a kid too  like she was four or five  when she first started mh hmm   she used to have images  don't tell her any of this stuff  uhm she used to have uhm like she has some memories of like when she was five six having sh   convinced herself that she had planted bombs or mines in their garden and that if somebody stepped on it  like on purpose to kill people  and that she'd planted them and she couldn't get them out but she was going to kill  like it was going to kill  and she use to have fantasies about killing her parents in particular  hmm  or that somebody was trying to kill her  uhm that there was poison in her food  what's her   there are so many variations of uh mental illnesses and they they all have similar uhm  like uh feeling   they they all seem to follow the same    pattern or ya but have variations you know  path   same pattern   people experience it differently  but then again there's there are classic cases i think as well eh  ya  depression or  i think uh hers is pretty classic case of depression  though i'm surprised that it's taken so long for somebody to actually  she's seen a lot of psychologists and psychiatrists in her past but  no one's ever sort of diagnosed her  well i don't think they're very quick to to  diagnose childhood depression  i mean ah it's not a   i mean that that's a good thing in my mind in one sense because i mean she was kind of able   but you know what she never got the help that she needed either  ya but she was also able to kind of avoid all the labelling that was associated with it you know when she was growing up  but she was labelled as the trouble  troublesome child a lot of the time mhh   and sh that caused a lot of problems  and she was labelled as being ill but just not having and but that it was her fault   ya   is her brother the same  that it was she was causing it rather than having any kind of recognition that this was a sickness  it was like she was purposely causing other people problems and    pain   this was this was  the sickness that was self-inflicted or  hmm   ya   but it was totally self-inflicted and inflicted to hurt the people around her and that it was selfish and  self-oriented and things like that  mh hmm   mhh   so cos she was never kind of given any kind of validation about it  right  that maybe she actually did have something real  her brother never grew up in the same  because they're twins eh so there was nothing  no he was act actually   she i think a lot of a lot of   her problems have been out there uhm the family comparison  like her father's quite domineering and uhm s  like that extreme patriarchal figure  hmm  and her brother actually her twin brother is the golden boy  he could never do anything wrong in her father's eyes  and he's extremely successful  he's basically everything that maria says she's not  ya but she's succeeded herself in i mean every other way   ya  did uhm uh so are those relationships like those relationship dynamics still playing themselves out  like what's  ya a lot  really  a lot  so her her trips home aren't relaxing words   no she doesn't go and stay with her family   or just not with her parents  her father in particular causes her a lot of problems  hmm  she can't handle it   wow  or doesn't want to that much  so   edie do you want to go outside  i'm not gonna going to   do you want to let her out   edie out you go  go on outside   i have to have this last cookie   she's just gonna going to want to come in again in a second   has timmy gone out again since uh  no   no   won't let her  she tries  she's always three words   she complains  i'll give you that   words max

like   it's not bad  it's not great  mind you it hasn't really been all that hot yet t   cos it was last year around this time of year that i remember calling you and you guts were in the middle of it   and i was dying   ya  you said max wasn't even handling it well  was this on de roche  mh hmm de roche was terrible for the heat  did they ever move that garbage   they had no ventilation  did they move that garbage out from underneath the bedroom window or did it stay there all summer  all summer  it was repulsive   huh  had did you ever hear  it it was macy 's friends  it wasn't yours  who who was the one that was going on the exchange program  one was going to texas wasn't he and the other was going to uhm   word   hmm   the other two stayed here  okay  ron and jim stayed here the other one  went away  what was his name  todd   no i don't think  matt   oh i don't remember now  i don't remember but i don't think i ever really met him  but had he not also done an exchange program in europe at one point  no idea  no idea  were they who was it for my birthday  in february   hmm  who was it that came up for my birthday in february  who came out for your birthday  ya   there was someone here  macy brought someone  it was a friend and his girlfriend or something or two friends from  it was at christmastime uh and it was at  no and uh  macy 's place   was it christmas   at my place   oh was it at your  ya okay it was at your place  there was a she had a few friends stay ouch laugh a few friends staying   ya   there was mary sheila  karen sherry i think that's it  and then ron and jim both came for that time too  cough   who was the one karen was kind of fixated on  jim   ya  was he the younger of the two  they're the same age   ya   well   the summer's upon us and hopefully the maritimes will be  as welcoming as it's it has been known  to be in the past  mh hmm   it has been gosh i have high expectations now  well you shouldn't have too high expectations  but uhm if you are in halifax and you want to see something beautiful peggy's cove is certainly a place that is manageable from halifax and worth you're worth seeing it's worth it's worth paying to see peggy's cove   mh hmm   i'd love to see it  ya well   words your friends and make it down there  it's too bad you couldn't make it over to the island  prince edward island too because uhm prin   prince   p e i prince edward island   ya  because the confederation centre has some really neat theatre   all summer long  mhh   and i mean even just to see anne of green gables it's worth it  oh  ya  like we went one year   i've only been to the island three times  four times   really   nice production word too   and uh but i've always been impressed  the groom from the wedding i'm going to is from p e i  what part   just outside of charlottetown  or i think actually right in charlottetown  ya okay  the uhm  what time is it  uhm it's quarter to nine  it's gonna going to be late taking the dog out for a walk  i don't know are you planning on going  i don't word   are you interested in going for a walk with  edie bring that back   i don't know   bring me my shoe  oh my gosh laugh   come on   bring it here  bring it here  she's looking pretty happy with herself with  that shoe in her mouth  ya you give me that   words   well she wants to go out  is that it  well ya she has she hasn't gone out since this morning  and she knows that usually after we eat that's the time we go  right girl   so uhm  pretend like you're still eating  ya  edie lay down on the floor  lay down  the tea seat   ya   we're attached laugh which makes it  quite ah quite good for us  does amy know uhm like amy 's  not going to this wedding at all eh  laugh no she doesn't know any of them  she's not connected at all  she's no  these are friends from  no thanks  just black   uh she's these are friends not from university  they're from like where i home  where i live  caledon   bolton area actually  bolton   i'm from caledon they're from bolton  is is is the caledon you're from  the same funding is it the same funders as uhm   mh hmm  really  ya  do you know the funding people  i think so  oh really laugh   i think so  it's kept under wraps  like it's not really talked about that much who they are  isn't that something  thank you  so what is it that it be i mean i know you don't really know who they are but what is it that you think is kind of motivating them to make such substantial   the uh well ter terry   terry said that it was because the  the funders were interested in social  social issues and wanted more research sort of things to be done   unbiased research  mh hmm  but they were quite aware that that doesn't really happen within the government and that it would have to be from the outside  ya   well what was their connection with tim   like did they know him personally  i don't think so  i think they probably knew his work cos he did a lot of consult like like terry   a lot of like freelance consulting social policy work  hmm  and uhm so they're they they  fund the benington institute but they don't have any say in what's being researched or the direction it's going to take  and that's right in the contract is that they have no say in the work that's being done  so basically they would provide the core funding that provides for the rent the salaries and that's it  ya   mhh hmm  and then everything else is  holy  they must be putting in a substantial amount of money because  tim and terry don't come cheap  well but they also do get they get paid   for the people who ask them to do contracts  like they do contract work and other people contract them out like contract for them   so they get money in as well  like they are it's not totally  non   huh   well it's non-profit i suppose but it's like   it does reciprocate like   it's not entirely funded by this caledon   family   right
