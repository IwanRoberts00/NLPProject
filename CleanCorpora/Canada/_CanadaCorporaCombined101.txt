 the classic you know social type of thing  mhh hmm   and in this case it's your own hypothesis by yourself so you look for confirming information so   right  and you'll find it and then you go on and it maintains it  hmm  so there's so there's all kinds of  social co you know cognitive things that may be going on  and there could be motivational things  right  so it's not   either or  ya you're still at the accuracy versus motivation   ya at a very like  cos i'm afraid that if it is accurate then it can't be motivated  i i i see now that i got into this equation no accuracy equals motivation equals rationale you know which  isn't doesn't have to be that way  no  okay  no  it's uh it's simply in a sense  you're you're taking the uh the  you know the old-fashioned view   more old-fashioned views or   the old-fashioned view  and it's  here the way you have it set up starting with you know the klein and the loftis point is nice because you're saying well you know the   rational model so to speak doesn't hold  probably and there may be many things operating bum bum bum  bum   mhh   mhh hmm >  right   right it's more complex and   word suggest   that's it   dekunda 's in in psych  bull   psych bull i think psych review  but i think ps ps psych  i think it's psych bull   i think that'll help  so that cos you can tell i'm looking for that bridge right about there laugh you know and uh i don't want to create it artificially when there is a nice way to create it so  ya and you don't word   ya i think you can flow  just cover a range of issues including  motivational factors  right   mhh hmm  uhm   see i don't know if on page nine when you say this motivational component may involve a defensive reluctance to acknowledge self- confusion is that what it is or is it that  mhh   or to avoid   ya  is is it is it  you wanna want to   you you're   reluctant to acknowledge something or you just want  to   mhh hmm   right   to avoid it   mhh  or not confr confront   or just not   it's ki kind   well let's do let's put it his way  oh you want to maintain your stablity as opposed to  avoiding instability  it's different   avoid instability   it's a different assumption  vis-&agrave;-vis as opposed to   right  it's a maintenance model not a warding off model  right right right  right   and you know why this ends up sounding like this  defensive reluctance to acknowledge   why   because when we included experiment one  with the defensiveness measure  the only way you could work the defensiveness is to the reluctance to acknowledge your own  ya   ahh   oh i see  yes   okay  so laugh i see exactly where that's coming from  right   okay   so it's ah more of the maintenance to maintain their stable  word self   exactly   so it's kind of a different uhm feedback model so to speak   mhh hmm   and that's actually more in line of uhm with uh  what's his name sorrentino's arguments  his is totally pitted that way  it's the high-certainty person is the maintaining one and the low-certainty attaining one  they attain   ya   mhh nice nice   ya you see there you could do even there you could do a c f sorrentino  for example  right   that's that's fine   like when i say the the   motivational account like in terms of  maintaining at a low word people to attain i mean that is sort of his  that's right   so i could just c f him without being   that's that's a very reasonable thing to c f him there cos it's it it  says compare  yet laugh </o > compared to   sorentino and that's the parallel argument   it sounds horrible laugh   ya laugh ya   right and his discussion   exactly   oh so that's good  that's perfect  hmm   right   okay   well it seems redundant there  you've got defensive reluctance to acknowledge   mhh hmm   next sentence may not readily acknowledge   right  next sentence they may be quite motivated to avoid   laugh i say the same thing three times   i i i don't know   laugh i know what you mean  so one of those is going like that's all going a bit too far  i word   ya anyways so i i'm going for like uh two days  uh i'm going to hit washington for half a day as well i guess   to wall street  to wall street ya  so i'm seeing their salomon brothers' chief  income strategist uhh the head of fixed income trading at morgan stanley  mh hmm   uh huh  uhm he earns like sixty billion dollars in bonds or something like that  it's going to be quite a quite a  trip so   i'm going to do some econometric testing of their uh yield curve model  see if it really works i guess  uh huh   i guess morgan stanley has developed this stuff on var this value at risk a few words   ya okay   have you seen their their work there a few words   ya i get their risk metrics and stuff like that  so you get this thing regularly eh   ya ya   it comes out how often   it seems it seems  like it's just a garch generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity kinda kind of   or a lot of it  or they're big on garch  they try and sort of do garch for dummies  changing volatilities  ya   this is this is the next big thing  like every publication now has got stuff on v a  on value at risk   so it's   ya   because it's sort of the uh  the thesis topic to come  but now we've gotta got to worry about yours  exactly   so the story is uh   ya   where where are you at  you say you've done a little bit of uh estimation  you've done some of the de rosa   essentially   ya   exactly   ya i did i've done the de rosa  what i did though is i uhm uhm i'm  kind of keen on rolling regressions and and so   instead that way i only get a big in-sample or out-of-sample period estimated and it allows for the coefficients to  change   mh hmm   mh hmm   uhm and and so i've done it both ways anyways  but i did the rolling regression estimates of de rosa's  uhm and i compared them with the salomon brothers' uh values  now this is the the sort of the  what i need to know is stuff like uh how fancy a model are we going to use for hedging  just a simple hedge ratio  like if we say the durat  duration we know the duration of the futures contract   uhm are we just going to do a linear weighting so that we uh come up with our targeted duration or to neutralize duration  mh hmm  uhm stuff like that   and then ma what i'd like to know is sort of maybe we could agree on a frameworks for what's  all of the steps i could do and then it would constitute the  finished work  ya   well i think that the the the f   the way you got it organized is just to uh focus  and   and that's an important thing and if you're going to  get out of here is to look at it in the form of the number of steps right  right  exactly   you say that you've got the uhm introduction  sort of the you've got the  you've got the topic right  right  the basic topic is is uhm  developing a new better model for measuring duration right  so just like everything else right  sitting down and writing is is is   the the the the tough part but it's the part that you got to organize  mh hmm  so you introduce your topic one introduction right  just as uhm  mh hmm   did you write uh a proposal for  of any sort for   i i've actually i've written some stuff   did you write me a proposal when you did your   thing   uhm no i   i can't remember what i did off hand but i have written a few pages about you know just uh it's not really uh structured that well but it is a bit of a review and sort of a bit of what ifs and ands  ya   and i meant to bring it actually and i i  ran out the door this morning kinda kind of   fast   i see   i can probably fax it to you or email it to you   ya but you you could but i mean the the important thing is that  right we get get down to it right away  right  the the uh you can think of it as well i'm i'm writing my proposal which is  gonna going to be the the final product as well  word cos we're   we're skipping that stage cos right we're not uhm  right ya   cos i don't i   i mean there is a research grant competition for collecting data and for everything else and word you've got  that s that stuff   ya but i got all the data i need   so you just wanna want to get ah ah something that's that's quick  and uh proper and state of the art and publishable right  exactly   right  so you lay out your problem in the introduction   you got your literature review  mh hmm   right  and the literature review you try to make it a synthesis right  there isn't a lot out there and there's uh the de rosa that you can refer to and then there's the complicated ways of  doing working at it  exactly ya   ah there there aren't a lot of empirical duration models out there  right   there's that word paper  that that i'm working on that you  you've got there uhm with   with jay and   harry   mh hmm   word that  uhm i don't know if you've had a had a   chance to go go through that  ya  ya actually i'd word   there's also ah ah a d l j investment bank, donaldson, lufkin & jenrette uhm empirical duration that they use  empirical model   it it's pretty simple though actually  they uhm their hedge ratio is based simply on price changes relative to price changes in the ten-year treasury and then it's a percentage of the duration of the ten-year treasury  mh hmm  ya  it's simpler than the de rosa  uhm but it it's very easy to calculate  it might be worth throwing in you know as an extra  duration comparison again so we might have a word   do you get the journal of fixed income where you work  uhm we do but we don't  uh for some reason some of the issues have disappeared and that one you told me about actually has disappeared  i had to get a   the one with the the   paper by dublusky or or   d breeden's paper  uhh   was it d breeden or word   ya september or december ninety-five  december ninety-four   sorry  ya   i think   ya  that's ya the the one that you  you had emailed me  that   so you haven't gone through it yet  i haven't gone through that one no  hold on   kay okay/+> i've got it here   let's let's dig it out  so one of the things and  uhm what's clear from that paper is that right if you try to measure duration if i can find it it's not very stable   mh hmm   it's not stable and uh if you do it  look at it from ah a one factor model  right   and he he uses a very simple approach just saying well let's regress the percentage of the prices on the ginny mae's government national mortgage association  or on the fanny mae's federal national mortgage association   i mean the question is we gotta have got to   focus on when you said you did the estimation are looking at  ginny mae's or fanny mae's or what are you word   looking at   they're all fanny mae's  okay   i've got > coupons from six and a half to ten percent basically  the generic i suppose   uh huh   so he looks at it from a number of different perspectives  uhh across the empirical durations  exhibit twenty-five where's that  they're they're all very  unstable and uh what what one   of the things that he finds here is well throw in a ah if you throw in a two factor model right you get a better fit  mh hmm   mh hmm  and uhm actually there are a couple of papers   that that that i think you should look at uhm  besides that   and uh cough right he quotes a paper by waldman uhm  in the journal of fixed income
