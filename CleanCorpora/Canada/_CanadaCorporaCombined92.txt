manager he's a nice guy  he says you know laugh starts we haven't scored three goals since we played you guys laugh ends   oh really laugh   laugh   mm hmm   laugh   havin having a hard time  if the whole morale's down  well sigh the um i mean it's  just that they're like that day i mean i guess i was right because on that the end of that day i   i felt maybe like a better coach but in my opinion they'd used up a lot of luck of theirs for the season they  kind of used up all of our bad luck laugh for the year like   mm hmm   so it was kind of confirmed  laugh   we just we just ahh we outplayed  em them so  the only thing is just it's i don't know i guess guys are more cruel or whatever but also when they're younger like that kind of possession three or four years ago would've been a nine nothing game not a two nothing  but the thing is is that the goaltenders get a lot better  and hm the defen like people just defensively get more useful so we spent the whole time pl outplaying them but we beat them too you know so it's alright but  mm hmm   okay   can be handled can be handled  they're gonna going to start calling you guys the steamrollers or something  hmm ah we're pretty good pretty awesome  laugh   i dunno don't know good  good kids i'm i'm lucky i got good word kids to work with but  quiet mumble starts that's fun quiet mumble ends   mm hmm   but anyways not too much new there  i'm kinda kind of i don't know   they're it's a year older than i should be coaching   i'm  yeah well you mentioned that last time you're better with younger kids   yeah  well i'm kind of feeling the same way  but it's good i guess   yeah well it's still an experience i  mean   yeah it is and it's gonna going to be a good one it's probably the only time i'll ever  p ever coach a provincial championship side so     laugh   yes we are cocky um   laugh   aren't we awfully sure of ourselves  but i got into a little touch back with the age group i   wanna want to work with the

i think that   you have a really nice couch  laugh yeah   it's kinda kind of like  laugh   if that happens and there's a precedent then it's not so much  in the end of the evening that you even think that would bother him but it would be the kind of the follow up to that  mm hmm   laugh   and i knew that's what was gonna going to  be the thing  i knew it  uh so anyway there you go  that's fine   laugh   i mean i know i can survive  i'm sure you can  i got some stuff again too  anyways i kinda kind of i k  we kinda kind of chose the last little bit mumble starts three words stuff there it was kinda kind of funny mumble ends  yeah i think your dad and my dad will get along famously  ahh no yeah  i dunno don't know we'll see  you can see  you can reserve judgement on that call but  well i dunno don't know my dad tends to get along with everyone unless they're totally obtuse  yeah  yeah     well pronounced w your dad's cool i thought he was a pretty cool guy word he's got good taste anyway  and two words   laugh   well why because he likes you  of course  laugh   sarcastic mumble starts what a  two words sarcastic mumble ends   laugh   boy aren't we awfully sure  oh mom has uh passed judgment on you again  oh agai oh that's an every week thing isn't it  she says   oh no but this this one's good  she says that she really does like you now  oh good  i think she somewhat uh reconciled herself to the fact that she's just going to have to like you  oh laugh it's kind of a twist her arm thing  laugh   has she forgiven me for the uh recycled paper slash  ah false document two word   it's laugh   laugh   yeah well she sort of was i i  guess she spent about two weeks working on that one  yeah  and so this this week i was i was uh cleaning house and actually she comes up to me and goes well dina you know um you know i really like  stu but don't tell him i said so  and i went well pronounced w i don't think it will be a very bad thing if he knew that you liked him laugh   and she went well you have a point laugh   laugh oh well   so she word i'm i'm i'm  i'm so happy for that you have him and i'm sitting there going laugh starts well that's good laugh ends  where did this all come from   heh   i can r i think it's just cos my mother she sort of misses having another female in the house that she can you know talk to about silly things sometimes  ah ha  cos i mean you know with this she does have the twins and the twins don't talk to her very much at all
