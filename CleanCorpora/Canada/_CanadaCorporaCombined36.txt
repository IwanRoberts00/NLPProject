 the dip diploma   the dip diploma   ad adult dip  diploma   ad adult ad adult  ed education dip  diploma   ya  oh okay  so that it's through but you see i then want to take that degree as you know and not turn it into a diploma but be able to contribute that towards my pre-thesis   credits in a master's  cough   mhh   okay so you you want to if i understand correctly you want to take the the the  diploma and take all those credits  and and throw  them into the   ya   ya   ya along with the stats course and the research and design course  and you wanna want to throw them  i in phone rings   what  okay i guess you can answer it  excuse me though   i guess i can answer it ya  it could be home   just one moment  isn't it after hours   hello  yes  uhm actually i am  where are you  uh huh  it did  no we can we can split one  uhm i don't know where to get another cartridge though  uh uh trying to think  okay i'll just make a note of that  i'll have to get one tomorrow  uh alright i'm glad you called and called me  i'll get a i'll get a cartridge tomorrow  no problem  so they'll be another one there tomorrow night  mhh hmm  mhh hmm  ya  right  so you're going to leave it there  okay  alright so  no  alright uhm so maybe i'll speak to you later  i'm sorta sort of in the me  middle of something now  okay  talk to you later  bye one-sided telephone conversation   sorry about that  that's okay  ya so ya that's what i wanna  want to do  cough   oh well hmm i wonder how that's gonna going to  work becuase they the i know that there's sorta sort of a rule about double counting credits  no it's not it wouldn't be double counting  i don't want the diploma  oh you don't want the diploma   i just wanna want to  complete the credits that will allow me to get certification   ohh right  and there is a precedent from university of montreal  somebody who completed the requirments for the   dip diploma for teacher certification  within a master's degree  mhh hmm   it should be possible  i know it's just that you know first of all  gina 's not being helpful because she doesn't want me to go and graduate from another department  ya   she wants me to graduate from ad  adult dip diploma </}  mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm  and uh and a lot of people just don't understand it  it's just they you know   it's just it's all too complicated for them  mhh   i've got the number of the ombudsman and i'm thinking maybe if i speak to the ombudsman and try to get them to see  i mean i why should i have to do  another stack of credits to get around to doing my thesis  mhh hmm   i mean how many courses can i take  mhh hmm  they're not nuh virtually none  of them are helping me with what i'm with what my  field is except because i make them  mhh hmm mhh hmm  you know  mhh hmm ya well  and some of them i can't  well why don't you could call the ombudsperson you know   you think it's worth it  well marianne is very good  ya   marianne nelson you know her  mhh hmm   i would speak to her  okay  she's terrific  okay   she's very bright  ya i just need somebody who can   who knows their way around the  university   she   this is   i'm just i just feel like i'm i'm going in a circle and  every you know one person says yes the next person says no but i don't know how they all connect and how we can connect it up and and get you know get this cleared up  mhh hmm   she can she's brilliant at  this  ya   i mean i mean i don   don't   i mean there's no guarantee that she can  help but but if anybody knows   how the university functions  she knows better than anybody  marianne eh   i'm looking for my agenda   well no but   ya   okay   okay that's what i need  and somebody neutral you know where it they're not it they where they're you know they've got nothing at stake     oh ya that's that's  the beauty of of of the  ombuds office cos   because that person has no vested interest    in   ya   that's what i was thinking   oh that's good to know   exactly   marianne who  nelson   how do you spell it  n e l s o n  right   eight five eight two six five one   two six five one   two five two   five one is the secretary  okay  five two is marianne 's number  okay  ya  and she's terrific  well i worked in that office for three years you know  okay   really  well that   i was a part - time ombudsman  eww  ya and that's when i got to know her   does this seem like a reasonable thing to approach them with  sure  i mean you're in a i think  in a in a sense you're asking for another student request  ya in the end   you're asking   ya you you know in the final analysis you wanna want to present a case  ya i figure i've got almost the  i i probably have like with the thirty credits some of them won't count towards a master's degree  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   so they'll be just dead weight  mhh hmm  right  so they won't count so i'll lose i'll lose   maybe uh six easily six because it's practicum  mhh hmm mhh hmm ya  and then maybe a couple of other courses that won't count  mhh hmm   but then there's the research  so there's a few more courses and then i can do my   my thesis  because it's forty-five credits for a   a master's in education  mhh hmm   four f forty- f five   in in in ed education  studies  no in education not in  oh in education yes ed education  studies ya not ed educational tech  technology though   ya ya the ed education   studies is forty-five  ya  and there's three  there's ed education studies child study and ed educational  tech technology   mhh hmm   ya  i don don't   i don't know what child study is  ya but i can't i can't work into child study  no   i think that's unfeasible   at with my  background   ya   ya ya  you know you can't do do your diploma in adult ed education and then say well i want to do my master's in child studies can i use these laugh   i mean there's a lot of overlap in my field actually which is funny  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  but i don't think i can pull that off   no   i'll do my doctorate in child studies  conceptually it might be a bit confusing for someone  ya   but   hmm so you want to gradu  graduate you want to do to finish in ed educational tech  technology right  is that it  no i don't care about ed educational   tech technology at this point  i just want to get this i  wanna want to get to my thesis   no   ya  and y you know uhm   you're you're thinking that some of the courses i took there might not be acceptable in the   and that's also possible too  there might be more than i expect  well there ya there are you've taken   ed educational tech  technology courses that  well i don't know how many you've done altogether but some of them would for sure not be acceptable by ed education   studies  uh the one the one that i think would not be but it could be like a special topic would be interactive multimedia  ya hmm  but if that gets gone you know it it d   it doesn't really matter  it's just it's still gonna  going to be at least twenty credits that i can probably put towards forty-five in a master's thesis  mhh hmm   i don't wanna want to spend the rest of my life doing this  no you got you gotta have got to finish it because it it'll  it feels so good  ya   oh oh yes i was gonna going to   ask you yes  and   so when did you finish  the uhm well convocation was uh  when was it anyway  june early june  ya   early june  i don't remember the exact date  fifth or something like that   and it was amazing  just a good feeling that's really nice when the pain stops  just like  that   ya   yup   i can't i can't  do it anymore  i   i liked it  i mean i enjoyed what i did and i learned a lot   uhm but it's   i'm just having i'm  i'm having difficulty because there's been too many stumbling blocks  you know i started out and then ka-chunk and then ka-chunk and then ka-chunk and then   mhh hmm mhh   you know it's just i'm i'm  sure i'll get going again once this gets cleared  but i'd really like to try to clear this up this summer  mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm  because i need to have something in place  i i've been in this limbo for too long  mhh hmm mhh hmm   ya and and you at a at a   certain point you r you run   into trouble with your credits  you know if they're o too old   oh really eh  that's what they call stale dating   uh huh  so they'll say your credits are stale  well you know what am i supposed to do anymore  you know and that's par part  i didn't even know about that but i guess that's part of it too   you know after five years or something like that they start  getting kinda kind of antsy about your credits  they'll say well the program's changed and you can't use those credits anymore  even for your own program  ya ya  you know it becomes really   there's something to be said for suffering you know all at once  getting it over   ya i can't afford to do that option now  no no you can't   so it's a lot of things i'm not too uh y  i've got i've gotta got to   deal with them  and it's very overwhelming for me  ya   you know it's on every front  ya ya  but what can you do what can you do  hmm   how long is your mortgage  twenty years twenty-five   no i've i  gotta have got to renew it in august  ya  i've been getting the lowest possible   but i mean overall your amortization period   oh yes i think it's twenty-five years  sorry i see what you're saying now  ya   ya  ya  so you don't wanna want to til you're   ya no mortgages are twenty years  ya  ya you don't wanna want to wait for another twenty years before you go back to school   ya well   ya   ya so there's a there's a lot of factors  and uhm and it's really hard dealing with this new relationship when my factors are so heavy  mhh hmm mhh hmm   you know nothing is in place for me  i'm just trying to resolve a lot of issues now and it makes me very uh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   well it's hard when you wanna want to  accomplish things  when you're like that you know  you're sort of the opposite of a flake   you know you're you're you're you're a worker  ya  you know you justif justify  you're always justifying your existence in one way or another laugh you know  ya  i it you know in a   in a serious kind of way uhm  so you've got your master's in ed  educational tech technology now   oh ya as a matter of fact i think i have it right here  ahh well you haven't put it on your wall yet  i did i can even show it to you  look at that  wow  isn't that neat   ohh very nice  this makes me feel really good  you can teach a middle-aged dog new tricks you know  and you're looking at  ya it's a it's it's good   it's good because es especially  because it's especially gratifying because i did really well in the program and i was a hopeless student before  uh huh   you know when i was an undergraduate   cough   ya  my transcript is a total embarrasment  cough really  oh ya it's a total embarrasment  i think i have the worst transcript of anybody  i've ever word   cough   are you serious   ya well you should hear uh that joe guy out there in  psych psychology   he's like grade point average you know of a f  four three point nine five five five or whatever   ya   you know it's like oh be quiet  ya  you know i said don't you know the joy of flunking a course  you don't know how good it feels to just say this course  is full of it  ya   the heck with it  the political  flunk me see if i care laugh   i only did that in college and i could afford to lose a few credits because they've always got you filling  more than you need  ya   oh ya sure sure
