month  ya she told me   then i got a nicer house in the dominican village  and i was working for them  cos i was working as a uhm as a  manager for a restaurant  so i was buying the fruit and uh uh

spanish   ya   it's i don't practise it here though  but i i picked it up really qui  quick   i i'd been down there several times and i studied a bit of spanish  and uh but i did learn to speak the street spanish  cos when i got back i went to this uhm peruvian restaurant and i was ordering in in spanish and the guy is  laugh was looking at me  he was stunned  he was where do you come from laugh   laugh   that is like really bad slang spanish laugh and you don't learn that in school laugh   laugh   with the swear words laugh and everything  a real hillbilly laugh   laugh   spanish style laugh   i loved it  i was black  i was so tanned  i was like a real beach bum laugh   laugh   it was kinda kind of interesting  and down there like really really bad things happen  to people  we we called it nature  uhm we we just thought it was uh nature's brutality but cough   it it was funny  we'd we'd buy these little leather uh bracelets these these little leather bracelets  and we sai said  laugh me and a friend of mine said we were gonna   going to buy one for each disaster laugh you know we encountered   laugh   each really really nasty thing that happened to us and fucked up laugh our lives  so we bought one i bought one when the house burned down  i bought one when the i  broke my hip   you broke your leg   and uh and we said we were gonna going to  go home when we had them up to the elbow laugh   laugh   of course we didn't wait that long  we thought it was all kinda kind of  funny laugh   and he came back the same way  a horseback riding accident  and he he was very very reckless   he was racing with his girlfirend  this this rambo - type german chick  and uh laugh and he  screwed up  got a punctured rib broken hip laugh   and you don't want to get needles there  laugh   you don't want to get shots   right   you don't want to be very ill in a third world country   it's just cough something you you  try to avoid if you can  get on a plane  ya  ya laugh   laugh   oh well  i was in jamaica when i was five  my uh my dad grew up there  do you remember any of them  three words mumbled  ya  ya  i used to have uhm   you know an old old friend that he'd been to school with was still there   so i went to stay at his place for a little while  his farm  and then we went to this we rented this  uh cottage on the beach  uh huh  and apparently it's now a huge huge tourist development  okay  but this is in nineteen seventy  it wasn't  it was just you know like local jamaicans had houses there and there was like an old hotel you know from the thirties  down the beach anyways  and there was a coral reef off and and and   stuff  but uhm my major memory is is one day i was walked in the bathroom watching my dad shave and he had the old ra razors you know he had safety razors that were all wrapped up in paper or whatever  and i guess he was watching watching   my eyes and decided you know no no no don't you know  like de really you know told me really  forcefully that i was never to touch these  okay  and uhm he probably put the idea into my head  laugh   ya right laugh laugh   so that day i was at uh i'd come back from the beach or something and i was ja anyways and i went into the bathroom and i'm not " i" start taking these things out and playing with them  laugh and next thing i know  i mean i'm naked too at this point  laugh   next thing i know and there's a there's a  you know a cook or a maid and i'm crying and there's blood all down my hands and she's runnning from the hut where we were to the  the ki kitchen hut that had like a  a breezeway through it  and she's rushing along there and my fingers are all bleeding   hauling me in hauling me into the kitchen  i mean i'm all embarrased laugh cos i don't have any pants on laugh   it's like i feel really upset   laugh   but uh laugh that's my big   one of my big memories of jamaica  laugh   huh  but ya   what was your dad doing there  in jamaica  ya  his father was running a sugar plantation   uhm for tate and lyle  eww okay   and so he went there when he was twelve  and and then uhm mostly he   i mean he was in a boarding school till he was sixteen  and when he was sixteen h he   came out of the boarding school left the boarding school or whatever  uh worked on the sugar plantation for two years and then at eighteen he joined the navy  hmm  and that was the end of jamaica  wow tough life  ya his dad drove him to the drove him to drove him to kingston   put him on the ship   drove back home and died  had a stro stroke  laugh heart failure and died laugh   laugh   so uh he was a weird man ah ah my dad  huh   my dad had a was a really you know had a whole trouble had trouble with the whole fathership thing  uh huh  just cos i mean he grew up with a he grew up in thailand with a thai nanny until he was six  mhh hmm  speaking thai you know   mhh hmm   at six he got sent to england to go to school  his parents were there until he was like ten  mhh hmm  from six to ten he were no remember he well claims to remember very little   uhm going to this school  living with grandparents that that  didn't really want to know   and then then there was a revolution in  in siam  uhm when siam bacame thailand laugh   mhh hmm   and uh so much for and so that was the end of his dad's job and uh and  pension laugh   so he came back to england and and they lived in england till he was twelve   and he was a ah when he was twelve   he just he just won a place to a  no it must have been just earlier than that  cos he just won a place to like canterbury cathedral choir school  he loved to sing  uh huh  and they hauled him out  took him off to jamaica  we got a job in jamaica  bye laugh   and uh and then they and then they  planted him in a boarding school  and so he really had no idea who his parents were  who his dad was  he learned who his mother was later   hmm   but he had no idea who his father was or what fathers do   uhm and uh his mother had a twin brother who was in england which who uh later drank himself to death  and uh the only alcoholic in uh in  my dad's family that i know of  and uh and he may well have been i would just   finally realized just recently that that   this guy was probably the surrogate father  at least for the time that my dad was in england  mhh hmm   my dad loved him  he said he was a really really great man  you know really nice and everything  funny   all of my all of my dad's mother's family are all hilarious  mhh kay  ya it's wild to tell stories  i don't know or were anyways and uh  my dad once told me this story  i don't know much about it  he doesn't talk much about yugoslavia but he was raised by his sister that looked a lot like me that died when i was a kid  mhh   i don't know what that's about but  i i noticed something weird the other day  i i'd seen it before but uh since we hadn't seen each other in so many years i guess i forgot it  uhm he he never talks much about that period of his life but he does di discuss  it with people he doesn't know  and he's always very proud of saying he's slavic  and there's this little shop around my place where they sell computers and and crap and he wants to buy me a printer  uh there's a printer going for eighty bucks  and we go  and the guys the two guys who have the shop are russian  so they start talking russian  speaking in russian  and uh and he's really boasting about how he's from yugoslavia and how he's so proud of me uh i don't know and this whole thing  so now the two guys really like me laugh and all of that  but i find that so bizarre in a way  and i when i was younger i was very uhm insecure and i guess i used that a lot to define me  you know that i was from far off place laugh and things like that  i find it goofy that he still uses that in a way  sure it's i don't know it's like this whole pattern of interaction   ya  and uh i mean the whole network  there's the the whole there's a whole a whole country network for most immigrant communities  right long phrase   mhh hmm  and even like my parents are just your standard   eng english > you know brits  </} and and you know i'm sure  <mhh hmm   well they don't do it to get good deals laugh    okay laugh   cos that's not allowed  you're sup supposed   ah no you're supposed to pay the bill without looking at it  ahh
