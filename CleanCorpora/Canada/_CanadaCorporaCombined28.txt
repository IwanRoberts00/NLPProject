 that's a really big and gawky one though i think we should try to sell that one  yeah that's true   yeah  true  but this is this is a neater one  two words glass   come on  come on out  yeah   yeah  words i remember word the red speaker far away from mic laugh   word they painted it that colour two or three words   hey did you give maeve that  uhm  i don't know  i may have  i think you did give her one once   yeah it's entirely possible i did   uhm  she had another one  uh i think you did give her that one  mm  uh so you might as well keep it as a spare  mm   it's a nice one  this also makes me think that you did give it to her  yeah  no yeah   it's uh nice soft leather  yeah  yeah um probably   okay these you also gave to her didn't you these little glass things  i yeah i   was it those or these or what  no  ah she had these  these were little dessert things but these are the stuff  these are the these are the  dishes   yeah ya yeah   yeah those   yeah well i see there's two different ones actually  these are two different things   no i recall  but but these are the ones she always wanted for stuff in the fridge  remember  well yeah there're things like this  they were there were the little pa  they were the little pyrex bowls  so so do you want them in fact   but we have little pyrex bowls you know  but they can be used for uhm uh cr&egrave;me caramel   oh  i'm sure you make it every night  yes  laugh   yeah  okay do you want this for a phone  uhm  no i think it would just be uh effectively it would just clutter things up  just clutter laugh   yeah   laugh just clutter things clutter things up  laugh   yes three or four words   okay so i can probably sell this  what's this   yes mm hmm  or maybe i'll keep it myself  yeah well if you wish you can  uh well what is this   okay so   that  what these are and i dunno don't know  why they're so squashed maybe we could start anew  these are the candlestick things off the lamp   oh   now when i had i had that lamp repaired  mm mm  and one of these was missing when it came back and the guy gave me this to make another one up  i dunno don't know what that is   i dunno don't know how these got squashed  they can probably probably be ironed out  mm hmm mm   uh and i've got uhm  wall wallpaper   i was al always for  maeve i was always going to put some of the wallpaper on like up in the hallway cos i thought it would look quite attractive  so if you want that   yeah but see the difficulty with that  is that anything like this uh which is papered it gets too hot  will burn  well it's totally away from the light  mm word   it was on them mart   it it   yeah yap   no no i know  word   it had it had that  cream coating   many two words   yeah exactly  no  so you might want to i dunno don't know you might have to start over again  okay   yeah  this little elastic band you can probably use  yes  we always end up not having enough elastic bands  uhm  okay  okay e   this iron  mm hmm  you don't need an iron  no we don't need an iron but i could use   the uh the the   word   well we might as well keep it   the stand  the stand  oh really  yeah  you don't have one   yeah   no we don't have a stand  okay we'll put this with the kids'   no   it's a heavy iron as well   well this is it  i know   but but  nonetheless uhm   i know this kind of iron myself intimately  i even learned how to sh   shirts do my shirts at the age of seven or something  laugh   ohhhhh age of seven   mm no i no this no i had   one like this and i sold it off as a uhm  yeah okay   you know   well we'll put it over there   so no i think it can go no i think it can go out   oh really  yeah i think it can go  oh uhm   patented nineteen fifty-one  ha  i should i clean this up  e cos that can be cleaned up can't it  mmm i wouldn't use anything on it   no  no  do you think it's   feel it   it's quite smooth  eeeeh it looks funny though doesn't it  no one or two words   okay how much  i th it's in good shape  yeah i know  uhm  well we irons i think are around about thirty dollars now  so probably   well yeah but they've gotten hi-techy  no i know  four dollars   no   what were you thinking  i i dunno  don't know   i thought you'd want to keep it for the kids  no no  i mean consider  irons in fact are a lot more than thirty dollars now  irons are one thing that for some reason have gotten a lot more expensive   hmm   it may be because you have one or two words  they're not my thing  uh so they're not that cheap to buy   hmm  yeah but the next uh half dozen years minimum   probably next ten years it would just be sitting around doing nothing except rusting   h   yeah that's true true true true true   ah right  okay so what we're selling this   yeah  no uh when i came uh came down  here uhm i got one   i got one given to me   hah and uhm clears throat yes  mm  okay   do you want this laugh   no no   laugh   i doubt that i can get rid of it  it bring doesn't say 'brings' back no memories to me  no  no me neither  i i don't think i can get rid of this actually  no  you could give it away  yes long, slow 'eee' uhm   there might be someone out there who would be willing to take it   do you need do you have to put   your kettle at work on anything  no no word   it can be used just as a hot thing  you know a hot   yeah i know uh what we're using right now is a retrieved copy of uh instructions for instruction manuals for the lotus one two three version one   well you could use this  yeah but we're using something else which is highly acceptable  okay  here's a couple of underwear shirts  do the kids wear underwear shirts ever  no  no i didn't think so  no  no  no  okay uhm i'll put that with the clothes  there's a bunch of clothes a which are upstairs  mm  i decided i would try to sell uh a lot of the clothes   rather than just shipping them off to the salvation army  mm yeah   no reason why not   mm mm   i went down to neighbourhood services to see what they   charge   mm did i tell you that uh jan tolstoy  uhm john smith's wife ex-wife and uh beatrice lindstrom both gave a donation to the uh salvation army  oh did they  yeah there was a uhm letter came through from uh salvation army saying that they one or two words   so i phoned them up and uh thanked them very much  oh how nice   oh  and you know   yeah a friend of mine didn't know that we had s you know say the salvation army and gave ah a contribution to the cancer society  oh  yes  oh  and i'm still getting letters  i got four letters this week  oh  laugh yes laugh   it's amazing laugh   yeah well   laugh   yeah it's in fact i had uhm sent out the information about uh you know the service and stuff  yeah   i think i sent it to anthea ledonne a little bit late and i thought well i don't think she can go herself  yeah  so i considered and i thought well i will send it also to  alwoods   mm hmm  and i'll say r you know i i   didn't want to look like i was trying to drum up business kind of so i sent it to them and said you know i thought that perhaps you would like to uhm  uh b i said i i don't think  anthea ledonne can get around on her own and i thought therefore that perhaps you would like to take her  mm hmm  i had a call monday or tuesday night from anthea   now that was the first time that i'd heard from her  you know cos i had written her twice  mm hmm   mm hmm   first of all when maeve was still  in the hospital and then immediately after she died  mm hmm   mm hmm  she's sounding fantastic  she was eighty-seven on just around the time  she was eighty-seven just around the time maeve died  mm hmm  she sounds great  she says she is fine  you know she sounded the same as ever really but th she has problems  walking and can make it out from her front door to a cab  yeah mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  but then she said bryn takes her around places  anyway i think although she didn't say it that dave alwood had gone over to see her  alwoods would you believe are moving to clearwater b c to a twenty-acre farm or something  ah yes  and  huffs and they're going to b   become farmers at age what seventy-five   intake of breath uhm  so then i had a i had   as you sow so shall ye reap  anyway yeah   i had ah a nice little note from chandra  oh indeed  yes this week   a charming note   pardon  a charming note  a charming note  her name is actually chandreya   yes   chandreya not chandraya   yeah i know   yeah i know maeve always uh  maeve always called her chandrey and  uh   word   no she called her chandra   well she called her chandra but you know when she called her   something formalized her name was   i think i think  word called her chandra   anyway  anyway uhm they she uh she  mentioned that they were going and so forth and that they had given my letter to blockmans   oh  now blockmans are the people who bought the house  yeah  and blockmans apparently will go  oh  so ah presumably they'll take anthea  because they know anthea you know  they used to live next door to anthea   ya   so laugh   oh did they live nor next door   next door yeah  immediately to the uh  to the north   or to the south  yeah   yes yes yes immediately to the north   okay in uh what's her name's place  kalynchuk's   no  the other side  yeah ya   you see so they've known anthea for  many many years  ya   oh  so anthea may go and i guess blockmans will be there  well you see she did write to maeve for a  few years and then maeve stopped writing cos she thought well  nat probably didn't want to  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   so   and i finally   and well this is one of the reasons why i   think there should be some sort of an announcement  a few words   finally   well i i think i think  we've uncovered everyone except for perhaps lords   really  mm   finally i heard from candy and rosalyn   mm hmm  uh they didn't say they'd be away  but then uh kind of odd cos she said oh let us know about uh what arrangements you've made for edmonton  mm   so maybe they're thinking of coming   they may uh okay   yeah  uh don't five or six words   uh yes okay these n  these are uhm clears throat the uhm  greek ones aren't they  okay   aren't these the ones you got in greece for maeve  th they're wool uhm   they're wool covers for cushions  mm   mmmmmm   yeah i may have gotten something uhm   what i recall getting   yes yes these are the ones word  i recall getting a a poof  footstool   yes yes you got the poof  but these i'm sure you got these uh in greece  mm hmm   mm hmm  uh i was thinking that they would be quite attractive downstairs in your basement  yeah stuffed on the wall  well drawn out 'weee' sound you could put them on the wall or make cushions out of them  true true   they would go with the uh sofa   mm hmm  so  with the futon  would you like them
