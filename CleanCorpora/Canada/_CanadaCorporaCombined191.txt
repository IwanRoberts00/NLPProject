 kathy floyd you'll hear just whispering  she has a a very bad cold  and it and it might come down to one of those fine calls when a third has to be yelling her lungs out   i think kathy's trying to save it for that moment   now here's the rock inside the centre line and we'll see if it moves   it's starting to come off the line now  it's curling pretty good   it curled too much   that's very much a surprise because it wasn't moving  there like that during the week   i'm really a little bit surprised colleen that julie sutton played a hit on that back one  you know she has last rock the corner guards are up   maybe throw one in around the guard as opposed to hitting on one that's just biting the back of the twelve foot  very good point don but uh julie to true to form has applied what i call the kiss strategy all week and that's keep it simple sweetheart and and it has worked for her  so she perhaps doesn't want to abandon yet what has worked so well for her  the other thing is that julie hasn't thrown that many draws either so perhaps she doesn't quite have the confidence in draw weight yet   not only lots of room but lots of weight  will it come to rest before it slides through  it bumps that stone at the back  new brunswick lies two   see this is a sh thought uh shot  i thought julie sutton would play uh with jodie's last rock  on playing the come-around corner guard   laugh good point julie a bit of backing  there's a fence   this is a classic curling delivery in my opinion   good extension   look how she gets right in behind the rock  maybe uh her wrist is a little bit high which i don't like but  she's right in behind the rock all the time   beautiful curling delivery  she sure doesn't miss much   no line is right  she's a way over on the outside of that centre line   okay for heidi hanlon of course don  the problem is that she comes down here she has to make sure that she hits it either very full or a little bit to the inside and drive it out this way  if she ever hits it three quarters and drives it over here  there's a chance that uh b c may have a chance for two   this looks like a fairly simple shot but it's really not   heidi has a great opportunity here to put some real pressure on british columbia if she can roll behind and sit three  and that's what she trying  this a b   starting to make a move   oi she's got a good looking shot and it's all in her weight  look at this  oh what a beautiful curling shot   just absolutely letter perfect  and now julie sutton is faced with the prospect of drawing the four play with her final stone to score a point  i'm not sure if you can hear poor kathy floyd calling those shots because she's just getting it out  well a great call by kathy floyd  it makes a little bit of a move at the end but look where her shooter rolls to  she makes great contact drives the b c rock out and she rolls perfectly behind the guard biting the four foot   advantage for julie is that she's throwing the same shot she just threw  exactly   okay now soon as she lets it go the brushes will get in there   and make and determine how fast it's going and she's got a lot of weight  she thinks when she released it that she had more weight than with her previous stone   i don't think she's gonna going to  stop in the four foot  is she going to slide through that hole  look at that  no i don't think so  it's coming over just enough to make contact  no just stops the back  but it's a steal of one for new brunswick on end four  so after relinquishing a point on end number one new brunswick comes back with single points on ends three and four  and the score after four ends is new brunswick two british columbia one in the scott tournament of hearts tv advertisments   you're watching sports weekend's live coverage of the scott tournament of hearts from saskatchewan place in saskatoon  new brunswick leading british columbia two one in this championship game as we play the fifth end   no stones in play as new brunswick second sherri stewart  delivers her first stone of this fifth end   all the curlers this week recognize the importance of winning this championship  it's being called kind of the three-in-one championship because  if you win this scott you go on to the world championship in winnipeg and then if you finish in the top six you go on to the olympic games and then of course you get to go back as team canada next year at the scott tournament of hearts in halifax  so it's a huge year for the winner of this one  a major prize or series of prizes awaiting the winner   and i suppose they have all throughout the week attempted to  put those thoughts in the background   well the olympic   but they can't help but be reminded  that's right and the olympic dream was one of the   the reasons why uhm heather houston decided to give it another go this year  she's such a great competitor and uhm she's always there in the end   this is a good shot   an excellent excellent curling shot   melissa put that one directly behind the guard in front of the tee-line  and the interesting thing here for b c don is that they're used to playing the straight takeout game because they normally have control of the game  they're now down one point and gonna going to  have to do a bit of gambling so it's gonna going to be interesting to see how they perform with their shot making  what sherri wants to do here too is to make sure she  misses the professional way  she just doesn't wanna want to go by it all  she either has to get the guard or get that red rock  well that's got   oh she made a good shot  boy let me tell you they're uh they're   playing a very very strong game and you heard heidi yell alright  and i guess that's just s super curling by sherri stewart   and ellen brennan the fifth player for new brunswick just yelled out that that was a six pointer referring to the statistics that curlers are scored every shot is worth four points when they're taking uh  stats but when a sh shot is super you should score five or six  at least according to ellen that was a sixer   we can excuse her for being somewhat prejudiced if she's a little overzealous in her scoring on the shot by  sherri stewart  laugh   and not a bad shot there by melissa soligo  well th the good part about it for melissa is the fact that she hit the word on so now the opportunity presents itself if new brunswick happens to hit and roll out  they'll be able to duck one around that guard again and that's the importance  of hitting and staying in that spot   aw maybe a little bit of a miscall on the sweeping by heidi hanlon there because she was yelling to sweep and they hit it a little bit too thin and rolled into the open   communication between skip and third   is it gonna going to fall out a bit  and julie said it might   which means you cannot afford to throw this rock outside the broom  which obviously jodie has a bit   now the advantage belongs to the new brunswick tweem  team because now they can pull one in around that corner guard   draw weight's been fairly consistent all week except for a couple of games but it's been running about twenty-four and a half seconds which is very very slick   so that's the amount of time it takes for the ice to travel from the hog-line to stop   the rock you mean colleen  that's right and i was just timing that one and it came in at twenty-four point seven to the button  and that's pretty good  that's pretty close  very fast   colleen that that rock has to be removed if anybody's gonna going to score  especially b c  the opportunity for jodie sutton is to play quiet  takeout weight and maybe get a little bit of an inside roll   no move at the end   if anything she rolled just slightly more into the open  now that was the weight that julie sutton wanted jodie to throw on her first rock  she threw a little bit too much weight and it floated out and that's why she rolled off   the nice thing about it for heidi hanlon is that jodie showed her the way down the ice   fairly wide open   a little bit of an inside road roll  for heidi hanlon could prove troublesome for uh julie sutton   i heard her say not much of a handle   it hasn't much m rotation on it  that means at the end it'll really cut   and that rock rolls into the open in the eight foot   one thing i noticed about julie sutton during the week and now in this game here she is very versatile in throwing the in-turn takeout or the out-turn takeout depending on where the ice is  it doesn't make any difference to her   she'd like to take advantage of that long guard   hoping for an inside roll   she has last rock advantage on this fifth end   she's going to roll too far   and now heidi hanlon i'm sure will try and take advantage of that guard  oh no question about it   i mean that was the uh the danger of rolling out and leaving that the opportunity to roll it by that guard or to draw it by that guard  see now that's confidence  she mise might as well take it right to the four foot  she knows she's gonna going to be in the house somewhere  just a question of where the brushers can put it   good strong bushing brushing will bring that rock into the four foot  that's what she's saying   let it go   if she's obviously heavy they won't touch it and they haven't   i think you're right heidi   well by  they never laid a brush to it all the way down the ice and where is it gonna going to stop   it comes to rest at the back of the twelve  new brunswick lies one  well the good part about it for uh heidi hanlon don is that it's behind the guard  it's in the back of the twelve foot  it's gonna going to force b c to take one   and that was their mission too   make british columbia take a point  anytime your opponent has last draw and you force them to take one you've done your job   laugh   laugh   in other words kathy you do the work  laugh   but it's an interesting commentary there from heidi thinking that she has one rock that perhaps is curling a little more and she referred to heather  heather throwed those rocks last night heather houston  and in a couple of instances heathers' seemed to curl quite a bit   well that's a hard thing to determine because it depends how you release them   i mean if she rolls it just a bit it's gonna  going to curl a lot more and if you put it out to the broom  it's gonna going to stay straight  it's nice draw weight by julie sutton   right to the button with the final stone of the fifth end for julie stutton and with that draw by sutton this game is now tied at  two speaker error he says stutton instead of sutton   so at the mid-point of this women's championship at the scott tournament of hearts it's tied at two sports wrap-up   at saskatchewan place in saskatoon after five ends this championship game is tied new brunswick two british columbia two  now let's join colleen jones
