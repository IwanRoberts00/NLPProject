 good afternoon  here's the c b c four thirty news  the owners of the quebec nordiques the nordiques are a professional hockey team say he province hasn't offered the kind of help needed to keep the team in quebec city  president daniel marchand says the owners unanimously decided the team has to be sold  ron smith reports  the nordiques may never play again in quebec city  the team faces elimination in new york city in game six of its playoff round against the rangers and team owners say they've decided the climate just isn't right to keep the team in quebec city  speech in french   today in the national assembly premier parizeau tabled the offer his government made to keep the team  the province is willing to cover up to twenty-one million dollars in team losses over the next three years  in the meantime quebec would study whether the team really needs a new twenty-thousand seat coliseum  team owner daniel marchand says that's not enough  marchand wants the new hockey rink built right away  and in that arena he wants a government-run casino that would dedicate its earnings to support the team  that way he says the nordiques would be able to guarantee they'll stay in quebec city  and he says the owners have voted unanimously to go if they don't get what they want  the nordiques could be knocked out of the play-offs tonight but the negotiations with the government are likely to go into overtime  the team president has asked to meet the premier to make one last plea for government money for the team  ron smith c b c canadian broadcasting corp. news  quebec city  now the owner of les nordiques daniel marchand is in new york  but leona davis has spoken to a team representative  she is on the line with us  leona   yes hi bill uhm  i spoke with john letourneau who's a spokesman for the team here in quebec city  uhm hmm  and he wouldn't say that it was game over as far as negotiations but he really talks as though in terms of   the very slimmest opening  and it all hinges on that meeting between daniel marchand  the president of the nordiques and jacques parizeau where they would discuss this question of the casino  now jacques parizeau has said no in two ways  he has said first of all that the the  matter of the casino is not his alone to decide but it's a government decision  and he's also said that he has mandated joel tessier uhm to be a negotiator in this affair and so he sees no need to meet directly with marchand on this sort of question  so this looks very much as though things are going down the  train drain on that  and letourneau says that this offer from the government was clearly insufficient  he reiterated their three demands which is the new arena uhm secondly uh help in covering the uh interim financing for the team while there is construction of that new arena  there its deficit could be ten or twelve million over the next two years and he says that would sink the team  if it if it isn't covered  they would go bankrupt  and then also the question of long-term financing through something like the casino  and letourneau says they have gathered seventy-five thousand signatures on a petition that they'll be handed in to the national assembly tomorrow and he says that's proof enough that those'd be the kind of people who'd be paying money at the casino to help support the nordiques and so the government should be uh getting behind that sort of will  so we wait and see then leona   thank you very much  you're welcome  the mont word regional health board has announced its own set of cuts for the next three years  they're chopping their budget by about five million dollars  shifting money away from hospitals towards ambulatory care  melissa pettifer has more  the cuts to the health care budget for the area south of montreal are not as serious as the ones on the island  with a population of one point three million people the mont  word works with a budget of just under a billion dollars  now they need to cut a net amount of five million dollars  investing in the prevention and promotion of health is their main goal and like montreal they're veering towards ambulatory care by investing fifteen million in outpatient care  that's the upside  the downside is the board will close two hundred acute care beds  and one hundred people will lose their jobs over the next three years  henri gagnon is director general of the board  he says in deciding who gets what money their goal was to establish no quality of services throughout the system and to reward efficiency  we can say who has uh work to do to uh to obtain the objectives that we have set  we will want to uhm uh make sure that the good managers uh come out the winners in this kind of an approach  the health board will work with a variety of partners including c l s cs centre local de services communautaires  school boards and other ministries to implement the cuts  melissa pettifer c b c news longueuil  quebec's health minister jean rochon says the equivalent of two thousand more hospital beds will be available for elderly patients needing long-term care  half the spaces will be created by transforming existing facilities  the other half will require new construction by nineteen ninety-seven  rochon says this plan should help people understand his aim is not simply to shut down hospitals  the real exercise which is going to be on is that we are redeploying redeveloping part of our system to to  make a modern system out of it  we have a very good system  but if we leave it as it is and go like that over the next five years we will have an a downgraded system because we will not spend the money in the kind of services that are most needed for by the population   canada at five  good afternoon  i'm linda clark   the president of the quebec nordiques say the owners have decided that the team has to be sold  daniel marchand says the quebec government has not made an offer that is good enough to keep the n h l national hockey league  team in quebec city  the province had said it was willing to cover up to twenty-one million dollars in team losses for the next three years  in the meantime it would study whether the team needs a new twenty thousand seat arena  but marchand says that isn't enough  the nordiques want the new arena built right away and the owners want a casino included in the building with all the profits going to the team  marchand has asked to meet with premier parizeau in a final bid to come up to come to a deal to keep the team in quebec city  the conservative majority in the senate says the chr&eacute;tien government is moving in the right direction but the tories are being coy about whether they'll end their opposition to bill c twenty-two  that's the legislation that will kill the agreement to privatize pearson airport  the tory senators have been stonewalling the bill because they say it restricts the airport developers from suing for damages  in a bid to break the stalemate the government has agreed to certain changes in the legislation  but even with the proposed amendments the conservative leader in the senate says the bill still denies the developers rights enjoyed by convicted criminals  adam carter reports  justice minister alan rock went before a senate committee today in an effort to persuade his tory critics that the government acknowledges that the pearson bill has its flaws and is trying to improve it  people can't get the code after june thirtieth  here's a change that'll allow them to do so  people can't recover expenses incurred after june thirtieth  here's a change that'll allow them to do so  you think there should be actions for defamation  help yourself  those are the changes  but rock stood firm on the government's policy not to compensate the developers for lobbying fees or for lost profits because the pearson contract is not going ahead  this is a horrendous piece of legislation  john lynch staunton is the tory leader in the senate  he says even with rock's proposed changes the bill is still discriminatory and punitive  in canada we allow serial murderers we allow convicted rapists we allow repeat offenders we allow petty thieves the full protection of the court system and the full protection of the law  and in this unprecedented piece of legislation full access to the courts is still being denied them under these amendments  outside the committee though lynch staunton admitted that with the proposed amendments the government is moving to satisfy some of the legal and constitutional objections to the pearson bill  but he says the tories will wait until they have heard from legal experts before they decide whether to end their ten month long campaign against the legislation and finally allow it to pass  adam carter c b c news ottawa  the head of the c r t c canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission says he has an idea that would help canadians better understand each other  keith spicer wants c b c television to add subtitles to its french news outside quebec and its english news inside the province so that in quebec you could watch the french news with no distraction  it would be only french  but if you wanted the english news you could see it with a french translation  and vice versa any kind of i think uh   that suggestion could do more for uh intercultural understanding than anything i can think of  right on target and uh uh i think we have to give mister beatty a few weeks to uh catch his breath but i can assure you we'll come back on that with him and uh uh see if he will respond to that  spicer was appearing before the heritage committee on parliament hill  ford of canada plans to spend five hundred
