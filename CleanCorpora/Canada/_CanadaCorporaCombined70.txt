 well she lives down in wychwood  she lives in aylmer  oh   and they settled there  paul or you know the husband is boring and bald and   wealthy and boring laugh   laugh   and bald laugh   laugh ya ya and he's had two different companies  well that's quite funny   but she she just she amazes me because she said to me i was explaining to her that i was  going coming here to have a conversation for an hour and she said laugh what are you nuts with violet  ya   she said i'll take violet and i was like god i wish i called you  ya   ya  so   wow   hmm that's funny   no i think things are actually plugging along in a very interesting way  i think it'll all end up being  and i've got an appointment to go and see my doctor on wednesday at eleven thirty  ya   ya   i've just gotta got to   get a vehicle so i can get out there cos he's way out   where is he   oh he's in barrhaven practically   what is that barrhaven  it's like woodroffe and baseline and far away   that barrhaven   well no but you know it's in that  it's towards orleans  no no it's it's west  all my life i've heard about barr  barrhaven and i  oh it's gross  no it's uh it's you you   cross baseline or knoxdale road and it's it's   like way out there  ohh   and uh he's been my doctor for twenty years and i just sort of  oh your medical doctor  ya  ohh   because i'm not perpetually ill or a hypochondriac then once a year traipsing out there hasn't been a real issue  uhm but it is in a way laugh cos it's just too damn far  it's nice to have a confident doctor  so   well ya  and so i'm gonna going to go  and and talk to him about uhm i don't know whatever prozac or whatever this they want to give me  any kind of la-la pills maybe two words   do you get a note from tom for that or  i don't think so  or does he call him or  well i'm i don't know  i'm gonna going to ya i'm gonna going to give him tom 's number and say you know you can confer with him if you want uhm but this is the scoop and i'd i think that this could be beneficial for a short term and you know i think it  it would be fine  my father thinks it'd be fine  everybody i talk to says ya go for it  just to sort of break the cycle because this whole depression  that i've been going through it's not a real depression depression   well i mean it is  it's just this constant word   i wouldn't want to see a worse one  no i guess not eh  uhm ya it's been going on for like four months  three or four months now   and   ya   it's situation caused though  it's not it's not something that  like if that situation hadn't've had not have  happened i don't think you would be where you are  yes   no but  which i don't know if that makes a difference or not  it's situation caused but it's always been under the surface  it's always there  it's always under the surface  it's not like it just happened as a result of one incident and then it'll go away and i'll be bright and perky   no there's a term for that   ya   uhm no i've been like this since i've been really little  and it turns out i've found out that when i was five and they took me the first time i ever saw a psychiatrist was when i was five and my parents took me because i was just right out of control apparently  i wouldn't word   and you didn't know this before  ya ya i knew   ohh   well i knew because i don't know i knew  but they put me on some kind of drugs for about a month to break the pattern and uhm so it's  word remember this   and this is what tom said  he said you should i think i'm looking  at something for you for a few months to help break this pattern uhm or break out of the pattern   well idealistically this is what prozac is for  it's not a lifestyle  ya   i mean people laugh   laugh well unless it gets really good   who knows   laugh   methadone forever  exactly  we'll just create an entire race of people and have mood-altering drugs  laugh   ya   well anyway whatever  so i'm i'm sort of looking forward to that  i'm going to go to the group thing uhm because i think what he wants to do is have it so that eventually i'm   you know i'm not going to do the one on one with him  oh are you   because anytime i've seen him we've done it for maybe six months or three months or you know and then not done it for a few years and then come back for a few months and then not done it for a few years  but this would be like a constant  and you come and you go and and you use it to touch base and it might just sort of be a way of monitoring myself in a way while i learn how to do certain things and  mhh hmm   and i have to do  oh and i have he said now you know he said i don't want you to get into a relationship laugh for a while  he said that  ya he said this would be a really foolish thing and i said ugh i am i have no energy for a relationship  oh but energy relationships   give you so much energy  i have no relationships   well exactly   i mean they're so fuelling  ya   ya i know but i have no energy  i have no time  i just the last thing i want to do is even   i mean word   well you're a fool if you don't use this period in your life to really set up a foundation for the next  yup   and this is like no " a" great opportunity  you've got tom   you've got possibly group  yup  you've got medication that's there   yeah   i don't know i think i think  that's a really good chance  ya i think it'll be good   ya i do too actually  i think it's quite positive   and then uh and then just sort of move on from there  ya  but what i have to do also is start thinking about what i'm going to do  because i'm i'm s becoming a little  i have to do something else so that   like life-wise activity-wise what  career-wise  career-wise  but something that incorporates what i've been doing  at the uh at the museum  ya   uhm and teaching isn isn't   look looking   teaching is all   it's funny when i was in high school and it was the okay well   now y you   now you   teacher or nurse   ya teacher or nurse what are you be when you grow up   uhm i wanted to either work in museums or uhh teach high school visual arts  ya  and get a you know i was gonna   going to go and do the b f a and do the whole thing  and that was originally what i was gonna going to  do until you know all hell broke loose and i didn't go  so i'm back at that point again where that's really those are the things i'd really like to do and i'm thinking well i'm doing the museum aspect of it which is incorporating teaching  ya   so maybe it wouldn't be i mean maybe i should just go and see if i could do a a b ed   and even if i were teaching part-time or supply teaching i've already proven that with the type of lifestyle i have doing a whole bunch of different jobs matters is fine   mhh hmm   like i could work some shifts at the restaurant i can work at the museum i could go and supply teach at a school i can you know hop  around   ya   well you're in a nice position in a lot of different ways  man   so i mean i just   well ya i have no kids i have no marital obligation i have no person that i hafta have to  sort of  no you have to feed yourself and clothe yourself   two words and that's it  ya essentially ya  so i can do whatever i want  they say that you know yourself in terms of capability and what you should with your life you know yourself better at fourteen  than any other  the theory is you announce at some point in your adolescence what you want to be and it's generally right on the target  oh ya you told me this before   ya   and depending on the reaction you get  i remember you said that   cos i'm sure i said i don't know  you rocket scientist   or whatever and i was told i was a damn fool  that's right   i wanna want to be a   ya and somebody giggled   ya  ya and apparently even the strength you have when you're an adolescent you'd say it again and again and and  you'd get whatever reaction but if not one person says okay well  let's look let's go meet a rocket scientist  or whatever it gets lost  mhh hmm   and i for the life of me cannot think of what i said but i'm sure i had something  sounds interesting  and when you just said you know i thought when i was in high school i would be a teacher visual arts teacher in high school  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  ya or ya probably   like what is what what   is that art history or is it actual   hands on   oh that's like art history   well ya it's it's  studio and art history and photography and history of photography and  you know helping you know essentially working with students to you know get them their well an o c   did you have a class like that in high school   ya when you do your o c as perhaps a reference to the ontario college of art and stuff you're helping them get their portfolio pulled together if they wanna want to go to art school or or go into the art field and you  you know they learn about architecture and design and stuff like that and they you know  but i had an art teacher that was completely ludicrous  she was like a right right  loony  mhh   we were doing uh popsicle sculptures in what was grade thirteen and i was trying to put together a portfolio for university and i'm going popsicle sculptures what the hell is this  that must have been quite weird   we did a lot of crafts and i just thought it was just really appalling so   but i i would i'd really like to  work with that age group  they're annoying but they're also really really neat  ya  uhm really neat  but you don't want to do anything therapy-wise  you don't want to do art therapy or learning disabled artwork or  well i don't know maybe   cos that's quite cool   painting for the blind laugh   laugh   blind photography  exactly  i don't know  no no  uhm   that sounds amazing  well maybe  i mean you never know because things things   lead to another thing and thin things    i'm just thinking cos teachers' college mainstream teachers' college is really well i don't mean to say anything negative at all but it's just not that easy to get into  and if you were to arm yourself with some type of  counsellor thing whatever but   no i know   i know  well i've got i've got  visual arts and and english so  i'd like to uh i'll just have to see what i can do  oh let's go to ottawa u  university next week then  ya  we'll go one morning   word go and find out what  i have to do  and i may have to do a whole year of upgrading before i can apply to teachers' college  and how many   and who knows i might have to go and  i might have to go to like some teachers' college out in boonieville
