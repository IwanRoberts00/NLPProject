 hello  hello  hey  how ya you doing  not bad  good audible click   how are your squirrels  what  how are your squirrels  laugh no not bad   two words really active this afternoon   saw the chipmunk  uh huh  laugh he was uh it was just funny  it was it's well i mean of course it's normal but it was just like uh the same kind of like it was like  early evening and it's just like word remembered the same light that they had the last time i spotted them i just happened to look out the window and i see two squirrels and the chipmunk that are out   audible intake of breath and they were collecting like the ten million acorns that are in our backyard  ah okay   so cute  huh  i dunno don't know at one point the squirrel they spazzed out for like no reas i don't know what happened one of them like for absolutely no reason s   was like nothing within like a hundred anyway  there was nothing at all and all of a sudden they just went nuts  word   the one of them runs on a tree and he's like you know when they hang upside down word tree and he's got his nut in his mouth and he's flicking his tail and he's really like pissed off at something but i didn't see anything  laugh   m i'm like what's wrong with you  word so cute   oh it was just so cute watching   laugh he hurt his mou   he hurt the inside of his mouth on an acorn or something and got really ticked or  something   i know   he'd gotten all jumpy  s it's just like he'd been scared you know cos anyway cos i been watching him i did my ethogram there  oh and of course right now that i've done my ethogram  audible breath what do i get to see but i see one squirrel actually taking the time to kind of rest and self-groom himself  anyway  and s what do you mean well  like groom like  yeah  they groom themselves   obviously it's self-groom well no it could   be   no no they can well for example you know  like baboons or whatever groom each other   yeah two words baboons  would groom other people  laugh   well  just wander up to you and go hey what are you doing  laugh   it's a baboon behind you just grooming you you know  laugh   your hair it must do something   laugh   get the whole paddy fingers you know on your hair and you're just like what's going on you know  baboons just you know   laugh   baboon you groom get up there five bucks an hour  laugh   anyway so he's sitting there and he's like he's  you know i guess he had an itch or two and he starts like you know licking and scratching parts of his leg which of course would have been great to include in my ethogram but i hadn't really seen  it and i cou and i couldn't make it up cos i've never really seen  squirrels   uh okay   laugh   well you know they're kind of a nervous sort so you  coulda could have made some stuff up  you know word   well no cos the guy's an animal behaviourist right and like and they sugge on top of it they really suggested squirrels  okay  so the guy's had a he probably knows   the squirrel set of behaviours off by heart you know he probably had to learn it for his degree  or something   uh okay   laugh   word i popped up with this new  new behaviour should be like  cough   oh that's very interesting i didn't know they could build huts  w tell me more about it and i'd be like  uhh   they can build laugh starts they can build huts laugh ends squirrels building like two split levels in your backyard you know  laugh ah hang on word the other line okay  kay okay   hang on a sec pause while speaker a answers the other line, approximately fifteen to twenty seconds.   hello  hello  anyway so i didn't wanna want to   like i c i i did make up well didn't make up but i recalled some behaviours of my past which i kind of included but this woulda would have been great you know  all i got for grooming i that i  could put in was i saw one like start scratching itself like just had a spazzy itch there but this guy was like licking himself and all this  hmm   grooming  they seemed and it was also it just they li  like there was one of them th   i think he was a male  uh huh  well i no i make that guess i didn't see really any teats there but doesn't really matter   laugh   cos i saw a couple i saw a couple   which i knew were females because they had teats and and obviously they had been like they had had kids this year or whatever   uh okay   but this guy didn't seem to have anything but i mean it could have been like a virgin female but anyway  he seemed really calm though like unusually calm  mhm   snort   like he wasn't you know the way they  they quickly the way they eat their nuts like they're two or three words like  thr they're gonna going to  have indigestion like if we eat that fast   so it's sort of a slow day   laugh   but this guy was really taking his time anyway   it was just sort of it was sort of unusual  alright   so cute  huh  so that was it  and then the chipmunk was his usual audible breath man that routine eh  he gets out of his you know pops out of   his uh you know his hole   yeah  gets up on the on the little lawn chair that we have there looks around  he's audible click completely immobile  then he runs off grabs the nut never goes too far eh  okay  couple yards couple meters two words    well i mean chipmunks don't live in trees   i don't know  don't you i think you have like a  ground dwelling chipmunk or something  i don't know   well i don't know no i got the impression they didn't live in trees  cough   i thought they'd live on the ground   but i don't know i i sigh  sigh sounds like 'tfff' i dunno don't know    hm  anyway he never goes far from his hole  okay  and he comes running back  yeah  and then uhh real nervous-like cos he pops back into his thing  i saw him shove a few nuts like i saw him like he was definitely putting them in his pouches which was really cute  okay  and they kind of put it in like they're doing something in their mouth and then suddenly his it it's not   just his cheeks eh it's like his cheek and lower neck  like his whole   uh huh   anyways it's sort of interesting to imagine how big the pouch is because he shoves in two good nuts there and then he runs for his den  laugh the biggest part is getting the old cheeks through the doorway  like you think   like you think the squirrels are nervous but he's like a mess  oh really laugh   laugh like the squirrels they hang out in your backyard  a mess   this guy like he just emerges and goes back in and emerges and goes back in like you know  hmm  word that cat that cat you have next door that's you know  like he   that may that might do it  laugh   the that might be the   i thought maybe that was it a cat that'd uh you know that had somehow creeped into the uh to the  area but i didn't see anything  mm hmm  s it was  funny  hmm  so that's it   they're so sweet  shoulda should have had the   one of those we need one of those paint guns chase cats away with er not chase them away but  not paint guns you mean uh super soakers  hmm d yeah that's true they hate to get wet but a paint gun would be pretty effective too  that would kill the cat i think a paint gun  audible intake of breath aarh well not something really t not something that's you know   i think super soakers my friend ac  my friend a guy i kn in animal behaviour class we were  sposed supposed to get into a group and like we're supposed to discuss something that audible breath   something important   uh huh   but we didn't understand what it was so we ended up degenerating on animal laugh starts on animal topics  laugh ends   snort   and when clark was talking about the time he'd gone  audible intake of breath uh cat bowling and laugh   laugh oh i remember him telling about that   long laugh   and then word laugh   and um oh and then jonathan this other guy was like he heard him saying how the best way to train a cat was to get was to get like a super soaker gun  mm hmm  and he says what you do is he says it works for anything  you just you could just decide one day that there's one square foot of ground that you don't want your cat to stand in  laugh   laugh   for no reason at all  cos this is what he did and he put like you can even mark it off if you want  there's this one square foot of ground that you just don't want  th and everytime he gets there you squirt him with the uh with the gun  and he goes and it works laugh   laugh   then he goes w j well also and then they were suggesting things like yeah then every time you leave the house you have to put a cover over that piece of ground so he doesn't you know so if he steps on it like it was different cos if you stepped on it  anyway  okay   audible breath he was just saying it really worked and then you get this cat that basically will not go near  one square foot of ground for absolutely no reason you know  long laugh   cos he trained him with his two words    this was done ocourse of course   all in the name of science   oh ri of course  of course yeah   laugh   just wasn't because he didn't have anything better to do that day s   no   anyway  laugh   works great  huh  that's pretty cool s pretty cool  cos yeah cos th we were saying because the thing is you know when you don't want them standing on the table so like  see they don't you know they don't  realise they're doing anything wrong they're just walking  word   they're just cats   they're walking across your shelf they didn't realize that porcelain thing was valuable they just walked across it got in its way and pushed it out you know   mm hmm   sniff   across your what   word or two   and it pushed it out or pushed it word    no across your what   your shelves or  something what did i say  oh okay   you said shehbin or something   oh i meant shelves i think  okay  anyway   so that's it  cool  it was kind of funny  ah i'm really oh two well i saw i saw  the simpsons did you see it  ohh was on tonight eh no i didn't  ah i watched it for you  yeah  was i new one or an  old one   uh n   i think it was a new one  sideshow bob gets elected mayor  sideshow bob gets elected mayor  yeah he gets out he gets out  of prison and he gets elected mayor  and then they had this scene from a few good men   yeah  uhh oh   which one   because basically okay he gets elected mayor it's  ou simpsons   okay does homer vote for him   laugh he got a hundred percent votes   two or three words   laugh really  and he's like it was like  the the the vo votes finally came in it was like sideshow bob one hundred percent and then qu mayor quimby  one percent  and then the guy goes please note there's a one percent error   laugh two words   laugh   so then lisa suspects that   you don't scare me that could be anybody's ass  what  that's one time uh uh chief wiggum was uh   was threatening uh quimby  he said hey watch what you say i got pictures of you  he goes you don't scare me in that like ted kennedy type of   voice   ohh   you don't scare me those could be that could be anybody's ass  laugh   so i ws   it was pretty funny   anyway so he gets elected mayor and then he's tries to uh well he wants to build a f a freeway right across the simpsons' house   really   and they have seventy-two hours to evacuate and  in seventy-two hours if they're not out they blow up the house and   any remaining barts any remaining simpsons that are in there
