seeks to exploit it where we see cases and we try to fix the system that allows those cases to take place audience response   and the and there is a big difference because the gory details day in and day out mister speaker give no satisfaction and no pleasure to any member on this side as it doesn't give any pleasure and satisfaction to that side mister speaker  we have laws  we also have a process  we also move to deport individuals and we have  and we will further strengthen that  i will give a commitment to look into those individual cases but mister speaker i refuse to engage on the floor of the house of commons to give out justice reform party style applause   the honourable member for calgary northeast  supplemental mister speaker   while at the present time we are waiting for

guarantee canadians that he will never ever enter canada again applause   the honurable minister of immigration  mister speaker uh firstly i'm i'm i'm   not aware of the individual case  secondly if the honourable member is as concerned about this case as he demonstrates on the floor of the house of commons i caution him that that excitement can in f in in fact throw the case out because he and other members could be in contempt of court  and why don't you audience commotion   why don't you  firstly why don't you settle down  maybe you should settle down firstly  and secondly   secondly if we do have the case at heart and we want to create justice don't be in contempt of court and don't give that individual any further legal angles applause   i'm sure uh all honourable members will want to include the speaker in their in their answers and in their questions absolutely  french introduction   french, 20 seconds   the honourable minister of transport  french, 25 seconds   i want to say mister speaker that uh although we don't have any regulatory power on this particular issue uh it is with a great degree of sadness that we learned of this kind of situation having developed in haiti  if in fact if in fact the uh  the uh allegations are correct  and we will want to inquire  and i'm sure that the carrier in question will want to explain uh the facts of the situation to make sure that canadians understand exactly what did take place  french introduction   french, 30 seconds   french introduction applause   mister speaker normally documentation is uh normally required after a refugee is accepted and upon landing  i think my officials and it would be uhh easily understood that i think documentation for a number of individuals is impossible if in fact they are too refugees and if they are in fact fleeing from that regime that documentation sometimes is an impossibility which is taken into account  the honourable member for prince george-peace river  applause   thank you mister speaker  my question is for the minister of justice  we have been told that law abiding firearms owners are the primary source of guns used in crime because their firearms can be stolen  accurate information regarding the sources of guns for criminals is necessary to determine if further firearms controls will reduce gun related crime yet the statistics are unavailable  mister speaker will the minister undertake a comprehensive national study to determine the source of firearms for criminal activities and will he make the information readily available to all canadians  applause   the honourab honourable  parliamentary secretary  mis mister speaker  we we we don't have accurate statistics on the availability of of firearms for illegal purposes  as the honourable member has said uh there are  st statistics those who say that uh most of the firearms that get into the hands of criminals are   are stolen  uh the the uh the official opposition yesterday said that it was uh smu smuggled  that w firearms smuggled across the border were the main concern  we are in the in the ministry of justice looking into this  the minister has uh given his undertaking that he will get as much information on this question as he possibly can and make it available to the house applause   the honourable member for yukon  word speaker  uh mister speaker my question is for the minister of transport  recently the minister gave an address uh outlining the government's plans to systematically dismantle the transportation system in this country and it should have been entitled goodbye to the national dream  mister speaker the minister calls his plan  commercialization but it is clear that he means  privatization and will affect seventy-five per cent of the department's activities  and i want to ask the minister to be clear with canadians  his policy clearly follows the tory royal commission on transport  and i'd like to ask the minister to explain how his plan to commercialize is different from the tory's plan to privatize which he opposed so vehemently in the last parliament  the honourable minister of transport  yes uh mister speaker i i want to assure uh my honourable colleague that there is no intention to dismantle the transportation system  what in fact we're trying to do mister speaker is to ensure that there is an integrated affordable transportation system available to canadians to move move both people and products  but i want to say to my honourable colleague that uh many uh people who follow the transportation scene will recognize uh in the commercialization approach that we are trying to maintain the government of canada's involvement in a supervisory a regulatory a a   policy uh way uh uh the the work that we're doing in transportation but we also understand that we have to have business and commercial practices applied to the way we do administer the transportation system  mister speaker the people who've been around ha   have seen former uh ministers of transport uh uh  of a of a liberal stripe attempt to do these kinds of things  it is not a tory agenda  it's an agenda designed to provide canada with a transportation system that will support the economy that's required to pay for the social programs that are at the heart of liberal policy applause   my colleagues i i have a i have a   point of order from uh the honourable government whip   thank you mister speaker  mister speaker i think you will find the unanimous consent to put forthwith all questions necessary to dispose of the report stage of bill c twenty-eight without further debate and to dispense the ringing of the bell on any record division   is there unanimous consent audience shouts " agreed"   agreed and so ordered   french, 18 minutes   questions and comments  the honourable member for scarborough-agincourt   madam speaker i've been working on amendments to the young offenders act since the day i was elected  i want to share with my colleage across because some of the things that i have heard just certainly i could not comprehend  the the this particular act that we're dealing with right now was first tested in nineteen eighty-five when a young individual in my riding killed uh three people a mother a father and a seven-year old uh daughter  this young offender received in total three years  my constituents were just just just could  there were no words to describe their feelings  what i'm hearing from the honourable member is that the liberal party wanting to appease the re uh the the reform    madam speaker i don't think the liberal party brought this  this changes about because of the reform party  the liberal party long time was a a a a  beacon of changes to the to the young offenders act  and certainly i disagree with my colleague is saying  my colleague is saying that in a civilized and industrial world   we move from we should have something which is called  adolescent   well this young individual that snuffed snuffed madam speaker three lives he was not an adolescent  he had moved already into that particular world which is called an adult  he committed a crime   there's a saying that says you do the crime you pay the time   now i've heard with great interest the speaker the the my uh my honourable colleague saying that we don't need prisons we need rehabilitation and i cre i quite agree we need rehabilitation  but the one question that i have for the honurable member is the following  what in her view should a young offender get when that individual commits a severe crime such as a killing or a rape  do we say no no it's a nice nice young adolescent don't worry about it we're gonna going to   give you a pat on the back and you're not old enough to do it or are we gonna going to say to that adolescent you did the crime you gotta got to pay the time  more more at home madam speaker if a young offender were to kill a member of her family what would the honourable member precisely want to see the justice to be served and what kind of time should that young offender be paying  french introduction   french, 1 minute 30 seconds   le honorable dep   i'm sorry  the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby   thank you madam speaker  uhm uh my colleague in her speech mentioned that the preamble uh of the amendments to the young offenders act falls very short and i would just like her to comment what does my colleague from quebec say about what should be the balance between uh victim's needs and offender's needs uh as outlined uh in the preamble as to the general direction as to where the act uh should be administered  i notice that uhm the word victim i don't believe is not mentioned at all in the preamble and i would like her views on the balance between uhh victim's needs and offender's needs especially as it should be outlined in the preamble of the young offenders act  french introduction   french, 2 minutes 20 seconds   french introduction   french, 2 minutes 40 seconds   french introduction   french, 1 minute 50 seconds   resuming debate applause the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  madam speaker i'm pleased to rise uh and speak today in support of the government's recent actions cough to crack down on violent young offenders who commit serious crimes  madam speaker i'd like to uh sort of preambulate my speech by saying that we all have responsibilities in this country of canada that we shouldn't predicate the effectiveness of programs uhm on what our   p political agendas are  i think we have a responsibility for the young people of this country and this piece of legislation and the amendments are to clearly to address the needs that are there  uhm i must say that i'm happy to be a member of parliament and a contributing member so to speak that will perhaps add to a healthy debate  and makes viable suggestions that would fortify the country bring people together and to carve out a future for young people in this country rather than to talk about some rather destructive means uh that uhm would  not bring any enjoyment or any good health to the country such as it is  i'm pleased uh uh on june the second the minister of justice tabled amendments to the young offenders act  these amendments recognize the public's growing concern about  youth violence and demonstrate the priority this government places on protecting the public  these amendments uh by shifting the onus on young people to take responsibility for their violent crimes sends a strong signal to young people that their actions carry serious consequences
