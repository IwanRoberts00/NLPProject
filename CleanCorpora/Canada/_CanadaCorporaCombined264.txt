traffic this morning is cam jeffrey   good morning  good morning jim   and uh things working well in traffic right now as you would expect uh at this time of the morning especially in july  just uh another uh closing here to mention in terms of uh construction  and uh this one on the southshore in st-hubert  the one sixteen will be closed beginning tonight at ten o'clock uh between taschereau and cousineau boulevards and that continues right till monday morning  and actually what i do jim is i send out kyle dravitski with orange road cones to close off lanes so i have things to say when there's no traffic   but right now otherwise things look good in traffic   ah expos uh finished off the homestand with a victory   a good one   oh yes in front of almost eighteen thousand fans they won four to nothing over the cubs yesterday  butch henry was just spectacular  so was the defence behind them especially mike lansing who turned  a gorgeous double play in the seventh inning it was unassisted uh   we well actually it was assisted cos of the drive through the mound off the glove of uh butch henry   and he managed to snag the ball that uh trickled to second base touched the bag throw to first for the double play to get henry out of a jam  it was really the only one that he was in in the game cos uhm it was uh first and third at that point for the cubbies  again four to nothing  i spoke with butch henry afterwards  he said what made the game a complete game for him all the more surprising where he only gave up seven hits is that beforehand he just didn't feel that great physically   when i came in today and soaked in the sauna beforehand and uh it just uh you know i got out there in the first inning and i was i was excellent speaks to another person i was real uh real  wired  i do i don't know why i mean  i was i was just out there uh you know uh   everything everything looked like it was going ninety miles an hour and it i i you know i whizzed through that first inning and i was like wow laugh  american   i don't know how i did that   butch henry uh   is is butch an american uh kid  oh laugh he asks facetiously   laugh kinda kind of     yeah uh  and you know the reason why i guess uh he got the nickname butch is because uh i believe his given names are reed bluford actually floyd bluford   i have to check that words   i'd take butch   you'd take butch over those then   i'd take butch  you betcha  so good news uh for the expos and their fans because uh   five hundred   five hundred  they are uh seven and two on that homestand  they go to pittsburgh to start a five-game road series  they are now two and a half games back of the phillies and just three games back of uh houston if i'm reading that correctly  and uh houston has the last uh wildcard spot right now or the only wildcard spart not " spot" in the national league  ah colorado by the way beat the phillies yesterday seven to three  atlanta beat pittsburgh the score there was four to three  bit of a disappointing note from the world of baseball has to do with duke snider and willie mccovey  they both plead guilty yesterday to tax evasion  snider sixty-eight years old   s a it's a  sad story  you like me remember him uh for many reasons  one is that he was a colour commentator for the expos for many years  also in his playing days a star centre-fielder with the brooklyn dodgers one of the famed uh boys of summer in the nineteen fifties   when the bums nickname finally won the pennant    yeah and then the world series   that's   yeah  so he uh failed to report more than a hundred grand in income between eighty-four and ninety-three  most of that money coming from card shows and the like  he faces up to six months in jail and fines that could reach as much as two hundred and fifty grand  uh tom watson sharing the first round lead at the british open  watson shooting for his sixth british open title  if his putting holds up he just could make a run for it   but don't forget uh there was e the   same scenario last year where he started out so well in the early rounds and then couldn't hang on  the difficulty with golfers is that as you get older it's tough to hold it through all the rounds through the four rounds and uh stick with the younger guys  it's just an energy thing   specially especially on those  eng english links courses   yeah  low whistle   uh he's tied right now with zimbabwe's mark mcnulty at five under and uh they both shot a sixty-seven  jack nicklaus by the way is uhm uh i guess uh at par at seventy-eight so a few strokes back  uh he made a ten on hole number fourteen  he got caught in uh that bunker that they refer to as the hell bunker and uh too took four  strokes to get out of the bunker  brutal   brutal   and it was a beautiful british open day  overcast about fifty-five to sixty degrees laugh   uh raining  it was it was wonderful   i just loved it   typical  the weather   and you s this is  your favourite four

were bothering him over in europe a few weeks ago  he had trouble with ah his uh asthma over there  uh as as many players do because of the grass and uh different pollen uh out in europe  but uh now he's back home  he we've been home for a couple of weeks and uh we've been training pretty hard and hi his  his health is uh pretty much back to normal now  marty laurendeau talking about uh sebastien lareau  lareau uh is in a challenger tournament in granby  didn't get to play yesterday in the quarters because of the rain and the wind  he'll hopefully play his quarters today if the weather holds

thanks cam   cam will be back uh before six thirty with another update on what's happening uh on the roads around montreal  in sports of course the canadian open is the big story and uh greg rusedski played his singles match yesterday  uh didn't look to be in top form  ended up losing to american michael joyce  the score there was seven six six three and he definitely was being booed especially in the first set of that one  uh after he lost the match the fans uh started singing na na na na na na na na hey hey goodbye so uh that's how they felt about him  but he did come back in the evening and his and won his doubles match against uh lareau and leblanc  should mention as well though that there were uh rusedski supporters in the crowd yesterday afternoon  uh some people actually had a big banner saying we love you greg bienvenue &agrave; montr&eacute;al   welcome to montreal   and uh there were some people who were cheering but they were definitely outnumbered yesterday  uhm there was one upset yesterday and that was uh volkov who lost his match  and uh i wish i could tell you who he lost to but uh laugh  don't have that in front of me
