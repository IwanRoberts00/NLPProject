 so over here in setup you have your d v three background okay  so you could uhh  you'll have to put more in that one   comments   uhm anyways usually you'll use the black  and i'll show you  you might wanna want to fade to black  fade out from black  technically you could fade to yellow and out from yellow   uhm here we'll come back to the setup later uhm  okay this is the main thing  your main screen is your first scene  that's your first scene to be edited  the preview represents the beginning of the second scene  in between the first and the second you want a transition  okay  so in this case uh these this is my effects bag a  i've also got effects bag c d e f g   kay okay there's about well there's almost two hundred effects here laughing in audience   uh which is why it can take a while just to figure out what it is you're doing  some of them are really graphic  like here for example watch the screen baaing starts over here  he's got sheep falling from the sky baaing ends  kay okay which is a bit well graphic i mean  comments   some of them do but in any case the sound isn't being transferred  we don't we're not set up for it so you just hear it and uhm  kay okay so this is what you spend a lot of time playing  you just come and and try out some of these effects uhh sound effect in background   that kind of thing  and then you've also got your more   well actually i'm just gonna going to  show you a real cheesy one here laughter from audience   boys have their own of course laughter from audience   and mister clean   they become part of the content of your video okay so  comments   beware  well it's sort of i mean some of this is pretty tacky really  and uh it's really how you use it  there are some more subtle ones here  you've got your wipes uh  your soft wipes and your uhm your  hold on  comments   split screen  now it doesn't digitize it   it doesn't shrink it  although one of them will  i'll show you that in a second  this is good to know about though cos you can shoot for this easily enough   heavy to the left heavy to the right and then combine the two  uhm  so what i'm doing here is i highlight once and i can either  well i can come down here and choose a speed slow medium fast  and then i can trigger the effect by clicking on the effect once again  or i can click on auto   or i can use the t bar  left mouse button and just drag it and just control it and leave it right there   and when an effect is in motion the screen usually distorts in some way or another  and or i could also hit the space bar  you wanna want to hit the space bar  okay so you can trigger it in a f quite a few different ways depending on who you're working with and how you're working  uhm now there are a couple which actually digitize   ah let me just find one  okay this one for example  okay see what it's done  it takes the incoming image uhm as a whole  kay okay it doesn't cut it up or anything  so now i can just like move it around and tuck it anywhere and they can both be removed pause about ten seconds   okay   so you can do this sorta sort of thing  uh there's also a couple that actually superimpose themselves over your image  word snow word  accumulations audience laughter   uhm and then there's also this kind of deep space thing or something audience laughter   and then there is something called the old movie  cos you got rid of your dust and your scratches  in the chrome effects you can combine this with black and white  kay okay so you just take the colour right outta out of your video  asks a question   yeah i'll show you that in a second  yeah they're filters kay okay   uhm anyways this is the sort of thing you come in and play with  dissolve's at the end of every effects bank  so again using the t bar i can just leave it as kind of a transparent superimpose   okay  and i can record that as long as i want to   or i could just take it right out  okay  starts to ask a question   there's also something called the superimpose here which is uhm well anyway i'll  let me just show you  they call it a superimpose  it's more of a luminance keyer which means it'll key a white or a black signal out  okay and i'll show you uhm  asks a question   yeah yeah uh well i'll just show you  asks a question   no you can't set it up quite that way  if i click on dissolve i'll go back here to setup there is the effect speeds  the default is slow medium fast  i can also go to variable though   which means that back here in my dissolve i've got a number grid  so you've got you could have a pretty slow dissolve here  you'd have to experiment with it to get it to that timing  aks a question   you can do  yeah you have to do it manually  yeah   but you can do it on the cut  you would just do it manually  comments   there there there is a system in here a g p i trigger which we did set up at one point but it was just so uh unpredictable that it's better to just do it yourself   uhm kay okay the superimpose  now let's match this up with three  kay okay now you see what's ha   can you see  comments   yeah  uhm i click either on black or white and then this number system here is like a it's a numbered t bar okay  so left mouse button and i'll just scroll   okay so what happens is that the blacks go first and are replaced with another video image you see  uhm and again using this this uh scroll bar i can eventually take it right out if i want  comments   yeah  yeah i can kinda kind of determine the grade of that key  or you can go to white and key out the whites pause about ten seconds   alright  so it has its uses pause about ten seconds   and again this is the sort of thing where if you  if you know about it uhm then you can kinda  kind of shoot with that in mind a bit pause about ten seconds  okay so for example i've got more of a sky here pause about ten seconds   okay that's keyed out pause about ten seconds   alright  anyway   okay so again like all the stuff i'm doing there's little tutorials in the manual as you do everything  it's pretty good that way  uhm alright so the other thing here is the freeze frame   just choose something   the really big thing to remember about the switcher and it can be a bit confusing is that uh when you're when you're  using the editor you're just sorta sort of   concerned with the first scenario that you're editing okay  you cut that and then you're back to finding the other one  uhm in this case you've gotta got to  find scene one and also the beginning of scene two for your other transition between the two  okay so there's another step to it  you've got three end points as opposed to two end points  uhm pause about 12 seconds   kay okay now i'll just frame grab this quickly  it's really pretty simple to frame grab   kay okay let's just say here  uh the freeze button comes up highlit as a default  first thing you do is take it off  whatever you want to grab you'll put in the preview  and uh click on your d vs and press freeze okay  so that's now become uhm a freeze frame and it's stored in d v two  these are also called frame buffers  they're quite temporary  if you start muckin mucking around a little bit chances are you'll lose it  so unless you're gonna going to use it right away you might wanna want to take it to setup and save it to the hard drive and call it back again later on okay  if you wanna want to save stuff to the hard drive generally speaking just ask somebody on staff to take you through how to do that  the manual uhm doesn't really show you like with our system of course so   just let somebody know  uhm i'll just go to save  now i'll find an empty frame   kay okay so let's just call it loud cough in audience word donuts and then save to the hard drive now  so if we lose it we can call it back  and uhm we're going to paint all over this frame is what we're  gonna going to do sneeze in audience  pause about 5 seconds sneeze in audience   okay   now one thing uhm which i talked touched   on just a little bit before there was sometimes on your uh  on your tape you've got two images that you  wanna want to dissolve to and uh i mean you can do a couple of things here  you could make a copy of that tape and use it as another source  or you could for example  alright let's just say this is scene one here  i'll just dissolve to black for example  i'll use that   uhm looks like it's fast  something like that pause about 25 seconds   kay okay are you with me so far   comments   i mean usually this is like a four hour workshop so i'm  moving pretty quickly   alright and then whatever  at any time you fade to black   and that   whenever you're in the recorder as well you're not going to see  the toaster  i can i can click on all kinds of things here kay okay   it's all happening in the player side  this is an output  so once i've got something on my recorder i can't throw a dissolve onto the scene for example  you have to do that as it's being processed through the player  okay  that's something that people sometimes find a little bit hard to get their head around  that is an output only   it's not represented on bus at all pause about 18 seconds   kay okay fade to black uhm  find the next scene  let's say there  and this time i'll fade up from black   so my first scene here is d v three  it's the colour background that's gonna going to  be edited first and i'm gonna going to  dissolve to input two which is the player  okay so you can only see your preview waiting there   kay okay so as soon as it beeped   i i triggered the effect pause about fifteen seconds   okay  so that's one way around it  it's a pretty common device really   uhm and it's a way of keeping your sound organized  there's also the match frame edit uhm which i could show you  what you have to leave a specific time here  comments   yeah  i just wonder if it's it's worth showing you or maybe i can just explain it to you  what i did here was find uh scene one and scene two  in a match frame i would freeze frame the first frame of the second scene set that up here   maybe i should just show you  actually i think that'd make more sense  comments   okay okay i'm gonna going to show you pause about five seconds   somebody tried to speak  okay  uhm alright so we'll never mind this for now and pretend there is not  okay  this one  i'm gonna going to grab this one okay  so could you  does somebody have a pen  they could take note of this  one zero zero forty oh one   muttering from speaker and audience all at once one zero zero forty oh one  forty oh one  alright so i'm gonna going to grab this  okay that's frozen  let's go save this to setup again  in fact i think i'll hold on to that idea   whispering starts i'm gonna going to  close the door  it's really drafty up here whispering ends   kay okay so that's the first frame of scene two   asks a question   it's saving it  asks a question   ah it's the first frame of the second scene   comments laughter from audience  alright so first frame scene two  now let's find first frame scene one
