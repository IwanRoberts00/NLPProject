 it's an affront to democracy to tell quebecers they have the right to throw the constitution of canada into the garbage   it's an affront to democracy to tell canadians they have no say in the borders of their own country   and it's an affront to democracy to think that a separatist elite has the right to deprive twenty-seven million canadians of their right to stability  it's also an affront to democracy to think that the cree and the inuit can be moved like cattle from one jurisdiction to another against their will  lucien bouchard has also suggested that canada is a prison  first he said canada's not a real country   now he said canada is a prison   twenty-seven million canadians think canada is the greatest country in the world  and if lucien bouchard and his followers think that canada is a prison they can form their own ethno-centric state but they can't kidnap three-and-a-half million people to go aga   along with them against their will  because separatists are not the only ones to have the right to self-determination  cos i can guarantee you that at least three-and-a-half million quebecers would much rather live in the prison of canada than the quebec-style democracy of lucien bouchard and pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;  uh what should we be discussing this hour  should pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; uh resign  is his report an affront to democracy  next hour i'll be asking you if canada's a prison  that was the main headline this morning in the journal de montr&eacute;al   and in the third hour we'll look at daniel johnson and the quebec liberals  uh will they agree with separatists that quebec has the right to use a referendum victory to trash the canadian constitution  we know that jean charest is uh siding with the separatists that the federal government should not have intervened  we'll see were the quebec liberals stand  the number to call is seven nine oh oh nine nine one  star eight two five five for bell mobility subscribers  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d  and this hour our topic pierre f his report  is it an affront to democracy and do you believe that he should resign  uh we'll go to uh our first caller  let's go to sydney   good afternoon  you're on c j a d  good afternoon  how're you doing  fine how are you  laugh i don't know how i am living where i am  uhm i just wanted to touch base with you  first of all i'm glad you're still talking about this fraud thing cos i think it's it's probably more important right now than even the uh the hebert court case  i find it incredible that pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report stopped where it did  or that he stopped where where it did  to answer your question i don't think he will resign  but i do think that we as a population and uh we've got to stir up  our our politicians to get them digging further into this thing  and i i think if we if we keep digging we'll pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; will probably wind up being fired if not charged  i think we shouldn't give up on it  i heard uh thomas mulcair the m n a member of the national assembly for chomedey who fought this brave fight from the beginning  he's not giving up on it  he's upset with uh pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s conclusions  i'm upset by it  i think many people are upset by it  this is absurd  i mean tell this to anyone  again the same thing applies as uh applies to everything else in quebec  try telling this to somebody outside this province or outside this country  twenty-two thousand twenty-two thousand boxes untouched  out of twenty-two thousand-three-hundred   it's an absurdity  laugh i know it's   it's incredible  i watched last night i watched le point and uh pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; was interviewed  i don't know if you saw it or heard of it  but he again restated which i guess had said earlier   uh that the unity rally was more an affront to quebec's democracy than than the electoral fraud  okay i'm glad you brought that up  i want to get to the uh  i want to get to the unity rally  and we'll do that and we'll also be back with more of your calls after we hear from kenny mulder with c j a d skywatch traffic   we are back  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d  we're talking about pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; and whether or not he should uh resign  he thinks uh he's very upset about uh about   people coming to uh montreal for the canada day rally  he's not that upset about out and out voter fraud and stealing of ballots but when it comes to this rally he's quite upset and he feels that uh companies and individuals uh outside quebec were involved in last fall's unity rally  now this is gone to to lengths that are truly ab absurd   in this country we have freedom of speech  we have freedom of assembly  we have freedom to travel  but there is such a state of delusion in quebec that the electoral officer feels that before people can decide whether they will travel to quebec during referendum they have to have daniel johnson approve their expenses  i'm not making this up  this is what what is happening  it is outrageous  now a lot of the people of course refuse to even talk to his   investig investigators cos they have uh no uh right to do that  most uh legal experts agree that quebec can't possibly make its referendum law stick against transactions that took place beyond uh the borders of uh quebec  the sale of a ticket or the the rental of a bus  i mean there is freedom of assembly  people have the right to come to quebec  quebec is still part of canada  they can travel here and march here and put up a a banner and do what they want  to suggest that they have to have these expenses approved by the head of the no committee while they ignore all the work the unions did  it's it's there's only one word for it and that word is absurd   let's go back to the phones  norman   good afternoon  you're on c j a d  good afternoon uh timmy   uh i know you're a master of words and a great debater  and uhm i not often agree with what you say but in general uhm i appreciate the way you defend your cause  you are not an analyst  you are a militant but that's alright with me  but i think this time you are pushing really too too far  and i think that uh mister uh what's his name laugh   mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;   mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;   and as judge uh goldbloom are both people of great competence and great integrity  wait wait a second  it's  first of all it's judge gold and the thing is in terms of the integrity  so as far as you're concerned looking at two-hundred-and-ninety is enough right  two-hundred-and-ninety boxes and leaving the and finding some fraud but nonetheless ignoring the twenty-two-thousand other boxes that's okay  okay let's put the thing in context  okay  they are twenty-thousand boxes okay  twenty-thousand-three-hundred-and-something  now on each boxes there was a representative of the no and a representative of the yes committee  that's right  and when there was a conflict the yes committee was the one that had the final decision  yes but   okay   a no member had a recourse  and as i know the militancy of the federalists i know  if why are we looking at twenty-nine boxes  because they complained there were irregularities there  and since then they have you have been trying everywhere to find if there were not any other places where there were  irregularities and they nobody came in with any one   well well norman norman ho  hold it hold it   norman you and i had this same conversation uh or a similar conversation yesterday  uh you have your theory i have you have   yes you cut me off during the same topic   yes you have your theory  i have mine  but i mean it certainly would have been easy to check a few more boxes to look into a few more ridings than just to look at three ridings very carefully  and the other issue uh over here norman that's very important  you're talking about how militant the federalists are  i'm telling you that uh for the no scrutineers   uh   excuse me let me finish  for the no scrutineers in lac saint jean it would have been pretty difficult for them to throw a big fuss because their neighbours and friends and relatives are all yes supporters  they didn't want to make a big issue out of it  so they may have let no votes been thrown out  what's wrong  listen   that's proof that's a tangent   so why don't you prove me wrong  i mean it's a there's a very easy way to prove that i'm wrong and that's by looking into the boxes   well if that's that's   and you know what  if they look into the other boxes and they find that there is no evidence of voter fraud in the other twenty-two thousand  they don't have to look into twenty-two thousand  let them look at another five hundred or a thousand and they find no evidence i will publicly apologize if they do that  thank you for calling  let's go to our next uh caller  we go to uh adam </@  good afternoon  you're on c j a d  hi timmy   uhm one of the things that i found rather bizarre  i mean it's a it's a serious issue but i mean it's sort of got asp twilight zone aspects  to it  when uhm pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; says that there's absolutely no evidence of a of a national conspiracy  well of course no one is actually talking about a national conspiracy  the worry is that there is a provincial conspiracy   conspiracy   no i i noticed that  that we use that that   even uh judge gold used the word uh national  conspiracy   yeah   yes i know  i don't think anyone in saskatoon was involved  no  right  and the other thing  i mean unless they're talking about the conspiracy to sell plane tickets  but what also strikes me as strange is fir   first of all they're they're   it looks like they were desperate to find something to  to take the attention away from what would normally be worrisome in a democracy like tampering with votes  uh they suppressed uhm free speech  i mean it's a matter of of public record that federalists like guy bertrand keith henderson and steven scott brent tyler wanted to actually argue publicly as a  as a political argument the issue of the rule of law  and for three of the four weeks they were suppressed by law   by from uh exercising that democratic right  right now   well i think that's why it's a very good idea that robert libman is taking this to uh the supreme court  the whole referendum law is unfair  these are rules made by separatists to make it uh convenient as possible and the other nationalist party doesn't like to do much to contradict them because they want to get these soft nationalist votes  and in the meanwhile all of the people of uh canada have to uh suffer  thank you for calling  we'll be back with more calls after we take this break  commercial advertisements   good afternoon  we're back  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d and our my previous caller norman  mentioned that i'm uh not really a political analyst but i'm a militant  well first of all i analyze politics uh for a living  but should i pretend that i don't care there's a difference whether this country's broken apart or not  should i tell you that i think living in a separate quebec is the same as living in canada  of course i'm not going to say anything as preposterous  i feel very proud to be canadian  i am proud to be a federalist  i'm not ashamed of it and i will not pretend to be neutral on the issue
