 so how was the body then  how was john   he was lying down  he was on his back  lying down on his back  yeah he was four or five words but i can't exactly word like  the person known as rick had like a two words    utterance   he had one hand on the top of his head and knife was to the throat  whose knife was to the throat  it was bart   where was bart then  he was at the head area   your evidence is they changed places  yes they did  and how was that  well you see when when a person's got ya you like when he's up and he's like his legs are broke it's not because you're not   you've got an edge because you've got a knife  it's your body you know like it's a matter of changing position  five or six words at three feet and you're already two or three words   and they did that again  yes  changed around pause about 15 seconds   and did you know what was going down at this time  no no you know well i rest of utterance  and did you you mentioned that   you you saw the robbery at that point   yeah  you saw uh  the pockets being emptied  who emptied the pockets  rick did rick and bart   you saw them take something out  yeah i didn't see exactly what it was but it turns out it was rest of utterance   but it was it was his front pocket  pause about 15 seconds   you gave a statement three or four words   yes i did  you read that statement today did you  uh no i read it yesterday about two and a half minutes untranscribed, speakers are too far away to hear, a statement is read  that certainly appears that you're two words  when you tell the police officers that the first thing you knew  of the robbery was when you were at jim thompson's house  word   but you just told us did you not that you watched the robbery  yeah  you lie to the police  nope  you lying now  actually no i'm not   it was just what i can remember over time it can't change what happened  but the robbery's a pretty crucial part wasn't it  like was that that's not just a little detail in your mind   well mind i don't look at it as crucial as some people might seem to reason  you know five or six words you know he robbed somebody he took a little money and he took a life  well it appeared to me that when you  pre-evidence when you talked with police officers and gave that statement you gave in the impression very clearly that you didn't know the robbery had taken place at the time that it was occurring  that's not the time   right so why didn't you tell them that pause about seven seconds   why   because i could  cos you thought you could get away with something  utterance   it wasn't because i thought it was because i could  i don't follow you sir   i could what  because i i'm not sure i can tell you why   two or three words right but cos four or five words   but what was in that statement okay it was true okay up until  like sure there are some parts where uh  like i didn't know if the if the  robbery was actually uh done right  okay at that point in time i'd been drinking by the case   i will tell you that  you know i had tried to quit on the side   that's right eh   just just just rest of utterance    no you three words   you got me worked up now  okay you're gonna going to  rest of utterance   thank you   and you know over time you know after being word  off that medication you know i like i said i   been word for almost a year now you know  your long term memory does start to come back  you do remember the fine little details  you know i mean   kay okay   so you're telling me your memory's better today than it was last march  yes because like you don't have these all  these chemicals running through your system  not even so much as tylenol for a headache  but you had been in cu when you gave the statement you had been in custody since the time of your arrest which was uh september thirtieth nineteen ninety-five the statement's march ninety-six  you'd been clean for some six months had you not  no i hadn't been not in there  alright  you were using in there were you  yes i was pause about 10 seconds   but you're not telling me you didn't know what you were doing because you used uh drugs or alcohol when you gave your statement are you  no i can't say that   so which version are you going with today just so i'm  understand about the robbery  i'm gonna going to stick to the statement the truth   and the statement says you didn't know about it until you got back   about the robbery  well i yes that's what i'm gonna going to  go with  that's exactly what i meant today  despite what you   one or two words   despite despite what i've said here you know   i word what are you gonna  going to do you know  you're gonna going to throw me in jail  i'm already in jail  i'm in my own little hell  you mean the worst thing we could do is throw you in jail for lying  well yeah you know  so you know   three or four words  because like being out they say like twelve hours a week you know that's a lie  but there's really no fear of that is there  you're you're already lost away  that's right  you got nothing to lose by lying  well i have a lot to lose i have a lot to lose  word   like rest of utterance interference on tape   you know i i i don't know about the others but i i word  interference on tape   because i found rest of utterance   and you're anxious to get back out there  i'm anxious to get back to my jail  well you're more anxious to get back out into stifled laugh society  no i want to get back to my jail  ah  it was a short cut  you're looking forward to getting released from jail  eventually   i understood your evidence is you didn't wanna   want to spend fifteen or twenty years in jail you wanted to get out you had a life you had a kid  right  right  but there's some things i just gotta got to  do before i get out   and unfortunately this is one of them  when you sigh left the uh  the scene where the body was  mm hmm  where did the word go  it was just in the dump with the green one where i went when i put it into the dumpster cos i saw the body drop  if i'd a i'd have known that there was  blood across the foot it wasn't rest of utterance   right  utterance   can i just stop you there for a moment   who put the knife in the dumpster   me pause about ten seconds   and i understand your evidence two or three words is that bart put or i'm sorry   rick put the knife in the in the   garbage can is that correct  utterance   what did you say  i said that bart had was  uh three or four words   okay   did you uhm where did he get that knife from  from me   because i i had taken the knife put them inside the lining of my jacket to where they could be seen  two or three words to somebody who just happened to be walking down the street or watching or whatever   so the knives you're saying that the knife that bart threw in the dumpster came from you  mm hmm  but who gave you that knife   i got i got all the knives from  folks you know like   you're not involved in this really are you at at the at the scene  no i i didn't go out i didn't kill nobody i didn't stab nobody  and you didn't   word   you did   i take responsibility for my actions you know i figure if people can do it i can do it for myself as well but   you you took their knives  yeah   why was that  because well i'm smart enough to know seven or eight words i wasn't given the chance to word  all of them  but i knew i knew where to put things  where they're not gonna going to be found  so it was your idea to put one knife in the   in the word   well i was gonna going to   i was all encouraged to put them all there but you know there's nothing going off in all different places   utterance pause about ten seconds   utterance pause about five seconds   so you would've had to take your trench coat off  yeah  well no i w w w  wouldn't have to at all actually because the lining you know  it's opening up the edge of the lining cut through the lining  you put three knives in there  yeah i did  you didn't take your trench coat off  not at that point in time  and when did you take your trench coat off  not until after after we got to uh joe's   you took the trench coat off at joe's   utterance   and there was one knife couple of garbage containers not the dumpster a bit smaller residential garbage container and was that knife thrown in there or put in there prior to going to joe's  yes  it was put in  thank god cos i don't word the garbage can  pardon me  i was word to my jacket   was the jacket still on  yeah two or three words   right  take it out of my jacket put it in the dumpster   garbage can   take your jacket off to fight   yeah   and who took the knife then interference on tape for about ten seconds   it wasn't me   who was it   let's see it wasn't me it wasn't bart  could be rick   rick did that  yeah  i mean it should be in that little word pile  pause about 7 seconds   you think so  i hope so   we'll just see end of tape   uhm you told us that you cheated at sometime in mid-october   you and smith sat down and sent out the uh letters that were required to six or seven words by virtue of the  two or three words   do i have that correct  i yeah that's that's around that uh date of that letter is when it came up  very quiet muttering   i agree  at that point obviously you must've had word  uhh  cos they had the address  i well obviously we we  sent out addresses  we sent out most of the subscription forms that we had  had one sub-development though  exactly yeah  so you would've had to develop a whole new one at that point  yeah  if for no other reason than because of that address  well that i i learned that i didn't handle all the forms right  i learned that i didn't have i dunno don't know two or three words for it  yeah okay   i didn't have  and then uhh with mister ramsey's form i'm like  i learned that i didn't have those  but for the ones that you were aware of obviously  loud noises drown out speaker for about seven seconds   yes i think i did   even at that point it wasn't it wasn't  that obvious the numbers yeah   cos we don't read them at all until the forms  two words   no and i don't know  no i mean i know that i had the form uhm and whether   whether i even looked or bothered to look whether there was a cheque   like my recollection was we had an extension   i wasn't i don't know if i was overly concerned  yeah but you told us that cough the proper way for you to two or three words was to collect a cheque and two words subscription  and again we know from the first word  that two or three words isn't the issue  even even by uh even by the time that you were sending out those letters  yeah  james dickson did not have a cheque but you have a form for him   so a fairly large chunk of change  yeah  so who deposited it  but   because that would clearly be improper and that would have to suggest that something was amiss   yes but as i say i don't i don't  think that i even bothered or or concerned myself at that time about cheques because of this uhh uh the extension that we had already  i mean i knew the extension was in place and i knew that we had to send out uh uh there was this requirement by the securities comission to send out letters   uhm uh my recollection is i just wasn't very concerned  robert wasn't the primary title on the  rest of utterance   yeah i guess if i was i mean obviously if i look   as i look at it now and uhm and i woulda   would have and if i woulda would have  seen uhh tom and uh james who took a subscription form without a cheque that in my mind i would have said no you've gotta got to have a cheque  but i obviously did not never s  never even concerned me  i mean uh because of this extension period pause about ten seconds   now it was around that time that uh thomas  two words   yes  and i understand that the reason of his leaving was that he had wanted a more important role in management of the u s funds
