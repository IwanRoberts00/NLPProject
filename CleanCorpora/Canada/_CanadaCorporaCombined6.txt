 protesting a little too much   no n no it was a little bit too uh  rehearsed spiel on how great the speakers were   and how much and uh  mm hmm   right   then i couldn't get away from it you know i cou    oh my god   it was obviously a   good thing you didn't have any money on you  laugh words laugh   i was tempted for about a minute  yeah  and then i realized that it was a scam  yeah  and they drive around and they get people and uh try to sell them the thing and they would probably   yeah they probably do too  yeah yeah  they probably sell them  so   most people don't you know a lot of people probably don't question too much where these great fourteen hundred dollar speakers came from  well when he said they were fourteen hundred dollars apiece i thought wait a second  where does it you know  yeah   me and uh josh and i were actually  we were looking at apartments on the weekend and we went into this one place where the one of them was obviously a jazz like a musician and they had like all this jazz stu  stuff you know posters and things around and very expensive audio equipment and josh said this would be great for thieves you know  just spend a couple of days looking for apartments  you get to go around check out what people have you know   and in fact   but on on this part of town when you're looking at apartments they're usually empty these days around here  empty  aren't they  no   word the apart no  probably cos they're tryna trying to  sell them for july though   they're tryna trying to   rent them for july yeah   oh yeah   yeah  so you get to go out check out people's stuff and then you know  well it was a very very expensive piece of equipment they had and they weren't home  so   so maybe tape cuts out a couple of seconds?   i'm so   hey  so yeah we're yeah we're gonna  going to finance on you you know  actually two or three words   yes we found a place   and it's not a hundred percent sure but it's almost sure that we're in there   oh good where   words   it's on uh belgrave below sherbrooke  a bit it's on   it's one of those streets that's only below sherbooke  you know there's belgrave clifton regent and then melrose  okay  it's between hampton and melrose   oh yeah  anyway they're just they're just  below sherbrooke they don't continue above   and they're very nice   a are they like uh   like yours  they're one way kind of from   hmm  like like the same idea as what you've got now  no no no  what do you mean they're one way  they're one way streets so you'd go  they're quiet you know   word   oh okay   they're only between uhm de maisonneuve and sherbrooke so you have to go around and come back up  okay  and uh er they're mostly duplexes if they're  down towards de maisonneuve and the tracks there're a few kind of buildings and stuff but the upper part of the street is almost always duplexes  and it just happened in such a flukey way  we were uhm we rent we called around   we started looking thursday night like seriously you know and  we called around and we saw one dive on thursday  just oh just gross  words   word remember what it was like   what  word   oh it was just revolting  i mean we were we rang the bell we were  already running late and we laugh rang the bell and uhm   and these two laugh enormous dogs came barreling towards the door laugh jumping on us and like laugh  like they would eat the baby you know   right   and uhm there's a woman  this tiny little woman was struggling to control these huge dogs  she finally got the worst one of the two and locked it in the bathroom  and as we looked at the apartment word   in the bathroom of the apartment you were looking at  yes laugh   in the bathroom laugh the apartment we were looking at   and as we uhm as we looked at the place he was like  lungeing at the laugh door  and the other one was sort of kept  jumping up and tryna trying to bite dana 's foot or whatever  they were friendly but just those kind of crazy dogs  you know  out of control   and it was just it was a  place that had about two windows  the whole interior of the apartment was completely dark  no skylights no windows nothing  and uh just really you know those kind of places that have uhm  phone wire kind of painted and crusted to the baseboards laugh   laugh   you mean like here  like here yeah laugh but worse  yeah  and you know all the floors are scarred and the doors   are kind of they've been painted about fifty million times so they're about this thick and uhm   yeah and they look like they've been broken into a few times cos they  yeah  and just oh and the woman herself had been fixing up the place but it was one of those sort of jobs where the landlord says oh you can finish the basement if you want you know  laugh   and you're sort of thinking uh no thanks  words so it was two levels there  it was one uh we looked at the upper end of the  the lower but they were just that was just just hideous   and that's the one you got that they gave you   the one we got j was just  a fluke  it was ah a friend of a friend and we just happened to go to this woman's house and say we we stopped by to visit for a minute and we said you know do you know of any places around  we were with my mom and and she said do you know of anything around and and this woman said yeah when do you want it for i'm moving in july and my place is great  and we went to look at it and it is really nice  it's beautiful  sssssso so what kind of  word   it you know it's a six and a half  it's really big  it's got a deck in the back like  it's a it's the upper floor but they share the deck with the main floor the main   the people who live down there are nice  they have kids  oh okay   it backs onto an alley that's full of kids and really nice  you know like lots of nice families   two or three words backs  onto an alley that's full of rats  full of children playing   and uh it's really big it's got a beautiful bathroom with an old-fashioned tub and it's been but but it's been fixed up it's got new windows and   how would you compare it to the place you got now  oh tons better  i mean it's it's got some of the same things like stained glass windows and stuff but it's in much better shape  oh really  it sounds nice then   oh yeah   it's beautiful  and it's in a great spot  and uh m'i am i allowed to ask what it's worth  uh it's it's actually cheap  it's six sixty-five heated  wow  it's really cheap compared to some of the oth  we looked at one that was lovely but it was seven ninety  you know  yeah   where'd you see it  on regent  just off sherbrooke   oh yeah   cos i know uh uh jan and alexis are looking for a well a place  they looked at places that are i mean they only have the one well the one income and   i know   and they looked at places that are sort of eight nine hundred  they are closer to where we are  yeah yeah  well we looked at a lot in that area too but thing is  sigh it seems a lot farther away unless you drive all the   time   you know what i mean  yeah   and we don't necessarily we can't necessarily always do that so  i looked at a few that   yeah   yeah but like like where we are exactly where we are i think is is being  word   i i like sherbrooke  i like the street  mm hmm  cos when you walk down the street there's lots of things to poke around at   mm hmm   i i like where we are cos it's very uh very uh alive   lively   and that you can walk to all the uh you know all the services cos you've got the park i've got words    yeah yeah   we looked at some not exactly where you are but more like westbourne rosedale  and those streets  somehow didn't   yeah   but if you word too far  you ca it's i you feel    like i don't feel like i don't feel uhm i don't feel uh sorta sort of cut off because we're right on s on the main  road which has a bus or the uh thing   yeah   mm hmm yeah   yeah  you know it's easier not taking the car  yeah  but certainly if   but if you go a little deeper  yeah  like even if you go down to uhm you know on our street  or our type of street but closer to the park  closer to the   yeah  like fielding and chester kind of it's   it's not good to walk  no  it's kind of a depressed area around fielding  and south city and that cos it's that walk  through the uh  word   yeah   yeah   yeah   the other thing that i wasn't crazy about i mean i like your street and that with the houses on them but the the  streets we looked at with apartments they were all sort of modern  like sixties kind of apartments  oh yeah   really ugly   and they they they   had more of a feel of like apartment buildings even though they were only duplexes   because they had this sort of like uhm you know  that kind of flooring tile up the stairs and  yeah right   you know what i mean  like it was just it was more  apartmenty feeling  yeah   so   yeah   but the only thing is this place i mean the woman is  ninety-nine percent sure she's moving to colorado but if she flakes out on us at the last minute we're gonna going to be  uh upset yes  upset   but remember she had to give notice so she   she well she has   a ninety day a ninety day clause in her lease  and she's she's almost positive she's going  but it's just she tends to like to keep her options open a little bit and i kinda  kind of know her my mother sorta sort of   knows her  yeah   but we're pretty sure it's gonna going to work out  just the way it happened was sort of so n  destined you know   perfect   like the best way it happens   yeah  and it was perfect for us too the place  it's great  well it's funny how sometimes uh that kinda   kind of   i've always been optimistic especially  the type a of you know things that happen  yeah i am too   yeah   and uh usually just when you're at your  limit or when you think things are gonna  going to happen  something always happens   mm hmm   we we always we almost rented  this one that was seven ninety  it was a beautiful place but it was very uhm  it was expensive for us to pay that much  it was heated but still  heated   that's still a lot  to jump from five hundred to seven ninety is quite a  uh a jump  yeah   yeah   and it was also an apartment that was sort of almost too fancy for us in a way  like it was a bit of a kind of   like the people in there now are professors you know  and sorta sort of like   i dunno don't know it just didn't feel  you're a professor too  yeah  i know i'm a professor word but not that kind of professor you know  laugh   where where exactly was it  it was on regent just below sherbrooke  that's one west of melrose  and what was the other like  nice  the streets are nice  because they just it's just one block   i might uh   i might tell jan and alexis about that  cos i know that they're prepared to pay  i'm tryna trying to get them to buy
