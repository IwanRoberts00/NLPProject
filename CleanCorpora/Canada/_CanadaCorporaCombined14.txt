 it wasn't glue it was wax laugh isn't it  well yes but wax is a glue  yes alright   so when did you get the idea to do this  uhh when i was at the national gallery  when i looked over that uhhm balcony in the atrium there  and directly below me was a circular table with four chairs nicely designed  and i thought god i thought beautiful to  sp have a b body splayed out down there  uhh be about twenty feet i suppose  i guess that the im image   i find the image i particularly appealing and haunting    how did the black clothes look on the grey floor yesterday  yaaa i didn't think very much about the colour  no  no it's the film it's the film that    cos the colour plays such a i think important role in this one with the dandelions doesn't it  ehmm   ya ya ya it's interesting though the dandelions are  are featured in your wreath  hmm  and she reminds me of a greek maiden now that  an innocent greek maiden and uh she's not a tender person you know and at this stage very outgoing very aggressive and   but here all that vulnerability shows  ya it does  absolutely   hmm they are quite similar really when you look at them  ya they're ya ya   the greens and i think the colour's a little bit more vibrant and more maybe they're using different film  what do you think about rockney by the way  well everybody seemed to be dismayed that it was overgrown  uhm i presume because you've gone to it for years and seen it  lovingly cared for and manicured but i don't think i've been there before so it didn't bother me to see it uh grown over  but it was uhm untidy  but it was a lovely place and uh  i dislike it  why is that  well i grew up you know i was born less than half a mile from that rockery and into that sort of upper-middle-class environment surrounded by wealth and  you know sixty years later i returned to that place to look at it  and it reminds me of  you know i live very much in the present but on the other hand i'm forced back into the past sometimes when i go see that district  yes   oh look there's a child uhh i look there's a child and i  walk there and in the seats and i walk there a certain amount of happiness and all that was destroyed uhh in nineteen twenty-nine  so it's not an easy sort of saunter for me  it's a it's an unkinds  sported back in time and i don't really like that because i live very much today   so i don't like to go back in time unless i choose to do so myself  choose with a small c  do you think then about what sort of person you  would have been had the circumstances had  had stayed the same   cough   no absolutely not  no i don't two words things   it was about you know all the unhappiness came  which came after that period after words  that environment  didn't you say that that park was where johnny  had taken his tumble on the toboggan or was that a different  near that ya ya ya  well that was you know that's another generation after that you know   another life   ya another life another generation  ya must be strange for you word eh photograph a sister who is you know twenty-three years younger than you are  well it's always it was strangest   in the very very beginning when she was littler  but uh i i was glad yesterday when i went to the school and they said hey you look like joanne's sister  i enjoyed that  but uhm  what do you feel like having cough two sisters who are so much two half-sisters who are so much younger than you   well number one i've never stressed the half  part and you know that  it just strikes me as something that doesn't need to be stressed but of course how i feel about it is not a straightforward  sort of situation  i'm very grateful that we all get along  that uh their personalities are you know mesh with mine   and uh the bottom line for me has always been how much joy they bring into your life  so i would like them if only for that  uhm hum uhm hum uhm hum how do you feel about the separation  and and uh pending divorce  again that's very complex and words    well ya i know it's complex but you know come on how do you feel about it  there's no one sentence answer is what i'm saying   no but you've got words  you've got words of time  uhm i have a lot conflicting feelings about it  i obviously wish it wasn't happening  uhm i hope that we can all come through it with affection and strong ties  you know i'm not particularly concerned about that as far as uh my sisters are concerned  i'm a little more concerned about how it will affect you  but i feel a lot better after i guess the conversation the other morning uhm where you stressed you are living one day at a time and you do feel optimistic about the future and when the time is appropriate you'll consider new adventures but for this moment you're just uhm taking it a day at a time  phrase   yes i am  why  well i suppose it's the business of vows  laugh come on anne-marie   it's true there's uh the in sickness and in health  part there's the till death un   unless why bother being married  and that there are many choices to how you can be in a relationship  there's the common-law situations there's the more casual situations and there's marriage  and uhm the essential idea of marriage is a life-long commitment  so i i mean it's hard not to use melodramatic words like uhm like vows  and honour and uh that sort of thing but i appreciate that it wouldn't do anyone any good for you all to stay together if there's uh essential unhappiness  don't you understand her position at all  oh sure i'm very good at putting myself in other people's shoes  absolutely  but it's a i guess it's a question of the newness  getting getting used to uh the new parameters  no the you know words i just remember things  it's uh also a social contract  and if uh both parties agree you can uh you can break that contract  and where society's set up in a certain way and uh we have agreed we have laws which say if that contract becomes inoperable we can dissolve the contract according to certain rules and regulations and procedures  and uh it isn't for life it used to be for life and   word   why has it changed  well it's a very simple reason marriage was a sacrament ordained by god  i mean that is what uh why  marriage was uh you could not dissolve marriage   it was based upon a uh sacrament which could not be altered  you couldn't you can't change a sacrament  it was an absolute  we no longer believe that  and uh well uh i i'll tell you something interesting  i'm not angry  i beg your pardon that's not quite true  i'm angry at the way it was done but i'm not angry at the  the act itself okay  uhm i don't care  i care for the fact that the the family unit as we know it will no longer exist okay   but i'm not particularly surprised about it nor am i  the only thing i worry about is my health  i'll be absolutely honest  will my health at seventy years of age be okay so that i can discharge my responsibility with the kids  and that's the only normal i mean you know i am a poor man but i'm not worried about money   i'm simply not worried about it  i'm not trying to  can i provide an uh physically and psychologically and spiritually an environment where those kids will  thrive   and that's what my responsibility is  nothing else  well i guess i was when steve was over the other day uh he mentioned that his parents were having their fiftieth anniversary and i thought how unusual that was and i think i said something to you later about well heck the only people in our family that are gonna going to get to the twenty-five are gonna going to be chloe  and arnie   and uh well perhaps i should remember i don't see any trouble on the horizon for tom and sammy as well  but it is unusual to have that sort of uh length of marriage  it shakes up my ideas of of what people are capable of too to have your marriage again melodramatic terms fail  i mean it doesn't fail at all it changes uhm but i suppose i have conflicting feeling about that as well  i don't know if people can go a lifetime   it's a clash of romantic notions with more practical notions  particularly with the stresses that uh people face in this  time  well you know i'm word of things  cough which i've seen   i've seen over and over and over again and this may be having something to do with times in which we live where the one partner for whatever reason outlives the other  uhh there's a guy i know at word who's a full professor there and his wife put him through school for years and she was a secretary and uh he got his b a and his m a and his p h d and started publishing nationally and internationally and he outgrew his wife  cough she was still a little secretary you know pounding away on her word processing machine  suddenly couldn't communicate anymore   and i've seen the same thing with women uhh   i mean women who overcame a you know a  skilled position   and her husband was a carpenter   and he couldn't keep up with her anymore and she's wanted it out and she got out hmm  and it's not too dissimilar to the relationship i had with  kim   she's a very sophisticated woman living in in   in an expanding world and my world is contracting   so you know that part i understand too  that's quite apart from the physical aspects  but when you talk about outgrowing someone you're  it seems to me that you're mostly talking about intellect and world experience  there's much more to healthy relationships than just the sharing of ideas and the growing of the intellect  i it things  that keep us closest to someone often have little to do with those things i think  na you're ah you're talking about sex  uhh yes but more the feeling of being home when you're with a particular person  word see one of the things about  word feeling of relationships is that if you have a strong sexual bond you wis you can automatically resolve certain problems through sexuality  you reach a crisis ah you rejoin sexually and you start again and that's the essence of certain kinds of relationships  it's a very healing thing  it's a delight and it's a healing thing  we don't have that   as she coughs and chokes and sputters laugh   this is her father she's talking to  laugh ya   ya that doesn't actually surprise me i mean ah   it fifteen years is a long time to be with somebody and uhm  i remember kim saying to me when i separated from joe  oh you've got the seven year itch  uhm which in a very small way was true and that was more an entire crisis of identity in and uhm a terror of the emotional blandness that had crept into my relationship with him  but that's something i struggle with too i suppose the idea that infidelity does happen and how do you get beyond that i don't know  uhm how do you keep that feeling to one person physically at work for a long time i don't know  but it can't it can't be that it's not the it can't be the centre of it all
