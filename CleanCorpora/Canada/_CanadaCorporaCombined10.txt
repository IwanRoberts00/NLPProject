 okay now how many years have i been married   cough   like eight years almost now  okay   okay this house  like i've got a lot of stuff junk like stuff in there i never ever even use  right  one or two words didn't go into the dishwasher  so i'm more into stuff that will go into the dishwasher like these things  my mother for some strange reason decided that i didn't have enough cutlery like forks and knives  i dunno don't know where she gets this idea from  so in niagara falls clears throat new york i think or buff buffalo or e   new york  well it's either over the border but somewhere around niagara falls i mean ontario or or  new york there is an oneida factory outlet  right  my mother and her friend flew to this thing  now god knows why  my mother's got enough junk in that house to suit  yeah to to feed an army with it  spoons and forks and knives  anyways she feeds laugh she buys   a set of twenty-four spoons and forks and knives and  and word   twenty-four   yes like for twenty-four place settings  right  and then she sho and then  plus a whole bunch of other spoons that don't belong to this particular set because she has decided that she and laugh starts  i don't have enough laugh ends   and so she gives me half and and i'm telling her i don't want this  and she's i was there last time and you know   you were you were getting mad at dylan  for using the silver  like he goes into this drawer and he takes out this silver and  then he like clears throat insteada instead of  taking out like his spoons he wants to use all these little spoons and then he just shoves them down the sink  this is why i've been mad at him  not because he was using the silverware okay   i was getting mad at him because he was shoving these little teaspoons down the sink and then that caused you know plumbing problems right  so she gave she gives me this set of twelve  like i don't have what is that thing called where you put all you know it's where you put all your  forks and spoons and knives  like the little organizer that you put in your door   drawer   a few words   i don't have enough room for one of those these things  and if the drawer is just full now with laugh starts forks spoons knives pronounced 'knifes' and things  laugh ends   has she thanked you ah again for her present  uh uh  she didn't you don't think she  liked it  well i think she probably will like it eventually once she gets out of her word state  but have i told you this that she's now consulting uhm two  what do you call it financial advisors   advisors   two of them  not one laugh starts but two laugh ends   i thought that he made her  a a date  he did  he did  he made a date for her with the one guy  yeah  and she went to his office cos she had some problems about him coming to her house  mm hmm  and and uh she liked him   word word   word   she said that yeah he seemed to know what he was talking about  and i said oh mother that's their job they have  you know they get commissions from you when you transfer your r r s ps registered retirement and savings plan  over or whatever   mm hmm   and that he they're helping them buy mutual funds because they have that four or five words and all this crap  a few words   and so then she said yes yes yes and then i said well did you like him  did you get a good feeling from him  did he give you some good solid advice  and she said well clears throat yes yes yes you know i liked him and got a good feeling and he gave me good advice  and i'm going to see him again in two weeks once i get all of my uhm  i forgot one of her all of her  r r s ps registered retirement and savings plan and bonds and stock or i dunno don't know she doesn't have any stock word   she could make a list of them   word word   ya and when they're maturing and what rate she's getting  and all this so that you know she wants him to deal with them and she can start transferring them over so that she doesn't have a penalty on this or stuff   word   and then she's i said oh well that's good and then she said but then you know i'm also going to talk to this wood gundy investment firm man  and i said what for if you if you  feel laugh starts good about this other guy you know why laugh ends   and maybe i just wanna want to you know make sure that i know what i'm doing  so fine two or three words   so she's checking the first guy out  that's right  basically laugh starts a few words  thinking about word laugh ends   a few words he tells her the same  stuff  that's right laugh starts   and the first guy will get all her commission laugh ends   laugh   well that's really shrewd  i just hope that the two corroborate pronounced as a mix between 'co-operate' and 'corroborate' cos then she'll have to go to a third if the second guy a few words the first guy a few words has to go to a third she'll get really confused  oh god really laugh   laugh   yeah i know laugh   but then she'll phone me and she'll tell me whatever the problem is and then i'll give her my laugh starts two cents worth and then  she won't listen to anything i say  so she'll ask another word laugh ends  the same questions and he'll tell her the same thing laugh   and then she'll agree with him and go with whatever you know  she's been told before by him anyway so  i think i word   you're lucky she's working  if sh   oh god she would drive me crazy   if she'd been at home she'd be probably parked on your doorstep all the time  laugh   mm hmm   laugh starts as it is she's buying me cutlery laugh ends   you really   you really are quite lucky   yeah laugh   i know laugh   laugh starts i've got five years to deal with this  laugh ends   then what am i gonna going to do  mm  laugh   i don't know  but then maybe she'll get used to her situation by then  yeah   yeah she probably   well she has a lot of friends though you say  she does and uh she also uhm she you know  she likes going to uhm she likes going  back home and she's got all of her college friends  well  and you know some of them uhm are single now and  their kids are all grown up  and uhm every time she goes back she  you know they word have this reunion  they're always going to one another's houses for tea and dinner and   i know all her friends already and they come here to visit her and stuff like that so   she's she just sort of decided to do the uhm florida thing only over there  like six months of winter over there and six months here  yeah yeah yeah   nah  well it shouldn't be a problem unless she's got  oh yeah actually she might be uh she might be  going to burlington with bill   sigh super  sigh   hmmm  when did she mention that  i don't know  well then how do you know if she's going to burlington with  bill   well i don't know i she i think she   mentioned it or something  i'm not sure  i'm not sure  well what are you gonna going to   do with that place with that bed   well if worse comes to worse i'll rent a car and we'll go  don't make a big deal of it   no i'll ask fayed   i'll ask fayed to take us   no i'll rent i car and we will go  well that's ridiculous to spend thirty bucks to go buy a piece of furniture  that's absolutely out of the question   it's ridiculous  well even if we had asked fanny in the first place  we did   i know   but it doesn't matter even if we had made plans she would have changed them to go to burlington anyways   so   oh   oh you mean she's not reliable in that sense   no she's reliable but she's not gonna going to miss up a chance for a vacation in burlington just to bring us to ikea  oh yeah  i mean think about it tom would you  well if i made a commitment to somebody i would  so you possibly ho your only vacation your only time off to take somebody to ikea for one morning  no i i   would you   no you wouldn't   i know you wouldn't and neither would i  yeah but then i wouldn't promise them   and then   if i wasn't sure then i wouldn't promise the person  but this has just come up  hm   you can't depend on people these days  no you can't   and i you know what i wouldn't even insist on her doing it  if it comes to her having a vacation before bringing us to ikea she needs a vacation more than she needs to stick around here  no i know but you don't you don't say you can do something if you're not sure whether you can do it or not  okay   i know i never do that   i never promise anything  i never say yeah sure anytime anytime you know  i never say that  w'i well i know but that was before she had a chance to go to burlington  anyway i'm going to ask fayed if he can bring us  well  don't ask fayed until we see fanny tonight  anyway she might not be going to burlington cos she may not have any money so  tha that's more irish and french   canadian  it's that dancing and everything uhm   yes  yes yes yes  yeah   and i never learned irish dancing that  my father's side of the family's irish but i never learned  i never learned that  i think scottish country is wonderful  it is it's wonderf wonderful   it it was  it was great  i remember as a child i just loved it  and there was one dance you did called strip  the wheel and it's really fast and  word word  it's fun   yeah   and you could just see how kids would really like it   he teaches two undergraduate courses  mm hmm  and he's and they're two different undergraduate courses uhm one is physics for mathematics and then there's rel uhm quantum mechanics or something anyway  he's nice enough to photocopy his lecture notes and give it to them so that they can follow along as he  as he teaches whatever you know  mm hmm   uh hum   and you know his notes are for himself like he sits here  preparing them and then writes them all out by long hand and  they they went to his office they elected some class president or something who went to his office with a bunch of other committee members or something like student committee members and demanded  that he type up his own notes so that they can have  you know so that they can read them better  now donny's writing is is very good i mean it's it's not it's not at all sloppy  if you look at it it's very decipherable you know  but can you imagine that he's nice enough to give them photocopies of his own personal lecture notes and then they want him to type these notes up  when he told me this i just i said  you're not seriously considering doing that are you  it's a waste all your time   y you know  and he's word   so what did he do  i i think this happened last year  he said well he'd think about it and i don't think he's done anything yet because he hasn't taught last he didn't   he's not teaching this term  well tell them to get one of their own to type them up  mm well yeah that's right  why not  and pay for the photocopies too   sentence   he didn't even ask them to pay for photocopies he did   this from his grant   sentence   i just thought first of all i've bee   i have been to so many university   well that's what this is all about too is that the kids get passed on from you know grade one and two three four five and and they're just getting passed along and people don't  and the parents they don't think a lot like most parents aren't like you  laugh   a lot of parents are too busy  they don't have books at home they don't read to their kids  mm   uhm you know the television's on   and it seems to me that the kids who are the real whizzes with the computers and everything they're just they're just    it's it's getting to be a more and more of a spread i think between you know the kids that are  who have everything and the kids who can't cope
