 as you watch them brush those stones you see how they can really apply pressure  they get a lot of weight on that curved handle on that brush  and in such a position they can work a lot closer to the running surface of the rock  yes  you get a lot of pressure on it   now there's two corner guards up and heidi hanlon's asking kathy floyd once again to put a centre guard up   the danger here for kathy floyd is she not does not  want to come into the house don and put the rock on  high in the twelve-foot allowing b c to maybe hit and roll behind those corner guards   and they have not laid a brush to it   a lot of curlers might say well listen why doesn't she ignore the centre guard and go around the corner guard  which isn't a bad call but i think judy jul uh  julie just gonna going to play it very conservative here   run the centre one off  hope maybe that uh they come into the rings uh with a new brunswick draw and maybe hit and roll behind protection   it's around the seventh end for a curler that you start looking in a close game you start looking at  the the end you're in and you feel like you're running out of time sometimes to make your move   well to me the strategy has worked for heidi hanlon because now there is a centre guard and there's no question that she's   gonna going to go around it and  that's what she's waiting for  she sure will   heidi hanlon now going on the attack  jodi had to roll her shooter off that centre line and unfortunately she didn't  so now heidi hanlon's gonna going to  take advantage of it   heidi hanlon in her first appearance at the scott tournament of hearts in lethbridge in nineteen eighty-seven finished with a record of four and seven in nineteen eighty-nine in kelowna she finished at seven and four and in ottawa five and six during round robin play  you mean there's hope for me for next year  laugh you've only been there seven times colleen   your record is getting worse   you'd think i would learn  oh well thank you laugh   laugh   that's not quite a disaster for new brunswick  she still has her rocks out front  it poses a little bit of a problem for julie sutton  i think now uh   i really think julie's gotta got to go in  sh i i agree with you because she can't clear everything  no   even if she does clear it and make a great double peel and roll heidi's gonna going to go around one of those corners  i don't know whether she'd go around the corner but uh there may be one around that centre line that hang around after this  well i'm saying that she makes the double peel and roll and leaves nothing in the centre   she removed the yellow-handled stone but there is still  that centre rock to hide behind   you know it's your third's last rock you're one down  there's four guards up i think maybe you do a bit of a gamble and uh draw in around those as opposed to hitting them like julie sutton   at the risk of offending all the female curlers who are listening today are not men more inclined to gamble in these situations  i think maybe a little bit but uh you know all week here uh a lot of the women curlers did a lot of gambling   i mean you haven't you have not seen many strategic errors in this game   i mean they're almost flawless  the strategy has become so improved and it's thanks to television coverage with wireless mikes being able to listen to the skips saying what they are gonna going to be doing   there is the odd exception  some nova scotia teams really have trouble describing  thank you  thank you again you guys said very sarcastically   look at this   okay   that's the shot she wanted  this is the sh reason i think julie sutton should have gone in  it allowed the opportunity for heidi hanlon to put a perfect rock in there and that's exactly what she's done  it's in around the guard it's in front of the tee-line   you cannot have draw to it because it's in front of the tee-line you have to make contact with it   aren't there times when you're in those predicaments that you have to be the first one in  oh sure there is a time that you have to say well okay forget about defense let's go and get a little bit of offense into our game and get around the guards before the other team does   i mean heidi's called a near-perfect game so far   but julie sutton has a very good shot here  if she can make hit what she can see she may roll over to the left-hand side don around that corner guard   she has to save her shooter   oh boy   so now i think heidi hanlon will try and place a stone in exactly the same position   you know we heard uhm heidi during the fifth end break saying she thought she had a cutter and you've gotta got to  wonder if that yellow rock is cutting a lot harder than the  uh than the red  well she alluded to the fact that she thought heather houston had a problem with the yellow-handled stones last night   well for heidi hanlon she has an opportunity now to really put a lotta lot of pressure on julie sutton  she would like exactly the same rock maybe a foot deeper don to force british columbia julie sutton to make a very difficult draw with no backing   but i think she'd like to pull this in about another foot deeper into the four-foot but in front of the tee-line  not never ever behind it   you hear heidi yelling just for room lot  oh she's got a great-looking shot  aw this is just a beautiful-looking shot  now they're gonna going to take it into the four play  tight to the four play   look at that   ah if you picked it up put it in your pocket carried it all the way down the ice that would be the spot to put it   that's about as fine a draw as you'll see   now do you remember the fifth end when julie sutton played a draw against one and she put it right on the button   that's exactly what she's trying to duplicate   the only difference is that this time she has to be on the button laugh   the last time she could've afforded you know a  a little lighter   but she's remembering that draw same as before   and this is one where the sweepers play such an important role  oh  karri wilms and melissa soligo on that stone immediately  they con they control the rock   they're they're just keeping it clean  she has a ton of weight here   oh boy   there is nothing to rest against  she has to stop   aw she just slips to the back twelve-foot   and that enables new brunswick to steal two on the seventh end   so new brunswick has now taken control  new brunswick leads by a score of five two after seven ends  sports wrap-up show   it took seven ends before either side in this scott tournament of hearts was able to score more than a single point and it was a steal of two by heidi hanlon of new brunswick on the seventh end that has moved the new brunswick champions into a five two lead   and right now new brunswick is intent on really hitting everything in sight   and all the stones roll out of the rings   heidi hanlon was very busy on that rock  she was over to the side boards making sure the one touched then she uh had to go back and uh sweep her rock out of play   it's hanging on in the back but it's not in the house don and that rock could prove beneficial to b c as the end progresses but for now b c is gonna going to  try and throw up some uh put up some corner guards hoping of course that new brunswick either hits it on the nose or misses it completely  they have to get something started  they have to get a couple of rocks buried behind corner guards  and that's the way you score two points   the other way of course is of freezing the one that's not in the rings but just at the back of the house   and very quickly heidi hanlon moves out to ask for the removal of that b c stone from her second sherri stewart   a three   sherri stewart still curling at eighty-eight percent   laugh ah boy when you're hot you're hot   that stone rolled through and removed that rock that was hanging at the back out of play in behind the twelve-foot circle   don you know interesting enough out of the twelve skips  uh percentage-wise in the round robin uh playoff heidi hanlon was eighth  out of the twelve skips uh with uh sixty-two percent whereby julie sutton was number one with seventy-five percent yet their percentages are turned around here   heidi hanlon's curling eighty-four and julie sutton's only curling sixty-three  and i should also point out that we've been teasing colleen jones a lot this afternoon but she was a solid seventy-one percent  ah what's the old saying it's not my fault   laugh   laugh   laugh   colleen i thought you curled beautifully  now what do you two fashion connoisseurs think of the new look for the uh curlers   yes  being the fashion police that you are perhaps you've noticed that they aren't wearing bulky sweaters anymore and polyester pants  it's a very european look  well in the past at world championships we have seen the european rinks show up in this type of uniform uh a track suit type of uh uniform   i think most of the competitive curlers feel that they are very comfortable but there have been some curling associations that have complained about the provincial identification that one has associated in the past with the colour   as a competitor how did you feel about them  oh i liked them  i thought they were a new fresh look  they were comfortable to play in   british columbia here they can't get too discouraged about being down three because you know there's still lots of time  i just hearken back to my round robin game against heidi  we were down three playing the tenth end and scored three  wound up losing it in an extra end but uhm scoring three is not impossible   and that's the task now facing julie sutton   she trails by three with three ends remaining   the key for the skip for british columbia now is to remain focused and not to get discouraged which is a tough thing to do  well especially when you're down three points but you're right  she has to try and score two here  if she scores two she's right back in this game  this might be a break for her if it hangs in but it   a lot of rotation on that rock so it's gonna  going to spin right out of the rings  as you said earlier don when things are going well they  just seem to multiply and for heidi hanlon all three stones roll out of play  well that's right  if they hit that a little bit thinner that rock may have stayed in at the back and uh b c would be drawing for two but uh everything seems to be going new brunswick's way right at this st  point  you know new brunswick's heidi hanlon was telling me earlier in the week that they have felt like a team of destiny and that they feel that these things are almost as much fate as anything else   also helps if you have got four-foot draw weight laugh  yes that's true but i think uh i think  maybe if uh you reflect back on uhm this game and if new brunswick goes on to win this game i think julie sutton uh may think about that first draw of hers
