 some cases what happened the wild people did break in and they subdued the village and they stayed and they took it over and they became kings   and when they did the village changed   the village before had been inward-looking protective  defensive distrustful of strangers but the kings who come to the  ci city to the village  the warriors they organize the people  they make them do things they wouldn't have done by themselves before  they build canals  they build roads  they reach out  they carry trade  they build empires   what they build is the city and the city's a different kind of an animal from the village   very different indeed  the city is outward-looking   the people of the city don't look at themselves  they look out to the rest of the world when they're expanding and viewing   and because they're growing fast and because they're aggressive and because they're adventurous the city has to pull in people all the time new people immigrants   and because it's always pulling in new people it has to be tolerant cos those people are going to be different  it has to accept them   compare that with the village  the village people inward-looking defensive don't like strangers protective   they want to preserve their culture   the city mentality outward-looking aggressive tolerant varied a mixture of people  you'll still find that today  i lived for three years in prince edward island  it's the biggest village in canada   you can go to prince edward island for two weeks  that's okay  you go there to live there they'll never accept you  they'll never trust you because you're from away   they only trust you if you were born there   you leave montreal you go and live in any small village you'll soon find you're not accepted cos you're different  cos in the village they all look like each other  they all talk like each other  they all go to the same church  they all have same ideas   they don't like anybody who's different   city though we are all different   just look around this room   we're a very mixed group  we look differently from each other  some of us talk different languages  we have different values   and we can all sit together as we couldn't in a village because in the city we have to accept each other   if you look at the history of montreal you'll find on the first day the city was founded back in sixteen forty-two  and i hope i got that date right cos i have a terrible time with it  sixteen forty-two i'm sure  they landed about a hundred and some odd people on the water bank right near gibbys restaurant and they celebrated a mass  and you know what the priest at that mass said  he said the most amazing thing   here he's got these people thousands of miles from france   they're in the middle of a wilderness   they're surrounded by hostile indians  if i were giving the sermon i'd say you are here to huddle together and protect each other   this is gonna going to be a rough go  that's not what he said   he said you are a grain of mustard seed whose branches will reach out to cover the earth drawn upon the parable of the mustard seed, matt. 13   think of that   you are a grain of mustard seed you're here to reach out   and the city was planted here not so you could huddle together  it's here because this is where the ottawa and the st. laurence rivers join and from here you can reach into the interior reach out for trade and expand across the continent   compare that to quebec city   quebec city up on a mountain top with walls around where strangers can't get in cough   quebec represents essentially a village mentality  montreal is something a different animal   it's a city   because of its history you find that when north america was explored by the french the explorers usually set out from montreal  this was the place that reached out   and the industry that developed in canada the railway that was built across canada the banks that were built across canada started in montreal  and in fact montreal reached out so far that at one time montreal built the railways of africa   most of them built by sir percy girouard   street's named after his father who didn't do anything   he was lawyer audience laughs   montrealers built the railways of brazil  montrealers built railways in china   montreal was the centre of ocean shipping empire the montreal steamship company  you still see their office down in old montreal   you know a funny thing if you look at the history of elections in quebec you will normally see that montreal has voted differently from the rest of the province   you usually find the same thing word with any big city toronto new york   it's very a very similar pattern   the big city normally votes differently from the rest of its region  think back if you can to all the duplessis years in quebec   when maurice duplessis was premier leader of the union nationale former provincial political party his votes didn't come from here  he got very few votes here  his votes came from the rest of the province   if you look at the parti quebecois  provincial political party look where its votes come  came from  for the most part they did not come from montreal  they came from the rest of the province  look at the results of the referendum   montreal was decidedly no   it was parts of the rest of the province that voted yes  that difference has always been there and it's there it's there because a big city is a different kind of an animal  it has different needs  it has different attitudes  but big cities generally are the prisioners of the political region they're in and you're prisoners of the political agenda of the region   and the region is normally dominated by what i call the village mentality the defensive protective mentality  look at the program of the separatists protect preserve  prevent change   these are all aspects of the village outlook and they're all death to the big city   a big city cannot afford to make its all of its   people conform to make them all the same   it can't afford to be intolerant to difference   but the big cities are prisoners of the larger regions they find themselves in   we are not the first people to notice this   this has been noticed in europe  and in germany for example large cities are given their own constitutional status   they're given their own constitutional powers   they still remain part of the country  they still remain part of the larger region they're in but they have their own powers because their needs are different   you are not going unite the french and english and the ethnics of montreal on separation   you are not going to unite them simply on confederation but  there is a very strong possibility you can unite them on the question of montreal having its own special status in the constitution and its own powers  and its own freedom to develop as it wishes to  and i think that is probably the most useful route that we can explore in the near future audience applause   it is a pleasure for me too because word  thought people who would who are intrinsically motivated won't be asking me what is this on the exam  this is much more fun  just as a as a guideline how many of you already have a business  how many of you are already started or part owner  of a business  okay quite a quite a few  good  okay  and then uh how many are uhm  o ob obviously there must be one word that's started or at least explored the idea of of starting a business  so uhm let's let's get started  uh just to update what elizabeth said about me uh   the flor the florist business i had ten years ago is it still pays dividends in the long run because now uh uh last week a buddy of mine who i met when i had the florist  ten years ago he called from uh miami  he's now in miami and he's now the associate of worldwide flowers and they want to have a distributorship in montreal  so i gave that to my son  which is what registered yesterday  thirty-one dollars  it's gone up a buck  and now he's in business for himself  and the beauty is he's just turned eighteen so he's entitled to about six thousand dollars in grants and he's entitled to about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars in in small business loans backed by the government  at eighteen years old  uh and on my side in my consulting business has word  contacts and associations  i'm now uh launching next year into ah a full-time consultancy because of s a p a large german uh client server who's doing large applications of software into major companies  now they need a change of management methodology  so i have to create for them thirty-one courses a whole curriculum uh hire trainers uh and instruct so on and so forth  so laugh it grows  it grows  it's all part of networking  some of the reasons why you might want to start opening  your own business while naturally in the future nobody wants to hire full-time employees anymore  uh everybody's trying to hold their job  you've got downsizing  and if you can save your job in one company or move to another you have the same problems associated there  entrepreneurialship is a winning situation  it's a winning situation for a company because when they have  word employee they no longer have to pay the benefits  on the other side laugh when you get your salary you're taxed at source  so if you make fifty thousand dollars typically you may be taxed at about fifty percent so come home with twenty-five thousand thirty thousand dollars  if you make the same fifty thousand dollars in business for yourself you usually come home with about fifty thousand dollars because you're in ineligible for the tax write-offs that you aren't eligible for as an employee  so there are advantages to being in business for yourself   another thing to establish at the start is that if there are any questions i won't wait till the end to ask are any questions  as an idea comes to your mind or if we're doing something and you want clarification don't hesitate to ask a question cos oftentimes many others are thinking the same thing  and so i don't mind answering questions on an ongoing basis  so anytime something comes just uh raise your hand and i'll be happy to answer  uh another thing that is driving small business is uh technology  uh the technology changes today allow for an entrepreneur to be sitting in their basement at home with as much firepower as  word the major corporations  nobody knows how big you are in your basement  and you're two words as your comfort   your business cards your brochures your handbooks and otherwise they don't see you  and so you you're able to fax  you're able to uh email  you're able to have the same information firepower as a major corporation working out of your basement for around five thousand bucks  so it's not ah ah it's not a difficult thing to do anymore  in other words you're able to have as much resources as large corporations   again the non-full-time workforce has grown by fifty-seven percent since nineteen eighty  word going are the nine-to-five workday long time jobs predictable about three words relationships corporate culture word security blankets the  word itself  they're all being replaced with cybernetics workspace  in other words a virtual corporation which already exists  one of the companies i'm working for now is a virtual corporation  there is no building laugh   everybody communicates via email lotus notes  and they're everywhere   monday one's in philadelphia one's in brazil and they communicate via email lotus notes and so on  a few word have to have meetings together but there is no building  you don't go to work so to speak  how many of you go to work nine to five   whoa  okay well that's that's going by the wayside  time shavers as it's called people who go in at nine leave at five everyday five days a week
