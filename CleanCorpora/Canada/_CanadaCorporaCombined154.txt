 for that reason uhm part of the youth internship approach is industry driven and involves the sectors of automotive repair logistics environment electrical manufacturing horticulture and tourism  aboriginal youth will benefit from the youth internship acquiring hands-on knowledge and skills required in today's workforce  the success of all our young people as they step into the adult world is crucial not only for their own self-esteem but also for the well-being and prosperity of society as a whole  the government stay-in-school aboriginal campaign is using innovative methods to increase public awareness and spur community action to reverse the appalling trend of having young people fall i guess basically drop out of school to the tune of ninety-five per cent in some areas as i've indicated  a lot of discussion that preceded these amendments to the young offenders act focused on violent crime and a need to get tough with young criminals but let's not lose sight of the fact that less than twenty per cent of the youth crimes are violent acts  m most they of course they get most of the attention because it's very unfortunate and uh it's uh it's very negative  that's what usually gets a lot of the ink and a lot of the air time  but let's not lose fact of the sight of the fact  that twenty percent less than twenty per cent   are violent acts  most most youth crimes are property and alcohol related  getting tough and throwing these young people behind bars is not the best anch answer in these situations necessarily  we're not saying that leniency is the answer  we're saying that perhaps there're other ways of forging relationships and partnerships that will help to reconstruct and rebuild communities  we as parents as well madam speaker have a responsibility  when a child is born and when a young child leaves the house to go to kindergarten you have no idea what that child will turn out but if you as a responsible member of the community don't do your level best don't do everything in your power to provide for that child the nurturing the love the guidance there's there really is almost a guarantee that you're sealing the fate of that person to a life of negativity  and uh and great downfall  even if you do everything right madam speaker there is no guarantee  if you don't do anything to help young people you're almost sealing their fate to a life that's really not very positive  so i encourage communities madam speaker i encourage all the people that affect young people  it takes one person in your life to have a positive impact on you  it could be a counsellor  it could be an r c m p royal canadian mounted police  officer  it could be a teacher  it could be a kindergarten teacher  it could be a friend an aunt or an uncle  somebody to reach out to a young person and to encourage and to be there madam speaker is what it takes sometimes  so i'd like to encourage people at the community level  remember that the responsibility is not just in legislation or amendments  the responsibility is the relationship we forge together as members of this country a wonderful country members of our communities wonderful and diverse communities that contribute to making life better for everyone  we have a responsibility for the future of this country and the future of this country is basically going to be drawn out through the young people that we nurture that we guide that we teach and that we leave uh the that we that the government and all of the governance that we leave behind us is in their hands is for them  we have that responsibility madam speaker  we have an onerous responsibility but if we do nothing i think that we will in this sense reap nothing  and i appeal to all of the people across the country to remember that laws are guides  they guide us  and we we work in the highest uh institution or court in this land and we are building laws and   and remaking laws and changing laws but we can't legislate caring and loving and nurturing the things that the countries have to give to ensure that the young offenders uh the situation with the young offenders is  bated uh abated   madam speaker thank you very much applause   questions and comments  the honourable member for peace river  thank you madam uh speaker   uh a question for the secretary of state  uh she's talked about a crackdown uh in this legislation that's coming forward and i certainly would like to know what uh type of crackdown is being proposed  and i know that my constituent who has written me a letter mister  paulsen who talks about the need for tougher  uhm tougher penalties  this gentleman is a grandfather who uh  his  he he says his two grandsons are repeat offenders and all they get is a slap on the wrist and he's uh   he's even scared to leave his home because he's been robbed by these two grandsons in the past  and i want to know what kind of crackdown you're speaking about here  these i know that you  you've suggested that only twenty-five per cent of the acts  are uhm are are violent but uhm i would put these in that violent class that the there there's  robberies involved  and uhm can you explain to to us and uh particularly to uh concerned canadians what type of crackdowns you're proposing  the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  uh madam speaker uh directly from the n   news release of the minister of justice uh who tabled the amendments on the young offenders the highlights of the bill include increased sentences for teenagers convicted of first or second degree murder in youth court to ten and seven years respectively dealing with sixteen and seventeen year olds charged with serious personal injury offences in adult court unless they can show a judge that public protection and rehabilitation can both be achieved through youth court extending the time that sixteen and seventeen year old young offenders who have been convicted of murder in an adult court must serve before they can be considered for parole  impro improved measures for information sharing between professionals like school officials and police with selected members of the public when public safety is at risk as well as retaining the record of serious young offenders provisions that will encourage rehabilitation and treatment of young offenders in the community when this is appropriate  madam speaker this does nos not  necessarily speak to the question that the member asked but i do believe over  in in the various communities that will be affected by this legislation and in the various provinces and territories there are people who the justice ministers uh on the provincial and territorial levels who are looking at attempts to better deal with young offenders in their own regions in their provinces  and what some of those attempts would be like having i guess community service work uh  and one suggestion that's proved quite viable in the aboriginal community that i might share with you is this  it has found that when when young offenders have been sent out on the land to do physical labour hard labour in camps where they've had to cut wood and haul water and do a lot of very physical work that the recidiv the recidivism  rate with those young offenders is virtually nil  that's not necessarily boot camp  they learn something  they learn how to survive  they learn coping sk coping skills   they regain their self-esteem  but those are the kind of ideas that are being entertained out there and i don't find them totally offensive madam s   madam speaker if they're coupled with other positive rehabilitative measures   french introduction   french, 4 minutes 20 seconds   the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  thank you madam speaker  uhm i'm i'm not sure that i would ever be capable of convincing the honourable member that anything the federal government does uh is going to be uh believable by him but madam speaker i'm sure that he'll recognize that since we've been in government that there has been a boost in the economy  we've created a hundred and eighty-three thousand jobs since we were elected  sixty-six thousand of those jobs have gone into quebec  uhm we've just had the signing of the infrastructure program recently madam speaker  our youth initiative is an initial first step madam speaker  we believe that uhm uhm that this is one way to uh stimulate uhm ah a very downtrodden and a very cynical group of young people who have been marginalized that we had to do something  we don't feel that in the five and half months we had that we have enough time to do all of the things that we should do  talk about consultation madam speaker  uhm this is a a a party who ah didn't agree with us interfering jurisdictionally by bringing forward this program  we had nothing but headaches and heartaches from them  now they want into the program  i'm glad  any time that the honourable member wants to put forward a proposal i would be more than happy to receive it  i would be happy to meet with him madam speaker outside of this chambers to discuss this program  i would be happy also to discuss all of the other programs we have because we have other programs  uh the government knows the opposition members know that we have a very difficult time  we're streamlining and we are uh restructuring and in some cases collapsing boards and uh getting rid of programs that would reduplicate or that would be duplicating other services  we're doing that and if it allows us to reallocate for other purposes which are positive which is what resulted in the youth service corps  we managed to maintain a level of service that's adequate for the public  i don't really know what the honourable member is complaining about but i'm certainly willing to work with him on in  in the future on all of these initiatives   french introduction   french, 2 minutes   and very briefly the honourable secretary of state for  training and youth   madam speaker this whole issue of young offenders is not an either-or  we are attempting to create a balance within the justice system especially as uh it pertains to young offenders  we're looking at some rehabilitative measures  we're not going to uh uhm you know uh lock up young people and throw away the key  we know that the costs for incarceration are prohibitive  i should know madam speaker in my riding and along with kenora-rainy river uh the honourable member uh from kenora-rainy river will attest to that we have the highest rate of recidivism of repeaters  we know what it costs to have peop people  incarcerated for long periods of time  the upkeep the costs are prohibitive  we know that so what we are attempting to do with the young offenders and so is the minister of justice is to attempt to create a balance to address the issues of violent crimes committed by young offenders and still maintain a section for rehabilitation  and as i indicated that the department of justice is not the only department that that has that responsibility  communities parents regions provinces as well as  uh uh as well as the honourable members in the house here have a responsibility to contribute in a positive way   point of order  point of order   the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby  uh thank you uh madam speaker  i'm wondering if i may have the unanimous consent of the house to ask uh just one brief question of my colleague audience responds " agreed"   do we does the honourable member have the unanimous consent of the house   a allow the question  the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby  thank you madam speaker  uh can my colleague advise this house on behalf of the government do aboriginal young offenders need special attention for those likely to receive a custody sentence
