 the oxford dictionary speaks of illustrious warriors of men admired for their achievements and noble qualities   searching for a female-centred definition i turned to vogue magazine  crowd laugher   i always tell my students i read vogue for the articles  crowd laugher   in any event vogue magazine described heroines as infinitely alluring a shade tragic crowd laugher   damsels in distress locked in castle turrets loom immediately before your eyes  i was rescued somewhat by the publication of feminist dictionaries over the last several years and the several that i cited poke fun at  hero   my favourite was a recitation from charlotte perkins gilman who was a very famous american feminist at the turn of the century who wrote as follows  this is her definition of hero   quotation   and i realized why we elected brian mulroney canadian prime minister crowd laugher   now cough what's most interesting to me about the feminist dictionary is that it contained no entry for heroine    presumably some feminists have concluded that the female counterpart of this hero is unsalvageable that it is seriously infected with saccharine femininity race and class privilege and the glorification of characteristics prized by men  with this perspective i sympathize but i respect   respectfully wish to disagree  i have always been partial to the reclamation of words and i think there is room to rehabilitate the word heroine  altered to give new meaning and dimension to the concept  it is not beyond the realm of possibility to believe that the feminist movement could forge an entirely new definition for  heroine one much richer fuller and more reflective of the diversity of women's lives  i think we need to grope toward something which will capture the lives of women who represent strength courage persistence  fortitude all of those in the face of oppression  and i think there're two main premises behind the reclamation task  let me just write this  i know you need a focal point at this point   the first direction we have to move sound of writing on a blackboard is the concept of inclusivity  our understanding of the levels of oppression have to be as inclusive as possible so that we ensure that race class and sexual orientation and so on are considered as well as gender  secondly sound of writing on a blackboard   secondly i think we have to grapple with the male traditions which tout heroes as role models and as perfect  i think we have to move beyond perfection   and i think we need to ask ourselves is perfection what feminists want to demand of their foresisters  is perfection a necessary ingredient of female heroism   let me start with the first inclusivity   much of our current feminist historical scholarship has focused upon white well-educated middle and upper class protestant women  for this i have to claim i share some responsibility  i'm clearly implicated in terms of the women that i began choosing to study  in my defence and the defence of the rest of us i can say that their records tend to be more accessible and their achievements have tended to reflect in some measure the criteria that wider society has viewed as heroic   but it seems to me that the search for women who represent strength and courage and persistence and fortitude in the face of oppression should be much wider   and the realization of this was painfully brought home to me  when i began working on my manuscript which will be appearing this spring titled petticoats and prejudice  i know this is the second time the title's been mentioned  i'm shamelessly flaunting my book   this is based on about a decade's worth of research i've done on nineteenth century legal records  and they reveal a remarkably diverse bunch of women improperly married wives victims of seduction and rape perpetrators of infanticide and abortion practising prostitutes petitioners for divorce and child custody and wage labourers  none of these women are warriors active in military manoeuvres  furthermore the admiration they achieved from a paternalistic society was grudgingly qualified at best   nor were they fainting damsels rescued by handsome knights   and yet there's undeniable heroism in the lives of women such as the following  ellen rogers was a francophone rape victim who demanded that women of all classes and sexual background should be protected from sexual assault  she spoke those words through tears in a toronto courtroom in eighteen fifty-nine to a courtroom filled with jeering and abusive public members who were laughing and shouting as her gang rapists were acquitted  esther r scott was an english prostitute who ran a notorious brothel in london ontario in the eighteen eighties  the crown attorney and the mayor of london decided to conduct a legal vendetta against her to make an example of her  she hired  she was a well-to-do brothel operator  she hired the leading criminal lawyers in the country a raft of them  about four by the time she finished  and she fought them at every turn of the way  and when she achieved success in her criminal case she turned around and authorized her lawyers to sue the crown attorney and mayor of london for compensation for false imprisonment  she won at the first level of hearings  subsequently the ruling was overturned but before they could catch up with her to jail her she had fled to the united states  and she returned to london approximately a decade later flush with prosperity with a new husband in tow who was described as a horse breeder and horse dealer to live out her life in financial security and middle class respectability in london ontario   euphemia rabbit was a woman from the first nations who also had italian ancestry who shot and killed her would-be rapist at slate creek british columbia in eighteen ninety-seven and she successfully argued self-defence at her murder trial   anna ballo a finnish immigrant committed infanticide in nanaimo in eighteen ninety-six in the face of stark poverty and social ostracism and then withstood the dramatic legal intervention into her life with stoicism and fortitude   nellie armstrong was a feisty smart-mouthed hot-tempered new brunswicker who fought unsuccessfully in eighteen ninety-five to wrest custody of her four year old daughter and two year old son from a violent husband  these women and others are ones whose histories should also be reclaimed and who also deserve the accolation heroine   next moving to perfection beyond perfection  male heroes male heroes have traditionally been catapulted into service for furnishing role models for the current generation and women have borrowed this pattern and heroines have been forced into moulds as gurus touted as unblemished symbols of wisdom insight and inspiration  my colleague rob martin has charged me with inculcating adulation of clara brett martin publicly  i think fairly in some measure  fairly   and i think the time is overdue for us to re-examine the search for perfection and consider whether it is essential or fundamental to our emerging new concept of heroine  these women did not ask to become our shining knights in armour   most of them would be horrified to know to what degree their thoughts and deeds would be scrutinized by future generations  out of a feminist sense of charity perhaps we ought not to require women of the past to bear responsibility of icons of the future a role they never sought   femininism might want to work towards embodying a more humble sense of human error a more grounded set of expectations about human failings and deficiencies  we come by this naturally  no one who has worked within the feminist movement for any length of time can claim innocence on this score   one of the gravest tasks facing our society today is to work towards an elimination of continuing and vicious anti-semitism racism ableism and other forms of discrimination   one of the chief barriers is the inability of members of the privileged groups in our society to admit their complicity  the knee-jerk reactions of defensiveness which sprouts almost immediately upon any assertion of sexism and racism is eloquent testimony to our wish to erase even the most polite dialogue on these issues   one way we might speed the work against these barriers is to look to our past to dissect the racism sexism and other forms of discrimination of our ancestors to do this honestly and without attempting to distance ourselves artificially from their errors   clara brett martin's failure to make feminism inclusive of all women's interests is centrally important to any full analysis of her place in history  i think we can learn from her errors because in so many ways her errors are our errors and this whole debate is about ourselves and the future  we can use the revelations about clara brett martin's anti-semitism as a spur to produce more research on the history of anti-semitism and its current manifestations on our profession and society  we can make clara brett martin's mistakes work to our heightened appreciation of justice fairness and equality  we can turn her lack of insight into a mechanism for remedial action today  clara brett martin's principles and actions were marred by bigotry and limited perspective but she did fight against some forms of male injustice  she challenged a part of the patriarchal system and she paid personally for her daring  demanding that she be perfect that she have understood every aspect of bigotry and injustice is to hold her to a model which will be met by very few perhaps none   that vision of heroine as perfect and omniscient is binding restrictive and remarkably rigid  if we hold to it we will consign ourselves to a future in which historians will write of theory and institutions but not of people  i for one would rather historians continue to write about individual women detailing at length their shortcomings and yet according them the respect of recognizing that at points there were bonds of shared sisterhood  clara brett martin is revealed as a women as a woman with significant gaps in her understanding of injustice and discrimination  i think we need to ask ourselves whether there is still room for her within this evolving rehabilitated concept of heroine  and i want to close with a poem by adrienne rich called a wild patience has taken me this far  quotation   thank you applause   a friend of mine returned from the two words  describing this bizarre geography book called gender and sexuality  after tracking down and reading peter jackson's maps of meaning i realized that it is an unusual book because it stretches the traditional boundaries of the discipline of geography word inclusion of issues of class race and gender   i mean what can possibly be geograph  geographical about such intimate personal subjects as gender and sexuality   as a feminist and as a new geography p h d student i was immediately intrigued by the potential of the common terrain between feminism and geography but when i tried to investigate word  field it proved to be problematic   whether discussed in mainstream geography journals or in traditional geographic circles i soon discovered that feminist geography is marginalized and obscure little known by geographers and even less known by feminists  in this paper i will briefly review the study of women in geography and gender and i will explore some reasons behind the neglect of this important body of work by mainstream geography   this question of geography's word  feminists is important because as marianne withers argues  when word the explicit study of the geography of women geographers have implicitly accepted the existing structure of society and prevented the examination of one of the most persistent and  pervas pervasive forms of inequality in our society    women were word from geography up until very recent times  it was only in the mid-nineteen seventies in britain and in the united states that a small group of not surprisingly female geographers became concerned with the neglect of women in the discipline   they set themselves the monstrous task of retrieving   retrieving the word from obscurity as they believed that the study of women's lives and spatial behaviour was of equal importance to the study of men's and that the distinctiveness  two or three words of women's experiences should be recognized  this original research which focused exclusively on how women adapted to their spatial activities became known as the geography of women   it directly challenged traditional geo  geographical work which one focused solely on males despite the  use of gender neut neutral   word two treated both males and females as one homogenous category or three implicitly assumed that men's lives were the norms a standard a standard against which women's lives can be compared
