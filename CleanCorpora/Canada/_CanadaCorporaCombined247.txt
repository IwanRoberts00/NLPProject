 sarah said she screamed and yelled   both roger and peter attempted to have oral sex with her and of course she refused   she said when she was having intercourse with roger  peter on one occasion had anal intercourse with her one or two words time  later when she was on top of roger someone was holding her  hips could be head   sarah said she scratched roger 's back   when roger was on top of her peter then said  i'm sorry sarah said she scratched his back when  roger was on top of her three or four words   peter also according to her testimony said that  you've screwed her up now   and sarah also said that she felt pain  pain in her vagina   during sarah 's testimony she stated that when she was on the bed although roger was kissing her she did not kiss him back  however in cross-examination she conceded that at  preliminary enquiry she said that she consentually kissed roger  while they were on the bed   she further testified that her answers at the preliminary  hearing were true   it was also brought out in the cross-examination that when she  was in the bedroom she admitted her memory was hazy and that she blacked out from time to time   sarah also stated that the accused matthew came into the bedroom and on one occasion pulled her legs apart  in cross-examination she said on one occasion she thought it was  matthew   on another occasion she said he tried to grab my legs  and force them apart but i wouldn't let him   again in cross-examination she again stated that she screamed and yelled and demanded that roger get off her and leave her  alone   doctor sandra grey was the first crown witness three or four words in my opening remarks   she is a family practioner in the city of salem   she's presently on medical leave and is in residency in three or four words   she said that she examined sarah around eight p m on  february the eighteenth nineteen ninety- word in the hospital in salem   she said there were bruises on the back of her left forearm and on her right forearm and her upper arm   bruises were also located in the hips both knees and her upper thighs and the crotch area   she said she also had a significant abrasion of the bottom of the vagina   this is the area she called the word   and that the bottom of the vagina had bled  she also said the opening of her vagina a few words    in chief she said in her opinion the injuries to the vaginal area were consistent with forceable entry into her vagina  without that area being lubricated  she also said that where there is sexual desire there usually  is lubrication  she also testified that she did not conduct a rectal examination as sarah did not mention anal intercourse  she did confirm however that there was no trauma around the  outside of the of the anus   in cross-examination she conceded that she did not have any opinion as to whether alcohol would have an effect on lubrication in the vagina  she again confirmed that the abrasions in the vagina were consistent with forceable non-consenting intercourse   she said if sexual desire is present in word  female lubrication is also present in almost all situations  especially in a young healthy woman who recently has started her period  she was also asked by miss flynn if the sexual activity started out with lubrication and went on for a prolonged period of time would that cause abrasion abrasions    her answer was that she said normally unless there was a long delay maybe a word more than five to ten minutes  to the point of ejaculation unless this occurred this should not  happen  she then said that because the initial lubrication provided by the female gland is supplemented of course by the ejaculate  but then she did go on to say word summary  she said that without ejaculation it might be possible but highly unusual in a very young woman who recently commenced menstruating  but really it was a fairly word  detailed summary of of of her evidence   word examination a few words  cross-examination  now the accused roger rabbit testified on his own behalf   he's now twenty-three years of age he's employed with city paving solutions   he described the event that occurred on february the seventeenth and until he testified as to what happened in the bedroom during the early hours of february the eighteenth his evidence is consistent with the other witnesses including sarah   during the party at moon street he described an incident where sarah appeared to freak out after which someone  bumped her against a chair   he said she then hit the fridge in a word  roger said his consumption that evening included three beers four shots of sambuca and one to one and a half joints of marijuana   after peter had retired to his bedroom roger said he was looking for cigarettes   he went into peter 's room sarah came with him  after the door was closed he said we kissed and then i undid my pants   sarah was on top of him and then undid her pants after  which she took them off along with her panties   peter was on the bed and was asleep  after they french-kissed she stayed on top of him   he inserted his penis in her vagina and then began to make passionate love  when they were having intercourse matthew and juan  entered the room   they saw sarah on top of him  after flicking the lights on and off matthew enquired as to where his dress pants were one to three words   after he retrieved his clothing he left the room and closed the door   sarah and roger switched positions and continued the sexual intercourse  peter woke up and he appeared to be angry  before sarah left he said she gave him her name and phone number  he testified that sarah did not say or do anything which would indicate that she was not a willing participant in their sexual  word   he also denied that peter had anal intercourse with her  word cross-examination roger said that they had sex for about twenty minutes and that he had ejaculated  in his hand multiple words   the next witness was the accused peter dunstan   he is now twenty-four years of age   he lives with his mother in salem   and since word he's been working with  word a native word   he and his girlfriend have a seven-month-old child   his evidence was to the effect that when he returned from  streamers' he was so intoxicated that he retired to his bedroom  he was awakened by sarah and roger having sex on his bed  after he told them to leave he said sarah became angry  however he said that he dressed and then left the room  he denied that he had anal intercourse with sarah or that he stated he had fucked her up the ass  when sarah and roger were having sex he said they were both undressed   the last accused to testify was matthew childs aged twenty-three   he's presently working at the easyshop word  salem   he was not a resident at moon street and therefore when he arrived at that residence he had a change of clothes including an extra pair of dress pants as he knew they were going out to  the bar later that evening  he said sometime during the evening he lent a pair of his pants to  roger as he had in turn given his jeans to sarah to wear to the bar as she had torn her skirt   after they left the bar around two a m he drove juan's car back to moon street   as he was leaving he ascertained that sarah had been asleep in the back of word car  she said she wanted to return to the party  after their return to moon street matthew some time later wanted to retrieve his pants from peter 's room  he entered his bedroom turned on the light and observed  roger and sarah having sex   he said they were naked   sarah was breathing hard   peter was asleep on the bed  after enquiring as to where his pants were he obtained them from the bed  he then turned off the light and left the room  he said he did not touch sarah or pull her legs apart   when he left peter was asleep   i want to deal with the criminal record of the accused  only applying to one witness or one accused and that would be the accused matthew   now he gave evidence and i think quite properly brought it out on his own accord   he was asked whether he'd ever been convicted of a criminal offence  he replied that he had been convicted of theft in nineteen ninety and received a fifty dollar fine  now i have to give you some instructions as to what use if any that you can make of a criminal record in a in a  trial  this criminal record was introduced into evidence not into  word only for the purpose of testing the credibility  or truthfulness of the accused as a witness   you may use the evidence of the criminal record when you consider  his credibility  in order to decide whether a person with a criminal record of this nature is the kind of witness who might be believed   please remember that a criminal record does not necessarily mean that someone is a liar in the same way that a clean record does not necessarily mean that someone is truthful   when you examine matthew 's record you should consider three things  first you should consider the nature of the offence   in particular you should consider whether matthew has committed an offence that involved dishonesty   a conviction for an offence that involves dishonesty obviously has more bearing on credibility than a conviction for an offence that does not involve dishonesty   two you should consider when matthew  committed the offence  a recent conviction may be more relevant to credibility than a conviction for an offence that was committed a long time ago   third you should consider the number of convictions   a single conviction for a criminal offence is usually less serious  than a long list of convictions  these three factors should help you to decide whether or not  you will believe the accused's evidence  i should tell you however that i do not think that this one conviction where he received a fifty dollar fine is  significant   however please remember that you are the judges of the facts and you do not have to accept my opinion  it is important for you to understand that this previous conviction is not evidence of matthew 's guilt in this trial  you are not allowed to treat that conviction as evidence that he is more likely to commit the offence with which he's charged  also you are not allowed to treat his record as evidence that he is more likely to commit criminal acts in general  the only reason this evidence of a criminal record was admitted was for a very limited purpose  it's for the purpose of deciding whether or not you can believe his testimony  and again i've said it once i'll say it again i don't think in this case that his criminal record that one charge is very  significant word   now i'm now going to continue towards the end of my charge but i will now deal with the case against each of the accused separately  i wanna want to deal wi  i'm gonna going to have to deal with  each accused separately   as to the charge against roger   if you word accept his testimony  three or four words and all the other evidence that was  word and particularly the testimony that sarah  consented to the act of intercourse then you must return a verdict of not guilty  even if you do not accept the evidence word  for the defence that sarah consented but you are left with a reasonable doubt then you must also return a verdict of not guilty  even if you are not left with a reasonable doubt by the testimony according to roger that sarah consented to have sex with him you must still go on to determine whether or not he is guilty  in other words you must be satisfied that the crown has proved  each and every ingredient of the offence as i instructed you earlier   to sustain the charge beyond a reasonable doubt two or three words guilty  but if you come to that conclusion of course then four or five words guilty  as i said earlier i keep repeating this as it's so important the crown must establish the guilt of roger beyond a reasonable doubt
