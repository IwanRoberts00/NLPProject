 ya we met our two new professors today   and uhm the first morning the first part this morning he assigned us gave all our assignments  and readings  which seems to be a great deal   hmm  but we got them photocopied and we've got them all  and the uhm one in the afternoon just had one text with exercises  word   and it's uh but we have   exam two exams on this friday and assignments due  and it's going to be more challenging than the first three weeks i'm quite certain  ya   ya probably talk to you more about that when the word  takes over cos i you  can't say anything really  specific about it  that's   mhh mhh   ya   so it's uh   i don't think i'm gonna going to go in the afternoon though  i'm  for that course   it's quite interesting because he's very up-to-date   good laugh   again   i couldn't sit through forty-five more hours of it  he's an excellent teacher  oh that is good  that that is even  better  ya   mhh hmm  but uhm  he really goes to town  hmm  when do we get our marks from the other things  two weeks  is that right  two weeks for the other ones  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  huh i wonder if the they'll be available before that   i don't know  you mean to see these   i wonder if you like if they're  going to hand back the exams sort of thing so you can see what you did wrong  i think if you want to see the exam you have to go to the professor  oh  but you don't get them back at all   oh ya  that's usually the way with final exams anyway  ya  ya  huh  oh well  mhh hmm   oh am i ever tired  i'm just whipped  i was just fine until i got in that traffic jam up there and now i'm really really tired  did you meet any childhood friends at the wedding  yes i did yes  that was very interesting i must say laugh   pathetic laugh   there was this guy that like is a real like real  from very far back in my childhood   say grade five  and he at by grade  fi five six i think he had failed already twice and he still wasn't doing that well  mhh hmm   and i sat beside him in class and uh and  he was you know he was kind of attractive  he was a cute boy and he was already thirteen and had a little bit of you know peach fuzz on his chin   mhh hmm   and i was eleven  thought he was just great laugh   and but he was so dumb laugh   and you know and i was really really good   that didn't matter did it   but i sat beside him and the teacher had and we were right back at the far corner uh from the teacher who was right at the front in the other corner  and he'd say jerry   and he'd go what's the answer what's laugh the answer  and i'd say ten laugh   and he'd go ten laugh   she'd never know the difference  oh dear   so you met him  ya but you know he was sort of in my life all the time you   know   mhh hmm   i think he went out with one of my best friends in high school  mhh hmm  and but i you know i didn't i didn't   go out with him or anything like that  what's he doing now   but i've known him off and on  well he's working at at the ford plant  and uh  mhh hmm   has been for years  ya has been for years  and i've known h   he's he went out west and married a girl  brought her back when he was in his twenties  and she was there too  mhh hmm  and uh laugh and uh   he he uh they both really always at a function always get really really plastered and like really embarrass themselves and everybody around them  and uh i was just it was just humiliating   laugh   but they do the same thing everytime  ya they just like lose control   everyone's used to it   mhh hmm  uhm he was saying i really want you laugh   i've always wanted you  you're the woman for me  i should have married you  and he always says it  you know we'll just be standing together and he'll say this and then his wife will laugh come up just in the middle of it going that's right jer that's right  and i'd just walk away laugh   and then his wife was getting sort of peeved and   it was really awful  people they shouldn't have free bars at weddings laugh  they should make people pay five bucks apiece for those drinks and then give them the money back at the end of the night  don't tell them they're gonna going to  do it laugh   mhh   cos uh there was some younger g  girls there who are friends of the bride's daughter   and they were really really out of control  mhh hmm   they were really bad   they must have been quite young  well the no she's i know she's my age  she's forty-five and she's got a twenty-   t two year old daughter  twenty-one   okay   mhh hmm   twenty-one i guess  and uh her friends are real  they're they're deadheads  mhh hmm  and they they go around in a painted-up v w volkswagen microbus following the grateful dead all over the states and you know wearing hippy clothes and stuff  i don't know laugh   back forty years  ya   ya things haven't changed much  but i sort sort of grew up in that house  they were as a family with five children and they were all really close in age  like my friend angie was a twin and i was actually  sue 's friend first cos they went to seperate high schools  mhh hmm  so i met her angie  through sue and then i hung around sue or  angie more because she had uh a kid the same age as mine  we were both housewives together and sue was single and fancy-free  okay   and and uh but you know  in high school i knew their brother elton   he was just a bit older   but i didn't know know the youngest and the oldest that well even though they were not that different in age  but you know when we were in our twenties and thirties i got to know them a little bit better  mhh hmm  and uhm the it's a really nice family  i know the parents really well too  they weren't at all well  you know it was such such heat and uh  they're they're close to eighty  the parents  and it was really a difficult uhm time for them  cos they they're very good hostesses and they think they have to run around and you know make people  happy and serve food all the time  mhh   ya   and you know it was just too hot for that stuff  ya   too much for them   it was it was too humid too hot  it was unb unbearable just about  but it was a lovely wedding  it was they had roses everywhere  and uh it's a beautiful beautiful huge like park-like uh uh uh yard garden you know in their   uh around their house  mhh   and they had lilies and a this  beautiful arbour with clematis growing over it and they hung wedding bells and had uh had the wedding there  aww   you know chairs facing this thing  mhh hmm   and then they had tables out in the  the other part of the garden  and it was just you know just  like this pretty much  mhh hmm   you know nice and nice and  comfortable  yup   the the second day was really hot but we came back for a visit  so uh words   so it's hot in ontario now   oh is it ever  was it cooler in the townships  mhh hmm  we had rain  each day  oh   oh did ya you   oh no  a little bit at night  but no in the daytime it was just excruciating  we were planning on going to down to  the beach and uhm the it we couldn't go because there was too much bacteria in the water   ya algae and  no it's uh sometimes uh when it gets really hot they  they have uh fecal coliform in uh that  mhh hmm   it makes you itch  ya it it uhm the e coli bacteria  proliferate when in ya  mhh hmm   and oh no you just get sick  it it i don't know if it was that kind of pollution when i was kid but when i was a teenager you wouldn't go in lake erie  but you know after that it was fine  you know they made all kinds of laws about companies and   municipalities putting sewage and you know crap chemicals in there and  put in there   mhh hmm  and uh and it's been pretty clean ever since  but it's just been really hot  so you'd say it's getting better now the great   the great lakes   ya i don't know   i i when i asked about it they  i we i had a bit of an argument with one of the girls from vancouver  she was saying how wonderful vancouver is and how horrible st thomas is and i said well to tell you the truth i didn't even like it there because i get up in the morning  cos it was kind of a trip to see mountains  i'd never seen mountains before  and i get up in the morning and rush out to see the mountains and every morning there'd be this brownish yellow haze along there cos   it's quite industrial  mhh   the wind blows the from the sea blows   the pollution and it the mountains are there and it just stops and hangs around there  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and it's a big city  it smells bad  and you can see the pollution  and i said look it's polluted there  you've got smog   so this was at the wedding  no it was the next yesterday   ohh laugh   and well she was just being a grouch anyway  but you know just to defend st. thomas i said at least there's fresh air here  mhh hmm  we don't have smog  and she said oh you you think there's no pollution in toronto  and i i'm not talking about toronto  it's polluted in montreal too  it's polluted in toronto and it's polluted in vancouver  i'm talking about the difference between a small place and a big place  mhh hmm  ya   and the fact that they've got those mountains there   so she likes it where she lives  ya mainly because it's far away from the parents laugh  you know her parents and her parents-in-law are ah   are both in st. thomas and  but they're all quite old and feeble  ya ya  i wonder why she likes being away  ya i don't know  she's probably g got her life centered there now  ya   but anyway   i don't know like it is kinda kind of  disheartening  we were both saying that  to go back there because it's uhm it's   sorta sort of depressed there  you know the whole economy of the place depended on the automotive industry  and then you know and the last recession   all the factories just closed right down  everybody's unemployed  it's got a really high unemployment rate there  mhh hmm  and there's nothing really to take over  it's building back a little bit but it's not like a touristy place  it's not it doesn't have any geographical drawing card  there's no mountains  there's no there's a lake but it's a few miles away  mhh hmm   used to it was it's there  because of the railroads  it's halfway between buffalo and / - > and   detroit between windsor and toronto  yes   it's exactly halfway so all the railroads converge there  mhh hmm  so it's a real railroad town  all the nice houses were built by railroad men  is the railroad still active  no  you know how you know how they closed down railroads everywhere   yes yes that's right ya
