 he said he began to uh write to himself in the third person in his journal and i guess obviously began to get a sense of like ah what a character is or a   mm hmm mmm mh hmm   that's interesting  you know  ya  because it allows you that distance to kind of   sort of make it up  ya ya   ya   i can see that  ya   ya   ya  course you know my first twelve years of my diary are all made up anyway laugh   are they   did you make them up   oh some of it is   oh that's great   oh my god   that's great  i think that's part of why the reason why  i threw them out laugh   i went back and read them i'm going this isn't true at all  but it must have been at the time  did you think it was true at the time or were you entertaining yourself by just writing   which is  okay too i guess laugh   ya ya huh  i well i th i don't know   that's a really good question  i don't know if i thought they were   i don't know  i don't know if i thought i was fooling myself or  whatever you know   hmm hmm hmm   but it's fascinating  it was fascinating when i went back and read it and i went it wasn't like that at all laugh   like at all laugh   wow  ya  so i figure i've already started practising the notion of the third person in words laugh   it's true   laugh oh dear   laugh scary eh eww eww ghost noises   no no no it's great  it's good  i guess  i guess   whatever it takes  i know  i guess that's the thing eh   i guess that's the thing  whatever it takes   you know i'm jus just   just listening to people going through their processes how they work creative processes it's it's   phenomenal  i mean that's why i love hearing uhm ya someone like timothy findlay talking about how how he works  uhm   ya   it's just great to   you know you you just think huh i'm not crazy  exactly   you understand   yup   exactly   he's as crazy as i am or vice versa  it's it's okay you know  ya   that's the hard   it's healthy  that's the hardest part i think though getting to that point where you just kinda kind of go well you know whatever it takes  it's so funny  i had lu lunch  breakfast with my friend moreen this morning and uh  she's a dancer  yes  and she's a pretty weird egg   oh ya  well sure  she's a dancer  well laugh   no no laugh   i hate it when people do that  she's an artist well what do ya you  expect   laugh   no she's a she's you know she's got her own way about her  mmm  and she was saying that she had gone to dinner  she and her husband had gone to dinner at a friends of her husband's house who   i mean we were all friends  like we were all this sort of group of choreographers working together  and uh since jo the other one has had a baby and stuff she's no longer dancing at all  like she has nothing to do with choreography at all  anymore  mmm   and uh and both irene  and i feel like we've kind of drifted away from her  and well you know whatever sometimes we commiserate about that  and and uhm and anyway they all had dinner and at one point jerry asked so like we never see karen  anymore  where where is she  what's she doing  and i and so she was telling me this   and uh and i said well what did you say  and she goes well i told them that you're sort of you know a strange bird and   and i went ha excuse me   laugh   like the tears just came to my eyes and i was just like well what do ya you mean  like  laugh   and she said oh i didn't say bird i said cat   laugh   oh alright laugh   look who's talking laugh   and and like but the biggest thing is i'm going wow this's really like got to me   you know like and uh i and she said well i mean i meant it in the best way  and you know and she went on to say that you know like i'm in writing and blah blah blah and everything  but i just kept looking at her going i can't believe you said that laugh   i said you know i write that in my diary all the time but it's another thing when i know that somebody else said it about me to  somebody else   ya ya   it's like and you're killing me laugh   ya ya i know  ya i i can  ya i see huh me huh  it was really funny  but afterwards you know then we were riding the bus and i said you know it's i mean it's true   it's true  i mean i am strange and different and all of that  stuff laugh   ya but then what's strange anyway  you know  exactly   everybody's strange then  exactly  every everybody's the same as far as i'm concerned  we just have different  different uh parts of it that  yup   wh wh i was thinking   about this the other day  like you're in a family right an   and you're you think you're the weird one in  the family because you're the artist and everyone else does you know other stuff that involves   you know nine to five jobs or something  and families ya   laugh this sounds strange   laugh okay   work   families and stuff   mm   so you know i've my path is gone  in another direction  but i don't think  well no i'm not going to dismiss myself that way  no exactly  i'm not i'm not the   the odd ball in the family because i'm an artist or because i've chosen to do this kind of work  i mean it's it's everybody's   doing what they do and that and  there's no tha i mean there's no difference to me in terms of you know you're you're each  doing what you do in your life  deep inhale   ya   i i've i mean i've  met people who you know can barely function and   doing what appears to be normal stuff  ya and i i mean i mean if you want to start making comparisons between strange people or people  who can't can't get dressed in the  morning then then   you're in you're incredibly normal   in in every every   sense of the word  laugh   right   ya it's funny eh  so to to be considered strange or  i mean i am considered st strange   i'm not considered  i don't know if people consider me strange  they would never say that to my face  laugh laugh   but they call me the artistic one   and i don't  know if that   right   in your family or   in my in my not in my immediate family   i mean they they know you know they  sort of have that but they also know that i'm all every  all these other things too  but my my larger family the people who don't see me except maybe at thanksgiving or whatever   oh i see what you're saying sure  and uhm you know i've always been that so i am in their eyes this kind of weird one  words   mm  and it's it's you know i'm not there's   nothing weird about me right   no   like what is weird  it's it's this is i i've just been thinking about this  it's ve very   it's a very strange uh  it's like that af after  that whole thing with michael jackson okay  mm mm  next day i'm sitting on the bus  there are these two women   one probably in her early forties  one in her early fifties   and the first person goes laugh well i mean just because they got up on that show and tried to pretend they're normal i mean they're not normal they're not normal  mm hmm  and i mean i i cou s i couldn't believe it  they're sitting there trying to tell us how normal they are  they're just not normal and that's not a normal marriage  i don't i'm sorry that's not a normal marriage  and and just prior to that i had heard the beginning of their conversation or the end of the other conversation which was all about the paul bernardo trial  now that that wasn't laugh  a normal marriage  laugh i think we could make that argument   laugh   and   laugh   and anyway then they started talking all about michael jackson and and you know i'm sorry but that make-up and everything  i mean this person he's not normal he's not normal  and at first i'm just kind of like discretely listening  trying to look out the window  but eventually i found them so fascinating that i turn and i just looked at them blatantly  i'm just looking at them going   you watched it ya  i watched it and i'm going and this is normal  ya   they want ya you want to know why they think that way  it's great eavesdropping  just to really   fascinating   ya ya  and then i thought and i also thought   well these are the kind of people who will sit there and  and you know just decide all sorts of things about whether so and so is normal or not normal or whatever  and i'm and i'm just sitting there going is it really so normal  like if they were me looking at them what would they see  mm hmm  and would they think that that's so normal  to be so completely involved in the lives of all these celebrity stories and celebrity trials and   mm hmm   and then on the other hand i had to go well i guess it is pretty normal because lots of people do it laugh   ya ya ya   and and i do it  i mean i love that junk   laugh   i i eat it up you know  i eat it up  it   but then that's that's one part  of of my life  it's all that's i find that all so confusing  all of that weird normal  uh you know that the  whole thing about  ya ya   mm   there's and there's that whole thing about mundane  i mean there's this whole sort of mundaneness to strangeness   and or fascination with strangeness and i was like ahhh laugh it's so weird  very weird  ya  well normal is a construction so i mean no one fits in  it's not possible  no   it doesn't exist  i mean if you're going to look at the institutions that we've established as being normal the family and i mean  it's all a construction   hmm   oh ya   have you ever seen the movie i think it's called a sweet life  no  it's uhm what's his name michael mike   uh shoot somebody from england  i think he uh   i'm trying to think of other movies that he did  he may have done like my beautiful laundrette  oh it he was in it or he wrote  it or directed it   the director   uh stephen frears  uh oh no  oh i know who you're thinking of  no   but i can't ever remember this guy's name  m mike lee mike  m mike ya it's something like that  he he does he does uhm  movies about about working class   brits   sort of   ya daily life brits   ya ya  often sort of quasi-improvised  ya  and my sweet life is an incredible movie for just  you're sitting there watching this completely you know relatively completely normal famliy and then there's this sort of one girl who has this eating disorder but laugh but but  like everybody looks strange  mm  you know but not like not like     i mean just strange just like affectionately weirdly strange  and familiar  mm mm   laugh   and i'm sitting there going boy he really captured something here  mm   he really captured something about how every family is strange  every family in some way or another  mm hmm  and with all their little quirks and you know  i don't know like what what they cover their teapots with or like just all the littlest things that make   every  single family strange in its own way  right   ya   ya   i thought it was really   or particular maybe   particular is maybe a better word  ya   ya  ya  ya   ya it was really interesting  anyway it was pretty strange to be told laugh that i was  strange by one of my best friends laugh who i think is pretty strange herself laugh   strange
