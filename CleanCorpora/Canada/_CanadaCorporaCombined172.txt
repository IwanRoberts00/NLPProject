 and in fact i uhm many of the people who live in the street inquired about six to eight months after we had taken uh residency in the building uhm as to whether or not they were eligible t  laugh to come to our daycare   mm hmm mm hmm   laugh   unfortunately they weren't because uh you had to be a member of of the i it was a worksite daycare so you had to be a member of the institution in order to be able put your children there  mm hmm mm hmm   probably the hardest uhm the hardest   experience that we came across was uhm a child who was longing   to to come and play in the playground  aw   uhm and so what we did do was we suggested to the parent that uh during the daytime when the other children were outside  as long as the child was healthy uhm they could  they could come and and play and participate but the parent would have to observe the child and make sure that they weren't getting into fights and things like that   mm hmm mm   mm hmm mm hmm   but we we welcomed her into the community but we did have to lock the gates in the evening because for uhm insurance purposes and security purposes we couldn't leave it open  sure  so uhm i think that those kinds of issues help them to  settle into us and us to them uh  uh you were just you were just  saying what can well what can i do in this process  in being sensitive to the needs of all the people involved  i mean tha it's it's  the the teachers are going to tape cuts out   word   mm hmm  and the administration as well and our committees  and the population as a whole the students the board   they all have a slightly different perspective on this  our commissioners  mm hmm  and even the most our commissioners it's   it's different because some are parents v p p and   some some are not  mm hmm  so uhm so so trying to make this a   a word   what you did about that you know uh taking away  the anxiety from at different times from different groups and and making people feel  secure that their their voice will be heard and taken into account  mm hmm mm hmm   people get afraid  they get afraid that that  there's a there's a hidden agenda and everybody's  gonna going to be pushed to the side in whatever group they're not in you know   mm hmm   it's very frightening sometimes   mm hmm   well there was one person who lived on the street who campaigned very hard uhm with with the town uh with the uhm city of uhm sorry i don't know whether it was  toronto west or a if it was g n a cos it's right on the border so   mm hmm mm hmm   but i know that th there  was there was a lot of discussion as to whether or not this uhm particular uhm daycare was actually going to take  place there  mm hmm  and uhm she she campaigned quite hard and she got quite a few of the neighbours riled  and and and ready to go to battle over this  mm hmm mm hmm   uhm but i think wh when   you meet people face to face even if that first encounter isn't as pleasant as one would hope it would be we're all human and we all really want the same things which is s space   and peace and tranquility and clean air and all the things that they wanted were the things that we wanted   mm hmm   and so uh we uh i guess just by uhm  presenting ourselves uhm and almost using the opportunity to push ourselves on them made them realize that we weren't the big monster the big ogre that that uhm he unknown entity  that they thought  and so my feeling is that we should be addressing in this letter the need for us to uhm be able to identify with these different groups as early as possible so that we can make people feel comfortable about the move and and   so that the community that we eventually re  relocate to feels comfortable about the fact that we are now going to be in their word   mm hmm   mm hmm   that is an excellent idea   so that would be a logical extension of this point  mm hm mm hmm  i think it's a very important point to address too because i think it makes people realize they the  need for advance notice and to be part of the process  it is   mm hmm   that's all we're asking for is enough time so that we can adjust and the people around us will adjust and and   and tha that's time  there's there's a healing process that has to happen  you have to have closure and you have to have an open house perhaps whereby people in the community   din come can come   mm hmm mm hmm   word wonderful idea  an open house so people can picture themselves in this environment  mm hmm mm hmm  so what i'd like to see is perhaps a relocation committee   organized where events can be planned uhm  and and we can try and and   take into consideration the anxieties of the children and the parents and the and the and the community that we're moving into as well as some of the concerns that the  leedsman school board may have  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  and when they read the letter i would also  that that very point if if  it sufficiently states that we want to work with the board on this process if it's sufficiently accommodating to their position because they're in a difficult spot  it's hard financially to come up with the money they have to  so i want the tenor of the letter to carry that  so you want uh so what we're saying then is we want to make sure that we have advance notice in order for us to form a relocation committee so that we can work with the teachers administration committee members parents students uh the school board and the community uhm   and the community that's right  and and to do it within budget  mm hmm  i think if uhm if  it's done well i think that we can integrate and and and  perhaps even draw more students from the   from the direct community that that   we relocate to   oh i agree i agree  i think uhm sarah mailer's point uhm was very well taken that we're uhm we're so far from the people we serve that other client possible clientele many of them don't even consider us because we're not part of their lives  we're building w so far away  they never see it  mm hmm  they never think of it as an opportunity and it's frightening to send your tiny child all that way  mm hmm  so uhm we'll be we'll be  more in the midst of a community seen as a option  yeah  what i can do perhaps is work on uhm j the second segment then i wr a a a   a further extension of your letter  by talking about you know the importance of advance notice  specifically for this ro for this purpose   relocation purpose  mm hmm   okay   uhm that might help  that's fine   i i if i can get it uhm if i can get it to you before the committee and have and have copies made so that we can pass them out to people people can read it at the committee and comment on it   at the same time as they're commenting on yours   mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   uhm i think that's probably the best route isn't it   yeah and then we can sandwich it   what i'd i'd like you to do is when you get this letter uh if there's a way that this can be  sandwiched in do you know what i mean   mm hmm   that it it it may mean for example  rewriting point six  mm hmm  okay  mm hmm   or it may be reorganizing the   the whole way the letter is done and if that   if it it says it better then that's the way we should do it  but if uhm if we can if if people can look at this and say okay i think that   that this needs to be added in and take what you've done and sort of w   i i would like for them that night to walk away having a good picture of what they're voting on  mm hmm  so if there's something that is a logical insertion we move this up we move this down and this goes in here  mm hmm   right  that would really be helpful so that they don't go away  the only concern i had that was so important that they don't go away thinking that we're going to continue to develop this afterward  i'd like them to get a good feeling  do you know what i mean  without with some small tinkering but a good feeling like this is what they're voting on is what's going   out and for you to come tonight and get these ideas ready is perfect  right and   so if you have that ready and copied and this letter is ready and copied and any other ideas that come in uhm ho that's why i want to get them before the meeting so that they're down  mm hmm   and we'll be able to compose this in a final form pretty well at the meeting and vote on it because  we need the vote of the school committee to to  send it in  mm hmm   yeah i guess that's probably the best way to handle it is  to to uhm to do it that way cos there's very little time left before the end of the school year   unfortunately yeah   i'm just wondering if uhm let's assume that i get this tomorrow and if i did have time to write something up  mm hmm   mm hmm  would you want me to distribute it ahead of time so that people have a chance to look at it and see the changes or do you think that would confuse people  let's see  of course it depends on how much i write and i won't know how much i write until i sit down and do it  yeah you know the school  are you going to be home tomorrow  no i'm not mm   okay uhm  i'm home on the weekend though  because the because i know  that cher's going to be in tomorrow and i'm sure she's going to be working on this  okay   i'm almost positive  mm hmm  she could fax me a copy  so there   that would be great  there you go  and we can take a look at it and see  it may be that there may be some  some things you'd you'd like to see uhm  sentences we were doing or or or some things like minor things that you'd like to see  and here there may be sent a couple sentences you wanna want to put in  in that case then uhm i think that can be done at the meeting  mm hmm  dontcha don't you think  mm hmm   that that that that   could be done   the minor things yeah  there's things i'm not as worried about uh the nuances and things we can we can  play with at the meeting and i think people can people will a af appreciate being part of that process  yeah   right  uhm   and this point here now  whether people have it prior to the meeting  mm hmm   my feeling is that i think that i can't imagine anybody not agreeing with us  i think that's such a super point  so i guess we can't lose by sending it to people before the meeting but i think that if we do it at the meeting  w they're going to uh redo it as well   mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  okay it's it's uh it's logical  uh   it's just that if you give them so much information sometimes people don't actually read the whole thing before people other people start commenting and then uhm you may be commenting without having read the whole thing and and   not not feeling comfortable with it so   it really depends on the length of what i do  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   if i do something that's fairly lengthy   then i would like to be able to uhm to  have people have a look at it even if it's only  even if it's only the the   night before  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm  uhm you know it's just so that they have an idea as to what my proposed changes to the letter would be so that they're not hit off guard with it you know   mm hmm mm hmm   good point
