 it's just sort of here it is teach it tough  uhm if you know what's going on you can understand it and you can interpret it  uh since i was on the writing committee i can i can  give my teachers information  other places it's simply well this is it i guess  we'll this is what we're supposed to do   one of the reasons that the ministry went towards this we were told is to move teaching away from being teachers that are just student-centred  so that this is what the students are supposed to learn  that's that's sort of the message of these new programs  it's okay what are the tea teachers  what are the students supposed to learn what are they supposed to do rather than okay i'm a teacher what am i gonna  going to teach   uh it's really to sort of turn it around so that it's the student   who is the dr driver who is driving the course rather than well i think uh that this is what uh i'd like to teach rather than this is what the students need either once they get into university  and in in the creation of the families  our questionnaire was for the students in the general the  pre-universe pre-university side was okay not what do your students need english for in the cegep  that's not what the courses are for  once they get out of the cegep and into university what are they going to do in english  and at our cegep they said they are going to have to read and they will have to listen to things but they won't have to write and they won't have to speak very much  uhh the technical side uh was more varied once they were on the job market they will have to write letters in english and maybe make   job propo uh job proposal contract proposals  they will have to phone up eight hundred numbers in california and figure out what the person is saying about why this machine doesn't work  uhh that sort of thing  so with that feedback uhh i i think we can  come up with some courses that will will suit their needs   when they get to university they they will have to r read textbooks in english definitely the resource material and all the rest of it but it would be uncommon unless they ended up at mcgill or concordia or something that they would actually have to write papers or anything in english or that they would have to speak at in any depth in to anyone in english  so that's why the people said when the students get to university yes they have to read lots of stuff in english and they probably have to maybe listen to tapes and videos and that ah or maybe a guest speaker or something but they won't have to produce in english  so so that's why they're  it was very much a a few words   ah another thing behind another concept behind   the new courses uh was and there's been a great discussion as to what the translation of comp&eacute;tence is it   is   is it competency or proficiency or you know pick a word out of a hat sort of thing  uh the aim was to to come up with an outline for a course where students would actually be able to do something when they finish the course uh as in be able to speak to someone be able to write something be able to read something as opposed to saying the students will will be able to manipulate six and a half verb forms in uh two voices and i don't know what  uhm so the the aim of the course   is is not n is not grammatical accuracy  that's part of the game  that's one of the ways we can judge whether the text is acceptable  but but it's certainly not the  the only thing   another pandora's box is evaluation   uhh evaluation  and again it is up to each cegep to come up with what is called  and if you have friends who teach in cegeps uhh it has either been dealt with and they're now reacting to it or it's going to be changed  chalk on the blackboard noise   it's what called the p i e a which is the  politique institutionnelle d'&eacute;vat  d'&eacute;valuation des apprentissages   so each cegep so it's institutionnelle each cegep comes up with their policy for assessing evaluating learning   uh and as a further step to that the cegep comes up with one and then each department can add things to it that they feel are specific particular to their own department  uh it can say things like students must attend all their classes but could could miss up to seven hours  and that's okay  our cegep has a different policy uhh which a lot of us don't appreciate but anyhow it says what it says  it says that students are not obliged to attend classes  uh it seems like a weird way to put it but anyhow that's what it says  uh so each cegep has its own p i e a and they write out a list of things as sort of this is how we evaluate students  uh and it could be things like there must be at least three tests through the semester uh no test can count for more than forty marks or thirty marks or or whatever  so this p i e a goes through the whole list of what you can and cannot do and how students are evaluated  obviously with this change uh in courses by competency this has to be redrafted  some cegeps have done it  ours is in the process of doing it   what the ministry has said is chalk on the blackboard noise  it's sort of it's pass-fail but it's not pass-fail   that's about what they said  what they've said is the course description here if a student  does that they've met the objectives a pass mark is sixty that gives them a sixty   not if they've done sixty percent of what's there but if they do what's there that's acceptable that's sixty  and then the ministry said okay we've done our work the other forty marks go ahead  each cegep whatever  so uhh it should be interesting  uhm so each cegep is going to come up have to come up with some sort of policy as to okay now how are we going to do this  uh the students have reached the competency uhh so they get sixty percent but what if they reach three levels and not the fourth on can we still pass them  uh or what if they don't get quite all of it uh do we still give them sixty  uhm and these other forty marks is it for term work that they get the forty marks or is it because they do more than is expected here on the final exam and it's only the final exam that counts   uhm in the past if students fail in the sense that there were x exams and you totalled the marks and they got fifty-five they failed  that's it  sorry  you cannot come and wash my car and buy me chocolates and take me out for dinner and redo your your composition which was garbage  sorry you got fifty-five that's it  it stops there  with the reform and the competency-based curriculum  theoretically if the student misses it they have another chance to do it  the problem is so when's the other chance  if you test them on the fifteenth of december and they don't have it  then what's the process for letting them do it again before they have to start another course on january seventeenth   uhh to all these questions there is no clear answer at the moment  uh each cegep each department is trying to come to terms with okay so what do we do with the forty marks that ah  that we have control over  uhh based on the competency theory you wouldn't sort of give them five marks for a bunch of homework they do every second week  that doesn't seem to fit in to the competecy - based  competency-based program  uhh it could be based on a certain number of test word  every semester  uhh it could be bonus marks on the final  you write a composition it's as described here you've got it if it's even better than here i'll give you five extra marks  uh they're all questions that de that local departments are grappling with   uh one strange story that that came out in a cegep is say for example you give your students an  exa give them four exams during the semester and we have this student who gets he's just passing gets  six on each exam  so that gives him how much chalk on the blackboard noise   for the semester's work right  and they have a final exam based on the competency and they write and they speak and they do all the rest of it and they do it fine so they get sixty percent  right  they they either get nothing or they they get it  so they get sixty percent for that   so this chalk noise starts average student ends up with a mark of chalk noise stops eighty-four uhm  audience laughter   anyhow it's uh   question   that's that's the problem with what we ended up with  if they do this they get sixty  figure out the other forty  in the meantime university was saying well so what exactly does a mark mean now  uhm ask me in two years is about all i can say   uhm the other thing about evaluation in the the  law with the uh for the reform the ministry has said that it can impose if it wishes what's called uh  une examen uniforme read provincial exam and   in any of the four uh disciplines in formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale which means french english philosophy or phys ed  so if the ministry decided it wanted to have a common english exam across the province they could do it  uh same for philosophy for phys ed  they have already announced that there will be a common exam for french uh or for in english in the case of english language cegeps  uhm the term is langue word et litt&eacute;rature   that means mother tongue okay  so in in for example our cegep we know there is going to be a french exam common across the province  uhh d the uh timetable's been put off i think by the by a year  i think next year cegeps can do it if they want to but it doesn't have to be done but i think it's the year after that all the students have to do it and that will also be uhm  they will have to pass that to to get  their their dip diploma   question   at the moment no  uh the only reason i think they would move is if they see a major variation and there are cegeps doing this and there are cegeps doing that then they're going to say okay everybody let's come together  affirms a's point   at the moment no  i i haven't even heard anything  so i would be surprised  question   no cos it's not that there's an emphasis on it  all four are there  uh if you speak to anyone across the province i'm sure they'll tell you there's too much work in all these courses rather than the opposite  that's the major cry  it's how can we possibly get through all of this stuff in forty-five hours   uh the other thing is that it's not that  uhm say for example the four skills are are   at this level okay it's not that they that  that each one's worth twenty-five percent  they're all worth everything as described  okay  at this level it's simply give the general general i  general meaning of the main ideas of a text of about  five hundred words  they don't have to go any further than that  so if they can do that they've got it  and it's if there are chalk starts four elements   of of the competency they've got that that that and that they get sixty chalk stops   it's not that this is twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five  it's there's no attribution   of a of a percentage to any of the things  that's it's sort of get it all or  word   okay  so it's it's uh there's certainly not  any more insis uh emphasis placed   on pr on the comprehension uh  actually there's more on the production  there's much more  uh the standard is more defined and more demanding under production than is it it is under the comprehension skills certainly at the lower levels   ya  question question  question continues after interruption   it means you all have a better chance of getting a job  audience laughs   ya   no  and so are there more jobs   uhh at our cegep we hired seven new people last year uh and actually four of them moved from montreal to word   uhm this year we're looking at hiring and some of them have already been identified through the uh interview process last year  we're looking to probably hiring around twelve for the fall uh and seven of those twelve will will be a full-time will have jobs for the full year   five at the moment seem to be only for the fall semester   uh and for example when i mentioned at berbeau in quebec city they did all their hiring last year cos they they  implemented the whole thing all at once
