 mhh hmm   ya i think so  so what are you going to do for christmas then  have we decided yet  i'll probably be down here   so you're going to stay in my apartment  and look after my  place   ya   mhh hmm   cos sharon come up  i don't know  uh she might  okay  that's good   she's getting a lot of hassles from the  family  i'll bet  ya so   ya don't i know exactly what's happening there but uh ya i'll go down and find out  i think i'm gonna going to write a little letter back and give all her family shit  laugh   laugh   well maybe that's not the best way to approach it now   well if they can guilt her out i can guilt them out  well i know but you know let them have their run  and they'll get over it in somewhere  let them work it out of their system  ya  and i think things will work out all right  well they're sort of catholics though  my being divorced twice doesn't exactly help matters  no no laugh   laugh   they don't look at you as somebody somebody  that might stay around permanently maybe  no  that could be the problem   uh no it's just a sin to get a divorce  well  but  and then there's this whole guilt trip they're laying on her  worse than any you laid on us laugh   i don't remember laying any guilt trips on you  mhh a couple small ones here and there  three words   laugh well   as long as it wasn't too many  no  they weren't bad though  i mean you didn't really bother us like phone rings   and you didn't do any gang-up features  no  so it's not too bad  i found a shirt for your dad for christmas  oh ya  bright pink  no  actually remember he was looking for the suede in the    in this part in the top part of of the shirt  laugh   ya   oh ya  well i found one down on my street  on sherbrooke down towards victoria  and the price was right  it was twenty dollars off  it's sort of ah it's sort of a   how can i say  it's got about three colours in it but it's quiet enough  like it's got a lot of   it has a lot of browns  you know what i mean   oh okay  ya   and the browns and kind of like a beige with a touch of uhm  what i call that burnt orange  mhh  not too much  just a touch of it in there  and i tried it on  fits me so it's going to fit him  and it's comfortable on me  it's not tight or anything   oh ya   so if it fits me usually it fits him  dad he's got such taste in clothes sometimes laugh  i know laugh   some of the stuff i won't let him wear at all laugh   such   remember those shirts he brought us  which ones  the ones that made me look like a complete nerd  laugh   laugh   pink with the thing and the whatnot coming down  cough   oh i know  he he he still visualizes me about i don't know but i think about a hundred and forty pounds because everytime he buys something he he  sees that i'm about that size  laugh   three words expanded in his eyes  isn't that nice  maybe three words   it's too bad it didn't work out for more people laugh  nobody gets fat laugh   laugh   your clothes just get smaller laugh   exactly   well   well anyway two words is the cirque du soleil still going on  ahh i think it goes on for  i can't remember the date   is it till the eleventh something like that or the twelfth  hmm   i couldn't get tickets  i tried to get tickets  hmm   did you get any  no but i didn't try  maybe you could try through uh alison   alison   ya  you know   i wou i wouldn't   three words mary-anne   i wouldn't mind taking mary-anne   alison 1 min, 30 sec: conversation about recording, with extra corpus speaker   okay we'll have to try that  ya so i'll try to do it through the nation newspaper   ya  that's the one good thing about the newspaper  laugh   uh uh cough  maybe three words open stories   it's amazing how some people get   no you can get free tickets to just about anything you want  laugh or want to see laugh   write a story on it and if you enjoy it  i was telling benny today the christmas party i was talking to uh the thistle representa rep  representative that came around and it's like two dollars each  i told her that i was going to bring the two of you and she said that was fine  and it's at a place called reggie's  benny 's said he's heard of it  he knows what it is  reggie's  reggie's  what's this for  christmas party  for two words   concordia   oh concordia okay   oh my yes  huh that should be wild  okay   so i told him that i was going to bring two young men 1 minute: conversation about recording   well i really liked that story on the dreamcatcher  i though it was really well written   mhh hmm   the the guy actually deserved to win  you should see on the entry he sent us laugh he's  quite a prolific writer word said  oh he sent a letter   how were the others  uh not bad  uh we have one one favourite called my cousin reg which we're going to entitle as fictional but it's probably a true story laugh   oh really   it sounds quite good   it's like everyone has a little bit of a cousin reg   the uh  it's about a guy who uh lives on a rez informal: indian reservation   a young guy and his cousin reg comes to visit right from another place  and reg is a real basically he's a real asshole  laugh   you know he bothers girls even when they don't like him  he's like going over bothering em them   just just all this stuff  he gets into fights and he gets drunk and at the end of it he kills this dog right and sort of swears him to secrecy  and then you know like he's freaking out  this kid is freaking out over his cousin reg  right laugh   oh my gosh   and then all of a sudden someone comes and takes reg  away  you know like i guess like reg 's family arrives and he  two words   laugh   maybe three words him is a rest  everyone has a rest from cousin reg right  mhh  and so all of us still sat down and we all read it and we all laughed and said well we're going to have to say this is a fictional thing  and in in this story like before it the guy says you know i'm changing the name of my cousin to  you know so so no one will know who it is but i mean if you know who the guy is it's not hard to trace down his cousins  no no   laugh but i'm sure you can trace down who his cousin is laugh and find out that this guy killed the dog  laugh   he shot some poor dog some guy's dog so it's   laugh oh dear   so the guy's an embarrassment to his family  laugh ya and this guy wrote about it  and he's one of the contest winners laugh quite few words   that was the story we remembered the most   oh no   like every one of us laughed at it laugh  what about the other stuff  were there any female writers  uh ya  some females writers  uh webequie has this huge preoccupation with death  you're right   almost every story coming out of uh webequie uhm had something to do with someone dying you know committing suicide or  word it's the forth  it's the forefront thing in in your mind  like at the moment  mhh hmm   you know what i mean  if there's a lot of suicides in that area you're naturally going to think about those things when you think about home  ya  but like to me that's like that's like   not a very healthy indication of the town  i mean that's that's  you know your your youth's major preoccupation is death and suicides and whatnot i mean obviously there's  there's something wrong there  you know  no   mhh hmm   but then we always knew there was something wrong there   anyhow laugh   that's why we write about it   laugh   you fellas better start finding something good about  weben webequie   oh we do find good things about webequie  we've written good things about webequie   i mean people just don't see that  they just   no   of course they hear all the all the   other scandalous stories laugh and they get off on that a lot more  right right   that's true  but i mean the guy is a scandal  he should just get out of there  ya  you know the the reason why i think he's holding on so much is he's got a lot of two words    you know like you don't hold on this to m   uh with such a such a grip unless there is something there  mhh hmm  i mean it's it's kind of obvious  when your financial statements that you hand in  ya   you're supposed to hand in your financial statements every year  and the statements that you hand in are two years out of date  right ya   then you refuse to give you know your  your holding company  like you know how we have uh eastmain enterprises  and that   mhh hmm   well could you imagine them refusing to give their annual statements at a uh annual band meeting of everybody  no i can see them   well that's what they did at uh  webequie for sageen  but many times those things are presented uh uh to the public  and the public don't understand what they're about anyway   mhh hmm   but these guys refused to even bring up any numbers   so i mean  cough   i know the first years uh i went to the band council meetings at home hardly anyone ever questioned the amounts of money that we were that they were being asked to to pass   to approve for whatever project was going on  to approve ya   that's why nis'ko became such ah a white elephant in the end  i mean you know  mhh hmm   and then they tried tried to bury that and you can't bury it  it's going to come up all the time   that's probably why you see an entire new band council there  it could be  it could be   but uh you don't or people seem to be afraid to speak out and say well that's uh i don't think you should  give them any more money  nobody wanted to two or three words   well the problem with that is i think is is   it's because when you do speak out you get you get uh you get singled out   you know what i mean  and and people sitting up there that are supposed to be listening to you and looking for your responses and whatnot attack you  mhh hmm  and i mean it's it's embarrassing to be attacked  word hand   first of all they're sitting higher than you  you know like usually they're not even the same level  no and you know that they have disagreed with you that   three - quarters of the of the  public that you're sitting with will feel the way that they do  because they're sitting in that position  and people come out from out of nowhere   and a and attack the system that they're you know    word   mhh hmm   ya   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   it's uh   it's it's like what they did to the trappers  they ganged up on them and they they   used cree culture against them  you know their own culture and they go this is for the best of the people the best of everybody and you're the one holding it up you're the one causing the problems you know  ya   and cree way of life is sharing and cooperation everything else  and so they're saying you're going against that when you're actually living the traditional life and they're not  right right   ya  you know they're the ones forcing you into that situation where to live by your own principles you have to do the wrong thing  ya yup  and that's what i feel is wrong   yup i do too
