 so difficult to to really comment  then you and i were talking about uhm the uh  the proposed closure of the various schools and  and the position  mm hmm   uhm we talked about uhm not relocating or identifying a specific location but rather an word   that that we think would be most beneficial for the placement of our school  mm hmm   right  and i was thinking how do we uhm process that with uhm all the reasons why we would like to keep the &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re system open  cos we did a lot of background work on that uh last year   when the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res were uhm somewhat vulnerable  before  so i'm just curious to know uh if if  all of that information is gonna going to   be compiled into one document that will go to the l s b school board  uh huh   uh huh uh huh   well uh what we have done so far is the list   y you you remember the list that we made of all the characteristics of the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res   mm hmm  well that list was handed in by our school and by  beakervale and uhm i believe by larkley as well  many of the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res were there handed in that that tuesday night when we all went to beakervale  high school and gave some of our ideas to the board about what we would like to see for that and at the beginning of the race  mm hmm   that's where we're letting them know exactly what kind of schools we want to have  that can also be included in just uh what we wanted to do at that point was to have all the &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res uh and &eacute;coles secondaire handed in to the board to show the board that we all want to keep this kind of school  we want all want these characteristics to remain and that that is something   that that is really we're not here to debate about  we just wanted to know that these schools that are vulnerable where they'll be placed  mm hmm  so that's already gone in in this discussion but it can also be added to whatever we come up with about our particular school and sit in with that as well  that would probably be a fine idea  okay  okay  just because i feel that uhm uh if one is to uh know the position paper uhm based on an uhm  the importance of keeping the school open uhm one has to include the uniqueness uhm of of uh  you know  mm hmm   of this school   uhm so you didn't identify specific locations but you did identify geographic areas that you felt uhm  would be appropriate and that was based on  the central trying to choose a location that was most central to the entire uhm l s b area  mm hmm   mm hmm   yeah   mm hmm   and well i guess well our our  location   well particularily to to the people we serve   okay   yeah     because because what we were looking at was something north of the thirty between  spruce and fatima or source excuse me spruce  and churchill   mm hmm   mm hmm  and a fatima building  it would be one of the things that we uh we   had with that we would like to h retain   our name so it would also be helpful if we were in  fatima   mm hmm   we're starting to get a form in the craft and a name it would be nice to be able to continue with that   oh gosh imagine if we were able to keep that  it's true   mm hmm   it's true   mm hmm   there's a lot of them   mm   it's all part  really when we sat down and looked at the map it all became very clear that for us for our clientele we can't go too far away from them  we've we're already too far away  mm hmm mm hmm  so uhm so this is not for changing it closer  what is the uhm the location that bayside serves  do you know  it's closer i it's   i believe it's from s really around our school boundary over towards the  missiongate area  mm hmm   i believe it goes as far in in   towards that area  okay   i don't know the exact location but uhm on the map uhm  elizabeth will be able to to show you  but it's really from our school over  and they share with the p s b g m also school board   mm hmm  okay  yeah  it's a it's a rental and they  they share  there is about two hundred students at bayside   l s b students  mm hmm   it would be a long hike for them though to move   to to go from let's say the  missiongate area to somewhere in between spruce and  aberman   would it not  that would be the farthest that people would have to go i believe  i was thinking a lot of them actually'd   actually would be somewhat in the area of our school  hm   you know  a little farther a little farther away from that  yeah   if uh if they're looking at an l s b school uhm and and they're not going to rent the facilities  we looked at the map and what was available  it's still a long way for them but it's  by bus it's not it's not that far  i mean it's it's it's d   just down fatima boulevard  mm mmm   you know   it's a straight straight route not too bad but uhm  there isn't too much else otherwise   mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  uhm so i don't know if that's going to happen  if there's going to be a joining of the of the  two schools but uh if if that is the case it would bring our population up to the point where we would need a fairly large school to to handle our  or if they were allowed to maintain where they were  would that would   moving our school it's difficult to say how much additional clientele one would get by moving our school to a more central location  mm hmm   and we wouldn't know for a couple years would we because uhm  we'd have to settle and let the community get to know us and   find out if there's a market for our kind of school  mm hmm   but uhm i think   i think with the public if all the schools are abominable then everyone will have to we have to wait   for the dust to settle everywhere because all all  these changes will take place and then you'll have to get used to it's like moving into a new community almost and learning  which schools are uhm belong to which school board and and and  the locations in all of the schools so it would almost feel you're like moving into a new community   that's right   that's right   oh yes    and and there are complicating factors too in that the l s b may move into early immersion  th it's possible  mm hmm   and if they do well then that's uh competition for the type of school that we have   i still would rather send my daughter to an  &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re because i think it's a different experience and i think that she'll have more the type of experience  that that he was mentioning  mm hmm  you know  that's right  and and the closer you can get to that without the child becoming stressed which  i i don't see any any  problem with that so far with my daughter  that's right   mm hmm  uhm the better  mm hmm  but a lot of people when you're when you're sending your child into school you might say well  they've got early immersion so that's what i'll go for  mm hmm  so that'll be a competition for our school so it's  so that'll be a factor if that comes in in the next few years and i had a feeling don't have anything to base it on at all  but it's just gut and i think that people are gonna  going to be moving towards early immersion in the l s b  yeah well it certainly is it looks like it's  a growing trend in the uh in the p s b g m system  uhm and and uhm in fact there are a lot of schools that are bilingual schools and and  many children choose to go to either the english classes or the french classes but there are bilingual schools within the p s b g m  mm hmm mm hmm   mm hmm   so you're seeing this more and more  i think it's almost a a cheating way of getting around the bilingual program uhm because uhm as was s suggested you don't really learn uh a true y you're  learning an academic language as opposed to learning a functional language  <mm hmm   right right  and uh that's really unfortunate you know because uhm uh  y you grew up in ontario i think   right   mm hmm mm hmm   so you've had the same experience i had where i learned a very academic french in school and went out into my community which was a french community and tried to apply what i had learned in school and was laughed at there  mm hmm   mm hmm   laugh   laugh   uh it was very frustrating and uh so what i literally did was i just entrenched myself in my social life in in in   french uhm to pick up the real french or what i considered to be the real french there the functional french  and then i used that to my advantage uhm and  when uh when i was being tested uh  for for language uhm in school  mm hmm   mm hmm  and so i can remember w when  it came time for examinations we had to uh write on index cards  three topics uh that we would like to talk about  mm hmm  and uh because i did so much horseback riding   in uhm uh in the area i had all the terminology down pat laugh in french   laugh   so uh i knew that that   was somewhat of a unique topic and that by the time i got in to meet the evaluator he may have already spoken to other students fifteen or twenty times on sums subjects such as hockey or uhm baseball uhm or perhaps uhm dance or or or  piano lessons or something like that with other children  wow laugh   uh huh   mm hmm mm hmm   and so he'd probably or she'd probably be quite bored   with that particular topic  mm hmm   and here was this really nice equestrian topic   to to to discuss   mm mm   and i always bet my bottom dollar that that was gonna  going to work  and the other two topics that i picked were usually rather uninteresting bland topics so then i knew that the  equestrian one would be really likely laugh   word   mm   right laugh right laugh   and of course i i   had the i had the uhm the   ease and the and the uh comfort zone to be able to pull it off i with this terminology and so i always got really good grades in oral communication skills in a second language  laugh   that was well planned   mm hmm   loud inhale so hopefully our children will be quite so ingenious and and be able to  well y w on the street there's a there are a couple of girls up the street   faye tina jennifer and what is really wonderful is that the doors are opened for martha whereas some other kids they can only play with the french ki uh  with the english kids  tha that's all  they they feel comfortable with  mm hmm   but the language is a real barrier once you get up to the age where our kids are around eight years old and and so martha can  can play with the english kids  mm hmm   she can play with the french  and if everybody's out in the street then everybody's out  but but it really opens up the world for her to be able to go and and play with these kids as well  mm hmm  and and so some of the things that uh marmaduke was talking about about about  applying it after school uhm become a little less forced because you just begin at an early age to make friends that are speaking that other language  and little peter today  mm hmm   my peter wanted to go up and he wants so badly to play with little julien and jean-jaques and  paul-henri and pierre-louis and and   sebastien all the little boys  mm hmm   up the top of the street is french  down the bottom of the street is english  word   and he wants to go up and play with these little guys  and he says ah i wanna want to   i wanna want to speak french  i wanna want to communicate  mm hmm  so what uh i'm hoping the same thing will happen with him that the incentive will be there and that he'll be able to go out and practice his craft on the street  and learn those everyday things  mm hmm
