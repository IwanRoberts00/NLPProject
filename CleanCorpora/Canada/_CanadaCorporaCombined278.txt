 the atmosphere itself is being altered by human activity  acid rain has already uh des  eliminated plants and animals in tens of thousands of lakes in canada and in europe   ozone depletion is occurring at faster than all projections indicate  every report that we get indicates a surprise because it's more severe than expected while greenhouse gases accumulate at ever greater rates  scientists do not and will not ever know enough to predict the consequences of such atmospheric change  but it is madness to use that scientific ignorance to justify carrying on with business as usual  the thin layer of light coating the earth is responsible for cleansing and replenishing the air water and soil   yet we are tearing it apart at the rate of one acre a second  and with that destruction of our wilderness areas go an estimated fifty thousand species a year   those are the facts   but you don't have to take my word for it   i keep getting people who say over and over i don't wanna  want to listen to you this is too depressing  why should i listen to anything you say  you're the doctor of doom and gloom   well ladies and gentlemen i don't apologize for reciting that litany   if one of my daughters got sick and i took her to the doctor and the doctor told me i'm sorry david your daughter is dying surely to goodness it would be irresponsil b irresponsible  of me to say listen doc i've had a t hard day i don't  wanna want to listen to all of this  the only responsible answer is to say i want you to tell me everything there is to know about her condition  and then we can get on with the business of saving her life  and i don't think that we can afford the luxury of saying this is too depressing i don't wanna want to face this  we have to confront the state of the world   and then get on with the business of doing what has to be done  to try to s make it ah continue to be habitable  but you don't have to listen tape cuts out very briefly  what i say  you can verify it for yourself  there's a very simple way   just ask your elders  ask anyone who's seventy or eighty years old  what was the world like when they were children   all around the world our elders are a living record of the enormous changes taking place within the span of a single human life  and by simply projecting that change that has occurred during their lives into the future you know with absolute certainty that our grandchildren will have drastically reduced opportunities and enormous and unprecedented problems that we have left them   yet in response to ecological warnings and the call for the need for radical change we continue to hear denial   we continue to hear rationalization   we continue to be uh assaulted with expensive multinational corporate p r with character assassination and downright hostile opposition   it's as if we're in a car that's heading at a brick wall at a hundred miles an hour and everybody in the car is simply arguing over where they wanna want to sit   we're not seriously discussing slowing down or changing directions  we're debating about whether that brick wall that we see is real   i wouldn't mind as much if i wasn't also a captive passenger in that car   every generation occupies a brief moment in time bridging all those that have passed on before them to with  all of those of the future unborn generations   north american aboriginal people speak of reflecting back on seven generations of their ancestors and ahead to seven generations of their children and only then do they make a decision   today the primary global competitors on earth are the nations of the north plundering the planet's resources to support  enormous mindless uh sorry economies mindlessly  committed to growth and hoarding the vast bulk of the world's wealth  while producing most of the toxic pollution   having wantonly squandered and compromised our natural resources  we now demand that countries in the south do a better job yet we plead poverty to avoid m a more equitable distribution of wealth  resources and appropriate technology and refusing to cut back on our own consumptive lifestyles   yet there is a massive treasure trove to be mined that's available to all of us and that is the global military budget   when a country is dragged into war we don't have  hear economic or political justifications for not responding   well we are in the middle of the mother of all battles  the fight to keep this earth habitable  all we need is vision leadership and courage to take the first step   who can best challenge us to get our priorities straight  i believe it is the most important group of people on earth our children  and i'd like to take this opportunity to let you hear from some of them from four of them who in fact made me come here in the first place  i wouldn't have come here if they hadn't demanded that i came as their chaperone  so i'd like to introduce you then to four girls who would like to give you their impressions of what the problem is audience claps  mic thumping   okay  hello i am severn suzuki from the environmental children's organization  we are a small group of twelve year olds from canada who are trying to make a difference  we've raised all the money to come here by ourselves because we have to speak to you adults to change your ways   future generations cannot speak here so i am speaking for them   the cries of starving children around the world are not heard  so i am speaking for them   the countless animals who are dying across this planet i am speaking for them too and we can't afford not to be heard   i'm afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in the ozone  i'm afraid to breathe the air because i don't know what chemicals are in it  i used to go fishing in vancouver with my dad until just a few years ago we found the fish full of cancerous tumours   and now we hear about animals and plants going extinct everyday vanishing forever   did you have to worry about these things when you were my age  think about it   this is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions  in my lifetime i already know that my children will not be fishing in the waters of vancouver   i'm only a child and i don't have all the solutions but i want you to y realize neither do you   you don't know how to fix all the holes in our ozone layer  you don't know how to bring the salmon back up a dead stream  you don't know how to bring back an animal now extinct  and you can't bring back the forest that once grew in a now desert  i am asking you if you don't know how to fix it don't break it   here you may be delegates of your corporations organizers reporters or politicians but really you are mothers and fathers  brothers and sisters aunts and uncles and all of you are someone's child   we are all a family five billion strong in fact thirty million species strong and borders and governments cannot change that  we are all in this together and should act as one single planet  for a single goal   in my anger i am not blind and in my fear i am not afraid to tell  how the world how i feel  in my country we take so we make so  much waste  we buy and throw away buy and throw away and yet northern countries will not share with the needy  no even when we have more than enough afraid to lose some of our wealth afraid to share  if all the money spent on war was spent on finding environmental answers and agreements what a place ear this earth would be  at school even in kindergarten you teach us how to behave in the world  why can't you do what you teach us  where are our examples  you teach us to clean up our mess not to fight with others  to work things out to respect others not to hurt other creatures  to share not be greedy   parents should be able to quell their child's fears by saying everything is going to be alright  we're doing the best we can or it's not the end of the world  until we start to change i don't think you can say that to us anymore  please think of us  thank you audience claps   i challenge any world leader to look me straight in the eye and say yes we're going to make a difference  my name is vanessa and i'm a part of the environmental children's organization eco and i'm here today to express to you how concerned i really am about the environment  it's important for me to ask the politicians that they're not going to throw my future out the window  coming up h up here today i have nothing to lose except my future  losing my future's not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market and no one will be speaking for all the unborn children who will have no voice here in rio  the the decisions made and unsaid will not just affect this year but many generations to come  this conference will not just affect us but children all around the world  we as children are not easily heard but our opinions are just as important of those of mul mister mulroney and mister bush  i would al like to remind the world leaders who they're making their decisions for them or us  who are going to be living in the next generation  thank you audience claps   spanish comments   my name is michelle quigg   i was born in canada and i've lived there all my life  i am also part colombian and have been fortunate enough to have visited colombia several times  i would like to share with you my impressions of the contrast between the two countries  in canada we live the privileged life with plenty of food water and shelter  we have watches computers television sets cars that make our lives easier  every day i wake up and go to school knowing that when i return home i will there will be food on the table  as a child i don't have to worry about having enough to eat or somewhere to sleep  often those children living the privileged life are concerned with trivial things perhaps the latest styles or toys  then just ten hours south of canada in colombia i feel  like i'm in an entirely different world  there i see children my own age living on the streets with the fear that they will be murdered by officials during the night  children begging for money  nine year old boys carrying bricks and planks of wood too heavy for their young bodies to support  children filling potholes and shining shoes  living in houses of bags and roof shingles  while flying on the airplane into rio i saw the favelas  brazilian slums countless shacks with no clean water or sewage treatment which in canada we take for granted  i can't stop thinking that these are children my own age  that it makes a tremendous difference where you are born  that i could be one of those children living in the favelas of rio  i could be a child starving in africa or a victim of war in somalia or a beggar in colombia  it just makes me realize how lucky i am to live where i do  it doesn't matter where we live children are children with the same hopes and fears  in colombia many starve yet in canada people are overweight from eating too much  we engage in activities such as pie-eating contests where people stuff themselves with food they don't need meanwhile millions of innocent people suffer from malnutrition
