 mm hmm  utterance   mm hmm hmm   i cannot unders yes and and  th the the parents  on the street on our street they speak very slowly and very nicely to me so i can understand them and eventually we start talking in english because laugh just out of trying to communicate e effectively   laugh   mm hmm  and i cannot understand what the children say at all  i h i don't understand one thing that any child o on the street says and i don't understand why  mm hmm  but their their voice is  different it's it's it's squeakier   you you know   mm hmm mm hmm   and th they talk very quickly and uhm i don't understand a word so i'm kind of odd when martha goes up and  she can she can understand and bat it back and forth with these kids  and i think as as uh marmaduke  said you know if i went to a lot of french courses i'd s  i have this feeling that i would still come back and still not understand all these kids word   they have all that academic stuff   word mm hmm mm hmm   that's right yeah   is there uh just going back to the document for a few minutes i'm just thinking is there  something uhm specific that you wanted me to do for y  for the committee in terms of uhm uhm  word this school helping to uhm put together a position paper in other words  mm hmm sure   mm hmm   kay okay   uhm cos i understand that what you've done now is a draft uhm and it's out there for consultation at this point  mm hmm   yeah  and on the twelfth we'll be getting back together again   hmm   mm hmm   uhm and we'll be expecting people to come forward with suggestions and submissions   absolutely   okay  and do you have an idea what you're looking for what kind of feedback you're looking for from people  i want to know if what is on the paper reflects what you want to retain because really what this paper is about we've already handed into the board philosophically what an  &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re is and why we hold it so dear  all of us hold it so dear  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  but when it comes to our school if we are relocated   what is what is near and dear to us  what do we want to tell the board that that   we ask that you you take into account  mm hmm   and it's very important to us in trying not to alter for us  mm hmm   and so that list what i would like you to do uhm   an and you would be a wonderful help in this is to look at that and to see if there's anything left out or anything just not said as effectively as it could  do you know what i understand uh  what i mean   okay   and if if anything is  uhm anything isn't right if you would let me know before the meeting that would be great  okay   do you wanna want to go through it now  we can if you want  i've got a rough draft upstairs if if uhm if  i can just unhook   yeah   that okay   yeah   okay that would be great short tape break   i'm gonna going to  i'm gonna going to read it  just because it's one or two words   okay   okay  we the &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re  fatima hopefully it'll be orientation school and home and school committees  mm hmm  this is being sent out to members of all committees so they all have a chance to see it  mm hmm  have listed uhm the uhm i i  changed that from basic requirements to primary requirements of our school in the event that relocation of our population is considered by the leedsman school board  we look forward to working closely with our board if our school is affected by relocation  point one a building centrally located to our population  a fatima building situated between spruces  boulevard and churchill boulevard would be geographically and uhm we're also adding north of highway thirty word  would be geographically appropriate for our clientele  mm hmm   mm hmm  so not hitting them between the eyes with it but just saying  mm hmm   word for them  uhm a relocation as a unit of a current student body  we would continue to be an &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re  comprised of both eligible and non-eligible students   we wanna want to be sure that  there is no problem with the eligible students continuing to go to the school  especially if an uhm if   the neighbourhood school concept is brought in and there's uhm early immersion that we still are allowed to uhm go and be bussed   to our school  mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  keeping our current &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re fatima staff that includes teachers administrators support staff word   uhm let's see  keeping our school name as &eacute;cole premi&egrave;re fatima   mm hmm  uh facilities miss elizabeth helped out with which allow for extended kindergarten daycare music room specialist room classes with windows and non-crowded environment  something about taking into account the needs of our special uhm uh all the children but especially the special needs students really need breathing space  mm hmm  okay  mm hmm  and then ha ha  just uh uh et if i could just interject here for a second   mm hmm   sure   mm hmm   uhm i'm just wondering uh how many how many children in our school population have special needs and should we be identifying that in this particular letter  we've not   no  i don't know and that's a good point  you know for attention deficit which is a  a specific need is just five and that's not a lot of the population  i don't know if there are other specific needs that are being addressed  i imagine oh i know they're not because i've  i've seen seen kids with different needs  mm hmm   but uhm yes that's a good point   that's a good point  you can see even you see this was this was uhm o some of the old drafts  i'm not even sure if i may have even taken that off so you'll see  in in whatever that comes out whether that's on  if it's on it's a good point to bring up  mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  kay okay   notification the last point uhm and this was changed a little bit but this is the basic gist of it  notification uhm of if there is notification  of uhm of closure of our building  we want to know well before the time that the actual closure would take place and at the same time that closure is notified we also want to know which building we are being moved to  and that the reason for this is that we want to give this information to our population and prepare everyone for their relocation without uhm oh i don't know  to ensure for a smooth transition  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah   yeah   and and and also i added something about uh this'll make sure that our e p p the our e p p   parents uh feel secure about the situation and part of the process  that type of thing  so that they're you know they're they   know what's going on all along  it'll be very hard on people to h oh by the way we're closing your school and then well the school building which to people are their is their school and uhm i you're left hanging in mid-air so so  to uh not do that  mm hmm   and then a closing inviting uh some  some sort of closing to say again that we we wish to   we wish to look forward to uhm uhm a   a good uhm resolution to to this type of situation with the board and we look forward to working with them  on it  something to say that we're willing to to  go halfway on this  we just  we wanna want to cooperate   however give us our needed time and  and you know keep us keep us  in the position where we feel that we can we can help you to make a difference to make people happy  yeah   yeah   e   that's it  uhm   cos we're both winners if it comes out that way huh  yeah   there's something that that came up as you were talking about the advance notice  uhm i've had some experience in this in that  the daycare that uhm kathy went to as a young child uhm  relocated uh and and it was r  it was a really tough decision actually because the daycare had only been in existence for about two years  when the building was slated for demolition  mm hmm   oh my  and uhm we were uhm we were   all a little saddened by it and yet we all saw it as a positive move   because the location that we were now being offered was bigger and better  mm   hmm  uh bigger uhm in the sense of spacewise uh and also uhm outside the building the uh the playground area was much much bigger so there were a lot of really great plusses to it  uhm better in the sense that uhm we felt uhm it was a more homey kind of atmosphere that we were going to be moving to although it was uhm a a  duplex uh that had been renovated  uh huh   mm   the other duplexes in the area were all university buildings  mm hmm  and so there was a degree of not commercialism but i guess institutionalism uhm on the street you know   mm hmm   mm hmm   uhm and it was a very short little space so uhm it didn't have that homey feeling  mm hmm  and then we went up against opposition of uhm our local residents of our new building who did not want the daycare to be situated on their street  mm hmm   not in my backyard syndrome and uh  i just find that amazing for a daycare   mm hmm   i mean it's it's   well i i just find it surprising that people are are as uh contrary to  word this this whole idea  it's hard  it's   mm hmm mm hmm it is   we just hear on the news now about what's going on about the daycare  mm hmm  yeah there's one right now that uh i think one of the canadian uh government officials wrote a letter on uh government stationary word uhm   laugh yeah   yeah the the residents thought we were gonna going to be ripping up and down the streets with our cars dropping our children off at all hours and  you know  hmm   ah in in reality i mean  we've really blended into the into the  community quite nicely and uhm and   we've we've had some interesting uh uh get-togethers with the community and invited them to come and visit and we had an open house and they could come in and tour the  facilities and what not   i would think so   mm hmm   and i think that was a very positive experience and  and that might be something that we have to look  at  and also uhm  mm hmm   that's a good idea  so we tried to we tried to look at it from the community's perspective   mm   and we tried to look at it from the children's perspective  and then so well in advance we explained to the children that the building was going to be taken down uhm but it was for a positive step because they were going to be building a new high school and it was really important for the boys of this particular school to have the space that they needed  and so we tried to encourage them to understand uhm the process a little bit more  mm hmm  so that when they saw the being the building being torn down if it came to that that none of them would be frightened  mm hmm  and so we had to prepare the children and we had to prepare the community that we were moving into and we had to prepare the parents of the children who were also whose lives were also being affected by all of this   how did you affect the community  how did we   how did you let them know to take away some of that anxiety that they had  uhm probably uhm uh th the uh  the most uhm difficult thing to do actually was to have a meeting with the community  we invited uhm everyone on the street to come and uh meet with us  and it was a somewhat antagonistic uh meeting  mm hmm  uhm a lot of people came with with  uh padded agendas and lists of complaints and ideas  mm hmm   and what we did was that we basically just tried to handle the questions one on one uhm gently uh and with a with uh a a strong degree of tact   and and   mm hmm mm hmm   uh e we tried to uhm we tried to impress upon them that we were of a cooperative nature and so if there was something that they were really opposed to that we didn't feel was something absolutely necessary then we were c going to accommodate them  mm hmm  uhm so what we did was they were very concerned about us driving up and down the street so we agreed that we would not use the front doors of the building  and we designed the building so that people would have to come through the campus and park on the campus parking lot facilities and come in through the back door to eliminate s  the additional stress on the street that they thought  that they were going to have  oh oh   mm
