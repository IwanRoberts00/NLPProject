 december ninety-two and   i might have that one  what's the title on it   ya so these ones i don't have  beyond duration a couple words    so maybe if you could sort of get   get   that one here   kay okay/+>   ya  i'm i'm quite sure i do have that one then   so i'll i'll make a star there  and also this uh volatility and yield curve   it's a short piece by liverman   uh i went through this paper but i i  don't think that i made a made a   copy of it and i guess it'd be worth worth  having as well which word   two or three words   word which is   this is the latest one   it's also from the same journal  they're all from the same  journal   okay ya   ya i have two or three from the journal of fixed income so i think i have this one as well   so i wa i i can give you copies of both of those  ya asap as soon as possible  certainly  uhm like today if you can or if you can fax   em them if you've got em them    uhm   i think i can do that  sure   and what other things uh can can  we say   uhm uh the bottom line is measuring the the  performance  and how you can measure the performance you could say well you could look at the mean square error or the mean absolute error of the forecasts and uh   mh hmm   you might wanna want to do a market timing test   right  if you're f if you're forecasting  this is what the duration is of this sample uhm say well well that's the proportion that your uhh duration model says you should take a position say that's long or that's short and i can give you the program that i wrote for the henrickson-merton procedure  mh hmm   and i wrote a program in word  that does it  kay okay/+>   and that's that's in our new paper that's coming out in the journal of futures markets   i just got the gallies uh yesterday and they said  i i took a look at the letter it says  laugh please respond within forty-eight hours   it's one of these things that okay here you've got all this other nonsense that's going  on and then there's a deadline of forty-eight hours you know  laugh   uh huh   that's why you gotta have got to  pose deadlines cos that's how you get things done  so i dropped everything and was here at midnight last night getting in the the proofs  right   but cough uh you've got a copy of this paper have you the one we did on mean reversion cos i think you have an earlier version  okay ya i do i do   the the latest version   the version's that's going into the journal does some hendrickson-merton tests for market timing  mh hmm   so we're saying we're we're  gonna going to forecast what it's going to be   well let's and it's gonna going to give us a decision rule right  mh hmm   we go long or we go short   how what do you use for your forecasting  is it like ah ah an word or   no the the forecasts here are based on filter roles that say that well if we got  uhh if we're outside the range then go long  if we're or go short   cough   okay  is it is that is that uhm a well-established decision rules or can we mess around in the decision rules  well what decision rule have you got in mind   cos i cos i actually i did   some research on sort of ah technical rules uhm and i used the moving average crossovers and trading rules like that uhm  cough versus naive uhm positions in uh a ten year  bond and i actually came up with ah a hodrick-prescott filter uhm which uh is a or which outperformed   the the moving average technical trading rules uhm  uh huh   uh huh   now does that fit into the duration estimation or  no   uhm no it's only it's only a a   well then forget it   okay  ya so let's just focus on what we can do with the duration   uhm as opposed to a technical role cos we wanna   want to keep it narrow enough  okay   go in too many directions cos when you start  going in too many directions you end up going no place  right  okay okay   okay  so let's keep it pure and simple  let's just   okay  so i i can get a copy of this as well   you want a copy of this latest  word   laugh i i do  have the old one uhh somewhere   the old one the one that's coming out with the corrections i can give you a copy of as soon as we finish here  okay   and the breeden one you don't have so i'll give you the breeden one  in exchange what you'll do is you'll go out and get me the  the missing pieces that i put stars on here  right  uh so what else is cooking  you're you're taking a break from g d a to finish  they're going to give you the permission or   uhm ya  my we haven't basically my boss said  uhm he'll give me two weeks off to go all out and try to finish the thesis  uh so i said well it might be better off   is this your vacation time  uh no it seems to me it's going to be sort of work time  okay   so uh i mean cos he's the   stuff that i'm going to be finishing is actually going to be of use when we run a new product  uh huh  we'll probably publish uh empirical durations or something like that  uh huh   uhm cos uh c l k uses that  uh huh   they they publish empirical durations and they're sort of the street masters on empirical durations  uh huh   people listen to them  so we could probably do something better than  what they do obviously  uh huh   but the way i i what i w  what i told him or he told me i could have two weeks to do you know whatever  i said okay i'm going to talk to doctor fister and see if it's better two weeks off or maybe three days get you some stuff and get some feedback to you and then another three days later on uh things like that  well you know the deadline for graduation is when  see what it takes   uhm i've missed the application deadline  i'd still like to uh ya to me ya to me it's not important to which   graduation date it is uhm cos it taxwise  i i'm better off cough  but i would definitely like to have it fin  finished you know like before you know the  end of spring   ya if it's june or whatever   april fifteenth that's what you're going to try to finish by  that's what you were going to say   that would be perfect by me and even sooner if it's easier  but uhm  so you've got your lit review  here's what  you've got your methodology  cough   you're going to lay out methodolgy and data   the data and then results  five the results  is that   it involves something outperforms  your new empirical duration model works better  okay right   or new empirical duration model with all the complications on it works worse  you know whatever the the   data  shows   mh hmm okay   now how how   uhm   it better work better actually laugh   laugh cough as ya   cough well the preliminary one said it worked better so  it comes down to  well you can say it comes down to it  you know you report what's what's  correct right   ya okay  what what's would be sort of standard for adjusting hedge ratios and things like that  like i'm using weekly data  the salomon data i have is weekly   uhm is there any reason i shouldn't adjust the hedge ratios weekly  well that's the question  are you looking at hedge ratios or are you looking at duration that's the basis of the hedge ratio  or sorry  well like i i'm saying okay the duration say it's four years i take the mor  mortgage or the uh treasury duration i hedge  appropriately to either targeted duration or to neutralize my duration risk  uhm the next week say instead of the duration being four years it's three point eight do i readjust my treasury's hedge or do i just carry it to a specific horizon   ya  that's uh ki i mean a and then   then it  gets in to minimizing your transaction costs   uh   cos if you roll over every day it's expensive  that's right   right right   and what we we do in this paper is we say h here's the duration that's whatever it is   here's the ratio and we'll just run through it  fixed on this trading strategy  right   it may be different but it's uh uh not  gonna going to be worth your while i don't think to go every day  right   would it be   and it's just a question of  you know the the holding period in most of these studies is a week right  okay  so act actually   so that would work just fine because uh we get new duration estimates each week uhm from the salomon  uhm some of the other stuff is monthly unfortunately  i i'm going to see if i can get some uh  b weekly duration estimates from uhm uh morgan stanley when i go down there maybe even salomon   uh but i'm betting on weekly being about the best i can get  uhm cough and i've got most of the data already in  rats uh ready to run stuff  so that's a nice thing   mh hmm   i don't have to wait waste months working on data so  uhm but as as far as ahm sort of latitude of of empirical duration should i just stick with de rosa and maybe one other empirical duration measure and then compare it with my three or four wall street duration estimates   and then a few words   so you're going to get wall you've   got wall street duration estimates  right   you see that's the thing is that breeden's also got these new comparisons right with the some  empirical models  uh okay   the question is uhm   now the easiest thing to do and a parsimonious way of approaching the problem would be to   re refine the the de rosa and i thought that that was what the strategy  was going to be   mh hmm   right  oh definitely definitely  and that's why i'm saying a uhm   ya cos the wall street   ya if you get the wall street estimates right he's done it  already  and he shows that while they have some   some value these brokers' forecasts but at the same time right what goes into these things is right survival curves uhm the p s a   aging curves   mh hmm   mh hmm   right  so it's a lot of uh assumptions about lifetime prepayment rates that are  right   you know everybody's got their their   assumptions here and uh you need ah a heck of a lot of information  here to develop just this one part of uh  the broker's approach to getting the final number of  of the duration  mh hmm   so uhm and we don't want to do that because right   well i've already i've already  got their duration  i i was thinking of just you know using that as their black box   ya you could use that as a  benchmar benchmark as one of the benchmarks  with the with the de rosa and that would be i think very good  right   okay  uhm so do you do you think it's a good idea then to sort of go the way you've you've done  on yours whi which is   which is just uh doing a splining finding of the uhm price yield ratio which   ya well we just did it  that's that's what we did  and we can say what's what's the point of doing it  that's correct   is the the point to do is that it makes some sense although the  though in that this/=> book by  jayman that just came out  this guy used to be a teacher of mine at the university of pennsylvania many years ago uhm he a  really great econometrician but sort of he disappeared  mh hmm
