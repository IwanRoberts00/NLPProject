 might as well  yeah  mm  n they're good they're very good   quality  mm hmm  possibly hand-woven  mm no i don't think so   mmm   mmm signs of feet there   it's probably foot-woven  okay  here  yes   ahhh  and that is word   bowlin bowling shoe bag  no  mm uh  since i don't bowl   a dollar   mm ya  oh  uh something which uhm   uhm hmmh   hm word   i i when i w  was told yes you can go to uhm er simon fraser  university you know when simon fraser phoned back saying yes there are positions still places open so that you can go uhmmmm  because the uh the deadline was the fourteenth of april    mm hmm   mm hmm   uhm and in fact uh payment is due tomorrow  however i was told  no there's one or two words   oh dear   yeah they always make one or two words    uhm what happened was that uhm i started thinking about people i know up there  i actually know quite a few  oh really  yeah   i mean uh professional friends and uh  well you don't see the relatives if you're going to see them   well i don't know  i may see where they live uh probably two names  it'd be better not to see them there  mind you if you're there for two weeks  ya i i i'm going to go out and say  i'm not here   laugh   yeah hmm well  okay anyway let's concentrate on this  word   okay there is all this stuff huh  yeah  this is very good for cutting bread  yes it's   do you have a knife like that  uh we do have a serrated knife but th   i know this is very good for cutting bread  ah it was grandma's  yes it's a very old one  oh we have to face the uhm mics  yeah  ah so y you can have it if you want  because a y you cut   laugh a lot of bread  yes we cut a loaf of bread a day  so uhm   so why don't you take it  mm hmm  okay clears throat   now what about these mart   well no  i th w we have half a dozen  we have eight  eight  that are similar to those  do you  yeah  okay   so those can go   so how much do you think each  uh for something like that probably you could get fifty cents each  yeah that's what i was thinking too  huh whispered   okay uhm  now oh  there's there's actually two kinds  of gas plates of glass plates   now do you have any glass plates  you mean clear glass  cl clear   yeah like these  no  do do you need any or want  any  uhm   uhm i think it would be up to them to decide  you know yeah  yeah   if you don't have them i think it's because she decided not  well why don't you ask  mumbles okay end mumble 21 seconds of silence   mmmm  oh yes   well come on pick   mm well  oh that was good word   ah yeah  there's another bottle of it  mm   yes yes  would you like another bottle laugh   no only half  no   no laugh   yes exactly  okay now these plates   it struck me that it might be a good idea to save them   yeah now uh  do you have you have this set don't you  no that's it  that's it  that's that's what's left  that's that's what's left  good lord  i think that she   what happened   i think she gave some uh sent some  to the salvation army i think  no because that was the entire good set  oh no no no that wasn't the good set  that was the working set that we had early on  very that was their first set after they got married  oh  yep  mm cos i remember it being hauled out uh for uh when we had company  and maybe this is it what eight or ten or twelve  two words you know so   hmm   maybe anyway i think we should keep em  them   yeah  this uh this too should be kept  a i think cup   no it's not it's just glass  no it's just glass  oh no it's not no  it's just glass mm   and in fact it's chipped  mm  so it's no great deal  it's it's in fact i don't  think we'll even sell it  mm   we can always try  puffs breath out laugh   put a dollar on it  twenty-five cents  oh twenty-five cents  yeah mm   mm  mm hmm  this is amazing you know  this is the only example of kind of uhm rough - thrown pottery that i think maeve had  do you what that is   two or three words china   do you know what it is  no  it's not the only example clears throat ah because i've got one or two like this  they're ginger jars  ah  that's the way ginger used to come in these  so actually it's a uh it's an  interesting antique  mm hmm  well i i was thinking this   this word as well three or four words   yeah that's right   this one in particular  and uhm  and there's a big one upstairs i   a nice one as well  yeah er i kind of don't like to just ship those off  no no no no   you know i don't  no particularly something like this which says that it's  grand medal of merit ghana eighteen seventy-three   and the only prize medal for marmalade london eighteen sixty-two   probably indicates that it wasn't made yesterday   well i dunno don't know   well contents one pounds nett and  nett is spelt with two ts   uh anyway i think that we should probably keep those  no   no i think we should keep those  uh where are you putting the things   now what about this   well yeah i think it it it's   antiquey as well  it it it is   yeah it is antiquey exactly  yeah  oh okay about 22 seconds' silence   okay now these are funny little things ah dishes   mm yeah   yeah i don't recall having seen that  before  well she never really used it  no  it's it's   this is stuff we some of this stuff we went through when she left the apartment  hm  and we didn't want it so uh word   yeah it's a a nippon  crockery brand which makes it antiquey  that's right   hmm  that's right  what it's worth who knows  well  it's got a crack in it i think  well charge high  it's got a crack  yeah but nonetheless  early japanese china  yeah     hm   it's a candy dish i think  it's a candy dish that is not clean  really  up in there  put your finger in   ughhhh   oh yes  oh dear  alright   uhm okay   we'll have to uh put it aside for the time being   how much  i'd put a high price on it  well   like what  ten dollars  no pronouced 'noooooe'   yeah sure  point out that it is genuine antique  you think   i don't know what this stuff goes for at sort of at   uh antique stores  yeah well i know   do you know  i have no idea  no me neither   so if you get it uh  jude there was somebody who put this  for the equivalent of approximately seven dollars two drawings in barcelona  we wanna want to get rid of this stuff   they were both authenticated as being by picasso  mm hmm  they are each worth approximately seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars  start laugh oo go end laugh   laugh   there was probably no capital gains tax  on that one word   laugh   okay what about this huh  what is that  it's a  it's a nondescript  it looks okay if you if you like that partic   if you you either like it or don't like it laugh   ah this too is uhm   nippon  no it isn't  it's three crown china germany   uhm   it i dunno don't know  it may it may have come from madelyn   it's an antique too   well it may have  i don't like it and i never did  n it's it's a kind well it's it's uhm   it's a kind of finish that actually is quite expensive you know  is it  yeah  cos of the uhm  pearlized effect   yeah   yeah   yeah   yeah   coloured pearl effect  yeah so what should i put on that  i don't know  jan might like it actually  or has she seen it  word she's seen it yeah  the the ib the  word   no th the reason why  i i i mention that is because uh  jan's mother was buying things like this at one point when she was  uhm still buying things and uhm  this sort of stuff actually had a very good price er the stuff with kind of mother of pearl  oh really  yeah yeah   oh   oh  two or three words if you hold it to the right angle to the light it looks like its silver ran  out  oh it's possible  i i don't know how that's done exactly  no  i never liked it for some reason so uh  hm   no it's it's better  jan has seen it  uh er she made the decision you can only keep so much  yeah er well y you  can hm  so   yeah  okay  and so   i i would put something like five dollars on it  okay  uhm cos it's in stre it's in perfect shape   yeah true  uhm it probably you know predates world war one  yes it's it's possible  word   mm yeah   oh uh northwest uh airlines previously northwest  word [ sounds like emporium] is now running out of ottawa word points west  oh yes  what points i don't know  and i saw an ad for a certain period of time  to ottawa to edmonton three hundred three dollars  okay what about these little things  yeah uhm   these are knick knacks  yeah whatever   fifty cents  yeah fifty cents   i mean the fact is   actually th th     word that's another   well that's made in japan but it's not nippon  yah   yeah october something eighteen sixteen   two or three words two kilograms  whispers yeah made in japan ends whisper   uhm both made in japan in fact  yeah mm  uhm   clears throat   fifty cents each two or three words mumbled  word   okay twenty-five cents for that little  basket   yah sixteen seconds of silence   okay  do you have uhm glasses like this  n   because i thought maeve had six   and there were only three  hm thirteen seconds of silence   i have some glasses but i don't think they're similar to that  you know at one point she had some glasses uhm in the cabinet over the uh stove and i forget what it was uhm  it was when jan and i were word at one point  and we drank something out of them  and it tasted an incredibly musty   oh no  those those were different glasses  mm hmm  ah she got rid of those  yeah good  uhm is this the crack that you were talking about jude  uh the crack  this  no  in your wall   i wasn't talking about a crack was i  no no uh the other day you said uh the crack in your wall that was word   i've a few like that actually  yeah well this isn't plasterboard this is  leather   yeah i know yeah  oh yeah  oh no no oh yes no what i told or 'talk'? speaker said [ tol] you about is outside it's not that  no no no no  a few words   no no   cos this could be spackled  oh i know  ah it's not that at all  okay what about this measuring cup  no that can be sold seventy- five cents fifty cents  really   really  yeah  the pyrex  i realize they're a dollar fifty whatever you want to put on that but no we don't need it thank you  uhm   yes   you know whatever you think you can get for it  but they're probably about two dollars two fifty  for a new word   well i think   i never ever go to garage sales so i have no idea  well how much are they now  i have no idea  i don't buy things exasperated laugh   really  well true true  w what about this  no  should i save it  no  yeah well no i i mean you could  yes you could sell this  it's uhm   should i save it for the kids  no   okay uh ten cents  ten cents yes  word it seems to have a little bit of dirt in the word   hmm  minus the dirt eight  okay what do you think uh fifty cents  fifty cents a dollar  i i don't know two words   seventy- five cents  i think that might be i think that might be a good price for it  hmm   is this uh glass you think or crystal  it's uhm   i think it's crystal but uh what cut
