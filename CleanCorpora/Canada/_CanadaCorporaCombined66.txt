 and the other funny thing about that was i don't know whether i told you on the phone or not but uhm kim brought us in and made us coffee and suzy came up in her dressing gown from downstairs and i thought oh god brian 's gonna  going to have a fit  you're gonna going to be so uncomfortable  and i asked him in the car  i said well i he said i was  wondering whether they were married or not  i couldn't remember what he had told me laugh   who's what who is he to talk for   goodness sake about people being married or not married  laugh i know   well he he he they're so straight   poor brian   must get that from his father  i don't know   maybe his wife  laugh well that could be  mhh hmm   she still has the girl's rooms and the boy's rooms   so there's the uh that's that stuff   who's fiore  is that the  that the flo florist   that's just my down payment  i have to keep all these bills  this is my wedding book you see   now the other thing we haven't got on the list  i have a list of people that i put on   i didn't do any of your family except for the kids  but i think we should have carmen roddick   i didn't put her on  we better ask her  ya   uhm what have i got  the hansons rick and bobbi   jenny polly tom and fran   i don't think any of my   who won't come  uhm maris   oh god we have to have maris   i guess we do   ya we can't can't not  maybe i'd rather go and raid her house and get all my  inheritance from my dad that word took off  laugh   uhm the adair 's  and we're going to ask sally and her boyfriend  mhh hmm  vince and jerry and arles   uhm matthew and elaine   the mcintyre 's   you gonna going to  ask the honeywell 's  they've been asked   or will be asked  brian and jeanette owen   portia and bill hayes   and i haven't talked to portia but i could scratch them off  i need word   she's coming for sure  jim and andy weston   jim and jenny honeywell   do you think they'll come up uh the weston  's  mhh hmm  for sure  really  mhh hmm   the anderson 's   word mcsweeny   definitely coming  i took the white 's off  no i think i put them back on   hanson 's i didn't put in  tom ch thompson   michael rennish   and uhm i think i didn't put elaine in  okay  so graham won't know anybody  it's no point in asking really do ya you  think  no   but that's not so much on our our   part of the list  so you feel that things are pretty well uh under control   i i have to keep on top of stuff   what's that a magazine of weddings  no that's the horoscopes  you know me   oh for gosh sakes  i i  </} was reading this in the hairdresser maybe two words   and i just thought i picked this up and i thought  we have to we have to read these  these are funny   uh here we are  what's this for  for for uh weddings or something  no no no it's just for this month  so there's mine  that's the one i read  and then i read yours   i think you're very funny   telling you you're brilliant is a waste of time because you already know that  it can be frustrating though when you try to convince the rest of the world that you're not just a one dimensionable one dimensional cardboard dummy doomed to speak only through a ventriloquist voice cough   as the moons nodes cross the axis of your third and ninth houses    whatever that is   over the next eighteen months you may find that a lot of supposedly intelligent people are just too darned narrow-minded to listen to you   well that's the story of my life  well right i thought the whole thing was   even if you swear laugh you've just gotten back from mount sinai with the latest word laugh from you-know-who  laugh   cough   oh dear  what's yours   five bucks say you probably have to restrain yourself from rolling your eyes and groaning when well-meaning friends and astrologers tell you to hang in there until saturn moves out of pisces next spring that's a laugh as far as you're concerned no matter where saturn may have been    which is saturn anyway   doesn't ma matter   it's not on here  oh it's not there  it it's the stars dear   no matter where saturn may have been you've been hanging in there since the first day you were forced out of the playpen and made to walk  in your current spiritual mood you'd laugh out loud to hear that love life or at least your sex life is far from over  well start laughing and hang in there   well  so what do you think about that huh  i'll tell you heh   ya ya ya ya ya i'm not so sure  i think it was funny  ya it is funny   anyway that was my week  it was good  it was really good i think  but you haven't talked to brian yet  i haven't been able to get him  i phoned him last night and i phoned him the night before and i haven't been able to reach him  what does he work  tuesday thursday  i didn't think he was going to work  yes  he was  yes   well then if he that would have been  the reason i didn't get him last night he was it would have been that he was at work  and i guess mindy was out  uh oh   so today's wednesday  maybe i'll get him today  it's tuesday and thursday he works   mhh hmm   i think you'll probably get through today and find out what's happening with uhm marcus   ya   now anything more you wanna want to   do about marc   i don't know what to do darling  i spoke to him i spoke to him  very briefly on the phone and  i don't think there's anything more to do   what did he say to you  he didn't really say very much   uh he was just interested to know why i was where i was  i would have thought everybody would have told him laugh   i i was obviously i hadn't seen him  he hadn't been in touch with me at all   oh uh oh i see  well did you get a chance to speak to him at the wedding  no much  no  he's uhm   according to brian   i better check that with him obviously  he's really withdrawing from the family  he's really wants to he thinks that he's got his calling now and that he's gotta got to   take up his other family and that uh he can't do that if he's got this worldly family  i see   well what can ya you do  i don't think there's   jennifer has had a talk with him  i don't think a thing   i guess and he said he wasn't going to go to the wedding or was thinking not going and apparently she got him  spoke to him   she didn't get him going   well she she said when he was talking to her he was crying on the telephone   ya but she didn't get him going  he was calling mindy to say that he wasn't coming  everybody had had a crack on him at him  except me  cos i hadn't talked to him  but it was mindy 's mother who c   answered the phone  nobody else was home  and she just took a strip off him and told him that uh she wouldn't accept any of this uh stuff  laugh   that he said god wouldn't  encourage him to come  ya   and she said god would be very very angry with you if you don't come  this is your brother and this is your duty and you're responsible to your family to come  and she's a religious person so there   she's   so he was on the next plane  hmm  but we didn't know where he was going to go after  we tried to uhm  kim wanted to take him home for a while and ron  was prepared to bring him back but he   he wouldn't have any of it   no and he wouldn't go to the reception  and he left the wedding when they came to sign the register   hmm  uh uh uh uh there's nothing more that we can do about it i guess  really   there's nothing you can do   mhh hmm   sign all the rest of the papers and the money has been released now for the word   so it can last until christmas  ya maybe three words   or shortly after   it's awfully hard to think him think him  just you know dropping out like that  out of life and out of of any contact  but i i honest to god don't know   what to do   i don't think there's anything you can do honey  can you relax about it a bit  i haven't thought about it very much to tell you the truth  uhh in the last month  no   but there it it's just it's just it's just so sad because if he  i was thinking of this lad up there who was schizophrenic and uh you know he was he was doing fine  heavy medication   but he was basically normal otherwise you know   that's really sad   anyhow   and then of course the other condition just aggravated everything  ya   hmm  how did he get there  hmpf  how did he get there  did he was he sent by someone or did he go on his own or  is this what he's asking me  that's what i'm asking you  this kid that you were telling me  i'm asking about him   ohh oh oh   ya sorry i thought you were asking about marc still  no   nah i don't know  i i think his family did  he he was quite young  i mean he'd probably be in his twenties  how old   okay  and uh i think his family uh you know they seem to be very close and in touch with him   hmm   i di didn't  really get the whole story you you know   but uh i just knew that he was on heavy medication  which they had to control there  you know what i mean  they they had to hand it out to him  but uhm   okay so hmm  what would you like to do for the rest of the  today   well uhm i'd like to maybe just dance through anything that's important in that mail  i don't wanna want to deal with it   mhh hmm   uh i don't i can't see anything that's very important   uhm i wouldn't mind a little lie down   mhh hmm  how about you  i'm very tired  ya well why don't we do that   and then go out fairly early for dinner   i was up quite early today too  not as early as you were word but uh  did i wake ya you up this morning when i called  no i but i was uhm still in bed  i was   ya no i i woke up   i'm not sleeping well  no   that's again part of the problem   and i have to do something about calling the other doctor  ya well i gotta have got to     but i think basically i'm doing okay  the i bet you've even forgotten that i was sick eh  no i haven't forgotten that you were sick   it's been a while  it certainly has   what else is what   uhh i spoke to them up there about phoenix and they thought i you know p  probably let that go for a while   ya i think so  i think so too  because its not 'it' puts you on show again  ya  i i never thought that was a good idea actually   so i think i'll uh i think i'll   let that uh  i think that's something   well it was a good idea at the time  well when you were okay but/[> i would let that go now  ya   sniff   ya   because it it feeds right in to that myth that you're creating of whatever  mhh hmm  uhm   are you gonna going to   do anything more about the uhm this week about the   church   this week   well i'll probably phone uh may tomorrow but  i you know i'd i'd rather get  the home stuff done first  the home stuff done first   that's what i that's sort of the plan   that i made in my mind when i  mhh hmm   that's why i was asking  ya uhm i before i came down  and uh  that's why why i'd just  like to get some sort of feel for it   unless there's something absolutely terribly  i don't know how janice already is but  uhm  they say it's a bit better apparently   the one terry mason 's not good   she not   not well at all  no i wouldn't think so   and she's being dreadful to the staff and that's upset  john terribly  where is she  general still isn't she   still   ya  i think so  ya  he did his rounds on saturday  and it's his one day off heh and he was just exausted and  just just completely emotionally whipped   i wonder why he felt he had to do that
