 motivation then stop it   there you go   okay  ya  right  and they may even go on eh  in short i mean word laugh  oh   in short   ya laugh   now a few words got on to  word laugh   word   alright   you could do em them twice if you want  but not   more than that   ya   you can tell that i'm trying to stop myself  laugh   in fact a few words laugh  what i really want is a say laugh instead  okay  well i hope you're comfortable with this  oh ya ya it's fine  okay  soon ya   oh there's no problem  okay  you know what that is an important thing you know   like the uh word not being related to self-esteem  ya  it's funny  ya   i didn't consider it  word ya but to me it's so obvious that it wouldn't be two or three words self-esteem   a few words discussion  and that is the trouble with it during our discussion  a few words asks us where high self-esteem needs a little bit more word defensive  like cos word know you know what i mean  they point to their own failure   uh the the significance  uh like a failure is is sig  significant maybe significant   the importance   tend to oh  depreciate the significance reading   ya  and discount the importance of goal word  reading   ya i  it's maybe my own quite a few words mumbled   discussion about recording   right  i mean it's i picked it up  about three words   i'm gonna going to go through  quick  ya i word just to get a general  feel  ya sure  okay   mhh   i'm about a third of the way down page eleven  right   so i can just say high word   do you prefer high self-esteem individuals or  individuals high in self-esteem   either way   it doesn't matter to me  cos one sounds a little bit more word   it doesn't matter  from a clinical and word perspective    i don't know why you need to bring up that absolute   word deemed almost unattainable   it's like to be honest it doesn't flow  okay  ya i just put it in so i wouldn't get caught with anyone thinking  two words that you could know yourself  well maybe you can just word it that   you seem to be coming back in  i think you made your point for the development of increased knowledge  you made your point word that it's increased   it's increased that's good enough   right   then have a sentence that says you know  at the end get rid of that one and at the end say you know  this contrasts with the assumption that uhm   right   ya that may kind a few words it   it's gonna going to be a bit harder than word   uhm ya brief exchange between professor and extra-corpus speaker   just resource   ya   it deflects uhm a healthy psychological function involving word   cut cut the  effort energy i mean probably you want to stick with resources   resources word  right  ya   ya   nice nice   you see this is much more substantial   mhh   it's much more uh substantial  orients the reader   the person has a sense as to you know the context of this where it fits into what people have thought about and so on and so forth  right a more larger picture   a much more larger picture   uh that's about it  you could footnote you know somewhere in your  in your thesis uh that that  you know the experimenter who who ran the study found that the high clarity people  were obnoxious laugh   uh huh   laugh ya ya i think i'll do that  laugh   but it could be noted laugh   she word find them irritating obnoxious  laugh ya  huh   i mean that would be an interesting study eh  i mean just to do that  ya   cos they were irritating  ya  ya just to get them  brief exchange between professor and extra-corpus speaker   maybe  uhm not sure  so i think from the beginning you'll have to say something like uhm an individual's time and a few words  to make uh uh   okay  good  who who   does that make sense   i think so   okay   cos i was trying to explain   like i was had this thought and i was trying to explain it and i tried many different ways laugh cos it wasn't coming through as intelligible you know  huh  a few words mumbled hold because some  word are the focus it's likely that they will in part determine reading   that's what i that's what i'm trying to get    that was the major   ya   that's what's going on in self-reflection so  what you come in with should influence what's going to come out  ya  ya  okay  the extent to which reading   all right   it's nice eh  ya it does feel better   ya it's like like  nice  mhh it has a flow  it has that more of a thread  and i think for the reader it's like mhh  you know it's natural development context you know   sophis sophisticated balance   good so it pulls you in sort of   you're talking about literature  you're talking about research  you're talking about you know heaven forbid psychoanalytic thinking and stuff   laugh ya really   but only in a very historical way  that's right true true   yes exactly   it's part of the background so  well i heard from someone if you don't cite freud in your p h d thesis laugh you're in big trouble in psychology  laugh   where   it just is  i don't know where i heard that but it's just this funny little sort of  gotta got to just fit freud in even if it doesn't fit your research thought  even if you're doing like you know left uh  hemispheric uh simulation of a rat  you know laugh you have to put freud in   laugh somehow ya  ya   so so you need a sentence that says   ya i'm going to look at my own thesis to see if i cited   him or not   ya you should laugh   okay   oh on page seven this individual difference thing  ya   that's where i'm trying to i was trying to take into consideration your comment about sort of  you need more of a background and so forth  ah yes   okay   maybe i went off too far  for example as an word  operational two words demonstrate themselves in terms of self-descriptive trade adjectives word to indicate the degree to which they're aligned reading   mhh hmm   nice  it works better eh like compared to that abrupt paragraph laugh i had before which is just like   two words measure period you know  nice   mhh   it might be worth noting somewhere i don't know where that the the theme that you and i have bounced around off and on for years is this issue of you know what does it mean to be  undifferentiated  for example that tra you know that without necessarily measuring clarity a lot of measures  do measure it in in in  indirectly in the sense that uh people they may me measuring in that people you know who don't have  who don't strongly endorse any  items on tra meas  measures on on you know self-report uh trade measures or whatever may in fact be uh uhm  low in clarity  mhh hmm   right right right   right   uh low in clarity   like the undifferentiated  and maybe that's where i could just  or the aschema people  exactly exactly   you know but just say it briefly  exactly   just not go into the whole detail like i did last time  that's right  so you could add that in maybe towards the end   of of general discussion of of the of the range of uh  measures you know  of the uh   approaches right   okay   uhh   that would be nice  yup  and it's kind of implicit   right  it's implicit in a whole bunch of different measures   and but here we have a real measure of the actual thing now  that's it   ya   why is it uh construct validity thing that it correlates with neuroticism  because construct validity is does the measure also tap into things that it sh does it relate to things that should be related to conceptually   right  so neuroticism  i said neuroticism or lability of mood because neuroticism is  lability of mood in that kind fluctuatingness  ya it is but it's stretch   i mean neuroticism is a lot of different things and uhm  including ah you know  mhh hmm   so how about just li lability  of mood then questioning   ya and even there it's not clear to me that  that at a level of construct validity  oh that they'd necessarily be labile   ya someone can say i'm moody   right and i'm damn sure of it  ya   i'm real i'm  word and i know it  word   so at you know at  an abstract level  okay   well maybe just the reduced awareness then and scratch the other  ya   ya   cos i mean that's what she found but i mean  you see mhh  cos she provi   the problem is that she provides a rationale for why they might be  but i'm not here you know  as i recall like in her paper she says it's for the construct validity because she presents some kind of rationale  right   then you'd need like a little stem in there that would say you know in support of the measures construct validity blah blah bl  individuals low in self-clarity report reduced awareness of thoughts and feelings and uhm   they and then in a separate sentence they also report uh greater neuroticism which is thought to be a part of self low clarity because dah dah dah   dot dot dot  exactly   okay  and that's what you'd need  right  it so if i include it it needs the rationale  ya  otherwise take it out  ya  okay   i'll see what her rationale is and see how i can  if it adds i'll definitely put it in  if it doesn't then you know  ya   a couple lines down uh that is not tied to any one particular trait that's a little colloquial  ya how do you  not tied down   that is not uh uh specific to any  one particular   right   as i try to get away from talking too abstractly and too jargony then i sometimes go to the other extreme which is to be too  you know it's hard to get that middle road  ya ya  uh this is uh  i'm so pleased  it's it's it this is fun  oh i'm glad   well i really enjoyed it  like i've been having a blast doing it  you like it   ya ya ya ya   that's great that's great   mhh   you're kind of finessing well now the  accuracy of simulation thing  mh   ya i'm trying to get away from that accuracy  word  uh   ya  i think if you could not use it at all it would be best  m'kay okay   you you mean that  which page are we on  you're on the nine now   page nine ya  right  the one place i use it   right   still still  it it just it's  it's dangerous   it stands out   okay  it's touching on all   that word priority may not correspond to to accurate appraisals you know it's just that there may be motivational   you're still pitting accuracy against motivation  uh huh   so just take the accurate out   is that what you mean  get rid of the word accuarte or even cut all  motivation   i would just cut accuracy totally  and just say look you know as you said it's a hypothesis or a belief  okay   it may or may not actually correspond  and the two may be different  mhh hmm   you know you might have uhm uhm   mhh interesting  quote mumbled   right   uh exactly  so in essence judgments of self-concept clarity reflect an abstract belief or hypothesis about the stuff that may not readily be supported by one's own experiences   that's good enough  ya  i think so  ya   and uhm  it suggests that there may be a motivational component to judgments of self-clarity or   see even there again it's like   word bring in that motivation thing    ya it's as if you're you   to bring in motivation you you it's as if you need to   right and you don't have to  you don't have to  you don't have to have no accuracy to be  motivated  that's right   okay word   it's not pi   it's not like the old affect versus cognition   right   okay  it's the two are all interconnected  right  so basically you've raised the question that well you know uhh actual experience are not linked to global judgments  right  global judgments are just that  they're kind o of   they're more abstract more  word   they're more abstract   they may or or not be tied to the person's uh exper  experience uh actual experience   experience   right   so you kind of work that through  now what i'm trying to get to  ah you just hit it  other things therefore can intervene sort of in what makes you come to your judgment which is the point of this paragraph   exactly   there may be ah a number of factors uh uh other than a review of one's experience that contribute  to you know self-clarity   ya two or three words ya   mhh hmm   so it's just one of many things  right  because you see even the selective review business comes in  like you could do like uhm kunda's motivated reasoning paper  mhh hmm   you see that that would maybe be a bridge where you could say well for one thing the reviews might  be selective   you know ah the person may particularly ah focus on or there might be a hypothesis confirmation of  of process  right   right
