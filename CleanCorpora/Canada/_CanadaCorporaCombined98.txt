 what  you can get in trouble for that  that's right  anyways when ryan talked to my mom yesterday they had like pretty lengthy talk i guess and uh   like my mom doesn't like ryan   mm hmm  but i think she's gonna going to  start liking him when he gets back   really   yeah cos i think that she kinda kind of   hit a turning point yesterday when she was talking to him  because they were talking and uh my mom told him to make sure he took good care of me when he took me to windsor for the weekend  good  but she hadn't said anything to me about whether i could go or not  well obviously it's yes  she's obviously come to the conclusion that i'm going anyway so   yeah   she also talked to him about like what he's   gonna going to do when he gets out of the military and stuff and how she really didn't want me to marry someone in the military because like i didn't know what the military was like and she didn't really want me to find out what it was like and just all this kinda  kind of stuff  anyways they talked for a while and ryan said that like ryan used to think ryan used to hate my mom   mkay okay   like she was a real bitch  and that's why they never got along because he hardly ever talked to her because he thought she was a bitch  mkay okay   and then so therefore she thought he was an asshole so it just kinda kind of went both ways right  ah geez   but um now ryan said that he realizes that my mom is just like expects a lot out of people  mm hmm  like she doesn't expect people to sit on their ass and do nothing and say yeah this is life  like she expects them to go off and do things with their life  yeah you grab them by the balls and off you go  yeah and uh she expects a lot of people like she expects a lot of me and she expects a lot of my sister and she expects a lot of her boyfriends too right  and uh he said that he used to like think that that was wrong because it's like my life and i should be able to decide what i'm going to do with it  okay  but he said he said now he realizes that you know like i'm his i'm her baby or whatever  and uh it's not like he not like she  just accepts er expects a lot out of my sister and i  she expects a lot out of herself also  mkay okay   she's taking a university course eh  mkay okay   and she's been tak she's taken   three of them so far like in nursing and she doesn't need to but she   word   cos she wants to  yeah and she's been doing really well in them because she wants to try and get her degree wi   aright all right   she's been nursing for like over over um     i dunno don't know how long like over thirty years probably   mm hmm mm hmm   and um so she doesn't need it you know but she just wants to do it you know  hmm that's good  hold on a second i just have to put lip stuff on  my
