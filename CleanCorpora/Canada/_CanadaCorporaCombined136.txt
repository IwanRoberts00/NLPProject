 you're talking a forty percent uh so-called mark-up or margin of profit which is uh fairly hefty  that's right  la presse local newspaper uh has another interesting story which is that uh it says that uh  a sergeant-detective with the m u c police has been suspended for using his service rev- revolver to shoot a raccoon in old montreal  the paper say this happened at around eleven p m on saturday night  kinda kind of reckless isn't it?  well it s- sounds like it  he wasn't on duty at the time uhm and but  he saw the the raccoon making his way behind  an apartment building where the officer lives and he shot it twice apparently  uhm then officers from station fifty- thirty-three  which is near there arrived a few minutes later and began an investigation  now the police haven't released the name of this officer and the paper says qu- and i'll quote the paper as usual information about an incident involving a member of the police force was not available   so the police are are really being quiet about this  the animal apparently disappeared after it was shot nobody's found it  uh berger blanc local animal control was called but they they looked around and they couldn't find it   yeah i think there are other ways to  to get your target practice and i don't think uh the traditional way is to go after raccoons especially ah for the precedent that it sets because there are lots of raccoons in the city nowadays   well alright   especially in the middle of the city alright  in old montreal on saturday night  ah boy  aah parizeau is back from vacation and back on the front pages in a big way today not just talking about pot but other things  he's ah accusing ah the federal referendum minister lucienne robillard of trying to organize a common front with the nine other premiers  he says the premiers are getting ready to gang up and say that they would not discuss economic or political links with a sovereign quebec  uh he says that uh ma- manitoba's   premier gary filmon was asked to lead the common front so he uh sort of came out and tried to expose this yesterday  when the papers uh contacted the premiers though they said they didn't know anything about this  mike harris says he doesn't know about it and so did some of the others  robillard is quoted as saying that this is all just a fiction invented by parizeau to make people forget what else lobsters   laugh parizeau's alleged comment that a 'yes' vote would leave quebeckers like lobsters thrown in a pot of boiling water   laugh   and  well c b c uh radio news reporter den mccouglin based out of montreal is uh looking at that story by the way  and uh if you listen to world report today you could get more on that  and uh now that parizeau is back the lobster puns have been revived  the the front page of the gazette says that lobster is back on the menu and uh that's because  laugh the issue came up yesterday at the press conference  laugh   parizeau denied saying that uh saying uh  he denied what was reported in la presse the day that the story broke  and he kinda kind of side-stepped though when uh he was asked well wh- did you mention lobsters to the european ambassadors at all?   uhm he says that the whole thing is just laughable and ridiculous and it's really just a a quarrel among journalists  sally thanks very much  you're welcome  sally salvy will be back i-  in less than an hour to talk a bit more about what's some of  the columnists are saying in the paper this morning   cam uh any impact yet?  impact not a good word  to l- to use laugh when we're talking about traffic there kyle   laugh   laugh   no no impact   no collisions  good   no  no impact so far but uh we'll keep an eye out for that   sally salvy is back as she is every day at this time with a look at a couple of the editorials in the morning papers  uh before we go to that though sally i imagine you're one of those people who is breathing a sigh of relief with a bit more rain for the garden even though we had a lot of rain on the uh  on the weekend uh there's been kind of a dry summer so  yes although the only problem with that is that you have to cut the grass  at least when it's brown it stays short and you can leave it like that  when it there's more work when it rains  laugh that's true   all that work to be done  so what's in the editorials this morning  well uh jean-robert sansfa&ccedille;on has an  a long editorial in le devoir today about the marijuana growing in kanesatake  he says that uh when the government decided to crack down on cigarette smuggling you know this is both the provincial government and the federal government   what they did was they reduced taxes tobacco taxes  they didn't really do anything about the smuggling conducted by mohawks  and so he says uh when it became less profitable for criminals in the community to uh to smuggle tobacco they turned to other products  and he says ah marijuana is not the most dangerous of the products that they ha turned to   he says that the warriors are really thugs who don't have the interests of uh the community at heart  they uh don't care about the social economic development of  of the community and that they're just uh  and the proof is that they're  they're bringing young people into the contraband trade and into the marijuana trade  he says uh and meanwhile the racism in the white community is growing against the native people  and he thinks that the situation is getting dangerous and that  the government really should do something  no question that uh this this story has exposed a problem that exists at many many levels  uh both in the mohawk community and beyond the community  and it's all about relationships uh within that community and without that community and uh uh indeed there laugh  hopefully there's uh there'll be some solutions that'll be found  well he he really goes into  he he really analyzes the kind of shirking of responsibility on the part of the the federal and provincial governments on this issue so it's quite an a   long and analytical editorial  uhm pierre gravelle has an editorial in la presse  today about the two big libel suits that were in the news last week  do you remember there was a story that uh the biggest award ever was given to uhm uh a case w- uh up-  upheld by the supreme court and in this case the  the church of scientology was sued for one point six million dollars   and the other story of course was that uh lucien bouchard is suing the popular radio host andre arthur  gravelle says that uh the church of scientology claimed at the time to be deprived of of its freedom of expression by the court's decision   yet he says the scientologists try themselves on many occasions  to use the libel laws to muzzle journalists who are making legitimate enquiries into their finances and recruiting methods so that whenever journalists were getting close to something uh about their recruiting methods or their finances they would then threaten them with a lawsuit a libel suit  uhm and he says that uh uhm it's true that the media does try to protect its own interest in these cases and does often say that uh uh freedom of ek- expression is at stake  but he says not too many uh colleagues of andre arthur are going to cry for him if he's convicted  gravelle says that uh the biggest threat to freedom of expression comes not from the courts but from buffoons and deg-   demagogues like arthur who think that they can say anything they want as soon as they get in front of a microphone  well the thing about that bouchard story that strikes me though is that i think probably would've got much much less attention  if if the suit had not been launched by bouchard  that it was a story that wasn't getting much play outside of arthur's show and uh also uh a few uh publications that don't have a widespread circulation  so it seems that the suit has brought more attention to the story which the story which obviously upsets bouchard in the first place  well and there's als- also  the amount of money it's one point four million dollars so  arthur has been sued many times in the past i don't think uh perhaps uh for that much money  sally thanks very much  you're welcome  sally salvy is here every day at this time with a look at a couple of the editorials from the morning papers and uh if you're tuning in at about six fifteen every morning she has a very complete rundown on uh what's in all the papers uh that circulate around montreal  it is uh twenty-one minutes now after seven
