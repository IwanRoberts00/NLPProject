 uhh the business tax  right  so the city has told me that it's calculated uhm la valeur locative of the place  mm hmm  depending on the square footage and everything  kay okay   and seeing as our office is gonna going to  be very similar in square footage to uhh the dentist's   except that it's like about a third of the size  kay okay   i've used his business tax as a ballpark and  prorated it  and prorated it   okay  n'i and could be 'now' i  didn't know whether the business tax was actually uhm variable like let's say a dentist would be charged more because his like income is astronomical   well two or three words square footage is uh is a good allocation basis  so that's fine the way i do it  mm hmm   okay   yep   and that i understand is payable in february and june  we won't be starting until july so i just assume that we would pay it in july  maybe half the year's portion  two or three words cash flow  yes  i'll put that up in your cash flow as an word  in june  yeah  mm hmm  kay okay uhm alright that's done  now did the depreciation of assets do you need a specific table for that or i just put in our incomes to   snort ihh depends on the extent of the assets  whaddya what do you got a car or a computer   no it's just uhh the computer three thousand dollars and the printer three hundred at the two words    well two or three words  that's fine  then you're using c uh c a  uh the total percent  yep   actually uh contributed to a hundred percent in year one  that's the only uh word yeah   yeah maybe they mentioned that in class   so maybe i sh i had done  it as fifteen so it was carried over from year to year  fifteen percent  yeah  think it's too low  well sure because you gotta got to  take advantage as early as possible  if they allow you a hundred percent and you're  word you might as well just go right at it  okay   alright  and take it and go one because it's the only category that allows for a hundred percent uh in year one  okay  now the word analysis that i did is not an accounting for a word analysis  i didn't take into account pronounced " accamp" the depreciation  d'you do you want me to  breath no  the finan   the financial break-even   the financial break-even is more uhm uh  reflects uh  the cash  right mh hmm  okay  so that'd be more important  okay   now the flow of customers doesn't seem relevant to my project   they come in the door they get the appointment and they leave  uhm am i misunderstanding what you want from this   well the flow of customers is not necessarily why they're within the confines of the building  okay  flow of customers from the point of view of uhh how do they uh  three or four words   three words   do they do they two words  appointments three words uhh  you know what's the best sort of uh payment how do they  word do they get uhh  and once they're in what's the procedure for uh processing a client  do they go in the waiting room do they you know   are they offered coffee  okay  just kinda kind of like the flow  of the of the customer through your whole system  mkay okay   breath production plan system not relevant cos i'm not producing something right  no   cos you don't have any uh any two words    kay okay   now you mentioned that in the presentation not too much verbal detail that you only wanted a couple of overheads  uhm for your presentation yeah two words  ten minute hard earned presentation  so what am i doing with this presentation  can't sit there and   uhh you you you see sigh  overheads  there's a rule of thumb that says five minute max per overhead  you know because when you put up an overhead you can  leave it for five minutes  leave it there   okay  but that's a rule of thumb  some are less some are more breath   uhh do a few overheads because you don't wanna want to clutter 'em  them   you don't wanna want to have every  if you put up your uhm income statement  i'm not gonna going to put any financials up  okay good because   maybe a break-even chart  okay break-even chart's not bad  but anything where there's a lotta lot of   clutter you're gonna going to find a problem  no they're gonna going to sleep  exactly  so we wanna want to have a hard hitting visual or something that's really high impact  okay  low words very uh you know even graphics if necessary but uh just a few uh to highlight what you wanna  want to do  okay   and go ahead with the uh the  presentation is you wanna want to do uh if you   read an o read an overview of the opportunity  and then go right into your industry research  yeah that's what i was gonna going to   do then the target market  and then the marketing  exactly  and then operations   and operations   yes and finally finance and the highlights in financing   so it's almost like highlighting the point of the business plan  it has to be in highlights because especially when you come to financing there's no way you can do a coupleuh couple of  minute presentation on financing without more or less looking at an overview  what people are interested in knowing is how much is it  gonna going to cost you to start where are you  gonna going to get the money and what are your projections for earnings  kay okay   so essentially that's the key elements in   in financing from a superficial you know high   yeah   okay cos you mentioned that you really want us just to  sell it   i'm hopin hoping to drum up some business  right  but i'm not like looking at them as if they're potential shareholders  no   you really wanna want to get them to see the excitement the opportunity to see that you really believe in it that you've done your homework and that it could work it could fly  there's some feasibility to it and just like a resume creates the excitement for somebody to say why don't you come to an interview this would create the excitement for people to say i'd like to see your business plan because there's some details i'm not sure about but the idea seems uh  word seems good on  overview  good feedback yeah  mkay okay breath uhm  now my pessimistic   i noticed in your notes that you reduced it by fifty percent like you just said what would happen if you had half as much volume as you're anticipating  right  but seeing as our current operating level is just below  no just above break-even  mm hmm  what i did was i reduced it by thirty and i increased it by thirty for the probable either way   and i didn't wanna want to get too ridiculous and chop them in half because then we're done for the year type of thing  we've already done enough business in january february and march to almost break even  okay  we'd be totally unrealistic to say fifty percent less  exasperated sigh well how many clients is that based on  what are what are you using for the criteria  in other words like given a a  probable outcome how many people per week are you expecting  how many people per day   okay so what i have now   this i had to sort of make some decisions without you  we have a present client base of seventy-five people  kay okay   approximately forty percent of those are repeat customers so they come once a week  okay  so what i've done is for my income statements i drew it up on a six month  mm hmm  uhh like  based on the seventy-five   yeah   so that i could see the determine the  feas feasibility of moving it  outta out of the house on july first  so i really wanna want to facilitate the comparison of those two six month periods  okay  so i've put on my uh cash flow that january february march are actual figures  mm hmm  and the rest are projected  aright alright and projected on the basis of what the word that you have now  what we have now and maybe a little increase because we've already seen a twenty-five percent increase since january  wow  so that's legit  cos we just started in october  so in other   you see well when i'm talking about cutting by fifty percent your projections that's based on projections from zero  okay  so in other words you're anticipating w   in your case you have some actual numbers  right  so it'd be there is no point in cutting it in half because you you uh already got  present clients  okay  so to work with that as a starting base is very very realistic  that's fine   okay  that's your top end what di i m  what is the the t because again you're limited by  how you know facilities and so on and how many you can handle per day  yeah   i included that in my maths and income statements and then maybe year three we would take on another therapist  so   oh good   you'll have to be two or three words    we have one person doing the massage  three or four words you're limited by x amount of hours a day  you can only do so many   right  mm hmm  okay   that's your point is to see like you know what would be your saturation level when would you anticipate on hitting that level so that you can start projecting for that  word extra therapist other resources whatever  how constrained   right   okay   so that's alright that i did it six months at a time  yeah that's perfect  just so that okay it is an academic exercise but the reason why i took the course was to help me learn how to run a business and he started his business in october  mm hmm right  and it's not working out great at home so i thought okay this is my opportunity to do the actual research and comparisons and come up with   mind you   so word there's a proper environment to it which means that three words   cos i didn't wanna want to   fake it and pretend that the business doesn't exist yet  mm hmm  i wasn't sure if it was really considered a startup but i spoke to laura and she said it's only three months old it's a startup business anyway  it's a startup anyway because basically uhh i mean what you're looking at here is taking it off off in a new direction  right  it's not a continuation of a business as it was in the past you actually really restarted  expanding   okay  mm hmm  so we're fulfilling that requirement  mm hmm  good breath   mmm do i hafta have to take into account his education the costs or that's just a sump cost that was done like a year ago   education the uh courses to get the uh certification all that type of stuff  yeah   mm hmm   sigh that was done prior to the business  prior to october  and the business wasn't registered until uh october  didn't register it till february  february ahh  and that is carried back within a year and then it would depend on your fiscal year  if you're  a fiscal year now has to be a calendar year to move on  oh it is eh  yeah  oh cos see you used to be able to set your own fiscal  yeah they changed that this year  oh they did oh okay mumbling   cos within the cabinet within the the   say like for example if you didn't register a business uh till october and and you'd done some activity in june you could actually carry it back as part of the business so you you'd be in that  the registration itself wouldn't hafta have to  occur in sequence  okay  you you carry back  in this case to be honest with you and especially given  the the new restrictions on the fiscal year i don't real i can't really say  okay  i would see it as a sump cost but in actuality it's part of doing the business  i mean you wouldn't be able to do the business unless you  hadda had to put out for  well maybe i should put it in startup costs and uh have it asterisked pronounced asterixed as it's something that's already out of pocket  that's possible and also too you have to c   you have to also project for it to be ongoing because you know there are upgrades and courses and learning new techniques and so on and so forth  and courses yeah   kay okay   so that should be part of your budget each year cos that's two words for training and and so on   alright   training expense i guess you could call it
