 you don't have the confidence yet as a teacher and uhm  confidence uh adds up to two things  i was talking uh over lunch  because i taught the morale enseignement de morale   you know what that is multiple audience members respond    yeah i taught in a small village and it's the parents  okay   it's the parents who say that you know you could  you c my kid instead of learning catholic for religion he can learn morale   so that i had three students audience members laugh    laugh so you have three students and  it was kind of a discussion kind of thing and uh yeah  yeah kinda kind of like this   audience member says something   that's what i'm talking about  and what it said in there is that confidence is  theory plus experience  so you have the theory now but you don't have the experience   you're just gonna going to have to kinda kind of go through with it  and and think about it and think who  who you want to be as a teacher  and remember i think what you said at first you know that you're a teacher you wanna want to be a teacher  and you had your reasons   and uh the more you you you you think about that the more your the true objectives stay there and you won't be so bogged down by all the political you know kind of thing that can happen   uhm do want wha wo do you guys want me to talk about discipline now or is uh   yeah if you like uh that seems to be a point that uh   audience member responds   would you like me to talk about discipline  what what is your greatest thing that is uh worries you the most about discipline   audience member responds   well wha wha what nothing  to think about at all  audience member responds   yeah   audience member responds   imagine you're a third year so laugh   audience members laugh   audience member responds   word   right  audience member responds   right  audience member responds   very good   right  audience member responds   okay   very good  audience member responds   okay  audience member responds   sure  okay  audience member responds   audience member agrees   well that's all gonna going to  happen   you know you that's important to understand is that like what you're worried about now is going to happen  i mean you you're gonna  going to have situations in which students aren't respectful  you know you're gonna going to have situations probably you've already had one   audience member agrees   and you will have those situations in which students pick up on that   okay  discipline is a part of life in teaching  okay  it's an ongoing thing  i think uh a it's like if you're a parent okay eh if you're parenting it's the same thing it's an ongoing thing   and a discipline problem word   that you can that you have with a group is your problem too  okay  maybe you're not responsible for it  okay i used to get upset when uh when   the school director used to you know say it's the teacher's responsibility to two or three words   i said listen i'm not the one throwing erasers you know  laugh audience members laugh   you know what i mean like there's a part but there's also a question of discipline is something you're gonna  going to have to deal with  it's the most tiring part of the job but it's part of it   and i bet you we even have it at a university level  at college level i bet   audience member comments   pardon  audience member comments   yeah laugh right   audience member laughs   you know i think it i think it's   always there that discipline kinda kind of   thing  and i believe the reason is okay   barram barra trumpet noise audience members laugh   laugh i believe the reason is   we are very we all have different ideal of what discipline is   you know i'm a very strict person in a in a  let's say in my school terms  you know with my just the fact that i'm mister scott audience members laugh   it was the first time that they've had that  in about i don't know how many years  a stu student  the teacher come in and say i'm mister scott i'm not hey andy   and that's up to you to say that  cos when you're gonna going to go for your first day they're gonna going to go what you  wanna want to be called mister   huh mumbles two words they  mumbles two words they don't mind audience members laugh   they don't mind you know  very fast sentence   what i meant is that they go  the kids they're nice you know   the kids are okay  they don't show any more disrespect than if you're mister scott  or if you're andy   and you go that's okay but i'm mister scott   you know what i mean  you have your   cos respect is your respect   they say you shouldn't be don't demand  respect they say that you earn respect  baloney audience member laughs   you ask for respect  because you're a person   you know what i mean  if a student go ugh moans in disrespectful manner you go hey you don't talk to me like that  it's not ugh   you know i'm your teacher and you are  and if you wanna want to speak to the student after you speak to the student after  you're gonna going to call p  st uh the student's parents you're  gonna going to call the parents students speaker does not say 'of the'   you know what i mean  if you're gonna going to do something you're gonna going to do it  it's tiring   it's the longest part of the job but you're gonna   going to have to deal with it  you're gonna going to have to deal with it over and over again  but what you have to understand is that a student who does something like that like oh leave me alone  what you have to understand is that okay he might be against you sometimes but quite often it's just the way that they are it's just that you don't accept it   i'll i'll give you a a  trick   something when you meet your students for the first time  a student who has you have problems with   okay   la la

board for about ten seconds   i don't know if there's two ns   is there two ns word unacceptable  pronounced inacceptable   audience member responds further audience members respond speaker keeps writing on the board   audience member corrects speaker   unacceptable   word said that  i was thinking that  unacceptable speaker finishes writing on the board   i go  there's acceptable and there's unacceptable   and what you did to me in front of the class today   okay if they did something they said word  or word or  something like that   audience member laughs   or if they say uh you know oh je m'en fous or anything like that  for me that's unacceptable   unacceptable behaviour in my class  unacceptable to me   and i want you to write a letter of apology signed by your parents for tomorrow audience members sound amazed   and then and then they go  and that's it  and they go and if they want to say something  that's up to you if you wanna want to   hear it   you said what you had to say   if they start arguing and that you say bye   audience start talking   bye  we did we talked you know  i told you what i had to say audience member coughs   you know   audience member asks a question   then you call the parents   then you write the report   i would even write the report right away  you know that they have these reports now   audience member makes a comment   yeah a fiche   if i were  oh you you say it too to johnny   yeah  that as johnny's there  you say it's unacceptable  i don't agree with what you said  i want a letter  if well no no say give me the write the letter and if you don't write the letter then i'm  gonna going to do a fiche uh   audience member comments   yeah  but i would even do sometimes i do it  right away   you know do it right away   you know say you're gonna going to get  it right away you have the fiche nothing else happens and then there's no big deal but it's done   audience member comments   audience member responds   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   okay  audience member comments   mm hmm   and what happens too is uh   audience member comments   right   well word it's yeah and and  also ye ye you    and   audience member comments  it's  yeah sure   two words it's  it's a good thing that  audience member comments   audience member comments  right  audience member comments   right   so you're even better off you know to to if  that happens even if it's the first time uh  cos the guy or girl may say something they would never ever say but because you're a new teacher they think they can  they can do it  so uh quite often you do that right away even with the  fiche word even with the s dossier  do it right away and you might not have any problems at all for the rest of the year with the student   audience member asks   audience member replies   audience member asks   yeah they know   that's the basis   audience member comments   audience member comments   you don't wanna want to  threaten them too much  audience member laughs   altogether eh  you don't wanna want to threaten them  word   audience member comments   yeah audience members laugh     cos then they're gonna going to  laugh at you audience members start commenting as speaker continues   and you're gonna going to end up writing ten thousand of them and none of it's not gonna  going to do anything  you know what i mean it's that that   balance of of discipline audience members stop commenting as speaker continues   audience member agrees   you you do discipline   you're always gonna going to have to do discipline  but you do it when it's important and you and you do it until  what what i'm trying to tell you is that   when you deal with discipline you always're gonna  going to have to deal with it   you deal with it till the end of the line   don't be don't be slack about it  you know  don't be lazy about it and go oh i talked to them and i gave him a good talking to and now he's okay you know  make the kid know that you're you're   on your job  you're doing your job  and you're going to get more respect from the other students  cos   audience member starts comment   audience member continues comment   that's right   audience member comments   yeah they're gonna going to  talk about it   that's right  i had a really good intervention this year in which i  i called a parent's student   tsk excuse me  audience member laughs   i called a parent's called a parent's student  i called a student's parents  audience member laughs   and uh sigh   they they uh   i said i'm calling
