 on today's feature report we'll try to find out what alberta's doing to prevent global warming   the irony of the greenhouse effect is that life on earth depends on a warm climate  the problem is it's a case of too much of a good thing  since nineteen sixty the concentration of carbon dioxide the most important greenhouse gas has gone from three hundred and seventeen to three hundred and fifty-seven parts per million in the atmosphere  that's a thirteen percent increase in only thirty-five years  scientists say carbon dioxide levels have not been this high for a hundred and sixty thousand years  the average global temperature has gone up too about point five degrees  this may not sound like much but the difference between now and the last ice age is only about two and a half to five degrees celsius  scientists are predicting a two and a half to five degree increase in average temperatures by the middle of the next century  i asked hubert daring of the pembina institute in drayton valley why we should worry about the greenhouse effect in alberta  speech, 1 min 5 sec   if global warming were simply a matter of ecosystems moving north perhaps the consequences wouldn't be so bad but as doctor morris sengorem of the university of calgary explains ecosystems don't change overnight  speech, 35 sec   so the climate may change enough to move an ecosystem such as the boreal forest north but the soils can't just pick up and come along for the ride  the boreal forest would essentially be caught between a heat wave and the underdeveloped soils of the sub arctic  i asked hubert daring if such outcomes represent worst case scenarios  speech, 55 sec   in nineteen ninety lucien bouchard then the federal environment minister committed canada to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand  the federal government's answer to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions is the voluntary challenge  but since nineteen ninety alberta's carbon dioxide emissions have increased by fifteen percent making alberta the largest greenhouse gas producing province in canada  jim bauer is with alberta environmental protection  speech, 45 sec   the pembina institute did an analysis of the first hundred and eighty-nine submissions to the voluntary challenge registry in ottawa and according to hubert daring the results are less than inspiring  speech, 30 sec   officials from alberta's energy department told us they're excited by the high levels of participation and that it's a question of whether the glass is half full or half empty  they say flaws in the voluntary system will be cleaned up in round two and that we have to give corporations a chance to show results  according to tim feely of alberta's clean air strategic alliance alberta's fossil fuel industries are very concerned about this issue  speech, 30 sec   but just as concern over greenhouse gases is building two of alberta's largest greenhouse gas producers are talking about major expansions  suncor and syncrude in fort mcmurray are already responsible for producing eight percent of alberta's carbon dioxide emissions  according to roland gump environmental specialist for suncor the company will reduce c o two emissions back to nineteen ninety levels by two thousand and five  this while doubling producion of oil  speech, 10 sec   in the struggle to put the brakes on global warming we know that all fossil fuels are not created equal  according to hubert daring coal produces twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas and oil produces about one and a half times as much  oil sands synthetic crude on the other hand produces ten times as much c o two as conventional crude oils says daring   this may be why some american states are so interested in alberta natural gas  if they replace coal with natural gas they could reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by as much as fifty percent  the trouble is alberta gets the c o two bill for producing the natural gas  according to hubert daring energy switching and efficiency are only part of the first step in curbing greenhouse gas emissions  speech, 45 sec   despite that fossil fuels appear to present significant and unaccounted environmental cost movements towards renewable energy continue at a snail's pace  that's it for our feature report   canada is responsible for two percent of the greenhouse gas emissions on earth  while china releases four and a half times as many greenhouse gas emissions the average canadian is responsible for seven hundred and fifty percent more emissions than the average chinese  among canadian provinces alberta is the greenhouse kingpin   not only is alberta the largest emitting province in canada carbon dioxide emissions have grown by fifteen percent since nineteen ninety   this despite canada's promise to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand   there are some glimmers of hope however  gas companies like nova are looking for ways to curb their greenhouse gas emissions   traditionally before work was done on a pipeline the gas was vented into the atmosphere  by using compressors to push the gas into sealed areas of the pipeline repair crews can now minimize the methane released while making repairs  nova estimates this one change is preventing nine thousand tonnes of methane from being released each year  methane is eleven times more potent than carbon dioxide in causing global warming   and that's it for this week's facts and trends  i'm annie gillis   jim hanley is a seasoned social and environmental activist  he organized a national grassroots campaign to protect south moresby national park on canada's west coast in the mid nineteen eighties  it was the largest and most successful park campaign ever mounted in canada involving people from coast to coast  he began this campaign after living and working with the haida people in the queen charlotte islands for almost a decade  before it was over the conservative federal environment minister of the day had kissed the earth and pledged to create a national park there   hanley later led a world tour to expose the plight of the penan people of borneo who were losing their rainforest homeland to loggers  he's traveled to more than seventy countries around the world  he is the author of numerous books including places at the edge  and a discovery a book about getting kids back in touch with the land  he spends half of his time in canada and the rest in thailand writing books and working for rainforest cultures around the world  as we in western consumer-oriented society struggle to find sustainable development solutions jim hanley has been observing helping and ultimately trying to save sustainable cultures around the globe  i asked jim hanley how he thinks canada is doing at practicing sustainable development  speech, 1 min   humans have lived on the earth for about three point five million years  for most of that time humans lived as hunter-gatherers  the population increased at a rate of about one person every five years  speech, 2 min 10 sec   hanley says we talk about sustainable forestry in alberta and british columbia but the mentawai people are actually practicing it  speech, 30 sec   the sago palm is one of more than fifteen hundred palm species in this hundred and sixty million year old rainforest ecosystem  speech, 2 min 5 sec   the mentawai culture is just one example of a so-called primitive society living and working sustainably in their ecosystem   for many of us in western society the dream of a utopian life in the serene suburbs has turned into long commutes high stress and a distinct shortage of she of leisure time  hanley's not suggeting we all immediately adopt the lifestyle of the mentawai people but perhaps their's and the cultures of others around the world can each provide a piece of the answer in our search for sustainability  next week we continue our journey through culture and sustainable development with author jim hanley   we'll find out how the penan of borneo met saks of fifth avenue in new york and how car sales in southeast asia are turning rainforests into rubber plantations  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's annie gillis with this week's ecofacts and trends   here's something a little different this week  from the recent sustainable edmonton society's striking a balance conference we present the top five future indicators of sustainability   number five  within fifteen years five percent of alberta homes have solar shingles on their roofs and they'll be producing their own heat and power   number four   in one decade ten percent of workers will leave the driving to the internet and telecommute to work from their homes   number three   after yard naturalization becomes a raging fad dandelions are no longer scorned and dozens of species of songbirds and wildlife reappear in urban neighbourhoods   number two   within a decade more community cooperatives spring up to get small grocery stores back in neighbourhoods  as a consequence local food is better marketed and more people learn the names of their neighbours  and finally the top future indicator of sustainable development is  ottawa swears of greenhouse gas emitting tar sands projects and asphalt-friendly infrastructure programs  instead the feds encourage solar power light rail transit  and the marketing of new sustainable technologies   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   last week we began our series on culture and sustainable development with an interview with author and activist jim hanley   he was the architect of the campaign to protect south moresby as a canadian national park in the mid nineteen eighties  since then he's worked tirelessly on behalf of en   the environment and rainforest people around the world  last week he described the mentawai people of seburoot in southeast asia  it's a culture that lives sustainably in one of the oldest rainforests on earth  to hanley they seem a happy and content people with enough leisure time to leave anyone in the western world aghast  today we continue our discussion with author and activist jim hanley about culture and sustainable development pipe music  in view of humanity's potential to dominate the earth albert einstein's analysis seems rather pragmatic  he said man has lost the capacity to foresee and forestall   quote continues   western society seems to have developed some capacity to foresee things  the real question remains in the forestalling department  it's perhaps why we in the so-called first world spend enormous amounts of time navel gazing and searching within our market-based system for ways of making our consumer lifestyle sustainable  but jim hanley has spent time with cultures like the mentawai of seburoot the penan of borneo and the quechua of the amazon  many of these cultures are already socially environmentally and economically sustainable  i asked jim hanley if there's anything western society can learn about sustainability from other cultures  speech, 35 sec   hanley thinks we have to get beyond the recycling stage to take seriously more challenging concepts like reduction   speech, 2 min 30 sec   in our quest to develop new markets the western world certainly seems to have become culturally imperialistic  the western consumer lifestyle's intoxicating  it's addictive  and according to hanley it's endangering sustainable cultures and mowing down rainforests throughout southeast asia  speech, 1 min 5 sec   the unbridled economic development that's racing through southeast asia today reminds hanley of canada in the nineteen fifties  in this frenzy of economic development people are not sitting around debating sustainable development  in fact hanley argues that many countries are actually moving away from sustainability  speech, 1 min 50 sec   one by one diverse and once sustainable cultures and rainforests are being swallowed in the name of economic development  speech, 40 sec   despite all this hanley remains hopeful  it will take creativity and he says some sacred notions will have to be shed along the way but there are solutions  some of which exist in other cultures  next week is forestry in alberta sustainable  join us as we try to find out if the forest and the trees will be around for future generations  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's this week's ecofacts and trends   material world a global family portrait by sierra club books demonstrates the incredible economic disparity found around the world  in terms of sustainability however it's not always the rich who are the richest  the book compares thirty families from thirty countries to illustrate the great differences in material goods and circumstances that make up rich and poor societies  of the thirty families reported on twenty-one have a t v but only nine have books  four of the thirty families had computers while five use a mortar and pestle or similar tool to grind grain for food
