guess not particular for   beyond them beyond the word uh dispute we had some concern with respect to uh to  the company's reliability  we looked at the financial statements and we looked at the  assets   they they certainly had a one or two words supply of word non-performing assets and word some real estate that wasn't useful  two words reliability to the company  uh they had a capital structure which was uh not  which was not appropriate for for  the the way the company operated  in fact i was really surprised  the uh banking nature word they arrived at as a result of three or four words   and i wasn't helpful word the financial structure the accounting structure   clears throat   so the point is the letter uh word    this is exhibit uh d forty-one  yes  kay okay   i wanted to put it at ease with respect to  the uh the strawberry fields situation that it could be resolved and it was resolvable   and uh in addition he made another uh three or four words he added another

four words  kay okay   now clears throat there is uh uh   jekyll maintained his interest in the project and there is   exhibit uh d thirty-nine  that's right  and by the they this time  th th this time the time of exhibit d thirty-nine had you met with the national bank of canada again  uh i met with them two words   about this time  uh we we had uh by the time this letter was written we had learned a good deal more about the company  we had gleaned some comfort  the problem i was still having was that  was that mister jolly mister smiley   three or four words they they   wanted it to to go quickly  uh i was concerned with our ability to perform in a timely manner the way they wanted us to uh  and in fact i was i was  determined to that word all  word in order to alleviate that in order to help us with that situation ah we introduced investments-r-us   two or three words invest or could invest in the company for professional first year   and we were also told that a word application   could could help us financially in   in recapitalising this uh company  had it not been for those two things rest of utterance  kay okay sigh   did you have any dealings with uh investments-r-us or  did you work at all in regards to the investments-r-us situation  prior to or at the time of that uh document which is exhibit uh d thirty  - nine  this question over my visit uh to   uh to word at that time needs to be  uh i met with the principals with two of the principals from  investments-r-us uh mister noddy and mister shrek   who uh who introduced me to word  and all sorts of three or four words  investment  and we talked about their conditional investment in the company  uh the company two or three words   one thing uh  did they have any concerns  their biggest concern was that uh certainly from the standpoint of the of the type of investment they saw the potential   they all saw the potential for the tremendous opportunity in this company  uh given the right capital structure and given the right  being situated in the right market the company could do very  well  uh the type of investment they had was not very  successful so their major concern was to three or four words   that is the type of investment  investments-r-us had  actually three or four words the investment investments-r-us had was a third shares  of of uh nuclear industries three or four words which were which were not at all  three or four words and not three or four words   okay  and did you were you able to uh  deal with those concerns  uh i'm sorry deal with those concerns of investments-r-us  yes we were  and did you deal with them and alleviate them before  the offer of august eighteenth   it was right about the same time  we we canned the structure of  two or three words to work for uh for  investments-r-us two or three words  public company as well  okay  and who were you dealing with in that regard  i was dealing with well in the beginning i was dealing with five or six words   with with uh peewee two or three words   ultimately we uh we dealt with uh   magic beans and and and at one stage we  simply turned them over to uh mister humpty to deal with uh  mister humpty   mister humpty actually  mister humpty to uh be the director  word uh another director two or three words   two or three words he secured his  lawyer   and uh he he performed uh   you know paperwork with with uh  four or five words   did you also deal with the neverland stock exchange  absolutely  one of the first things we did was we applied   we wa we wanted to find out what the stock exchange's attitude would be towards us word  involvement word investments-r-us  opportunity was gonna going to complicate the transaction and whether or not we could apply   and did you get that proof  yes we did  clears throat word  showing you document dated october fourth nineteen eighty-nine from the neverland stock exchange directed to yourself and  word processing   word   yes  and and do you  two or three words   yes  did you receive that document  i did  and did that deal with the issues that you've just described  yes it does  and did that contain conditional rules for the issuance of the the warrant and the arrangement that you have described to the court  yes it does  sentence   sentence   clears throat pause about 20 sec   document d thirty-nine the letter of august  eighth nineteen uh eighty-nine did that did that letter get accepted by the parties  this letter was accepted  it was accepted by an eighth party  uh   okay  it was it was word  clear how many shareholders there was  two or three words industries but uh   once we had reviewed the documents we were comfortable with the fact that there was only really one common shareholder and that was mister humpty   not not withstanding the eighth which suggests that there are two but there was only one common shareholder in reality and that was mister humpty   yes   that's right  okay  and cough and uh   was the was the money advanced in the fashion described uh in this document  no it was not  it's uh   can you describe how it was advanced and when  two or three words let's see  uh   this document wasn't offered uh directly  two or three words processing to  john humpty   cough   two or three words processing was not producing the word required by two or three words three hundred thousand dollars uh  and word had received shareholder approval  what we needed to word was some form of interim financing  this is the bridge financing that we heard   we have heard of in these proceedings  it certainly included the bridge financing  okay   carry on  and uh so what we did on an interim basis was  effectively lend john humpty three hundred thousand dollars because and issued in cash  he wanted cash  and uh uh name did not two words in a position to three or four words  and advance the cash on that basis   and cashmore adva   cashmore capital corporation advanced that money  that's right  and clears throat and and  we understand that cashmore capital corporation acquired that money from   two hundred and fifty thousand of that was acquired from  bling corporation end of utterance   kay okay   and uh did that deal to that is evidenced by august  eighth uh get uh papered if you will in terms of a   a share purchase agreement   not this exactly  well certainly word deal with uh  i would say four or five words   this deal i spoke of that we uh   sentence   uh let me show you lawyer shows and discusses something with an extra-corpus speaker for about 45 seconds   word show you the document that's d twenty-six   three or four words that is a share purchase agreement speaker a is too far away from microphone to record rest of this questioning for 15 seconds   is that your document that was produced to  four or five words   yes it is  and was that back in word   yes it was  clears throat   now now we're in september   of of nineteen eighty-nine and can you carry on with uh the transaction at this point in time  what what do you doing  we've got you working with neverland stock exchange in relation to the investments-r-us transaction  did you you deal actually with  investments-r-us yourself  yes sir i did  and who did you deal with there  uh primarily with mister name   okay clears throat   and uhm  yeah we filed word this uh document three or four words in the middle of september we moved forward to to to peak the immediate transaction two or three words the process  i must say that at the time we uh we  didn't expect it to take much time  we expected to four or five words we could process it within not much time at all  four or five words working on it  four or five words it needed a lot of work on the  uh   and what work was that two words  well he's he had to first of all he had he had uh stock exchange approval  over transactions  uh the conditional approval i should say over transactions four or five words the uh   our shareholder approval so that so that  all of the documents that we produce with respect to the acquisition had to be vetted first by the neverland stock  exchange  we should send them uh uh material with respect  to the uh to the officers and directors of the   c company   okay   and get and we had to perform an independent business valuation of the of the   uh company four or five words company  and uh uhm we had to respond to their deficiencies if you will in looking back three or four words    and by deficiencies you're just   that's a term of art uh with the public company dealing with this stock exchange or security commission is that right  yeah that's right basically   in making that they do ask for a bunch of things which we provide them with and word we're asking for a bunch more things  yup   several words word  several words   okay   i i i put in front of you a document that's exhibit d twenty-seven in these proceedings  do you see that  yes i do  a and can you advise us again in terms of the timeline that we're attempting to follow  clears throat what that represents and when it went out and   yes i can very faint   what what this is this is a  uh this is a proxy information circular   and uh this document can be sent  to all the shareholders the shareholders   all the shareholders of of  the public company  and it has to disclose the information on the on the transaction  it was finally approved in the form that was sent out by october the tenth nineteen eighty-nine   and prescribed a new they prescribed a new three or four words   word opportunity after that day was to  three or four words   so it was over on october the eleventh or the  tenth   on october the tenth three or four words  now by this point in time october the tenth  nineteen eighty-nine uh were you aware of the potential of  one or two words polluted one or two words  in terms of the actual word action involved  one or two words   yes i was  and how were you aware of that   well as i stated earlier in  in the beginning we had some concerns about this whole  transaction taking place  word word  an application two or three words  all the documents to be reviewed  uh that application then was turned down   uh mister blobby three or four words  after that  we should word take another run at  that and and two or three words  to overcome uh the conditions that needed to be satisfied  to present three or four words to find the things uh that we rest of utterance
