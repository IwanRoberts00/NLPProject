help towns that suffered the loss of their main industries are doing little to help people in these communities cope with the crisis  that's what delegates attending a national conference in saint john's heard today  lilly powell says counsellors working with struggling communities have to learn to be patient and they have to allow people themselves come up with ideas for their future on their own terms  lauren callaghan reports  lilly powell has spent the last ten years looking at communities in crisis in newfoundland  but she says what she's learned applies to any town in canada that has lost its major industry  she says many government programs set up to help dying communities don't work   that's because they often don't identify the strength of these communities  instead they push people into doing things that they're either not ready for or don't meet their needs  in many cases she says dying towns are urged to draw in new business become competitive  but what many really need is a cooperative approach that involves other communities in the region  she says communities need time to sort things out on their own terms not on a government-driven schedule  and it's difficult because funding and certainly in terms of efficiency we do have you know shrinking budgets so it's very very difficult  marvin chalk knows exactly what powell means  he's the mayor of fortune a community of twenty-two hundred on the burin peninsula in newfoundland  five months ago the fish plant the town's largest employer  shut down throwing hundreds of people out of work  and while the workers are receiving government compensation  chalk says it's not enough  it certainly isn't the answer and that adage that give them the money and they'll be happy that's not true  but chalk admits right now people in his community aren't ready to accept a future without the fish plant  they need time to absorb what has happened and to realize that things will have to change  powell says what counsellors in communities like fortune have to do is offer support and guidance not directive   she says towns have to sort out their own priorities on their own terms and community development workers should merely try to help them along that road   lauren callaghan c b c news saint john's  as many as nine-hundred-thousand canadians who own japanese-built cars will receive voluntary recall
