 uhm   yeah we'll get dad to get her the perfume   we'll get her the stretch pants turtleneck and sweatshirt  like it's a dark  oops i can't spell sweat shirt  sweatshirt   it's a dark grey sweatshirt  mm hm   and i only s i've oh  the mom one it's like a kind of a turquoise background with little flowers on it  yeah   like the mom s no like the mom is kind of a dark turquoisey colour with little flowers on it on the like on top of the turquoise  and it says mom   yeah  well it says concordia university mom   uhm   i dunno don't know you decide  well is there any way you could come down here to see them  like they're hanging in the window so you don't have to come down when the bookstore is open  tsk it's only at the bookstore  yeah down downtown   downtown bookstore  like if you're ever downtown like this weekend or sometime go by the school and they're hanging in the window  tsk okay  like the corner of uh de maisonneuve and guy  you know de maisonneuve and   and they're fifty bucks each  yeah  yikes  that's the problem like do we just get for mom for both  like the other thing is dad's birthday  yeah  and but the other  th like do we wanna want to  get them for both cos that could be   daddy dad's getting dad wants  jeans  yeah  for he pe words   his birthday is such a problem being so close   okay we've done mom maybe the sweatshirt we'll worry about that   word daddy royal copenhagen he needs two bottles  yeah  so we can get him that  yeah  so it's no problem   yeah   cos it's not very expensive it's like twenty-five bucks  for two or each   for one   okay  so  that's what dad'll get for   what  his birthday  uhm  cos uh like if we're getting mom  i think we should get one him for his birthday and one for christmas  okay   and then jeans for christams  well i guess so   like what you know what you should probably do is make up like a one of those gift  f certificates from the gap made up  yeah  and s and just so he can go and try on all the different kinds that he wants  yep  and that way do you get the thirty percent off  yep  awesome  mm hmm  jeans for christmas and what about these sweatshirts  i'll get him uh i guess a fifty dollar certificate  cos some jeans are like forty-eight and that would have to pay a bit of money for tights does that matter  okay   no no no  cos i'll only pay thirty bucks up for it  there's that is a good idea  or fifteen i'll pay the other ha i'll pay the other   well then do you wanna want to  give me the money  i don't have it right now  i'll have to wait till i get paid again  okay  well i'm not doing all my christmas shopping till my next paycheck  okay laugh   my next paycheck is really big so sigh  ..  unclear mumble   so i'll sleep in class word   what are we gonna going to do about the sweatshirts  forget about them  w well i dunno   don't know   i mean  they're fifty bucks each  so much  i know   but then what else could we get mom  oh she's getting quite a bit now  that's true that's true   that's enough  so scratch the sweatshirts maybe for another time  yeah  okay what else okay for dad  for   what about their their   anniversary like   oh that's in april laugh   oh like a the matching ones you mean  yeah  for there's an idea   okay  that's good  yeah   and i was thinking actually a friend of mine is doing this  like just taking a picture of her and her sisters  what   yeah  and giving that to their p her  brother for her birthday or for christmas or something like that cos her parents are divorced but uhm like we could take a picture of just the two of us and g give that to mom and dad as well for their anniversary  cos we don't have time to do it before christmas  that's good   that's a good one too  like formally dressed and sitting i don't know somewhere  mm hmm  i don't know where we'd sit laugh   well we'd go to a uh place wouldn't we  no like take the picture with my camera  okay  i don't know where we could sit though  i'm thinking of somewhere probably at
