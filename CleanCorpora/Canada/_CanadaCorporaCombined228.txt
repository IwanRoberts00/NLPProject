 all of these rods and things four words  teaching multiplication laugh   and a word processing cabinet but laugh  but it's really good  it's really fun and it's really uh   i find it's very interesting way to teach the kids math right  i just four or five mumbled words   uhm and these kids really get to to use the stuff and think of ways of using math  so it's a it's a bit more interesting process but i mean i never taught math in my life  it never even occurred to me that i'd ever have to so   but uhm granted i teach the lower levels so i figured there was very little that i couldn't figure out the day before laugh but  you know when you have the plans if if  all of a sudden you didn't understand it the way it was written in the book and there aren't any more examples or activities in the book well you have to come up with more so  you get pretty busy   uhm i've gone off on all sorts of things so i  well i've already told you about word  classrooms word small groups  yeah so like you could you could  conceivably end up with a class at three levels but you have no more than twelve kids   so that's a big thing and  audience member comments   that's a word question  audience member asks a question   mmm not really  well uhm my first experience was in like i say in a small community and their exposure to english was so limited  they had at that time they only had one t v station so the only english they were hearing were from the five southern teachers who were there and actually that's not true because two of the primary two one of one of them was french so four southern teachers and the nurse  no he was french  so so you know the only english they ever heard was in school so i mean that's not a heck of a lot of exposure  so they they they kinda  kind of scared me my first day i go in there you know  the first day is always the worst day in the world no matter how many times you do it too laugh   the first day of the year is always bad  you don't know the kids and uhm go and ask them questions so what did you do this summer you know or anything  and this sea of little faces just stares back at you  whispering two or three words   nobody even tries  oh my god i'm gonna going to die  groan   they don't talk a lot either so it's like kind of a cultural thing  first start at the  they're not gonna going to be leaping going oh oh oh yes laugh   you know  the day you see that call me  laugh starts you know it's like that's a miracle laugh ends   that never happens  and so when they all sort of have varying language skills it's almost hard to find out whether they do or not because it's really hard to pull it out  but uh that group they they didn't talk a whole lot and so i found out that i had great expectations and all sorts of ideas of stuff that i'd been doing that really rapidly got cut down to size  and that's one of the things that you find no matter where you go  like uh i taught grade six the following year with  with word in inukjuak and i had fourteen students one level  and their language abilities i mean i was just  just floored they were just so completely different than the other kids  they they did english in grade three but they'd had consistent one level classes and and  consistent teachers probly probably like a couple of two of their teachers uhm had been in this village for like at that time three or four years so they already had a very good command of what they were doing and you could tell like we used to always say well like we know the kids that had gone from  from mabel to sandy or sandy to  mabel they switched levels at one point but  you could tell that these kids had gone through these teachers cos they were very very good teachers and they had a really really solid base  and there's no doubt in our mind it was these two teachers that had made a difference for these kids  uhm and so they they could talk up a storm if they had the desire to get do that  sometimes you word but  they definitely had uhh a higher level of of   english  but even so it's it's lower than   sta   we still there's still a long way to go  and i think we haven't challenged them necessarily enough along the way  i think a lot of the time we've sort of gone oh well we don't   wanna want to you know upset them and we don't want them to think they can't do it kinda kind of thing so uhm go a little under two words   that's my theory i d   i'm sure my colleagues would disagree with me on that one and certain word laugh   i feel they should be reading  certainly when i had my group my w   the other thing that happens is the longer you're there is the easier it gets and this is probably true wherever you would go but once you've taught the same level more than once then   but the third year is the greatest year laugh   it's like you've got it nailed by that time and you can do all these things that you've dreamt of doing before but you you  didn't have the energy to pull off  cos it takes a lot of energy   it takes a lot of energy to be on every day all day  and and you have to really really really be on the ball  and nobody ever seems to ever get sick because there's never any substitutes  so you go in if you're dying because you don't really you know you don't know what they're gonna going to do if they  they cancel school if they can't find a substitute for the kids  so you know that the kids are just gonna going to  have a day off which laugh may or may not be a good thing  laugh depending on how how things have been going they may want a break they may want to take a little pause  but i uhm it's i it's   very tiring  and by your third year two words you know what you can do and you know how   even though it's a different group  every year it's a different group right  no that's not true  actually in split levels you can often have the same kids  for up to two maybe three three or four years which that's  actually i'm sure that's worse i haven't had that experience myself but i'm sure that's worse for them uhh  muttering starts instead of changing having like the  five or six words end muttering   laugh   do all sorts of  and you have also all the two years of uh math sheets that you've laugh starts accumulated so that you don't have to do any more laugh ends   two or three words starts to wear off a bit though and you have to start recreating but uhm definitely  uhm i'm so far off of all sorts of things i'm not exactly sure uhm  would you like to see the video  audience responds   it's a vi uh  some of you were in the hallway talking with me so you know what i'm talking about  i brought a video that was made some of it was made my first year in the north  i didn't realize that till i saw it the other day uhm  it's just a visual thing that like there's no talking  word just a sound and and uh visual  loud white noise begins aaah i was trying to get this so it's at the right channel but uh  audience member asks a question   uhm just two or three words uhm i don't know we'll see how it what it looks like  i'm assuming it's not the right station yet  uhh it starts off this is  if you if you go to ungava side this is how you can get there once you get to kuujjuaq  uhm and it just takes you basically it takes you  to tasiujaq the little village and a couple of communities that i haven't quite figured out exactly where uhm  but it's kind of almost a year in the life of tasiujaq  there's there's there's a festival not a festival a wedding or something i can't member remember   what  and you go out fishing   so i may say things as we go along because i get all excited cos these are my old students laugh and stuff that are there  but it it's there's no classroom stuff it's all about 5 minutes of loud video, some untranscribed text   okay  they won a a a a fishing boat in halifax actually it was the word   and they hadta had to   the only way you can get there acourse of course  is to go all the way around all the way around labrador and   the day the boat arrived was like our third fourth week in school and the kids were all excited in the morning and i thought the  something was up  we didn't know what i mean   came back to school after lunch like we hadn't been in school fifteen minutes when every kid takes off out the door laughs with audience and all the teachers are standing there going what where'd they all go  we had no idea  and what had happened was the boat come in  and they'd known cos they could see it from afar in the morning but nobody really infor like especially the few of us that were new that year we had no idea th w   what was this boat what was this whole big thing  and i mean these the the the men in the village were on this boat they'd been gone for six weeks these kids hadn't seen their dads and all the women i mean the whole village  a j he gave me plenty of grief  really nice kid but boy was he a pain laugh   these are this is one of my other students too fishing  but that was like the big pen and that was it for school for the rest of the day  music from video in background starts those sorts of things happen  you get to do sort of nature trips every so often  kay okay can't do anything else today  about thirty seconds of music from the video, some quiet untranscribed comments   audience member asks a question   uhm the year we were in tasiujaq the the the  principal was on sabbatical doing some studies and he felt that  this was one of his projects that year when he was off you know  five or six words   audience member comments   it's a very exciting experience first year teacher laugh  turns into a principal   the north is a mysterious place   now these are people from another village two words  picking berries   that's whatcha what you do in the fall  blueberries and uh word er uh they're   kinda kind of like cranberries red  they're red berries and they're really tart  word these black berries that look like blueberries but they're black  i never found out what the english version of them are  question and answer session with audience untranscribed   yeah  it's always windy  that's one thing it's always windy  graduation  uh she's one of our principals  she's a university grad uhm   and this i'd have to see it again i can't remember what this was but i remember being there   anytime to dance is a great time  we had lots of fun two or three words   laugh word   he's much taller than me now   big guy he's like seven five now   laugh i'm not sure why that one's bundled up like that i think it's in a  well they have these wild party games to play and one of them is  you throw a whole bunch of clothes in the middle of the room and try to get dressed up in as much of it as possible that's one of the laughs with audience   at halloween the trick of halloween i well at least in tasiujaq i'm not sure if this happens in every village but is to get   com so people can't recognize you  so you put on as much stuff as you possibly can  and this is again another dangerous thing that wants to catch these people to musical chairs but everything looks like it's a game you've played before but there's a twist to it that  audience member comments   it's a lot of fun   flags don't last long in the north it's really sad  they get blown to smithereens in no time   just shreds   oh there's a classroom   they're not all like this some have have   word desks  that was marcus laugh   that was marcus 's secondary class i recognize the sweater laugh   that's my husband   this is grade one   grade one   kindergarten   this is the lady who made my parka end music from video
