 to him and i said so i realized that i was in that period of my life and whenever i need people i just have to  tell them that's what period i was in and just   mhh hmm  well it was really great to get that over with because  it's just closed something for me  and so another situation that i always think well one day i'm just  gonna going to do this i'm just  gonna going to just fess up and i'm just gonna going to do this is  one day i'm gonna going to have to say to  matt unless i've done it already but i don't think i did  but   i can remember one day i can remember exactly you know what my hair was like and what i was wearing and what  it it was actually this kind of weather outside and uh we were living on empress street  and i came home from a skating competition and i had just done very well  it was like jeunesse en forme or something like that   anyways it was skating and i was i think  my ego was big big big   and we were still like   he was still living at home so he must have been like   word   early sixteen or something  ya  cos he left something he was seventeen years old  ya  it broke your mother's heart  i know  laugh   and i we all know that  anyway so um it was saturday and uhm he was sitting in the corner reading the funnies and i whipped the funnies right out of his hand and sat dow down   no  he was sitting somewhere and i whipped the funnies right out of his hand and went and sat on the corner of the couch that wasn't upholstered yet and uhm   ya i whi i whipped the funnies right out of his hand i went and sat at the couch   and sat on the couch and i started reading them   and and of course he said give those back to me and we started having like a nattering argument and my mother said   and then my mother called him from the kitchen i think  like we had just come back from skating so naturally she was like back in her position cooking or doing something cos nobody had done anything while she was gone   and she tried to you know mother us from the kitchen and it didn't stop and we were having a real fight  we were i can remember because i  er enjoyed it because matt was so  nice usually to me  probably the first time you've seen them fighting in a long time word and you were happy   laugh   ya because   ya cos cos  usually he beat up on me when i was little but i mean this  time had past and now i was a bit more mature and he didn't do that any more and he was a hippie and i was a skater and we were very very different and   but we were having an argument and i was really enjoying it  and so i had the funnies and i was s   i was saying of course i have the funnies and he was going no i have the funnies and i was lying   and mommy came in and i told her that i had them  and i competed against him in a way to tell her that i'd had them  and she said let your sister have the funnies   and he did   isn't that awful   laugh   and i should apologize to him to get   if i could get that off my chest that would be like  probably the last thing that i feel guilty about  oh that's a standard sibling uh situation  isn't it? ya ya   but i can remember it so it must really bother me   you know one thing he always talks about  another one of those those family things is you guys playing monopoly   and he says sitting around and he says t j always used to talk about me being such a nice guy and everything and we'd sit down   and ya and  we you'd sit next to the family the family and start playing monopoly and he says t j  would get so mad at me  oh it's true   i know this story   because she says he's really not a nice guy  see look he's trying to get all the property and he won't let me have er anything and he's really not a nice guy  he's   he was competitive  ya ya  he says when it when it's money  his true self comes out  and he's he's really not a nice guy after all laugh   and that's the story he often tells that story  about bev is she thinks that i have really a mean streak underneath it because of the way i play monopoly   laugh   laugh because i think he cheated too  oh he does  he does  he cheats he cheats when he plays games  it's like when he plays scrabble  i remember playing scrabble a long time ago   but the gr and you know how   he he he uh when he uh describes things or he tells stories that aren't true or whatever to people uh w   w   if you know him you know that they're lies and it's a big gaff  it's funny right  it's word of the word    why would he do that though  cos it's funny he would could     like that's not what people do   no no cos it's funny  like everybody knows that it that that   that's happening  it's like when he does it to your father all the time   you know he tells these stories to your father or he  pre he pretends things to your father  uh and your father kinda kind of  falls for them and it's a big joke and everybody around the family  around the dinner table knows it and it's a big joke right?  oh   so i uh so he  he did that all the time  what was it  it was something that uhm uhm nope i forget gone  it was about the monopoly   nope i forget   oh i wanted to know   remember yesterday again we were talking about uhh in the washroom yesterday and uh and you were talking about that abusive relationship you were in   that guy that remember the   i think i met him just once or twice  where did you meet him  how did you get involved with him  oh i'm embarrassed to say it   well i i'm not embarrassed to say i'm embarrassed because he was younger than me and i i   mean did i fall for him because he was good looking  i mean i knew he was younger than me and he was good looking and he was so nice but he comes from a family where a whole bunch of members of his family are schizophrenic   and i and i think that he could  he could just like switch mood   well well i know obviously he could switch moods   so how i met him was i moved out from living with tom stewart   mhh hmm   and uhm and i left   i had like a show at wollock's in like a week   and i'd had the show   i had a show in peterborough in like a week and my work was finished and was just about to be transported and i had to do this show on the canal through saw gallery   and i just cou i just it was   time to leave  it was like i couldn't stop talking about it  i couldn't stop talking about it  so i i came home from cross country skiing one day and i said tonight after supper i'm leaving and i did and i went and i slept at a friend's house  and then i spent the and i had two hundred and like forty bucks in the bank   and i took my skates and a change of socks and a change of underwear and i walked up and down bank street looking for an apartment  it was awful  i felt lost  it was just terrible   and then this guy told me the same guy whose house i had slept at that night who's just like just totally like slept on his sofa  he to he told me that uhm  a guy he knew at uhm was  sharing a a place on len  on uh leonard street  kind of in ottawa south  and so i went to see it the next day   and the price was right and and uhm i would have my own room and we would share a kitchen  and it was like a s uh   and so that's how   so so paul was their cousin  and he came around   and uh i just met him because he came around but then it turns out that i met his sister and i met his mother and they were both artists and they were really really lovely people and  oh i see you were with people oh okay    ya  and i actually think that looking at these paintings that are in this room this woman brenda lewis i wonder if she would've been at the university of ottawa at the same time as his sister erin  was   but anyways his sister was just this totally flaille  uhm big eyes kind of zen been to india  lost an ovary at the age of sixteen metaphysical like   tr&egrave;s flaille   and i really en i really loved  his sister  like she was really neat  ya ya   and i thought wow he's related to her  he's gotta got to be okay  and he was younger than me and it's it was   like no no no you can't have a relationship with this younger guy  and it was just it was just a mess  and when i k   ya so when when i could see that  anyways i think i was smoking a lot of dope at the time  and i just and and i realized that like very early on it was abusive for a lot of things that he would say to me  but i i had really lost so much self-esteem because like already like my second marriage had failed  and  mhm   so when when you moved out of that house you moved out together with him  you moved out because you were gonna going to  start living together or   no no i didn't even know him  not at all   i moved away from tom stewart just because   it was awful and then we moved to wakefield   no no no but after two or three words  moved into this house   two words   oh uh he kept telling me he was gonna going to be a ski patroller out west and so   he kept looking for his own thing that i was gonna   going to do and i kept saying okay i can just hang in with him  until until he goes to do that and then i'll go do my own thing and then he just never went he just never went   and he also was doing like construction jobs and using my car and i rea i look back and i realize i was being totally used  no but how did you get out of that house to the house in wakefield together  oh oh okay um   this woman i knew who knew that i had s   split up with tom offered me her house for the summer cos her husband was an m p member of parliament and she was going back out west where he was an m p   and she offered me her house for the summer   oh okay   and he moved in with me except for i could have the house for free but he had to do something   ah okay  and he had to do s it turned out it it blew our friendship  he never did what he said he was gonna going to  do  it was awful   it was really   i gave her a drawing
