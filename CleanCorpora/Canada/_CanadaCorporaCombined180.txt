 morrison takes a look  they feed out front but the bears get to it  and here's esposito on the left wing for thompson  in across the line  thompson trying to cut in on goal  thompson centring out front  it bounces to dawkins   and he'll hold on with five fifty-one to go in the first and the dinosaurs in front of golden bears one nothing  thompson driving wide and tried to centre  we'll hear from mike thompson during our first intermission  and he keeps his wheels once again but he's going against a ah all-canadian defenseman last year jamie pegg  and uh pegg just ke kept  him to the outside  turned with him  thompson uh was able to keep the puck but he wouldn't   couldn't get to the net couldn't drive right in front of dawkins there  the cow bell an added feature to our broadcast tonight  laugh   one of the fans here with a a  noise-making apparatus  they also have a little noise across the ice   that's the band from the university of calgary   puck goes in behind the net  aaron zarowny checked by ruark  ruark comes up with it and he'll move it ahead for the dinosaurs  off the glass and into the crowd  the glass here's very short along the side and uh doesn't take much for the puck to clear it   and a pretty good crowd tonight in calgary  uh a few more people than yesterday  the one side's packed and i think there's uh a pretty good section of golden bears supporters to our left uh uh just left of the bear's bench tonight   five thirty-eight left in the first   one nothing dinosaurs in front of the golden bears as aaron zarowny prepares to face off against todd johnson   dinosaurs have it off the draw  krywulak clearing out to centre  it's knocked down by hjertaas  ahead to aaron zarowny and he taps it back to trevor sherben   now on the left side it's tapped in across the goal   l line uh across the blue line   simpson has it for alberta  turning trying to get away from couldwell but calgary will march it out to centre ice  johnson getting rid of it  now it's cleared back ahead for colin zarowny  trying to work away from masters   he's taken out by johnson  and johnson sends it all the way down the ice  this should go as icing as hjertaas goes back after it   and icing indeed the call against the dinosaurs who were about to make a line change and so krywulak rather than knock that thing down let it go and now we'll have a faceoff deep in calgary territory  once again the effort there for the bears but the lot  uh they're not really g uh  getting a lot done  no really ah good chances on dawkins the whole game tonight i don't think   no none   there's a couple fluttering shots towards him but he'll stop those  a couple long ones but uh  if they think they're gonna going to get  laugh a long one like frank got last night uh they're dreaming  i don't think dawkins will let another ugly one in like that for awhile  jickling prepared to faceoff against flint to the glove-hand side of dawkins   five oh four left in the first   and the linesman won't toss it in there   waving jickling outta out of there  twice tonight jickling's got tossed out of the face off  uh uhm we got esposito up there as well on this one though  we saw a lot of that last night   esposito to faceoff against flint  esposito kicks it back to haney  haney snapping it toward the goal but that was blocked by townsend  and the dinosaurs have it  here's marlborough whistling it out to centre ice  hard pass for townsend  off his stick into the bear bench  coach daum uh really shuffling the lines up here  it's a combination we haven't seen before jickling esposito and haney  and uh two good faceoff men in in  the deep zone but uh coach daum's kept em them  up for the entire shift  and uh inters interesting  to see  you gotta have got to do something to switch it up and try and uh create some offense   jickling will faceoff against townsend at centre   one nothing dinosaurs in front here in calgary  esposito picks up the puck off the draw and dumps it deep into his own zone   back to pick it up is pullishy  up the wall the bears clear the zone  marble trying to send it back in  gave it away  and here goes haney down the wing  haney ahead for esposito   esposito moves in and jickling is called offside on the right wing  tried to drag the back skate   and looked like a very close play there but the draw's  comin' coming with four thirty-seven left in period number one   and we should mention evan this last week uh the award winners for canada west were handed out and uh brian purdy of the saskatchewan husky not 'huskies' who i never got the opportunity to see play  you might have seen him in the western league  but he was named the canada west m v p and the sullivan award winner senator a. joseph sullivan trophy: outstanding player for this season  he played in nipawin of the s j h l saskatchewan junior hockey league and also uh brandon of the western league so i did get a chance to see purdy play  oh okay   he's supposed to be quite the player  fantastic fantastic hockey player  and uh he was uh about it for saskatchewan   laugh really   ya laugh   i bet   here's haney across the line  his shot a pad save  jickling get to the rebound  takes it behind the net  marble's on him  eremenko back to help out   they freeze it back there but eremenko will dig it out of the traffic and he'll flip it out to centre ice  pullishy with it at his own blue line  plays it over to goodkey   goodkey marches that puck to centre  goodkey'll flip it in wide of the dinosaur net   thompson out there forechecking against zulyniak  throws zulyniak off the puck  degner in to follow out   he's trying to get around zulyniak but zulyniak able to clear up the wing to murray  murray takes a look  boy is that cow bell ever making me mad   they dump it in across the line and degner  pardon me  that's tiltgen  it's got me confused too  tiltgen at centre   up on the left side  penalty coming up as pegg touches it   and the referee is sending stephenson to the penalty box for slashing  his second straight penalty and so we will see the bears on the power play for the second time tonight  and mike thompson doing the job irritating these dinos  he he drew two penalties last night  and drew another penalty tonight  and now the whole dino squad's chasin'   chasing him all over the ice and all he's doing is  chirpin' chasing at em them   and he's doing the job   and the bears gotta have got to  have a better power play this time  the last the first power play tonight was ah ahh very bad very ugly   hittin' hitting  ugly that one but they'll try to draw even as they go to work on their second power play here  stephenson for slashing at sixteen twenty-six   we gotta have got to do something about that guy with the bell  laugh go pay somebody to take him out  well maybe we'll work on that during the intermission   puck fired down the ice by the dinosaurs and back to pick it up is trevor sherben   sherben takes a look  he's a bears supporter though i think  that's the that's the good part the bell guy  tiltgen in there forechecking for it  schonek comes up with it  gets it around the boards  sherben has it on the right point  he'll move in  lets the blast go  that's blocked by couldwell   that shook him up a bit  bears clear to the corner  thompson has it   couldwell still down  now he gets up  degner behind the net  to tiltgen  back to degner  trying to work it back to tiltgen   tiltgen has it in the right corner  feeds it behind the net for thompson  out front  here's   trevor sherben moves in  lets the shot go  and he cranks it wide   bears have it  tiltgen in the corner now   they pass to the point  over the stick of jickling  they had the dinosaurs running big time   and bears move it in across the line  another penalty coming up against calgary   and i'm not sure what this one's gonna going to  be but the bears are gonna going to get a two-man advantage now   but hold on here   i think degner mighta might have got a slashing penalty and that's gonna going to hurt the bears  johnson is going over to talk to referee dave shaw  calgary was getting the original penalty and then i think degner drew an even-up call and so the bears stay on the power play   they have both gates open over at the penalty bench  pegg is going off for calgary  and pegg uh stick his knee out when jickling was making a move at the blue line on him and uh jickling drew a penalty but terry degner he didn't really do anything too drastic uh but lovsin came over and whacked him and degner whacked him back with a slash and uh the referee decided to even that up  and uh uhh bit of a bad play by degner there cos he should just go  two-man advantage there for a minute the bears would have had so that one hurts a little bit  these penalties at seventeen twenty-four   one nothing dinosaurs in front   degner two minutes for cross-checking   pegg two minutes for slashing  i think degner was mad because as he came across the blue line he got dumped right at the blue line   the bears might have had a two-on-one   he got dumped and uh went after the dinosaur player  i don't know if he knew there was a penalty coming up  a minute and two seconds uhh still left in the bears power play though   bears with it off the faceoff  ruark gets to it for calgary and he'll send it down the ice   back to get after it is krywko  five on four five skaters on four skaters power play as the bears work it at center  aaron zarowny flips it in wide of the net  bounces off the boards  ruark back to pick it up   over to marble  marble back to ruark  he'll clear it   and he sends it ahead  here's a breakaway pass for lovsin  outta out of his reach  and lovsin will try to set up morrison  gets it over to morrison however the pass slightly behind him  bears have it  here's jickling in across the line  trying to cut around ruark   lovsin took it out  haney to the line now  drop pass  bears a little fortunate there  here's a shot by esposito  puck rolls toward the net  haney kicks it into the corner   ruark bumping with aaron zarowny  haney has it  takes a hit from marble   bears after that thing  they get it up the wall  jickling lost it  lovsin able to chip it out to centre ice   that's it for the power play  bears  esposito will move it  in across the line here's colin zarowny moving in  he shoots  save by dawkins  real nice heads-up play by frank esposito to see zarowny coming off the bench and hitting him in uh full speed  uh colin had a good chance but uh didn't get much on the shot  similar to the pass that esposito tipped over to strand on the game winner in overtime last sunday night  very similar  frank's not the best skater in the world and even on this big ice surface though he still looks good cos he's using his head and he's making the the the smart plays  golden bears trail by a goal here with a minute twenty-seven left in the first period  todd johnson on the power play at the four thirteen mark  of this opening frame
