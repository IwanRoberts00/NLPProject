 for piano lessons  but you don't wanna want to look at if you wanna want to way to  turn kids off completely to music so that they y'know you know they're they're badgered into taking  unless they have the natural talents and they're there at three years old and playing like crazy already you know  mhm   but they don't uh they really don't  stay in music for a long period of time if you  if you put them in i found anyway in into   the real structured programs  any of the kids have that have gone on uhm are in with teachers that motivate them  that's mostly at that age   y'know you know a little later ya you have to get into the very structured programs  mhh hmmm   mhh hmm   but uh at that that age they just have to be with someone who'll make them have fun y'know you know   well i'd be interested in that  i'd like to see what he could do with that  uh and did you uhm   but i just i just   anyways back to that room  i just see that room like   i see it there and i'm i really want it  it it it isn't contributing to the energy of the house i   it it to me it's sort of like a dead space  and in the summer it's just like the newspaper room  well give me a break i mean it seems to me that it j  it every other space in the house seems so much more contributing to y'know you know what goes on in the domain  and the house just seems like lost space and  ya   ya  i think it i think it should be  y'know you know   well that'd be a good idea   and when you weren't using it you wouldn't be heating it  because it sucks up so much heat anyways because of the bricks and  ya ya a lot of the cold ya comes in from the bottom too  there's nothing heated underneath   well less now because we have  the door to the shed but   less   so let's mention that some time  to brian   no just throw it out in throw it out into the dinner conversation when he's had a few beers and   laugh   and uhm  ya i was thinking we have to have we have to have uhm  isn't this perfect  a cat art a sculpture on the table and tea  mhm   uhm we have to have dinner sometime  i'm feeling  like today i went grocery shopping and i thought gasp this is a new me like uh  you bought gro you bought groceries laugh   i actually no i ya and i bought like more than  like spread and stuff like that right like  i bought i thought okay i'm gonna going to make this sauce  with this and then when this is left over i'm gonna  going to use it with that and   mhm two words     i bought those slivered almonds   you planned you planned   ya  so that when like   you food planned   well i imagined more like   but laugh i was c more conceptual fea  laugh   ya   any i haven't heard any news from anybody of what's happening at christmas time  have you heard from dianne or no   two or three words   dianne said she might be coming down and she'd just let us know w when  she decides what she's doing  but what if they decide they wanna want to   come down for new year's cos they've heard of these great new year's and now you're the only one going to that party  laugh well that's uhm i uh   then i'll have to host everybody   exactly   oh dear it won't be the same  word   cos uh apparently uhm matt said bill  and val may wanna want to come down at new year's as well   laugh   and that would cause another problem  but matt is  you know matt he's of the oh they're  they're our family they can come  no you can't do that   laugh   so and matt would ask first  but uh that's that's kind of his  his thinking   unless you went there for the afternoon   ya  and then we went out to dinner or had dinner at my house or something like that  ya  which i could do and laugh   mhm   i really could  i really could  i could do it by now  i feel ready again   uhm and then we could just all meet out somewhere later  or are are you supposed to stay where you're going  like if you're going there in the afternoon that's an awful long stay to s to go there in the afternoon and stay there till one  mhm  that's a long time to be with people that you don't really know that well  ya  well that's what i thought anyways when you told me you were doing it   ya  they said it was gonna going to   start around two and we'd have potluck dinner and blah blah blah but   but just generally speaking uh christmas christmas   uh i don't know word what he's  doing  i in between   i haven't t emailed   my sister nobody  well we have to have one family dinner at our house with all  brian's family so you guys can come to that which you probably will really like which matt will probably really like   they're coming down this year  well i invited them to come down because brian's  sisters are great fans of my work and there's that show at city hall and   if they don't if they don't come here then we go there and it's y'know you know     brian says i'm imagining it but it's just so christian  i just want like everybody to come here and just have it be like neutral in the forest y'know you know   and the they they want to come   they say they like to come the day after christmas   like a boxing day thing  mhh hmm  so then we exchange some gifts and it's really great for the kids cos they play   but i wou what i wanted to do  but i but i don't know yet if the gallery is open at city hall   so what i wanted to do   i mean i don't want them to come the day after christmas but  that's when they want to come  but i would rather it was a like another  day later   ya   or but in between christmas and new year's i asked them to come down  so he has two sisters  between them they have one two three five kids   and then he has a brother who has two kids but they're uhm more like kevin's age  one just went to cegep collège d'enseignement général et professionnel this year  mhh hmm  and there's his dau daughter   kristi she   imagine cory in like a beautiful beautiful  fifteen year old girl  so there's this girl like that kristi   i mean she looks  redhead  total total  she looks just like cory because her mother  is a redhead as well   but they're divorced so   you wouldn't believe brian's brother   looks like a burned out bureaucrat no hair   really eh  totally different physique  totally totally different   huh   apparently i don't know how deep the conversation got but apparently uh brian was talking about his dad's death yesterday with  matt   and uhm uh  cos w just out of the clear blue  matt said last night hey did you know that brian's dad was only sixty years old when he died one or two words    well we'd just been talking about that recently  ah okay  ya   personally i think he needs to process a lot of wholes  a whole lot of stuff about his family  not bad stuff but just uh   there's a lot of   sigh he was the oldest son and he worked the hardest and  his brother's brother has got stuff   his brother got stuff and his father died  and he didn't go a lot when his father was ill  and his sisters kept saying you should come to the hospital now but he couldn't stand going cos they he  had this all these tubes stuck in him and everything and  mhh hmm   ya  so then he died and he wasn't there when he died  oh that's it   we were just talking about something the other day and he said uhm   oh we were watching something on t v and i said is that what they did with your father  like they theyx had to pull the plug like they had to all make the decision   and that actually   i mean i guess i knew it was happening at the time but i was just more like concerned with the way brian was reacting and i wasn't   y'know you know it was a   sort of like a second layer right  like we weren't in toronto we were here  mhh hmm  and brian was asked to go and he did go for a couple days and just basically like visited his mom and sat and looked at his dad with all these things going in him and the machine making him breathe and  he brian couldn't s  he just can't can't handle that  ya   uhm so we just we talked about that   so that only like two days ago   we didn't talk about much  it was very casual it's like while we're like doing the dishes or something it's not  mhm   ya i was wondering if it isn't some kind of crisis  coming or something  it's not even like this   if he'd uh y'know you know  just recently been thinking about it  if there was something  cos if he it's not not it's not that   it's not bad news that he talked about it   no but it's not the type of stuff that he normally talks to  matt about  i guess maybe they haven't been alone and having a conversation along those three or four words   i know i'm always on his case to have a friend  ya  y'know you know so maybe he's   how did it come up   i have no idea  i didn't get really get a chance to talk to matt about it  just out of the clear blue he just   brian mentioned his dad and said that he died at sixty isn't that bizarre and he started to tell me a little bit about how he died  cos i didn't realize that he had died when he went in for  uh his oper you know a lung operation   ya   he had the lung transplant  ya   see i didn't realize that  i thought he had died just from severe asthma  no clear throat   and uh so   totally fit eh   his lungs were totally fucked but this  man was like totally fit  ya   ya   like they told him  ya   well this is it and i this is what i   say to brian on a regular basis  are you gonna going to be like your dad like the doctor tells you   five years y'know you know   like he knew for years that his lungs were going right  and the doctors had told himstop farming   mhm   y'know you know stop farming  they had a bed and breakfast  they had  y'know you know   he kept farming y'know you know up until like   oh on christmas we went there when i first started living with him   and he went in he went in and he  hooked up all the c the uhm the horses   these belgian workhorses and uhm he took us for a ride around the farm on the sleigh   i mean it was a great picture  mhm   but i mean he was sick for like days after that because  just hooking up heavy breaths   ya   and i and i see brian  like that now y'know you know   not not breathing but in another sense his body   his body itself ya ya ya  well i mean   ya yea doing it doing it doing it   and so i don't mean to turn the conversation to myself but i mean can you imagine living with a person who's like hard on themselves  and you don't wanna want to be angry at the person  mhm   ya  and you don't wanna want to be trying to control the person
