 thanks very much matt   twenty-six minutes now after eight  here's don white   a four two win for the canadiens last night in the first post patrick roy era game word   can't argue with that   no you can't  everytime there's change the canadiens ice hockey team do well for a short while anyway  they beat the devils last night at the montreal forum  it doesn't get easier  they play the penguins in pittsburgh tonight  mario lemieux is the top scorer in the n h l  national hockey league   and he's got some great linemates as well  and this will be a true test as vincent damphousse has said for the montreal canadiens  but now that we've had a few minutes or a few hours a few days to  sit back and digest what has gone on here let's look at the facts of the montreal canadiens  there are now only four players left from the team that won the stanley cup only two and a half years ago  which tells you that the canadiens were not happy with winning the stanley cup  obviously most teams would be thrilled to win it even with the problems that montreal allegedly had at the time  that patrick roy won the stanley cup for them  well it's true they got by because of patrick roy and the play of  john leclair and ahh the a couple of other defensemen uh j j daigneault one of them who played pretty well eric desjardins who is now in philidelphia  all these key players are gone  the ones who are left are uhh patrice brisebois benoi&icircumflex;t brunet lyle odelein and vincent damphousse  so the canadiens have changed a lot  now there are nine europeans on the team including four russians  don cherry is going to have something to say about that saturday night when the canadiens host the new york rangers   montreal slavs laugh   oh he's not going to be happy about it i can tell you that  already he's not  but that's probably a good thing isn't it i mean isn't it   you see this and this is where some of the criticism about this trade that was made uh for martin rucinsky and jocelyn thibault and andrei kovalenko is that kovalenko and rucinsky not necassarily known for their hard nosed play  they don't bring toughness and character to this team  and that's exactly what the canadiens were missing and they got rid of lot of it when they let captain mike keane and patrick roy go to the colorado avalanche  and we'll hear mario tremblay put it all in perspective here  speech by mario tremblay   well weird thing said at the end there  but but why trade him if he was  had so much heart and was so great for the organization and loved him so much  offensively he wasn't producing  but that's not the point  the whole point dates back to the preseason when mike keane was named captain of the montreal canadiens  mike are you going to learn french   ahh no it's not necessary guys was his answer   uhh we don't speak french in the locker room here     punishment punishment   but what about last little that last little   clip clip there   bad p r   mario tremblay is just already abdicating the stanley cup  give it up  might be closer to a cup there   oh well  other scores  uhh other scores  yes we do have some uh l a kings over winnipeg six three hartford beat the islanders seven four tampa bay over anaheim two one rangers and chicago tied at five  the atlanta games opening ceremonies  they're not releasing the doves next year  it will be a symbolic gesture  whatever that means  they haven't explained what it is  to start off the games at the opening ceremonies   what think it's unfair to doves or something  well they're worried that they say it's cruelty to birds and animals and and groups are getting down on them  i can imagine because of all the planes flying overhead during the ceremonies  welcome to the modern world  twenty-nine minutes now after eight   and that's john hiatt with the song you must go from his latest album walk on  john hiatt's at the spectrum tonight  samuel derry> is here this morning to talk about hiatt  also talking about danielle martineau uhh the montreal princess of zydeco  she's got a new c d and also will be playing at caf&eacute; campus   good morning samuel   laugh   we laugh we just made   laugh   morning hoyle   just being thrown across the studio here  yeah some of our laugh   but   no the action never ends in daybreak that   laugh   not not only does someone come in with seconds to spare and say change your microphone  but samuel flings himself into a chair that unfortunately has wheels on it  that's right i i went flying  and i i have now picked myself up off the floor and am ready to talk about john hiatt  returning to his classical roots  yeah he really is  hiatt's last album was a   oh yeah classic roots sorry   well let me i should say classic roots  not classical laugh mumble     cos actually classical yeah classical   does not uhh does not apply to john hiatt  it really is classic roots rock  um his his last album was a record called perfectly good guitar which was kind of a musical departure for this rootsy singer songwriter  cos it featured a tougher louder uhh really guitar sound that was inspired by a new generation of grungy rockers like nirvana and soul asylum  i kinda kind of liked it but  word it was hardly uh john hiatt's best uh record  um but the latest album from this indiana-born rocker which is called walk on is really much closer to the back to basics down home sound that's been hiatt's trademark for a number of years  um, in fact this new album is really reminiscent of the great mid-eighties albums from hiatt  records like bring the family and slow turning  which i think most people consider to be john hiatt's best albums  um and it really goes back to that classic roots sound  though there is still there's a couple sort of hard rockers there as well  so what do you think  one of his better albums this new one  i think it is actually  i mean it's his best album probably still is bring the family but walk on is a very strong album  um a song like you must go which is what we were just listening to is really the perfect example of what's great about john hiatt  it there's something about the john hiatt sound  it's really sh shrouded in classic americana  a real rootsy sort of some kind of southern rocking feel to it  but it also has a contemporary feel  i mean it's not old fashioned uhh music  and as always with hiatt i mean really the key here is  is the songwriting  the guy is just a great songwriter  in fact that's why he's probably better known for his songs which have been covered by everyone from bob dylan to bonnie raitt to   to even iggy pop  um and hiatt who's who's in his early forties writes about real life adult situations  which i mean may not sound that extraodinary but  but unfortunately enough is is a suprisingly rare thing in rock and roll where you have middle aged rockers like mick jagger who are still going on about chicks and cars as if they are still teenagers  hiatt writes about real people and people we can identify with  and he doesn't pretend that he he's  sixteen  i mean his specialty is writing about relationships  um especially relationships gone wrong  and as the title walk on implies this album really is full of references to wandering and hitting the road  and it really seemed to me in many ways to be a kind of mid-life crisis album  and actually a lot of long time john hiatt fans thought oh my god this is it   he's fallen back off the wagon cos he did have drinking problems and a lot of personal problems  but according to to the article in this morning's gazette local newspaper he says no this is just what he's writing about but he's still happily married which is good to hear  um musically it's just an incredibly rich album  it's produced by don smith who who's  produced records for the tragically hip and keith richards  and he's a real good match for hiatt because he specializes in down home rootsy uhh guitar rock and that's what john hiatt is all about  this is tonight at the spectrum  i assume with the kind of music he does he's probably pretty good in concert  oh he's great  i saw him the last time he played the spectrum and   and his records are great but i mean it's not a clich&eacute; to say that that i mean you gotta  got to see this guy live  this is the perfect place  and he really rocks rocks out in a big way live too  okay up next danielle martineau song   now wait a minute here  i was expecting cajun derivative music and some great accordion playing and there she is singin   well yeah actually and she you know   and to be brutally honest she's not the greatest singer in the world  i actually wanted to play that track cos i think it's a different side to danielle martineau  and to kind of give you the idea specially   especially on this album like she really is known for  for her zydeco cajun sound  and there are some there's a song called   zydeco musico which is sort of classic cajun  but i wanted to show that this album it really has a kind of variety of of musical sounds that i think might surprise some people who who think it's just only straight new orleans style stomp  but she is in town to play  presumably to get herself through an entire show she's  gotta got to reach into the cajun repertoire  oh no  absolutely  and again you know talking about the difference between uh uh you know the records and live  live of course that sort of cajun fiddle stomping  she's got this great fiddle player michael ball in her band  obviously they're going to pull that kind of stuff out  i think as the night goes on too right and that's obviously great party music uhm  she's also a very accomplished musician  she's a she's an accordion player and singer and she's really studied the accordion pretty seriously  she's gone down to louisiana and and   uh sort of played and studied under like sort of great zydeco players  but she does that bottine souriante  quebec folk band kind of thing  she sort of takes those traditions and injects some new stuff into them  particularly in this album there's i think there's actually a collaboration with some o   of the folks from the bottine souriante   and she brings what she does is she takes some of that traditional quebecois uh sound mixes that with cajun and also mixes it with uh almost rock and roll  i mean the first song on the album is a song called tealy  t&eacute;l&eacute;guid&eacute;s which is a kind of critique of the t v culture  and that's almost a an out and out rocker but then you have this sort of foot stomping traditional fiddle in   a lot of a a lot of songs  uhm part part of what's really good about it actually is martineau's very talented band which is a band called rockabayou  includes as i mentioned uhm michael ball on fiddle who's just really a a dynamite uh fiddle player  guitarist jason lange who's also very accomplished musician  and they all really come to life on stage  that's where it's really best to uh see these guys  i mean what's interesting is uhm you would think in a way mixing traditional quebecois folk music with traditional louisiana music would be an obvious uh concept there's so many uh similarities between those types of music   here's don goran now with traffic  yeah cos you don't wanna want to  be hit by a blimp  that can that can really hurt  laugh news   thanks very much don
