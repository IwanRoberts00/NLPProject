 start there  start with the presumption that even though mick has been charged with a criminal offence he sits before you an innocent man   he is a big man but an innocent man  indeed he has continued to be an innocent man throughout the whole course of this proceeding  and ladies and gentlemen he will remain an innocent man unless the prosecution mister rawls can prove or has proven to each and every one of you that mick millner is guilty of the offences that he has been charged with guilty of those offences beyond a reasonable doubt   remember that mick millner does not have to prove his innocence   he does not have to prove a single thing to you  you ladies and gentlemen by the same token don't have to do a thing  you don't have to solve the mystery   the prosecution must do all of the work and they must not simply as mister phelan put it tip the scales in their favour  where you see what does it take here to make mick millner do everything  and in word do not take away someone's liberty by suspicion or by speculation or by simply tipping the scale in their favour  the crown prosecutor has then every responsibility to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt  if after careful consideration of the evidence ladies and gentlemen  all of the evidence both that of the crown and that of the defence  if you are not sure then you must acquit my client of these charges  if you have a reasonable doubt you must acquit mister mick millner of these charges   now ladies and gentlemen some of the things that i may say to you over the next period of time will be things that perhaps mister phelan and mister barker touched on already  there is no way to get around it  it's one of the problems that's going to surface  but those things are important to my client  in addition to that there are other things that i would like to bring to your attention   let me begin by saying ladies and gentlemen that the crown has paraded before you fifteen witnesses   of those fifteen witnesses three were police officers  there was doctor rolston and word  piney the owner of riley's   those five people the police officers mister piney and doctor rolston were not eyewitnesses to what occurred that evening  the remaining ten were eyewitnesses to portions of whatever happened on the night of november the thirty-first nineteen ninety-two  of these ten seven of them had consumed alcohol in varying quantities to which would make them intoxicated to any varying degrees   only fred avalon ronald craw and mike treadle had either had nothing to drink or had very little to drink   recall the witnesses comments all of them  these people were partying  they were having a good time  there was ah free beer  there was glasses and pitchers at their table  they had a glazed look  they were staggering   a couple of them went to the automated teller machine for more money   note the way mister treadle described his friends  he said and i believe i took this down they'd been there for awhile drinking quote continues   mister craw another friend says i meet charles  fifteen minutes before i left and he was drunk   now ladies and gentlemen i'm not here to uh create evidence for you and i do make mistakes when i write things down but i do believe that those were comments that i wrote down verbatim from the witnesses  even these people these seven people admit they were drunk  glen hawker a few words   lister said ron lister i was feeling pretty happy   colleen paska i had quite a bit to drink over the whole evening   anne kramer i had five vodka specials in two hours    wanda wishaw a few words   and mister montebank mister charles montebank   i was feeling really good   don't for one minute ladies and gentlemen believe what mister  raoul eto said a few words that he was just joyful that he was two words   these individuals were intoxicated albeit to varying degrees  even mister mike treadle 's evidence i sug  i suggest is somewhat doubtful not so much because mister treadle i i think was intoxicated but because mister mister treadle doesn't give a lot of evidence about much and the evidence that he does give the actual  eye ev eye witness testimony that he does give  he gives at a point in time where he's upset  as mister avalon describes it he was frantic   he word   bear that in mind as well ladies and gentlemen of the jury when you consider what mister treadle had to say  i submit to you that the crown's strongest witnesses were two mister fred avalon and mister ron craw   together when you take just their testimonies together you have an explanation of what happened right from the fight at the washroom until  everyone's arrested at the end of the evening   the only thing that mister avalon can't testify to is what  mick millner was doing out on granada avenue but ron craw can a few words   and these two witnesses they have no connection maybe two words   mister craw doesn't know any raoul eto doesn't know mick millner   mister avalon he had a connection at one point in time  he worked there word but word  did not work there for a long period of time  mister avalon has no reason no reason whatsoever i suggest to you to say anything on behalf of these individuals because he has a vested interest in them a few words   nothing   nothing at all  ladies and gentlemen don't be fooled word   the crown is going to stand up and is going to say to you i believe is going to say to you that the evidence of these seven people and their testimony coupled with that of these other witnesses that i feel are stronger proves beyond a reasonable doubt that mick millner  committed the charges uh the the  crimes that he has been charged with   but i hope you understand what the witnesses are saying not only contradict each other but contradict what the  maybe two words   a few words   the crown wants you to believe the evidence of these people  over the evidence of four sober people  never mind that they're the accused  they're asking you to believe the evidence of those people over four sober people  that doesn't make any sense to me  as mister phelan pointed out you don't have to be an expert to explain the effects of alcohol  i'm sure that all of us at one point or another in our lives have seen someone who was intoxicated  maybe we've had a friend who's been drunk   word i suggest to a few words  perhaps you have had a friend that's been intoxicated and think about some of the things they ask you the next day when you see them again  they say where were we last night   what did what did i do  what did i say  did i embarrass myself  did i embarrass you  you know these are things that that uh a person who is intoxicated uh will have questions about the next day  well what does that show  it shows that to a certain extent and again a few words  but to a certain extent alcohol will cloud a person's memory  and effect their recall  there's no question of that   ladies and gentlemen the crown's evidence that they are trying to or that they are entering before you is just that it's evidence of seven key witnesses that's tainted by alcohol   ask yourself this question who is going to have a better recollection a clearer recollection of past events someone who was sober at the time or someone who was drunk   i think the answer to that question is obvious   now don't get me wrong  i'm not saying that the witnesses are lying  i'm not saying that by any stretch of the imagination  i'm simply saying that they are confused  their memories are cloudy   they're confused about the sequence of events  maybe they're confused about who they saw doing what   and to a certain extent on some occasions they are confused as to who was actually word   let's examine the evidence now ladies and gentlemen  i like mister barker 's four scenarios   situations but since i'm defending mick millner i have to add a fifth one  let me say to you that it it seems to me that there are five areas  the first one is the washroom   the second one is the coat check area   the third one is granada avenue   the fourth one is ninety-third street   i have to discuss that because there's been an allegation that  mick did something on ninety-third street  and finally the hallway incident   let's start with that washroom incident   who actually saw what went on in there   think about that when you're analyzing the whole situation   the washroom incident raoul eto he says he got hit in the side of the head  he got a couple more blows  he doesn't know who hit him   ron lister who's sitting right there at the table the table above the area where this fight was was  uh taking place he's watching the whole thing what he says is all big guys uh all the big guys did was pull everyone apart and take them to the coat check   that's all they did   anne kramer she was sitting off to the side a little a little ways away  maybe three words bar and one guy went after raoul   raoul and this guy went at him   wanda wishaw said raoul threw one guy up against the railing  neither guy threw any punches   and ron craw said mick he saw mick run in but he couldn't see much because there were people in the way  and that's really all that he saw   but these other four people  you'll note of these other four people not one not one of those people said that any of these big guys or any of the barmen or any of the accused hit mister raoul eto not one   now we know from the testimony right it appears from the evidence in the testimony that mister eto was bleeding at this point in time either from his mouth or his ear   there's nothing word   someone hit him   who who hit him  well it's very possible that he hit him   according to the testimony that i just read just a few portions  three or four words was one of the other questions    mister millner was not involved at this point in time  now from the coat or from  from the washroom area to the coat check area most people think nothing happened   mister eto was whisked away  and i believe the evidence of the accused is that it was mister uh  wasylesko mister frank wasylesko and mister johnny steen took him to the coat check and then mick followed them up  but there are two ladies anne kramer and wanda wishaw who say that something happened in that hallway  they say that someone hit raoul eto right in front of their table down there on the word down on the  word   and i believe one of them indicated that they thought that it was  mick millner or i d'd mick millner as the fellow that had him there although that particular lady couldn't say whether or not  two words   i suggest to you that what that lady  what those two ladies </} saw actually did take place but it di dn't take place right there in the hallway  it took place up at the coat check area   these ladies were sitting there  they were looking down the hallway  they said they could see it   that's where they saw it  that's where that happened  that's where they saw mister eto get into an altercation  with my client at the coat check area  so there's just one example of how what they're saying may not be  or uh i'm not saying that it's not correct but i'm saying that they're mistaking as to where exactly that happened   i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that occurred at the coat check area   now mister millner didn't have any reason whatsoever to hit mister eto at that point  none whatsoever  he didn't have any reason at all  nothing to do with it  when he got to the situation everything was under control   but at the coat check area he word   my client got up on the stand and told you what happened at the coat check area   and when you when you contrast what my client had to say about what happened at the coat check area with what the witnesses say well a again  i'm confused
