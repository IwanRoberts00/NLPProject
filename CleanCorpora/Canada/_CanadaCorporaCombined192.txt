lethbridge talkin' talking about how he liked the increase of forechecking and uh just before that uh call on frank esposito that was their first shift in this whole hockey game and that they did some good forechecking and then they had the bears hemmed up in their own end for a minute and a half there and uh  but other than that there's there's only snow on the one end cos that was their only shift of the hockey game so far  yeah the zamboni was not getting much in the way of work down in by dale masson   well we'll see what happens here as the pronghorns work on the power play they have the puck  kelln from the right point flips in it on goal  pad save by masson   they steer that to the corner  now zukiwsky   back to the left point for harper   over to kelln on the right side   kelln back to harper   in for gatto moves in  lets a shot go  oh my god  zukiwsky had a wide open gaping net   unclear word   and he failed to tap it in  thirty-seven goals this year and he missed that one  i can't believe it  kelln now up on the left side for zukiwsky  steps in across the line   back to kelln  moving in  lets a shot go  saved by masson  he's stopped the rebound   it's cleared ahead

behind him   aye they're tacklin' 'em tackling them  good down there aren't they jeff   good action  holy smokes   i'm gonna going to look down at the bench and see wilkey there in a second  it's fired down in the bears' zone  christiansen crashed into the boards  christiansen still tied up  gatto tripped up by christiansen  slow laugh   that was a flagrant foul   and they tie it up in the bears' zone  this is a real slugfest here  beautiful   i don't think that you're allowed to do that  stick your skate out from behind you and trip a guy but hal got away with the one there and   haney and strand had a two-one zip  word   and haney passed to strand and i think cavilla actually got his left pad down to block the pass partly but holy smokes  word   great play  but di they did have a backcheck word   just at the last moment and he took strand out of the play  a good play by hainey  good play good play   o on the positive side the bears able to dodge the bullet  boy lethbridge passed that puck around  nice   oh man   yeah   and uh masson was fightin' fighting   for dear life  he was wiped out a couple times on his back   i don't know who knocked him over  strand has it  it's under five minutes to play in the first period  it's three nothing  long lead pass for hainey   went off his stick   he's got it in behind that lethbridge net  tryna trying to one-hand it out front  esposito back to hainey  he gets hauled over by wobick   and disowicz has it now for lethbridge   he'll clear off the glass down the ice  christiansen'll go back to play it  burns is forechecking him   carpenter fires it back into the alberta zone   cleared down the ice by adair  back to play it is wobick icing against alberta  three fifty-three left in the first   the score three nothing   alberta in front  frank esposito with a couple of goals and a minor penalty   and terry degner has the other goal   they've staked the bears to a three nothing lead  espos one of his two came on the power play  and the bears kill off the first power play for lethbridge uh  not without uh excitement for the crowd  and uh this has been uh just carryover from last night  some great hockey being played  dale's in on the faceoff in his own zone  glad you could be along for this one   on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight point five i'm evan bok along with jeff rankin   should there be a game three tomorrow we're on with our pregame at seven o'clock once again   from the clare drake   degner will faceoff now against tyler graham   graham won it back  back to the point  leroux shot gets through  saved by masson  gave up a big rebound but he gloves a shot by graham  and looks like a penalty coming up   and i believe it's against the bears again  a   and a good penalty there  terry degner he he uh lost  th the draw got lost sorry by dean tiltgen  degner had his guy and his guy just got away from him a bit  the rebound came right to him and degner hadda   had to do sump'in something   or the or a guy's all alone in in  the slot by himself and uh  if there is a good penalty that's one because uh degner took away a good scoring chance   terry degner for holding in sixteen thirteen  so he has a goal and a penalty too now   thirty uh three forty-seven to go in the first period  and the pronghorns will go on their second power play of the night  bears are in front   protecting a three nothing lead   aaron zarowny will take the faceoff against zukiwsky   horns won it  reider back to the point to kelln  back to reider   reider's pass was blocked and aaron zarowny clears it down the ice  jarret zukiwsy likes to stand right on the doorstep of masson   try and get in his way  that's his job a of course  long lead pass to gatto  gets it in to reider  he moves in shoots  saved by masson  but it's offside   that was a good call for the bears  i'm not sure about that one uh   jarret zukiwsky again complaining to the ref  uh the good news for the bears is they've gone four periods and the only goal zukiwsky's scored was a cheesy one   but i guess the bad news is i is   he gonna going to break out and start potting  'em them right 'n' and  left because uh he's a prolific goal-scorer and uh the bears just  gotta got to keep doing a good job on 'im  him like they have   coach daum sends out aaron zarowny gainst  against simpson   troy hjertaas trevor sherban to defend this horn power play   and harper has it off the draw at centre ice for lethbridge  over to kelln  now ahead to reider  he's squashed by trevor sherban and the bears clear down the ice  sherban walked up on that play and let 'im  him have it   good hit again  the bears' physical presence has been the best all year tonight  here's harper with it from his own end  skates to centre  lead pass to zukiwsky   he knocked it down but simpson got to it and hammered it the length   a minute ten to go in the pronghorn power play   here they go  kelln ahead to zukiwsky  splits the defence  moves in  saved  masson  what a nice stop that was   they made the blocker save  and there it was  zukiwsky  they they uh  a set play  a beautiful pass  put the deke all alone  and there comes dale masson  he's not the best goalie in the league for nothing and uh   big save for 'im him cos uhm   a goal in the last three minutes would get the pronghorns right back in this hockey game  beautiful stop off the leading goalscorer in the canada west this year  and the last three   jarret zukiwsky   that's what ya you like to see a showdown between the top members of this league   ya you had it right there and dale masson robbed him   and if you wanna want to watch a power play breakout you wanna want to watch that last one  you have that one taped could be 'on tape'  cos that one was uh pretty to watch  esposito against zukiwsky on the faceoff  a minute one to go on the power play  here's a long blast  saved masson  a nice glove stop that time off of jeremy riehl  and jarret zukiwsky in there paying the price in front of the net   hm   he's paying a price but if you're playing to the referee every time  if you're gonna going to go there you're gotta got to pay the price and   look j hopefully mccory gets tired of this  i mean you can't whine to the ref if you're gonna   going to go to the net every play  you don't book a room in a five-star hotel and then  complain cos it costs more than a one-star  there you go   that's the best i could do without mentioning names  you know   laugh i don't want any lawsuits   not bad at all not bad at all   hello in sarcastic voice   two and a half to go in the first   three nothing  the bears in front of the horns   horns still in the power play  riehl fires it deep into the zone  pullishy checked by zukiwsky  o'rourke comes up with it  behind the net   looking for someone to pass to   to the right circle it goes to riehl  back to the point  it comes out to centre ice   riehl has it there   flips it deep into the bears' zone  masson sets it up for goodkey behind the net  goodkey takes the hit  lost the puck  gatto has it   gatto out front for riehl  his blast  wide of the net   o'rourke behind the net now  for gatto  nine seconds left in the power play  gatto steps out  back to the right point for riehl  his shot   deflected wide of the net   o'rourke is hit hard by pullishy  it ends up underneath o'rourke   and zukiwsky comes in and lays the body on pullishy and that'll do it   as degner steps out of the box we have a minute forty-five to go in the first period and uh fans here give the bears a rousing applause laugh   i thought they were going to anyways  some of them were  the uh p
