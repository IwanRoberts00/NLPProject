has been a lot of pressure on allan rock to drop the compulsory registration of all firearms from his gun control bill  several provinces' gun organizations and the canadian medical association have said registration will not cut down on deaths or injuries from firearms  they argue the money the government will spend on gun registration should go to other areas of crime control  brian johnson of the reform party made the same argument in the house of commons as he questioned rock about the gun bill  registration will do nothing to curb crime  why doesn't he scrap that whole idea and save the taxpayers a lot of dollars  if i were to do such a thing i would disappoint the strongest supporters of registration  the chiefs of police of this country  the front-line police officers  the canadian

available to be back in court ahead of schedule  so on thursday the crown attorney will lay out his case before the jury  he'll explain what evidence he intends to produce against bernardo and sometime later in the day he'll call his first witness  much of the detail of this case has been under court-ordered wraps for more than two years  but starting thursday as the case is presented in
