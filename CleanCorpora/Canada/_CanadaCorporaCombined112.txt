 mhh hmm  uhm you know he talks about for instance that   that uhm uhh cultures uh immigrants  who are widely dispersed in a new country are apt to lyu   lose their language uhm because of the uhh lack of contact  uh within their group  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and if you follow that through  and that's why i brought in the australian stuff  you will see that uhm they soon lose their language  now you probably don't have these books cos they were published in australia  ohh  and just ignore all that stuff  but michael klein did a lot work on uhm  uhh on this whole question in australia with many languages  language ecology maintenance ah shift ah domains and issues of language maintenance structure of migrant languages   and then of course he was working up to a language policy for australia  ohh   and uh eventually   so he developed it  i don't   no but he worked closely with joe lo bianco and this is actually their uhm the policy   net the commonwealth  you see in australia they have a federal government which  is called the commonwealth and so it's the central government which is located in canberra  ya   then each state has its own provincial uhm legislature  the way we do  however they do have in australia a commonwealth department of education which is used for policy- makin  making for uh education and in this case languages  oh   and i think that if you uh read this you will see a tremendously civilized way of looking at languages and of respecting  uh languages and not feeling that they're going to be a  a tearing apart force in the country  oh  one of the things that is very very important about australia and their policy on languages is they have no official language   oh   oh that's interesting   and they said that they  in fact joe lo bianco told me he said we learn from canada how divisive having official languages can be  and so uh you'll see in here that they respect all languages  they help to promote them  there are some tremendous uhm there's tremendous support for languages in schools  now do you have a copy of my article on uhm  language policy in the antipodes  nope   no  i don't know if i can't put my hand on it right away  that would be nice   it's well it's in a journal in the library  i'll be able to find it there  ya  uh do  it's ahh  is it called language policy in   i i think eh i know it's got  antipodes in it  language policy in the antipodes  language policy down under something like that  uhm and it's in that one was in the c a a l  you know the canadian association of applied linguistics   journal  okay   mhh hmm  and it's quite old now  uhm it's probably about eighty-seven but  i'm not positive on that  mhh hmm   but i do have  if you're going to be around the university i'll just make a note and uhh i know i have copies of it at home that i can put my hand on immediately  that might be easier  it's really hard to get on the c d rom in the library at this time  they're booked like  the the one that's uh you know the one that   has the the journals i need is always booked cos it's ah it's joined with some  arts   kind of index as well   ya   ya   i'll about three words  no problem   so if i could come pick that up maybe tomorrow or  yes  now where do you live  i live uhm just in between saint-laurent and saint-denis uh close to duluth right in the plateau sort of area  okay   okay okay   they're very close to like the  uh sherbrooke metro  ya   all right because i'm at the v&ecircumflex;ndome metro  oh you live near hannah   yes  ya  and i'm right in in westmount  and if you uhm   tomorrow i've got to go and see a student uh somewhere  uh i can't remember where laugh   laugh i'm not surprised  laugh   saint-urbain and laugh you know   wait a minute saint-urbain and   ya and uh bernard   and uh that's where i get the bus   bernard  where is bernard  it's farther north  it's farther north  oh ya ya i think i know where that is   all right   that's quite far from where i am but uh  saint-urbain's close  yes uhm   but where are  ah if you're going to be in i could almost drop it off in your box on on in your mail  like is it an apartment or is it even possible  oh   ya i'm just thinking that's uh  is it on your way  would you be taking saint-denis   i have to go downtown afterwards  ya   like if you take saint-laurent uhm  mhh hmm   i can't take saint-laurent down cos it's a one-way up  oh you're going  i'm going to be up at bernard you see   oh you're coming back that way  you're going to drop it off on your way back to town   yes   uhm you could take saint-denis and then you go to rue french pronounciation of this as: " ju" or [ zh]  r o y   to go turn right and you go about three or four blocks to the street i live on  mhh hmm   ya   it's called saint-hubert s t   oh yes i know that  and uh you go then you have to go   right  you have to go back to go north on it because it's a one-way street  and the address is thirty forty rue   saint-hubert number one number one  all right   okay  uh any idea what time that would be   uh no  i could phone you tonight and tell you  that would help because i like to get to the library  i don't work well at home  yes   i just fiddle around and have coffee  word   well it it'll certainly  it won't be until eleven thirty or something  well i can wait well   eleven thirty  but you see i'm sure i'm going to see this woman  at nine thirty so  it'll be   that's okay   oh that's okay   eleven thirty's fine  is it  ya ya  i was just thinking if it's later in the afternoon  i'll i know what'll happen to me  no no no   it's my own it's my own fault you know not being disciplined enough to work at home but  i know i just i  get here it's like going to my job  ya   mhh hmm   laugh you know i i go to that  library and things occur to me  yes yes   and i think i'm just so used to working there that's where  my thinking kicks in laugh   and no derac no distractions as well   no i'd really like to read that  and so i could use things  ah there's things in there about language and i   and ethnic identity   it talks about uhm uh australia and new zealand and england  mhh  and but it it   it looks more at the at  psychological or sociological reasons for language policies and what actually happens in education  but i think you'll you an underlying context   is certainly uhm respect for ethnic identity or non-respect for  so uh ya  ya  now how do you want how do you think you want to develop this  well i took a stab at it because i thought   i've got i've been doing this reading and i needed to  good   i'm glad you asked me to do the annotated bibliography because i found it much easier to remember what i'd read which goes back to february doesn't it  that's right  and i found that i could rea   really i could really i had sort of a global view of uh i mean sort of a main idea global  picture of what was in the article  so that was a really good thing to do  mhh   mhh hmm   often you know i'm reading a lot of articles  and i forget   i've had many students say that ya   ya   so just maybe three words    they say annotated bibliography i  hated doing it  but it was really useful   ya   oh i didn't  i i didn't hate doing it  and it's it's good forever you know  you you'll be able to tackle  ya   so you've actually written something up for me  super   ya you know and i've related   like i've this is just this can be completely changed uhm but i  what i i avoided i guess in a way  uhm you know the factors and variables that uh are listed  it's not in this book  it's in the other one i think   mhh hmm   the uhm the things that are grouped  i just fou found   i found that was that there were too many variables and factors for me to to deal with  i i just it it's it's a  like it's good but when i was writing my paper i just thought i was going to get into this uh whole analysis of what leads to loss and what leads to maintenance again  mhh hmm   and i wanted to look at it differently  i wanted to look at language and identity and  what what is what is that all about  okay   so uhm anyway  this is what i did  so if i word to   all right   so what tell me what   path you've taken   okay so uhm anyway i just   i don't know  you might wanna want to just read that over uhm  eh i'm not happy with it  it's not it's definitely  something i want to change  mhh hmm   but what i wanted to look at first in the first section was what is the le word   language express  and there's one article i read by romaine i think from the  fish's point of view where she she   goes into that  mhh hmm   and edwards he critiques some people's views because he says well they're members of a minority group so they have a biased point of view  they're not subjective  oh yes   and now it's time that we have a more  objective point of view  yes   and uh so i wanted to kind of look at that issue like uhm  what is it that expresses that   the inside outside   ya the unique point of view uhm and a different experience from the minority and the majority  mhh   so that was what i dealt with in one section  okay  and i haven't put romaine's in here yet  i i'm just sort of going through that article on again on a second or third time  mhh hmm   then i thought you know like for minority uhm you know we think we're con we're giving this   kind of concessionary policy  mhh   that came out of one of the articles too  say we're well we'll let you keep your language kind of kind of   yes yes   that's the perspective of the majority  but for a minority uh i just learned this this year that bilingualism is not necessarily something that's going to guarantee that they keep their language and culture because it's like this intermediary step  between uhm keeping it and  and   being in completely assim assim  assimilation ya   mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm mhh hmm   right maintenance or transitional into the other into assimilation   so i wanted to discuss those concepts and diglossia   because it was mentioned by fishman i think that   he goes that diglossia without bilingualism  provides a stable enduring language arrangment and i thought  that's not true for minorities and it's criticized by someone else as well  in here   yes   so uh bilingualism a bit diglossia a bit and the  and then i into this concept of multiculturalism or   pluralism   ya   ya   i don't know   it seems too many things laugh   but i i i think you've you one of the things that's very important though to do is to give some definitions to your terminology   because i'm sure as you read through  the literature you saw that people are not always using the same  with the same meanings  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  now what does hinton mean about  diglossia and bilingualism   i went to baker for   i mean what's your definition of diglossia  oh so you'd like me to put in there what he's meaning by  diglossia as opposed to what baker  mhh
