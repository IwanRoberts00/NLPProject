 so they have to they have to drive down that morning or they have to rent a hotel room for the night before with all their stuff that they're bringing back from christmas   oh   i   now does everybody   not everybody registers at ten o'clock  uh well our class does  mkay okay   like our course rec does  mm hmm   that sounds very confusing  it's stupid  like martha lives in residence  mm hmm  and uh we have a three hour drive  mkay okay   so i mean we could leave in the morning it's not like that big a deal but we'd have to leave pretty early to get here for ten  yeah but you'd be three words from anywhere like that would be hard pressed to get there for ten breath   mm hmm  geez  that's right  so   breath well that sounds just like us here so i   dunno don't know   register by phone and you know you've only got certain times of the day that you can call to register  starting at you know certain times of the month   it's weird   yeah i wish we could register by phone  i was lucky to get registered this year laugh   yeah  well i know it's always been difficult  my sister always had a hard time registering too  she always had to like she had to go um  like on registration day she had to go register for all her different courses   mkay okay   and um a lot of times she couldn't get the courses she wanted cos they'd already be booked up  even though she'd go and like she'd go first thing in the morning   yeah   cos you had to if you wanted to get that course   same thing happened to me laugh   see for us like since we're in the rec program   mm hmm  like all our courses are mandatory  mkay okay   so we have a set schedule and everybody who's in rec  does the same courses and   hmm interesting   so you've always got someone to study with  yeah  laugh   mm yep i do   sigh   sigh deduh deduh deduh  what breath i dunno don't know   thinking  sigh yes it's been a  two words   sigh stop thinkin thinking  about that laugh   and i have to fr i have to  renew my n l s national lifeguard service too   and i wanna want to do it like  before christmas   i don't know if i can two words to do it though  what do you have to go home to do that or  yeah   and how long would it take  well it depends who i get  if i get pam the bitch who i used to work for   mm hmm  she'll probably make me do the whole weekend  if i went to ottawa i could be done in two hours  mkay okay   so i might do that  i might go home for the weekend   drive down to ottawa   it's only a two hour drive to otta    yeah   well an hour and a half to ottawa so   mm hmm   it's not that big a deal to drive into ottawa do the thing and then come back because   one of the guys that uhm is in my rec course he's also a lifeguard  mm hmm  and uhh he said in ottawa you don't have to do situations  mkay okay   and like that means like they have you stand in the pool and all the rest  there's a whole bunch of people in the pool and they pretend to have someone drown  alright  and you have to save them  that's what a situation is  yeah  and those are the worst things right because they're so non-real like   okay   i can't explain it to you but it's just so fake that   it's ridiculous  laugh   and not only that but like you're y  you you're tense right from like as soon as you stand on the deck because you know something's gonna going to   happen  mkay okay   and it's probably gonna going to be something major cause it's an n l s  it's probably gonna going to be a spinal or a head injury or you know  something that you probably wouldn't see  no you'd see it but it's just something that you   it's really big to deal with and   mm hmm   so you're like  and sometimes it's not even sometimes it's just like a weak swimmer or something and that you have to throw them  a fut flutto a flutter board but you know like it's just it just it puts like so much stress on you  mkay okay   it's not the same as normal guarding cos i save people and i don't it's not the same kind of stress as when you know it's gonna going to happen  well as soon as it happens it's you know you don't think  you're in there and up you go   you're programmed yeah exactly   exactly you're programmed but when you know what's gonna  going to happen and you're waiting for it to happen then like there's a million things running through your mind  so it's not a real life   situation  no   but so i might do that  i told jim to find out when the next one is and  we'd do it together  hey sounds good  yeah  that way you could work next summer at cadet camp yay  yeah maybe i'll do   the camp  well cos i need a job obviously  mm hmm   and uhm  you have to pay for those nights out at sassy's right   laugh   uh huh   i dunno don't know but for some reason whenever i was at sassy's hardly any money came out of my pocket so   laugh ah except for that one night where it's like i walk in damon let me buy you a drink i'm like okay laugh   yeah there was that one night  sniff oh i still remember that geez  stumbling back into the t   yeah walking up the hill with you on my shoulders after i'd ripped my pants  that was good laugh   you know what that stupid fly just landed on my floor  kill it  start whisper i'll try but i don't know if i can get him quite from here end whisper   hey you living on the second floor of a house  yeah  mkay okay   and you just have a room to yourself that's all  oh i got him yes  woohoo   congratulations   what  congratulations  thanks  laugh starts hold on a second okay laugh ends   pause for about 10 seconds   woohoo   now he won't be annoying me  laugh   he was driving me insane  i have a fluorescent light on my ceiling and he just kept bumping into it  and you know that buzzing noise they make it started  to get really aggravating   yeah   so he's gone yay  laugh   and i didn't even like squash him i just stunned him  mm hmm  woohoo  cos i didn't wanna want to squash him on my rug  and so where is he now  he's i squished him up into my garbage can  he's probably still alive and could come out  no  d'ya do you think  maybe  if he isn't dead if you just stunned him yeah  kay okay i'll watch  laugh   laugh   i can see you're gonna going to be very busy for the rest of the evening  laugh well i won't watch that long  i'll watch for like a minute  i don't think he is cos he's wrapped up in a kleenex  ah he'll work his way through  if he's if he's stunned he'll work his way through  flies are hardy creatures i'm telling you   so this room that you're in do you have your own way in there or is i what   no  come in through the front door up the stairs  yeah  gotta got to be quiet when you come in at three in the morning  yeah cos um her room is right beside my room  mkay okay   so   but it's pretty nice cos i have a couch and a chair and a little coffee table and a t v and my computer desk and my dresser and my bed and  mkay okay   my two dressers and my bed  sounds like a very big room  what  sounds like a very big room  it is a big room it's very big  cozy  laugh cozy  there's so much furniture in there it has to be cozy laugh  and my fridge  i forgot my fridge  ah geez laugh   yeah  sounds good  you prefer that to residence or  yeah definitely  why  residence is loud  mm hmm  it's five minutes away from school and buses don't run on sundays and it tase it takes ten bucks  to get into town from residence  and buses stop running at eleven  mkay okay   but it's five minutes  is that what you said  it's five minutes from the school  okay  it's about twenty minutes from town  ah i understand  and so where you are now how far how long   does it take you to get to school  i catch the bus at about twenty-five after and i get there at quarter-to  that's not too bad  yeah  hmm okay  so i don't mind that  you're sort of like well no you're not like me  laugh   no i'm not   ten minutes i'm downtown ten minutes i'm at school  okay  yeah well cos i can walk downtown in in   ten minutes easy  mm hmm  and that's where i catch the bus  but i usually catch a bus from here to downtown anyway cos   you're lazy  well it doesn't cost me any more  true  and   laugh you get to sleep in an extra five minutes laugh   no actually i probly probably  could get down there faster if i walked because what i do is i get all ready to go and i look at the clock and i think oh geez i better go catch the bus  cos i'm always afraid i'm gonna going to   miss it  laugh   so i go out there and then i wait for like ten minutes and then i'm like fuck why am i out here so early  laugh   but   alright  so i probably would get there faster er  it probably wouldn't take me as much time   mm hmm  if i walked  oh well   but i walk home every night so i figure that's my good deed   and i i have phys ed  physical education three times a week monday wednesday and friday  okay   so   and we do sit-ups and push-ups and running and  word and stuff   that keeps you busy   yeah so it keeps me pretty active so  and also tomorrow night i'm going to go to the arena and see about starting skating again down here  mkay okay   cos my mom said she'd pay for it so   not that i'm doing it just to get some money out of her or anything like that   laugh   i'd like to try and finish my word   anything your parents pay for take it  laugh word from the wise laugh   but uh it's just cos i uhm wanna want to  try and finish my last test  mm hmm  i think that would be a good idea and uh well i think i can do it so  well how much time do you have to for   your last test  well i can take as long as i want  mkay okay   and then after that what can you do  whatever i want  can teach or  i i taught last year  okay  in deep river  but uhm it goes something like this  finishing all your tests is kind of like having like a university doctorate  okay  and uh you know finishing like a couple of them is like going to like grade school high school kinda kind of   thing and  ah  it's just  so obviously you're gonna going to get paid more the more tests you have the more experience you have  i understand   it works like that so   i did a year of coaching already and uh i was getting paid twenty dollars an hour then  impressive  yeah for starting right so  who knows maybe i won't work at the cadet camp next summer maybe i'll be coachin coaching somewhere  maybe  that might be good for you  yeah  actually you know that job was like the best thing to do for the course i'm going into  okay  cos it totally  i still don't ah shit  what  whenever i talk to you i always remember about my canoeing course and that i haven't received anything saying that i passed it and i need it  like i'd really like to have something to say i passed my first like my canoe instructor  mm hmm  ah i'm gonna going to have to get a hold of someone down there   anyways uhm because totally like everyone in my class either like worked with handicapped kids worked as a lifeguard worked as something but i worked as like a recreation person you know  yeah  like i was totally like everything
