 how could he be looking for the knife kicking  why would he be looking for the knife and kicking  he went out there very focused on one thing  john steen 's out there and there's this guy with a knife  he went out and he helped john steen and he found the knife and that's all he did   and independent witnesses and a number of them i suggest ladies and gentlemen a number of people have confirmed that there were a number of people on the street and no one no one has stated that they saw  herbert wasylesko kick or strike raoul eto any time that evening but for sure on the street  nobody   to the hallway the fourth area that herbert wasylesko  was involved in i suppose in the whole scheme of things from all the evidence you've heard  well the evidence of herbert wasylesko is he and  john steen brought raoul eto into the hallway area  and herbert said he then left to go out to the coat check  he further states that he stuck his head in once maybe twice  i'm not sure what he said on that point  and at no point did he see anything going on in the hallway  i think all the evidence suggests you've got four people in the hallway  you've got frank with mister eto   you've got hawker and mister montebank   that's it  fred avalon fred avalon supports that   he knows somebody was in the coat check  i believe he kind of said by assumption it had to be herbert  because there was nobody else left around unaccounted for  and herbert told you directly yes i was in the coat check   and there's not one witness crown or defence not one witness here who has herbert wasylesko in that in that hallway kicking or striking raoul eto   the evidence is he's in there twice   he's in there obviously the first time when he brings mister  eto in with john steen   that ties in nicely with what mister millner said that that hallway area was to be used if you will as a detention area a holding cell until the police came  he brings him in  the situation's under control  he leaves  when does he come back  he comes back when the police are coming in to help his brother to pick up raoul eto to have him ready for the police to arrest  word   that's when herbert wasylesko is in the room   those are the four areas ladies and gentlemen that i wanted  to to deal with  and i'm sure like i said there's certainly more evidence  i mean i haven't tried to condense the trial into fifteen minutes  but i want to now briefly turn to a few other kind of overall things  just when you're assessing the whole case and what makes sense and what doesn't there's a couple things i'd like you to think about   the first one i i'd mentioned a bit earlier   most of the crown witnesses had been drinking   now certainly the five involved if you will  when i say the five involved i mean the five at the table   there was evidence i believe it was from mister craw that mister montebank was actually staggering   i believe tom dytmer had indicated that everybody there was having a good time  it was bloodshot eyes glassy   look at raoul eto 's behaviour that night  can you infer from his behaviour that he was sober   the point is this what we've got is five individuals at the table for sure who are fairly drunk and that is obviously going to affect their recollection of a lot of events  i think if you recall my friend mister phelan had gone through some of those things  for instance a few words et cetera  that's something to keep in mind  you've got the crown witnesses are all drunk  defence witnesses are all sober  they're there doing their job   raoul eto   raoul eto was there in the room  the police come in and what does he say to them then   nothing  now let's be logical here  if raoul eto had been subjected to a vicious beating in that room why wouldn't he right away as soon as the police come in start hollering about it  he's not hollering about it  they have to put him in cuffs to get him out  why did they put him in cuffs  i think we can infer he was upset   he was still rambunctious  he was mad  he was drunk  he was furious  and about two hours later approximately constable reif  comes by  and it was either constable holden or constable walker  ladies and gentlemen who said yeah i knew when we were going back that arrests were going to be made   what do we got here  we've got constable reif coming to arrest  he knows there's been an incident with a knife  he comes takes raoul eto   mister montebank i believe walks him under his own  word   two hours later we've got constable reif back  who's he arresting   he's arresting people   he's arresting people who raoul eto has identified  well who's raoul eto identifying   anybody working that night  who hasn't he identified throughout all the rest of his  evidence  he has never identified the people who he says are doing  this supposed violence to him  certainly he does not ever say herbert wasylesko did anything to me  he never said herbert wasylesko did anything to  charles montebank   constable reif has the opportunity to talk to an intoxicated mister eto an intoxicated mister montebank an intoxicated partner and the intoxicated two words  and goes roaring back and arrests everybody  now think about this   herbert wasylesko said he gave the knife to constable  reif   john steen says herbert wasylesko gave the knife to constable reif   where did the knife go  well we know herbert had it in his jeans   i believe he said he has put it in his pocket   now i point out constable reif did have notes  a few words that night  i'm sure he said that in his examination two words  yeah i word have notes of everything that has happened in the back   he says that it was john who gave him the knife  that doesn't make sense  herbert does it  herbert goes up to him when he first comes into the room gives him the knife   constable reif at that point is i want to get this  raoul eto arrested and out of here because of what he's done  here today   why would herbert wasylesko do that  if he'd done something wrong that night if he'd done something wrong that night he wouldn't want to be anywhere around  constable reif when he came in  he wouldn't want to try to explain what happened   for the exact same reason i suggest that mister phelan  put to you  he'd want to disassociate himself   he doesn't want to have nothing to do with raoul eto   raoul eto again  raoul eto stated he had the knife with him for the purposes of self-defence  but i remind you ladies and gentlemen one person that night was wielding a knife   that was raoul eto   that had nothing to do with self-defence  raoul eto the kind of a man you'll recall who defends himself with his mouth and then he bites the guy   what happened that evening after raoul eto  stuck the knife into the tire certainly not in self-defence and he's running around outside the establishment with a knife  now steen goes out to assist  now steen is herbert wasylesko 's boss  herbert wasylesko goes out to assist  they're going to get and find the guy with the knife bring him back in and let the police deal with him  and what does all the evidence point to happening  herbert finds the knife  herbert helps mister steen bring mister eto  back in and the police come   that's exactly consistent with everything that all the witnesses stated   the point i raised earlier  i'd spoken about the point at which mister herbert wasylesko was holding mister eto at the front area the coat check you recall  do you believe ladies and gentlemen that herbert wasylesko who was at that point at the coat check area calm doing his job restraining somebody who wants to get involved in a little bit of a fracas all of the sudden bang going crazy   all of the sudden he changes from being a corny expression i'll use it anyway a clean-cut young man  two and a half years university  he's had a steady job at quik-e-mart for years  he's a businessman  he's got his own establishment  all of the sudden this guy who not two minutes before was reasonable and acting appropriately goes crazy in conjunction i point out with three other individuals   it's just unbelievable  it just doesn't make sense  why would why would herbert wasylesko act that way   the last thing about mister eto i'd like to touch on ladies and gentlemen at this point he's given you some estimates of time throughout the course of the word which i'd suggest to you are just totally just totally word   i believe you recall in the examination in chief he said he had been at word for about an hour and a half when the first skirmish broke out   all the other witnesses i thought indicated that time frame was about three hours   mister eto says to you it felt like i was in that hallway ten or fifteen minutes before the police arrived   let's take the same timeline and extrapolate that to when constable reif word there  a few words down the hallway  he got there right away  with that ladies and gentlemen even if you want to give  raoul eto the benefit of the doubt it's certainly clear that his recollection is unreliable   it certainly appears that he's had his agenda as mister  phelan said   in summary ladies and gentlemen i just leave you with this  i suggest it's very clear very clear on all the evidence you've heard over past weeks that herbert wasylesko is an innocent man and had nothing to do with anything  i ask you to return a verdict acquitting him of the charges he's facing silence, about 40 seconds   okay thank you my lord  ladies and gentlemen of the jury  this is the second time that i've had the pleasure of addressing you and it is the final time that i get to address you and explain to you and set forth for you what my client word in this case  and ladies and gentlemen if i recall back to my opening i believe i neglected to introduce myself at that point in time  let me take that opportunity now  my name is gerald fedor   i work with a firm called stewart and company based in  macaroon and my client is mister mick millner   when you were sworn as jurors in this case each of you undertook a duty to give mick millner not just mick millner to give all of the accused cough a fair trial  you undertook that you would give this case the same anxious  consideration and accord him a fair trial and afford him the same presumption of innocence and the same benefit of a reasonable doubt that you if you any of you were in this word would have a right to expect at the hands of twelve of your uh fellow citizens  these principles of the presumption of innocence of reasonable doubt that myself and mister phelan before me and mister barker  before me and i'm sure mister fincher after me will  indicate to you have been tried and tested in our courts of law and they have withstood all challenges  anyone can be charged with a criminal offence and they may very well be innocent   that is why the jury system is one of the cornerstones of our  society  the jury system stands between the power and the state and the members of the public  it stands between the power of the state and you and i  word   in a very short while ladies and gentlemen you will you twelve people will retire to commence the serious duty that you're sworn or  word to undertake  the decision which you will ultimately make and it is an  important decision will affect my client's life  there's no question about that   where are you going to begin  where do you begin with the examination  our system of justice gives you a starting point  may i suggest that that starting point is this presumption of innocence
