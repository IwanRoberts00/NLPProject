 and we have a magnetic hill that's just on a concession road that just not everyone knows about  you do   mhh hmm  that that i understand cos i've   talk talked   i haven't seen it but other people who've seen the one in new brunswick that's a big deal and there's postcards and everything said that  it's it's ah  better  ya a better effect  mhh  cos there's nothing around eh  there's no just just the uh   the optical illusion   ya   it really really works too  mhh  but  so did uhm  oh i forget what i was gonna going to  say laugh   what so what's cool about your hometown  if you were gonna going to take  somebody around   the people   laugh you go around and introduce them to people  ya i could do that too   laugh   there's a word of characters   oh i know what do the what do the   young people do in the on the  weekends  what do people do on the weekends in your town   where in st thomas   uhm they go to london london, ontario laugh    laugh   they get out of town  they drink a lot  there's a lot of bars there   but when you but when you  were young they didn't do that did they  when i was young uh well we have uh uhm a resort or whatever like the lake lake erie is just maybe fifteen minutes south of town   so especially in the summer every  weekend we'd go down  to  you know go swimming or   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   okay   yes we have grand lake yes   there was a great big huge dancehall there so every weekend we'd go down to the dances there  hmm   the stork club  mhh hmm  it was supposed to be the second biggest uh dancefloor in north america or something  it had springs in the floor and guy lombardo used to play there all the time  ohh  ya ya  and there was it was really big in those days because the railroads were  it stopped when i was young but but  my parents and you know people that came before them  yes people were traveling   actually port stanley was owned by london and st thomas was in the middle and there was a railroad from london to port stanley  it was called the l and p s  yes   mhh hmm  it went through st thomas and back  so everybody from london the a lot of people had cottages down there or even if they didn't they would uh take the train down to port  and it'd let them right out on the beach  and they'd take their picnic hampers up this incline railway  mhh hmm  and uh i'd have a picnic  there was a place called picnic hill  mhh hmm  just lots of picnic tables up there and it looked all over the lake  and uh there was a hotel up there too i think  and uhm then then there was a great big bathhouse for people to change in   mhh hmm   and and the beautiful beach  beautiful lake there   and of course when i was a teenager there there  the train didn't run anymore and uh people still drove down cos the fine wasn't that big for drinking and driving in those  days  okay   but they used to go to the port the stork club and go to dances and then go back to london afterwards  and they could drink and it didn't matter  but then they started cracking down on liquor and  and drinking  and so people didn't want to go down to a dance and have a few drinks and drive back cos they'd get busted so   mhh hmm   it actually when  when i was bout about  twenty-six the burn the storehouse burn stork club burnt down   and almost everything uh great down there did  used to have a huge ferris wheel  the bathhouse burned down  the hotel burned down and and  the stork club burned down   mhh hmm   so but anyway it's still i still take the   k kids you know i still go down there  it's still a beautiful beach   well i'll tell you what they do in chipman for entertainment  what  well they usually uhm drink and race their  cars   laugh   but there is also the chipman drive-in which is watching the bears at the dump  laugh   and people go down with spotlights laugh and watch the bears at the chipman drive-in  laugh lots of fun   jeez i just turned on the c b c canadian broadcasting corporation today that people in killarney park   uh there's uh like a wilderness park near toronto and people go there and try to feed the bears with one hand and take pictures of them with the other  laugh   laugh could you imagine   well if the bears are well fed and don't have little ones then you're okay   i don't know   it's pretty dangerous   yes   they have very long claws   but i can still remember when i was four years old going to the train station in our pink and grey ford  there were four kids and my mother  we would drive to the train station to pick dad up  he had been gone for two weeks usually and he had this huge metal lunch can   and uh we would wait and wait at the train station for him to come in  and my oldest brother would be the only one allowed to get  out of the out of the car to check if the train was coming down the track  laugh   the rest of us had to stay in the car because we wanted to remain dignified laugh   laugh   and uh because i had one younger brother and then two older siblings  and uhm i can remember him running back and telling us that the train was coming and then you would start to hear the whistle and then you would start to see the smoke  and it was so gigantic i it was you know when you're a little child and there's this huge machine coming in  ya   it was just uhm overpowering   but then uh your father   ya i was fascinated with trains too cos they were in my life every day  huge  ya eh  but then your father appeared and all was well  that was a really common thing in st thomas cos most i don don't a lot of my friends  their fathers worked on the railroad which m  meant which meant they didn't see them very much  ya  so it was like essentially it was a a   city with a lot of single moms in it   mhh hmm mhh hmm  you know that had to take care of business while the husbands were away  ya  ya they had to make some big adjustments when the husbands finally came home to stay you know for one reason or another  yes   lost their job or or retired or whatever ya  and dad tells how about how they used to spray alongside the tracks in order for the bushes to die down and how it was poison spray  and now when he thinks back that herbicide  and of course the spray if the wind was blowing right would blow back in your face and   mhh hmm jee  sometimes he would bring us home blueberries that the train had to stop and it just so happened it stopped in a place where there were  blueberries or whatever  mhh   he would pick us some bring them home  ya i reme remember one of my best friends her dad worked on the railroad and he used to go to the states all the time so he's always brought them back stuff  mhh hmm   you know things you couldn't get here  mhh hmm  ahh or you know things that were cheaper there or whatever  mhh hmm  or the tricks they would play on each other uhh as workers  co-workers uhm with the train  like one guy was always asking the other guys for food  he'd want a little piece of whatever they were eating  so one time the guys decided they'd really get him and they  melted some ex-lax onto a donut so it looked like chocolate sauce and they said sure  and he took some  and then they hee-haw about what happened afterward   laugh   did he ha did he ever uh see any accidents with the train  you know unclear word pick up my friend's dad   uh there was a bridge that went down once and we have pictures still of the train that went into the water  it was quite a disaster  but it happened even before i was born  my father was i think twenty years old and he's seventy  now  mhh   and there's pictures of him standing on the   the cars that went into the river  hmm  uh other than that i haven't heard him speak of any accidents  there were uh trestle bridges across all the things  yes   and this is so stupid of us but when we were kids we used to  unclear words across the  tracks laugh   yes we did too   ya   yes  what were we thinking about laugh   risk   ya  breaking the rules  they were the trestle bridges were  across the gulleys  do you use that word  something we that we  say  in st thomas  only   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  cos up here words instead of   but we didn't have too many gulleys  we had deadheads in the river  those are old logs  because they used to float the logs down the river  oh ya   in fact my brother was drowned because of one   that's funny beca  because it's funny how you said c   cos </} because you know that's totally foreign to me   like   deadheads   ya logging or anything like that cos there's nothing around our place like that  ah   and my my roommate my uh classmates   three of them were killed in grade eight because of accidents connected with logs  one down at the mill  a big machine ran over him  one uh she was just walking down the road with her boyfriend and a log truck turned to go down and the logs stick out the back hit her head and she died   ohh gee  ya  and another one it was her sister that died  she was walking on the side of the road and a log truck went by and hit her and she died  hmm   so it's m i don't allow my children  to laugh drive their bikes in cookshire in quebec because of the log trucks that go through there from the states  back and forth   oh ya words   hmm   it's dangerous  one little boy died last two years ago  the trains were a big uh thing in st thomas  like there was uh we knew a boy who was just about my age who had his arm and his leg cut off because he tri   a lot of times the trains would stop and they'd block the road so you couldn't get through and so he tried to climb across   and the and the train shunted  while he was doing it   hmm   uhh   cut off his arm and his leg  and and no he was like an example for the rest of the city  don't you ever go near the track uh the a a train    don't you ever try to go  across the train when it stopped because look at what happened to that boy  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   well there was a boy in lennoxville that just uh  one jumped off the track before the train got there and the other guy did not jump off  and he was in a coma for six months  he's out of the coma now but he has to learn how to talk and he's seventeen years old  jeez  and he can understand what people are saying to him but he cannot form the words to answer back  uh   they had a big uhm chemical scare there eh  they evacuated everybody about  just  the week before we came here i think  yes   yes   but   yes but everyone was calm about it
