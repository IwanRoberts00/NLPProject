 seems to be reaching consensus and   and word a decision  mhh hmm   yes   ya uhm and uhm that's right  there's a also a problem with capitalism  in the north  there's a  problem with capitalism everywhere  laugh   laugh   laugh   laugh it starts at home doesn't it  ya a few words ya  if you make money you stand out   and there there's a tendency there   for for them not to want to be different  oh okay   family connections are much more important than   word   mhh hmm   well you could have the potlatch  when you make money you could give it away to others in the  community   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  mhh  but uh of course that goes a bit against the whole ethos that we have down there   ya  word did it   word   laugh   hmm   that's why i it seems as if the literature that does exist is ext extremely  is dead right that whatever development takes place must be based on existing social structures     mhh hmm   not to superimpose something that's uhh  it's uh seems to be just throwing money away largely  but it doesn't seem as though there's too much prospect of that really happening  uhm well there could be some uhm good business happening if the people who are involved in for example art and crafts if they could start talking to each other and the different communities could trade off send each other their work and then they would have  a a better product line when the few tourists who do show up actually went into the store   well television could help there too actually     mhh hmm mhh hmm   i was just thinking north of sixty canadian television program which i watch religiously a few words    quite active   in fact and then it goes on  yes that's good   mhh hmm ya   agreement   you know i found it quite quite   notable that it wasn't until seventy-one that the the  communities uhh talked to each other uhm ah hadn't  talked much word   but i i gather they weren't really communities until the federal government uh  at least not in the sense that   of of   being villages   exactly   exactly   they were five six families here  the   three or four families over there   hunters and gathers can't afford to live in great bunches of people like that type of thing and that's a ah  absolutely   that's right  mhh hmm  mhh hmm   and and now they have these  these communities in chibougamau is a  population five hundred people and it's one of the most advanced communities in north america     cough   they're total   ya the other word  much too big  yes     uh huh   it's an extraordinary  it has a totally networked computerized uhm system that ties the heating system using wood chips from chibougamau  and uh it's based on a heat transfer system and they've got swedish researchers there in place studying the implementation of this technology  and it's it's highly  advanced     hmm   every single house is networked with every other house  with their uhm heat transfer heating system  it's absolutely fascinating   this community has two telephones   uh uhm   so they can't talk to each other on the community by telephone   uh no i think that the technology is changing and they will have telephones but it's a new community and the system doesn't exist yet   uhm  why not give em them all cellulars laugh   laugh that's right   a few words probably will  word   that'll be useful in the traplines when you're in trouble  word     cough   well are we   i i i don't i i  have read the document in detail from a a  proof-reading standpoint but uhh assuming that somebody has   word   i've gone through it a couple of times  word ya   that's right ya   did you find anything word    word no   responds to a   i went through it once and then two words  word </unclear > was word-checked or spell-checked  go through it     mhh hmm   i didn't notice anything two or three words  no i i went through it very thoroughly again but   yup but i i'm pretty sure  it's it's a word  proofreading comment conversation, directed by z, on the intricacies of the apa style: 2m 15sec   oh ya it may have been offset  that's the older tradition of scholarly uh uhh   partial comment   so it's not it's not it's certainly not   clean a p a american psychological association   well ya  this we can decide   i think maybe what we in this cos this document   uh   agrees   they're only three copies literally  one goes to joan   one goes to robby   and one c comes to me  uh huh   they're kept in the office in the education department  and uh so whatever we decide in this   in this we  have no university ruling on this  agrees   sure   okay okay   ya no i i'm i i   a few words   and if you want to a few words  i'm i think that's fine  no i i think it's quite reasonable  after all it's it's not being   uh   now if this were a thesis and going to the graduate studies then it would have to be  a few words things  mhh hmm   ya mhh hmm   absolutely   word explains reason for question  laugh   yes  no you're right   that word  that that   although it's beginning to get to the point where i think that or it looks like this alm   almost have the status of a thesis  i mean the the the amount of thoughtful writing up and the background i i'm  beginning to wonder whether we really uh  exhale we really need a different world even  a few words mhh hmm   if if uh uhm   well no this probably isn't the place to discuss it but it seems to me an internship the main thing was to was to   do and uh identify crucial situations where you  where you uh learn something unexpected and and  uh situations where you needed to learn things that we hadn't taught you and so on  uh this this internship provides these sorts of things but uhm uhh we do uh we do   require a what seems to be becoming more and more of a thesis document laugh as the time goes on  mhh  that's right   well as you know i work in the university and i   i wanted to to get myself out  of the university right before the word   and that's uh  that's why i chose the option b  yes   ya   uh it was a it was a great uh way it worked out with word   do you have the sheets for us to sign  yes  i think we can uhm  we'll let you have a formal decision  and uh i would like to ask everyone to   leave   mhh hmm   i wonder if tape cuts out   hi diane   hi   isn't it a pleasure to have some decent weather  oh yes ya  i'm dressing like too warm waiting for this kind of weather   i never know what to put on   it's all right   part way through the day it can get really cold and it snowed yesterday laugh   and it could snow i guess  exactly exactly   anyway uh uh i'm glad we could get together because i  i've got picked up my comps yesterday so i'm i'm wanting to get something really new nailed down specifically what i need to do to finish  this paper  okay okay   all right i uhm am sorry to have delayed so much you know   n no  i didn't i didn't pursue you either   laugh   ya it wouldn't have done any good anyway  oh okay laugh   laugh so no guilt trips here   that's clear ya   but i uhm i  laugh read it twice  once when i got it and and again   over last night  okay   you've got some very interesting stuff here and some  ideas that seem to come out  or let's say i was trying to see you come out  of this and uh it seems to me that in several instances i could   mhh hmm mhh hmm   oh that's   one of them you really are   seem to be taken with the idea of language uhm as being  exhale   let's say you're you're you're quizzing whether language is an essential part of cultural identity and you've found a number of references to that  so uh is is that true  ya ya that's uhm well that's partly  ca came it came out   of that article  and i i guess i i'm  thinking you know if a if a community keeps its language they probably keep their culture somewhat more distinct  even though people say language is not an essential component of culture it seems like a really powerful marker or something that  is is strong a stronger marker than  i think only one person said this a stronger marker than a dance or a dress or other distinctive things that make up   a cul culture   distinctive features of a culture   ya   mhh hmm   inhale   so and that that is what i'm i'm thinking of exploring  about five words   and when i read through some of these papers   i don't i don't see that really developed  ya   maybe i haven't found the right book or paper yet  i haven't seen that idea developed really in a balanced way with language and ethnic identity  ya   like how does how much does a person attach themselves to a culture  how much does that how strong is that bond or relationship   between identity and language  ya   mhh hmm mhh hmm   i don't see that really coming  and i don't know those papers  and and that's  i don't know  maybe i need to read baker again  i've been rereading a couple of  chapters so  ya   okay   but you uhm you  did point out some methodo methodological   problems  in some of those papers that said that there was not a strong link between language and  cultural identity   but that's   mhh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   so i think that's something worth pursuing  mhh  the uhm you you   didn't go into the fishman though which we had talked  about  no   no i didn't  and uhm   what what do you recommend i read to go into that more  is there anything in particular that would  cos i i did check for some books in the library  of fishman's books   ya ya  i have been looking through them  and i just i don't know if  ah it just didn't seem like uh  i found books with the titles that seemed appropriate and yet   i i kinda kind of just didn't   i don't know why i didn't laugh go into fishman but  well uhm i can't say that there's any one  publication uhh that i can think of that would summarize his thought  although certainly that excerpt in baker   okay   uhh why don't you  you had a photocopy of that as i recall   ya ya  and the book's out till until   may or something  well you can borrow mine if you'd like   you word   would that be all right  yes of course   i i'd really like  that because i i i've got enough   isn't it right there   ya i saw it laugh   is it uh this one or this one  ya that one   i don't know but i think it's that one  i think this is the one i have photocopies from  that the part where it's thinking you're thinking of is  decline of languages  word uhm on founded   it was on particularly  well you might even find something else there but i'd think you'd find that it was in uhm   okay not classroom prac   oh wait   you got me in the wrong book   oh this isn't the right book   okay  you're quite right  it must be the other one  oops   here we go   no no   there's something like  it is that other one  ya  do take that too in case there's something but let me look through here because i know  this i used it   okay   language revival and re and reversal    okay it's on page fifty on  here he talks uhh  fishman  lookit canadian interjection demanding attention  they use his nineteen ninety-one book which i'd have to at the back see what it was   a language indexes its culture  a language symbolizes its culture  culture is partly created from its language   which when you think about it makes an awful lot of sense  ya   where do the songs come from   literature   where does the literature come from the stories  the myths  ya   and uhm so there's there's that little bit  and then he talks about it's this graded intergenerational disruption scale about how the whole thing can collapse and uh for threatened languages  mhh hmm   but if you pull out from that if you're not just looking at threatened languages but you look at   in this he he actually goes into detail on the importance of language
