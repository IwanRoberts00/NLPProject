 but they may have ideas  they may have ideas  so you write them all down and if they want to fill out something that can if they have any ideas at this point  okay   coughing fit   that'd be great   okay so i'm gonna going to   bring all this up monday morning   ya   okay   the word banking security pamphlet then b c manual then the meeting then the recognition party  then the tr   you see the b c manual has never been done in french   word jenny was working on it  blackmon-manning   ya  i know at one point she said she uh she   would  i didn't i didn't remember she was still doing it  well i'm glad  cos it's all there  the translations are all there  you just have to get it in the right font and the right pages  cough they've got it in italian eh cough   it's in italian  ya  who's doing it in italian   it's on the computer   rona did  rona did the block captain manual  did s she   oh no  soren okay   no soren's   ya  sorry   uh the block parent committee the block captain training and maintenance the bulletin the two words   animation c&circumflex;te de word ensemble  child identification sessions  we're gonna going to have to go over these one more time   that's what we'll do monday cos i'm sure there's stuff missing  well we should take the list that i made at the beginning of the year and compare it with that  yup i have that   uhm i'm sure we're gonna going to   come up with things that we hadn't thought of   yup   that's right  liquid paper's getting thick   okay  so you like that idea  yup  it gives everyone a chance to prepare because i don't wanna want to go there i don't  wanna want to spend the last two weeks  not knowing what to talk about  ya  you have to prepare  ya  okay so something like this  this liquid paper is finished  there's more in the other   i mean it's very liquid but the brush is  disgusting  sniff   because we really have to plan priorities for next winter  i wanna want to do something  i would like to do something big next year maybe during national crime prevention week which will be in june  ya but whatever happened to the mega- project    mm hmm   this is true  but uh if camden's future's on the line   it's ah up to us to prove uh   i know   what we can do  ya  we know what we're doing   so anyway   uhm jorge called s uh gerald  and asked why we're not doing more for national crime prevention week   what did he say  i don't know what he said but i i  gave gerald an earful  i said the whole year's been like a national crime prevention year  i said give us a break  he agreed   we were talking about jorge's politics and   i'm getting tired of you know  ya   i know   like the comit&eacute; des gens   but uh sniff i guess we'll see from there  well go f on   exhale so what else to you ha  have   okay   didn't you say uh didn't like jorge  say at the beginning of the year don't put too much emphasis  on on national crime prevention week this year cos it's gonna going to change  i thought similar   i don't know what his problem is  so it's in june and we'll have to   well in december we'll figure out what we want to do  is it gonna going to to be all geared towards youth   you heard raj on sunday   i i   i heard him  i know amelie's really big on that and yes but that doesn't help the people who are living now   eventually yes in the future if you give kids what they need they'll be okay but that doesn't help our senior population  the thing is with kids uh i mean it's not uhm a one time thing  no  it's not like when we do information sessions with  uh with adults where if you explain something to them and they pretty much get the drift  mm hmm  with kids you have to repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat  look at mary-beth anderson's school  if i went back half of them wouldn't remember what i said  ya  you know  and it's more than that too  it's not just someone talking to them  it's making sure they're fed properly in the morning so they can go to school and learn instead of being hungry  and you know dropping out of school cos they're not concentrating so they don't do well   ya   ya but what they're talking about youth things they're not just talking about sessions  they're talking about plays and  ya  sigh   well it looks nice very nice  thanks   so   i mean we could do it but it's an awful lot of energy  why don't we get uhm stagiaires   or something students to do it  students   if we got a student uhm grant for the summer   or even one of those uhh projects that we had where we had the  darius and uh  and have them work strictly on working out a play  mm hmm   mm hmm   like anne-marie did  ya because we  look at us  we we don't have the time   unless we drop everything we're doing  nope   ya  and people this community won't let us  nope   could you imagine if they were talk  talking   you know who would be our biggest supporter if there was even a movement to get rid of camden would be john   you think so   karen can't say anything now can she  she wouldn't have been able to say anything then  she was with she was with  the n t n   the opposition   ya  john's opposition  ya  front page of the monitor he said he was gonna   going to   no not front page but in the monitor this week did you see what it said  no i haven't read it  i'll get it speaker gets up and moves away; rustling sound   uhh page two  quotation   which is true  ya   so   but you know how much political stirring that would  even saint declan's and easthaven the letters they could write and   i know   edison and all that stuff  i'm i'm not worried  all our block captains   mm hmm  and their members  mm mm mm yup   okay let's talk about this block captain meeting in december  which is only like three weeks away   i know  next week i have to do my mailing  is it the next week or the week after that i put it down  i put it down for the twenty-first   it's like   okay   uhm that's only two weeks before   it's just that i couldn't   if i can i'll do it next week  but will they forget though  well that's what i'm i'm worried about  two weeks   giving them two weeks is  but it's also a potluck so they have to call anna   ya   so anna's looking after this  anna's looking after this  uhm i have the thing that she gave me uhm that about what she what she needs and all that and her  phone number is  on it   oh she word   okay   so i'm not doing any of it  okay  this is her idea  this is what she wants to do  uhm so i'm not getting involved in it  do we need uh  i guess we need supplies  ya what we'll need is plates forks knives   and with someone like let's say alain  who maybe you know doesn't cook doesn't wanna want to   cook maybe he can bring fifty plates  ya   but we have plastic plates downstairs  ya   i liked it with   i did the same thing for w   for saint declan's   i have to get  i mean i mean i'm gonna   going to get all the forks and plates and stuff like that  for them  what about christmas and chanukah napkins  i think we should take out our little christmas tree put it right in the middle of the table  yup  because we have more uh  our jewish uh block captains are growing  yup  ivan goldenberg   ya  and it's nice to you know   i don't know if we have any muslim   uh well we have uh nur al din mu   muslim or not   yes i believe he's muslim   are we inviting those people   are we inviting saint declan's and  easthaven   no   no  block captains only  block captains  i know at saint declan's we're having our own  ya  i don't know what easthaven's doing but   ya   okay so anna's handling all of this   ya   so we're basically just gonna going to  plan a regular meeting except shorter  yup   yup  and then it's uhh   what night is it  it's on a wednesday the seventh  whistling   december   aw shh  two words two thousand   okay so december seventh wednesday   i think you're invited to ours on uhm the day before   if you want   oh ya   ya  in east to uh saint declan's    i keep saying easthaven   is it a potluck again   ya  everybody's going to bring something  okay   uhm but anna's going to call me and see  cos i told her i said i'll bring whatever's needed at the end you know  ya   and it's a gift exchange  but you buy a gift five dollars male or female no name on it   but whoever shows up has to bring a gift  okay  so michael got into it  oh michael god  michael   oh i'll make this  i'll make that  okay i'm making the cake  okay i'll i'll i know i have to make my mousse too  word   and people find he's so  when you first meet him he's very you know   cold  ya  ya  he looks it  ya  but he's not   he sounds it too  oh no no  not at all  cos he's a big pussycat   he's ser he's serious   in his job  oh ya  that's the thing you know and we need that   oh uh i mean look if you had someone like marjorie  sitting on saint declan's   oh god  laugh   i mean he he commands that type he commands that type of attention  word think about it   yup  but he is a big pussycat   he scared me the first time i met him  laugh   i said no   cos i was going from working with women which are   which is really different you know  ya  and i met him i thought oh no   dana i think said oh he's kinda kind of  cute  laugh   well and look what happened  okay so i'll make something too  can you tell me  okay so for the block captain then just to call anna  tell her what i will be making  yup  i'm going to look through my cookbooks this weekend   i'm learning how to plan ahead   another one of my problems   exhale okay so call anna for  i learnt that in high school  we had no choice   we had to make our own agenda  sniff   there was a deadline to put in certain reports but there was different steps to give in   and we had to make our own agenda say when we were giving it in  if we didn't we lost points  hm   my stomach's rumbling  hungry  no not especially  i am  i didn't have breakfast  okay so what else here now   i'm just looking at your stuff sniff   oh you have a black you have an animator's meeting   yes  and did i fill in  i have to leave from twelve to two so i'm gonna  going to bring my own car to the thing  okay  two words reason i'm probably going to leave from home and go directly there  it's just as uh quick for me  uhm   i was supposed to do the lawn circle  okay   three words   you've got a few words eh   word   ya i know  why are we the front uh on the front line   again   i don't know  cos we're the only office that knows how to do this thing   we're the only office that camden didn't do it   because it seems that when the city did it there were all these problems   and the city didn't do it  we did it   and like amelie said meagan spitzer's been one of our biggest supporters  she loved the way it was done   you know as opposed to the city where jean michelle  she liked the way   shaka too though  she's no longer there  ya  shaka   because shaka told uh uhm i think it was  jorge said well i'm using the n d g notre-dame-de-gr&acircumflex;ce
