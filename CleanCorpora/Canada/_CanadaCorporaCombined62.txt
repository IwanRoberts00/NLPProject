 you know it w was   it's just not the same   i don't blame him   i think it was very nice of him to take her in the first place  oh ya i think so too   freddy wouldn't want to take my mother  no no  well i mean we had never done ths before and i thought well you know we could try and see what it would be like   well yes you tried   you know and why why  couldn't   i brought you a cookie   oh thank you  and you think why can't everybody enjoy themselves but somehow you know the good dynamic is not  there somehow   it it doesn't   that that must be it   somehow   it doesn't work  oh by the way talking about going  guess where i'm going this weekend  where  you'll never guess so i'll have to tell you  ya  reno  you're kidding  wow  with with freddy   the two of you   his brother his brother's  son my nephew  is getting married  uh huh   ya   now he moved to san fransisco  he went to law school in san fransisco  uh huh   you know he couldn't get into any other law school except that one  is that right  mhh hmm  wow it pretty nice law school  san fransisco's a gorgeous city huh   ya   hmm  but nevertheless that's why he ended up in san fransisco  right  and he met this girl and a year ago  they decided to get married  mhh hmm   in reno  well her parents  she's from reno  oh she's from reno   you know i guess   from reno  i guess they were there  isn't that amazing  so freddy said i think we should go to the wedding  i said what  are you nuts  we're going for the weekend  it's gonna going to to cost us a  fortune  mhh   i said i don't think it's laugh such a good idea   but he says he only had one brother  mhh hmm  da da da da da  think   oh well why not   so if you wanna want to  give me a dollar to put in the slot machine for you  everyone says will you word   now's the time   but   put my name on it  but  right  laugh   but don't give it to me cos i'll   i already lost a dollar today  i bet with freddy this morning that o j simpson would be found guilty   i haven't heard yet  he's innocent  they found him innocent   they they acquitted him   they acquitted him  and freddy said no he's gonna going to  be innocent  i said no way  i bet a dollar  i already lost a dollar  uh laugh   uh huh  he's innocent  so he's being let go then  absolutely  i didn't hear the radio conversation references taping, 5 seconds   i didn't hear the radio but when i was at school   someone came into my classroom guess what innocent on both counts or whatever  mhh hmm   whatever that means  i don't know what the counts were   well i guess because he he  supposedly killed two people   mhh   wow  you know a lot of people thought he was innocent  that's what i kept hearing  i was surprised   my my friends thought he was guilty  but my students i was speaking to them today   thought i don't think he's they don't think he's guilty   ya   mhh hmm   and i had one student said i mean maybe   maybe he's a little guilty  how could you be a little guilty  ya   well he made a mistake  i said it's not a mistake   what kind of mistake   people just don't s they don't get it  no   they don't get it  they think he's less guilty because ah of who he is  mhh hmm   i think that's a kind of a mentality thing  ya because he's a big s star   hero and star and  boggles the mind  but i was thinking that he was guilty because   of uh   you know of things that he was doing before  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  the things they said  > that he had been abusive and he'd been stalking his  ex-wife afterwards and  mhh hmm   i think he's guilty   well that that  made me feel that he was guilty  yup  and then also the way he reacted when the police chased him  remember when he  was in his bronco  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i mean if if he wasn't guilty why would he be taking off like that  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and it seemed like there was blood everywhere   mhh hmm   even at his house   you know it's like   word cough   and and if he didn't kill her then who did  ya and what's the motive  what's the motive  i mean it's amazing  mhh hmm   it's just like uhm there was this article in time magazine not that long ago and saying how anybody who is not rich and  famous you know they would be locked up like nothing  famous   mhh hmm   ages ago  and the money   you know that's really what determines whether you're going to be found guilty or innocent and it just proves it   ya and this is a definite case that just proves it   just proves it  mhh hmm   wow  hmm  isn't that something  ya  and that i had a   stu student another student  that we were talking about it today who said you know they read all these books all these trashy books  and she said that uhm i didn't know about it nicole simpson or whatever   was had a friend who was into drugs and uhm them it's the mafia that probably killed her   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   i never heard of that  so they got it all figured out  huh  and and goldman just happened to be there  oh ya  there's a new tactic for you  well that's ya  well  i don't know  neither  meanwhile i think that 's terrible  oh it is  mhh  it's amazing  hmm  he's going to be laughing all the way to the bank  ya i with this  this book that he brought out  did he  i didn't know word   yes there's a book he wrote while he's  been in prison  wow   well there you go  it's called something like i want to tell you  oh really  uh huh  i was waiting for something to come out  maybe three words   and i heard something else on t v the other day  what was it   that he has all of this stuff just ready uh to sell  uh for after his acquittal  mhh hmm   really  ya you know like t-shirts and you know all sorts of little knick-knacky kinda kind of things that people will buy and collect and  even though it cost him all this money for the lawyers i mean  mhh hmm   well he'll make it all back again   interviews on t v afterwards  uh for sure   mhh hmm  well it doesn't pay to be good  laugh   there you go laugh   there you go there you go   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  mhh i don't know  so what else is new mary   what else are have you been doing  what else is new  let's see   but it keeps you pretty busy doing all this  school stuff eh   uhm   well ya school has been really really busy  i haven't been doing much else out  i find   actually i'm hoping that this weekend   will will be a free weekend just to do  something different   ya i heard   in between projects and stuff   ya  no i find when you have a words  sometimes you take many more courses than i do   ya  you know so if it's not one course that has something it's another  right  and they give you so many things that  i find it really takes up all of your time  mhh hmm >  > oh it does   definitely   uhm ya   but this this year  i i don't know  uhm i'm finding it it's so different than last year  mhh hmm  like last year it was just so much in in   in the way of uhm individual work  you know lots of studying lots of papers and individual  projects   okay   ya   but now it's just sort of changed  it's all of this group stuff  and i i i like working in groups if you don't have to  meet  ya  if you don't have to be meeting so much and you know uhm  mhh hmm   if you have to do a group report i find that really difficult because uhm  i don't know why they they   i mean it's it's a good idea   ya   you know it's got its point but it really is hard to organize everyone   but it's not like the  that that you have a uhm computer desk  somewhere on the university where you can all  you know cram in there and you know  work on it or you know something like this  mhh hmm mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh   i mean everybody has to take their stuff home  type up their stuff  bring it back  mhh  and then you know you have to sit there and haggle it out  i see  which takes a lot of time because people don't agree  you know   it's a waste of time   mhh hmm   one person wants to do it this way  one person wants to do it that way   so this i find really quite difficult   the uhm  i wonder what you learn from that  you know you're supposed to  that's   ya i think they want us to learn how to collaborate and negotiate things  i hope that's what they'd like you to learn  but i'm i'm finding you know   it's i don't know it's just so rushed  you know you have like about a week to prepare something  together in a group  mhh hmm   i mean you can't possibly do   most of the time you're worrying about the logistics  that's right  that's right  which is a waste of time  ya  ya  i mean you can't all the time just spend working on the thing  that's right  have you heard anything about that computer head  course we're taking next term  no no   i'm just curious   but i'm looking forward to it  i hope that it will be something really practical without group work laugh   i don't know what  i hope it  no i don't i have no idea what it's about   ya   but uh no i haven't heard anything about it  no  but oh i know what i should tell you  we went to uhm one of these vineyards out in the eastern townships a few weeks ago  ahh   really   and that's actually what i would like to do again this weekend  i'd like to go out there  especially if it's nice  uhm this vineyard it's called uhm le cep d'argent  and they make uhm different kinds of not only wine  but  also uhm   mhh hmm   cough   uh what do you call them like ah aparro  nonsense word   uh what do you call uh  a cider  no  uhm you know like a cinzano or port or something  what's that  you know like when you have a drink before dinner  aperitif  aperitif ya  and uhm also champagne  cough   and uhm   so they give you a tour  they give you a tour   and so just like they give you in   in california and france   that's right   i didn't know that they had a w   winery a winery   here   and and   ya ya ya  they have a few of them out there  and there quite new though  oh okay   uh mostly french people who have come over here  and uhh clicked with some quebec people and then started that   i either it's not very well  known or i just never heard of it  it's quite new  it's quite new  ya   must be  they're they're quite new  there're there're probably about seven of them out there and   cough   seven is a lot  they they're they've probably just  started up in about the last five or ten years you know  have another cookie   so they're quite quite new  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so we went to this one and uhm they took us out into the fields and showed us the grapes and told us you know like all about the climatic conditions and all that kind of stuff  mhh hmm
