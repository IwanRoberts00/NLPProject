 uhm in the interview you can expect up to three  between three and six people interviewing you okay   ah they usually have a pretty even base of men to women okay   uhm usually they have uh the department head or the department coordinator of the english department a couple of teachers and some administrative people either the head of the director of human resources or director of uh the conseil two or three words  or something  anyways they have some sort of administrative people  i never know who they are  uhm the uh the interview is bilingual completely so if you're worried about your french uh you have reason to worry about your french audience laughs nervously   uh is everybody are you all  bilingual audience responds   okay okay inaudible audience comment   pardon me  responds   yeah well i have a really big accent and my french is not perfect uhm   i lost jobs because of my french audience mumbles   you know i've i've lost at least two because of my french  not lost but i i know i didn't get them because of my french  so ah if your french is weaker i'd i  really really suggest taking some sort of french course okay  or going out and getting a french girlfriend or boyfriend  audience laughs   my girlfriend's my my girlfriend's  french now and it's multiple audience members comment   well there you know you can go get a  a separatist or something one or two words  you'll be completely okay audience laughs   so french is really really important  when you get into the interview unfortunately uhm  what they often do is ah you have to write a test audience members overlap with laughing and questions for a few seconds - - conversation and a's speech unclear   you have to write a test  it never ends audience members continued laughter until now   uh ya you have to write a grammar test   audience member makes a comment   no it's no it's english uh it's english  a few words   audience member makes a comment   oh i'll talk about that in a minute   yeah i'll talk about that in a little while   audience member makes a comment   because you do have to do word   but in the actual interview there are usually two  two types of tests that you have to teach  ah to to take okay  the first is usually some sort of grammar test  grammar correction often what they do is give you uh a sample essay from a student and they ask you to correct it okay  as you correct it they don't give you any guidelines you just correct it   or ah another cegep i went to i got a multiple choice fill in the blanks the three words type of thing   it's sounds funny some of them are complicated   the last one i got was uhm uhm   the last job at rene-belanger i did one grammar test   it was i i was very upset at this time because i didn't get a lot of time to write this test in which is one or two words so i did the grammar test very very badly  and it was pretty hard grammar test and i didn't know the rules on a lot of the uh  i m my grammar if you're strong str  you if you're really strong in grammar then you shouldn't have a problem but i'm not   my strength is not grammar   and i missed a lot of them okay  but they they weren't uhm they weren't   typical french cana french canadian   some of these mistakes are mistakes that uhm uhm uh native speakers make  uh i'll give you an example neither he nor i  okay neither he nor i and then they have the verb to be it should be is  or are or am sorry  uh and this is t the type of mistake which is   i was not familiar with the rule and had to go and look it up and i can see some of you going i i are neither him nor i are  or whatever   anyways the whole point is i had to go and look it up afterwards but uhm   so you do have to do some sort of grammar test  i wish i'd brought  i probably have it somewhere if i have it i'd show it to you  but if i don't well i can't audience laugh   uhm   anyways the point is that it's a uh there is  a grammar test  the second thing you have to do is write some sort of essay  okay  the essay is uh usually something like what does it mean to be a cegep teacher or why do you want to teach in cegep audience react  this is a warning too often they ask you this in french or in english so you might have to write a french composition also  okay someone laughs   comments   to be an english teacher two or three words  it's even worse  i'll talk about other things later  asks a question   doesn't matter  comments   okay ah so you have to do grammar okay so yeah  french ability is important  your and the english  grammar test   your the third thing and probably   sigh something i'm gonna going to  mention that seems so obvious but they tell me uh the  interviewers one of the reasons why i got the job   appearance is so important audience react   uhm don't i wouldn't overdress   b uh be you but don't be i mean i mean  i wouldn't wear a tuxedo laugh starts or anything like that laugh ends   ah but at the same time i went to all kinds of interviews with jeans   what i look like now i went to some of my interviews in  most of the time i wear a nice pair of pants and  and just a ah n a nice shirt  appearance is so important  people are so influenced with appearance  and we at that level because they're not looking at you as a   three or four words they're looking at you standing in front of a class and how are these students gonna  going to react to you audience member coughs     and that's really really important  so uhm be really appearance you know it's really important  uh i got so many jobs and so many people told me well  you got the job cos you're clean   and you know and then you start taking people  word interviews but apparently there are t people who don't you know  they     mumbled word   cleaning your nails a simple thing like that can can you can when you've finished eating   so   ah okay the other thing that's so important and you can't change this you can't you can't there's nothing you can do about it but personality   and that's how i got most of my jobs was based on my personality  who how i acted and stuff   uhm the interviews are hard they usually try to make them hard  they they don't usually laugh and they sit and stare at you and   make you feel very uncomfortable  just go in there and kinda kind of smile and even if they're ripping you apart just go word   that's really hah  yes i am very stupid audience laughter   but uh   yeah i'm well   audience member comments   i i i really  it sounds funny but just keep smiling  don't don't get into a conflict situation with them where it's  they like they would like to  turn get you into a conflict situation sometimes   audience member comments   to see how you react and if you react negatively you can just kiss that job goodbye  so you really really you know   either avoid the conflict altogether okay some   some teachers like or just avoid it in very interesting ways   and uh or you know deal with it very very professionally  okay  uhm the other thing they might ask  okay and the last thing about being hired might be uh sex is important  not in terms of having sex but in terms of ah your sex audience members laugh and comment   ah i've been told recently i'm where  i am now there's two teachers myself and another teacher who ah are the last ones in on the the thing  and if everything else is egual equal   she will get the job cos it's a woman okay  so men are at a slight disadvantage  if they have a quota to meet or something it's a hiring of  two teachers and the first one who is already hired and they're  one or two words quota for women or men uhm you could lose the job kay okay so  it usually doesn't affect you  they usually know that ahead of time  but if it comes down t to   y between you and a woman w i mean providing you're not a woman uhm if it's a man and a woman they often choose the woman okay  so that's that is a slight disadvantage  and the unfortunate thing it's a cegep-wide policy which uh i usually agree with cos there's not many female cegep teachers  unfortunately in the language department it's often quite  quite ah there's quite a few women  so it's it should be by department but they do it by cegep  so it's a bonus for women and it's a little bit of a drawback for men   anyways  ah okay clears throat uhm i was going to mention something oh okay no i'll get to that later   contracts   the type of contract you can get   uhm you can get uh sounds of writing on board with chalk  part-time  this chalk i it's like the stuff they give you in uh elementary school for the kids to play with  sounds of writing on board with chalk three or four words  audience mumble and comment   okay uh audience continue mumbling and laughter   part-time and full-time  so there's two kind of contracts there's part-time  full-time  ah full-time is uhm full-time is uh  sounds of writing on board with chalk five courses  okay  and part-time obviously is anything uh less   i'll talk about the everything  else later  asks a question   per term   yeah on   start comic voice if you save your questions to the end i'll answer word end comic voice audience laughter   yeah ah yeah it's it's five per term audience laughter continues   i always wanted to do that  uh a university professor answer audience laughter continues   okay ah the first one is uh it's you can  get it by session okay  which is what i had which is a replacement contract but you can get ah a position which is not a replacement contract  but so you get it by session okay   the second one obviously is by year sounds of writing on board with chalk okay  now if it's uh i i'd rather not talk about the part-time contract  i know this kinda kind of looks bad  but there's probably not that many contracts s'all  it's all full-time okay  the se the session you can work thirty years in a cegep by session getting session contracts   uhm it really is the pits because you'll never get uh you'll never get a sabbatical or uh  your pay raises you're part of the union but you don't get the the  y you never get permanent status kay  okay   about a year is what they call sounds of writing on board with chalk uh word okay which  one or two words post okay  the post you need ah uh you need three posts  sounds of writing on board with chalk to get permanent  sounds of writing on board with chalk   permanent with an e or an a  clarifies   a multiple members correct   e word   as you can tell i'm not a speller audience mumble   i got a really good computer this year with a spellcheck   a few words audience laugh     comments   weak laugh   okay so uh the post is by year   you need three posts in the same cenete  the same cegep to get p uh uh permanent  okay  if you ever get offered a post just take it   it's so hard to get okay  at this point in time they're really hard to get  i'm trying to get a post and it's really really hard okay  three posts you become permanent  the day you become permanent is the day you start dreaming about your sabbatical okay  i think it takes about seven years okay  but if you get this by session you never get a sabbatical   you can work years and years and years and years and never get a sabbatical okay  that's the biggie  that's the big difference between a post and a permanent position  als uh this by sorry by session  also by session you don't know if you're  gonna going to work the next session audience agrees  which is a real pain   because now it's good i have money i'm working it's great and then uh come may i'll be like panicking cos i won't have a job okay  so i gotta got to go out there again and search for it   you get a post it's quite nice there's a good chance you'll get another post okay  these are almost   this these are really good   so if you get a post there's a very very good chance you would  be uhm get another one   audience member asks a question   audience member continues   they don't do that   they w it's a union contract  okay   but some uh some cegeps if they're not sure   if they're sure they'll give you a post   if they're not sure they'll give you contracts  sentence other student uh populations okay  &  audience members comment   what they did uhm my last cegep one teacher was teaching fourteen years by contract okay  and only uh two years ago they gave him a post so   usually i think the rule is that if they have   some cegeps work like this  if they have two people okay and the person like  uhm they're always needing two people the first person will get the post  they'll create a position   and the last person will be th the   sessional person okay  usually that works but not always  it depends on the cegep  depends what kind of cegep that we have   administration in cegep is the pits okay uh  and there is no third one  yeah no no there is no third one okay  so you really want to get a post okay   the uh i brought uh i started making   overheads but i didn't have time so i'm gonna going to  put this on the board   and this is probably everything   but you've all taken education in quebec audience responds  okay no so you've seen the pay scale audience responds  okay right you word okay  anyways i'm just gonnu going to uhm
