 and then it's a myth that you know that uh  canada has this whole right to self-determination  that's why quebec is uh saying   it's a myth that canada has a right to self-determination  well i i believe so because the parliament gives up daily secrets to the governor general and his position is to report to the queen the findings to the queen    and then the queen exercises her uh prerogative powers on canada     sir   so the way i feel this i feel that this helps explain why there's not a dime's worth difference between being a british   a british colony or what we are now repatriated constitution  alan  yes am i wrong  yes  tell me where  alan the queen has no say in what we do  nothing whatsoever  she's a figurehead in britain let alone here  here she doesn't get to be the figurehead very often  uh the queen doesn't get the secrets of the canadian government whispered into her ear  the queen doesn't hear from the governor general of canada very often unless it's a request that she uh visit moose jaw in nineteen ninety-eight  uh believe me uh the queen doesn't have influence  at least canada is sovereign  quebec maybe isn't but canada is  honest  well if canada is sovereign why can't canada  or canada should take say here are my cards i'm laying them on the table   and lay em them to the voters because   george when you have a a voter who votes he's or her sh they  are the people that vote and get government in power and no government can can say say or or say and do anything that they want to say or do when it comes election-time until a voter says yes or no  and go after the voter  give the voter something  but the voters have said some things here in quebec sir  commercials and traffic report   okay back to the telephone on feedback with george fraser word   we're talking specifically about daniel johnson but generally about the situation over the last few days  sorry i don't have any lines here but i i'll  give you the number so when we do clear out a line you can get through  seven nine two three four five one and star eight two five four news   we go to the star line and bob   hello bob   hello bob   hi it's bobby   bobby   i'm an angry-phone play on " anglophone" and i'd like to make a comment on mister cot&eacute;   yeah   i mean it's becoming patently obvious that this so called neutrality here uh whether there's a conspiracy i don't know and i'm not qualified to know but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to start figuring out that there was shall we say some collusion along the line here  i mean they you know they basically took out a hundred thousand votes or who knows exactly and it appears kind of strange to me where they're going to take criminal actions i think the  the these egos are incredible against individuals who are were showing solidarity vis &agrave; vis trying to keep canada together  should daniel johnson be raising hell about that or should he be  i think daniel johnson is a total hypocrite and the problem is if you're an angry-phone here who do you have to vote for  i think he's a closet separatist  i think well i don't know i may we i'll  take that back  i just think he's not showing a lot of fortitude in coming forth and stating his real position is as a   supposedly as a federalist  but what really gets to me and a lot of people around uh is  this this attitude that the separatists have that they on their own can determine what they want to do and it's international law and the canadian constitution's irrelevant and what three and a half million quebecers feel is irrelevant and i think it's about time well we'll see  they they appeared to have stepped up to the plate on this bertrand case but the reality of it is that the rest of the country would be highly effected economically and in other ways as well by a unilateral declaration of independence  and if we had a real government in ottawa they would take these people to task and basically stipulate that uh uh a referendum is  is politically uhm yeah well and it's economically and politically destabilizing for all canadians   and as would be unilateral declaration of independence  far as i'm concerned the current word  government is a rogue government and if they keep it up in any normal country they'd no " be" put put in jail for treason  i'd like to hear laugh your comments on that  laugh well i think we're a long way from treason but i appreciate your call bob   thanks for calling here  and i just uh will i'm sure he's listening in his car i  will say again i i am in a position to know  personally daniel johnson better than i've ever known any other premier  now in our business we do get to meet all of them at one time or another but uh daniel johnson is uh eh is a committed federalist  there's no question about that  you can question how he goes about being a a  committed federalist and that's fair game  but he is that  i assure you  i i've as a matter of fact uh a few weeks ago before the johnsons went on a tour of the west i had uh lunch with missus daniel johnson susan marseille who i also uh know and uhm she was i mean she's   she's like a crusader for canada  she's so passionate about canada  and the reason we were lunching together is they had some appointments uh to be on some talkshows out west and she wanted my opinion about who ah wou would be amenable to uhh to letting them get the message accross and who might not and so on  uhm if i may talk about the couple they are they are very much federalist greatly federalist  uh doesn't mean that they do everything right and doesn't mean that he does everything right but that much you shouldn't doubt   okay let's see what jared has to say  hello jared   hello   hi  extra corpus commentary   okay sir  i think you're a little uhm cynical about politicians  i don't hold it against them that they want to be elected  you can't do what you want to do without being elected  uh but i think most politicians and it doesn't matter what stripe  are into it because there are certain things they believe in and they want to accomplish them  however you notice i didn't interrupt  i let him give his whole speech there  hello raymond   yes hello  uh i could react to your uh previous caller this bobby  character and his absurdities but i i won't waste my breath but i would like to submit this to you sir concerning  the uh the march uh uh in october preceding the referendum and the report that came out i would i would ask you are are the laws that were made up in quebec concerning referendum are these valid to you  if you are telling me   are these legal  are are would you listen now  you've asked a question  if you're telling me that i can't go to a rally without charging the money to the no side or the yes side let me tell you cos i'm assuming now that you're a separatist  yes i am  let me tell you that the most stinking dirty filthy  trick of the whole referendum campaign was using the people's money the people's money through the caisse de deaigupocircumflext quebec co-operative bank to prop up the canadian dollar to give the lie that the canadian dollar wasn't being affected by the referendum  you're not   you're not answering my question  so if   so if i'm answering your question  no you're not answering my question  your baloney question   you're you're a passionfruit   i am answering you're question  you are an idiot  sorry about that  i'm not supposed to get mad  and so ladies and gentlemen smiling he said let us go to the next caller  but let me finish what i said  if i've gotta got to charge up my i went by subway to that ah gathering if i  gotta got to charge up my token to the no committee there's something wrong with the referendum law  it stinks  and that's basically what they're talking about  you know somebody flies in from vancouver and today we've got a little bit less of a price and so that's cheating that's lying  that's crap  that's what that is  and the caisse de deaigupocircumflext  spending hundreds of millions of your dollars to buy canadian dollars so that the obvious won't be there that the canadian dollar is being affected by the referendum that was cheating  that was money cheating  and that was the yes side  and they didn't investigate that one did they  and it was your dough  hello steven   hi how are you  well i'm just fine  i'm in a very good mood  word so am i  ya laugh   you know what i got a solution to this whole problem  you remember in seventy when they sent in the tanks well they should sent in the airforce the army and the navy to scare these guys because you can't talk to these guys  these separatists you can't talk to them  they only understand what not " when" the   the c f eighteens are flying over that's when they understand  that's the answer  okay sir  i don't agree but uhm some people would agree with you probably  i don't think there's much doubt about that  there's some people who think this thing oughta  ought to come down laugh to warfare eventually  uh i'm not of that ilk  hello melissa   hi  i find this whole thing pretty scary  i want to ask your opinion  uhm how what would it take to get a complete recount of the last referendum  i uh think that we're beyond the the  point where uh it could uh be done  and even if it were done uh uh so what  well   the the declaration would be that the no side won but we already have that declaration   no but the point being that we're supposed to be a democracy  and the thing that we cherish the most is going out and voting for the government that we want  no i quite agree i   so uhm i really think that if daniel johnson is really a federalist as he claims to be i have no trust in him anymore uhm he would somehow find a way to have a complete recount because uhm what if we do have another referendum and they win  i mean really c uh god forbid they are going to be our government  i don't know what's going to happen here  but recounting the last one ma'am is not going to have any effect on the next one  well no but recounting the last one will show they really want to come clean  yeah i must say that i agree with tommy schnurmacher uh who says that he thinks there was probably no ballots destroyed in every one of the one hundred and twenty-five ridings in quebec  i wouldn't be surprised  i i believe that because i know when i went to vote uhm for the first time in my life they questioned me  yup  and i found that strange but of course i didn't know of the goings-on until after the polls closed  they questioned me too and they made me swear that uh i needed to vote in the advance poll which of course i did because i was working here during the election and when i put my left hand on the bible to do my swearing uh they allowed laugh word  it wouldn't count unless i put my right hand  how's that one for you  laugh   okay   i'd like to get after daniel johnson to make sure that we know the real truth here because i this is wrong  okay ma'am  thanks  thanks to all of you  we're out of time  boy oh boy anyway we leave as usual all of the lines hanging there  oh well you can talk to tommmy over the next few hours  tomorrow free-for-all feedback so on
