 but matt 's got that figured out  he's got a solution to that  he's got a huge screen t v with a little inset so you can watch two at the same time  right   that sounds like heaven laugh   ya ya   matt why do you do that  doesn't that confuse you  no more than your reading five books at a time he says  laugh   good point good point   ralph teases me because i i   read several books at once  uh but ya you haveta  have to have a book in the bathroom you know and uh you you need one you know just in your purse in case you're on a bus or you know you're traveling someplace so you  mhh hmm   i don't use a purse laugh   ya but you you know your pocket or whatever  and uh when i was going to school i used to have one in the front room and one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom of course  cos you read at night  and uh then one with my school books and then one in my desk so that you know when i was supposed to be reading doing my latin or whatever and it was boring i'd have the book stuck in between   word so  right   but everybody else teases me and says well how can you keep track of that many books at once   i don't know i just do  or uh like i can read the first page of a book and know if i have ever in my life read that book  really  ya  it's it's strange  uhm as soon as i i read the first page oh ya i remember this book  i you know it was about   and i and i can tell you   you know part of the outline of the story  i wish i had a memory like that  but it's only in in that sort of thing  i my memory like laugh short term memory where i put my pills down sometimes laugh is  or did i take them laugh   ya   oh no no no you've never had that problem no never no   no  but when it comes to stories that i've read uh that's different again  i i can uh   and it doesn't matter whether it's just a harlequin romance type thing or if it's  i've never read one of those  oh they not " they're" good light reading  but   i i can't bring myself to  well there's a lot that you skip over but i find that the interesting part is that they're set in different parts of the world  mhh  and so you learn different things about other countries  so you you can skip over the garbage parts you know  i was sitting in a lounge and and and   somehow the topic of harlequin romances came up and then two of the women said oh they're always the same they both agreed  and somehow they they started constructing your basic plot for every harlequin romance   oh ya   and they were both coming up with exactly what the other person was thinking of  apparently they had both read the same one coincidently  but  ya ya   ya no that's true  they are basically have a basic plot and they just uh work around it it seems  but they they make for easy light reading and so you know when you want a break from anything uh a little heavier well they make alright they're alright   they're not my favourite reading but  that's what comic books are for  come on  ya well see now i never did get into comic books  although uhm we we do use them in the school system uh oddly enough uh for youngsters who don't uhm like to read  oh i can believe it   it's a good way of getting them going you know  ya i can believe it   the vocabulary there is pretty high tech though  i remember in grade seven i used my comic books for my weekly  vocabulary lists  mhh hmm   and the words were like you know three or four syllables long and uh  quite complex  mhh hmm   ya   ya they are good and uhm i think we've found that uh archie is one of the better ones  cough   ehm  for what age group  uh grade five grade six  ya ya  because at that age boys in particular don't really want to uhm  uhm sh show either show that they like to read or uhm they don't really like to read  and so uh in order to get them interested that's one way  allow them to read the comic books  that's what i'm a bit worried about teaching english as a second language  how do i get kids who don't like reading in their first language interested in reading in in in their second   hmm   get the comic books  ya they really are good for them  uhm surprisingly because  and they're not violent  in in the archie comic books in particular are non-violent   right right   and uhm right now you know back to the fifties type attitude is sort of in and and you know the kids are into the  right   they don't seem to mind that  uhm and they can make fun of it and it's non-threatening to them  so it it they feel a little more comfortable with it  awright alright   uhm i think uh ya i think that would be a a good way   i think if i was learning another language that's the way i  i would uhm probably uh   but something that's funny  things that are funny stick in your mind you know  languages   i haven't had much with any any of the indian languages  everytime i was in a completely different area where they use a completely different alphabet much le less   and and the word  was totally different  mhh   when you go to the language camps how do they uh how do they start you off learning a language  well for me there wasn't any  it was just like you f find   you know you find out you're going to this state in india and they usually speak this language so you scrounge around looking for language tapes and   you know you find these great little books that say learn gujarati in thirty days or laugh something like that   ya right   learn japanese in an hour ya  mhh hmm   o one   of them one of the books that i came across was  really good  it had a a little section on visiting the doctor  and uh one of the things the doctor says is open your mouth do your bowels move freely   laugh you know useful useful  combination sentences like that   laugh oh god   so i learnt how to say that  i've forgotten some of the stuff   did you ever use it   no i never had to   laugh   my bowels moved a bit too freely for a while there  laugh   ya ya  the uh uh what do they call it  somebody's revenge or  laugh   oh montezuma's revenge   montezum 's zuma 's rezem  revenge   but in in india it's called delhi belly laugh   laugh   ya i suppose there's a name for it in just about every country isn't there  laugh   i i've i never really uh thought much about it but i wonder if it when the kids came here if they had the same problem  i'm sure they did  well i know they did  one of uh one of my participants   had a had a health problem  this is the one with the single mother host family  and the single mom said okay well you know want me to meet you at the hospital cos i have to go to work right now but i can meet you at the hospital  and the girl said no no no  and so the host-mother took it at face value  the girl said she could take care of herself  fine   what this girl was expecting was her host-mother to insist upon coming and and spending twenty-four hours twenty-five hours a day with  her and mothering her and you know taking care of her every whim  and need   arghh   laugh   ya   and uh that wasn't happening  it wasn't happening   laugh oh dear   cos you know the this her   host-mother was a self-made independent woman and she's got you know a lot of stuff happening and and   if a person says no she'll say okay no and she'll go and you know do something else  mhh hmm   ya  what i found was sometime i'd ask the kids if they wanted something and they'd say no and uh then uh a little while later i w realized they were waiting expectantly and i'd think  they didn't understand what i said  word   it finally clued in to me that they had no idea what i'd asked them  laugh   they just said yes or no depending on how the moment struck  them i suppose laugh   laugh   so you had uh you know you have to be a little careful there   ya   uh because uh i noticed that quite often uh uh  and so pretty soon you get to realize it's the hesitant way they say the word yes or no uh that tells you they haven't a clue what you're asking them  ah ah and it depends with which ones  like a couple of the indians spoke better english than any of the anglophone canadians in the group  like like hew   one fella fellow was the president of his college debating society back home and  he could see through every nuance that you put to every sentence  laugh   ohh   so if you were trying to say  well one of the canadians made a faux pas and kind of did a half-hearted apology for it and the guy saw right through it  he said that's not a real apology he said   and uh it was ah it was a disaster   that that particular session  oh wow   they're uhm when the kids come from india   they're really uh some of them are into college already aren't they or university   they they're all they're all   they're all at the college level ya   ya   ya  but they finish   high school goes up to grade ten or something like that so college is like senior high school  oh   oh i didn't realize that  ya  oh i see  here i was thinking my god these guys must be extremely bright  to be in college already  maybe four words   ya   cos they were nine  eighteen nineteen and they had were into their second or third year  ya   well they'll they'll  finish off their b as at the age of twenty  wow   like they'll get their master's degree at the age of twenty or  whatever   ya   now is that equivalent to our ah bachelor's degree here do you think   i'm not so sure  i don't think so either   i don't think so but don't quote me on that  no but i i just i i can't see it  i mean you can only stuff so much information into eh a person's head over a certain period of time  i know   but unless they're uh a genius uhm i can't you know  and the educational system is based i think on the old old british style where the teacher gives all the information and the students learn that information   mhh hmm   and there's no real no really  th no real thinking going on about it  like a sponge   mhh hmm   but uh it's quite bizarre  ya   i have a a young friend who is in uh  china   i thnk she's gonna going to make her home there eventually  it's been about a year and a half since she's been home on a visit and then she went back  and uh uhm she's teaching english to unversity students   in in china  she says she loves it there  awright alright   and uh she was the type that uhm in school  she could the teacher would be talking or they'd read out the text and she'd just was like a sponge  just seemed to absorb it  wow  it was incredible to watch
