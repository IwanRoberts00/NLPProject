 ya  oh here's here's uh mister houde  who's talking now  he's he's out of jail and   and he's talking and uh we're all happy to see him again  oh yes   and there's another fire  and they refer  laugh ya i know  you know it was so funny  there was fires every second day   laugh i shouldn't laugh but they're   it was horrible  and you'd think my god was there like was there like massive amounts of sabotage going on  laugh   were there german spies running around laugh setting fires to all this  cos it's like ya constantly  entrep&ocircumflex;t uh warehouses  you know and businesses and you're thinking  was this just really bad you know uhh zoning or or  or uh were they just really poorly made constructions  that that were lent themselves to fire  a terrible thought   ya   i think that's probably the case  they didn't have fire walls or uh whatever else you need to contain a fire if once it started it spread   ya   okay certainly that's probably  i mean the i the fire in the  garderie in maine i'm did that turn up  in the uh papers  no   she hasn't reached that yet  that's going to be february forty-  two forty-five   you it could be interesting   oh okay   phrase  sounds in the background, as though speaking to another person   cos it likely would have a big impact   on the way people thought it   uhm institutions   it should   that's right   that's right  and here we have more on the tramways   i was just looking at these chaps beating each other  up maybe two words   ya there's actually a better picture of that here  i've got the the word  part  it's apparently a a rebellion in uhm  uhm  what is  it's the fourth of april forty-five  it's a rebellion in germany against the nazis  mhh   basically people are  well the this that's what they've been saying anyways  mhh hmm   i didn't carry those  this just but i thought it was interesting cos they have three pictures here  it's basically these people beating up nazis  mhh hmm  and they're claiming of one of the headlines  was like you know there's a revolt in germany against the nazis  it's a little late  uh ya  april  ya laugh it's true eh  and uh so you just kind of  mhh hmm  uhm and it this is interesting  this is ah a delegation for the rights of women the wives of soldiers basically and uh i haven't read the whole article yet but i can see there's some sort of tie-in to the daycare  mhh hmm   i mean if they're asking for their rights are they going to ask for you know daycare or are they going to go the other way and say no we want money  mhh hmm   uh like the fed federal   like the provincial government seems to want to do  is to give family allocations which would basically eliminate the need for uh women to work and yet solve the problem of child poverty at the  same time   mhh hmm   mhh all right  that's certainly the alternative that was put forth over and over again give mothers money to stay at home  mhh   ya  and uh what's this   oh ya accidents of the tramway  remember i was telling you that tramway accidents are very  here's another one  they're very uh   that's   what are they  running over people  ya  running over people crashing into things   basically laugh their drivers are really bad from what i can ascertain from these articles   ya laugh any course   a couple words   they're just ya unqualified and probably women from our our previous uh   hmm three accidents and two deaths yesterday afternoon   my gosh that's just in a in one  day   ya   here's another one of these things about the children  remember this thing  but all of the sudden they're talking about czech children  they're talking about taking care of children from other  ya it seems to be an international organization that might be  because post war there's their europe is  in a state of total disorganization and there're thousands of children who have lost their parents or who are uhm cut off from knowing how to to contact them   so there's family unification is  huge issue  so i think it's reporting on that   half a million people under the age of twenty-five   now this is uh something they call the s   the the house for children  i'm not quite sure if it's for uhm children with problems or uhm uh physical problems or children with physical problems who've been abandoned but they do talk about the war the effects of the war  mhh hmm   they're going to create this house for a certain number of these children and it 's ties in well with  some of the stuff brenna's found about alternate  mhh   okay  and th and this is in france   ya these are these are  the st already established  of these are the ones that we found over   i mean right from the beginning   ya whereas this sounds   ya   grey nuns  that's right  oh okay   whereas this sounds more like it's a new thing  ya   and a again it's sort of a pulling away  it's ah more towards a secular  social services than the one that was established by the nuns and everything but i think the two tie together  mhh hmm   ya   but it was made exclusively for for  infants that are have uhm   physical and  mental word   ya physical problems   but i'm i'm really  gonna going to have to read the two articles side by side   yes   i i like to  see it in france though   oh is it  ya  ohh  this is in france uhm   is it   oh ya  look at that   okay   beau soleil so  and it's it sounds really interesting  oh so maybe  okay it's just word   a few words thought  it's modelled on the ideas of rousseau and very progressive and libertarian   ya   ya uh i didn't notice it   but it's wrong  wrong country though   it funny cos there's a lot   ya  there's a lot of articles that i've sort of   you go oh this is great and then you realize that it's not  like word laugh   laugh   yes   it's not uh here  it's over there  oh i know   there's a lot about taking care of the kids  there's a whole   series of stuff that comes up in the french paper about taking care of the kids overseas  which also seems to just peter out  word that   hmm   hmm   there's this one thing about you know  similar to the ad campaign which is about  social services but it's about overseas children and children of france  starts in late forty-four and then just kind of peters out  in early forty-five   yes   hmm   mhh hmm   uhh kay okay   uh oh that's just the me trying to copy that same   word here   all right   okay the dreams of children  they're j gonna going to do some revamping of the educational system  so it's this whole thing of of social systems just constantly being you know different parts of it being picked up  mhh hmm   okay and this is holland  but it's an interesting id idea  uh it's interesting but around the world   this same ideas are  exactly   we're we're gonna  going to have to start over  ya and it's   helps   i'm sorry  i was looking at the wrong one  i don't understand very quiet   but that's   they rev this is this is uhm montreal   ya   ya  but that that's it's interesting in the fact that and as you pointed out and actually that french one can still be used in that context is that it's a worldwide thing  ya   mhh hmm   it's like like you said last week i mean war does really perpetuate social change and  that's what we're seeing  mhh hmm   the war is ending and suddenly everywhere everyone is going to change everything  use it as a chance to start fresh  ya   at least that's what we find  ya  so uhm here's this thing about  it kind of connects to that previous article about inscription of children again  again they're they 're want   to write down  they want to know all the children   they uh you know the it's   just part of this whole sort of duplessis   mhh hmm   and the interesting thing about it is it's almost a precursor to the duplessis orphanages   hmm   it's the setting up of this infamous duplessis orphanages  it's plenty to see that in retrospect   by counting the children and keeping   well they have to count the   and special needs of children would be turning up in this  ya  and i may be reading too much into it but i think what we're seeing is uh part of duplessis' uhm grand scheme to uh take the power away from the church cos up until that point of course the church was responsible for so many facets of uh s  social welfare  mhh hmm  uh the schools were basically run by the church  mhh hmm  uh the hospitals the the  cr&egrave;ches so much is run by  and this is i think his attempt to take away that  hmm   so the fact he's counting children now i think  is very like it's the first step   you know  i see   ya   he's hired five hundred employees to do this  this is a large number   mhh hmm   this is a big project  word   this is not a small thing   okay  now here's just kind of an interesting article on just  poverty in general  they're just showing these really shabby conditions   these uh   they often do that  they show these pictures and then they don't really  follow up  mhh hmm  uh it's just kind of an article and just showing you how terrible life is and not really a mention of what's going to be done or who's going to do anything about  it   mhh   mhh hmm   but there's constantly these pictures of these really shabby living conditions  mhh hmm   this is the same area that you uh pointed out the photos before  mhh hmm   ya it looks the same but i don't even know if it is the same area  it word ahh   i think it's just basically there was an abundance of shabby-looking things that all kind of looked  alone   of the same so that uh  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  uhm okay that's not important   let's go stay with the children for now  uhh oh ya  this is kind of nice   a few words   this is more about the more of these children arriving the war brides with their children   and their children are getting older   i've seen those ya   ya   you've seen the same   ya  ya   these children some of them are three years old it looks  like   ya   page nine uhm hmm  and uh as for social problems here this woman's being arrested for beating her two kids   and who's that woman with the umbrella  oh this has i guess this is just a report on the weather  oh i see   the the picture has nothing to do with the article  it's just the general kind of picture that there was a  really rainy day  oh oh oh   i think it's february and it's raining and i think that's very unusual and they're kind of commenting on that   ahh   is it le mari et la femme  word   the husband and wife   uh three rivers   was she a working uh wage-earning woman i wonder   uh it doesn't say that but i don't think that's the issue  word   it's just the fact that that  suddenly something that was pretty much accepted before is suddenly  not accepted  mhh hmm   mhh   the beginning of the end of corporal punishment as a means of disciplining your children  i mean i it's a pretty extreme case but  uhm  mhh hmm   it's uhm they discovered the baton  eighteen pouces   i thought pouces was  fleas but the in in    eighteen pouces p o u c e s   could be inches   inches long   in what context  i guess they're describing how long this stick was  oh it'd be stick was eighteen inches long  so that would be two or three words     okay  that's that's a pretty big stick ya   laugh   that's a that's a   big stick   that's a big stick ya   pouces   ya  and three quarts of pouce   well pouces is  is inches but would we have three quarters of an inch
