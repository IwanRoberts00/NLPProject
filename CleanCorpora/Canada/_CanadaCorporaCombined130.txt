 we are back  you're listening to the timmy shoemaker talk show on c j a d  seven nine oh oh nine nine one the number to call  my guest right now is thomas j mulcair the chomedy m n a member of the national assembly   welcome to the show  thanks a lot mister shoemaker   first of all congratulations for fighting the brave fight from the beginning uh when you saw what was going on in uh your riding  now are you satisfied with the results of uh pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report  well like anybody who'd been following this since day one tommy  i i was satisfied to see thirty-one prosecutions taken against people who had vote you know organized a vote fraud   we all knew that it had taken place  and it was predictable that the prosecutions would have to come  what was stupefying however was to hear pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; go on to say that having your fundamental democratic right your right to vote stolen from you was not an attack on democracy  but attending a unity rally was  i mean that was mind boggling and there there's  no logical way to defend that position other than the fact that it was dictated to him by the p q parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois   now in terms of what was dictated to him by the p q  he looked at two-hundred and ninety boxes  is it correct he left twenty-two thousand untouched even though even though he found all of this evidence in the two-ninety that he did look at  laugh you you've   got that exactly right   let's do something for everybody  let's be there with everybody else  well that's one of the questions that could be asked for instance as far as the referendum law is concerned  it's not illegitimate for pe for people  outside a country to want to express their views about what's going to happen  in elections in the referenda or and  outside of province it's even more obvious because people in the rest of the country have a direct interest  how are they to do it if the only way to spend money is through two umbrella groups in quebec  yep  did you at all think of contacting one of the no side to get approval for coming into montreal to participate in this event  no  not at all  i mean like when they when it was brought up we had people from like  for instance we're a community college so uh we're normally in tight contacts with our community with mps members of parliament et cetera  uh the community reached out to us  they said come on  let's get down there  let's let's give a hand  and we did  we didn't even think about  it was just something that we wanted to do  we felt was right to do  and we did it  okay john   thank you very much for being with us and keep up the fight  thank you very much sir  pleasure   take care   bye bye  bye  john forest is the president of the algonquin college student association in ottawa  they were charged for renting a bus and participating in the canadian unity rally  and julius this uhm this is what  really is is the core of the matter here  should they uh be able to express their freedom of expression or because of the way the referendum law is structured there are certain impositions on that  and i guess this is a clear example to use   this you see i think freedom of expression  the supreme court has said it over and over again is particularly important  in political matters and artistic matters  it exists you know  you've we've seen that even commercial issues and so on there is freedom of expression  but when it comes to politics and artistic expression they're absolutely sacred  and here you've got a situation where all sorts of points of view may be kept out altogether  and i'll give you the list  this type of view from outside the province  satirical views mixed views uh hesitating views  i mean nobody uh the yes or no committee won't pay for people   to to say maybe one way maybe the other  it's un clears throat   it's unfair in my view  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to be part of the program  or star eight two five five if you're in your car  we're talking about the referendum law pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report  and we'll be back right after news on the half hour with  marilyn talbot   that law of course has led to pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; bringing charges against many people who participated in the canadian unity rally last october twenty-seventh  and also the outcry over pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report of the past couple of weeks of course was because he said that that violation of quebec's referendum law where people spending money to come to montreal for that rally was more a black spot on democracy than the allegations of widespread voter fraud  the rejection of no votes in ridings with high concentrations of no voters  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call or star eight two five five  and julius just before we go to the lines again i want to ask you  about that comment by c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; where he says that uh this violation of quebec's uh referendum law is more a black mark on democracy than these allegations of voter fraud  is did he mean what he said  was he just na&iuml;ve  did he is he just so sort of in this bureaucratic mindset that he is so involved absorbed with applying the law that he just didn't realize what he was saying  yeah but while we have thought that uh one violation was  if that were the case one was more important than the other  i found it incredible that remark  i find it equally i found it equally  incredible that some other commentators  there was a devoir le devoir is a montreal newspaper  editorial afterwards which supported him on that point  the uh what i would say is this  the additional spending uh is controversial  it's before the courts  the supreme court gave  there was a split decision on the court of appeal  supreme court gave leave  obviously it's something that can be debated one way or another  but if there is anything more fundamental in a voting system in a democratic system than fair counting i don't know what it is  i mean that is really a subversion of everything  and in this particular case you realize how close it was  another fifty thousand or sixty thousand the result might have been different  and then we would have been in for a real uh uh see-saw with uh first a a yes victory declared then taken away  i mean it would have created uhm scars that would never  would have taken twenty years to heal  uh i cannot see how not applying a controversial and legally uh doubtful although arguable provision can be more serious than the most fundamental uh violation with respect to counting and  and uh equality in that way  well what uh what i think is the most troubling is the fact that the yes side the sovereignist side which never leaves a stone unturned in these things did not ask for a recount in such a close vote  and that to me is perhaps an indication that there was some knowledge at the top that vote tampering took place and therefore they didn't want that to be brought forward   there would have been another argument that they didn't want for instance to being the government they didn't want to create a sort of uh uh tension that would have resulted from  you know you could have many explanations of it  the fact is they didn't act ask for a recount  and we don't know why they didn't  or perhaps they felt that fifty thousand was enough  again that there wasn't going to be a change and that it was simply going to prolong the agony  so i wouldn't draw that conclusion  but i still find mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s statement completely incompatible with basic principles of election  how about uh judge former justice alan b gold  wha where has he been in this  when i heard that he was to head up this investigation i felt that this would be a fair and thorough investigation yet we haven't heard from him  at all   well this   he made a report   he is not there to to give press conference  he made a report  the report found what was uh done  he wasn't to editorialize  the editorializing was done by mister c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; and i fear that it was wrong  uh the former chief justice did exactly what his function was which was to produce a report and to make it perfectly objective clear and step aside  now these charges that are being laid against many of these companies that boarded buses or came or spent money for the unity rally uh last october  if the case before the supreme court gets a favourable judgment  if we win this case before the supreme court that those sections of quebec's referendum law are unconstitutional will these charges be erased  these charges against these companies  well uh there's a very chance that the chances   the charges from the last referendum law if it's declared to be invalid uh will end lead to acquittals  that doesn't mean that the government will not be able to amend the law for the future cough in order to provide some sort of controls  presumably lesser controls than these  the supreme court will certainly not say i don't think there's a free for all  they're going to say this particular legislation went to far  so you're going to have to repai repair  your legislation  so i think chances are very high if we win that the present charges would fail  but there would be a new law in place for any future referendum  how would they change the law specifically  do you think they would allow other committees uh greater access into the uh ability to participate in the referendum  more freely   they would allow people   they would say everybody has the three thousand dollar spending limit  every individual  only individuals right  yeah  and you can spend the money either within or without the  outside these committees  but that already exists right now in present referendums  only individuals can contribute up to three thousand  dollars   that's right   they still feel that if they did open it up to other committees they there would be a proliferation of these small groups that would spend uh up to a certain amount and no one can control the number of those groups that are created   but but those people would still have to be limited to that same amount of money  which otherwise they could donate to the yes or no group and spend it  remember the law does not provide for equal funds for each committee  the government gives about about uhm i think it was three million dollars or something to each group and that wouldn't change  the yes and the no would each get a certain amount of money  and then the rest of the mac of the   up to i think an additional equal amount has to be raised  so it's perfectly possible that one of the groups will raise twice as much as the other and will have somewhat more money  and here we're not going outside the spending limits  we're simply allowing each individual to spend his maximum contribution  i must point out to you there'll be very few people who will give three thousand dollars  uhm hmm  uh to spend it up in any way he wants  i think the the protection is sufficient you see  i uh i find the government's fears that in the space of six weeks or five weeks it will be a million committees financed by by some mysterious forces from  probably from outside is bordering on paranoia  in order to  that was of course the explanation from both governments  since the early seventies   well so they feel that big business   big business might come in and control the result  but business cannot do it  they cannot do it because they can't contribute   it can only be individuals that's right   it can only be individuals  so its not a p q thing or a  because the p q and the liberals both gave this explanation  but i think this explanation would only hold water if they tried a looser law and it didn't work
