 well then again i mean you know them more than i do   besides i mean laugh it's like reading the obituaries listening to mom when she comes  you know all she talks about is who's died and who is not feeling well and  all the people that   well i mean you know i'd like to hear us when we get to that age  i mean that that's what you know  ya she had said she just read uh she   she finished reading the red rosaries   and she didn't like it  ya   she said she didn't like it much  you read it   ya i read it  i really liked it  hmm  but i mean it's very  but but she said she didn't find  the the the the sort of the story very original   or the or the   like her way of her des she said she didn't find anything original   two words presentation   ya her presentation her descriptions of people and and  and stuff  she said she didn't find it uhm find it   very original  she thought the beginning boring  and she thought the end didn't really like begin   didn't really like the end   liked pieces bits and pieces in the middle  well the bit i've read from her i mean breath   provinces of hate   well that's the only other thing you've read  maybe  there were points i thought it came across a bit trite you know  ya ya i sort of felt that a bit too with the provinces of hate   i mean even though eh she's describing sort of very everyday  events and emotions and stuff  and in in a sense the red rosaries is the same the red rosaries is the same thing   i mean it's just the life basically the life   of this woman of this one woman you know  but but what i found interesting was just the the you get a description of of  or a feeling for for country  for the you know for canada   what canada was like starting at sort of the turn of the century and  why  is it set back there  ya ya it's set out west  i mean she's born you know the main character she's born out out west you know  and then her her father ends up going to the states  she ends up living in the states for a while   and then you know comes back and uhm  eh eh i don't know i thought it was interesting  it's in in a sense it's a very ordinary life  mhh hmm  but but i mean it's it's  it's a life you know  from birth to death a description of of   a life  and i mean whether you know whether  it's a well-known author or or you know  did i tell you that the first apartment that i rented here in montreal uhm and then left that it was her daughter that took it over  i had known her just touchingly from winnipeg you know just  just   no  oh   i remem remember   you mentioning something about that  didn't you say she wasn't really nice or something  well i left the phone in my name and  thought nothing more of it  and she didn't pay the bills   cough   and she ran up all these bills   ahh two hundred bucks  and then in in april maybe whoa i got something through the mail i mean breath   but what at your new address  i don't know how they traced me down but they found me  i mean i i thought it was all over and done with  i thought by now she would've you know changed it to her name and and you know  would have been gone   changed it to her name   take care of it   but no there was a outstanding bill of two hundred dollars  and and threatening threatening threatening correspondance  you know i i took it first thing to the office and i explained look i know i'm not supposed to have done this but i just left it in my name and you know and and  i'll pay you everything and  and and   ya   ya   well i mean the people down here that i saw are not the people who conducted the correspondance  you know they just said   ya ya   they were they were okay with me  they said ya   but i mean what  the end result is what laugh you had to pay this two hundred dollars or what did you do   oh i had to pay it   sure i had to pay it  but i mean they claimed at least that it wouldn't affect my credit rating  you know   ya   but exhale breath you know that's the same one who  ah but how did she get this apartment   i bumped into her somewheres not 'somewhere' and she was looking for a place and i was looking for a way of unloading   the the the ya   where you were  where you were staying  ya   and that's end of tape   now i must have been to a movie within the last year  laugh   maybe not  geri and i were were uh talking about high anxiety  the mel brooks film laugh   and

time when i watched television but i haven't had mine that thing  plugged in since i moved in  and uh   that would make a nice aquarium  i'd like to do that with a t v sometimes laugh    laugh   kinda kind of word  it  try to fix it up and  it would be cool  it'd be really nice   ya   somebody had one  oh ya  ya   i know chris wanted to do that  some where was i  seeing one  i don't know   might have been in the window of uhm astral books  some artist had one  he had an old one  and old like old fifties t v  cabinet that he'd stripped out  huh   wow   put a goldfish bowl in  put goldfish in  one or two word there anyways  that's pretty neat  one of the things i like to do is going out and uhm cough  in july doing the alleys and picking up stuff people throw out  but you're not actually moving laugh    ya ya   it's pretty uh pretty cool  that's where that came thing that thing came  from  that's nice  it's uhm i move it around and i hang it on the wall because that's what you do with something that's like that but laugh   ya ya   but uh i don't know  it's kinda kind of interesting  i have a friend who uhm who does similar stuff like that  a an artist  and uh he uhm had this mage this wire mage  and he'd do weird things with stuff he found on the street  there was a great manhole cover at the corner  of of of bloor and spadina in toronto i had admir admired loved  for years  uh huh   it was uhm had a grid pattern on it  but was cast in bronze or maybe brass  uh huh  but whereever the traffic had gone over it it was it was i mean it was it had it was  grids but it also had raised bumps  like raised squares uh on  and the whole thing was circular  and whereever there was a raised square had been polished by tires  okay   so it was shining and gold and slightly   ru like burnished and then the rest was was uh was just you know dull  it was just it was just 'a' not said gorgeous thing  and i used to always want to steal it and make it into a coffee table or something  yaa  uhm last time i was in toronto they're putting this uh   like uh l r light rail like raised streecar thing  down the middle of spadina  and the place where i was was ripped up  it was not  i mean i didn't steal it cos i thought you know it would have been it would be rude to steal a manhole cover out of the centre of a busy street laugh   laugh   anyways somebody's got it  it's gone somewhere forever  huh  and i'll never see it again  but it was a really b beauti  beautiful   it's probably sit sitting in some scrap yard somewhere  it was just a gorgeous thing  cos the sun used to hit it and it would just shine  it would be like this like this like like   this there's a gold grid in the centre of spadina when the sun was setting   wow   you know it was really weird  it looked sorta sort of wet and shiny  i just figured out what i'm gonna going to  do  i have this x-ray from from when i was down south and uh when i broke my hip  so i have this x-ray of my broken hip laugh and i wanted to do something with it  some kind of light  put it on the wall  i don't know but a a coffee table would be a good idea  put some glass over it  is it uhm yup  yup  yup  good  what's it i mean it's just made out of x-ray material  that's what i'm thinking of   i it's just an x-ray  right   i it's just  a uh a regular film  and   ya   right you're just going to build   nega negative uh build a light table  and take it in laugh   ya why not   uh hip laugh   laugh   this is somebody's hip laugh   that's it ya that's right   that's a that's a very hip table   laugh   i wanted to do something with it  there was there was a   a real story behind it  we had to get a guy from uh uhm from  nation air to bring it up to my mom and had him have it   seen by the doctors
