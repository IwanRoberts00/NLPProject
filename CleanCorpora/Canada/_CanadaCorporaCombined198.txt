 as opposed to running off the guards maybe i think she should've gone in  i really do  on that seventh end with jodi sutton's final stone she should've asked her to draw in perhaps  on the seventh end   yes i really think  that's that was the shot  they couldn't get rid of all the guards and if they get it in first it puts a lot of pressure on new brunswick   that's the only stone in play and heidi hanlon will attempt to take it out of circulation   heidi's a real favourite among all the curlers  two years ago in kelowna she won the sportsmanship award  she's a wonderful person to play against  she just wants you to play your best and for  she wants to play her best  she got a nose hit on that b c stone   can julie sutton take advantage of that long guard   oh there's lots of room  it's just a question of where she's gonna going to  put the brush and how much she thinks it's gonna  going to curl in there   colleen remarked that this would not the rock  would not curl in this particular location but  but the hits have been moving so   so it'll have to break at the end for them to get by that guard and get it buried   and there's one thing about y playing the uh kind of straight turn  if you ever get it in around the guard it makes it very difficult for the opponent to take it out   they have to throw a little bit more weight   the key too is throwing it to your sweepers and make sure your sweepers are having control and being able to keep it all the way  if you throw it to the tee-line and don't allow your sweepers to  be sweeping it it doesn't move as well   as soon as she let it go julie sutton said tight   oh what a great shot  now if they can get it in   ah beautiful brushing by the front end of b c   see how close she was to the guard   the advantage of brushes in curling  going by guards and playing in the four-foot area   well swept by the front end   well the one thing about it for heidi hanlon if she can duplicate the same shot and maybe go not only go   by the corner guard don but the one that julie sutton just put there and get it in the eight-foot then it is really gonna  going to be difficult for julie sutton to get there   word   she has a lot of room  you'll see it's well still on the line  she she's got a very dead handle on this don  there's not much rotation to it so it should move pretty quick at the end   she puts it in the back of the eight to become shot   well julie sutton can get right back in the game if she can  come down that same path and push back that yellow-handled new brunswick stone   she will trail by just one   and she played the whole end to get a hit on the nose  heidi hanlon with her first one hit a corner guard on the nose  and now julie sutton's gotta got a great chance to get back in this game  she cannot afford to throw too much weight on this rock don   if she does it's gonna going to run very straight   she's well inside that line   oh she's got a great looking shot   oh a beautiful shot by julie sutton   so after giving up the steal of two on the seventh end julie sutton and her b c champions come right back on the eighth end  two excellent shots by julie sutton with her final stones to pick up a pair  she had to skin that guard with this rock and out-turn takeout  and she was on target  a nose hit on the shot stone to get her deuce   so after eight ends of play just one point separates new brunswick and british columbia and our live coverage will continue in a moment  tv advertisements   and we will be on hand next saturday and sunday at the copps coliseum in hamilton for the semi-final and the final of the labatt brier but right now we're watching the final two ends of the nineteen ninety-one scott tournament of hearts from saskatchewan place in saskatoon  five four new brunswick leads british columbia   two stones in play both to the left side of the centre line  which is really to the advantage of heidi hanlon of new brunswick don because she has last rock   and british columbia because the rock is fairly close to the centre are gonna going to try and go around it but unfortunately soligo just rubbed the guard  a little bit of a break by rolling into the rings but that changes the whole complexion of this end don because now if new brunswick hit and stays on this rock british columbia's gonna  going to have to play a takeout game where they are trying to steal a point to get back in the game  cannot afford heidi hanlon to have any rocks in the house   so by rubbing that guard has changed the whole complexion of this end   sheri stewart the new brunswick second is the leading percentage shooter   she's at eighty-nine percent   does she get a perfect score on that one  yes   the key for british columbia here now they have to make a play on this rock don  they'd lid like to get a little bit of movement on the shooter to the left maybe around those guards   there was a point a little earlier as you see the time clocks in the background where new brunswick had used up more time than british columbia   the situation is now reversed   the time won't be a factor  they both have twenty-four minutes left and that's plenty of time  i'm still waiting for the day and i hope it never happens that a  team runs out of time and then you forfeit the game   yes  what if the team is leading by about four at the  time laugh   exactly   more importantly what if they're playing the tenth end and the other team is up by nine  laugh   we may see the first contact curling   anyway by hitting and rolling out there it allows new brunswick now to utilize those corner guards don and hei   heidi hanlon's decided to go at  round the corner guard score two points and maintain that three point advantage that she had in the eighth end   two point advantage would certainly uh put heidi well in control and in the driver's seat  by the same token she doesn't want to get in the situation where she's forced to take one although being up two without isn't that bad a situation uhm   you'd rather have last draw at coming home or be three up   a little deeper than she wanted   exactly  that rock is behind the tee-line   it allows julie sutton to ask jodi to freeze to it   if it was in front of the tree tee-line  she couldn't do that   you know this b c team is a very physically active team   very disciplined   they participate in uh weight strength and endurance training during the course of the year   and i think from curling teams except maybe at the senior level we're seeing more and more of that   laugh   yes we certainly are  it's a long long week and you do have to be in fairly good shape in order to not get tired by the end of it   you do a lot of curling   jodi sutton has an excellent shot  aw what a gorgeous what a pretty curling shot that is   and that was the danger  the new brunswick rock settling behind the tee-line don  if it was in front of the tee-line british columbia couldn't have done that   you heard kathy floyd yelling way out there  and if she's got any kind of weight that rock will not move for her   look at it stay on that line   that's downtown  yes   as they say in curling she has definitely flashed it meaning missing altogether  during the course of the week colleen it seemed that when stones got on that centre line with draw attempts there was just no way of stopping them  that's right  it's got you gotta got to   wait for it to cross that centre line before you get the movement   well there's one thing about it  they're giving new brunswick lots of opportunities to get around the guards cos there's three of them out there   the danger here though is that rock is over a little bit more and they're having to take more ice to get around it don and that might be an area where it runs very very straight   and this ice is very sensitive   outside the centre line it's liable to run straight  if you're just a fraction heavy you hit the centre line and it's liable to curl   oh she looked like she threw that one pretty good   that's right  you mise might as well bring it back  the deeper you take it the more it'll bury   that's a pretty good curling shot   she went by the guard by maybe a good six eight inches don and the rock did its curling at the end and it's about uh half buried   you can see it there   just board weight   you do not want to overthrow this rock in this particular area  key shot here for the twenty-two year old sociology student at the university of victoria   boy she's close to that guard   no she rubbed it   so the end is now set up for new brunswick to get a pair and victory   now you play it to the open side   leave that rock on the four-foot and you pull it   play it away from those corner guards   this situation prompts a team meeting for new brunswick  okay   the decision has been made don and they're gonna  going to go in this area which i think is really dynamite   they should put the rock over in this area here and it has to be in the eight-foot because if they come if b c comes   down and hits and rolls over here they may not end up shot rock   i think this is a bit of a bad call  i really do   because if they put it in the top of the twelve-foot and b c hits and flops behind it then you've got major major problems  or if she puts it out a little bit and sets them up  for the double here  aw   you never draw to the open house or split the house when there's a whole bunch of guards on the right-hand side  no way   and it looks good for calgary to advance probably to the nationals once again  you know you know try to end their  o for seven streak in toronto   well they they lost both their final games against manitoba   ah that's true but i put my money on them word   that might upset a lot of guys   two seconds one second it's over   the calgary dinosaurs winners here tonight four one  and winners two nothing in the series so they advance and the bears'  season comes to an end after a thrilling three game playoff victory over lethbridge last week-end  they lost the lead in the third period last night here  steve and would never lead again  well   that's it  that was the killer  and uh losing paul strand for both games in this series uh  wasn't expected especially when he put on such a show last weekend and uh yesterday getting kicked out and today having to leave with uh what looks like serious hip or a charley horse injury  uh ah really tough for the bears but nothing to hang their heads about  they had a hell of a year   nobody expected them to come in the basically  in the top four and they're easily the second best team in  word or two canada west   four and one in the final and uh strand in a classy move by the alberta forward just standing down by the dinosaur bench to shake hands
