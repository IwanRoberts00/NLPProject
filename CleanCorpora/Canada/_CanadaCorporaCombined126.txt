 uh the story says that uhm part of i  that this is in fact part of the p q's political party  programme to extend uh to gay couples pension benefits insurance benefits and other things that are now available to heterosexual couples  and the ministe according to the story the minister of justice paul b&eacute;gin is really in favour of this and kind of pushing the idea   but his boss uh premier parizeau has never been very keen on it  according to the article  and in fact during the election uh the p q he said that the p q would not go faster than society wants to go on this issue which a statement which didn't really uh gain him any favour in the gay community  uhm so uh some of the commentators though in quoted in le devoir today say that it would probably be very profitable for the p q to try and regain the support of  the the gay community though now just o   on the eve of the referendum   and the gazette local newspaper is continuing its investigation into truck safety  their uh top story uh   big front page story yeah   is today is that uh the uh uhm i it say   says it says that uh uhm a union official uhm is saying that uh truck safety inspectors who work for the uh  soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'assurance de l'automobile  quebec's transport safety authority are being pressured by their bosses  to skewer uh statistics to make the roads look safeter  safer than in fact they really are  uhm the inspectors' union says that its uh members are told to do random mechanical checks of the trucks and to avoid singling out trucks that appear to be unsafe  and uh the gazette spoke to a soci&eacute;t&eacute;  official about this and he actually seemed to confirm that in fact that is what they want  they want random checks  they don't want their inspectors looking for  for uh trucks with problems  mmm   union basically saying that the roads are a lot less safe than  w than we think even we think they are right even less safe   then and then the fact the   st the statistics reflect that they are  yeah  the uh the the reason that the uh soci&eacute;t&eacute; does this at least according to uh uh what they say seems to be a concern to get statistics that get random r  a random sample and to get accurate statistics rather than to get unsafe trucks off the road  hmm  does that make sense  yeah and it sounds as if there's a mixed message there  it certainly does  yeah  or mixed priorities anyway   mixed priorities yeah   page three of la presse is almost completely devoted to problems at city hall today  at the uh top of the page is a story uh saying that just when the city wants to lay off employees it's had to hire seven hundred temporary blue collar workers this summer  and this is because apparently thirty percent of its permanent blue collar workers are on vacation in the summer  but the problem is the summer is the busiest time of the year for them because that's when the roads are fixed and the   the parks are are maintained and uh  flowers are watered and so on  uhm at the other other times of the year in fact montreal ha is uh has blue collar workers with s uh with not enough to   do   to do   according to the story   hmm and timing is everything  that's right  uhm the city wants to change this with in   its new contract with the blue collars but of course uh they've been in mediation recently but that mediation apparently has broken off for the summer  so it there won't be any   quick laugh there won't be any quick  resolutions to that  problem   laugh   there's a lot of irony on thr  page three of la presse this morning  that's right  the other kind of ironic story is that well you know how some people in in some neighbourhoods in montreal they've started getting their garbage picked up every day  mm-hmm  well y on page three in la presse uh  it's quite a picture isn't it  that's quite a picture  there's a story about a daycare centre in c&ocircumflex;te-des-nieges that had to wait two and a half weeks to have its garbage collected  uh the daycare did a big clean-up and put out some old tyres and bro a broken dishwasher and wooden cases and things like that on uh third of july   there are old records in here   are there  there's some old seventy-eights at the front  well apparently some people were going through it because it was out there for two and a half weeks and people were going through it and really uh culling some of the best stuff   boy i'll tell ya you   venetian blinds they got it all  heh you shoulda should've  gone down there laugh   laugh garage sale  but and when they did this it got spread all over the place so it really made a big mess  mm hmmm   uhm this was that they had put this out for the the big you know the big collection that the city does um just after moving day but nobody came  and it wasn't until yesterday that they came but of course   it came they came a half an hour after the daycare had contacted la presse about the story  so i wonder if there was a coi   coincidence if that's laugh  was a coincidence there  cos you said timing is everything  laugh   and the strange thing is that the city doesn't seem to have an explanation for that  the the person they spoke to says well well maybe it was a we we had a lack of staff  he he wasn't too sure what the reason was  but he was on vacation so he couldn't talk  laugh maybe that was it  maybe it maybe it's tied in with the blue collars  i'm sorry i'm just leaving the office     okay we'll talk to you in an hour  thanks a lot sally salvy with the press review on daybreak  but sally salvy is here as she is every morning at this time with a look at what's in the papers  are you managing to get any sleep these days  i know a lot of people are having trouble with this   this hot weather that it's so hot and sticky that they can't fall asleep and when they do they just keep getting up every couple of hours  it's hard it's true   yeah   but uh i s i actually do a fair amount of sleeping in the daytime so   oh so that's the bonus yeah   well maybe laugh   do do the kids sleep okay   i never really word   they have a they've  w well i have fans kind of pointing at them and they seem to be alright  we and when it gets really hot then we  move to the basement or a deep breath or e  even down to our living room  so uh  if you have a basement or an air conditioner you're lucky this summer  yes definitely  and apparently air conditioners well for a while there they were pretty hard to come by  i don't know if that's that's uh gotten any better  but uh there there's really a run on them in the stores  lots of news in the papers this morning  well yes and uh the big news today is of course marijuana  the marijuana story is back in the papers and the focus in the french press is that nobody wants to do anything about it  the story is that uh up to a million plants are being cultivated on crown land in kanesatake that was the story that broke yesterday  today le journal de montr&eacute;al 's local french language newspaper front page says the authorities wash their hands   and the headline in ah la presse is that the ball is being passed back and forth between ottawa and quebec city and that certainly seems to be what's happening  the federal government says kanesatake is not a reserve it's a community in quebec and therefore comes under the jurisdiction of the  securit&eacute; du qu&eacute;bec quebec provincial police force  but meanwhile premier parizeau is saying that the pot is growing on crown land and so it's a federal responsibility  the grand chief terry cloutier says that the r c m p  royal canadian mounted police should deal with it because he doesn't want the s q coming into the area  and uh he said that he only found out about the m   that marijuana was growing in kanesatake on monday night through the media but there's a lot of scepticism about laugh this  uhm and in fact on the front page of la presse  there's a picture uhm in which uh the man in charge of security for uh  the the uh the band joseph ouellet is pointing to a field where he said he burned twenty thousand marijuana plants on the first of july so this can't be the first time that the  the band council has heard about it  by the way we'll be speaking with ouellet in the last half hour of the programme this morning  probably speaker said 'probambly' about uh ten minutes before nine o'clock  i know that's a long way away for most of you but if you are near the radio you wanna want to hear more about this story and uh directly from him this guy in charge of peacekeeping then  we'll we will be talking with him at the end of the programme  intake of breath   there are also reports that family members of joseph ouellet are in fact behind the marijuana growing operation so that's a story that's not going to go away pretty word    the the one thing that we haven't heard yet and i'm sure we will some columnist is going to bring this up is that uh they you know they  wouldn't be growing this if people weren't smoking it  you know that  and uh this would be just another weed if uh there wasn't that factor involved  laugh   so although people are pointing fingers at the different parties so far the one party that hasn't been pointed at is those people in the public that smoke the stuff and uh  that'll come up though  trust me   yes   i'm sure all the angles will be explored  la presse uh has a story today saying that uh a company called canadian life is now offering to buy the insurance policies of aids patients  this is a phenomenon that's existed for some time in the states  but it's new here and there was an amendment to the civil code in quebec to allow this to happen uh so now this company is here doing this  and what they do is they pay an aids patient fifty-five to sixty-five percent of the value of their life insurance policy  canadian life then takes over the premiums they pay the premiums and then they collect the the benefits when the person dies  the paper says that a montreal doctor who works with aids patients has agreed to help the company  and this doctor whose name they don't give in the article says that a lot of aids patients have no money and uhm no family and that this could help them live their final years uh in more comfort  but the paper also quotes a law professor at the university of montreal who says that he has an ethical problem with this  ignace gosselin says that it's it's   sort of like betting on the death of the sick  so he didn't word   yeah i you know   th that's the thing they uh   fr from what i can gather from the story and from what i've seen in the states is that uh the people who are involved in the business end of this are selling it on its practical merits  ah however uhm when you examine the ethical uh problem here as the  university from montreal uhm university of montreal   professor uh comments that uh th there   are some s some uh serious questions that are raised by this and uh i know a lot of people are uncomfortable with this  well another problem with it is that they only pay fifty-five to sixty-five percent so there there is a big profit to be made by this they they   get quite a big cut out of the insurance policy  and uh yes there there are a lot of questions   that's right second overlap occurs over extracorpus text
