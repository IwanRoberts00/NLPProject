   well doug we squashed doug's little account of what's going on there with galileo into one of those little one minute news reports but we've got a little bit more of him explaining  just what galileo is and what the scientists hope they're going to get back from it   galileo is a product of the time that astronomers call the golden age of planetary exploration  back in the nineteen sixties and seventies when budgets were higher  a fleet of intelligent sophisticated robots were sent out to survey the solar system  and there were always two  viking one and two went to mars orbited the planet mapped it then sent landers down on the surface that tasted the soil looked for life took full colour stereo pictures  voyager one and two did the grand tour of the solar system visiting jupiter saturn uranus and neptune  and seeing more than fifty moons along the way  many that had never even been seen before  galileo was to be the next step  it was to go to jupiter and stay there  orbit the planet  look at it over a long period of time and for the first time  sample that atmosphere  send a probe right down into it  well with budget cuts and all of the other economic realities that hit nasa there was only one galileo  so the astronomers were forced to put all of their eggs in one basket  and because of that it's been a frustratingly long wait for them  right from the beginning galileo was delayed  if it had gone according to its original schedule it would have already been over ten years ago  it was supposed to fly in nineteen eighty-two and it was only supposed to take two years to get to jupiter  well delays in the program put it back to nineteen eighty-six  then the challenger disaster with the space shuttle which blew up  that put the program back to nineteen eighty-nine  by that time they had to find a different way of going to jupiter  one that took six years instead of two  so for some of the astronomers who've been working on this program they've been waiting almost eighteen years for this one mission  and for those who've been waiting for the data from the probe  all of that wait comes down to just over an hour  seventy-five minutes is the only time that that probe is going to be sending back data before it's crushed by that jupiter atmosphere  and even after the spacecraft was on its way there had been problems that have plagued the poor galileo spacecraft  its main antenna which unfolds like a big umbrella got caught on a metal strap so it doesn't have the proper shape to be able to send signals at the earth  so they have to use a very slow back up antenna  and they had to cut down the number of pictures down from fifty thousand that they were hoping to take down to maybe three or four thousand  at the same time they've had to rely on a tape recorder that  can store the data and send it back at this slow rate  and the tape recorder jammed and almost broke so now they're being very ginger with that to make sure that it works  but even though it's had its delays and had its problems and it's had frustrations and everyone is biting their nails as it finally gets to jupiter galileo has done some remarkable things  while it was on its way to jupiter it took the very first movie  of the earth turning  which is a rather remarkable thing when you think about it  we'd never seen the earth turn  we'd seen it from space but never actually moving  galileo did that  it also saw the first asteroids  we'd known they had been out there  we've never seen them close up  it passed two of them on the way here and even found a little tiny moon going around an asteroid  a total surprise to everyone  and while the amount of data galileo brings back might be limited  it's still exciting because we've never been inside jupiter  for me i've been there throughout this entire exploration of the solar system  i've seen the pict pictures  tape cut out live from the planets and seen worlds that have never been seen by human eyes  and you relate to these spacecraft almost like pets  they're out there in this very hostile environment  they have a hard time  you hope they survive and you kind of encourage them on  come on galileo you can make it you can do it you can go there  so i wish galileo well and hope it succeeds in its mission  that's doug mackenzie host of quirks and quarks our national science program here on c b ra c b c radio    that can be heard every saturday right after the noon news weather and sports uhh right after well it's nine minutes a nice package of information there and then quirks and quarks comes on with doug mackenzie  here on c b c nine forty in montreal   ah canadiens are playing in pittsburgh tonight so the test continues for them  and we keep saying that and it would have been a test for mario tremblay anyway with patrick roy in the line up had they gotten along famously  fact is they're not  they're facing mario lemieux tonight in pittsburgh  should be a very tough game for montreal  patrick roy will probably get the start for the avalanche tonight  they are at home against the edmonton oilers  and the avalanche play very well at home  they've only lost once there all season long  among the eight games in the n h l tonight  one in quebec major junior hockey  sherbrooke is at drummondville  and for boxing the canadian amateur championships get under way today in brampton ontario  ninety men and fifteen women will try and qualify for the team canada that goes to the nineteen ninety-six atlanta olympics  and canada's top sprinters have agreed to run in the hamilton indoor games next month  that includes montreal's bruny surin  that starts january twelfth  the meet uh in montreal will be uh on the nineteenth of january  well it's supposed to be the end of the rush hour but it doesn't look that way from the uhh problems that we have  d&eacute;carie southbound a stall in the lefthand lane at jean-talon  metropolitan westbound a couple of stalled vehicles there as well  left hand lane just before d&eacute;carie circle  and another one also left lane just before veuillot  and the met westbound is pretty much bumper to bumper all the way from the anjou interchange to d&eacute;carie circle  highway twenty westbound that accident was cleared away and it is uhh working much better than it was before so you should have less trouble getting out to the airport  uh the mercier bridge we have an accident just reported on the span there  so uh not uh not a good end to the rush hour  the champlain though has cleared out fairly nicely  cost you about ten minutes there  same thing for the victoria  though coming off the victoria bridge you will find things slow if you decide to get on the bonaventure because we have the uh sun youth doing a collection of donations along with the m u c police at the corner of saint-antoine and university  and that is backing things on to the bonaventure  and one last look at thirteen southbound and yes they did arrest a motorist there for driving with a dummy in the passanger seat  and you would think thousands of people would get arrested if that were the case and they did it everyday  but you're not supposed to do that in the reserved lane on the thirteen southbound  you have to have a real person in the passenger seat and you have to be at least two people in your car   it's three minutes now before nine and ah once again forecast high today probably minus two  should see quite a bit of sunshine in the course of the day  overnight tonight it's gonna going to  get cold down to minus fifteen  lots of sunshine for tomorrow but cool temperatures  minus eight the forecast high for tomorrow  some snow on the way for saturday  not clear yet how much at this point  it looks like not very much  that could change  keep listening  and for sunday a mixture of sun and cloud with a high around minus three  let's listen to a little more of danielle martineau in a style we'd be maybe more expecting from her song   you're listening to daybreak on c b c nine forty in montreal  good morning i'm johnny gore   thanks for joining us this morning  cool out there  minus seven  the skies are quite clear though  at least  throughout the day we'll be expecting a mixture of sun and cloud this thursday the seventh of december intro music   skies clearing out overnight tonight completely  temperatures dropping down as low as minus fifteen  we're ah heading towards a cold and sunny day tomorrow  sunshine with a high of only minus eight  we're expecting a high of it could get up   to minus two for midtown montreal  uh but generally minus five that kind of thing  so it's not going to be a great great day  uhh for the weekend and of course the weekend is in the forecast at this point we're talking about a little bit of snow for saturday  at this point they're saying at least five centimeters  maybe more depending on on how the system develops  but we should see a bit of sunshine on sunday  variable cloudiness for sunday  uhh highs around minus three minus four for the weekend  fourteen minutes now after seven  and let's go out into traffic right away with peter larue   two major events there right now  uh first of all i'm presently at the intersection of ah university and ah saint-antoine  ah today and all day the m u c police montreal city police  uh are ah doing a l  le special collect to the benefit of ah sun youth ah  they were here ah trying to ah collect ah with all their  flashers  trying to be ah very ah visible  but minutes ago a an unfortunate accident happen not " happened"   a pedestrian was hit ah by a car  the ambulance right in front of me  and they're about to ah clear up the sector  but it's a real bad start ah for that ah that  operation uhh here  so if you're in the bonaventure expressway beware of some ah delay  but within minutes uh they should clear the sector  secondly on the highway thirteen real bad start this morning  we have now a second accident  thirteen south just before the highway four forty  this morning police uh uh word metro detachment in conjunction with uh saint-eustace are blitzing  so beware of a ticket operation uh they're not changing their plan as of right now  and on highway thirteen ah once again it's a real bad start and it's going to be a real bad day   we heard last hour incidently for those of you who may be facing uhh thirteen this morning that ah the ministry of transport is on the scene  evaluating they say  they are going to be reviewing their decision to have that reserved lane on the thirteen  uh as soon as they gather some data today  could have a decision by the end of the week  a spokesperson from the ministry of transport told us this morning that ah they might roll back that decision to have that reserve lane  so i guess we'll have to wait til the end of the week on that one  fifteen minutes now after seven  incidently the chief of the m u c police jacques babineau  will be joining us this morning  that's right after the news at seven thirty
