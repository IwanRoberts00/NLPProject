 it's a spring day on the northern thesque prairie near  hattiesborough alberta  i'm traveling north and the wind is howling like it sometimes does at this time of the year  mile after mile along the highway i begin to notice that the melting snow in the ditches is black in some places and not in others  wherever there's tilled soil there's blackened snow in the ditch  in nineteen ninety-six more than sixty years after the dustbowls of the dirty thirties the soil still blows on the prairie  today we'll try to find out if agriculture is sustainable in alberta  it has been estimated that farm production has doubled since the nineteen fifties due to technology  but does that say anything at all about sustainability  the question we try to answer here on the chevron ecofile is how are we doing and is it sustainable  in terms of agriculture this is indeed a loaded question  technologists at alberta agriculture told us we're doing pretty good and that gross production with inputs meaning chemicals and fertilizers is a good measure of sustainability  but the key ingredient in sustainability is the health and productivity of the ecosystem  emmanuel creppin of the sustainable agriculture association said that what's being done today is not sustainable but he concedes things are improving  uh however there's uhm on the other other  side there's ah an increased uh awareness by farmers of uhm environmental protection from the point of view of uh uh soil conservation and uh preservation of uh biodiversity   soil quality is one of the key ingredients for sustainability in agriculture and according to a new agriculture canada report called the health of our soils we may have overestimated soil degradation in the past  the authors conclude that we've lost fifteen to thirty percent of the soil organic matter on non-eroded land since cultivation  soil organic material is what holds water and releases nutrients for plants to use  land without organic matter becomes in effect a surrogate mother requiring additional inputs to produce crops  technology is able to compensate for depletion of the soil  chemical fertilizers and herbicides can improve production quite dramatically  the question remains is modern agriculture sustainable  fred mcgratton is a farm management consultant in winfield alberta   in terms of sustainability in alberta i don't think we're doing very well at all or in canada or in north america uuh on any of three fronts uh socially uh ecologically or financially in agriculture  extracorpus speech continues   according to agriculture canada the risk of wind and water erosion in alberta went down by about ten percent between nineteen eighty-one and nineteen ninety-one  that is good news  summer fallowing on the other hand is still a problem on twenty percent of alberta's farmlands  the thinking is is that if you rest the soil by not planting a crop one year and control the weeds by ploughing the field  summer fallowing which used to be seen as a way of resting the land and you know controlling weeds and so forth uh is probably the most destructive practice uh we have in agriculture extracorpus speech continues   it has taken half a century for thirty-five percent of alberta's farmers to stop summer fallowing  one of the common complaints about modern agriculture is the extensive use of monocultures or planting vast fields of the same species which critics say can be financially risky and ecologically dangerous  we need to get very serious about trying to increase the number of species of plants that are on our land extracorpus speech continues   to mcgratton farming is not simply a matter of applying better technology with the goal of always increasing production  he says this strategy's created higher but unsustainable levels of production financial stress for farmers and a lack of desire for young people to stay on the farm  so what if i'm a farmer on the treadmill  what can i do  you need to start looking at a what do you want out of life and why do you need the big tractor and the big land base and all the inputs and so forth and and b are you  start planning profit and look at every enterprise you're running and saying okay let's say i ran three hundred thousand dollars through my bank account last year and i only kept twenty extracorpus speech continues   that's it for this week  next week we'll look at one family that's put the family  back in the family ranch  a ten thousand acre cattle ranch might be the last place you'd look for a dramatic new sustainable form of agriculture but join us next week when we travel south of hattiesborough alberta to talk to maureen  and ryan suggs about the h y ranch where success has as much to do with the number of bird species as it does cows   at its root sustainable development is about overcoming some of the world's most serious problems such as overpopulation global warming and pollution but having acknowledged all that perhaps what sustainable development is to each individual is quite simply the creation of a better more sustainable life for ourselves  consider marco polo   he farms three hundred and sixty acres near allenton  alberta  at first glance you might be hard pressed to see this as a sustainable development story but at its most basic level sustainable development is not a complicated concept  it's about living within our environmental means and about minimizing our impact on the world around us  marco polo does this by self-sustaining by not consuming too much and by providing for as many of his needs as he can with locally-grown products  today we'll travel to allenton alberta to discover  marco polo's unique brand of alternative agriculture   allenton is a small town south of athabasca alberta  the population a hundred and sixty-eight  this country can best be described as boreal forest  it's well north of the aspen parkland and the prairies of the south  marco polo's grandfather farmed and his father farmed but despite that he went to the big city to work as a geologist  but in nineteen eighty-six he returned to his roots when he bought a small farm in northern alberta  i asked marco to describe his operation  i've got about three hundred and three hundred and six sixty acres  extracorpus speech continues   marco's strategy is clearly one of diversification  marco decides what to do on each part of his farm based on its suitability  well what i have to do is is   i i i farm on the basis of holistic management rather than like i say as as as some traditional farming practices where they look at piece of land they say how can we make this produce more grain   on his relatively small farm marco polo farms trout raises cattle has hay land and crop land he logs and near the busy highway he's built a market garden  marco is the consummate opportunist  whether driven by sustainability or just good old fashioned gumption he has a unique ability to integrate his operations  to give you a ah like example of what i'm doing is  is i've i've planted trees on a hillside to prevent erosion   marco's farm woodlot operation had recreational beginnings  i have in this creek valley about a hundred and twenty-five acres of trees and and and in that hundred and twenty-five acres i created a system of about ten kilometres of trail just virtually crisscrossing the entire forested area  extracorpus speech continues   but as fate would have it marco's ski trails eventually became logging trails and today because of the trails and  marco's unique operation the manoc pulp mill pays him to maintain a demonstration forest  marco actually saws up aspen and uses it as lumber  he sells the by-products as pulp the leftovers as firewood and the knowledge he gains in his books  another kind of neat little thing that i do is  is i b i use beavers  in my logging operation extracorpus speech continues   marco looks at his trees as r r s ps registered retirement savings fund   when most people head off to the bank to purchase r r s ps  marco heads outside and plants trees thousands of trees  he's calculated that a dollar's worth of trees planted in nineteen forty-seven would produce sixty dollars worth of logs and lumber in nineteen ninety-five  that's a pretty respectable nine point one percent annual return on investment  the point is to return nine point one percent plus think of all the benefits you get extracorpus speech continues   an interesting concept but let's not stop with marco's  r r s trees  what if the trees he plants also serve as a shelterbelt for the farmhouse or the livestock  if you plant a shelterbelt around your house you'll save probably ah between one-quarter and one-third your heating costs   that's the house  but what about the livestock  marco says a well-planned livestock shelterbelt can save you fifty dollars per head in feed costs by keeping your cows cosy in the wintertime  by now you can perhaps see how a word like eclectic  might stick to a guy like marco but there's still one more stone we've left unturned  marco's next project and his next book he's already written two is going to be a building a twenty-two hundred square foot home for under thirty-five thousand dollars  he plans to build this by supplying the lumber from his trees the labour from his back and the land from his farm  marco polo calls what he does alternative agriculture  in his market garden he probably derives as much income from the experience of berry picking as he does from selling the berries  he's also got some more trout ponds and some cabins in the woods in mind  where else can you stay in a cabin made from beaver-logged aspen  marco's books are farming alberta published in nineteen ninety-five by big pine publishing and good farming in the woods   if you have trouble finding them they're both available for twenty dollars each from the author at box two nine three allenton  alberta t seven p seven k seven   that's it for this week's feature report   it's a disturbing trend but according to the world watch institute in washington d c the number of farm pests developing resistance to pesticides is growing rapidly  by nineteen ninety-three over five hundred species of insects and mites around the world have developed resistance to one or more pesticides meant to control them  in addition one hundred fifty plant diseases and one hundred thirteen weed species have also developed resistance to pesticides  it's trends like these that have led to pressure to reduce the emphasis on chemicals on the farm  in ontario farm pesticide use is down thanks to the urging from farm groups and a government program that seeks to reduce chemical use by fifty percent  in alberta thirty-one hundred farmers have voluntarily taken a farmer pesticide certification course offered at olds college  even biological control methods are vulnerable to fast evolving pests  researchers are now working on integrated pest control methods that use fewer chemicals and more biological controls  they're also trying to avoid pests by using carefully developed crop rotations  that's it for this week's facts and trends  i'm annie gillis   facing the challenge of creating a sustainable world is a daunting task  in fact close consideration of global issues like population growth and global warming can be downright depressing  this fact was brought home to me recently when my thirteen year old niece tammy rae mcgratton told me one of her big worries is what the world will look like under global warming  it reminded me of worries i had as a youngster about nuclear arms  roy lansing knows all about these problems but he's a solution oriented kind of guy  today we'll gaze into an environmentally sustainable future  music   roy lansing 's roy lansing is  an author a futurist and he's a member of a think tank set up to design an environmentally friendly community on vancouver island  we caught up with him at the recent striking a balance conference in edmonton where he was asked to lead a discussion about creating a sustainable future  his entertaining and positive style captivated and recharged the audience of urban planners politicians environmentalists and developers  in a serious but amusing futuristic scenario lansing  predicts everything from solar power revolutions to employment for the unemployed and the rise of compost modernism all in a brave new sustainable future  he warns of rising food prices as food shortages become more and more common because of population growth  he predicts the fall of shopping malls and the rise of community trusts mandated to stimulate local business and self-sufficiency  his message is one of hope and one which he says proves things can be turned around in twenty short years  rather than feeling overwhelmed about important global issues  roy lansing faces them head on  i asked him how he was able to take such weighty issues and apply his contagious enthusiasm to them  well it's partly a personal thing that i  i extracorpus speech continues   part of dancing's inventing the future involves tackling some of the biggest issues of our time  consider global warming  changing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide one of the most common gases on earth could have devastating implications  but rather than dwell on the consequences dancing  presents solutions that allow anyone to see a future of possibilities  extracorpus speech   think of the possibilities if you could unhook yourself from the power grid  better yet how would you feel if your meter started to run backwards on those hot sunny summer days when your solar powered roof is producing one hundred and twenty percent of your power needs  extracorpus speech   creating a sustainable future requires economic environmental and social sustainability  the walking school bus helps out in all three areas  extracorpus speech   indeed imagination is all that stands between humanity and a sustainable future  ray dancing says it's time north america dropped its nineteen fifties vision of life as commuters in the suburbs and substituted something more functional something more environmental and something more sustainable  as an environmental and community development consultant for  orington a pioneer sustainable community of twelve thousand people on vancouver island dancing has a chance to put some of his ideas into action  it's an experiment in community level sustainability that focuses on community composting biological sewage treatment support of organic food producers and even the protection of a small old growth forest
