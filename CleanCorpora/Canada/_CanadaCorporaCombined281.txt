 since nineteen seventy worldwide bicycle production has soared from twenty-three million to one hundred eleven million per year  today three times more bicycles than cars are produced each year  according to the worldwatch institute that's a good sign of sustainability  not only do bicycles avoid nearly all of the greenhouse effect causing of cars they don't require nearly as many roads that eat up valuable croplands  this is especially important in asia where half of the world's population is supported by only one third of the world's cropland  according to worldwatch institute growing interest in the car has already caused bangkok thailand to pave over most of its famous canals with roads to reduce traffic congestion  about six hundred new cars are added to the streets of bangkok every day  now that's the equivalent of three kilometres of bumper to bumper traffic  at this rate it will only take four years or so to fill the entire road system with one solid lane of traffic  worldwatch says this rate is unsustainable in physical terms that any tourist can see  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   ray dancing's an author  he's a consultant to a major community project on vancouver island  and he's a futurist  but most of all ray dancing has a knack for facing down some of the world's most challenging problems with spirit and enthusiasm  today as we continue our conversation dancing predicts an ensuing food crisis will send guerrilla gardeners into the streets in search of golf courses and boulevards in which to plant food  we'll also ask ray dancing why he thinks gross national product is a poor indicator of sustainable development music, 20 seconds  according to the worldwatch institute the nineteen ninety-five grain harvest was a was the smallest in seven years  in fact food production is fifteen percent below its historic peak of three hundred and forty-six kilograms per person in nineteen eighty-four  when you juxtapose declining food production with the world's population which is increasing at a rate of ninety million per year you begin to see the potential for serious problems  we spoke to ray dancing at the striking a balance conference held recently in edmonton  i asked him what implications increasing population and the greenhouse effect pose for food production  extra corpus speech, 2 min 15 sec   farm prices are already going up in alberta and grain prices are also on the rise  as if rising prices and growing population wasn't enough to deal with questions are also beginning to surface about diminishing returns from the use of technologies like pesticides and herbicides  extra corpus speech, 1 min 35 sec   if there's one repeating theme we've heard in our series about sustainable development it's a trend towards schemes that are more ecologically inspired  waylon riggs told us managing his ranch was far easier and smarter in an economic sense if he worked with instead of fighting nature  foresters told us in our series on sustainable forestry that ecosystem management is a scheme that will not only grow good trees it'll also help preserve bio and genetic diversity as well  and this is at the heart of dancing's vision of a sustainable future  it's not enough to simply talk about integrating environment economy and social needs you have to do it  for a long time gross national product and economic growth have been principle indicators of economic progress in the western world  dancing thinks the time has come to question growth and the g n p as key measures of progress  extra corpus speech, 2 min 15 sec   if ray dancing's right we may all eventually realize one of the original promises of technology more leisure time  that would certainly be a contrast to what we've seen so far higher stress levels very little job security and high unemployment  ray dancing also has a theory about shopping malls  he thinks they'll soon become a thing of the past  he says the return of the neighbourhood store and the growth of internet shopping will be the driving forces behind the death of malls  he predicts shopping malls will be will respond  by redeveloping their huge parking lots into little urban eco villages complete with homes shops and a neighbourhood square  if you're interested in ray dancing's ideas watch for a new book he's writing called two thousand and fifteen or get on the internet and search for ray dancing   that's d a n c i n g   you'll find plenty of articles and other information about sustainable communities  next week british author jeff danes thinks part of creating a sustainable future is for humanity to reunite its ties with nature  you're listening to the chevron ecofile   that twenty year-old lawnmower may belch out black smoke every time you start it but hey it still runs  and that's precisely the problem says boris yechokovsky  with environment canada's mobile emissions division  lawnmowers snow blowers and other small engines can be hazardous to your health   using your lawnmower for an hour belches out the same amount of pollution as driving your car for six hundred fifty kilometres  yechokovsky says environment canada is investigating two possible solutions  the first is a catalytic converter that would sell for around ten dollars and could reduce emissions by up to fifty percent  the second solution being investigated is alternative fuels that could reduce carbon monoxide pollution by as much as sixty percent  part of the problem is we all use these small engines at the same time and since carbon monoxide is about the same density as air it just hangs around poisoning you as you do your lawn  fuel spillage is also a problem as hydrocarbons are rapidly released into the air whenever you miss the tank   the state of california already has plans to force manufacturers to cut emissions by two-thirds by the year nineteen ninety-nine  but you could do your part today by keeping your engine tuned or by borrowing a neighbour's push lawnmower   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   danny dressel is one of alberta's best known naturalists  he once said man's improving on nature is indeed very close to impossible   he also said the protection of wilderness is more than just an aesthetic it's absolutely necessary   in fact most albertans agree with danny dressel   the united nations brundtland commission on environment and economy reported in nineteen eighty-seven that protected areas need to be at least tripled to constitute a representative sample of the earth's ecosystems  the commission also indicated that saving species in their ecosystems is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable development  when alberta wrote its own sustainable development plan the completion of a system of protected areas was front and centre  today we begin a series of programs that will examine how alberta is doing at protecting natural ecosystems   alan van dusen was a naturalist an albertan with a very special appreciation of the world around him  he's a biologist a hunter an admirer of flowers a communicator and someone with a real knack for helping people see how the pieces of our complicated world fit together  i asked alan van dusen why we need protected areas  extra corpus speech, 1 min   but protecting nature is not just about buying insurance against the failure of human experiments  it's also about who we are  extra corpus speech, 1 min 20 sec interview ( question and answer) between a and z, 6 min 10 sec   that's it for this week's feature report  next week we'll try to find out how alberta's doing in the battle to protect vanishing ecosystems   there's been a long and distinguished history of creating parks and wilderness areas in alberta  it began in eighteen eighty-five with the establishment of banff canada's first national park  since then waterton lakes jasper elk island and wood buffalo national parks have been created  at almost forty-five thousand square kilometres wood buffalo is the largest national park in the western hemisphere  but according to the alberta government reports most of alberta's diverse ecosystems are still unprotected and in some cases vanishing  today we present part two in our series on protecting alberta's endangered ecosystems  speech, 30 sec   that was elaine sahal of the alberta wilderness association  alberta is short of protected areas  this may come as a surprise to many people who already know that alberta's blessed with some of the most beautiful parks in the world  but most of these parks were established to protect economic interests or national curiosities and not ecosystems per se  alberta's a wonderfully biologically diverse province  ecologists divide alberta into six major natural regions the grasslands aspen parkland boreal forest foothills rocky mountains and canadian shield  these six natural regions are further divided into twenty natural subregions  according to the alberta ecologist and author alan van dusen  the natural regions that are most endangered are the ones we live in  extra corpus speech, 3 min 10 sec   the idea of protecting alberta's ecosystems has been around in draft government reports and policies since the late nineteen seventies and early nineteen eighties but it wasn't until nineteen ninety-five when ty lund alberta's environment minister released the special places two thousand plan that it became government policy to protect ecosystems  according to doctor jay allanson of the university of alberta this is important because for the first time alberta's agreed to a scientific approach to protect ecosystems  extra corpus speech, 45 sec   according to the alberta government's nineteen ninety-five state of the environment report only four of alberta's twenty natural subregions are adequately represented  they include the alpine subalpine and montane natural subregions in the rocky mountains and the peace river lowlands in the boreal forest  if the government's own assessment of its progress isn't bad enough there's a scientific debate going on as to whether the montane is adequately protected  alan van dusen explains  extra corpus speech, 25 sec   van dusen says that more than five hundred and fifty square kilometres of montane in jasper and banff national parks is severely compromised  i asked alan van dusen what indicators tell us that things aren't well in the montane  extra corpus speech, 1 min 20 sec   very little comes easily in the struggle to protect alberta's natural regions and the options diminish with each passing day  less than twenty percent of the original grasslands are left and as little as five percent of the aspen parkland remains today  the world wildlife fund recently awarded alberta a b for progress on protecting endangered spaces  that's a major improvement over the f it received a year ago  alberta was recognized because environment minister ty lund promised to protect alberta's ecoregions by nineteen ninety-eight and for legally protecting willmore wilderness park north of jasper  since the program was launched alberta has created two new provincial parks twenty-seven new natural areas and one new ecological reserve  that's it for this week's feature report  next week the environment minister has promised to protect examples of all of alberta's natural regions by nineteen ninety-eight  can it be done  find out on next week's program   alberta has a colourful history of creating parks and protected areas  it all began with the protection of banff hot springs as a crown reserve in eighteen eighty-five  two years later in eighteen eighty-seven rocky mountains national park was established   little known to most people three national parks have been created and abolished in alberta's history  in nineteen oh eight buffalo national park was created near wainwright to protect bison   wawaskesy and nemiskam national parks were created in nineteen twenty-two to save the prong-horned antelope  all three were abolished by nineteen forty-seven because the antelope came back and bison were being protected elsewhere in wood buffalo national park  if these parks existed today though they would protect some of alberta's most endangered ecosystems   in nineteen thirty-two alberta created its first four provincial parks aspen beach gooseberry lake park lake and saskatoon island  today these small parks are among the most popular recreation sites in alberta  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm annie gillis   alberta has been blessed with some of the most spectacular landscapes you'll find anywhere  but as oil and gas agriculture forestry and cities push to the last frontiers the province's natural ecosystems have begun to show signs of stress  alberta's special places two thousand program seeks to ensure examples of those rare and beautiful natural landscapes are preserved for future generations  but critics argue the program is so full of holes you can drive oil rigs and logging trucks through them  today we present part three in our series on protecting alberta's endangered ecosystems  a nineteen ninety-six environics poll found that eighty-nine percent of albertans were in favour of completing a national network of protected areas even if it would result in reduced forestry and mining
