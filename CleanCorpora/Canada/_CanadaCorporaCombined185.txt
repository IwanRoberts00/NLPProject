 and i would think that rob daum will be working on some sort of a play off the start of the third period  what a golden opportunity here  they get the break and uh can work on a couple of plays i guess if they win the win the draw and try something and then they'll have another one up their sleeve if they uh win another draw and they haven't scored yet so  definitely  he's ah a very very a great coach technically and he'll have something up his sleeve  and as soon as they get set up we'll see the good five-on-three happening  all right four three the pronghorns lead the golden bears after two periods of play  we're back with stan friel's athletic spotlight  that's up next  you're listening to golden bears playoff hockey on sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight commercials, interview, and news, 14 min. 25 sec.   third period's underway  bears on the powerplay trailing by a goal  they're down four three  here's a pass to jickling on the left point   they're got a five-on-three now  tipped away at the pronghorn blue line though   the bears will have to regroup as jickling turns  he'll move it in across the line  flips it in the left corner  good chance for kelln to clear and he does   bears on a five-on-three powerplay for another fifteen seconds  as trevor sherben starts out from behind his own net  lead pass left side to haney  ahead to strand  back to haney  the pass just behind him  strand has it high on the left point  now over to trevor sherben  his shot went off the glass   and the pronghorns able to clear it to the line but not out  now they'll clear out as gatto's out of the box   and here's strand skating at centre  he lost it   carpenter trying to pick it up  jickling lost control   two pronghorns after it deep in the bears' zone and jickling drops it back for trevor sherben  he'll have to hurry  gives it back to jickling   bears forty seconds left in the powerplay  they give it away  here is gatto moving in  gatto takes a look  his pass is blocked and it's behind trevor sherben   comes up on the left-wing boards  and here goes strand to centre  strand takes a look  steps in across the line  strand falls on the play trying to pass  that's broken up  here goes carpenter  carpenter to the line   offside pronghorns though and we get a break  so the bears still seventeen seconds left in the powerplay and seventeen seconds left of course in the minor penalty to jarret zukiwsky  and not what the doctor ordered or c  coach daum ordered thirty-five seconds with the two-man advantage and uh uhh nothing actually  and bears too much trying too much  to do too much uh by themselves  not enough passing   not enough set plays  and uh you got eighteen minutes left twenty  twenty minutes to start the period there's no need to be doing everything by yourself yet   changed some scoring on us and uh changed some assists so we'll update you on that in just a moment when we get a moment's time  here's krywko with it in his own end   dangerous goalmouth pass but he got the pass away  and bears clear but can't get it out  here's harper moving in  lets the wrist shot go  that bounces into the corner   there's filipenko for it for lethbridge  that's broken up  and krywko will chase it down in his own corner   that's it  the pronghorns are back to even strength  here's a shot  save by masson on the short side off of graham  bears try to clear up the wall  they're in a little bit of trouble in their own end  here's graham centring   esposito took a whack at it to get rid of it  now thompson plays it over to esposito and he backhands it in across the line  it goes in behind the calgar  calgary the lethbridge net   in the right corner there's thompson trying to pick it up  aaron zarowny digging it free   zarowny takes a look  walk out  lets the shot go   and that's blocked and cleared down the ice into alberta territory  masson sets it up there for christiansen  his long lead pass for thompson  thompson turns and put it right on the tape of rieder's stick  rieder now for o'rourke  off-wing shot that missed the target but not by much on the short side   and here's aaron zarowny with it behind the net   zarowny trying to clear it ahead  zukiwsky steals  he takes a look  centres through the goalmouth  nobody there for lethbridge  bears can't clear though  rieder holds it onside  zukiwsky knocked it down but christiansen has it now   christiansen lost it in front of his own net  dangerous play  and o'rourke couldn't centre   now christiansen battling for it behind the net   puck up along the boards  pinching in from the point this is knippel  his pass that's blocked   comes through out front again   finally the bears clear  here they come   this is simpson  three on one  simpson moves in  passes across  thompson  he missed the net   holy smokes he missed the net   that wasn't the indian ocean  it was the atlantic   he had to one-time it though   missed the target   now fighting for it in the corner colin zarowny  passing out front  out of the reach everybody  and here comes kelln to centre   his lead pass  carpenter moving in  it's offside  boy oh boy bears had a great chance to tie it up   and in fairness to mike thompson i think the puck may have been rolling on edge but a glorious opportunity goes for naught  well mike thompson it it was a tough shot you're right evan cos it was on edge and it   it was also in his skates  he's a right-handed shot on the left-hand side  it was in his skates   he kind of had to choke up and uh volley it out of the air like soccer  and uh it's too bad  he missed on the short side  real quick  they've changed the assists on mark goodkey's goal the first one of the game for alberta  mark goodkey still gets the goal but merv haney and mike jickling get assists   that was at six forty-eight of the first  and the assists we didn't give you on degner's goal in the second period jickling and thompson get credit for assists on that one  so bears trailing by a goal  here's trevor sherben to the line and across   he goes down as he had a little help  pulled to the ice by mark wobick   now trevor sherben trying to send it in deep  here's a long   well they tried the long feed but jeremy riehl thought better of it   here goes trevor sherben  gave it away whoa laugh almost in front of his own net  jason dasewicz was looking for it  haney in looking for the puck in uh lethbridge territory but gatto fishes it free inside his own zone  bears pick it up though  haney now to jickling  jickling cycling it in behind the net   strand didn't anticipate the pass and there is carpenter with it   carpenter trying to send it to the bear line  he cannot  degner with it now   degner drives in across the line  degner takes a look  can't get past the defence  this could go as icing   back to play it is pullishy   as he touches it icing is the call  quickly what happened in that second period terry degner tied it up for alberta on the powerplay at nine eleven  mike jickling and mike thompson with assists   but then lethbridge pulled ahead again at eighteen eighteen  dana rieder from travis kelln and harper   that came at eighteen eighteen on the powerplay  so the bears trail the horns four three as we play in the third period here  by the way the shots on goal in that second period twelve four in favour of the bears  so they've outshot lethbridge thirty-one fifteen  lethbridge an opportunist team though   they've put four past masson in this one  and scoring chances haven't been that im wide of a margin though  shane roest with it behind his own net for lethbridge   he'll stride right out front   skates with it  flips it up to graham   they get it in across the line  esposito a chance to move it  he cannot  it's kicked in a little deeper  now esposito will battle for it   flips it up to the point not out  puck sails wide of the alberta goal   and after the puck adair able to poke it out to centre ice   flipped back in by knippel  goes off the back boards and krywko's there to play it   krywko starts from his own end  flips it ahead   here's degner on the right wing  degner takes a look  stick stickhandles in across the line  takes a backhand shot and a stick save by cavilla  there looked to be a little bit of room there  here's a shot by adair   saved by cavilla   and he'll hold on with fourteen seventeen to go in the third  tune in tomorrow night  we'll have game two of this best-of-three series  we're on with our pregame show at seven o'clock   the game starts at seven thirty  pretty good crowd down here  although it'd be nice to see an even a larger one tomorrow night  jeff   it could be better  and uh uh fourth-year man terry degner is is  showing some leadership out here in the last  uhh in the first six minutes of this third period  he's playing heads-up hockey  he's making some nice plays   and he's not giving the puck away  i don't think the uh coach daum told uh in the the pep talk in between periods for   his their d-men defenceman to throw it in front of their net a half dozen times laugh at the  at the start of the third period  it's been scary here   on the draw dana rieder wins it away from aaron zarowny and it's cleared out to centre ice by the lethbridge pronghorns  trevor sherben will fire it right back in  back to pick it up mike krooshoop  he gave it away at the blue line  trevor sherben put it right back on his stick   and it's cleared down to the bear line  here goes o'rourke moving in  o'rourke trying to stickhandle in on masson  masson knocks it down  it's underneath him   referee lourdes blows it dead as o'rourke fell  and that's always a dangerous play for the netminder when a player goes down <, regardless of how and the play continu es and he's sliding in toward the net  ya the puck could have go  gone been anywhere under masson   luckily for him it was under his pads and not behind him  uh they got the big line out here again zukiwsky's line   and uh against uh zarowny zarowny and simpson  here comes jickling to take the draw once again in his own end  but uh this has been a a good story tonight and they've matched up well  and uh zarowny's line definitely hasn't been outclassed by zukiwsky's line  jickling against zukiwsky on the faceoff glovehand side of masson  on the draw bears try to clear it out   they can't   now they get another chance  aaron zarowny with it  flips it ahead for simpson  simpson's got a step on the right wing  simpson jams on the brakes  lets a shot go  save cavilla  they jam  and they shoot off the goal post   it's loose out front   and it's scooped into the body of one of the golden bears  and there's going to be a penalty  he's getting a penalty   good call by the referee lourdes   and it's probably a good play by darren rieder  oh   dana rieder pardon me  as he jumps on the loose puck outside the crease and he'll take the penalty  the net was wide open again   man i think i believe   that was colin zarowny who had the tap in at the side of the net  after a a super play by kent simpse  simpson the initial shot
