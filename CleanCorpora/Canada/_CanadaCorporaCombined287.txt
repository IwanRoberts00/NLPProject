situated on the equator borneo runs twelve hundred kilometres east to west and nine hundred and sixty kilometres north to south  about eighty percent of the island is blanketed by some of the oldest rainforest ecosystems on earth  according to a book called nomads of the dawn by wade davis ian mckenzie and shane kennedy politically borneo is claimed by three nations  indonesia has the southern two thirds  brunei is an oil-rich sultanate state  and the northern states of sarawak and sabah are part of malaysia  malang foru represents the penan  they're from the high mountains of sarawak a malaysian state where more than half the population is native  we talked to malang when he was in edmonton recently about his people their plight and sustainable development music playing  thousands of indigenous people roamed the forests of borneo at the turn of the century  today only eight bands of eastern penan remain fully nomadic in the ancient rainforests of borneo  these eight bands comprise three hundred and sixty people the representatives of age-old cultures that lived in harmony with the rainforest for thousands of years  malang foru is a member of the kelabit tribe and he represents the tribes of the penan  the penan is a culture of hunter-gatherers that until not so long ago lived in perfect sustainability with the ancient rainforests of borneo  i asked malang what he thinks of sustainable development  speech, 50 sec   malang comes from a culture that has been harvesting rainforests for centuries  but whether they hunted wild boar cut down the odd sago palm or gathered fruit in the forest the forest continued to survive and evolve as it always did  today these rainforests are being logged at a breakneck pace  according to the nomads of the dawn the international tropical timber organization predicted the exhaustion of the primary forests of sarawak by the year two thousand  and there's little irony in the fact that the environment minister for sarawak owns a trading company that's doing the logging  given this context i asked malang foru what he thinks  sustainability is  speech, 40 sec   the logging in the rainforest is described by the malaysian government as sustainable  the nomadic penan of sarawak are afforded no claims to the land that they've occupied for thousands of years  not only is the sustainable lifestyle being lost entire cultures are being lost as well  speech, 55 sec   malang foru explains that this new form of so-called sustainable forestry is taking power away from their communities  he says it has to do with freedom freedom to choose how to use their own resources and freedom for their children to choose what they want to do  culture normally evolves at a painfully slow almost evolutionary pace  but for the penan of sarawak changes come like a bolt of lightening from the sky  speech, 1 min 5 sec   according to the book nomads of the dawn revenue from logging in sarawak accounts for fifty percent of the state budget   these state revenues are derived from a royalty of just two percent of the selling price of the wood mostly raw logs  only about five percent of the people of sarawk are employed in logging  on december second nineteen ninety-two malang foru  addressed the united nations' forty-seventh general assembly   recorded speech, 1 min 30 sec   malang foru was one of those kelabit people who came down from the mountains to be educated in the new world  today he's living in exile in vancouver british columbia where he continues his fight for his people and his home  in a world larger than our imagination it is sometimes too easy to stay locked inside our own economic and cultural context in our search for sustainable paths to the future  that's it for our feature report  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends  by the year twenty twenty-five more than forty percent of the world's population three billion people may experience chronic water scarcity  this according to sandra postel writing in world watch magazine  as rural populations continue to migrate to the cities they take water with them  water for agriculture is being lost  in addition ground water is being overpumped and aquifers are also being depleted in many countries   according to postel no one has tallied the potential effect on future food production   it takes up to one thousand tonnes of water to grow one tonne of grain  no one is sure where a sustainable supply of water will come from in the future  the number of large dams has climbed from five thousand in nineteen fifty to thirty-eight thousand today  but this strategy has also had many environmental side effects  as the demand for water intensifies many river deltas and coastal estuaries are losing their capacity to support fisheries  the lower reaches of china's yellow river have gone dry an average of seventy days a year in each of the last ten years  the aral sea in central asia has lost half its area and three fourths of its volume to cotton production   as a consequence twenty out of twenty-four fish species have disappeared and the fish catch of forty-four thousand tonnes per year has been lost along with sixty thousand jobs  searching for ways to sustainably use water will become critically important in maintaining environmental social and economic stability in the future  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   the penan of sarawak in the northern mountains of borneo are a nomadic people  for centuries they've wandered the remote and ancient rainforests of borneo hunting wild boar gathering fruit and harvesting the odd sago palm  the penan are among a disappearing group of people that represent the palaeolithic era a time before agriculture  according to nomads of the dawn a book about the plight of the penan it was the advent of agriculture that led to a sedentary lifestyle  modern forms of religion and the separation of humans from nature  according to the authors of the book the separation of humanity from nature set in motion a savage assault upon the earth by human societies  music   malang foru has witnessed the onslaught of modern society as it has swallowed his people in just one single generation  his opinion of development sustainable or otherwise isn't very high  speech, 50 sec   it's not hard to understand malang's perspective  he comes from a culture that lived in perfect harmony with the ancient rainforests for many thousands of years  he listens to us in western society talking about sustainability but his experience has been that modern society means logging ancient rainforests and the displacement of his people and their sustainable way of life  to malang at the very least sustainability should involve the welfare of his people and the protection of their rainforest home their culture and their way of life  i asked malang what he thinks the peoples of the planet should do to strive for sustainability  speech, 40 sec   as it is now the penan and the other rainforest peoples of borneo are relocated re-educated and the land in their old territories is handed over to logging companies  malang speaks of sharing and healthy communities as values that are critical to sustainability  but this is what's being lost as a consequence of so-called development  ironically bob tatar the author of several books on sustainability told us previously he believes sustainable development requires as much as anything a process of social evolution  he spoke of sharing revitalizing communities and the reversibility of decisions as important signals of sustainability  malang says that development has unravelled the penan's relationship with the land and each other   speech, 40 sec   according bob tatar's criteria an action needs to be reversible to be sustainable  living in the forest is a life far from the industrialized consumer world of wants and desires  the penan are a nomadic people  they operate using a concept they call malong   speech, 1 min   the next season the tree is there to be rediscovered and claimed yet again  the tree belongs to the community and to nobody at the same time  land ownership had little meaning to the penan until they were confronted by those who wanted to take it away  as a consequence the malaysian government does not recognize their claim to lands that are their traditional homelands  today only eight tribes of the penan are still living nomadic lifestyles in the mountain rainforests of sarawak  malang told us he believes sustainability can only come from local people who are closest to the land  speech, 40 min   there seems little question that industrialized society has distanced itself from nature and more than a few indigenous peoples and philosophers think it may be at the root of our cavalier attitude towards the earth  but if indigenous peoples like the penan have an answer to living sustainably with the earth as did each of our ancestors they do not believe these peoples wouldn't make the same mistakes given the same tools  speech, 45 sec   humanity has the power to permanently alter the planetary ecosystems  perhaps this is why bob tatar says part of the secret for sustainability lies in social evolution  that's it for our feature report  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends   the u s environmental protection agency just purchased fourteen ozone detecting instruments that were originally developed by scientists at environment canada  it's called the brewer spectrophotometer and it's the most accurate ozone detecting instrument in the world  according to dan rowe leader of the environment canada team that developed the instrument the brewer is about the size of a suitcase  it monitors stratospheric ozone twenty kilometres above the earth by measuring how much damaging ultraviolet radiation hits the ground  the brewer ozone detectors are sold by sytech instruments of saskatoon and the u s order is worth two million dollars  one hundred and seventy-five of the instruments are installed in thirty-five countries around the world  when used in conjunction with the satellite data the brewers ozone detectors have helped map and track the ozone hole over the antarctic  this last winter or summer for us the antarctic ozone hole was not as bad as nineteen ninety-three the worst year on record but at times ozone levels reached seventy percent below normal  over canada the hole is not quite as pronounced but in spring ozone levels can drop to eight percent below normal and in summer four percent below normal  any drop in ozone concentrations could have negative effects on humans and other forms of life  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   it was after writing a book called planet sustainable  harmonizing culture and nature that bob tatar came to a new understanding of sustainable development  like many ecologists tatar initially greeted the concept of sustainable development with a distinct lack of enthusiasm  but just a few years and four books later bob tatar's  become an advocate of sustainable development  he believes humanity can find sustainability through social evolution  today we begin the first of several discussions with ecologist and author bob tatar music   i was reminded of the issue of overconsumption recently when laura love was performing at the edmonton folk music festival  she's a performer who came from a life of poverty in the south-eastern united states and today she's a successful record producer and performer  as you can imagine her perspective is a little different from that of the average middle class north american  in one of her rhythmic and evocative songs less is more she brings her own twist to the quantity versus quality dilemma
