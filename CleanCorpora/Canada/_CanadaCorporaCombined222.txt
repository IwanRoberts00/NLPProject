 and the other aspect of it it has it has   to be uh profitable has to be something in it has to be some money otherwise it's a hobby  normally there uh eighty a hund  hundred ah eighty percent of business ideas come from people's hobbies or their work   uh in your working situation working for somebody else you'll find business opportunities sometimes selling your services back to your employer as a contractual worker   you'll be in a win-win situation  in other words if you can work from home and do everything you're doing at work and show your employer how to pay you less and no benefits no no whether sick days no vacation and at the same time now you get to write off all the expenses  then you've just found a business opportunity  hobbies are another big area for business opportunities   well my name is jessica mailing   i am a volunteer here at the gallery and what i'm to do this afternoon is to take you on a tour of the upstairs galleries  mainly european some american   uh and the tour's normally an hour long  and you know just go along and look  the gal the galleries are arranged chronologically in a big v starting here going down there across the the ah the the bottom and then up here  if you look across to there you can see a word  so we're getting up into fairly modern art over there  and since that's the way we're going to go i just do uh a sort of a cursory development of uh art art   we'll have a little bit of art history  we'll have some looking at paintings  you know just what whatever you you want to do  are you interested in anything in particular   answer   hm  answer   italian paintings  ya   we're starting right here with italian paintings  this is uhm this is an italian  well let's start right here   uhm a painting by simone di martini of siena which is among the earliest things that we've got in the gallery  this was painted about thirteen twenty   it's uhm on wood   tempera on wood which the word hundreds  were uh on wood panels  this is word to be part of a triptych ah ah a three part probably a devotional piece  probably a private devotional piece  this would have been  the left hand side there would have been ah ah a middle one  somewhat larger  that was a mother and child and that one is still uhm on display in orvieto  the one on the other side is lost  they don't know where it is  but they the the way they can tell that the one in orvieto is part of one is because of this punchwork along here  this is called punchwork  and it exactly matches up with the one in orvieto  so th they they were at one time part of the same of the same triptych  uhm plain gold background  this was uh at this time they wouldn't have put a landscape in there or anything to distract  cos this is a religious painting you were supposed to concentrate on the uhm on the figure  who was st catherine of alexandria  now people of of that day  thirteen twenty would have known right away that this was st catherine  because uhm they they hid uh in religious paintings and and they're not only in  word ones some later ones uhm have got clues in them   attributes shown along with the saint that tell you who they are  and so catherine's attribute is a wheel because she was uhm  put to death or they attempted to put her to death on the wheel  tying her body to word wheels  and rather nasty results  well actually the wheel shattered and uhm she was freed and  she in the end she was beheaded   but the wheel is the attribute of st catherine  and wherever you see a picture of st catherine you'll find a wheel in it  uh sometimes on the ground  sometimes she's holding it  the wheel is her word   and it has the spokes that you usually find in in  the word   also to indicate that she was beheaded she has a sword in her hand here  she's got her hand around the top of a sword  and she has a pen to indicate that she was an author  so you see you've got all kinds of clues  they would also have known that she was uhm from a wealthy family by her clothing  by her halo you could tell she was a religious person  so a lot of things that go right over our heads were   uhm could be there quite easily in in   uh uh in the days that uhm that that   simone di martini was painting  but it's typical simone di martini  it's typical siennese in the beautiful elegant line of the siennese  the siennese did not were not so interested in modern inviting   although the use of shadow in her face here but it's pretty flat  pretty two-dimensional  but this is there's this marvellous line that comes up and you can just follow it around  very elegant  very uhm uh very graceful   now if you have any questions or you want to make any comments go ahead any time you want   uhm if not we're going to keep going cos if if  we're to get around here in an hour uhm we really have to keep moving   another italian painting uhm of the italian renaissance by piero di cosimo  uh and it is the italian renaissance and there are a number of things about it that indicate that this is is is  really what the renaissance was about  it it the subject of it is vulcan and aeolus  vulcan here with uh the sword  vulcan the glo god of fider uh   g god of fire   aeolus was the god of the winds  and he's shown here with a a huge pair of bellows making the wind that keeps the fire going   uhm the reference is to uhm first of all mythological  figures  vulcan and aeolus were were gods  and this is what the renaissance was about  going back to greek and going back to greek mythology going back to the early days  uhm as was the importance of the human being humanism  uhm and the beginning of man as the important thing  the beginning of civilization uh which was seen to begin when man got control of fire  up until this time uhm fire was was  something that happened but you couldn't control it and it was usually destructive  but uhm vulcan who this is brought fire to man and man could use it for his own uses to cook with  and here he's shown making horseshoes  and so with that comes civilization  and people began to tame animals  uh they begin to build houses  they begin to live in family units  and so you have uh the beginning of of  society and and this is another focus of of of the renaissance  uhm under that is a chest  it's called a cassone chest  that's the italian word  it's well i suppose it's sort of like a hope chest   uhm it was what brides got and grooms got it too to put   their their uh belongings into  it was used in a home uh for as a place to sit as a as a place to put things  the reason it's here there here is not because they want to demonstrate a cassone chest but it is here to inform these two paintings over here   two little paintings done by uh filipino lippi who was an italian renaissance painter working probably in the workshop of botticelli  and these paintings when they were made they're not made to hang on the wall in a sense like you see them here  they were made to go on a cassone chest  and cassone chests were uhm very often decorated with three paintings  and you read it well in a series  you read em them read it starting over there on the left end  that would be the first part of the story  then a big painting across the front  and then the denouemount would be uh on this end here  and so these are two that were commissioned by an italian family  one was the story of esther the the the  jewish biblical heroine  and the other one was the story of mordecai  esther went on the woma woman's  the the the bride's  chest and mordecai on the groom's chest   and uhm this one here the the  esther did the bottecelli did not do the painting  or it's not known exactly whether he did or not but it's thought  that he probably turned it over to filipino lippi who was one of his star pupils and who did a lot of these cassone chests  so you see esther uhm approaching the palace  uh the king has sent for a number of young women to come in  he's going to pick a new wife   and that is the one in the far end  and the big one here which is in france shows the king with the women assembled who does pick esther  and the one on the end which is in the horne museum in florence shows her leaving   uhm now it it's typically  italian renaissance in the grace uhm the beauty the elegance of the form uhm the way she's seen approaching the castle but hesitant about it because she doesn't know what's gonna going to  happen and what she's getting into  and the hesi hesitance is indicated by the way her foot is dragging and the way her dress is sort of dragging not coming along  and this is echoed by the tree here  the shape of the tree you see it has the same graceful shape the same lines as she has with a little bit of that  that suggests here the shrubberies here  this is is it was one of the first uses of landscape in the picture  it's called supportive landsch landscape   and it supported the main figure  so you see esther coming up in this very elegant fashion  to uh the the and and and   the colours and and the rendition uh that was typically renaissance  the other one is mordecai  this was a groom's chest  and this tells another story  mordecai on the first panel comes to esther and tells her that the king has issued an edict saying that all jews will be put to death  and she is jewish but the king does not know it which seems to me to be a peculiar part of the story but anyway  uhm this is in the book of esther   uh he says to her come and talk to him and see if you can talk him out of this  it's as much as her life is worth to go into the presence of the king without being summoned and so she hesitates  she doesn't know what to do but in the end she decides that she must risk her own life to try to free her people  she goes  uhm and that is the large one uh sh  showing her coming into the presence of the king  she talks the king out of his edict  and this is the final one where you see mordecai coming out of the castle and the horse is being led by haman who is the man who  proposed the edict in the first place and he's now reduced to the  word of the groom and leading mordecai's horse  mordecai is victoried victorious   the horse is prancing  it it almost seems to me as though the horse is laughing   uhm so these these uhm this is these are  the stories  this is the kind of art that was being done at that time  and uhm it it gives us another idea  of of art and what art was used for when we you know when you can see a cassone chest and know   that uh that that was used uhm to uh  to uh decorate the chests
