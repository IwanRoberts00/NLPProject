 no i'm  i i i i have a problem with seriously limiting to towards either sex or age or anything  anyone can use this  ya  and and   but it doesn't say seniors   seniors on it   ya   and nor should it  no   anyone  even let's say a twelve year old girl a thirteen year old girl who's just starting to bank   yup  you know uh babysitting and opened up her own account and  you know   yup you're right  oh news eh pulse tonight six o'clock mike i think  the jen hawes thing   oh ya  ya   they called him up  no but they've had uhm  it's a three part special on women's safety and they had two parts already   that's good  so it should be on tonight  he probably forgot sniff   call him up later  word   cough   so well that's good  that's not a lot  and maricourt isn't far sniff   no it isn't   it's just the other way  ya  it's right off the highway  that's what i like about it   seems we often go there for meetings  people are not happy about this christmas vacation eh  who  amelie and paul   why  very angry  cos they don't get a full two weeks  yup  they get nine days instead of ten   rian atoul told me  she said uh oh you know we got ten days last week  last year sniff and said you know if you speak to  gerald it doesn't you know   ya but where's  i don't know  i i never even looked at it  i'm coming in with mike here because this is john's  birthday so uhm   and and i'm not  coming in on the thrid cos it's my birthday  i   i don't know what the big deal is   that's right   but you can't finish here   i think it it's   word   that's what i was saying at the meeting  not if this office is op  open not if the whole building is open   that's what i was saying at the meet  meeting   did you find out when the when the   uh city closes  cough   no   but head office now i think they're closed here and here type thing  not a lot  i mean someone's upstairs   i mean they should close right after  they don't open as soon   no  that's the thing  last summer it was uh   cos the second is a holiday  remember last year what we did is we took   we stayed in the office two days after  c&ocircumflex;te-des-neiges montreal neighbourhood had left  because we had to take two days coming back  mm hmm   but i don't see what the problem is cos you get the  i i'll get this day back  ya   one two three four five six seven eight nine ten  no  one two three four five six seven eight nine  the the second is closed eh  ya  big deal  and you're taking the third   so i'm gonna going to  word in here   you know what i'm gonna going to be doing  mm hmm  nobody's gonna going to be working working  no  you just tend the office  that's it   so what's the big deal  i mean john and mike are coming  you think they're going to be working  no  they'll be playing the computer   they're going to be playing on the computer  i'll probably be cleaning laugh if it's not already done  ya   ya  it's a pain to do all that  but it's just to answer the phones  that's all  i know  that's  you know check the mail  i know   mail still runs   head office closes here  so word   oh   amelie asked of course cos mel  showed up at ashland and one of the first questions out of her mouth was when do you finish for uh christmas  he said twenty-second  she said oh   so  but uh they  see the thing is they live for their holidays  i know   uhm i mean i feel bad for them  yes  it's terrible to live your life between vacations  yes  but sometimes people gotta got to  work  gerald actually has put his foot down on this issue too  cos i guess he's uh realizing that   so who's attending the office there  uhm jacqueline   oh i have it here   okay twenty-first it's amelie but i think jackie  is going in too with her   ya cos they have to be two  ya but they said it wasn't working out that way  but anyway sniff   jacqueline is gonna going to  go in with amelie on the twenty-first  and then you and mike here   twenty-second jacqueline is gonna going to be all by herself so i might go in there   john and mike here  and the third gerald and ja   jack gerald and jack     and rian and i here the third  cos jack will be in richmond too  and and i mean i'll probably stop in anyway   yup  when you're two minutes away it's really no big deal   so   you can do like last year   clear off your desk and make sure that there's enough room to pile some more on it   laugh that's right  that's what i did last year  laugh you came in last year over the christmas holidays  do you remember   ya  you were here almost every day  i didn't want to be home  i know  so this year is a little different  ya  i like to lead and i'm gonna   going to decorate my house for christmas   it's gonna going to be a hard christmas for you guys  i know   i might just wanna want to  decorate  but you're at home blessing and that's   ferlix   i know   a lot of people don't decorate you know the first year  we need at least a christmas tree  i'm not  oh i mean   ya   the thing is the   if you're all adults maybe but you have   a a little guy   ya but it was my dad's joy to put the lights outside and to have it out  you know he left the lights on all night christmas day and you know  like it was something that he really enjoyed  ya   it's gonna going to be hard because he used to sit down and be like the santa claus get out the gifts and  one by one  hm   that's what jim was thinking about doing  i said well   then you gotta got to do it for him   ya  that's exactly it  i know   traditions have to continue   then you got a little guy who's probably waiting for santa claus as we speak  oh ya   commercials are starting   ya well did you go into the store lately  no  it's all decorated word   as soon as halloween is over   it's too early  as soon as halloween's over well christmas decorations go up   word   so i guess he's making his list and checking it twice  yup  i already bought him something  did you  ya  the monster food factory  laugh mmm  they eat uhm monster skin and all that  oh pleasant   you make you make uh you make stuff and you eat it  lovely   it looks really disgusting  mm hmm  that's what he wanted   so we don't have a lot in december right  i mean we'll try not to schedule anything  well   unless it's an emergency   listen my only problem is that when i start off a month it's usually blank or i get like the first weeks filled out and it fills out as i go  ya  i'm going to have to be vigilant with myself and say no  no is no you know   ya   now thing is mike has to be like that too because mike will book me everywhere  we all do   i mean it doesn't  i'll tell you now about the block captain meeting  uh   it doesn't matter  things can wait til until january  people aren't in that much of a hurry  i hope  and saint declan's is the sixth they said  ya   and then if a few words that's okay  ya   i don't know why  oh shoot   sniff   i just ruined this  why amelie and john are so uhm upset about the holidays  all they have to do is accumulate seven hours and take their ten days  yup   it's not a word   i mean that last week when we're coming in for those three days  you think we're going to be working working  exactly  one half a day's gone  we're going to the restaurant  yup   i'm going to be doing my regular cleaning or   sniff but if we want to paint the office we have to put some time aside   if we hopefully if we can get all that done maybe we can take the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth and clean  what do you think   i think that would be a great good idea  kay okay   we really have to start uhm on the fifth  ya  and nothing word booked   word that week word  sniff   i mean if you book anything you book it at night and a few words   are we going to empty the offices   i think we should just for uhm the uhm phones and  word   then again unless she has not uhm   amelie won't be sitting on these  she could uh   or they can transfer calls  we could transfer   i mean we could be based out of the other office  i don't care  yup   okay fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth of december cleaning   cleaning and painting  ya   sounds good   cough   so the week of the fifth to the tenth is evaluation   what about the s nineteenth twentieth meetings  nineteen and twen twentieth   uhm the twentieth is a write off  the twentieth well we're gonna going to  be coming in and finishing up whatever our hours our kilometres our end of month  ya   it's probably going to be a lot of end of month  ya  but there won't be much  no   on the nineteenth we're probably going to be  be putting back furniture  ya   so   so that just cut down our evaluation in one week  one week and  no   no  but   well then we could start on the first which is the thursday friday   well we have the twelfth and the thirteenth too   there's always word  weeks   ya   and what if we're not finished   the sixteenth or the evaluation  no the evaluation   we have to be   we cos we could let that drag on forever  we really have to put an opening time and a closing time  what if we tell them though that we're painting the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth  they wanna want to clean too   okay so put three days for cleaning  that that might  well he can't say anything for us  we're painting his office  we gotta got to find colours though  ya cough   we gotta got to find uh   we should uh start keeping uh newspapers   it's uhh almost twelve  still rolling  is it  ya   so   what time did we start our meeting at  i have no idea  oh  she'll come in  laugh sniff   we left her two hours i said   laugh   so that's what you think an evaluation form   yup  with just notes on it what to consider in it because some  some people might write uh a page and a half on the   outcome and only uh a quarter of a page on uh  on something else you know  mm   because this takes time   ya   you have to sit down and think and write it out  that's it  that's why i won't   monday and tuesday the  bell starts tolling thursday and friday the first that's what i'm gonna going to do  i'm putting everything inside and that's what i'm gonna  going to do  okay   i i mean i i'm gonna going to i'm gonna   going to start them as soon as i have them   but i'm gonna going to finalize them all then   ya   ya you have to make sure that mike stays with the schedule  he has to   let's hope he doesn't have anything   oh   if he does he doesn't know about them at this point   so so preparation a couple lines for that  what would you write for preparation for autograph   uhm everything that you need  like i mean what would what would you   consider as preparation  let's do autograph you know quickly  uh okay are we holding it or are  are we holding it by our self  at this point with lacombe lamonde   first thing is to contact lacombe lamonde   to set up a date  two word   uhm ask him/-> well we usually ask him  where are they gonna going to publicize  maybe three words   mm hmm  then you call them back tell them which date you're having it  bell tolling continues
