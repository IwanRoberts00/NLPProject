 good  to ge that way we can get a good   we can get someone who's selling it and who's using it that way make all these other people a whole lot simpler that i go to  i can say well just get in touch with this person you know they're one of our resellers see what they think of it   but those other people i don't think i don't think    i think rory 'll go for it cough like i have to talk to the guy but i think they'll uh they'll uh   go for it speaker b reads job description aloud   so that's uh you know it sounds it sounds  really cool  just a question of getting the appropriate cover letter  good  yep and getting one to benjamin and getting one to the y for computer things  laugh   and uh this guy john who i who i  met today wants to take and get involved with uh large companies  in the i in exchange of uh   of data you know from like the l  the main office to the little small subsidiary and getting all the relevant product information and everything like that so i dunno   don't know   i'm not quite familiar with what he's talking about right now but we're going to be meeting about it next week so  huh  so it could be pretty cool we'll have to see about that  i wish pedro would finish up his pharmafree thing  i got a bunch of stuff for him to do  actually   laugh   actually i wonder if it's worthwhile i mean like i know all these people want programs done and everything like t   like i know three people right now that need programmers to do things for them  i wonder if it's worthwhile like advertising and finding you know programmers  cos remember we tried that up at the club tryin  trying to find programmers and everything and it was like pulling teeth  laugh   trying to find anyone who was good  i mean most of the people who are good are employed   course of course   s so i wonder if maybe it's worthwhile getting in touch with pedro 's the people he knows in his class and finding out like okay how much time do you have outside of  cos i know pedro 's got a project but i'm sure marc  's not doing anything outside of what he's doing at work   and pedro 's got some other friends that i don't think at least what he what he you know from what he   tells me i don't think they're involved in other projects   maybe i should try and you know tap that resource a bit  it's worth a try  yeah long pause, about eight - nine seconds   okay  so what are you doing i hear some tapping  sorry it's my calculator  oh okay  have you figured out how to use that big old   but it's there's no like you can't  go outside because there's nothing there's no  stairs or anything  okay  it used to be a fire exit  laugh   and he got caught in the screen door in there  okay  so it was fine cos he was like dying  but somehow he got out probably the same way he got in  audible inhale   and now he's buzzin buzzing  around like a little fly laugh   yeah he's gonna going to you know land on your food and lay eggs and before you know it you'll have lots of them   no because all my food is put away very well  mkay okay   so and i don't uh the only food i have  in my room is uhm like canned stuff  mm hmm  and stuff in my fridge  mkay okay   and it's all in little baggies and stuff cos  i just have like a fetish about  ahh   laugh   three words   you have a fetish about plastic things i see laugh    no laugh plastic things  about food being out in the open i hate that  laugh   cos i think about bugs all the time landing on it and  blech  laugh   freaks me out   so   and i have done absolutely no studying tonight  oh no well  no cos after i got off the phone with you then mandy  called me then carol called me then my sister called me  mm   so i haven't accomplished very much  laugh   except half of a grocery list  well you know that's you know you're   doing the important things first right laugh   that's right food first  sniff i know what you mean  uhh i tried to study but it doesn't work  ah i hate it laugh i said to   you have that exam tomorrow eh  yeah but the exam tomorrow is it's  neuropsychology  it's uhm it's to do with brain cells  and stuff like that nerve neurons and stuff  the thing is i've already i've done that  in most of my other biology classes and stuff like that breath    mm hmm   so all i have to do is really read the book and it's  i think it's thirty questions multiple choice  it's you know psych is not   ts not that's could be it's not that bad  it's not the hardest subject and  no i have social social psych and i really like it's my favourite class  mm hmm yeah   and seeing as i've you know i've already  done most of the stuff in other classes it's not hard  i know most of it already before the teacher even brought it up he says well now we're gonna going to talk about action potential breath   and i'm thinking okay i've already taken you know four courses on this or whatever and one of them was actually so in depth that you know everybody was lost by the second class  so it's nothing new nothing seriously hard what can i do  well that's good  yeah my roommate called and said alright we're gonna  going to go out i'm like okay sure you know laugh   so you're gonna going to go out tonight  well i sort of decided that you know noisy sigh what the hell why not  i was gonna going to ex   use this as an excuse to stay home and study but seeing as i'm not gonna going to study anyway i might as well go out breath   and since it's my birthday people are gonna going to buy me free beer or you know how you can get free beer  what time is your exam at tomorrow  it's uh one fifteen  oh that's not bad  i have class from eleven forty-five till one though   yeah still not bad though  and i can also skip it though so laugh   exactly   yeah no big deal  we'll see what happens laugh   see what time i wake up tomorrow  i'm certainly not gonna going to get drunk tonight sniff   what  i s i'm certainly not   gonna going to get drunk tonight  no i'm not planning on getting drunk till after my birthday so  but   ahh well it's coming up isn't it  well in november  mm hmm fourteenth right  yeah again  laugh   i have a memory for numbers  except your telephone number i had trouble two words  sigh   where did y w did you   remember it  no  i was gonna going to say holy  shit   no first of all i was thinking look for a telephone bill it might be on there and all of a sudden no no no that telephone bill hasn't come in yet laugh you know  and all of a sudden wait a minute w how  can i get  so i called the operator the six one three operator and got your number  oh really  yeah  oh you shoulda should have waited a little while cos i woulda would have called you back  inhale yeah well i didn't know if you'd get annoyed at me or angry or whatever because laugh   i figured that had happened  and uh my landlady's uh phone rang  mkay okay   and i thought hmm i wonder if that's damon cos you had my old number  mkay okay   and i wondered if you would phone my old number cos you couldn't find my new one   but i didn't wanna want to answer her phone because   i didn't have your old number  you didn't  no  oh yeah i think you did  why how long has it been since you had this number  well since like oh maybe you didn't   since september no you probably didn't have my old number  no no but i guess you gave me the address and you said when i get my new phone number i'll call you laugh okay  yeah   alrighty then  laugh   uhm guess how much my phone bill was speaking of phone bills  how much  just try and guess  eighty-five  put a one in front of that and you got it  are

something  yeah because when you call you talk to me for two minutes and then i called you back laugh   no that was that that one hasn't  come up yet cos that was just a little while ago  oh boy laugh   yeah so you're gonna going to get a doozer of a pho phone bill  seriously   i can imagine   but that's a lot of money  yes it is  that's almost three hundred bucks  so i told my mom she called me
