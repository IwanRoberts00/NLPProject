it's it's kind of like along the lines of my feminist joke laugh   laugh   anyways zac zac  assured me that jewish people laughed their heads off  laugh   laugh well  oh i saw this book the other day  i i hadn't uhm   laugh   one of my ex-boyfriends had it  and i loved this book  it was the encyclopedia of jewish humour  and it's all classified and themed  it's got family women rabbis and stuff and they're really really funny stories  laugh   uhm i'll try to remember one one   this guy this jewish guy owns a fish market and he's   he has a sign over his door saying fresh fish sold daily  and this guy he comes along and says oi why do you write uh  fresh fish why do you whi  write fresh   you know everybody knows   like if it isn't fresh we wouldn't come here would we    so he has the fresh barred out  you know he paints over the fresh and so now it's fish fish sold daily  and he says oi why do have the uh the  daily   you know we know you sell it daily   we come here everyday   so the guy says oh not a bad idea   so he bars out the daily   uh fresh fish sold   uh well of course we know it's sold   we don't get it for free man   like you know like why do you write that   so he bars it out and and there's only  fish left  and uhh and so he says now is it okay   why do you write fish   we smell it a block away   laugh i don't know  these stupid little jokes  they're really cute   laugh   i had this fascination with judaism for a while   there was uhm   i was re really struggling with a god issue  i stumbled upon this book at one point  it was seven questions most often asked to jews  and the first one was do you have to believe in god to be a good jew  and and the answer  these guys i guess who wrote the book were p h ds and stuff like that and uh   a and they said that no you don't have to believe in god to be a good jew and actually the doubt  is is a healthy thing  uhm you have to to doubt everything in life  and in in practising uhm in  in following certain rules certain laws you know you will be brought to uhm to believe in uh a higher power of sorts in time  uhm i thought that was kinda kind of  interesting  i thought that was easy  laugh   okay cool i don't have to believe in god and i can be spiritual   laugh that's good  laugh okay   christian just did this course in in uhm   in jewish mysticism that he really liked  or jewish i guess it was jewish mysticism   like kabbalah  ya obviously  alright  anyways i was just at uhm i was up on on a in ah was waiting to come up to uhm on the friday   i was waiting i was killing time so i went down mount royal and i went into a used a a   junk shop and there was a bunch of trophies there and i decided well you know i'll look at what was one  what one was for  uh huh   and it was for some i can't remember  i wish i could remember what it exactly said  but it was you know for some jewish public school  and it was the annual trophy for the best for the student with the highest marks in jewish spirituality   laugh class   laugh   and i was going to buy it laugh and give it to chris laugh cos he liked that course so much  laugh wow   but then i was oh i don't know how much it would cost  probably would have only been about three four dollars  laugh   but i just thought it'd be so funny  he could stick it on his mantlepiece says " mantlepliece"   laugh   wow   uhm james ling high school or something  it wasn't but it was you know some obviously real  plateau school from the from the  fifties or something  ya ya ya   i didn't look at the dates  one of those st st urban schools  ya  you know i should've checked huh  maybe i would've recognized some of the names laugh   did you get trophies and little ribbons in school   for   oh well i didn't laugh   no   no  the school i went to didn't have  they used they used  to have uhm they used to have   an annual uh uh   ah uh field day laugh uh   cos we didn't have them   no   laugh   which was just torture   laugh   i hated it cos they used to pen us up outside in the middle of the thing and you had to be there all d  day you know  it was right at the end of school when nobody wanted to be there  at all   uh huh   teachers students nobody  and i'd have to go out and do organized athletics  laugh and then then they then and in the schoolyards   yuck laugh   so we'd have this they'd have this  fenced off area  and if you weren't actually competing  i mean i think the idea was incentive to compete  right compete   cos if you didn't sign up for things you'd sat there in the sun  i mean nowadays everyone would scream about shade but back then nobody cared  they didn't even  i mean they didn't even fence off the area under the trees or half under the trees  it was just  anyways  i know those were brutal  they were the geeks' worst nightmare  you know after   i used to hate this watch   laugh   i was always the last to be picked for anything  laugh in sports  oh ya   so they handed out ri ribbons  for those  in the lower grade they used to arrange it so that everyone got a ribbon   okay laugh   like there'd be some kind of a team event team event where the whole group would be like you know like every class would be divided into three teams and there'd be first second and third ribbons or something laugh   whoa  but later on it was just on  i mean after a while  but in the higher grades it was run by the jocks  and uhm our school went up to grade eight  pretty soon after a while i learned that you didn't have to go to school laugh   so i just wouldn't go in those days  you know it's like i could see a play day coming and i didn't laugh a field day coming and i   just wouldn't go to class  i hated them   you know like anyone was really gonna  going to get upset you know laugh   i was also since i was six i was really sensitive to the sun and my mother had this thing  she wanted me to look healthy so i had to go lie   i i i had to go   lay out in the backyard in the sun  i'd be dying and i'd cry  i was oh my god no  uhh uhh   and she'd be pinching my cheeks and uhh  it was just n  nightmare a nightmare   laugh   laugh it was awful  she always wanted me to look cute  this i hated when i was a kid  she'd when i was i guess around eight nine ten years old she'd kinda kind of   curl my hair on the bottom  make these little boudains   and uh i just hated having to two or three words   you have really fine hair too   does it does it does it take a curl  ya ya it does  but you know geeky  i was already such a geek  you know i really didn't need that laugh   laugh   uh  ya i i went up i put up with a lot of grief cos of my name   it's uh my mother's theory was that   what's your name  steven   and uh  oh for that  ya   for steven   ya  you got grief   ya  like my first name is actually gerald uh but  after my uncle uh the doctor  and uhm but i i didn't use that name because i didn't like ger or gerry or all those other diminutives  so they decided that they was going  they'd they'd pick a name for me not for any relative for my second name that was just gonna  going to have no diminutives   uh huh   so they chose steven you know  and so i went through life as you know steve and virginie   steven segal even steven   steven the vegan uhh   even steven   laugh   about a million of them  and uhh i mean i mean i had a friend whose name was jenny and she pointed out you know if the kids are  gonna going to hate you they're gonna   going to hate you anyways laugh   uh huh   and she had a perfectly normal name  they find ways  my name was sajak   but uh   i'd be known as kojak laugh   things like that  i hated it  laugh   i detested my name as a child  i hated being different because people said that  oh kids were mean  they said europeans don't wash laugh and things like that  i just hated the whole culture when i was a kid  oh ya   well i mean i was i was a wasp  in a in a neighbourhood of wasps  that made no difference   laugh very little difference anyways   i mean the only the only the  the only essential difference in my family and everybody else's was that uh my parents were freelance writers and had no money  laugh   uh huh  you jnow and then the neighbourhood i grew up in everyone was a v p  okay  a v p of a large corporation   not quite  i mean there weren't presidents there but they were all all you know management  was that a problem growing up for you  sure   i mean that's where i ended up with my attitude  uh huh  and uh laugh you know and uh ya  i find my ahm my mother comes from  a small town in new bruns brunswick  in new brunswick from uhm a farming family  and they were very poor  that have holes in their boots  had to walk to school several miles and stuff  i find what happens with these people is that they   they don't become quite as judgmental as other pe  people   since they've been picked on a lot you know  they're more uhm tolerant  right   and it's in the end nicer people in a way because they've had it a little rough you know
