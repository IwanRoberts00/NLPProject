 i mean if you hit it three quarters and drive it back on  th the those rocks at the back then you're in a lot of trouble  and that's just super control   heidi true to form though is going after it  uhm you know she started this whole end by freezing and uh this is her game plan  this is the way she likes to play it   so new brunswick now lies one   sheri stewart with a nose hit on that stone  okay for b c don they want to hit this rock and roll over into this area here because the way the rocks are sitting now there's a definite pocket for uh new brunswick to freeze to   so they want to get a little bit of movement to this shooting rock of jodie here  they want to roll it away so that there's not a pocket that new brunswick can draw down to   oy   if there's one thing you couldn't do on that out-turn side because it is so unbelievably straight is be that hair wide because it's not going to come back   it's amazing how quickly the whole complexion of the end can change though isn't it   you know that's one advantage of uh   that's a good call heidi  you don't wanna want to be going in around that uh top red one because you may set up a double  do you like the situation as a skip where you ask your third  what shot to play  no way   no way  i mean i like a skip to suggest a shot maybe but never to insist on where they wanna want to play it  you mean a third  a third right   i mean you're the skip you're planning the whole strategy for your last rock whether you wanna want to play the in-turn the out-turn or a draw or a hit so you plan the whole end so why are you asking your third where you want it to put to put it    well kathy floyd did not put that one exactly where heidi hanlon called for   shot stone however still belongs to new brunswick  there is a chance here for jodie sutton if she hits it very very thin she could maybe come off her own and get in for shot rock  hit it very very thin but she's gonna going to  hit it fairly full on the nose  so new brunswick still lies one   well i think if i was heidi hanlon you wanna   want to split the house again i s definitely might go in here  the danger of where she's putting it don in here that if she puts it right there there's a chance for maybe uhm british columbia to make it doubles so she's doing a bit of a gambling here by putting it on that side   if she doesn't put it in perfect and b c makes the double b c is lying three   now she's going to get a rock and a real break  laugh   aw no kidding  that's a good break for her but the bad part is that she's kind of set up a double there a raised back double mind you but there's still an opportunity   now is there any reason she would chose the in-turn rather than the out-turn  no i think she feels more comfortable in the in-turn  because she you heard her l last remarks say it will come up in the end and that's what she wants  but the one thing that she did say is that listen if i just run it off i can always come down with my next shot to those two so she's always playing maybe uh the next shot as well   the in-turn will st still just stay straight whereas the out-turn there will f have a tendency to float back   if they holler yes you know that it's   gonna going to s start to move  she got just one stone but she also opened things up  well that was the idea but if she can make the perfect shot the raised double keel but as long as she made the tat  raised-back and at least got one of them   this will be a remark about the ice that heidi's taking here  that it is well over on the edge of the four play and once you get over that far don that rock is liable to run very very straight as opposed to taking ice closer to the centre line where it will curl   i would not be surprised depending on if heidi hits the broom here uh that this rock stays well in the open and not buried around that corner guard   she let it go uh quite a bit inside the broom i thought   she's almost at the centre line now   it hung on at the back to become second shot   so new brunswick lies two   okay for julie sut sutton  you know interesting enough she's playing the out-turn now on this takeout but the key for julie here is that she wants to hit get  a little action on her shooter over into this area here behind  this corner this uh guard that's at the top of the twelve foot  there is a chance for a double   but you have to be so exacting w to call the rock that you're making contact with   jodie sutton's gonna going to have to watch this rock very very closely coming down the ice to make sure number one that she hits the rock number two that she gets a half of it  enough to get in behind that guard or make the double   she didn't get the roll and now that rock is fully exposed  and there's an opportunity for heidi hanlon with her final stone at this third end to hit and stick and pick up a pair and take the lead  well you know she at the very beginning of this end she decided to gamble and freeze to try and score two points  here she is she has a wide open hit  to score twos so her strategy played off  shot not unlike the one she played last night to win the semi-final against heather houston of thunder bay  oh she's st   that rock's got a lot of curling to do now it's starting to be a  bit of a move  is she gonna going to hang around for two   no   she's only gonna going to score one   so the shooter rolls out of play  the result is a single point for new brunswick on the third end  and after one en or three ends of play this game between new brunswick and british columbia is tied at one general sports wrap-up tv advertisements   welcome back to saskatchewan place in saskatoon  i'm don whittman along with don duguid and colleen jones  you're watching fourth end action in the scott tournament of hearts championship game involving heidi hanlon of new brunswick and  julie sutton of british columbia  this game is tied at a point a piece   b c scoring one in the first the second end was blanked and new brunswick picking up a single point on end three   sherri stewart the second stone for new brunswick is just a wonderful wonderful pillar but for years we've been wondering if she ever does talk  she's very quiet and shy but boy can she curl   she's an experienced competitor  a junior provincial champion in new brunswick in nineteen eighty-three and nineteen eighty-four  she won a provincial women's championship in nineteen eighty-six with grace donald  and of course has competed with heidi hanlon in nineteen eighty-nine ninety and ninety-one at the tournament of hearts   julie sutton indicating to melissa soligo just how far in front of the rings that yellow-handled stone is  well i think maybe uhm julie sutton might look at playing the out-turn as opposed to the in-turn  she's got a lot of room on the right hand side  she can miss that long guard by a foot foot and a half and maybe end up buried  the rock that she's trying to go around belonging to new brunswick is only about a foot in front of the house don so she has to just go by it by a very thin margin to be buried  unfortunately don it again comes down to ice conditions dictating the way you have to play  it won't bend so much on the out-turn and she would've just been in the open as she is going to be anyhow  but uhm coming down on the out-turn around that high corner guard she it won't bury but the in-turn tends to bury better   well if heidi hanlon gets a little bit of a hit and roll on this one to the right-hand side she's gonna going to   be forced to play the out-turn  and i think once you get inside the centre colleen and coming over that hog-line into the house i think it'll move a bit  well it sure didn't for me but i didn't have much luck here this week laugh   laugh   a nose hit  new brunswick lies one   five and six colleen was your record  you got off to a great start winning your first three  what happened over the balance of the week  well one thing that happens now in canadian championships is you have pre-determined last rocks and and uhm   we had we went our first three straight games with wins then the next four games we didn't have the advantage of last rock and we lost all four  and women's curling has improved so much it can come down to who has last rock and we did lose all those games in the tenth or extra ends  competition this is the best scott tournament of hearts field that they've ever had too  the competition is fantastic  b c lies one as that stone delivered by melissa soligo  hangs on for a bite of the twelve  but she has her family here from trail british columbia watching the action   melissa soligo has one bad knee that gives her a little bit of problems from time to time  after she competed in kelowna two years ago she went in for an operation on it and that pretty much tied her up for all of last curling season but she's come back so strongly this year from it all   will kathy floyd make contact with that stone   yes   she never layed a brush to it all the way down the ice though you know how straight it runs there  as soon as kathy floyd let it go heidi hanlon said whoa   you're she's a little bit on the outside  now we'll see whether julie sutton perseveres and plays the in-turn and that's exactly what she's doing   that's   jodie sutton after she won the canadian junior championship a few years ago spent the following year in thailand so took a year off  not much curling over there  laugh exactly but she said it was a marvellous experience   the b c front end has sweeping drills that they practice all year long  they spend thirty minutes working on their sweeping  sweeping down the ice for twenty seconds taking a break for thirty seconds sweeping again for twenty seconds and they do that for a half hour  their sweeping is very strong  well if they want some extra practice i've got an extra long driveway at home they can work on   i've seen that driveway too  i'm not sure that they could handle that one laugh   laugh   b c lies one   it's very very deep in the back twelve foot  the danger here of course is that heidi hanlon uh can ask kathy floyd to come down and hopefully bury behind the guard and keep it in front of the tee-line and if she's a little bit heavy she'll slip and freeze to the line at the back  what she thrown here is a little more than back line  oh yeah   she has a lot of weight   oh and it just hangs on at the back   she nudged the red b c stone out of there and the shooter  hangs for a bite of the twelve foot
