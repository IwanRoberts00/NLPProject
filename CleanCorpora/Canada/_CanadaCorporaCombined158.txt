 it subsidizes the cost of shipping perishable nutritious foods to isolated northern communities and puts these basic necessities within the reach of northern families  and uh on many of the flights that i have taken to various places in the north i'm aware that the the plane is in many cases filled with bread eggs milk and other perishables that are shipped to these communities  however even with the assistance of this program it's extremely difficult for families to afford the proper and nutritious uh food that is demanded and without the program it would be virtually impossible to do so  and i again stress the list of prices that the honourable member uh listed  they are not exaggerated  and i'm not exaggerating when i say the situation in the north would be desperate without this uh without this program  government studies show that a family of four in isolated communities in the northwest territories would have to spend between two hundred and sixty to two hundred and eighty dollars a week or between eighty-five and a hundred and ten per cent of their after-shelter income for a basic diet  that's about twice the cost of a comparable basic diet here in southern canada  i'd remind honourable members that canada is a signatory to the united nations declaration on the rights of the child and one of those rights is the right to adequate nutrition  children should not go hungry especially in our country madam speaker  so there can be no question in my estimation as to the need for the program  the only question is what form the government subsidation for food distribution subsidization for food distribution  or food costs should be  ah we stress that it is essential for the health of northern residents  i think it's also fair to say that the current program is achieving its intended purpose notwithstanding the suggestions made by the honourable member  the northern food mail program is strongly supported by the communities it serves and by the food distribution companies the merchants which form part of the distribu  distribution system and of course consumers  canada post which ships food products and other essential goods by air has been a willing and vital partner in the program   in spite of all that i commend the honourable member for saint-jean for urging the government to reconsider the current northern food distribution system  there's always room for improvement and governments should be continually looking at new approaches to program delivery  i'm therefore extremely pleased to inform the house that the government has already taken steps to re-evaluate this program  in april the minister of indian affairs and northern development  and the minister of health committed their departments to a full review of this essential service for the next year   this review will build on an evaluation of the program that was undertaken by consultants last year  it will include consultations with all the key stakeholders including northern residents merchants air carriers provincial and territorial governments and aboriginal organizations  madam speaker this consultation process is fully in keeping with the red book liberal party platform commitment and i know the honourable member has read the red book extensively to ensure that aboriginal people are fully involved in decisions that affect their lives  toward this end regional consultation meetings will be held in the north this september and october  written views and recommendations will also be accepted by the government   my honourable colleague will be particularly pleased to hear that an interdepartmental committee is currently looking at terms of reference to guide this review  in addition to health canada and indian and northern affairs canada the committee has representations from the departments of finance agriculture and human resources development the treasury board and the privy council office  madam speaker this review will look at the issue of food distribution in the north from a very broad puss perspective    it will not just consider how much money is being spent or needs to be spent under the northern food mail program  it will address the fundamental question of whether or not this is the best way to ensure that northerners can meet their needs for food and other essential goods that are currently shipped under the program  it will review alternatives for food distribution and food costs subsidization including income support to ensure that people have money to buy the essential foods  the role of local food production processing and inter-settlement trade will also be considered  the review may in the end tell us that the essential structure of the program is solid but that some fine tuning is needed  it may tell us that a completely new approach is needed or that the program should be developed uh and and looked after by another level of government or indeed by an independent organization  in the meantime madam speaker honourable members have the government's assurance that funding for the program in its current format will continue  in nineteen ninety-four and ninety-five a total of fourteen point one million dollars will be available for the food mail program  the bulk of this some thirteen point six million dollars will come from the department of indian affairs and northern development  the remaining five hundred thousand dollars will be det  contributed by health canada  this level of funding should be sufficient to maintain the postage rates at the current levels until march thirty-first nineteen ninety-five  in in conclusion madam speaker i want to say that i of course am not an expert on this subject  i've had some experience as i have indicated in the course of my remarks but i'm not an expert and the remarks that i am alluding to and that i am s in part reading have been prepared for the parliamentary secretary to the minister of indian affairs and northern development who is tied up in a committee tonight and is u and is unable to be here in the house to deliver this particular speech  so i'm pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the speech really on his behalf and contribute to the debate on behalf of the uh government  and i i would like to say in conclusion that this house must acknowledge that the northern food mail program has proven to be an effective and efficient way of making food and other essential goods more affordable in in  isolated northern communities  as a member who travels there occasionally i am pleased to support it  and i'm confident that if any improvements can be made either in the short term or in the long term they will be identified in the course of the review that the government is has under way at the moment and which will be reporting in due course  i thank the honourable member for raising this issue in the house  applause   the honourable member for wetaskiwin   thank you madam speaker   i'm uh pleased to be able to participate in this debate uh on the motion presented by my honourable colleague the member from saint-jean  the motion before us today uh asks the government to make food distribution in canada's more uh north more effective and uh more economical  and i i couldn't help but notice that uh the uh member who spoke just before me must've  we must have been doing research from exactly the same uh material madam speaker because uh his speech sounded an awful lot like the one that i'm about to deliver   we in the reform party are always looking for ways to improve on existing programs  and and i'd like to commend the honourable member for his initiative in bringing this motion uh forward   since the nineteen sixties the federal government in conjunction with the uhm post office has made an effort to supply uh   n northern isolated northern  communities with affordable fresh produce  under the northern air stage program the department of indian and northern affairs department of indian affairs and northern development pays canada post a subsidy to cover a portion of the cost of bringing nutritious mostly perishable food to communities that have no year round road or rail access   approximately a hundred and twenty-five communities serving about eighty-six thousand people are eligible under this program  as has been referred to here previously madam speaker the nineteen ninety-four fiscal year this food mail subsidy will amount to some fourteen point one million dollars  of this thirteen point six million will be coming from the department of indian and northern affairs with about a half a million dollars coming from the department of health   the residents of canada's north face not only higher retail prices than we southerners but uhm they also have a critical employment program   work is at best seasonal at nature in nature    most work that is in that area  in the nineteen nine eighty-six census showed that only thirty-five per cent of the aboriginal population fifteen years of age or older were employed compared to sixty per cent for all of canada in the same age category   so of course a high unemployment rate means a lower annual wage and  cough ultimately less purchasing power   the high cost of transporting goods in the north even with the government subsidized food mail program results in higher consumer prices  a family of four and uh also has been alluded to here earlier in these isolated communities in the in the northwest territories would have to spend between two hundred and sixty and two hundred and eighty dollars per week just for a basic diet  and uh uh it's at least twice as much as we would have to spend in southern canada for the same diet   a study by the department of indian and northern affairs canada conducted in nineteen ninety concluded that by reducing the merchant's transportation costs the air strategy subsidy has been an effective means of keeping the prices of food and other goods in remote areas lower than they otherwise would be   the study also found that an elimination of the subsidy would likely result in higher social assistance costs madam speaker higher health care costs and an increase in isolated post allowances for government employees   but madam speaker when the department of indian and northern affairs launched this study in nineteen ninety there were no uh apparent alternatives  today i believe that uh as was indicated by my honourable friend there may be a practical cost-effective solution for at least part of this problem  there is a cough   excuse me  there is a ah corporation madam speaker as was also alluded to by the mover of this motion that is prepared to establish a food distribution network  and uh certainly don't want to uh uh propose one corporation over another madam speaker but uh where there is one there's likely to be others  this corporation plans to subsidize or to supply food from a central distribution centre in iqaluit cough   i didn't say that right   uh which uh in the outset would serve uh   in in iqaluit which would at the outset serve some thirty-eight northern communities   this unique canadian enterprise predicts that the price of food products in the north could be reduced by ten to twenty per cent   this will be possible because of their plan to reduce transportation costs and because their purchasing power will enable them to negotiate lower prices and to pass the savings on to the customers   now this company expects to save on transportation costs by regrouping products and chartering aircraft that would carry up to seventy-five thousand dollars worth of merchandise per flight  while their plan initially is is to be a food wholesaler they estimate that they can receive eighty-eight per cent of the market share in two years by supplying perishable foods   uh food products and other consumer merchandise needed by northern residents but not currently available at reasonable prices   the overall cost to inaugurate the service is est   estimated to be some one million six hundred and fifty thousand dollars  and without going into too much of the of the   financing madam speaker it is safe to say that uh they would probably need some government uh loan guarantee in order to uhm get them started
