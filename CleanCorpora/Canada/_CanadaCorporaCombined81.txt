 well anyways that's what i was thinking about   about matt   maybe uh maybe he's just like due to slow down and and some metabolism thing is  changing him   if he just had more sleep he wouldn't have that glaze in his eyes and his   no but his skin  his his sk he's gotten very grey over the last year   very grey   mhh hmm  and he's got sandy coloured hair so it is   it isn't as drastic   no but it goes quick   like i remember my father  well i don't know if he'll go grey like daddy eh  he might go grey like mommy's brother   no he would be going bald then   two or three words   no he must be fournier cos he has all that hair  ya   well no i don't know who the  granger 's  remember   i don't know your other side of the family so  the men are bald and uhm   bald and   like more like mommy y'know you know   mhh hmm   so he must be like a fournier then because he's got such thick hair   as he's getting older it's ge  becoming much thinner   y'know you know   me i was gonna going to say i remember my father's hair turning grey  i mean i can remember as a young girl like say that like just grey here in this picture  and then i can remember like it was like sort of grey   and brow and black   and then it was   and then it   oops it's white   and i but i but i can remember the grey thing happening very quickly   so now i'm i know it's going to just happen laugh very quickly   laugh   so that's why it's probably happening so quickly on him  ya maybe  it's started  ya genetics   laugh   genetics here we go   oh ya genetically there's a lot of   like my dad   my dad was the oldest one to survive in his family  all his other s siblings  died at around fifty   he was the only one that managed to   oh and the one the one auntie that left me money last year laugh who died a couple of years ago  but all the others died very early   heart disease really really early forties fifties   ya  ya but they probably ate completely different than the way that you eat though   i have no idea  i didn't know them very well   so it would really freak you out if something happened to your sister then because   physically if something happened to your sister cos you would  thi   uh uh no not really because i think uh her personal  uh medical problems or whatever are are a lot to do with her own headspace ya  headspace   very much so  so   she worries so much it's beyond ridiculous  i mean uh uh i it's good   you know in the b in the beginning when they first came to when they were building our house i thought oh it's just like  she can't handle the construction site   or she doesn't believe that you're really gonna  going to be able to do it or something  but then other times she's come and like obviously everything's together y'know you know and she arrives on the scene and she's still carrying that kind of like inhale  like   ya   don't worry y'know you know you're not  gonna going to fall off any two by fours  like they're all put away now y'know you know  like  ya ya  no she's because she   worries about absolutely everything and to the extreme   and i'm i've still noticed it    so if anything if anything  makes her ill that's gonna going to be it   i mean there may be some hereditary y'know you know problems as well for sure but uh i'm sure that   she'll she'll edge them along very quickly by  her mindspace but  mhh hmm mhh hmm   well then i think that what we should do for christmas  circling back to that is that it should be a very laid back lack of pomp type of thing  mhh hmm  y'know you know   that'd be nice   i mean christmas since i've been living with  brian because of the business and everything it's like recovery time  and the first few years we tried to go up tape cuts out   it's like oh hi and then he's off  to go do something  ya   ya   i enjoyed the kids tonight   about three words when we're at his  house he's like he sits at the table for the dinner and then he he's the first one gone  we never see him  cos he cleans afterwards  no i'm talking about my father dear   oh your dad   about four words  and sleep in front of the t v words   that's right  you see you know what's good about it at least   you're trapped  you're trapped laugh   you can't like you could go to the other room where the kids were but uh it's colder in there  it's not as warm as here   i'm glad i didn't take apart that table too  oh that's the best table for the kids to paint on and stuff like that   i know  we shouldn't sell it now   ya it's true eh  ya   we should sell that thing right there  which thing  word   well i mean  is that what you were talking about when you were saying you don't like that  no uh they're of the two tables   i said i prefer this one not uh this one word  oh   i don't like  even now that it's finished i don't like it as much  i don't like it as much either  no it's kind of a word   but i do like it a lot  like a real lot  they didn't like that one compared to this one  really eh  ya  they don't know what to look for i guess   because   well no even phillip said that that was a   a nicer table as far as to sell like right now   yawn well i prefer that one ten times better  well that one's older  that's more my style  ya it's you know old and word    it's older  like you said i like the legs and i like the style   of it   its got the five legs  you know it looks antiquey  so they were impressed by my furniture store buying  eh  cos your cos your dad saw  what's the word   groan i can't believe he spent a year working on two words   no i know   he's exaggerating   ya  either that or he didn't have paint stripper laugh   word many years long   laugh ya laugh   it doesn't work  ya  no way  maybe it laugh   ya  uhm uh remember that movie  oh it was so scary   ya it is scary  i hate
