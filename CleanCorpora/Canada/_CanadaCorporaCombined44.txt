 there's there's a fair amount of   students   how much how much  did you make like on a regular night at the  bifteck ya  a night   at least sixty sixty bucks in tips  monday three words would be about  including your wages   well you get five dollars an hour basically so for  four about four or five hours twenty make about eighty dollars a night in four hours   that's not bad  four hours  you
