 i really think that would that's a bit naive   i'm just wondering about these people  well it's not so nai naive and you know i'm naive in the fact that uhm people who have been uhm  caught up in in the fast-pace demanding  uhm uhh frenetic lifestyle that they've that they've been  that they have been uh forced to live in or believed to feel there's important to live in for the last what two decades or  something to give them a four day work week and think that on that fifth day they're going to as you say get back into  volunteering and the board of something or other and dedicating their one day to that   i don't think that   mhhm   mhhm   it can't happen   well i don't think so because it's not part of their uhh it's it's not part of their raison d'etre i suppose  no   it's too bad because i agree with you  i thought it'd be wonderful you know go in to the hospital and seeing patients at at   dinner   oh i just i think words    mhhm   and i i'd love to do that  mhhm  i would love to do that  you know what i'd love to do i'd like to that too actually i'd like to do i i  saw a program on t v word that word  weekend and uhm we were watching the news and there  was what's that program that comes on just after the ten o'clock news and  the magazine or something and it was ah about this school called john stubbs   mhhm   the magazine   you heard of it  nope  well i think it's on hillside down near the   montre montreal westmont examiner    okay   and it's a school for autistic children  oh really  uhm they introduced words to the director of this school and she just seemed like uhm just a fireball  just wonderful  mhhm   and uh then there're just little scenes taken within the school uhm and there was uhm one session going on with these children when they were playing music and there were volunteers in there and they had the children that were moving with word   and ah uhm trying to instill in them an an  awareness of other sort of sensory uhm i don't know pleasures  and other things and uh  mhhm   right   look very closely on my pants  oh  isn't that beautiful  ya  words fat   look at how the lord has blessed us  they're so beautiful aren't they   they are  ya  uhm i don't know there it was it just grabbed me by the throat i said to morris write this i   i'm going to follow on monday and i'm going to volunteer on friday   i'm off on friday there's no reason why i can't  work a five day work week four days at  four days at concordia   and and one day there  mhhm   right   but see i haven't because i'm so relieved when friday comes to have a day to dedi   dedicate though to dedicate to chores and things   that i have to do here that i don't do it but it's an ins that's what i'd like to do  well that's it   exactly   oh god  i would love to do that  and i've known not words in me  words   no  i should just go one day and see you know if i had to go even a friday morning for two hours  what would that do out of my friday  nothing   right   it's once you make the commitment and you drop it out of into your life like i'm doing word  and word in in  june and i'm committed to that two those four tuesdays tuesday meetings or whatever  mhhm   and uh so i won't go into work  if they want me to work i'm i told them i'm not working  so you see word in the fact that  that obstacles in the way of us getting uh failing in   ourselves ourselves and word  job too because you know there are many conferences  for uhm e s l english as a second language teachers many of them a around the city and   and there's one interesting one going to take place between  concordia uh english language institute and community education  word institute uhm called university word  and then i began words the letter   uh that we received in our box there's uhm it's   the any other language school uh whether in canada or whether in our you know in our uhm sort of close to us  geographically uhm that teachers with sorry teachers with si similar   methods that we use   mhhm   right right   and so they're going to c  come ah ah meet and uhm meet and discuss and see if there's any possibility perhaps for exchange or observation hours or between the schools   mhhm   and i i and   they they said are you interested and i just put not at the present time  but when is  when is the time   when is the time  ya ya do i do that which i'd be very interested in doing or go and work with these autistic children to to give as you say something back to the community or is going to this conference giving something back to the community  well i think you have to follow your instincts and that you said not at present time it's the same as me not going to vancouver  mhhm  i struggled with that because it's good for my career it's good for me personally but it was the wrong time  i know you did ya   ya the timing was wrong  so i really uhm   i just i'm having a difficulty tying myself down to one thing so maybe i'd be i wouldn't be  somebody that would get full throttle into uhh one area of my life because i just want to be trying other things   it's hard to say you're s you're  word at it  words words  have another option  words   well i know  words i bet there's a rush  words   mhhm   mhhm mhhm   well are we going to change things and   and get involved without word   for two times  right   well i think that's very uh that's very  common that anybody in words   words  words   words   i i know what you're saying  i lived in/-> i've lived in a lot of different areas and uh that perhaps the passion for it is wonderful  and i don't have that passion for this for this whether it's something i deliberately set myself not to have because of what's going on with arnie uhha   or whether i just don't have it  that's an interesting question  and you know i pursue it in my words    cos there there's  other things that we put up around us  we do it subconsciously word  have   mhhm   your eyes are the same colour as your sweater  oh really they're not words   words   no laugh words   it's absolutely amazing they are identical in  colour to your sweater word that  sweater on   seriously   i know ya  ya it's really pretty  uh that's a very interesting question   we might not ever know the answer to that the fact that how do you set yourself up words interest is  words because it's  a a safety net for me and you know what  words   yes   or you go out and you're just not  interested   i'm not interested yup  it's interesting  that's very interesting   words it's something i've never got to before before and i've been meaning to ask  it's been asked  four years that i've been at the same environment and uhm  i would say two of it are not excited by it  they're not excited by the academic part of it  no   which i usually am excited about the   aca academic part of anything i've been involved in  i used to love going to the library and doing things  i'm not excited by the technical part of it because i've done it all before  is that because the political word  atmosphere you know word because of  conflict between the research work that you're doing  and the and the clinical work you're doing  it is it is causing  i don't know what it would word   but driving a wedge in words   i think there's   it's that's part of it   i think that words   well it's it's made me uncomfortable because i'm not sure of my my   it's the whole thing that's wrong with that clinic  and there's lack of structure and supervision from the day went there it's been like that  mhhm   it's turmoil  it's word and chaos and you know i do not as much as i'm pretty organized all the time i have to really  word / [ >   ya that's that is   word like a place that's that's   well organized  they don't like the chaotic situation because given a chaotic situation if you're not totally organized which is most of you because if you were it'd be word laugh  you'd need somebody to do that for you  mhhm   you'd need the structure you need  the system to do that for you   words   for years i've been words   now you'd think that that's chaos but  words that would be structure to deal with chaos   that there's a nice confusion    that would be such a nice confusion ya   ya well  so you know there are steps to take  and it doe doesn't   it doesn't happen there  it's really frustrating there   did it happen at the other clinic that you worked at  mhhm  do you miss that  mhhm  uhha  could you go back and work there  ya but i don't want to back and work there  right   i need to get away from that type of work   ent entirely   but i think bo both types of work that you've been doing with terminally ill patients  is ah is very demanding  it's very demanding   ya  you're meant to be there  well ya but i'm you know i told you that the  c s c and quite interesting in that  department   mhhm   that's a word word  mostly  yes they did baby care they do ah pre-natal classes they do all kinds of things  it it's like a city in there word   well i know that's what's kind of interesting  about it   what would i be doing people phone rings   get them word in the hospital  like morris you know uhh uh coming in and half the kids have an ear ache   the brown paper word   word a good idea   yup  oh okay i'll lift it up there  as soon as you leave i'll go there and lift it  i mean ya i guess i laugh   laugh lift it where  words oh i see the cup on the bureau  words words   words ya  actually there is a small desk down there that is about it's not quite as long as that and it's maybe the  same same width  but don't forget that the word   ya  that ya do you think that that would do   uhm maybe  cos the bureau is high and and  the girth would be awkward  ya   well you don't want something that low because then you're bending word   bending over   i would rather have something a bit higher   alright okay well the bureau is certainly ah you know words   that's right and there're going to be eight foot  pieces of wood so  that's cool   ya   all right well then you know that will make jackson  happy  i've cleared out quite a bit  most of it  ya i took out about uh five or six boxes and a couple of bags of clothes  i'm just gonna try and recycle the clothes you like uh  civic duty but after sp spending  at least forty-five minutes on the phone and i only got to hear about a word in you know a couple of other areas and i thought no i'm not going to sit here  and try and figure out which  words   ya laugh   ya   no not waste your time   ya  so  and the paint i uh i  managed you know like if i'll just have to tell them listen  it's ah it's just gonna going to   have to sit here for a couple more days until i uh  words   words laugh   well a month laugh   no until words   no no no july july  july is at least my intent or something like that  alright   it's it's my next shot in this area  i'll be done by then so  right  good good  well i have probably told you uh that two by eight uh  words three pieces there  words a couple of pieces   good
