 in fact it was one of her very first signs uhh that i noticed driving down the road in towards ormstown  there's a beautiful sign for uhm brysonwood farms  with a big holstein cow on it  a beautiful green sign with a coloured cow under the name  just a really nice almost looked like a logo   uhm in fact i asked the owners  i drove in and spoke to them and incidentally said where  where did you get that beautiful sign  they they told me about suzanne and tut suzette  sorry and led me to her home  now she's set up in the basement of the old family farm  it's it's full of stone walls quite warm and cosy but it's filled with all sorts of modern woodcutting painting equipment  all sorts of things  well you you've described  the the one uh the one outside of the uh the   the holstein farm  but what types of signs does she make  well you've probably seen this sort of thing  uh pointe-claire village for instance is full of them  many of which are actually suzette's   but you've seen them other elsewhere in say ski towns up north in stowe perhaps in vermont  the typical nice wooden sign  they're textured signs  very colourfully painted  and there's lettering on them of course  but they've also got animals or scenes or something or other that make kind of a picture or a logo  uhm but i spoke to suzette ann gaston in her basement workshop  so why don't i let her explain a little bit more about what she does  probably a lot of what uhh people are seeing now is ah sandblasted signs  uh the sandblasted signs are made from california redwood or  sometimes western red cedar  uhm the reason for that being they're very durable outside and they have a very pronounced grain pattern so when they are actually sandblasted  the uh the wood grain shows up and it  h it gives it a very unique warm look uhh that people seem to go for  and then finished with uh ah i do a lot of fine art renderings of well we do a lot of farm signs cows and and special paintings that people order  we cut out the pattern on th the  on the sign   uhm peel away the parts that we want sandblasted and then uh uh blast away and that wears the uhm soft sapwood down leaving the uh  the growth rings standing out  and that's what gives you the uh the  pronounced grain patterns  and it leaves the letters and whatever details uh we have standing out from the background of the sign  a lot of your signs very three dimensional and   and imaginative with flowers and bees and animals in uh odd places  you're very artistic  well thank you  uhm we always try to add some sort of pictorial element that uh draws people's eyes at something special  it just sets uh our signs apart from from the rest and we really try to work at that  but it's a whole field of study  uh the design the uh the colours the artwork it's just uh it's like a a   puzzle that i'm continuously working at and uh trying to come up with uh new and better designs and uh it's just uh a whole world of fun  well some villages like stowe for instance i think they've passed bylaws where everybody's sign has to be a a  wooden sign  that certainly benefits s some  businesses like yours  oh yeah i think that's a terrific idea  laugh   i think everyone should do that  uhm  is that sort of thing happening in quebec  uh yes  in fact i have quite a lot of work in pointe-claire village  uh they have a a non-illuminated sign bylaw there  uhm which gives i if you've ever been to the village it just gives a really nice warm village-type feeling  to uh to a shopping area  how do you sell your product  well that's a tricky one  i it's very difficult to   adverti advertise end of tape   credible incredible  tape starts mid word amount of work just from that  it's the signs when people see them they know that's what they want but   i see farms   i mean i passed one on the road uh brysonwood  that's what caught my eye  that's right   i went in and asked who made that sign  well that's great  that's one of my very first signs  and they're they're good friends and good neighbours and uh we did a business card design to to  ah match their's  they advertise in the the holstein journal and they have an an ad that matches   their uh their sign  so it's getting the farmers in to uh thinking about this a little bit more  a lot of people are are selling their uhm genetics more and ah and travelling abroad and this just gets them uhm a little extra cach&eacute;e i think  a little image  that's right  precisely  i should be starting uhm a farm sign for a an  apple farmer in rockburn pretty soon  a a nice sandblasted sign  i'm looking forward to doing that one  those are really my favourites  and uh we're working on some glass right now  we're doing a little decorative glasswork for the new clubhouse at the ormstown curling club  and uh just that kind of stuff that i i  really enjoy  it's a bit quiet right now but uh that's normal for this time of year  so what sort of equipment do you have here in your own home  you you work out of your basement  that's right  this is my big shop here  uhm i have a lot of hand tools uh s small  power tools  as you can see i'm limited as to space  we work with uh jigsaws and uh and that sort of thing  uhm i have a lot of chisels and and carving tools  it looks like if you get busy you're going to have to expand from the basment  uh yeah that's we have uh kind of tentative plans to uh convert the shed on our house to ah to more more  shop space and build on a little bit   but right now it's nice to run it  it's cosy down here  uh sometimes it gets a little bit full  uh my mom works for me part time so when the two   what does she do   uh she coats out panels  she cuts things out  uh really everything short of designing and doing the fine art things  uh and uh we have a lot of fun together so  now this is a business going on on the side of a  chicken farm  is laugh   that's right laugh   i always say laugh   laugh which one takes precedent   laugh   laugh i tell people that uhm my husband is president in charge of the chickens and i'm vice-president  and i'm president in charge of the signs and he's vice-president  so uh he helps me when he can and uh i uh help him out when  i can  we just have a a new batch of chickens in there now so i spent most of the morning in the barn and now i'm  back at my desk uh doing design work  so uh i i started this as a uhm as a way to do something with my my  art here from the farm and it's really uhm   it's really succeeded uhm amazingly well in   in a short time  did you marry into chicken farming  laugh uh yes in fact  i've i just grew up down the road here and i used to work on a farm as a uhm as a student   i worked for for my uncle and drove  ah combines and tractors and that sort of thing  and then i started going out with the guy i met on the school bus  and uh well here we are  uh we're partners on the farm and uh and partners  in the sign business too  so it's really uh the best of both worlds as far as i'm concerned  hmh who is that again  it's suzette ann gaston   yeah that's right that's right  laugh i ask the questions  i give the answers laugh   you're kind of  superfluous   laugh   laugh i'm that's  tullochgoram signs   tullochgoram signs   word i'm gonna  going to say   who are you anyway laugh   laugh   she must have a sign out front of her   oh a beautiful one yes  uhm one of her best pieces i think with a nice little scene on it  no chickens just a nice sign laugh   that's nice actually it's not  it's not a clich&eacute;   oh she does she's got   kit kitchen full of small signs   as of as a showroom  you know people come into her home and there's all this wonderful  examples   but what do they cost  well uh she does plain plywood ones which can be as  as little as a hundred and fifty dollars or   or so for just for your  h home's name or your own name  sort of a little sign hanging outside y  your property  if you want one of the sandblasted ones in the   in the redwood they cost anywhere from two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars on up  i mean if you're going for a big big sign then of course it's quite a bit more  hmh   cos she tells me redwood's about uhm oh a thousand feet of it costs her five thousand dollars five thousand dollars for for redwood so    hmh   hmh   duane thank you  okay  it's radio noon  duane johnson theme music   stick with us here at radio noon  next on the program we have the farm panel theme music   it's now twenty-one minutes to one o'clock and it's time for our farm panel  bob hebert is a sheep and beef producer in danville  that's in the eastern townships  hi bob   hi mary   genie nuberg is a dairy producer in rawden  that's in the lanaudi&egrave;re region  hi genie   hello  and hugh maynard is the executive director of the quebec  farmers' association  hi there hugh    you're on the phone because you are at the national dairy uhh conference going on in in toronto  wha what's happening    that's right  duane mentioned that  do you have one of her signs    laugh     oh you don't have a name yet    we could have a radio noon contest  name that farm    laugh stuart will do that    are there issues being discussed that that  would be of specific interest and and  importance to genie     remind us again about where the government is on b s t  bovine somatropin our government    hmh    genie are there any particular issues that  that you would want discussed or brought up at this sort of meeting  well yes and no  i mean all management issues are always probably  what is gonna going to to be the most interest in in the future    mind you we're still wondering bout  about b s t  and uhm at our milk meeting we asked about it and uh their  seeming was well if it comes it comes but we're not we don't really want it   and i think there's more and more people speaking out against it now  hmh hmh  that's about you know i think management cos that's what's going to save us in uh this this   that race of ours     is is quebec politics still one of the uh issues that is discussed in the corridors    laugh well so far bob we've   we've talked b s t so let's bring let's bring in   let's bring in in earnest the referendum  we'll talk about something else that's laugh also unpopular  the p q parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois is once again demanding that that quebec opt out of uh national agricultural program  no its u p a lunion des producteurs agricoles  that's doing that  the u p a  yeah  hmm    now now    it seems that way  i refuse to touch that one    but the u p a is is doing that  is that is that something that the government is likely to do  bob   well uh mister piteraine is uh uh asking them to uh to stay out of some of these programs  at least uh to give the administration to the provincial government but hand over the money in order to do this but uh i don't know  i don't think that's very surprising  they they've always sort of been in uh  you know of that policy a at   the at the u p a  and uh one must remember that they have a huge influence over provincial agricultural budget but they have much less over the federal one  and uh you know very well that unions don't run on ethanol  they run on power  and uh and that's what this is isn't it   laugh   laugh   laugh   boy are we in a rotten mood today guy  no no laugh
