 in canada it was legalized in nineteen sixty-nine so it must have been after that  under trudeau  under trudeau yeah  was that when he made his speech uh the state has no right in the bed   yes   really  yes  oh okay  in the bedroom   and a lot of people are saying when   like in the attempt to include sexual orientation as a grounds for discrimination in the human rights act  people are saying like the reformers people from the reform party  canadian political party are are uhm saying uhm we should go back to that concept of the state has no place in the beds of the nation  in other words don't make anti-discrimination laws  which is ridiculous  yeah it's interesting how those the fed  the how the kinds of uh word  something to do with the evolution of the state in the last twenty years that they're kind of  the rhetoric that would have been appropriate to liberalism has now become appropriate to a kind of conservative outlet  uh huh  well it's the difference i think between uhm looking at uhm equality of opportunity or or pure equality  you know uh are we satisfied just to treat everybody equal or do we want everyone to have equality of opportunity  uh huh   in which case some people have to be treated  preferentially  well that was the that was  the i guess the uh discourse of liberalism uh in the middle of the century when word  focused more on a a kind of legal equality   or uh or nominal equality  uh huh   hmm   that is uh you know everyone is uh equal under the law  yeah yeah certain amount of a a  focus on individual rights rather than any focus on uh experiences of  groups in particular or   hmmm   but i think that's that latter  you know concept of equality is is coming around  a lot of that is to do with the charter  yeah yeah  although it's kind of interesting because uhm in the long run you don't want to uh   well this this argument is is  is uh it comes up in in some of the feminist theory that that i end up reading  because the idea is that uh the main issue is that  uhm as you say preferential treatment for certain groups but in the long run you want in a sense the not only  the uhm the sense of group but also the preferential treatment to disappear or the the distinction to disappear  hmmm  because what creates distinction in the first place and what creates the need for preferential treatment is a history of disadvantage or domination  and then in that is is  to a large extent what creates identity in groups that are   you know   oppressed   uh huh   uh huh   so uhm it's like like cindy  was saying would say that identity uhm can only emerge from uhm a position of disadvantage  uh huh  and that's why there's no canadian identity as such because we never really managed to words there's a strong qu&eacute;bec identity  right but then then you get to the question of is this real disadvantage or perception of disadvantage  ya ya because   because i understand qu&eacute;bec sort of disadvantages are a rhetorical argument too political argument  yeah   yeah cough word   but part of a cynical side of me that kinda   kind of thinks that everyone likes to feel disadvantaged  there's something about human nature that makes us want to feel disadvantaged to feel part of some sort of a group  laugh short phrase  laugh   laugh i i i i  never really thought of uhm  it never occurred to me that people uh wanted to uh  hmmm maybe i did it  maybe i should uh think about that  or you don't do it and that's why you don't have a  an identity laugh   laugh but i no  i don't have a word or weren't stupid   laugh   uh but there's also uh i don't know i mean uhm i have a strong sense of personal identity  but it's true that i lack a sense of group identity  which is uh that's that's kind of true so uh  hmm   where'd you get that t-shirt  in new york in new york word   word oh ya   remember when i was there with uh ryan   when was that  oh it was in october of ninety-three  ah  yeah  for thanksgiving   uh yeah it was the thanksgiving weekend in the states  yeah   down to new york two or three words    hmmm   shouldn't have flown should have taken the bus but   but anyways i was doing field work then and so i couldn't really i didn't really have the time to spare  uh huh  so other than that i would have taken the bus  so anyway i want to get back  tell tell me a little bit about this priest thing  it takes place in where  in london in in england   uh uhm liverpool   liverpool  and he's anglican or catholic   catholic   catholic priest  hmm and so he's his dilemma i had the impression from some of the promos and stuff that it was  it was also a question was on uh assault or he had to uh  he was told something in confession and had  to  yeah there's two there's two  parallels issues  one is his homosexuality the other is incest which is disclosed to him uh in the confessional booth  hmmm   and his personal crisis is whether to uphold the traditions and the rules of the church and not and not   uhm not disclose not not uhm reveal what was disclosed to him or to stop the suffering of this girl who wouldn't allow wouldn't wouldn't give him permission to tell   her her mother  wait who confessed the girl  the girl confessed but she didn't want him to tell anyone  and do anything about it and so uh  why did she confess  i mean she uh usually you confess sins   yeah i know but i mean she had to talk to someone she just it was after she after she'd finished confessing   and then and uhm she just hadn't told anyone in her life so  so i mean he is struggling with his dilemma which was uh basically the whole idea whether the church should be uh we should recognize uhm the the problems in institutional constraint and be flexible enough to allow for uh changes in the rules when when we need or whether tradition and authority should always uh win over  and that's the same thing with him  i mean should he uh be allowed to experiment with his sexuality in order to be a better priest in order to know himself better or uhm does he have to totally repress everything so   hmmm   and at the end he and at the end   he he's charged with uh conducting in an act and uh he's like ostracized from the whole parish and everyone you know what i mean  and it's this really wonderful uh his fellow   colleague priest is really great  and he comes he he encourages uhm   the the priest the first priest to come back and do mass together with him and uhm in that way he'd be showing that his sin is no greater than the uh the sins of the average person  uhm and so he does that but everyone in the congregation  in the parish uh totally ostracizes him except for that one young girl who ah who wrote to him her incest  so so that's showing you   that's just showing that they each are supporting each other  anyway uh he's very emotional laugh   laugh   like and afterwards he was very mad at himself for  not not stopping her suffering  and he apologized to her cos he knew he was  he should have stopped the suffering but he didn't and so i think that turned out with that  she was the first one to forgive him for his sins which made   it her her forgiveness all the more christian and all the more uhm uh laudable  right but did she blame him for not   no   but the mother did and maybe she did herself  you mean blame him for not telling   yep   and her mother did  her mother did  her mother blamed it on the priest at the end  this is your fault that we didn't know  if you had told us we would have stopped this and i hope you rot in hell  oh dear   so ya   pretty serious stuff  ya  but it was an interesting study by incest uhm victims and perpetrators  uh i wonder the character that was the perpetrator is  uhm is traditional is what you would expect the attitude to be if that person were to be  which is totally unapologetic totally unapologetic  he would actually talk to the priest about it and say i'm just doing what every man every husband every father wants to do and that  it's uh   this is in the film  ya ya ya   the perp perpetrator   the the guy says  the ather defends his acts vehemently and says stay out of my business  and i asked matt if he thought that that was uh  wha which is often the attitude of perpetrators or if they would feel guilty you know  but apparently not  but at least in his opinion they were quite uhm uhm willing to accept and condone their own activities   so then why would he have any special knowledge  that's true laugh   laugh that'd be like a police detective or words   he's catholic laugh   he's catholic  yeah two or three words arrived at the church  right  cough truly he doesn't know anything about incest but it just is uh  four words if we know anything about   word   laugh   hey man that's that whole concept of liberalism  can we speak  laugh   probably slander anybady can we   laugh   specially especially  people who can't who won't defend themselves like  words   laugh   words gonna  going to stand up and go hey that's not true  i feel guilty as heck like whoops laugh   laugh   but uhm ah but when i i  read i don't know how true this is but ah uhm i heard a kind of anecdotal story about eighteenth century jesuits in training in rome #> and uhm before they ah i guess i think there's a period called an initiate and before you actually become a priest become ordained as a priest you're still i guess uh in a sense a jesuit but an initiate  and uhm so there's sort of an anecdotal story about the this a kind of a prof or whatever who told his students you know uh like sometime before the ordination was due to take place the students had you know been fairly successful in their courses  the the prof advised them to go out and you know buy a hooker in the streets back streets  of rome so that they would know something about human sexuality if they didn't already because it would help in their uhm   and they should deal with that part of their character whatever kind of you know sexuality they had because it would make them a better priest in the end  before they were quite ordained   before they actually became priests  because once be becoming  becoming a priest there's no uh there're  no one asks you uh if you've ever gotten laid  before   uh huh   it's just they ask you they they ask you  to take a vow of celibacy  hmm hmmm  and uhm  which unless you're married it was a sin anyway to get a   multiple words   but ya a much a much lesser  one really a much lesser one  than breaking the vows of celibacy  well yeah i think so ya  although you know to read medieval to  read read some types of documents from early modern europe you get the impression that priests were always uh you know  at the time of the the name  council uhm uhm there seems to have been this concern that priests everywhere were co-habiting with women and stuff like this  and so uh the the church authorities the catholic church authorities roman catholic authorities were often uhm you know uh kept   prohibiting this kind of stuff  uh huh  so the fact that they were prohibiting this stuff suggests that they thought it was occurring  uh huh  it's kind of difficult to say i guess how uhm sorta sort of bad priests were by the  by the the standards of the church hierarchy so  uh huh
