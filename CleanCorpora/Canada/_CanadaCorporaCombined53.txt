 headlights on  ya  ya   two words i'm sure  so how did you get involved in the in the  uhm canada world youth  well the first time i uh i went traveling overseas on my own i guess was with crossroads  canadian crossroads international  and uh it's a volunteer organization  they send canadians any anyone  over the age of nineteen to a developing country to do uh a short-term volunteer work placement  by short-term you're talking  three to six months  oh  so it's not too long  ya   it's not like one of those two year commitments  or anything   uh huh   mhh hmm   ya i went there and did my bit and got sick and recovered  and   ya   do you find that you get sick whenever you go to any of these countries  well i find it's a great weight-loss program for me  i i usually drop ten to fifteen pounds or so  laugh i see   i come back i'm feeling trim   ya and then you gain it back and then  well this last time i i didn't lose much weight  in in canada world youth i had a really  good host family which was super cautious with me the group leader and  uh i i actually gained a bit of weight living with them  laugh   and uh it was too bad cos i was hoping to drop a few pounds  word   and that was in india was it  that was in india   ya ya   and then i came back here and put on about thirty  so it was like uh  ya   some of their food is really interesting isn't it  ya  it's uh like their not 'they' uh uhm have a chicken that's red  oh ya tandoori chicken   tandoori chicken  huh i love that   it's good eh   ya ya  i came across uhm a marinade that you can use to do that   like the patak's tandoori marinade  uh ya ya   the red paste stuff  and so  well this is a powder  and so uh i thought well there's nothing saying you   have ta have to use it with chicken  you could probably use it with other things   oh sure   so now when i sometimes when i cook rice i'll put some in so that the rice turns out red and  and has that flavour  awright alright   oh is it ever good  i've never thought of that  ya it's really good  you should try it laugh   laugh okay   do you like spicy food  not too sp spicy   i i i like the spice  i don't like the hea heat   the hot spices   okay   so uhm i have to sort of steer clear of it you know  it gives me a burning mouth laugh   when i was in uh india the second time i met this professor there who was he was like over six feet tall which is really unusual for indian men   for indian men ya   and uh a very stately looking gentleman  and and he spoke english very well  but he said to me you know americans are the best users of the english language he told me  and i said what  really laugh   what are you talking about i said   he says well you know when americans when they eat something spicy they say the food will burn at both ends   he said only an american could come up with an expression like that laugh   laugh   isn't that  ya they have some uh very neat uh uh things that they  get away with   ya laugh   you know i'll agree with him there  but uh but i found that their the  food that i had  while we had a a student from canada world youth uhm what they cooked was really interesting  hmm   i enjoyed it  they did some uhm a vegetable dish with cauliflower snd it was really good  alright  and uhm actually they did several dishes  the girls got together and and uh cooked a meal for us and  what did did you have girls with you or did you have guys   no i had boys  ya boys with me  but uh i got to be quite friendly with some of the girls and they came over one night and i was cutting uhm the uhm group leader's hair uh  uh laugh   really   well i always cut my son's hair and my husband's so they asked me oh well that would be nice cos then it wouldn't cost us to have our hair cut  right right   so then you know you cut one and the you got another and another and pretty soon i got the group leader there too  laugh   laugh   so we made an afternoon of hair cutting and the girls cooked up a storm there and we had a lovely dinner  laugh   well great  ya it was fun  i enjoyed that  one of the indians in my group decided to go to   a a barber shop to get his hair cut just so he could tell his friends i paid laugh twelve dollars for a haircut  laugh that worth it  ya   laugh oh boy   it's pretty funny  especially when you can pay twenty-five cents for one  laugh back there  it's funny   oh ya   ya that's what they were saying  it's very inexpensive there  so they i mean there would be no reason why anybody would do it at home  but uhm with four sons ah and a husband i decided a long time ago i better learn to cut hair   ya for sure  i i try i keep asking rachelle  to cut my hair for me you know   oh ya   so it would save us a bit of money  sure   but she refuses  she says no way  i don't wanna want to look at  ya you laugh after i cut your hair  ya you might ah laugh   might make a mistake a few times but after a while you learn  you know  and there's guides on those things all the time  y you know that you can put on  you don't even think about it anymore  i've been going to this uh  the cheapest place i've found is is  just down the street  he charges just ten dollars but i'll  admittedly it's not the best haircut laugh i'll get   in in my life   laugh   but   well you know now the kids have the really short haircuts you know maybe three words   ya ya on the side   ya   ya right  and uh so uh my grandsons they all come up to get their hair done now  they don't mind grandma giving them a haircut now because it's just a runnin running the   the razor all over their head with the guide on it  laugh   right   well uh harry who is twelve decided that he would come and get his hair cut and uh then his dad decided he wanted his hair done too  mhh   so i said okay  so when his dad sat down i said well how you know what do you want it done  he said oh i just want it cut a little shorter  just trimmed up  i said well how short  oh he said just use that long the longest guide    mhh hmm   so i did and i went right up the back of his head first of all and i said i hope you don't change your mind cos this is really quite short you know laugh   laugh   at that time it was too late so he ended up with a very short haircut all over him laugh   right   what did he think of it afterwards  uhm well he said uh it'll grow in before winter laugh  he works out in the bush laugh   he's actually he's a mechanic and he  has been working for a logging company and uh has just been in the last six months transferred over to the b c british columbia  highways department ah uhm  alright   it's er a private ent  enterprise a private company now though isn't it  i have no idea   uhm ya but it's still highways department  and so he's uhm doing their mechanic work out of north vancouver  so he's uhm used to being outdoors in all kinds of weather  you know if a vehicle breaks down they gotta  have got to go to the vehicle eh  right right   so uh well it'll grow in  because he's in the wintertime he grows his hair long and he grows a beard to keep his face warm  laugh   wow   i i used to hate driving in  in b c in the wintertime  those mountains  oh ya   and uh in nelson  in nelson a little bit   ya that's scary   the way that town's situated it's  uhm it's pretty scary sometimes   or going down that hill going in ta  in to trail   oh ya  isn't that a wild ride eh  i wouldn't i don't think people go down that in the wintertime do they  i never i never went to laugh  trail in the wintertime   oh wow   if you want an experience go to trail sometime  they
