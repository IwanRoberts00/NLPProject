 thank you cough madame speaker  let me uh at the outset uh commend the honourable member for bringing uh his motion forward  it's uhm it's timely and uhm i'm pleased to be able to add a to address the motion and acknowledge the treatment of ukrainian-canadians at the hands of  past governments  we all agree that uh mistreatment of canadians because of their origin is unacceptable  unfortunatelty madame speaker the history of our country has not always reflected the principles of justice and equality that make us proud canadians today  thankfully this sad chapter in our history is now behind us   of course if history cannot be changed howe   however these events must be brought out into the open  this mister speaker concerns each of us  we firmly believe that canadians must be aware of the   of situations like this one and that it is important to set the record straight  madame speaker our government today is commited to building a strong multicultural society one that abides by the rules of justice human rights and mutual respect  the basis of this uh commitment is clear understanding of how canada came to be  we must be able to confront our history and and  to face up to our past  prime minister mulroney ha has  committed himself to a formal apology regarding the matter of ukrainian-canadians interned during the first world war  we must not forget that ukrainian-canadians helped build this country  we must not forget that the history of ukrainian-canadians is closely interwoven with the growth and the achievements of the prairies  their contribution to canadian life which began in the eighteen hundreds continues today  as canada's fifth largest ethno-cultural group the ukrainian-canadian community is present in every sphere of activity cultural professional educational political religious and financial  with a network of over a thousand organizations and a highly organized structure the community has a voice in over a hundred and fifty towns and cities across this country  ukrainian-canadians have come a long way  ninety percent of the community is canadian - born and therefore fully integrated into the mainstream of canadian culture  nonetheless madame speaker uh ukrainian-canadians are strongly attached to their heritage and therefore determined to maintain their culture their language and their identity  ukrainian-canadians are a perfect example of the country we are striving to build  they are full-fledged canadians with ukrainian heritage that gives them a unique flavour  their personality they they   personify i should say our our  multicultural society  as people committed to their language religion and  and cultural heritage the ukraine ukrainian   community has long since been the most outspoken advocates for a multicultural nation one that recognizes that diversity i  is fundamental uh is a fundamental characteristic of our country and a vital part of being canadian  in nineteen eighty-six the the ukrainian community produced an in depth study entitled building the future ukrainian-canadians in the twenty-first century  as the title suggests the document is proof that ukrainian-canadians are turned towards the future  they are men and women of action  the document established a strategic process of renewal and coordination within the ukrainian community in canada  it set specific goals in education arts communication cultural development as well as public policies and programs  they clearly stated that mulchie  multiculturalism was the key to maintaining their culture while  participating fully in the larger canadian society  ukrainian-canadians promote the concept of functional  trilingualism and many of them exemplify this goal by being fluent in english french and ukrainian  today yur ukrainians  can identify or can definitely pride laugh themselves   in being amongst the architects of the canadian multiculturalism act passed in nineteen eighty-eight  because they refused assimilation ukrainian-canadians have met challenges of integration while retaining their essential qualities of their heritage  today our country is proud of the numerous ukrainian - canadian personalities who contribute to the innumerable facets of canadian life  a life at rideau hall with governor general ray hnatyshyn  life in the supreme court with john sopinka  life in the world of sports of with  hockey players like like dale hawerchuk and mike bossy  life in the business world with bill terran to name uh a few among the many  these people and thousands more madame speaker confirm the enormous contribution of ukrainian-canadians to the economic and social development of this land  the ukrainian community ukrainian-canadian community i should say has come a long way  despite difficulties ukrainian-canadians have done well  they are a strong and and vital community and one that continues to prosper  this year ukrainian-canadians are celebrating the proud centenary of the ukrainian settlement in canada  the official opening which was held at the end of august marked the beginning of festivities that will unfold throughout the country during the next twelve months  the official closing of this centennial celebration in october  nineteen ninety-two will coincide with the triennial congress of ukrainian-canadians  many special events are planned by individuals and organizations on national regional provincial and local levels   what better time for this ukrainian for  th for this ukrainian-canadians to commemorate and honour their rich historical past salute their present and create a vision for the future  as the government stated in in this week's proposal for constitutional reform it is true that this country and its and its creation has not taken place without pain and suffering  the aboriginal people uh in particular have paid a high price for other people's search for freedom  canada has not always been inclusive and many have been left out of the benefits of citizenship  yet despite these gaps which are now uh only now acknowledging uh we are now only now  acknowledging and trying to remedy canada remains deeply symbolic of freedom in its broadest sense  many around the world still long to come to our shores to share in what we have built  people in other nations continue to risk their lives and sacrifice their security for freedoms that prev previous  generations have already guaranteed for us in this country  what better time madame speaker for all canadians to recognize the contribution of this vibrant community one which has undergone tremendous change over the past hundred of years but one that retains values traditions  and a language and all fundamentals of our canadian way of life  thank you very much   introduce next speaker   thank you very much mister speaker   excuse me madame speaker   uhh i too would like to thank and congratulate the honourable member from kingston for uh bringing this matter to the house today  it is a matter that uh has cried out for effective treatment for a long time   i'd like to start madame speaker by asking yourself and through you the other members present here today to uh conjure up a picture  in in your mind   uhm place yourself on on highway one a the the road that uh was there before the trans-canada highway one was built northwest of banff in the   in the bow river valley within the canadian rockies about halfway up highway one a between banff and lake louise at a junction  in front of the towering castle mountain which is a wall of rock  that stretches literally for miles rising up on the east side of the bow river valley   place yourself there in your mind on the road in the flatlands of the valley in the winter  few people stop along this road especially in the winter  the scenery is stupendous   the towering mountains are brilliant in their fresh coat of snow  and and with every gentle wisp of breeze the pine trees drop a cascade of snow in s   in a sparkling dazzle of crystals and colour  occasionally a car swishes by speeding towards banff to the south or lake louise and other points to the north   and madame speaker if while standing there you close your eyes and stand stock still and again use your imagination you can see another scene  a shockingly disturbing scene   right there and not very long ago for between nineteen fourteen and nineteen twenty in one of the most shameful episodes of canadian history thousands of recent immigrants to canada were imprisoned there  the concentration camp near castle mountain outside banff was only one of the twenty-six such internment camps scattered across the country  thousands of ukrainians and other people of east european descent  were designated enemy aliens stripped of their property and denied their civil rights  over eighty thousand people mostly of ukrainian origin were forced to carry identification papers and report to local police   over eight thousand others were separated from their families  confined behind barbed wire and forced into hard labour  and what was the crime that justified this imprisonment this massive injustice perpetrated under the provisions of the recently passed war measures act   madame speaker there wasn't one   these ukrainians were simply recent immigrants who happened to hold austrian passports  many simply didn't have a job   these were not enemies of canada  in fact the british government expressly informed the canadian government that these ukrainians should be considered friendly   in fact many of them had fled their homes to avoid being conscripted into the austro-hungarian army  but even though they had committed no crime these new canadians were forced to build the internment camps that contained them to build the roads including the predecessor to that highway one a to clear the land to cut wood and work on railway construction projects  later they were forced to work at miserable pay for private companies   thousands of us drive past these sites   these sites that used to be internment camps every year  yet few canadians know the extent of the hardship that was caused in canada to our own   canada should finally acknowledge that this gross injustice occurred here  we can never right the wrongs that were committed but we can teach our children what happened why it happened in the hope that they may learn from the past so that such injustice may not happen again  for this reason madame speaker i and the new democratic caucus and party of which i am a member very strongly support several steps  first an official acknowledgement by the government of the serious injustices that were inflicted on these ukrainian-canadians  second the placement of historical plaques at appropriate sites near those twenty-six internment camps  third the establishment of a national redress commission to review requests for redress of discriminatory acts of past canadian governments and recommend appropriate and expeditious action to deal with this and other dark episodes in our history  in addition madame speaker we support the partial reconstruction of that castle mountain camp in alberta as an educational site to which canadians could go and other visitors could go be encouraged to pause along their drive through the majestic rockies to reflect on what they themselves might do to ensure that such a f  sorry event never occurs in canada again and madame speaker perhaps as well to reflect on what it is that human societies can do to themselves when the idea of the enemy the other the apart  the separate becomes a more compelling idea than the certain knowledge that we are all of us brothers and sisters  madame speaker this is a motion completely worthy of the non-partisan support of all elements in this house  i greatly hope it receives that support  thank you   introduces next speaker   thank you madame speaker  i'm honoured madame speaker to speak in response to the motion by the honourable member and specially in light of the importance of the issues  being uh raised madame speaker   canada today is a vibrant and tolerant society that recognizes the essential nature of its multicultural reality  ukrainian-canadians have been major exponents of the recognition of the multicultural nature of canada  canadians can trace their origins to every part of the world  people from all over the world have played a major part in settling the land developing our resources building cities and forging transportation links over vast distances  madame speaker the internment of ukrainian-canadians during the first world war is not a proud moment in our history
