 scratch tests are very hard to do on this camera very hard to do because the minute you cut the loop you have to go back into the mag magazine redo it and re set it  with the eclair since it's two different doors you open the door  you pull out the film  you do a scratch test  to do a scratch test you hold the film up like that with a flashlight against the film and you can look at the top plane of the film  if you see any scratches there's a problem  then you turn it over and you do the same  and other than my finger prints from sliding across the film like that which you shouldn't have right before you do the scratch test  question question continues   every time you put a mag on you do a scratch test  question   well you have to go find out what's causing the scratch  question   there could be a little piece of film inside the mag  floating around causing scratches  there could be some fibres in here that are causing the scratches cos there's felt  there's insulation inside these magazines that can break off  there can be rubber  there can be a pace piece of tape   most common thing that happens is on a brand new roll of film   there's a more than a hundred foot word a four hundred feet there's a little piece of tape that keeps it all together and you have to peel that piece of tape off  now sometimes what happens is that tape falls into the mag  causes a big problem  so the best place is to put that tape off the film onto your hand  question   i just put it on my hand cos then i feel it  i know exactly where it is  right  and when i break off a piece of film inside the black bag i never break off anything this size cos then i have to look  agrees   i pull out like that and i break off something like this  and then put it off to the side and i'm going to be able to find something like this  those are  like pieces of film pieces of tape that's what can cause damage  like those are the biggest causes to what can cause a scratch inside  and also a loop too big touching the bottom here  y you know the first place you look is the loop to see where is the loop touching and is it touching anything   all right  question   no no no  if if you're shooting the next day  with the same footage okay and the same from the same film   leave it on  agrees   agrees   agrees   there's no need to uh recan  question   no you change your camera report to the next day  agrees   you don't change the mag  the mag's fine   ya  and now   question   ya you unload the exposed film  you basically put this in a can   okay   then attach this   and again and uh serve your camera word  you don't need to uh  uhm d depends like   what happens is if you're   a lot of times if you're travelling on a film set you're   gonna going to take apart your camera for safety reasons  so you're gonna going to take the mag  off the f film cam  camera off the film camera  anyhow and put it in its box  so you've unloaded it   and you're usually going to disassemble the camera   rarely do they keep it in tact   mostly when you work on a documentary and you're jumping in and out of a car the camera operator will hold the camera and the rest of the technicians will take what's needed and what's called a diddy bag which is the bag and run back and forth short exchange between za and a, not part of demonstration   now the difference between mags in this one is that  there you have to uh get it into the perforations and move it along  this there's nothing   y you don't need to make a loop  you just put the film in in the same formation   and word loop goes in here   well again it's the same system where you take the film   question short question/answer between zb and a   the mechanism that drives the camera is the same for both  as well as you know they came out at the same time  the were used for similar things  one was used for sound and one was used for just images but they were designed and built in and around the same time and modified  together  so really it's the lenses  if you put on the newest lenses of which you can on this camera you're going to have a very nice defined image  question   ya but i me mean if you're doing uh stock footage or special effects or slow motion  cos the beauty of this camera is that this is your motor right here   okay  the other motor is what controls the speed  so the other motor which i don't have with me is what creates a variable speed camera  you replace it and you just turn it from right to left   and here is a counter   question   ya  question   well what happens is it goes from zero to fifty all right which means that you're going basically a stop over or a stop under  with the film stocks that exist now with a latitude of three stops over and under and being able to correct the overexposed film in the lab  you don't have to worry about it at all  question   like the vision five hundred and the vision three-twenty  question   kodak   question   it's not the best  what it is is it's a very high-speed film with very low grain  in comparison to the regular five hundred a s a  so you can shoot at night with very low light to just ambient light that exists  question   it's called the vision five hundred   answer   it's a gold camera audience discusses film stocks   so you put the mag on  then you lock it  like that   and then you put the mag secure   question question   question   no this is just for security   agrees   this here it this toggle switch locks the mag in  agrees   question   you make the loop once you're inside  phrase   okay   okay   and then you just lock it  and then camera's secure  so you put this on just for safety because it might get bumped   cos this is the side your head's on   all right  so it can get bumped  so here again you open it up   to control the pin this time is with this  you turn it here on the motor and it moves the pin up and down   okay   frame by frame   all right  so what you do   i'm going to do this quickly and then i'm going to go make a phone call  is you press this button down  this allows you to be able to move in and out around here with your film  you then   no  phrase   ya   agrees agrees   so that you can see this clearly   okay   it's very simple   here there's a white line and here there's a white line   these two white lines that's your loop   that's the marker  what it is you pull the film forward like that   slide it in  so this is upside  no i'm s i'm looking at it upside down  it's right   okay  make the top of the loop   and   question   ya   it's hard two or three words to see what you're doing  there  there  you see it  i shut my door   okay   then i go and i make the bottom of my loop like so  question   ya short discussion among extra-corpus speakers   and then my film's loaded   like that  i just pick this up  tighten it before shooting   'kay okay now the trick this camera also jams and stalls  everything that can go wrong this camera will do without a doubt  question   no i just have to give this a  question   fits in like that   'kay okay   question     no no  this is the motor that drives the camera  this is the motor that drives the magazine  when you're using a hundred foot daylight spool which is on the  black   i don't know where on word   this is on these  okay   comment   comment   you don't need the magazine   all you do is where the mag pole is you put this in  agrees </o  okay  only problem is every time i've used one of these the cameras jam  if you have a daylight spool you can put it here   take out the black or put it here  pick it up on a core  it prevents from jamming   you know  and then you can do the whole thing outside   question   clarifies question   more question   this black one   this one   it can come out  agrees   if you lose it it's two hundred and fifty dollars  agrees   you have to make sure it goes back   and the lab won't return it  there's a little black market that's been going on     question   ya   it it can come out very easily  but at that time everything's word   okay  so basically your loop's done  you must tighten these otherwise they will break because  it's just a surge of power  cos this camera starts right away up at speed   a few words with these   and it shows the arrow of direction of which way it's supposed to turn   that's it  okay   and you can use a hundred foot spools and you can even use a hundred foot on core   right  you just take the black inside part of the core and you put it there and it'll pull your core so you get your twenty feet if that's what you have  just load it in a black bag   all right   and then for it to run it's on this battery   the thing about shooting with the hundred foot and the four hundred foot is because the hundred foot only uses one motor and the four hundred foot uses two motors  question   no you need more power but it's in one battery  and to prevent your camera from uhm you know the film breaking running too slow not going at the right speed when you're using just the arri s without the four hundred foot mag you must turn your battery on to eight volts  there's a switch  this battery belt doesn't have the switch so i can't show you the switch  okay     question   question continued   the arri s   one hundred foot roll in the camera which is  basic what what is called camera no i d which means there's no mag   question   to eight volts to prevent damage inside the camera cos you can brown out the battery  there's too much power going in  and then when it's running with the magazine you film it you put the power on to twelve volts or fourteen whatever the other one is  there's i can't remember it right now  and that's to run both motors with enough power   this one's already at that permanently and i think there's only one belt here that has the switch to go back and forth  okay  so you know this there's a plus   one is plus and one is obviously minus one  there isn't anything  red on the battery belt is always plus   okay   and that it runs like this audience response to camera noise   but i mean it's also open  it's usually quieter  comment   you can really hear your money go by  question   fourteen volt battery  question   no  okay this is what it sounds like  b this is your line   it's on but it's off   ya  question   that   question   i think they're paid enough not to  laugh i don't know  i've never asked them this  i really don't speak to the actors  it's not my role when i'm working the camera   there's a very high hierarchy  it's just not my role  i mean the cam camera   the actors might ask me uh what lens i might have and that's about it  that's my communication  i'll say move to the right more to the left  i don't know how it effects their psyche  well it's done the job  ya  it is loud but a lot of times you're with a very long lens far away  like one thing you can do with this camera is put a hundred and twenty mil millimeter lens   go real far away  get a nice wide to mid shot while this camera is doing a close up and run in sync   question   there is no book design for this  what happens is there's no insulation in the camera because it wasn't designed right for that but you can try to make your own  word for it with blankets
