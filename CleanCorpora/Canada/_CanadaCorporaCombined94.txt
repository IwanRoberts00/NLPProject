 long breath/snort   so it makes it even funnier  snort   and so then pretending to stifle a laugh   yeah ya you smartasses  i've never laughed so hard and then we had to keep it quiet like pretending to stifle a laugh   and then i'm starting to cry start laugh to the point where  end laugh i just  and then after a while mrs stockman 's like you know i'm going girls what you know what what's so funny  what's going on here  and sigh i almost ran out of class cos it was just so  laugh   and at and at one point   i just had to bury my head in my book and start laughing and like i had my two words   long hyena laugh everyone else's like  she's lost it  she's gone over the edge   they don't know what it was cos it was  just a quiet just a little   and it was so silly on to   it was just so stupid a but it was so funny i guess we could see the picture in our head  it was just so asinine and it was ah   and i was crying and to the point where you know  and i couldn't look at danielle   okay  cos whenever  and i could sometimes feel her looking at me and the i  wo it would just put me back into spasms of laughter you know and so that that was a pretty bad laugh   well it was funny but sigh anyway   quite a difference in our school  yeah  s'girl this girl falls asleep on her desk right our english teacher to takes  a this was uh mr stark uh someone was about to go wake her up and he says no no no let her sleep she's probly  probably had a tough night or something you know like starts laugh so she s they just let her   sleep through the rest of the class you know  oh no oh no   she's uh and then   we had this one math teacher who was uh who was known to have like he was a very good math teacher and and   a certain amount of strict but he was known to have   quite a temper so you didn't dick around you know  yeah  so we'd always cheat right at the beginning of the exam  because he always relied upon his uh upon his uh   his reputation  right  so for the first half of the exam he'd be sittn  sitting there readin reading  not payin paying attention to anything at all  and then the last half of the exam he'd take and he'd uh he'd uh  you know like he'd look around and watch people when they were done and everything like that breath tell 'em   them okay you can leave you know  yeah  he'd make a few people stay until like about half the class was done and then he'd say okay you can leave the rest of you  just uh just finish up your exam and everything  and so like at the beginning of the exam we'd just turn to all the hard questions and do them and look back and forth and  like i'd do one question and my friend would do another one  and we'd take and we'd switch our papers back and forth from de yeah oh yeah fr   no way long and drawn out   switch our papers back and forth from desk to desk we'd look at what the other person had done just so you know and then we'd we'd go and do the the we'd switch back and we'd do the problem that we'd just seen the other person do breath and if we got the same answer we just kinda kind of look over and you know like this laugh starts we kinda  kind of hold our tests up to each other it was so funny  laugh ends   laugh word   it was so hilarious because you knew that like all the tough ones were gonna going to be at the end and all the easy ones're gonna going to be at the beginning so  snort   you know you just took and uh you did   all t all the tough ones at the end and then the end of the exam you did the easy ones so it was pretty   i only i only  switched exams once in c&eacute;gep when when   one of the guys laugh starts one guy laugh ends  actually passed out in class cos he he i guess he'd been studying two or three days in a row and he literally had not been sleeping or something  uh huh  and it got it finally got to the midterm and he literally i think he passed out in class or he   really wow   like he was an old sort of  laugh   and for the teacher  like course of course they had to take him out cos this is an unusual situation so the teacher you know take him start whisper two words  end whisper go and she takes him out  and so we're all like we're now in an empty classroom i just word   it's li laugh most people are stunned  most people are stunned   three words it's like oh well   it's a time to act   word what's go and then ah teri w whadya   what did you get for number three laugh    laugh   and then like so i grab this test like okay yeah oh no  teri she made a mistake groan so anyway   at first it's actually the guy that we met i dunno   don't know if you remember he's in computer science so  we met him in the we saw him in the uh at the airport at concordia a little while ago with you me and jesse   mmm  was a guy blond shortish guy came by and i introduced you his name was ben but we named him bender   huh you just name people other things really  well no cos he never showed up to calculus laugh starts  class laugh ends   he got that cos he only showed up for six hours of his calculus term  so why did that give him the name bender   because john bender character from the movie the breakfast club never went to class four or five words    uh okay huh   i didn't i'll be fair for this i  dunno don't know did didn't see enough of the film to really  okay so  yeah that's but that's that's true  anything that happens anything like that that happens you have to take advantage of it  yeah  you know  and never put your name on your exam until you're done   my god  oh yeah ohh i di well you know  how stupid can you be you know  like you just don't put your name on it  that's funny they could pass it out and then they  exactly and even if even if  something comes down or somebody says something you know  and they say oh let's see your exam and you go here you know there it is ahem and unless you got a whole lotta  lot of essay questions and you got this really flowery handwriting you know  right  it's uh it's you know it's it's the same   sorta sort of thing   so uh but some of the laugh   there were a few things like that you know the teacher has to leave the room or there's a call for the teacher or something like that   soon as they close the door it's like number two  they must've known like i mean they're not idiots i mean   no of course not  i mean that was a different  i guess she had to take that into consideration  so funny  i know there was one girl i prolly probably   told you this before but you know molly   mr ramsey the guy who taught you economics   oh tim ramsey   tim ramsey well his daughter marlene  was in my class  yeah   uh huh  anyway but anyway and i  probly probably told you this before but she used to often fall asleep in class but she had like a   oh you told me about her she had some sort of  bit of a physical thing  she had she had medical  cond yeah   and so literally she would she would  pass out for several classes  it was the only prolly probably  the only person that could well get away with it i mean she ha i mean i think i all the teachers   had been notified or whatever that she had something  yeah   breath she would just i guess she couldn't   was she an insomniac maybe i don't know  mm hmm   but she i don't think she   could fall asleep before maybe two in the morning  oh wow  and when you're in high school   yeah it's kinda kind of rough  like now you know it's just like yeah you know so what   laugh half the time i don't go to bed until three   yeah laugh that's what time i usually go to sleep yeah   you know whatever  but it was like  some of us are idiots and stay up till seven  laugh but  but we won't go into that  no we won't  we won't go there   anyway but she so she conked out for like several classes breath   no one'd ever say anything  laugh   i w i went to pedro 's office today because i had the new uh i had the the   contracts drawn up and i also had the the  s labels  so i got the labels done and they didn't come out too bad  good  but i gotta got to change the uh i gotta got to change   the uhhh the company uhh font  the n m one fifty-six font because it's just defeated sigh  it's just not happenin happening   i went for a light like a light font  not a heavy not heavy letters clears throat  i went for light letters and it's ju   so it would look different than the heavy letters that are below it  just doesn't work  bad idea  yeah now i gotta got to take and redo them  i gotta got to get in touch with uh  benjamin and see what's uh breath and see if  i can get some more of those labels cos i can't seem to find them  those diskette labels can't seem to find them anywhere so   so there it is  but uh but uh what was my point of this  so i made those and oh yeah okay   word   s so i dropped by uhh pricewaterhouse name of accounting company today and i was by the mailroom and i just i just knew jolene  's extension so i punched her up and uh she goes hello and i said hey yo  j what's up and laugh and there was just this pause  i'm like jolene yeah it's richard i'm at the mailroom she's like oh like laugh   laugh   it was like you know it was uh  so i just said do you want me to take and uh leave this  you know just leave this envelope or do you have time to come down and she said she was busy so i just put it in an envelope  laugh she probably after that comment she probably couldn't face you you know  put one of   laugh exactly  that richard dawson i don't know he's a bit weird  dontcha don't you think   it it's he he's a he's   got that black lingo you know he talks that way  but uh i don't know i don't know i just i'm just gonna going to try and be sickeningly nice to jolene and just you know i just won't care even if she's   if you're sickeningly nice to her that's probably going to irritate her even more  that's the key  no but i mean like even if she's snotty i'm just  gonna going to be really nice but i'm not  like i'm just gonna going to be short and just say here take this to pedro oh you have something for me good i'll be nice and pleasant and everything like that and if she's not nice back well you know i i'll i i'll i won't be talking to her long enough to really notice you know  yeah  and i and at the end if she wants to be nice then fine you know  if she doesn't then you know well what can you do  no it's a good policy   because if she is deliberately trying to be mean on the off-hand chance then your pleasantness is gonna going to  drive her crazy  yeah because i'm just not you know   whatever she says i'm just you know   be like yeah okay fine you know not gonna   going to be uh not gonna going to  be affected   but no i don't think she goes out of her way to be mean i think she's just not a  no yeah  she not a happy dancing person by nature so  which is too bad   laugh   so anyway business went pretty well today actually  i talked to this guy the guy who's makes the decisions on this he came  i went to see james and james said oh i'll show it to john when he gets back and john came in so i showed it all to him and explained it all to him and everything like that  he's in league with four stores cos he's moving his place right now he's getting another store in laval i think and he's also getting together with a company that has two stores themselves   so uh the next time we talk i mean he says you know  the next time we talk uhh probly probably   i'll get you to bring up like twenty twenty-five copies   so you know as a start i'm like hee hee there we go this is you know this is what we need
