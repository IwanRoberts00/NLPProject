 now i didn't know where  where did he go  what's he up to  now occasionally you see stuff in the journals  right  and he ended up in turkey and he's teaching at this  selfend university  now apparently they've been getting some good faculty out there  mh hmm   the guy that used to be the uh uhh head of the uh finance group at the university of ottawa a rihad tunis uh when he left ottawa he went to texas for the big bucks  huh   so then he was at the university of texas-austin  for se for many years but he's also gone gone to this this school in turkey  so apparently they must have a lot of money in turkey these days  i don't know where it's coming from cos they've  got so many people and they're  where it's coming from ya   they're supposed to be the grocer of the world but right  try to make a living selling groceries  i mean you got to produce oil i guess  groceries and kebabs laugh   anyways uh he's got a chapter in here that uh looks at  splining and it's sort of the first sort of critical paper or  critical chapter saying that well splining can  doesn't always give you the results that you want or   that that are the correct results  mhh   uhm so well you want to talk about the shortcomings of everything huh but you could refer to to  this as uhm some new work that's going the opposite direction  that with splining you're over-fitting and uhm you're not  gonna going to have uh you're not going to get the the the correct results   in uh  or if you make type a lot of type two  errors you're going to be uh accepting the null hypothesis when it's false  mh hmm  so i g i guess we should take a look at this but at the same time uh how wha   have have you done the splining too  the the approach that we took yet or  so so what is it  no i haven't done that much   uh i mean we could try doing what  try garching it or or   ya well i i mean and  there's there's there's there's a lot of different permutations we can do on de rosa  uh huh   and that's cough i guess that's sort of more the most  important uh part is that the or for me is that the   contribution the empirical duration uhm coming up with a way of refining the de rosa  uh huh   i mean there's you know the rolling regression is one way which makes a lot of sense to me  uh but that's really i guess just a testing issue  i mean the splining is may have some problems but at the same time nobody's looked at  the the potential problems of splining with this particular problem  mh hmm   right   and the uh the  other discussion the other possible approach is this the  two factor discussion the two factor price elasticities which he shows that well what you gotta have got to do is add up the coefficients  if you add up the coefficients you end up getting uhm   better better numbers or more reasonable numbers uhm than if you just go for a   mh hmm   so he he says well look at the sensitivities relative to a short-term euro as well as a long-term  bond  mh hmm   okay   and so there's two sensitivities there  and then you get a ah a better fit   ver versus your ordinary way of measuring  uhm   that makes a lot of sense too  ya i like that cos like you said you really notice a big difference when the yield curve is flattening and the ten year is rallying but short rates aren't and if you compare duration with  cos all of these durations are based on parallel moves and that is never the case   ya see this is non - parallel interest curve shifts and uh  so that's the story   so that's all in here   okay what   now how what would be a  a good path to build on that though  that's all here   like i i'm presuming that obviously i can't uhh   ya but you can say the these are the fits that you're getting  you're fo you you   go with the two factor model as  as opposed to a   a large factor model but you   you're going for a two factor right what the heck  is is the duration  really  mh hmm   and the word   mh hmm   i mean the the standard duration d p over p is alpha plus beta times the d i sort of thing the interest rate  right   and that's the interes interest   word   and then just one interest rate  so we're saying got two interest rates we can say well this is the duration it's the coefficient of d i is the duration  mh hmm   so we got two of these things  well what exactly is th the  duration right  is it a linear combination and what kind of a linear combination  right   i'm not too sure   a few words trying to interpret uhm   so you can say well you've got a really clean way to interpret it  ya   you could say well d i you can take as as  the average interest rate change  right  right  so the long and the short the so take the   average of that and that  mh hmm   but ya okay  but it's not that same  it's not the same   hmm  okay   so that's the strategy right  you you lay it out and you organize  you you organize it and you sit down and you do nothing else   for for two weeks in a row and   right uhm keep me informed sort of every couple of days where where it's at  word it   right okay   uhm okay  uh so maybe what i'm gonna going to do then is draw up a battle plan of the amount of time i can spend or  or when i can get the time the two weeks  it'll probably be   well i mean this is the story  right now better pronounced 'batter' plan or no battle plan i wanna want to see kind of a introduction and literature review one week from today  right  okay   uhm actually i can even probably spend the weekend doing this uhm cos i've got most of the papers uhm  and that'll put it together  so you get all the papers together   right   uhm add em them to here and sort of get that phase done  so that's that's the deadline one week from today  okay  i'll try and make it a little shorter uh or sooner even if i can  so probably the two weeks off would be or the two weeks i could do it uhm i'm hoping will be the since i'll be in new york  starting thursday it'll probably be be   the following monday   uh but that being said i think this i can still do   or or i might get   this you gotta have got to do  this you gotta have got to do regardless  i mean you say you're going to set up the total battle plan  exactly   okay  here's the problem let's identify the problem  right   mh hmm   okay  which means jeez it's gonna going to  be a hectic time  i you're gonna going to be on the road there at at g d a 's expense  is that the story that you're st   staying they're putting you up in a hotel and all that stuff   that's correct  ya   flying me down and everything fancy restaurants and all that   where you staying   uhm i don't know the name of the place actually  i haven't uh   probably not too fancy is my guess   well bring me back a black and white cookie   laugh from new york   laugh   that's the the the good  stuff that's   the good st stuff     black and white cookies   actually i sent tim stark there on a mission once to bring me back a black and white cookie and he couldn't find em them or he went to the wrong neighbourhoods and got them this these  italian cookies that weren't right  laugh   but if you know a new yorker they know what a laugh black and white cookie is  laugh   a black and white   it's just it's very new york  have you have you heard of the uhm what do they call him the soup nazi   the   ya on seinfeld  ya  apparently he's like a real   i guess is a word   he exists   he's a real person word   ya   anyway life imitates seinfeld  i'm not too sure you wanna want to do that   i'll see if i can find that guy too  laugh   but anyways you're going to be busy  ya   the the important thing in new york city is that you do your business and you don't look at people cos if you stop to observe the view you'll get mugged   laugh   laugh   right   that's my big worry  i've never been there before so   a few words it's cos  it's very it's a fast moving city  ya  it's too fast moving and that's the story is really uhm  keep your head up  ya   i was a victim there several years ago and it wasn't pleasing to go to the hospital  all this blood  and it's just they just wanted to make me bleed these guys  and uh that's what happens when you just sort of stop to to observe the traffic here  uncomfortable laugh hmm   right  so go there  you have a mission to go there and that's to stay alive laugh and get  out a few words   that's it   laugh sounds like a fun city laugh     take cabs if you can  ya  i often take the metro too  it's not such a bad system there  mhh okay  so what else is doing   cough   uhm on the trip you mean or just in general  ya   uhm i'm going to washington but my or   my boss is going to the shadow open market committee   meeting  uh huh   uhm and i'm just uh basically i'm   gonna going to be along for the ride just to see washington about three words   uh huh   so that'll be uh and that's it   so thursday friday saturday and i'll be back  word   ya i'm supposed to go to washington too  uh i was in invited down to the securities and exchange commission to give a talk and i m might be going down in  sniff in april   mh hmm   i like washington  i've never been there either   oh ya   laugh too much word   well you got to do the smithsonian museum when you're there and the the holocaust museum is really impressive and sort of being to different museums like that i could say mumbled words the one in washington is something that they really did ah an authentic job  on and it's a  right   well i've been to some of the or the  concentration camps in germany  i was at uh dachau   ya   i think it was dachau but   ya   phrase   well this this one gives you sort of an an american perspective of okay this is what they were doing in the states while it was  happening to and  just complete in indifference   uh huh   okay   and you see the original documents of uh the leaders in the states just   you know it was blatant  mh mhh  they were ready to blatantly participate in   in the murder that was going on  all right   anyways where do we got here on the markets today  they were down i saw  word was down about four points earlier on   uhm yield curve steepening   uh you know the two year's down ten ten  bibs i think today   uhm actually there's a huge ah rally bond rally  the long bond was doing well and then uh because  there was a ahh durable goods orders or something  uh huh   you probably don't remember off hand  well  anyways and it had just got erased  i think like the bond market's ready to start backing up   now anyways   where is it now   we can check out exactly where the market is  is happening  that network and i want nets  right there   there it is down there  get the uh p c close about two words    three or four words  about a fifteen minute delay on some of these things and  a few words   ya   do you trade the stock market now
