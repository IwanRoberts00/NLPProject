 but no matter what side of the tracks you're from our attitudes towards consumption will have to change to create a sustainable world  cameron weis is the university of british columbia researcher who invented the idea of the ecological footprint  it's a method of measuring humanity's impact on the earth  rees says that confusion about sustainable development is a consequence of our failure to distinguish between true development and mere growth  economist hubert neely defines growth  as an increase in size through material accretion and development  as a realization of fuller and greater potential  this is a very important distinction  as weis says growth means getting bigger while development means getting better   bob tatar believes humanity can chart a more sustainable path to the future but that it will happen only through social evolution and not through technological or scientific advancements  i began by asking bob tatar what sustainable development means to him  speech, 2 min   essentially bob tatar's describing a decision making process  if something we do today takes choices away from our children or if the land's productive capacity is reduced then a decision is not sustainable  sustainable develpoment is therefore not a question of whether it's better to consume more or less  it's a question of quality versus quantity  speech, 1 min 30 sec   to bob tatar we aren't sustainable today because we're afraid to ask the right questions  speech, 40 sec   tatar says creating a sustainable future depends on western society undergoing a period of social evolution  speech, 2 min   tatar says the secret of sustainability lies in people getting back to building quality relationships in close-knit communities  we need to get back the basic human value of valuing each other says tatar and we need to understand that a community is a reciprocal relationship between people and their landscape  that's it for our feature report  next week bob tatar returns to talk about how scientists with feelings just might help create a more sustainable world  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends  a design breakthrough in australia could make solar power competitive with coal-fired electricity in five to seven years  according to the worldwatch institute the university of south wales has designed a solar cell that is twenty-one point five percent more efficient than conventional cells   this could cut the cost of solar power generation by as much as eighty percent  meanwhile world shipments of conventional photovoltaic cells the thin silicone wafers that convert sunlight into electricity jumped by seventeen percent in nineteen ninety-five  that's the largest percentage increase in more than a decade and a signal says the institute that the industry has overcome the slowdown experienced in the early nineteen nineties  the united states led the way in nineteen ninety-five with a twenty-five percent increase in domestic purchases of solar cells and a forty percent increase in exports  japanese shipments of solar cells also grew by sixteen percent in nineteen ninety-five  sales were mostly domestic and nearly all of the growth was accounted for by the government's seventy thousand roofs project an ambitious plan to install home rooftop units  solar power may hold great potential for a sustainable future but today it still only accounts for one one hundredth of one percent of the world's electricity  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   bob tatar has testified written spoken and promoted awareness and understanding of old growth forests all over the planet  he and his former coleague gary rankin were the two key scientists behind the popularization of old growth forest ecology in the pacific northwest of the united states  if you know about the spotted owl it's partly because of their work  never before has a species of wildlife become such an icon of sustainability as the spotted owl  bob tatar lives in corvallis oregon where despite having written more than half a dozen books he still answers his own phone books his own interviews and speaks passionately about the earth and its people  today we talk to bob tatar about scientists with feelings economics with debits and staying inspired in a troubled world  bob tatar abandoned a twenty year career as a research scientist because he became frustrated by how science was being used to answer social questions  he became uncomfortable with the notion of scientists divorcing themselves from their feelings in an attempt to be purely intellectual  tatar's been consulted by first nations in canada's arctic  he's testified on behalf of old growth forests in ontario  and he's been all over the world  he's influenced the thinking of thousands of people  the reason is perhaps simple  he's passionate about life  he's passionate about ecology  and he's passionate about getting beyond conflict to a bold new sustainable world  speech, 3 min 10 sec   it's true that arrogance sometimes accompanies knowledge  at one time it seemed obvious the world was flat and that the sun revolved around the earth  that was the state of the art at the time  but nature is a little more complicated than that and tatar  warns our desire to manage nature could threaten human survival  he also takes aim at technology like the internet that tends to isolate us from each other  speech, 1 min 20   tatar believes a little social evolution would not only create healthier and happier people but it would also help solve environmental and economic problems as well  it's hard not to become depressed when you consider such weighty issues as the environment the exploding population and the many social and economic problems that confront us today  i asked tatar how he keeps motivated and how he keeps writing books one after another  speech, 1 min 50 sec   what does your garden look like   response, 50 sec   tatar says if you're concerned about creating a sustainable world you should start by asking yourself what sustainability means to you  he suggests ask yourself what is the gift you have to offer your neighbour  then go over there introduce yourself and begin rebuilding a sustainable community  that's it for our feature report  if you're interested in bob tatar's ideas you might want to check out his new book called sustainable environment development  from saint harry press   however i would also recommend you consider looking up one of his previous books called forest beginnings   it's a beautiful book that juxtaposes ecological and human history through the four thousand year life of a pacific northwest old growth forest  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's kim alesko with this week's ecofacts and trends  world wind power generating capacity grew by an amazing thirty-three percent in nineteen ninety-five according to preliminary estimates from the worldwatch institute  although the united states still leads the way with a total installed capacity of sixteen hundred and fifty megawatts that capacity has not increased since nineteen ninety-one  by contrast germany added five hundred and five megawatts of capacity in nineteen ninety-five the most any country has ever installed in a single year  after the u s germany has the second highest wind power generating capacity followed by denmark and india  the biggest growth area is in europe where financial incentives and high purchase prices have been established for renewable energy  according to the worldwatch institute the incentives are a response to european concern about atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel-fired power plants  in europe the technology is improving quickly as markets develop  unlike the wind farms that were developed in places like california european wind power is being generated by large capacity wind machines installed one or two at a time across the rural landscape  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm kim alesko   they're everywhere  when you walk down the aisles of your favourite gardening or hardware store in spring the pungent odours hit you with their distinctive unpleasant aroma  that aroma could be making you sick  that's the contention of doctor jane ewing a dermatologist from hudson quebec who's been looking into pesticide toxicity problems in humans for more than a decade  she began looking into the ill effects of pesticides in nineteen eighty-five when a patient became inexplicably ill  since then she's been working hard up against what she calls a conspiracy of silence  on today's program we'll talk to doctor jane ewing about what she's learned and what she's done music   last summer my neighbour a guy with about as much commitment to yard care as me brought out the heavy artillery to combat a relatively minor outbreak of dandelions  i didn't see it but the next day i could smell that distinctive odour of herbicide  it was easy to see where he had sprayed  the non-grass plants started growing like crazy as they rapidly curled up and died from a good dose of poison  the problem is he couldn't have read the label very well because he sprayed the stuff everywhere in his yard killing flower beds plants and half of his apple tree  i wondered how the owner of the home felt about the apple tree getting poisoned  i wondered how much of the herbicide got into our garden which is right on the fence line  this is unfortunately a perfectly normal thing that people do every year across north america and the world  when i asked doctor jane ewing why we should be concerned about the use of pesticides in our communities her answer was simple  question and answer between a and extra-corpus speaker, 3 min   ewing says when kids play in lawns they absorb pesticides through their skin and inhale it as they breathe  it was back in nineteen eighty-four when doctor jane ewing's  interest in the ill effects of pesticides first twigged  speech, 1 min 30 sec   to doctor ewing's surprise she found there were no facilities in quebec where she could test for pesticides and other poisons  this is despite the fact that the world health organization reports that there are three million pesticide poisonings every year around the world  estimates are that two hundred and twenty thousand deaths occurred in nineteen eighty-nine alone  since nineteen eighty-seven doctor jane ewing has spent more than twenty thousand dollars of her own money sending blood samples for more than eighty of her patients to accu-chem laboratories in richardson texas  speech, 1 min   so how can research even be done in canada if we can't even test for the chemicals   response, 20 min   ewing says scientists now believe that seventy to ninety percent of all cancers are caused by exposure to the suite of chemicals now in use by humans  in a world stressed at the seams chemical herbicides and other pesticides are promoted by some as a method of achieving a sustainable future  ewing thinks human health would be a lot more sustainable without them  with no labs in place to test for the toxic pesticides it means there is no record from which to research their effects  doctor ewing felt it was her duty as a physician to keep her town council aware of what she was learning about the effects of pesticides on health  speech, 1 min   it was a startling achievement  as a consequence of doctor ewing's letters and the actions of local citizens hudson quebec took the unprecedented step of banning pesticides  two chemical producers subsequently contested the hudson bylaw but lost in the quebec superior court  almost immediately the town of hudson was besieged with phone calls people asking for copies of the bylaw and the judgement  since then eighteen other quebec communities have passed pesticide bylaws although none are as sweeping as the law in hudson  just what did doctor ewing tell her town council  speech, 2 min   doctor ewing is alarmed by both the fact that facilities do not exist to properly test patients for pesticides and that such potentially dangerous substances are used so casually across canada  speech, 1 min 30 sec   doctor ewing has written to various canadian health ministers to warn them about the harmful effects of pesticides and to convince them to make testing facilities available in canada  most recently the honourable david dingwall wrote her back and indicated the government was working with chemical companies to reduce the use of pesticides  but as doctor ewing says that's a little like asking a smoker to cut down instead of quitting   that's it for our feature report   you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here's this week's ecofacts and trends   the global wind energy potential is about five times the current global electricity appetite  generating electricity with the wind is considered one of the best ways to combat global warming since there're almost no environmental side effects
