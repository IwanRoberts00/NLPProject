 oh it's okay you know laugh fifty percent off for you and  a few words mumbled not me  if you're too nice you'll have problems being an entrepreneur  you have to have that profit motivation  you have to everything you do is worth something    you have to have a price tag associated with it  otherwise you become too benevolent and end up laugh  going out of business   what do you think are the key skills for entrepreneurs  if you're about three words what would you say would be the key skill for an entrepreneur   the number one above all   give it a shot  mh hmm  answer   motivation sure  passion or desire  ya no definitely i mean that that's way above anything else  just the the sheer desire will carry you  in other words if you aren't driven then you might as well  comment   perserverance determination willing to stick to it over all the obstacles and hurdles  and there'll be plenty of them  that's another key trait or characteristic  in terms of skills uh like uh you know if you have a skill an ability to do something ah a learned ah  that's that's an attitude if you will  you know those those are attitudes   answer   huh  repeats   communication  networking sure  and an an extension of that is  selling  cos that's what selling is is communication  and basically that's been found to be the premier skill  for entrepreneurs  if you can't sell then you'll have to get somebody that can cos nothing happens until somebody sells something  so you can have the greatest product in the world you can have the best mousetrap you can have excellent ideas but unless somebody goes and buys them you don't have a business   so number one you need sales  and so uh many ah artisian entrepren  entrepreneurs you know artisan entrepreneurs who are very good at woodworking or some type of craft they have a problem because they make beautiful products but they can't sell em them   they don't have the skills of selling  so ah in sales you can see like uh anheuser-busch he started   in s in ah sales ah selling brooms  about four words big things   bic ah ah marcel bich of bic pens ah started his career by selling flashlights door to door  uh dr scholes uhm he was selling uh uh uh uh word  or an arch support  a few words be a salesman  heinz ketchup he had he he made  money selling his own bottled horseradish to local grocers   mary kay   and uh coleman camping equipment uh he was a travelling typewriter salesman  so it really is the communication skills uh related to uh  word   and selling is very  i mean anybody can sell  the key is credibility and trust   you all have to have ah an ah ah an  enjoyment of working with people and credibility and trust and basically then anybody can sell   since we were on that track i'm going to run you by  some things here that  you you've been feeling that one of the top  perserverance remember you were say you were saying that pererverance or determination is a key characteristic of somebody going into business for themselves   let's categorize it  would you call that a skill  a sk skill a gift is something that you can't learn  it's inher inherited   you know it's kind of like a a  proteg&eacute; or uh uhm someone who uh is is born  with a gift  you're born with a gift  a skill is something you can learn  and an attitude of course is a feeling or something internal   uhm so well you you can start back  with perserverance  how would you label perserverance audience responds   attitude   and attitude for the most part   okay   and uh there there's   what was the other one audience responds   pardon  answer   determination  okay  perserverance and determination are these interchangeable   answer   motivation okay   motivation desire passion if whatever  you want to call it you have for your business  in other words uh   answer   huh  repeats   an attitude or a passion   uhm selling the skill of selling  selling is a skill   response   yes some people have the gift of the gab laugh   phrase   question tape cuts out   so good salespeople are aware of that and so y  y y the key is you must know some people yourself who you've bought from whom you trust  when they come to you and say you know whatever they tell   you you know you believe it  ah what are some others  sure   answer   math  agrees   okay well what would that be  question   oh ya that's a definite skill   uh laugh uh you've just caught me by surprise because what most entrepreneurs do is they they would go and outsource that  like accountancy for example  you see like because of the fact it's it's   a  people are split up if they're going to do their own books  if you're going to your own accounting and and  so on and so forth  but you know what most entrepreneurs don't want to deal with finance or accounting because they want to work with their market  they're s that that in the terms of prioritizing their time to be good accountants wouldn't do them well unless they worked with their market   comment   oh do their own   mh hmm   well there's ratios and ya sure to be able to know if you're profitable or not or whether you should increase your prices or  wh what would happen if you decreased you price will you get more business and so on and so forth  ya sure for strategy  okay  uhm so uh ya sure that's definitely a skill   that's something you could you could  learn  i mean granted you may be gi you may have better mathematical knowledge than somebody else at the beginning and be more adaptable to it but nonetheless it'd be a skill  something else  answer   management in the sense that   answer   time   employees   in other words prioritize uh to be able to plan organize all of a couple words   okay  where would management come in audience response   skill for the most part  okay anybody else  some more  sure   answer   personality  okay mhh hmm  comment   uh personality would be a audience comments   it's an attitude to a certain extent  some of it is  comment   yes okay mhh hmm  some people have that natural personality   somebody else  sure  answer   being in tune with your market  okay uh  answer   knowledgeable of your market  knowledgeable of the uh other expertise in your field  type of thing  okay   comments   mhh hmm   so the so to know that you'd have to know the in the industry the business and so on and so forth  right  so that would be a audience responds   skill  sure  cos you could learn that  no matter what industry you went into you could learn uh  it over a period of time depending on how much you wanted to learn  it's as simple as that  florists   florist  when i got in to be a florist i knew nothing about florists  i word want to be a florist now   florist now   i mean now i know the traps pitfalls and everything else  i didn't realize how dependent you were as a florist on your designer   i mean i just figured you hired these people like you'd hire somebody you know off the street  your designer is your key person  most people who are florists are designers for control  i didn't know that  i didn't realize that designers were real artsy people who didn't believe in nine to five and efficiency and so on and so forth  so on the days when i'd have a lot of funerals or a lot of weddings or a lot of whatever they they they they'd   word themselves word don't feel creative today so i'm not coming in  and i'd say come in even if you're not very creative come in  no i don't feel i don't have the the  vibes i don't audience laughter   and so i'm standing there in this florist's and i'm like what do i do  i don't know how to design  you know that that's where your market  that's that's how your expertise to understand what what you need and so on and so forth   anything else   somebody else  sure  comment   team building  okay  for when you have employees  mh hmm  i'll put it over as a skill because there's definitely a  group dynamics or or the skill of being able to uh motivate people in groups and and so on  comment   uh okay  let's call it vision like visionary i e  or how do you how do you call it  how do you label that two words  seeing what everybody sees and thinking what no one has thought   that type of thing  okay creative visionary  okay  that'd be  answer   okay it's also a few words   some would argue with ya you   ah sure   ya it can be trained because in entrepreneurship one of the first things i do in every class is to get people to be sensitive to business opportunities  like an entrepreneur  uh laugh when i used to have them come in to do a class  on the way to the classroom they'd find five business opportunities with  word credit   they'd come in and say how come nobody saw that how come nobody saw this  and i just stood there going ya laugh   like every day you pass by must be a couple of dozen business opportunities   question   ah well that's that's the next phase   that would be putting the o o  opportunity into practice  then you have to do some research  then you have to determine whether or not the idea is feasible  that's when you get into the research phase  you find out if there's competition find out if there's a niche there's a you know and then make your plan business plan in terms of how you're going to attack that niche   but to see or perceive the opportunity it is a gift or a skill cos it can be developed  so the entrepreneurs that would come into class were teaching the students how to be sensitive to business opportunities   comment   yes  that's part of your research  comment   oh ya the the passion the personality and so on and so forth  sure  comment   kay okay you're  you're moving ahead to idea  in other words you're looking for scanning the  environment for opportunities to to take advantage of it  you will and then you're an entrepreneur is what you're  word   response   okay  well why is that   response   word an opportunity  response   you're okay okay   ya laugh if you're driven if you're driven by profit alone you'll never see the the   the viability to it  the thing is that for eve every   have you ever regretted ah an opportunity that you didn't take advantage of that ended up being very successful  do you s do you know what i'm saying  are you   response   okay   well dri driving around  like this i'm getting to determine the motivations of why you want to be in business for yourself and what you want to get out of it and so on  cos that there are many different types of entrepreneurs  some people are threshold entrepreneurs and want to build a great profit and others are quite happy just to make a nice living where they have a comfortable existence take care of their family that sort of thing  so but and it's not to say one's good and one's bad because it's just the opportunity they're looking for  the threshold-type opportunity is is  more elusive than just finding something that would be good for now  but what you might want to think of doing is stepping in at a level and then just to get the experience and then you'll be working up level by level  just get your feet wet a bit   you know you get an opportunity it may not be extravagant or it may not be  but don't forget if the idea is that great everybody else sees it too  o o oftentimes the big successes come from seeing something that nobody else has seen and therefore you get an edge you get a year's head-start before all of a sudden everybody realizes woo hey there's something to this   you know that's all they've got   ray kroc's idea  he he not everybody opened up the same day as him    ah you know it was years later  in fact his key employee naturally laugh   the best employee that mcdonald's ever had  won employee of the month all the time   always perfect on all his performance appraisals excellent employee comes in on his days off without pay to learn the business  what a super employee  that's the guy who started burger king audience laughs   but i mean you gotta have got to  expect that  if the idea is that good people are going to flock into it  and and even you might  get a head start if you're lucky but you better have the money to pour into that too because they'll just eat cash
