 this one here is carved  it was another  somebody had deeply carved and then they decorated them  okay any any questions about that   uhm alright we'll 10 second pause tape cuts out   uh alright now uhm well there's  we're into the northern renaissance in this room which came   later than the uh later than the italian renaissance and we have a number of uhm well-known  let's start over here with the memling   well-known northern renaissance uh artists  this one is is hans memling uh who was flemish and it is uh uhm the virgin and child with saint anthony abbot up here and the donor  the donor is on his knees and he is is  uhh worshipping in the presence of the virgin and the child  uh he has given a sum of money to have the painting painted uh given the money to the church  he's shown with saint anthony abbot which might mean that his name is anthony  often they chose a patron of the same name   uhm saint anthony abbot we know because his attribute is here  his attribute is a pig   and so you usually see a pig lurking around somewhere in a painting of sa of saint saint   anthony  it shows the four of them  it it shows them quite clearly  you see the the tiled floor and the virgin's throne and you even see a landscape uh out of doors  now you particularly in the north they did these detailed landscapes seen through a window or a door  but you also have the idea they're in the same space and yet they're not in the same space  if if uhm the different in the lighting  the different in the uh the uh faces  they they're no there's no uh joining of glances  they're not looking each o other  at at each other   so it's as if mary and the child are are  existing in a ah maybe an ideal or an imaginary world compared to these two who who are are are  in the real world  there's a there's a separation there  uhm the child is in has his hand  in the in the blessed position with his with his fingers up like this     question   uh maybe a symbol maybe just ah ah a word  you know a few words like the apple  maybe just just you know ah ah ah part of the picture a form of the picture   now we also have two pictures in this room by uhm lucas cranach who was uhm uhm one of the word german  artists a friend of d&uuml;rer  uhm this is one of his religious uh religious paintings uhm the ta the woman taken in adultery   and it's ju the fi   figures in the background are are  the typical german faces that seem to be almost like gargoyles  some of them are are very ugly very  well almost vicious  you see a number of them like that  but cranach also did a number of uhm erotic nudes   uh he was ah a close friend of luther   luther who started the the the  reformation  uh they were close family friends  they were godfathers to each other's children  and uhm sometimes that when you think of that it seems rather surprising that cranach would have done uh so many nudes but it's thought that it was one of the electors of saxony where he was working who had a taste for these nudes and was commissioning the work on it  cranach was uh was painting them to please him  they uh this one is called venus   they're venus  they're uh diana  they're uh eve  they they have many names uh but they are all excuses to paint uhm an erotic nude  uh they're fairly gothic  it they they're kind of straddling   the the the gothic period and the the   the renaissance  it's renaissance in that he goes to the myth  the mythology venus and and uhm diana and those sorts of things but the the the   figure is is gothic  this was a a a typical rendition   of of a beautiful woman elongated small head sloping shoulders prominent abdomen uhm   that that that is the gothic ideal  uhm she's naked except for her jewellery  and this gauzy thing that she holds around here  over over her the the  genital area up until i don't know if it's two years ago now she wore a fig leaf  she this fi figure   had a fig leaf when the gallery bought her   the the painting  and it was obvious that it had been put there not by cranach but many years thereafter by at the order no doubt of the subsequent uh owner   and after a lot of uh thought and research and examination they decided that it would be safe to remove it  they the theory with conservation is if  something is known not to be of the artist's hand and if it can be safely removed you do it  so they they did  they took uh the fig leaf off and layer after layer of  heavy yellow varnish  this picture was a different colour be when be  be before this was done  and it it did become obvious as they worked that the the fig leaf had been put on because of the layers of varnish under it there were layers of varnish over it   uhm so she she she's shown here as uhm a sort of a vapid uhm kind of expression on her face  you know there's been talk of it of it  being pornographic  she doesn't have enough s presence or enough  there's not enough to her i think to to to to   constitute uh pornography  she uh venus of course came out of the sea  venus aphrodite rose from the sea and that's indicated by  the uhm the the rocky seashore at the bottom  ah the rest of it all dark with her right on the front  you concentrate on her  and another little interesting point here is cranach's signature  his signature is uhm a dragon with the wings raised   and at some point one of his sons died and after that the wings were lowered  so you can think of cranach more or less by  whether the wings are are are up or down   okay   question   word   exclamation tape cuts out   now this uhm this is the baroque gallery  baroque is seventeenth century   and uhm it's hung in the way most seventeenth century galleries are hung with this kind of dark background  it's often a green or it's a rose like this  the pictures are hung close together  some above the others  i think this is the only gallery in the place where there are pictures hanging up above each other  because as i say this is the way they were hung  and some p paintings were meant to be hung high  they they uh they uh they'd be out of proportion if you brought them down to eye level   uhm the the baroque art  is closely connected to the counter-reformation  after luther uh objected to the catholic church and some of what he says the excesses of the catholic church and uhm brought about the reformation which led to protestantism the catholic church  organized and organized a counter-reformation and  uh to to sort of fight back  and re-establish themselves  and one of the most powerful tools they had was art because art appeals to the intellect it appeals to the senses it appeals to the emotions it can tell a story   and so the popes of this time were great art patrons  and each pope had at least one artist uh that he uh gave commissions to and that that did his work and the kind of work  and the one i'd like to look at is uh bernini the great italian sculptor uh who was uh whose patron was pope urban the eighth  uhm he uh he they had worked together  before he became pope and after that they uh they uh  did did the work that   that urban always wanted  and he he's the the  sculptor that did most of the or many of the fountains  in rome   have you ever been to rome  answer   never in rome   well if ever you go you will see that the   the fountains in piazza navona and so on these are done by bernini  the work a lot of the work in st peter's the the uh the the uh uh the at the altar the baldachin and the great curved pillars that   uh that hold the the canopy over the altar  a number of things are the work of bernini   this is uhm uhm scuplture a portrait of the pope  commissioned by the pope uh over life-size very impressive but not at all formal  if you look at it you see that it's it's   very in informal almost to the to the point of being casual  the he's not dressed up in papal regalia  he's got uhm ah a little cap on  the cap is dented   uhm there are uh waves and wrinkles across his   his uhm cape  uhm bernini is demonstrating how he can use the marble and the carving of the marble to catch the light uh and to almost make flesh look real  if you get the a certain angle here with the light on that brown on the nose it looks almost like  like like flesh  uhm he's put in wrinkles around the eyes  he's put in wrinkles around the mouth  it's not idealized at all  it's not making the pope look as good as he could  it's it's you have the feeling that this is uh is what the pope really looked like and what he  since they were almost you know on a level of friendship he would be privileged to see him like this and this is the way he's   he was depicted in   uhm one of the treasures of this gallery uh often  picked out by people you know as being uhm one of the uh of the the the the treasures  in in the national gallery 10 second pause   uh let's see one other  let's look at this one over here for something different  many of the things in here most of the things i'd say are religious because as i pointed out b b  baroque art uhm was uhm to some extent a religious art  but here is one that is uhm is not  it's quite different  this is flemish   it's called as the old sing so the young pipe and it's by the flemish uh painter uhm jacob jordaens done about sixteen forty  now this is a painting that can be looked at and enjoyed on several levels  on the face of it uhh what you see is uhm a family uh sitting around a table enjoying themselves eating drinking  it's what what might be called a genre  painting people in their own home  uh this is what genre painting is peop  people ordinary people in their own home they're living  their their their life in a natural way  so you have a feeling this is maybe the way they sit around every night ah around the table and and it's  it's very sensuous  you you you get ah ah a strong appeal to the eyes to the uh to the s  sense of smell to the taste uh even uh to the  to the ears  uhm he contrasts beautifully the the   uhm what is it copper here or brass with glass and pewter and pattern  uhm the grapes look at look how  they're painted very very realistic  you can get a lot of pleasure just picking those things out   and and looking at them and looking at the people  and you you the the   moral as the old si uh sing   so they young tijdt or whatever it is  it's you know children will do as their children do   uhm and you see it in a couple of ways here  the man playing the pipe and right under him the little boy  playing the pipe imitating the father  and over here this is not actually a pipe  i think it's sort of a pacifier but it's the same sort thing imitating the elders  uhm also i think there's the message as as   the old overeat so the young are going to do  the baby's quite quite uh small but  it's already still uhm still little it's already  quite chubby
