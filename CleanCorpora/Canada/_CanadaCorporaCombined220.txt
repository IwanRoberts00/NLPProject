 if there was a problem before and if anything had been done  and there are there is social services you know th   but you could not approach them yourself that would have to go through the school  and through nursing possibly i mean if it's really bad nursing knows as well  there's there's a nursing station in every community two or three words   they're great i'll never have such great word  service again laugh   uhm but sometimes things do happen that're are   upsetting because you do become involved in these uh communities and you know the children and you know the parents and you know what's going on and uhm  it has an upside in that you you can become really involved if you've got a child who's got a learning disability or something  the parents can be very word it's not hard to find them and it's not hard to contact them and they're usually very very  interested in trying to find a way to help their child  obviously uhm  and so in that way it can be really rewarding when you've got a situation where you're really working with the parents to help this child and you can do that  it's not just you know you have a hundred and twenty students you're an e s l specialist and oh that's that kid third row in the back you know  you know where their parents are living come from what they do after school  you know these word you see them they see you after school and you know exactly what's happening  so sniff on one hand it's a lot of fun and and it  you can really get in personal contact with the community but on the other hand it can be if there's if something   bad happens it can go very wrong  and i mean there was a stats uhh another  thing that came out in the newspaper fairly recently i think just after christmas on the the suicide rate in the north  it's it's the highest among teens it's the highest  in canada  and now in the three years i was there i was lucky in that there was only one suicide in one of the communities i was in and it was a   three or four words student  loud cough in audience   uhm but i mean when something like that happens it's just  really really really really horrendous  there's nothing   you're just totally numb through the core and and    i mean that's to say it knocks the whole community out of the water as well and sniff   there's nothing to say that that will happen but it's   it is a possibility  it does happen  and when you're in a small community it's just the shock is is just horrendous  especially if it's one of your students about 8 seconds of quiet muttering and loud noises   it's just a horrible thing  but it's someth it's a reality  that four words   what do we do  where do they go  there's only so much that they can do word   school is one of the only things that they have to do and lord knows laugh that's not always a lot of fun to them  motivation in secondary is three words  laugh   university topic  audience member starts to comment   audience member asks a question   fairly seldom   uhm very seldom actually  usually teachers will stay in one place for for  a length of time   uhm sometimes it depends like two of my friends who came up when we were teaching in kuujjuaq they came up on materni t   to cover for a maternity leave  well when that person came back that job wasn't there anymore  so they went to another community that needed a teacher  happened to need a teacher at christmas right at the same time that the other teacher was coming back  so th they moved really quickly and then later on went back so   so things can happen and you can reque  request a transfer if you want to  if you feel you want to try out  if you're in a big place and you might not word  working in a small place or vice versa  if you get there  but it doesn't happen all that often  there's some teachers just wanna want to  teach in a school three words   and it gets easily fifteen if not seventeen years  easily that long  and she's been in a number of communities because after three or four years in the same community you kinda kind of  feel like you want a change  but she still wants to stay at the word so she's gonna going to hafta have to four words   but i think she's the only person i know that has laugh   the word can travel to most places but   you will get to travel   you get to travel but   every two years we have word days in kuujuak and everybody and his dog not quite uhm come to kuujuaq and we have five panicked could be panic days of of   of workshops and stuff  and everybody all gets together so  if you have the laugh starts two or three words  do the whole coast laugh ends all the way around which is well it's twelve villages by the time you get up  laugh starts word you'll be glad to see the ground again laugh ends but that way you get to see the other villages  at least from there  sometimes the things that happen   audience member asks a question   yeah i think it probly probably is harder cos i went up with marcus so for me it wasn   i didn't have that problem   uhm   mind you i was the person that everybody said like all of our friends thought starts imitating someone else's voice five words you're such a city girl ends voice imitation   i mean we're going to the village of a hundred and twenty people right  i've never lived anywhere smaller than montreal right   you know laughs with audience   so it really was kinda kind of predicted that i would find this really tough right but who wouldn't  you see your first year  i have a photo somewhere here that i i i guess i  bring this  i didn't bring all of our photo albums just because  th you wouldn't believe me  but i'll pass it around sniff   this is crossing the s   this blue building over here is the school and i'm about to walk out my front steps   and this is coming home for the weekend  i'll pass those around  those aren't presents from home i'm carrying guys these are called books laugh   so mmm  specially especially in primary my god  i don't remember too many weekends i wasn't working or preparing things  but in a way i mean it sounds grim but in a way it's fun too  because you have the s you can have   your own class you can do whatever you want  i mean there are programs there are things that  that you have to follow but nine out of ten you need to supplement in a big way  and also it's your place to to to put whatever you want on the walls  to to come in in primary   word   audience member comments   exactly yeah  you never know where you're gonna going to   be and so you kinda kind of get gung-ho too  and also until you've figured out which way is up which i wrote off the first year i figure  but at least the firs you know at least till christmas you're really not  aah it's word like what's goin   going on and how to cope and laugh   you're really really busy uhm   so you really y   well you have a lot of free time technically because you don't have you aren't taking buses anywhere you don't have to commute  there's no transit time here  you're still  i don't know a fir first year teacher that didn't just say oh my god laugh i never realized how much work it would be  audience member asks a question   judging by the length of my hair which probably october  laugh   and the fact th th that there's  a bit of snow but not much snow  yeah i'm still word   audience member comments   audience member asks a question   the school's are very well supplied  audience member comments   but in saying that you know they're very well supplied with basic things  and if you have a great desire to do art projects with  with you know papier m&acircumflex;ch&eacute; well no you could probably even find papier m&acircumflex;ch&eacute; stuff  uhm generally they're very well supplied  they're they're usually you'll have your own projector in class  audience memeber comments   and it's really uhm uhm  it won't be there you'll have to go get it from the a v room  audio-visual room at the beginning of the year  but you'll have like you know a tape recorder with as many headphones as you need  uhm paper pencils are all supplied to the students so there's lots of that  and otherwise you just arrive on time and have two or three words pencils  word laugh   but thr and there are materials  i j i js i i didn't know   what to bring so i just sort of threw a whole bunch of stuff in my bag but  i didn't really bring  audience member comments   i brought a fruit word for the polar bear  and i got a unit on one of the ecology secondary one units that you guys can come look at  this one just blows me right out of the water  this is my idea of pure hell  teaching logic and set theory in secondary format laughs with audience   and it's a really goo   this this program came out last year  our my my two words  in in secondary math wrote this unit  and i think it's wonderful bec   as as a language teacher it's wonderful  the first thing the first chapter chapter one sentences  and everything is equating math with sentences like uh  uh and and stories and  and the problems are you have a sentence and you have to translate it into a math kind of thing like uhh determine the truth   of of these things  oh uhh well i'll let you look at it later because  laugh can't start in the middle and laugh   quiet muttering and i don't really know what i'm saying either so end quiet muttering   but it's it's a wonderful wonderful thing  so you  there are things out there i mean there are we have for seventeen years been working our little tail feathers off trying to create materials  aside this is grade five math book end aside   uhm but and word produces  we have our own printing facilities and we produce all of these things oureslves so they're you know they're not really all that expensive   uhm and we have some really i i brought some  of the inuktitut books cos i really like them  i have no idea start laugh what this book is about guys  end laugh so don't ask me what it's about but it's really pretty  laughs with audience   and it's in syllabics  i thought it was really nice  word about stories  now this i can just guess it's about this little girl you know  and it's and these are things that we produced ourselves so  at the board   so so there are things there but just sometimes they're not as much as you need  or when you get to your class and  like my first year i had grade five six seven split  i had one kid who was grade five three three two  two grade sixes and ten grade sevens  i think that's how it worked  yeah because like thirteen and then seven eight nine great  but i discovered very quickly those grade sevens could  couldn't even do the grade six math book  so i had to suddenly launch them back into grade five math  which was a bit of a trauma for them of course but  not not not as much of a trauma as it was for me to realize that aaahh they're not at the level they're  sposed supposed to be  what am i sposed supposed to do here  so you c i couldn't follow absolutely everything that was in the grade five math book cos i didn't want them to feel like babies  and so i was makin making math sheets  audience member comments   word machines  you know tesl people are the only people i've found in the north that know how to work a word machine  cos most of their programs don't seem to even entertain the thought that you might find one anywhere  we still have those in the north and they work wonderfully  just covered in purple ink and yeah yeah  so i made a hundred and a thousand and   one math sheets  i can't think of  the math sheets i have been making for so long i don't ever   wanna want to see them again  so this is it  you've got stuff there you've got the bones generally but   and especially if it's something you don't know a lot about like  you know science class was not my idea of a grand time  cos a lot of the time i just couldn't figure out what it was they were aiming us at  and there're a lotta lot of tho  everything's very hands on uhm specially the math program  the math program has  there's a room in every school a small room in every school for the math supplies
