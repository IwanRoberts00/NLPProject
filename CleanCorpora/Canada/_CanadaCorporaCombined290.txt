 tape starts mid sentence and she was one of the early women graduates from trinity college in toronto in eighteen eighty-eight  at a time when male physicians were predicting that higher education for women weakened developing wombs and produced disorders such as infertility the inhibition of lactation in nursing mothers serious mental disturbance and pelvic distortion presumably from sitting too much  crowd laughter   in eighteen ninety-one undaunted clara brett martin presented a formal petition to the law society of upper canada for admission as a student at law  this is the first record we have in canada written record i emphasize that of a female applicant  which is not to suggest that there weren't women before her who desired to go and who may have made informal enquiries  this is our first written record  the benchers of the law society rejected her application in the first of what would be a series of law society votes against her admission  the canada law journal put it succinctly  quotation   it would take two separate statutes of the provincial parliament  lobby forces mounted by very very prominent women in the community such as emily stowe the first white woman doctor and lady aberdeen the wife of the governor general and the founder of the national council of women of canada and six more years before clara brett martin would finally achieve success  during her articling experience she was described by fellow students as a very odd sort of woman a rebel and in later years as a queer old duck  she survived taunting hissing and classroom sexual harassment equivalent to that experienced by emily stowe one of the first women doctors  she also survived unprecedented media attention  her first courtroom appearance was followed by a bevy of reporters concerned above all with her appearance her voice inflection and her facial tone  now those of you who've appeared in court for your first time already will know what it's like to walk into a courtroom   can you imagine walking into that courtroom as the first woman  with a hoard of newspaper reporters at your toes  this is one of the reports that was written  quotation   clara brett martin went on to develop a successful practice centring upon wills real estate and family law  women lawyers howl with laughter when they hear this because that's still where women practice   she rarely went to court  one is not surprised   she hired a number of female articling students  she gave fre frequent lectures to women's organizations on issues of women and law  she wrote extensively for the national council of women of canada criticizing the paternal rights in child custody the double standard of sexuality in law and the legal disabilities of married women  she lobbied for female suffrage and for separate women's courts  she was elected as a school trustee and she ran for the position of alderman in nineteen twenty   she died in nineteen twenty-three at the relatively young age of forty-nine of a heart attack   now within the past year and a half we have had a monumental discovery because until this time all efforts to trace clara brett marin's diaries journals correspondence personal and business files have failed  however within the past year and a half a p h d history student named peter sibenik who was researching files in the archives of the ontario attorney general going through countless letters received by the ontario attorney general in the early twentieth century came across a letter from clara brett martin  now this is one of the only surviving letters remaining from clara brett martin's practice  and this letter indicates that clara brett martin may have been a proponent of sex equality but she was also capable of fairly ugly forms of discrimination  the letter she wrote in nineteen fifteen to the ontario attorney general accused jewish realtors of transferring proper title  property titles improperly   i'm going to quote two or three lines of this  anybody who'd like to look at the full letter i have ah the full contents of it with me which you can see after  but the lines which capture the flavour went as follows  quotation   now this is one letter and one of the first questions that i'd been asked when i'm making this speech is can we make any assessments on the basis of one letter  and i think that's a difficult question to answer  i think that it is safe to say that on the basis of this one letter we can make an assessment that clara brett martin was anti-semitic   on the other hand this past week i received a correspondence from gladys kroech from the university of toronto which suggests that it is difficult to be conclusive in the face of one letter  and i'd like to read to you from a letter which she sent me written to her by robert gordon and dated november twenty-eighth nineteen ninety   it writes he writes i have been reading with some interest recent reports of clara brett martin and certain anti-semitic remarks which she reportedly made   quote continues   now we got first late-breaking news about a jewish legal secretary and bookkeeper   now i think that alters our record somewhat but not completely  i don't think memories positive memories from a jewish secretary and bookkeeper are going to completely override a clearly expressed form of anti-semitism in a nineteen fifteen letter but i think it signals  very importantly to us that matters of discimination are complicated and that people are not all one or the other  none of us is free from discrimination and none of us is completely malevolent and i think that sets the context for my remarks today   canadian society and the legal profession was riddled with anti-semitism throughout the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century  in the first decade of the nineteenth century ezekiel hart a merchant from the small jewish community in trois-rivi&egrave;res was elected twice to represent his riding in the quebec legislative assembly  both times he was declared ineligible to sit because he was a jew  interestingly it was one of his m family  members a descendant of ezekiel hart who became the first jewish lawyer called to the bar in the two canadas reference to upper and lower canada some years later   by the eighteen eighties and nineties pogroms in russia and romania caused several thousand jews to immigrate to canada and incidents of bigotry began to increase  goldwin smith who in the nineteenth century was the darling of the canadian intelligentsia was characterized as an arch jew-bater and bitter anti-semite by the jewish times  writing in eighteen eighty smith proclaimed that jews were an abhorrent tribe anti-social and immoral  henri bourassa the french canadian parliamentarian defended the russian pogroms of nineteen oh five arguing that jews brought it on themselves through deception and exploitation  in nineteen hundred the toronto weekly sun clamoured to prohibit immigration of polish jews  no invasion could be worse it wrote claiming that polish jews were corruptors of the community  in nineteen oh four the ottawa free press protested the immigration of russian jews a group it described as having drained the miserable purses of careless russian peasants through usury and extortion   in the nineteen twenties and thirties vast sectors of the economy were completely closed to jews  banks insurance companies department stores universities and large industrial corporations refused to hire jews  there were no jewish judges and most law firms also refused to hire jewish members  bora laskin could not find a job in nineteen thirty-seven when he returned to toronto from harvard law school  a brilliant legal scholar with two master's degrees to his credit he was consigned to write head notes for a law publisher at fifty cents a note   now the question you're going to be asking yourself is is historical context an excuse  does it excuse clara brett martin's letter to know that she was surrounded by anti-semitic rhetoric and bigotry   is it possible to argue she was merely a product of racist discriminatory intolerant times  now the typical historical answer to this is yes   my answer is no   class discrimination anti-semitism racism ableism heterosexism and other forms of bias have made the lives of many members of oppressed groups an unmitigated hell  clara brett martin must have known that and if she didn't she should have   throughout these years in addition to the bigots there were people battling discrimination  jews and other religious minority groups were demanding freedom of religion and an end to religious racial and ethnic bigotry  there were choices to be made   clara brett martin chose to perpetrate some of the abuses not fight  them   to modernize her choices must be viewed as tragic  a woman of such insight who fought so valiantly against the forces of oppression in many aspects of her life who paid the price of ostracism ridicule and undisguised hostility for her work reveals herself as partially riddled with bias in some other aspects of her beliefs and practices   now to move to a modern perspective the present debate seems to focus on how we today in contemporary times should respond to information revealing tragic deficiencies in insight of the famous heroines of the past  and i think the importance of this question cannot be overemphasized   and i offer my remarks today as the preliminary beginnings of what must necessarily be a full and lengthy debate   i also want to speak briefly about my own status in offering these remarks as a non-jew   to some degree my situation today reflecting on clara brett martin's anti-semitism reminds me of a situation of a man who comes to address an audience on how to tackle difficult issues relating to the oppression of women  we've had a lot of debate in canada over the last number of months  on the concept of appropriation of voice and who should speak on these issues  and i must say i side squarely with the group that is worried about appropriation of voice in that scholars researchers advocates who do not speak from personal experience make mistakes and i believe that  jewish women in fact should take the lead in this debate as individuals who have much deeper insight into anti-semitism and its meaning than anything that gentiles can offer  however many jewish people have suggested to me that it is not enough for us to sit back and let them take the lead on these debates that indeed they want to hear our voices in this matter  and so i'm going to speak thinking i have some impo  important points to offer and knowing that i'm taking the risk of missing essential elements in the argument and hoping that if i do jewish feminists will respond and we will all learn more   and i want to talk squarely about the concept of a heroine today  because i think the question we're grappling is what meaning significance and symbolism should we accord to women of the past   and it's very well captured to my mind in the label  heroine   are these women heroines or not   and this question is going to expand well beyond clara brett martin as more historical evidence comes to the fore about nellie mcclung's activity siding with the uh committee of citizens the one thousand citizens that attempted to strike break during the winnipeg general strike  reference to the citizens' committee of 1000 as more evidence of emily stowe the first white woman doctor's class insensitivities come to the fore  ya i mean even uh one of the most famous women from quebec history  i'm gonna going to forget her name  marguerite bourgeoys uh turns out to have been an active slave holder and uh marketer in slaves   i think that as our society struggles towards a greater sensitivity to class and race and gender disparities we're going to learn more about the mistakes of women we have cast as heroines   the search for heroines embodies an individualized history   for many of us history comes alive through people through the faces of individuals who have striven for change who've suffered who've triumphed and sometimes even failed abjectly in their efforts to improve the society around them   dictionary definitions of heroine however are highly problematic  i began with my oxford dictionary   the oxford dictionary cites heroine and refers you to heroic   heroic refers you to hero   and hero is a largely male-centred concept
