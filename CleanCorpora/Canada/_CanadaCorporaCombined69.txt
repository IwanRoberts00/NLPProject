 well i said to him look i it's   really   wow i didn't know that   ya i said look it's really important to me that we be friends and that we you know at some later date we be able to you know have breakfast or or  go to a movie or just sit and talk  have breakfast   or not run him over in the street  i just don't i just don't want anything to end badly here  i don't want there to be a crisis  i just want it to end nicely   okay so when you found out about the woman  i said okay fine  first of all i asked him if it was anyone i knew and he wouldn't tell me  he didn't say yes or no  he did didn't   he said uhm i don't want to talk about it  uh that's a good friend laugh   i said i said okay fine  gary   that's fine  i said just so long as it isn't somebody i know  oh so you and you   didn't right   and   and then i said to him now under no uncertain circumstances does this person come to the restaurant  the restaurant is off limits   and he said no you're absolutely right  i would never do that  uhm i understand completely  oh you never told me that   so you see  oh ya   so you see this is why when i found out it was her and what was going on and everything that's why   the whole issue just made me freak   but see you had no right to set limits on   well he he should have laid it out at that point  it was the perfect opportunity  cos it was underway when you had this  conversation   exactly   oh ya   he was seeing her that night  uh god  so you could have said he could have said   at this point well surprise it's tia   and i would have said okay well this is gonna  going to cause a problem  uhm we'll just have to deal with it carefully and   no you would have lost your mind   no i would have had a fit  of course i would have had a fit  i'm no one is saying i wouldn't have a fit  laugh   and i'm being totally honest  i would have had a fit right there on the phone   but then it would have been it would have been mean to g get it would have been what i would have had to do to get over it   i would have been afraid of you   ya but i would have been afraid of you if i had been gary  and he's a big coward   oh of course   he's a big coward  ya  so he wouldn't tell me the truth and instead it's like this  and so what's gonna going to happen is  i don't know  like i still don't want us to not be friends  oh jasmine why  what's uh how is he of use  to you  no no no no i mean   oh you don't wanna want to hate him  i don't wanna want to hate him  it's the history thing  it's the twenty years  it's the knowing  it's just  this is a fantasy this twenty years  you had him as a teacher in high school  ya  you did not speak to him for seventeen years and then you went out   no no that's not true   we used to we used to like have conversations everytime we bumped into each other  it wasn't there was   no it's just because of   he was never an element in your  wha if you were to list your twenty best friends gary would never have come up  cos i certainly never heard his name in six years   no no no no no of course not  but there was a period like when i was babysitting the kids  and he and i would s you know there were   a couple of times when i'd go over and we'd just sit on the back  deck and talk  ya   ya you have a hundred people like this in  your life   there were some   that's right   but there was an element  and just because of the the nasty period of time that that surrounded  ya  i just want it to all be nasty  i don't want everything   because i felt he was someone i could go and talk to when things were really not very nice  ya  and i just would like to feel in some way shape or form that  uhm something wasn't completely horrible out of that period of time  well i get that  i get it   okay but what if something what if there was not  one good thing about that time except the fact that you got out of it  oh   it just makes it more dreadful  why  i don't know cos it's such a it's   three words   but it might be the truth  well you know but in six months i may not feel this way  ya   like in six months i may just say screw it  i don't care about anything that happened back then  it's all gone now   but because everything is suddenly raw again   it's weird   ya see this phone rings is  wh what   i'm just gonna going to pause it now  recording stops for an unconfirmed time   okay we're back on again  okay good  uhm   that was a phone call laugh   laugh anyway well enough about those idiots  but anyway i'm just uh   well i thought of something when i was out uhm the more you try to manipulate it into him being in your past and if you could fix that you could fix your past the more you're  like you're trying to put  ohh i'm not trying to fix my past through him  well you're trying to see that one thing wasn't yucky about it  i'm just trying   well ya  well it's just like   i could play it back for you if you  laugh wanted me to   ya word laugh   well ya it's like i'd like to think that that  somehow you know  well i'd just like to not think that everything has been horrible  well that's easy  you can do that without him  ya  oh no i don't feel like i need   exhale it's funny  i'm becoming more and more detached from him in a way  it's starting  it's starting  i think a lot of it has to do with uh going numb on the subject  which is good cos uhm i just don't know how i mean it's just i'm starting to uh i'm just tired of it  probably three words   do you regret any behaviour   no i don't think i did anything i don't think i did anything wrong   no i was really  i was   no way  i was more honest with uh him than i've ever been with anybody  i was upfront  i made demands on him that were not unreasonable for two people in a relationship   and uh i wasn't  no  and i think that's   so you wouldn't do anything differently  no  well put it to bed then  ya i should  well i have to  i mean that's what i'm hoping to  laugh   i mean i kept thinking like did i push him  did i  no all i wanted him to do was acknowledge some level of emotional commitment so that i wouldn't be sitting around thinking well what's going on now  it's been sort of six months  it's been a year  ya it was it was the lying  and that's all  that's all i wanted to know   ya and he didn't lie with words he  ler he lied with his actions  that's right and i unfortunately allowed his actions to speak for him when i should have said gary   are you you know are you interested in pursuing this   ya   because and when i gave him     you gave up control   you grabbed control at one point  that's right   i had control and then i gave up control  like when i said are you interested in pursuing this relationship  he sai said   he would say yes   ya   and then he would say then i would say  fine uhm  and you would do the weekend attachment stuff and  then he'd back off   well are you   that's right  and and so it would be well i just didn't know how ta to how to   fit in and then i started to get angry and frustrated because i didn't want to feel like i had to fit into something  like well all of the sudden i was compromising myself  so the frustration led to the confrontations and the confrontations led to him bolting and that was it  so you know there you go  well i really like that you wouldn't do anything   that you don't regret anything   no i don't regret a single thing   talk i got so upset about about get when i got off the phone with barry 's mom i was like all of a sudden ching-ching  it was all in a row  these offensive things that she had said  these really agressive things hostile things that she had said to me and i had sat there and said uhh uh huh laugh  you know that's right   ya   and then i get off and i get all angry  so of course barry calls her back and i'm mad at  barry for three hours because he just called her back  ya  because it was his job to defend me to guess what he said that could have pissed me off to react ta   to her  in ways that was my responsibility to do  mhh hmm   ya   ya   i love this table  laugh   i wanna want to know what these nail holes are though  ya i do too  and i wanna want to know who put them here and why  and what are these little goobers  there's little naily things all the way  around   there's a circle in here   ya right around   like somebody's really like dicked around with this table  they've kind of word   well they've they've had a skirt on it or something like a vanity  inhale   oh god how awful laugh   but it's neat  i am glad i bought it and uhm it seems fairly solid  ya  i think i n i have to buy something to keep the wood happy  you know like some moisturizing lotion for wood or something so it doesn't dry   laugh   i don't know what you're supposed  i guess it's just varnish is supposed to do that but  ya  you don't know erin steen at all eh  no  you weren't she was way before you  at torrence   erin steen ya   she worked at torrence   she
