 now all these pictures that you have two words  to take into the jury room  when frank was arrested uh on the early morning hours of  november the second nineteen ninety-two uh he was instructed by myself shortly after his release uh later on that day to get into a  three words have pictures of his hands done knowing what the  allegations were against him  now the pictures of the hands ladies and gentlemen will  and i word unfortunately i don't have copies  of them but i'd like to show you  this picture on the front shows frank's two hands taken from a a position above two words  you can see on his right hand there appears to be a well-healed cut  this picture was taken about thirty-six hours after uhm frank  was arrested rest of utterance   it's dated on the third i understand about nine o'clock a few words   that scar even according to constable driscoll was well-healed word   it wasn't fresh  it wasn't bleeding at all  and the only comment that constable driscoll had was with respect to another small uh red mark or a nick maybe three words which you can see in the last picture ladies and gentlemen next to or approximately half an inch from the well-healed cut  it's very it's sometimes difficult to pick up exactly what what that is but it  it is appears to be a red mark  didn't draw blood  sentence   now it's important to look at these pictures when you assess whether or not frank wasylesko had punched raoul eto in that back hallway or punched anybody throughout this uh this  the encounter in the washroom area all the way through to the back room  firstly that little scar the one he had before the well-healed one hasn't split open you'll recall   secondly none of his there are no other bruises or indications of lacerations or abrasions on any of his knuckles left or right hand except that little tiny red nick   if he was sitting there punching raoul as  raoul eto suggests one would think that there would be open cuts  or bruises or abrasions on one or more of his knuckles  now if he is right-handed  i don't know if that's a few words   sentence   even if he was left-handed uh there's nothing to indicate on either hand that there's such a word and that cut is not uh is not split open at all  now if and and you have to  picture the back hall raoul eto is is   lying down as i understand the evidence and he suggests that he was kicked kicked and punched  constable reif has a pool of blood  not splattered on the wall not splattered on the floor but a pool   herbert wasylesko's evidence is that yes there was a pool  maybe three words dripping from raoul eto   and word and word  maybe four words raoul was brought in and and brought out  why is there no blood at all on the sole or on   on the top of the shoe of frank wasylesko not even a  word   one would think that if frank wasylesko was even holding him down while other people were kicking him there's going to be splatters somewhere on the wall or on the floor   there's gonna going to be splatters on the shoe  there's gonna going to be some objective evidence which would point to what raoul eto is saying  people would've walked at or near or in that pool of blood and there'd be footprints of blood word but there isn't  there is absolutely no evidence that that pool of blood is disturbed in any way  it would have to have been   word that raoul eto is   is getting beaten as he suggested he was there has to be some indication one or two words spread out that  there was somebody had walked in it  constable reif saw except for that pool of blood nothing else nothing else which would indicate at all uhm  that the fact that there had been this big uh beating going on in the back room  certainly when he goes in he goes in because raoul eto   three words   sentence   now here's another interesting thought   raoul eto suggests that charles is being kicked only in the midsection  not in the face not in the upper chest area not in the legs but in the midsection   can't he cover himself up with his arms   is it not more maybe two words curious   that charles' fresh cut the one that he had recently  stitched on his arm physically still healing by the way   a few words had not been reinjured a few words  quite a few words there's no bruising on the arm  and in fact raoul eto had suggested that one of the groups had actually hit his arm   two words no evidence whatsoever of bruising on charles montebank's arms or back at that particular a few words   is it not two words very convenient that  raoul eto had suggested that charles is only being kicked  word   raoul's getting it from everywhere according to himself   he was getting kicked in the head the back of the head the upper shoulder area but charles is only getting kicked in the stomach   is he suggesting three words to you that  charles was complaining about a stomach problem and therefore they would  kick on him in that area   i suggest it's very convenient that raoul eto suggests  that charles was being kicked in that area because ultimately it was shown that charles had a pancreas problem and it's easy to  say he was kicked there but there's no evidence of kicking anywhere else  there's no evidence of bruising on the ribs   there's no evidence of bruising in the upper chest area  and i already covered that  there's no evidence of bruising on the word   there's evidence of some marks on his shoulder and i believe some indication that he might have had the next day have developed a black eye  that's it  there's no evidence otherwise of any kicks or abrasions or  or bruising to the body   does that indicate  why is there no evidence  maybe three words rely on what raoul eto  says to the police  he's word beaten up two words  the police are already there  the police are there  they can they can secure it  if i was being beaten up a few words   would i not be up on my feet and saying this these  guys beat me up him him and him  nothing  nothing's said at all  raoul left   why doesn't reif notice charles montebank  bent over complaining about his stomach   there's no indication that reif three words  no indication that reif noticed anything untoward about  charles montebank   heck no indication that he even paid any attention to charles montebank   charles montebank's not complaining about his stomach  he's not yelling at the cops at all  he's not yelling at reif saying come help me my stomach's hurt or these guys hit me in my stomach   this i suggest ladies and gentlemen is not uhm it it it's not consistent with anything going on in the hallway   and if they fail ed to prove the guilt of him beyond a reasonable doubt then you must acquit  i'm now going to deal with peter four or five words   if you accept his evidence in support of   of the defence and all the other testimonies four or five words that the sexual assault i e having anal intercourse with sarah did not take place you must return a verdict of not guilty   if you do not accept the evidence in support of the defence maybe a word sexual assault did not take place but you are left in reasonable doubt by it then you must also return a verdict of not guilty even if you are only two or three words    and again what i said word roger  is equally applicable even if you are not left in a reasonable doubt by the evidence in support of the defence that the sexual assault did not take place you must still go on to determine from all the evidence whether or not the accused is guilty  in other words i again remind you that the crown must in our legal system prove each and every ingredient of the offence necessary to sustain the charge beyond a reasonable doubt  and if you're satisfied that they have then two or three words guilty  as i said earlier the crown must establish the guilt of the accused  to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and if the crown failed to prove [ 47.00] the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt then you must acquit  now i'm going to deal with the last accused and that becomes a little more complicated because there was the case against mr childs word call him  matthew is that he word or aided the other two accused   so i will now tell you about the law of aiding and abetting with respect to matthew   in this case the crown says that matthew <,. is  guilty of the offence because he aided either roger or  peter to commit the offence of sexual assault ##yes##  section twenty-one-two of the criminal code states that a person may be convicted as a party to an offence where he or she aids it says  aids and abets but abets doesn't apply in this case whether or not he or she aids someone else to commit the offence ##yes##  it is up for you ##yes## to decide whether or not matthew aided or abbetted either  roger or peter in the commission of the offence of sexual assault   therefore it is my duty to explain the law to you so that you can make this decision  first i will read section twenty-one-one in the criminal code to you and i will explain what it means   second i will list the elements the crown must prove before you are allowed to convict matthew [ 48.30] of being a party to the sexual assault by aiding roger or peter   section twenty-one-one of the criminal code reads judge reads from criminal code for approximately fifteen seconds   that section is very straightforward   it says that a person who actually commits an offence is guilty of that offence   i'll refer to that person who actually commits an offence as the  principal offender   in this case the crown takes the position that roger  and peter are the principal offenders and therefore section twenty-one-one b and c are the paragraphs that deal with aid  essentially they say that someone who aids a principal offender to commit an offence is a party to the offence  under our law a person who is a party to an offence is just as guilty as the principal offender [ 49.30]   that is really what those sections say   that if you aid the principal offender and he's guilty  then that person is also guilty   i will now tell you the elements that the crown must prove before you can find matthew guilty of sexual assault  there are three of them  the crown must prove each of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt  first the crown must prove that either roger or   peter committed the offence of sexual assault  if they're both found not guilty then that's the end of the case  as far as uh matthew is concerned   second the crown must prove that matthew did accompany and this actually aided either roger or peter  to commit the offence of sexual assault  the evidence in court here the defence evidence is that uh  that uh he didn't do it at all [ 50.30]  if you accept that or you have a reason to doubt that he didn't uh  open this girl's legs then that evidence alone you would have to  acquit #yes#  that's if you've ever if you accept  his evidence or you have a reasonable doubt whether he did it  third the crown must prove that matthew intended that his act would aid either roger or peter to commit the offence of sexual assault   the first element the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt and i mentioned that before is that either roger or  peter committed the offence of sexual assault   and of course this is if they haven't  that's the end of the case against against  matthew and you have to find him not guilty   the second element that the crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that matthew did something and that act  actually ##not rep/incomplete+complete## aided either roger or peter  to commit sexual assault [ 51.40]  now the word aid has an ordinary english meaning  that means to help or  assist   there are a number of ways in which a person can help or assist another to commit an offence   for example the aider can supply the principal offender with the instruments needed for committing the offence
