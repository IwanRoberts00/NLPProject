 india is one of the most active markets for wind power in the world today  according to the worldwatch institute by early nineteen ninety-six india had installed enough wind turbines to generate seven hundred and thirty megawatts of power  that makes india the third largest producer of wind energy in the world  more than fifteen hundred wind turbines have been installed since the indian government opened up the electricity grid to independent power producers  in the early nineteen nineties india enacted tax incentives for renewable energy investments  one of the benefits of new wind technology is power production can be combined with agricultural production in some areas  for example according to the worldwatch institute a hectare of kansas prairie that yields about four hundred dollars worth of wheat can also produce ten thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars worth of wind generated electricity each year  in alberta legislation enacted in nineteen eighty-eight allocated a hundred and twenty-five megawatts of electricity production to alternative energy producers  to date however only one hundred and eight megawatts have been allocated to wind hydro and biomass electrical power generation projects in alberta  that's despite the fact that small power producers say they have enough proposed facilities to generate a hundred and fifty-three megawatts of power  if alberta were to reach its goal of a hundred and twenty-five megawatts the province would still be generating only one point five percent of its energy from alternative sources  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm hamish lodge   i first heard about doctor dan lowe while studying forestry at the university of alberta  from other professors it was clear that k dan lowe was a forest ecologist of some note  he wrote forest places of canada the textbook describing canada's forest ecosystems  but much more than that k dan lowe is an ecologist in the true sense of the word  he's a man who spent considerable time thinking about how things work in an ecosystem or global context  when i began work on a magazine about canada's wilderness and ecology k dan lowe was an advisor stopping on every word to clarify hidden meanings and questionable ecological assumption  today k dan lowe is a retired professor of ecology living in new denver british columbia  it's been seven years since he wrote his landmark book entitled  our place in which he analyzes humanity's place in the world  then a month ago a colleague sent me an email note complete with a photograph taken just a day or so earlier  the picture was of k dan lowe getting arrested blockading a logging road in the slocan valley near new denver british columbia  interview between a and extracorpus speaker, 9 min 50 sec   doctor dan lowe is a retired professor of ecology and an author of books and numerous essays on ecological thinking  he believes that jobs are still the ticket to the political banquet known as power but that political strategies without ecological foundations will eventually collapse in on themselves  if you're interested in this topic he suggests several books  the case against the global economy edited by jerry mander and edward goldsmith  the other book is the way an ecological worldview also by edward goldsmith  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  now here are this week's ecofacts and trends   ever paused to think about where that stuff you just poured down the drain goes   that's the idea behind trout unlimited yellow fish road program   volunteers usually school children or guide and scout groups paint yellow fish on all of the storm drains in their area   the idea is to get people thinking about what goes down the drain  jay stanway of trout unlimited says in the past people have put everything from turpentine to car oil and paint down the drain  the yellow fish is a reminder to people that fish and other creatures live in the rivers and that we also depend on those same rivers and streams for clean drinking water   what goes down the drain goes into the river  since the program began in nineteen ninety-one trout unlimited estimates that across canada more than sixty thousand storm drains have been painted and seven hundred thousand homes have been reached with the educational yellow fish road door hangers  the educational message is simple  whether you're washing the car or cleaning around the house use non-toxic products whenever possible  for information on the yellow fish road program contact trout unlimited in calgary at one eight hundred nine zero one two zero four zero   that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   the sight of a clear-cut is enough to bring tears to the eyes of many environmentalists  clear-cut has become synonymous with  moonscape   when people think of a clear-cut forest they think of vast seas of stumps open areas devoid of wildlife and subject to erosion  doctor dan lowe is not a fan of clear-cut logging although he believes the controversial method is somewhat misunderstood by the public and what the public must do is step beyond clear-cuts and look at the bigger picture of forest management  dan lowe is now in his late seventies a forest ecologist who wrote the textbook on canada's forest ecosystems  and most recently he's known as the author of our place   he grew up in alberta and now lives in new denver british columbia where he's fighting plans to clear-cut the slocan valley near his home  i asked him about clear-cutting forests  speech, 2 min 30 sec question and answer between a and z, 6 min   doctor dan lowe is a respected forest ecologist  he lives in new denver in the slocan valley in british columbia  next week we'll find out about alternatives to clear-cutting from doctor dan egan   he's a biologist from the university of alberta who now heads up a research program on forest ecosystem management for alberta pacific forest industries  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  coming up next tammy schroeder with this week's ecofacts and trends   the prince edward island nature trust is using caution signs to help save endangered piper plovers  in a province with very little natural habitat left to protect signs and armies of volunteers are a good way to help these beach-loving birds  mary goodale of the island nature trust says piping plover numbers are down again this year  she estimate the p e i population at only sixty birds  that's down from sixty-five last year and forty percent down from just five years ago   piping plovers depend on cobbly beaches for their nesting habitat and this unfortunately puts them at odds with beach-loving humans   inside p e i national park piping plovers receive protection and they seem to be doing very well  goodale's group tries to help the piping plovers outside the national park   with some money from the federal government and world wildlife fund and many volunteers the nature trust patrols beaches and erects temporary signs around nests  they cannot legally prevent people from walking through nest areas  they instead try to educate and ask for voluntary assistance in protecting the plovers  unfortunately the numbers of piping plovers in atlantic canada are still declining   goodale says endangered species legislation more volunteers and steady funding are needed to save the endangered piping plover  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   least-cost logging that's how ecologist doctor dan lowe  defines clear-cutting  as we heard last week on the chevron ecofile he believes forest companies must begin practising more sustainable methods of logging  that's exactly what alberta pacific forest industries is trying to accomplish in north-eastern alberta  the company harvest aspen from the boreal forest to make pulp  but instead of clear-cutting the company's launched a massive long-term experiement in ecosystem management of the forest  this includes leaving clumps of trees and woody debris on the cutblocks to help maintain the biodiversity of the area  doctor dan egan is a biologist and an adjunct professor at the university of alberta who now heads up the environmental research team for alberta pacific  he explains this new approach is one that attempts to emulate natural disturbance regimes  speech, 1 min 45 sec   you can easily see the difference between al-pac's cutblocks and those of other companies  as doctor dan egan points out research has lead to the development of different methods of logging  speech, 1 min   generally government rules dictate that all merchantable trees that is those that are of a size and quality that can be sold must be removed from a cutblock  hence the clear-cuts  so al-pac is going against the grain by leaving merchantable timber on its cutblocks in the interest of maintaining biodiversity  according to doctor dan egan on average that amounts to about eight percent of the merchantable volume on a cutblock  speech, 1 min 25 sec   doctor dan egan believes it will take t  fifteen to twenty years before science can give a definitive answer on this new method of logging  however he recognizes it's unrealistic to expect forest companies to stop logging while the scientists do their research  so the main concern becomes one of adapting forest management techniques as new information comes to light  speech, 50 sec   as doctor egan is quick to point out no one can be complacent  the scientists must be looking for warning signs that the experiment is going off-track  also there are issues like global climate change which can effect the forest ecosystem  speech, 1 min 5 sec   moving from the world of academics to that of industry has been a major step for doctor dan egan   speech, 25 sec   doctor dan egan is a biologist and adjunct professor at the university of alberta  he is also environmental sciences research coordinator for alberta pacific forest industries  you're listening to the chevron ecofile  up next is tammy schroeder with this week's ecofacts and trends   rising grain prices may be the first global indicator that tells us we are on a path that is not sustainable  for almost fifty years grain prices have declined as productivity has steadily increased  that all came to an end in nineteen ninety-four when wheat prices began rising soaring thirty-nine percent over three years   that's according to wilfred grey of the worldwatch institute  grey says the reason grain production is slowing down has to do with the deterioration of the earth's ecosystem   this may not immediately effect affluent people but for the one point three billion people who live on a dollar a day or less grey  says such a rise in price could be life threatening  eventually third world political instability could affect multinational corporations the stock markets and the international monetary system  in short it could disrupt economic progress worldwide   according to wilfred grey achieving a balance between food and people depends as much on family planners as on farmers  also decisions made in energy departments that could affect climate stability may have as much an effect on food security as decisions made in agriculture departments  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   when i was in university i took several courses in outdoor recreation and parks management  one of the central concepts of leisure studies at the time was that technology would eventually create so much leisure time there'd be a never-ending demand for parks and recreation managers  as of today i now count eight months as the sum total of time i spent working on my parks and recreation career  and even that is stretching it somewhat since all of that time was spent working as a photographer and not a manager for alberta provincial parks  i worked ten days on and four days off  i was on what they called flex time  that meant no one punched a clock and no one looked over your shoulder to see if you worked thirty-seven and a half hours a week  it actually worked out very well and my less than scientific observation was that most people were keen and probably worked longer hours than they were paid for  so what happened to increasing leisure time  how many people do you know have more leisure time and are not unemployed  today we'll talk to author and activist jim hanley about a culture that's not only sustainable they have more than twenty-three hours a day for sleep and leisure
