 oh yeah  i'm tryna trying to get them to buy on our street  yeah  laugh you want some neighbours huh  but uh   well i want a neighbour  and i want a neighbour that uhm  you know i want a neighbour that i like  yeah   and also one with a kid that's   gonna going to be more or less the same age as   word   yeah when is she due  she's due in october  october first   right   marcie 's due in september  so uh   right   oh so that's really close  does she do they know what they're having  a baby  yes  no laugh   as opposed to a boy or girl  ah no i think she's doing the amnio possibly as we speak  or something   she's doing one  yeah  uh hmm  they uh i dunno don't know i mean it's a strange situation cos like we were immediately warned that there was a definite reason for it  mm hmm  and and i mean if  if you're gonna going to have an amnio and you aren't prepared to let's say you know have an abortion if you see something then why do it  mm hmm  like you know  and they're not  well jan has said tha-   i mean jan doesn't make the decision necessarily but you know as a kind of a unit they've said no like whatever happens happens and we go with that  uh huh   i don't think i don't think  alexa 's quite so sure about that and then i think she's probably pushed for the amnio  sure about that   yeah  there's really no reason for an amnio  is she thirty-five  she's thirty-six yeah   she's thirty-six  and and do they do they  sort of counsel you to have one if you're over thirty-five  as a matter of course  uhh no but they counsel you to th they counsel you in in   the sense that they they say that the option's open to you and they say what are the risks  and they say  yeah  they don't uh definitely don't push you one way or the other  mm hmm  at least they don't you know  they they haven't   yeah  they don't   might be at forty  i think at forty they start to push it more  i know  my brother's had some clients who're  forty and   i think  what they   maybe   mm hmm   the thing is they do the statistics  uh hmm  and the statistics show you what the risks  are  and the risks are staggeringly higher as you  you know for every year you go up  the uh  mm hmm   uh hmm   uh huh   you know the ratios just get smaller and smaller  uh huh   but you know i think that we were prepared uh sort of in the back of our minds that we weren't gonna going to   you know go through life   with a downs syndrome child   with a downs syndrome kid or something  well i don't think that marcie would  no  and and she phoned her mom and said uh you know what do you think  and uh you know she said  forget it  she's the one who has the major responsibility for  name and for this cousin right   forget it   oh yeah oh yeah   yeah  anyway uhm so they'll do that and i hope everything's fine  but you know   cough   yeah   no it's weird though i mean you really do have to be prepared for like what are you gonna going to do  then   yeah and why you're doing it  you've gotta got to say to yourself why am i doing this  because if it if it's only to to   word   to find out the sex laugh   to find out the sex   or if it's to find out the sex then yeah it's not worth the risk  yeah  although i guess if you're if you are  prepared to keep a child that has downs syndrome and you get six months of preparing mentally it may be better  financially  you know   i suppose   i suppose i suppose   that would be good  it's better than finding out on the day of   yeah on the day of   yeah i guess you're right  but still  but still it's like an awful word    but   well it's a heavy thing no matter how you look at it eh  i mean having the power to  help to   yeah it is   and you can't you can't uh  there's no way of answering  you can't uhm   you can't even say what you would do  uh huh  no   cos cos you know   we we were saying what if  what happens whether this or that we were just saying   again they would say er we don't know what we'll would do until we uh until we know  mm hmm   mm hmm mm hmm  well then  yeah   yeah   you got through that part  oh yeah  well i mean we didn't really expect any  i know any uh strange stuff  no no   but it did i tell you one good thing about the   uhm the place the  you know they call marcie did she tell you  they called her and then they left a message  yeah  and the message said call please call   uh annabelle sampson you know from the montreal childrens'  regarding your ah amnio  mm hmm   mm hmm  and so marcie really thought god it's only been two weeks you know there're some there's something wrong  so she phoned and them and the woman was in a meeting  and uh she said oh okay  yeah i think she said no i mean i really have to speak to her you know can you get her out of the meeting and they did   so i thought that was really  word   mm hmm  and then the woman came and saved the time just to say that everything was fine and uh   mm hmm   i thought it was good that they don't hang you on the  the line there for too long  mm hmm   mm hmm for sure  so it's a boy  well that'll be fun   it's a boy   another boy  did you tell marcelus   is he  yeah yeah first day and once we told him   and he had a cry a big cry said he wanted a girl  ohhh  but uh he would've said that he would've said he wanted a   boy   the opposite yeah yeah   cos he's been saying to name  it's a boy it's a boy  yeah  and now we got the name of word  we had to think of names and marcelus is uh you know  oh oh laugh   coming up with doozies  yeah he's written his different names every so often  mm hmm mm hmm  and it's part of a g   it's it's a game  words   we used to do that with hanny   two or three words   uhm i mean we didn't know who it was but we always used to sort of sit around and think up the silliest names we could you know  yeah ebeneezer and   ma macaroni martin was our favourite laugh   yeah   oh i don't think   you know high humour for children laugh  you don't want to uhm as though you don't   wanna want to commit yourselves  like you don't wanna want to  say to people uhm you know before your baby is born your baby for example you wanna want to   mm hmm   maybe you chose the name jared four months ahead  mm hmm   and you tell everybody  you're not gonna going to go  oh we're gonna going to call him  jared we're gonna going to call him jared  because then the baby starts to be called jared   yes  and uh then when you suddenly think hmm maybe not word   no   no  well i think you know names are funny  i think you you know when you've found a name kind of  like it's funny i mean we were hesitating between two  actually  right up until the end  or i was more than joe   but we didn't tell anybody  everyone asked us what names are you thinking of what names are you thinking of  and we just didn't tell people because they influence your decision  that's right  you know i tape cuts off   le lievre yeah   oh yeah  words my sister   edie edie   yeah  well it's w it is a   a scottish and uh kind of it's a kind of a gaelic catholic name   gaelic name mm hmm   and uh but they did some where kinda  kind of family you know nobody said it was not a nice name but they said edie   mm hmm  and so they called her edie kathryn to   to give her you know as a standby  kind of a name   that's nice   really nice yeah mm hmm   mm  well yeah she alana le lievre  ended up calling her first little boy er henri   henry   oh of course yeah that's right   because because   it was wasn't it didn't   turn out to be a girl   yes but i mean you can pay eighty dollars for a sleeper for a baby for a two-month-old   that's right you can   word oh minimum  that's when it's on sale  mm hmm  have you been over to the pumpkin and egg shop   ah yes yes  that's  i've been in there  we bought an outfit you know this sounds very pompous but we bought him outfits in paris and it cost uh sixty dollars  i mean that was when we were  it was your first baby laugh   that's what it that was  laugh   this was the exact same like at the same  same label and everything and uh  i think it was like a hundred and twenty  in in that shop  mm hmm mm hmm   yeah well my mum went to this place on street name  called jeune d'ici you know that very fancy ladies' shop cos she wanted to buy jared a snowsuit when he was a newborn  oh yeah   oh she did get quite a nice one didn't she   she did  but she was looking around for a long time before she found you know she wanted to find like the perfect snowsuit for her  first grandchild and all of that  but uhm she went into that store and saw one that was for a three-month-old you know a three-month size fits then when they're basically two weeks older that's it right   never again  yeah right yeah   and they look exactly   it was two hundred and sixty dollars   whoah  she couldn't i mean she just was so revolted  she said it wasn't even nice laugh   it wasn't even that great you know   well yeah you know i've been forced to eat my words you know so many times but i remember looking and when  marcelus was born and we saw the little leather biker jacket in the uh window in the as we sit at lunch   you know like two words   mm hmm mm hmm   and uh it was three hundred and fifty dollars or something and i i said to marcie you know  what what kind of unthinkable idiot you know would buy something like this for a one-year-old child and you know  and it's too much money and this and that  mm mm   and then of course we were given one so   laugh you were given the biker jacket  he had to wear it  well at least you didn't take it in and get something else but   no no word   laugh   but nobody else knows that  yeah  well that's i know it's funny  i mean you compromise your principles so many laugh times  laugh   well we got him a new snowsuit this year as you know and and uh it was worth the money  like you you pay  maybe we paid thirty dollars more than the one from  sears or the bay  yeah   mm   and yet and yet it's way better  yeah well as they get older they are a lot tougher on their clothes  you want at least something that's   especially especially   a snow suit  or something that uh  yeah     you wear every day  you wear every day and it they're  on their knees all the time and uh   two or three words   it has to be worn   mm   whispers i know  and do you remember that from   yeah  do you remember that from when you were a kid  you know like getting into your snowsuit after school  and just so you yank the thing and rip the zippers open and slide into it and  and and stepping under   you walk on the the heels uh  you make heels out of the back of the legs too
