 now that's a good shot for our viewers don  they she just touched that rock and because it is very very keen it slid out of the ring so you can see how very very fast the ice is  you can hit almost three quarters of a rock and your shooter's  uh very difficult to stay so it's very keen   melissa soligo the british columbia second now attempting to place one in the rings  you'll notice the rushes that the b c rink is using  we'll talk a little more about those later in the telecast   they're trying to take advantage of that stone just outside the rings over on the left-hand side of your screen   they'd ideally like to get it just in behind that rock but it  appears as though it's going to pull up just a little short   colleen you were telling us that your experience on this ice particularly on this centre sheet there's more movement to the outside of the rings then there is down the centre line  interestingly enough with this sheet they had to reflood it twice uh because of a few problems and this sheet does move a lot more than the other the other uh sheets but you have to pick your spot  it is swingy here on the in-turn side that sherri is throwing for this in-turn draw  it will move  but if you try to come the other way on the out-turn to bury around a centre-guard it doesn't move as well  is there any reason don why they wouldn't have attempted to go  to the other side of the house and in behind those two corner guards  belonging to b c  well   heidi hanlon does not have word or two so if she goes in behind then that's an opportunity for julie sutton to  to follow her down and may score s two points in that area  she wants to play away from those two corner guards  those two guards on the left actually are in favour of julie sutton  so without last rock she wants to keep play to the open side of the ice   oh yes and in the centre  that rock really moved over a little bit too far and it's very high  it's not in the rings   so they may be able to hit and roll behind cover with this one  she's gonna going to hit it on the other side  she's going to roll the opposite direction   the stone just delivered by melissa soligo rolls out of play   you always like in this first end to have this opportunity to  throw a throw a draw without having the pressure of knowing that uh you could be a little deeper a little  uhm little light still  so you're still kind of working on your draw weight even though the curlers get practice time before the uh before the   game a lot of timing lapses between practice time and actual game time  the delivery by sheri stewart on an attempted draw over on the right-hand side came up short and this one by kathy floyd also  pulls up short  well now julie sutton's gonna going to   take advantage of this one don  you see the rock is away off to the side  now julia speaker doesn't say 'julie' sutton will gamble in that area and if it doesn't work out for her and there's a whole bunch of rocks in there uh by the opposition she simply has the full range to draw to   but if those rocks were more into the centre how do you get into the four-foot   so when you have last rock you play it at the sides and when you do not have last rock you play into the centre  julie and jodie sutton are twins obviously not identical  julie is sixteen minutes older  i suggested that is perhaps the reason she is the skip  laugh   jodie skipped the team that they won their first canadian junior title with and uh at that year they didn't go on to a world championship cos there was no world junior championship for women at that time  that's a beautiful shot  isn't that a gorgeous curling shot at the very first end   that's very pretty   and that was the danger the new brunswick team dra  dropping that rock short of the rings  you heard the instruction from heidi hanlon to her third kathy floyd  just enough weight to push that red b c stone out of the rings   well there's another good shot   so with the hit and roll new brunswick now lies one   well that's an excellent shot  good control of her takeout weight by kathy floyd  any more weight don she might've stayed very straight and  or the rock may have fallen back against the turn a bit  so that was good control of your weight  that is very important on this ice  it's weight sensitive ice   this sutton rink they're one of the strongest hitting teams i've ever seen from a women's team before and they don't believe they can miss a hit which is a marvelous thing a marvelous confidence to have  well elaine jackson the fifth player and the coach was telling me that during a week of round-robin competition skip julie sutton missed just one hit  that's unbelievable   that is an unbelievable situation  that you go through a competition and miss one takeout uhm  and just talking to julie uh moments before the game and i asked her what kind of shot do you want to win it and she said the same shot you had in eighty-two laugh   a wide open hit  do you think she would react the same way  she said she'll go crazier   laugh   i think that may have inspired the sport of bungee jumping that performance of yours in regina ten years ago now   laugh   however there was no elastic band to haul you back in regina laugh   that's the thing yes   i needed one   she wants to hang around with her shooter  she doesn't wanna want to roll out of the rings  well she changes the shot for julie sutton with the hit and roll into the back of the eight foot  now you know why she wants to stay with that takeout don  is the fact that if she rolls out then it'll allow uh british columbia to draw around any one of those corner guards  now heidi hanlon is forcing the play on that shot stone   now what would she mean unless it really goes big that way i'd rather take it to the centre   unless it curls a lot and then she'll roll behind the corner guard if not she wants to roll to the centre  the rock really finishes big at the end  gonna going to have to go hard on it to get a piece of it  so with julie sutton hitting and rolling out several options now for heidi hanlon   now you heard julie say i turned it over a bit  what she means is that she rolled her wrist and the rock made a motion inside the broom  she really didn't l let the rock glow  go clean   it's a common habit of a lot of curlers throwing the in-turn  they roll their wrist over and the first reaction of the rock is to the inside of the intended target   they're not going to get it past that guard  she was trying to sneak behind that new brunswick guard and get it in there but they are going to get a bit of a break cause they're going to rub off that guard and catch a bite of the twelve foot to lie one   i said a common habit with a lot of curlers and you heard heidi say i must've turned it in   from down here on ice level she didn't look like she threw it badly at all  she looked like she was up the broom but uh i th don't think they anticipated that big a swing right there   because it is swinging a little bit more on that in-turn side than it had been during the week   now if julie sutton hits this rock right on the nose it'll be a blank end and that's exactly what she would like   either that or a shooter roll away not stay in the rings  she may end up in the rings  yes she is going to catch a piece of the twelve foot  she really did not want that with last stone  she wanted to count more than one  now they are not removing the other stone at the top of the twelfth  they may call for a measurement here  from our overhead camera perspective it would appear that that stone is out of play but they are going to ask for a measurement to determine whether or not that rock is biting  i don't think it is but you have the opportunity to measure why not  we did test the rings uh during the week to make sure they're accurate and the rings here are fairly accurate  when it looks out it usually is  and indeed it is out of play so it's a score of one for british columbia on the opening end  julie sutton with last rock was hoping to blank but her final stone caught a piece of the twelve foot and she picks up a single point and after one end of play in the championship game it's b c one new brunswick nothing tv advertisements   nineteen eighty-nine b c championship nineteen ninety-one b c championship   will there be a canadian championship to add to her list of credits   she leads one nothing playing this second end against heidi hanlon of new brunswick but has relinquished last rock advantage to new brunswick  you know it's been four years since a british columbia rink won the canadian women's championship  it's been twenty-eight years since a rink from new brunswick  captured the canadian title  that was mabel deware back in nineteen sixty-three  i think heidi's following the uh cue set by jim sullivan who of course was in the brier final but lost to ed werenich last year  that perhaps gave her a little extra bit of confidence knowing that uh new brunswickers can curl and can curl well  colleen would that suggest with the success that jim sullivan had last year at the brier in sault saint marie and what heidi hanlon has accomplished here in saskatoon at the scott tournament of hearts that curling in new brunswick is on the rise  curling in new brunswick is very very strong  one of the problems that eastern teams face though is that  it's a numbers game  there are so few curlers to draw from still just because our populations are smaller   but certainly curling there is extremely strong  well they must have a good program because uhm both heidi hanlon and jim sullivan team if you watch them throw the rocks  they're they're almost flawless in their curling deliveries which means they spend a lot of time at it and any time that you got a good curling delivery you're going to be very successful   and they're playing it very wide open here and uh the thing that you notice when they play it wide open is that they hit the rock almost on the nose every time don  i think that there's been nine rocks played ten rocks played in this end and they've hit the rock on the nose nine times  one excepting was the roll over to the position where it is now so that tells you that they are very very accurate   and wouldn't you know it as soon as i said that they hit and roll out  but the important part is she did make contact with the opposition stone and removed it from the rings   and with the time clock being used here at the scott tournament of hearts very little wasted time between shots  the time clocks have certainly been a marvelous addition to  curling not just for television viewers at home but for the curlers themselves who don't like slow games  and none of the curlers all week have been in any danger of uh being close to having to forfeit a game because they've run out of time  each side gets seventy-five minutes and it works much like uh  a chess clock in speed chess where it stops and starts whoever has control of the rings
