 and this pulse check has to be a minimum of five seconds  but in the end you have to be comfortable with what you find  if it takes you fifteen seconds   if she has a pulse that means that you've completed the assessment you've checked for responsiveness called for help opened the airway checked for breathing checked for pulse and the conclusion is that the victim is unconscious and in respiratory arrest  the rescuer will keep the airway open and do mouth to mouth  asks a question tape stops and starts again   as often as you can   not less than every minute  asks a question   yes you can  makes a comment   so i would for instance your position is  is great now and if i were where you are i would   just be holding the head here i would pinch the nose leave  a breath i'd stay here because it loses time to go like this  so i would just stay comfortably here and i would check the pulse count to five leave a breath you know   okay  responds   other things you can look for while you're down this close doing mouth to mouth is a change in colour any kind of movement or noise   anything that looks different stop what you're doing and reassess  so that you will always know exactly what to do no matter who collapses   whether it's your boss or a student or someone having a heart attack because of their bill  i don't know do you see people with accounts to pay laughs with audience   no matter what their age or what the reason if you always know  check for responsiveness  it's a great thing when they're not unconscious cos then you can speak to them  what's your problem laughs with audience   get up get outta out of here  no really when people collapse and they're conscious you should encourage them to stay put  makes a comment   that's right  kay okay   it's great when they're conscious pronounced con-shee-us  and you can do a great rescue job with a conscious person as well as an unconscious person  but with an unconscious person the only thing you find out is by carefully following the a b cs   so how does everybody feel about the a b cs  any better noises from audience   now you'll have to practice on each other again with additions such as what if you think the person has a broken back or what if the person vomits while you're rescuing them  we will do these variations but i just wanted to disturb you initially  right now you can take a break   and then i'll get the mannequin and you can practice on  two words tape stops and starts again   writing on chalkboard starts and remember writing on chalkboard ends   i will always remember the first time i did a c p r course in this room in i think nineteen seventy-nine  with a couple of people with a whore  concordia used to give lots of c p r courses to everybody   and word had a whore in here  there were three instructors roger flatley jamie mccall and me   roger 's in ontariario ontario  now  comments   so roger and jamie decided that they were  gonna going to torture me  and they did  i just walked in here and they said candice is  gonna going to start the course and teach anatomy and physiology and   i died a thousand deaths laughs with audience   and i decided to uh writing on chalkboard starts write on the board small l o g y  i don't spell any better but at the time i wrote like this  brushing noise on the chalkboard writing on chalkboard ends  my hand was shaking so much i drew a curly heart laughs  about this big   but there were like twenty people here taking up that part of the room and the blackboard was over there  and i drew this heart laughs with audience   and i probably drew a bunch of coronary circulations  for all i knew i know i labelled a pacemaker  writing on chalkboard starts i probably did a cross section too and labelled the bundle like this laugh writing on chalkboard ends   and people just sat there going sigh i wanna   want to go home laughs with audience   so now if i ever  and since i recognize completely my lack of artistic ability i rarely draw a heart  but when i do i draw it about this big writing on chalkboard   but i'm not even gonna going to draw one today laughs with audience   i'm just going to say loud noise, something falling on the floor that the heart is about this big  your heart is about the size of your fist and your heart is about the size of your fist   and we can generalize and say that everyone's heart is about  the size of a fist  their own fist  nestled right here in the thoracic cavity the chest cavity  and what you have in your chest cavity which is limited up here by your collar bone kay okay and down here by your diaphragm   you've heard you've heard of this famous diaphragm that helps you breathe and gives you hiccups   well all in here from here to here and from here to here you have lungs  that's it  lungs blood vessels a little few spaces and a heart  nestled between the lungs  and there's a lot of connections between the lungs and the heart   with the the fact that the heart pumps blood through the circulatory system which goes into the lungs to be oxygenated  so there's a big connection here  your lungs are like big sponges from here to here  one thing  i thought of this years ago and i i can hardly ever refrain from saying it  that's why when prople are stabbed or shot their lungs are affected  kay okay even if you miss the heart it can cause serious damage  the lungs they hit the lungs  and the lungs are highly vascular with a lot of very small blood vessels which go through the lungs and pick up oxygen and leave carbon dioxide behind  and carbon monoxide for that matter   or anything else   any other gaseous thing which is mostly carbon dioxide some carbon monoxide and oxygen  and if this connection keeps functioning well then we all just go about our business with our heart beating and breathing away   for the most part people can't control their heartbeat  and cos you do have some control over your breathing you can hold your breath  but in the end it's an involuntary thing  you will breathe  unfortunately there are problems that can arise with one's heart and one's breathing which may lead to your collapse a victim's collapse  and this is when it's good to have a rescuer arrive  it would be great in the province of quebec if the average amount of rescuers in the population were closer to say ten percent than one percent  but in the mean time it might be interesting for you to know that to to to realize that if the room is full of smoke for instance that can compromise your breathing  so if you get out of the room full of smoke if you take the victim out of the room full of smoke that can be a great help  time is often a crucial factor so the longer you stay in a room full of smoke the more likely you are to collapse from it   i think everybody has heard that in a fire in a house on fire in a room on fire what what is the worst thing is the smoke that makes them collapse not the fire that burns them  people don't necessarily get burned in fires and if they do it's long after they've collapsed because of the carbon monoxide from the fire   and other toxic things in the air   so i think everybody can  maybe i'll ask each person if you can  can you tell me one thing off the top of your head that can go wrong with your breathing or your heart  they're interconnected so if something affects your breathing it will affect your heart and vice versa   my example is a house on fire  you have to think of something else  responds   okay  responds   pardon me  repeats   an epileptic seizure can sometimes cause a person to stop breathing depending on the severity or the duration and also any damage they might incur to themselves having the seizure  so that's a possibilty  can you think of one  did you say  responds   an asthma attack  if people have asthma it can compromise their breathing so much that they can't breathe  if someone stops breathing whether it's because of the secondary effects of an epileptic seizure which in itself doesn't necessarily uh cause someone to stop breathing  anything that causes you to stop breathing in the end  if it if the result is too prolonged then you can't breathe  you have to breathe periodically in order to be able to breathe  so once you stop breathing for a few minutes you can't breathe again and so then you're in respiratory arrest  so sure asthma can be life threatening that way  comments   an a an allergic reaction  what what happens is that mucous membranes   and and are most susceptible to a strong allergic reaction   and maybe you've heard the term anaphylactic shock  responds   that type of reaction means that you have such a strong reaction and it involves your airway so that you can't breathe   and people who have serious allergic reactions they often end up having a respiratory arrest from it  asks a question   choking on something is a very common problem and is very easily remied remedied if someone sees you choking and gets up and does the heimlich manoeuver right  if you're choking it means that your airway which consists of your mouth your nose your throat and then these tubes that someone may or may not have described to you at some point that go down into your lungs   your windpipe is here goes down into your lungs branches into  bronchi which branch into bronchioles which branch into alveoli right  the whole idea is that this whole lung area will have as much surface area inside as possible to take the oxygen outta  out of the air that you need  and so if whether it's because something is stopping you from breathing into your mouth or your nose   or rather that or if there is a blockage in your throat   or even if you have something in your lungs that's keeping the oxygen from going from the air into your blood  anything that keeps the oxygen out of your blood will make it impossible for you to breathe  so choking is a common cause  and other things of course are being struck by lightning  trauma uh drug reactions heart attacks strokes  so there are lots of things that can end up affecting either your respiratory or your circulatory system end of tape   clears throat right  so i'm gonna going to start first with something that's not tough which is how to test your camera  right   so the first thing you gotta got to do  is just pretest this the century chart which is for the focus of the lens and see how sharp the lens is and how much leeway you have in its focus   in the uhm being over and under soft focus  and this which is a really bad chart for an example at the university but it's a chart for in french word   in english registration costs  and then on the back is kind of an example of a  frame test which is done to check the ground glass piece in the viewfinder to see if your frame that you're seeing through the viewfinder is the same as the image you're getting on the film  and if it's not you'll either then change the camera  or if you don't have time to do that be able to compensate based on knowing what lens you use at how many feet away   the difference right to left or up and down word  so we'll start with the century chart  the century chart has to be set up straight  you can't do it at could be 'on' an angle like this laughing from audience, people arriving late   no it's could be " that's" alright  i'm just starting up  kay okay   the century chart has to be straight so that your plank  to the lens is correct   the idea is to set the camera up at a certain range in which  you can get a clear image of any one of these sections  but you have to have the flat lines in your definition of the frame as well as some of the larger images  then if you're doing a camera test for a production company which generally you do not in the university somewhere in one of the corners of the frame you have to write down the production company that you're working for the camera you're using the lens you're using as well as how many feet away you are at  so that you know all the possible mathematical angles you need to then collect  after that you take a measurement and we'll use eight feet  as the distance from the gate to the shutter   and at eight feet you take a measurement say that's what the distance is  you put your camera at eight feet and you take focus   it should be in focus  if it's not in focus that means it's not calibrated properly  but you film it anyhow  before you film you write on a piece of tape aside starts  obviously not to ruin the chart aside ends eight feet   that way when you watch the film you'll know what the focus is  and if it's soft if it's off if it's completely correct it'll be on the film  the next thing you do is you take that off
