 you know it's like those things would have never even been thought of being asked thirty forty years ago  you know like  well no because your band council was  all two words   it didn't have   yes  and they didn't have that many decisions to make  not as many as they did once once the area started opening up and they had other problems other si   situations o other  alternatives to look at  another way of life  so it was hard for them to it was hard for them to  go ahead and and say to the band council that you know uhm i don't believe in what you're doing  and you don't they don't understand  how to start it   mhh hmm   like you say the old traditional way was not to question   really  mhh hmm   you know it's noise in the background, laughing   what are you guys doing over

speakers  no chance at all laugh   no chance laugh at all   i'm glad a few words laugh    ya   you know what was the best though was when your brothers would sit there   oh god   we walked into the living room and  rhonda had come in with that short little whatever it was that she wore  i think it was a slip or whatever it was that she was wearing at the time laugh   laugh   and your brothers'd brothers would  be watching and she'd come in and they'd flip around laugh  and sit there and watch rhonda   laugh   laugh   forget about the t v   and uh   that was fun   i wonder who she did marry in the long run   ya she would have got married to somebody who wanted  word an awful lot  oh i think so  i think she probably turned out alright  she's probably got a big family  word happy with her husband  she should have found herself a farmer   she liked farming  i'm sorry  did she like   she likes lots of kids  lots of kids laugh   laugh   well our poor friend hannah got caught by a farmer and  she's got lots of kids  uh i never pictured her as a farmer's wife   i always pictured her word  and word doing something  like   well   ya   when i was out to see her the last time she'd just helped one of the cows calf  wow laugh   cos brad 's   well brad was laid up  he had fallen off the tractor and he had sprained his uhm shoulder  mhh hmm   and uh apparently you had to put on this great big  long glove that covers your whole arm and turn the calf or whatever help the calf when it's being born  word   wow  and you know how small she was  i mean what was she  ya   she was word   ninety pounds soaking wet right  laugh   ya  but otherwise she's about a hundred and twenty maybe now  ya   mhh hmm   but still a very small  she says and brad was standing behind her saying well  you

either you  know   no   no it's not his   no no  so  you know we're we're gonna  going to be  first of all we're more interested in staying with the family   and then going to see someone else's family and laugh   yes   i'm just sorry benny didn't get down that weekend  ya  that would've been nice  ya   so anyhow since her parents aren't really going to  support this on her side you said that we're going to have a traditional wedding but not a cree traditional wedding  of what kind  i don't know  i'm going to check with the uh natives down there and see what type they have  the wampanoag native american tribe of massachusetts   oh so you you may get married down in  down down in the states but  down in the states okay   but this time i'd like you guys to come  okay  you haven't been at one of my weddings  yes we did  no you've just been at   tom   you've just been at the retaking of the vows  sneeze   right but laugh   there's just two words of things to do when you get married  no not really   laugh   no  it would be different  it would depend on uh dad depend what he was doing at the time  well what'd i'd like to do is get something close to montreal since dad will probably be in montreal  ya   mhh hmm  uh can't do the cree one because the cree one says i have to go and live with the family for a year and it   and they don't want you laugh   laugh   i have to  well i have to give them everything i earn and then at the end of the year he gets to say whether or not i get to stay married to his daughter   laugh   well you're suppoed to work for him   ya  so i i i don't think that the   tra tra traditional cree one will work  no   no no  so i'm looking for alternatives that are   that will look good  you know that will feel good feel right  ya   ya   right ya  and for our wedding rings uh i'm gonna  going to go down and i think what i'm gonna going to do is get a combination of silver and gold  did you get her an engagement ring yet  no  no  i'm broke laugh
