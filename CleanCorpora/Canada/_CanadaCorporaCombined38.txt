 ya   so what's keeping you so busy these days then if you've gotten the master's done and all that  well that's a good question  one of the things i'm doing is preparing to go up north again  ya   that that's taking up a lot of time  ya  uhm there are five of us on this team  uh huh  this project has never been  it's a new project  ya  it's never been done  ya  that's the creative writing one right   ya   these teachers up in james bay they all of them have had four courses in cree literacy   and now they're ready to go to the next stage which is to which is to develop their own creative writing skills  mhh hmm  so they're now literate in cree  well on they can write cree but  they're not they're not very good at writing stories in cree  mhh hmm   and the the objective or one of the objectives of this program is to develop a written discourse uh in cree among cree teachers  mhh hmm   so that they can pass on in the recursive way these skills to their children their students  mhh hmm   and uhm it's difficult for them because cree is their cree wri write written cree is their second written language  they write in english and speak in cree   so it's unusual for them to write in cree  it's not comfortable for them   ya ya you were saying ya   it's a different > alphabet for word  ya  uhm and they   from what they from what they've been learning today about i mean what a   well i guess there aren't that many people have been learning  but i'm thinking about this problem for example that the chinese have   transferring skills to roman alphabet the iranians the  word i mean it's crazy that they didn't use roman alphabet to write their language  mhh   ya   mhh hmm mhh hmm ya   it's it's absolutely counter-productive  it's weird isn't it  it is  it's absolutely stupid   ya mhh mhh hmm ya  i mean the chinese are going to pinyin   ya ya  it's really interesting  i mean it looks beautiful  it looks much more you know aesthetically impressive but you know ah ah i don't know  i've seen words   mhh   how do you program a computer to use that stuff  well uhh stuff like that  ya ya it's strange  and just the transferability of skill you know  it must very cultural   it must be very political  i really wonder sometimes what the motive was or what the   under understanding   and sometimes it's just a lack of understanding  about what the implications of making a choice like that are  mhh hmm   ya ya  right i don't i don't know   cos it does it look a little bit like inuktitut inuit language   uhm yes  ya  same it's syllabics   ya   and and it's quite beautiful to to see   ya exactly   it's very beautiful ya  ya   but they don't know how to write in in in   cree  and the they're losing a lot of their written well they're lo losing   i gu guess sh   should well they're not losing the written  they're losing stories  ya ya and they're not   and in and it's  a problem to write down stories because in these in aboriginal cultures to write down a story is is  almost a travesty  ya  because as soon as you writ write  it down you it becomes static  ya  and there's no fluidity to it  there's no do because every generation of elders   no interaction with the audience and  ya  ya   there's the every generation of  of elders has has a   every elder has a   maybe they bring in people that are   contemporary ya   they bring in people and and  it can change according to the weather or animal migrations or a whole bunch of things  ya   but the uhh not totally change but slightly change   the legends and the myths you know   ya ya   so what we're trying to do is trying to stay away from  myth and legend because in fact they don't allow any critiquing  of of legend  oh okay   mhh hmm   legend is not to be criticized  mhh hmm  legend is to be listened to  mhh hmm  and uhm so we're gonna  going to try and teach strategies for writing stories  mhh hmm   and and they will then use these strategies for their children to write down  down stories  and we don't know what the heck we're doing  right   we're rookies at this  and as i think i mentioned to you on the phone   word   well i think anybody doing this would be rookies   well i mean we are teachers you know  we're we don't   and this hasn't been done before so we're gonna  going to have simul simultaneous    but that's what i'm saying   ya   so anybody doing it would be  rookies   ya   ya   that's right  and we're gonna going to have simultaneous translation  it's gonna going to be  wild   but i don't know how that's gonna   going to work  and it's about ten days total you said  mhh  incredible   ya   all day sessions  mhh we arrive and we go wednesday night thursday night  friday afternoon friday night all day saturday all day sunday saturday morning saturday
