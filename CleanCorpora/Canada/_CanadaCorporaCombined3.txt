 good  and then they're they're  gonna going to make sort of a little nook here right  ya that's a little nook there  we can put those shelves  ya   ya   well this is twelve inches deep  ya  so we can either words a phrase that is cut off by speaker b   you know what there is gonna going to  be a lot more room down there when this happens  there really is   yup ya ya   cos having those those walls up there you know is really gonna going to   create a lot of floor space  mhhm yup  yes it will  but we can you know you can use ah ah some of the leftover plywood if you want to make the shelves for the nook  you know the the bits that are lopped off  to make the sh shelves   what do you mean to make the shelves   well if it's half inch plywood that they're using for the wall  that we have to cut like here okay we need two pieces but we're only using a few inches of the second one  so unless we can use it we can use it somewhere else words of the shelves   ya   mhhm   oh you mean you think words the shelves   ya get them get something hmm ya   well i found uhm a couple of brackets you know holders   that let to fit words to fit into it  ya   we found three of those uh individual but not as nice as that  okay  i guess i'll have to words   you don't necessarily want this kind  no no that would be very strong  no   no  no that's just for decorating to hold up little shelves that hold up word like that like that  well for this you figure is really gonna   going to be the tricky bit huh  yup yup  cos that's where the complicated cutting comes in and that's where you have all those wires and pipes and uh  ya but remember they're gonna going to   do it on the inside  ya  so it's really gonna going to   be about avoiding all those wires and pipes  mhhm   that's true  ya  so the the tricky part is just  gonna going to be cutting for the stairs  mhhm  that's really well  well  and then do you want to paint it on your side anyway  ya  so  talked about it word   i'm gonna going to put i have uh you remember that words thing   yes  ya  yup you're gonna going to mount that down there  where  in that part of the basement  it occurred to me that you know that if   if it all it needs is to just have something to hold it up really  oh ya  there's nothing to putting it up  no the box is down there already  right  you showed me the box  there's an electrical box in the ceiling and  ya   oh ya that's right  well no this one i think this is uhm the set  to be plugged in remember  ya   oh so you just plug word   word   no this doesn't even get fitted into a box  okay  in fact th and there are two of them down there   there's that one which is and then there is another one which is about half the length   so i thought that what i'd do word that the dryer the washing machine instead of over here  mhhm   and i thought that what i would do is put the laundry room  in here sort of going that way and the shower room  in here going that way  ya   okay  and then over here there is that box and so i could just get him to fit in something ya  right so you just get word something    and then maybe get something for above the washer-dryer  and then   you know there is something actually right above the washer-dryer  okay  there is there's a it's not working but there's uhm   oh that's right the one with the broken word    ya ya   so that's that's like about here or  something so if i move this one here there should be plenty of light right  yup   oh ya  ya you won't even need a new one in here i think  if you've got these two  mhhm   well ya cos there's this you know the that  little room in there that doesn't have any kind of lighting in there at all  you might put one in the in the  room  ya i've got that lamp that i use now over the uh  mhhm  so all i really need is is places to plug in is all i really need  ya   mhhm  that's a good point i'll need a pl   place i need a box back here to plug in   yes  well where are the outlets now in the basement  for plugging in  ya  there's one right about here  oh so it's not where are the oulets it's where's the outlet  that's it  laugh okay  that's it extended word " thhhaaaaat's it" but  this thing over here well you can screw it can't you screw in something that   ya we have things that you can screw  in  fixtures that   ya   ya   ya  for plugging in  how many  you can get them with either one or two uhm  word   really   and you can get them so that you put this  you screw this outlet in and then screw the lightbulb in to the thing that has the outlets in it  mhhm   ya so you have two outlets and a and   lightbulb   and a lightbulb  is that dangerous  no i don't think so  well then that's simple that's what i'll do  and uhm the one thing that plugs in here and the other thing that plugs in over here is going to plug in over here  mhhm  this one uhm never got its switch put on it  i see   and i'm not going to have to have a switch put on it  these two put the plug in out  we'll put the plug in whenever we want it word   ahh okay oh  they're very awkward  ya  word ya  but that's the way we did it  mhhm   okay   that sounds pretty good  ya it's going to be nice down there  yup  ya  there's going to be uh one one thing that isn't going to be fun is uh the evening is uhm  cabinet   ya  well we're going to empty it before we move it  ya we'll look through the books and see if there's  you know i i just i'm a collector   i hate to throw away books  ya no i know words books   and especially now that i've got andy  i feel that you know i i   feel terrible throwing away anything  ya  have you ever been like that word   oh ya laugh   laugh   word hard like word  ya  anyway very good thing word   the size of this basement i suggest that you go down there right this very minute  word   laugh i remember the work on word  i i could do that you know   even if we had the lumber and everything down there and the nail-gun  ya it still would be too noisy  ya  people would get upset  and  ya ya they'd complain maisy would bark  you know   i would shoot about two nails into the floor and i'd be ready for bed  word laugh    laugh   ahh gee i wonder word maybe andy  can be there for some of that  he'll love that  he'll help it  uhha  i do know how much help he'll be laugh   laugh good good just keep him away from the gun  if i could stand it i'd invite the father to come over  and help us  do you think he'll be any help  laugh and you could keep him away from the gun too  ya word   laugh   laugh   oops  laugh   laugh   just kidding words   good good  ahh no no no   well there we go  alright well i think those are all the supplies we need  about those chairs you don't do you remember what they look like word   no  no  which chairs are we talking about  uhhm well i guess you never really saw those chairs did you  you know i think you didn't  that's right cos you never really you know we never really got to know each other until after i left him right  ya   you know extended phrase   words his furniture  that's right   yup  ya  no i was never in here other than word    audible inhale she's got some wooden chairs uh with uhh browns you know sort of colours and sort of well and they're kind of  oh ya they sound nice  mhhm i'm wondering if we should have a garage sale  hmm  i already asked you that and you said you didn't have anything to sell  not really i'm ah   laugh word many books  no i don't uh i don't part with my books  no  want to store some of mine  laugh uh   you've got that nice big storeroom at the back  you know you've word you really don't have much newspapers in there word you got lots of room   ya right   laugh   aw that's where i house most of my books but i'm  running out of bookshelves so it will soon be time to find a   sp space a space in the apartment for new bookshelves  i think it will soon be time to find a new apartment   laugh god you know that apartment it certainly will be big enough for rhianne and me  but i'm not moving in there  well it wouldn't be convenient for you on the second floor   no not at all no  well  well  uh huh  everytime i go down there i just you know i just try to  realize what it's all going to look like  of course to make it even bigger you could knock that little room down and open up that space if you're walling off this whole area  ya but then i uh taking down walls means that you gotta got to move shelf space doesn't it  but you don't have any shelves on those walls do you  i do   oh you do  on the inside ya  okay  i've got uhh those plastic milk crates you   know all lined up you know here and i've got stuff in them  oh ya   well those could still be lined up against the back wall   i can see this is not a popular idea   well no the thing is that if i  if i lined them up against the back wall then it would be harder for me to get to the stuff that is on those cement  levels  ya ya  right  mhhm   ya that's true  well okay  words   nevermind   i don't know  no it's uh it was just thought  ya see what i'm thinking of doing is taking you know all these books that i have over here that are sitting uh you know on the other side the washing machine  there   ya   mhhm   it you know it seems to me that this would be a big enough space to hold it cos it it's   wide here  oh ya it is  you know  yup  so it it really could take all of the books and i think that would be a better place for them cos they're close to the washing machine  and i don't know if it you know when it's hot water  there's steam and   there you know it comes out so it seems to me that  ya   ya   so i guess that all of that you're probably right i'd have more room to uh   ya but it's uh it's  not uh not crucial  you know i might think about it actually  ya  words easy for us to take it down would it  it wouldn't take very long would it   no it wouldn't take uh very long at all  words light words   make it it would make it feel big eh  it would  ya  well then what you could do is is maybe redistribute these lights  put this one more in the centre of this area  ya   ya  and ah it would be bigger and brighter  ya   ya  why couldn't there be a window down here  ya  there is you know but it's been boarded off  it's just above well you know where it is just where  the uh   it's in the little well just outside here
