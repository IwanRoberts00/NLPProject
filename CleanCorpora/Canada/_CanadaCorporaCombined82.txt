didn't like that though eh  no my mom went and sat with him and read him a book   cos they don't want him to get all wired  that's a good name for it though the penalty box  ya you go sit there and be quiet laugh for two minutes  that's good  it's like the time-out chair  ya the time-out chamber   well they weren't doing anything wrong  they were just having fun  they were just like running and screaming and bouncing off word and wrestling and they just wanted   ya well but i understand  i understand but we have people that live downstairs and they didn't  i think it was very good that they

was that   oh ya but i mean  we could go on cross-country ski trails cos there's real nice trails apparently like super nice  oh really   you just bring a day pack your lunch  park the van and  then a few words   ya   i could get into that very much  but you don't wanna want to do snowshoe  ya for sure  i'd like i'd love to do the snowshoeing  but snowshoeing's for like going to a peak  well no you do snowshoeing you can do snowshoeing like uh   well if we're just going to cover terrain like go across  uh i'd rather do skis   ya you'd rather do it with cross- country skis  it's fast  okay  you know you never know  snowshoeing it's  well do you wanna want to look at buying a secondhand pair or  ya the mcgill ski sale should be coming out this month  you see i think that a pair of you know the cross-country ski boots like the old-fashioned kind  the leather  ones those would be good for uhm snowshoeing   ya   ya   because it would seem to me that the water wouldn't get in  ski boots no they're they have a  tongue in the front of them sort of and it jets out  oh that's true  it would fit in to word   the cross-country ski ones though   ya   do they  ya  mh  look what i have over here that i've been picking at  a zit  no  it's like they're  i've got bumps all along here   incomplete phrase   is it red like a zit  ya it looks like a pimple  a little itty bitty teeny tiny  oh great i

cynic   what's the word sinister looking pumpkin i've ever made  ya   ew he's scary  we should throw him off the balcony now  laugh   laugh pow   ya   it's funny your sister never heard of mat n   mat night eh the night before halloween ( devil's night): west island montreal specific   no  she went to a french school though  why  do the french don't have that  i guess they don't no  gosh that was like brutal   that was so much fun to go out on mat night  mat night   my parents wouldn't let us out on that night usually and then when i got to be like fourteen i go out  it's like a license to be mischievious  oh ya  it's ya   it's expected  my dad knew what it was  he says that's the night you take all your mats in   cos people are probably gonna going to take your mats  ya   and shoot eggs at your house  and shoot eggs laugh   ya that's what we used to do shoot eggs at people's houses   sounds like fun  wanna want to go get some eggs  do we have eggs  laugh go shoot some at the neighbour's house   we could shoot some we could shoot some two or three words  expense about three words   laugh   we should eh  ya at name 's house  at name 's house  haaa   ah ha ha ha fake laughing   oh he would not understand that i don't think  his sense of humour is uh word   he's a farmboy  he must have shot a dozen eggs  i don't know if they celebrate  ya right the closest the closest   house to him was four miles away  dozens and dozens of eggs   oh fuck ya   carry that egg two words   go to the neighbour's and shoot  eggs at laugh their house for a while   laugh   i wonder who did it laugh   eh   the only other family   it's those damn sanchez kids   the sanchez kids  rodriguez actually  oh that's his last maybe two words   maybe two words   rodriguez   is that how you pronounce it  rodriquez or rodriques   amelie pronounced it differently  it's uh spanish  it's a spanish name  see it sounds french to me   rodriguez rodriguez   rodrigues is how i pronounce it  they don't sound like it sounds better in french than it   does in english   i think it sounds like uh mexican  that's why i call him sanchez  oh ya   really  on the first time he told me his name i said well okay i'll call you sanchez  sanchez   so that became his name  it's funny cos his dad doesn't look uh  yes he does  really   very much  you find he looks spanish  yup   his mom is french canadian or no his mother's english right  ya she looks english  i don't know  ya   she looks familiar to me   like i like i feel like i know her from somewhere  you met her on an acid trip  laugh right  she's a flake  ya she's a bit flaky just like amelie  and that's why they've got s   she's like she's like   a chain-smoking sort of hippy-dippy artist kind of person  ya   which is cool cos she's she's  really nice
