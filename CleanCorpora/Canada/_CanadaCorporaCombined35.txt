 and cos i can cook   ya ya that would be great if i  had two of me  ya   ya  one to just take care of stuff and the other to go out there and bring home the bread and butter right   ya ya   no i'm finding i'm finding it's very hard  of course i'm talking about co  co-habiting we've been talking about co-habiting   for by next year  mhh hmm mhh hmm  god just the thought of going through with scraping through another winter with the bills and the this and the that  and i just like huuuuh  ya   ya   and the the just the responsibility  i mean i look at how much more paperwork i do  because you own a house  i think so  it's just it's all more  ya  it's all more  like calling norco and then you know  ya sure  i don't know it's all stupid  ya  ya i remember  i owned a house   i really i really  don't like it  no  i don't  it can turn you also i read this wonderful article about how owning a house can turn you into a very dull person   because it can take a normally intelligent person who used to read books and turn them into someone who falls in love with  going to the nursery to buy big slabby bags of sheep manure to  bring it home to put on your garden  ya   ya   ya so you think that's what happened to me already  i haven't detected yet but you you could  you you you could you could crack you know  i have two bags of sheep manure out back   laugh i've been cracking for a long time   you you could start you could start   you could start to really get into fertilizers and manure instead of ideas you know   well ya   cos it takes over your life  ya  i think that's what i'm beginning to find  i it's really a big job and i'm really tired of it  mhh  you know if i if i had uhm somebody sharing the place i mean there'd be enough money to pay somebody top sorta sort of like okay you do that  mhh hmm   pay for a service   like you dig up the this and  then i'll plant what i want  and take care of it for the summer  ya ya   cough   mhh   or you know   it wouldn't take much  and i i think it might be worth it if you can do that because it is really nice to have a backyard and you know to to be in a neighbourhood where people aren't you know all on top of  each other   uh huh   ya ya sure  but i am tired of the work  mhh hmm   i really am tired of the physical work and watering things  i'm just up to here with it  and yet you can get a sprinkler system for a vegetable garden  why not   mhh hmm  you know you can actually get to a point if you have the money where it's not taking up your entire life  mhh hmm mhh hmm  but i think it's taking up too much of mine  i'm really i'm really sure of it  is it is it things like the garden and repairs or both or  both  ya  like i burnt myself out last fall getting my garden in cooking and uh staining the back porch and i was back at work and i you know  mhh hmm   ya  i i don't know how i went through last year   no  a man's home is his castle  a woman's home is her hassle   very good ryan   what do you think  i think it's sexist  laugh   laugh ya ya  but  well it's because men will tend to let a lot of things go  ya  right  ya  it's not that i mean the   they will fix them eventually   ya  i think it's a matter of timing  ya   it's not that they're slobs  ya  although some of them are  it's just that eventually they'll  but eventually is is longer than it is for women  women will do it more they'll  deal with it more quickly it seems  gross generalization number forty-seven feigned voice   laugh   laugh who is that  it's only supposed to be two people   ya ya is there someone else in this room laugh    laugh   ya there's a lot to do   ya no i'm really i'm really  beginning to look at it because i i just don't have time to do what i have to do  mhh hmm  and like i say he's been really pushing me to uhm  to get sounds of english in to a publisher  if i do that next year i i can't  i can't have all these other things on  my shoulders   mhh hmm   mhh hmm no no  and i don't know what the solution is  i really do not know   your house is in good shape though over all isn't it  ya   and you don't have structural problems  you don't need to replace the windows  the roof is okay  no   ya  cough the basement doesn't leak   it's got a new furnace and a decent  water heater you know   mhh hmm   ya   ya it's all it's all  fine  mhh   uhm it just it's too much   for me with the workload i have  ya ya  you know full time job plus studying plus sometimes having a life  i think this is how the government keeps people under control  ahh  by encouraging them all to buy houses  ya  you see if you're if you buy a house you're so busy maintaining it you don't have time to  be politi politically   to be politically  active   then you're busy   to make trouble   ya   right you can just you're just absorbed   by all of the responsibility  i'm really getting pulled because you know we've talked about like buying something else or whatever whatever  i mean and it's all so hypothetical now anyways  hmm   you know we're still limping through the first few months  laugh you know  ya ya  whap huh oh it's okay  alright  and then we go through another round and then whap and  laugh then you know   mhh hmm mhh hmm ya   but uh  well the material world is  really it's a big number dealing with stuff  ya  you know you can really get get   your knickers in a twist you know sort of dealing with  the material world   ya   and i mean for two reasons   one is that you know were he to move in it would be more or less predominantly my house because it's been set up by me  mhh hmm  but uhm   so it'd be a symbolic thing actually  if you moved out then you ya ya   also if we moved in to our own place but you know that's a that's a big deal to do also   when you're still like when you're just in your  second year kind of of  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  you know to decide to  ya  so you know what at the same time i sort of see spending two to three years there and seeing how things go and uhm   mhh hmm mhh hmm   so maybe maybe he could build a little cabin in the corner of the garden   that would be totally his  ya  and then and then he could be the groundskeeper  i don't think he'd go for that  i thought you were gonna going to   to say he could he could set up his office there  in the corner   then you could then you could   write a book   you could write a book together and call it lady chatterley's lover or something like that   he's working on a book on statistics  statistics whistle   ya latent variable path in structural equation modelling  hmm  he's in psychology  ya  so wh wh why does he want  this is a new kind of statistical analysis ah approach or  it's a well what he's been doing and what he's doing ah ah like at the a p a american psychological association is he's giving workshops on sort of like advanced statistical procedures and approaches for uh researchers and uhm article reviewers  cough   mhh hmm mhh hmm  so they know what's going on  and and actually the publisher  asked him to write this book  mhh hmm   ya  hmm   uhm because well like because  he's been giving these workshops and i gather quite successfully  where does he go to give these workshops  a p a convention  oh okay   hmm  that's all over the world then  i mean you it's an international conference  uhh it's the american psychology association conference   ya ya   i i i suppose there could be people from all over the place ya  hmm  but i would s guess  <[primarily word   i didn't know that a p a had conferences  that's   i wonder what they talk about  well they have all kinds of workshops i can   sh show sh  show   the a p a manual  laugh they've got a they've got a  program guide this big  i forget how many people he told me on average are there  but it is like i think somewhere between ten to fifteen thousand maybe a little more ya people that attend this  ya   what  ya  ten to fifteen thousand people attend an a p a conference   i think so i think so   cough   we can call him and check laugh   what do they argue over how how to  wh wh how to do citations   no there's all people presenting papers uhm   doing giving workshops  and apparently the psychologists actually get credits because they've got to be constantly upgrading their skills or keeping  up with the newest things  uh huh   and uh what else do they do  uhm there's a there's a there's a  you know a psychology aid ah kind  of i don't know what show  is it like a   mhh hmm   what is it like the learned society or something  do th is there people there from different disciplines or is it only psychology  psychology i think  just psychology  ya   hmm   well   and they have things on on  drinking on teenagers on this this on everything  ya   huh   and then they got all kinds of products for psychologists like relaxation tapes you know   no kidding  ya they got a big showroom too  laugh that's really neat   well i'll tell you all about it because he's  taking me laugh   it's funny eh   ya where's the next conference  ya   well it's in new york  ya  august tenth to fifteenth we're going  wow  exciting   wow that's fun  well it's going to be nice to to  do something this summer  well ya i mean you you'll go to new york and you you don't have to work   you i mean for you it's  it's work   ya but i'm gonna going to   take his workshop  ya  cos i wanna want to   i wanna want to   i figure this is a really ga great   chance for me laugh to keep on top of my   what i studied in research  and i'm i'm really going uh  ya   ya sure   so can i ask you where you are in all of this   in your studies and  no i don't wanna want to  talk about it   you don't want to talk about it  huh i'm still i'm still trying to  figure out  well what i did today was i'm trying to get the money i put towards my thesis option in ed educational  tech technology freed towards my credits in adult   ed education   because there's three hundred and fifty dollars just sitting there  wow   mhh hmm  and they're telling me that unless i go back and do that  degree it doesn't count anymore  and i'm like i'm sorry there's something wrong here  mhh hmm  so i've gotta got to speak to  pam cook tomorrow  apparently if i can get a student request and it goes through the graduate whatever then maybe it can happen  mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm  so there's one thing i'm doing  ya th this   ya student request is a way to go   and then somebody and somebody and somebody ah is looking into the possibility of transferring more ed   educational tech technology credits into the dip diploma program
