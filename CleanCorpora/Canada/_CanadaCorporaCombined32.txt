 did you tell her that   laugh   no i didn't actually say that  i should have  oh god  laugh   no it's it's it's to have  to find out how you've been described  ya i guess that's what it is  ya   ya  i never agree with that  ya laugh   laugh usually i find that  ya like there's a part of me that thinks well maybe she should have just said well i don't know call her  laugh you know  laugh if you really want to know  ya   ya   ya it was pretty funny  on the other hand you know i kind of was uh it was  kind of a one of those very revealing moments for myself  where i thought wow this has really touched a nerve  and i you know by the time i was   on the metro getting home i was just laughing to myself  mhhm   i thought oh my god they must think i'm crazy  laugh   strange bird   laugh i guess i'm just staying at your place  laugh   strange bird exactly  ya it was funny  god snore   laugh yup yup yup   so what now  so oh so the long and short of this office thing is that uhm uhm i'm think i'm staying in this office and i'm going to be sharing it with heidi   oh  uh she teaches monday and wednesdays and i teach tuesdays thursdays and fridays  because with with sam we'd be  clashing words   ya no no you'd be bumping into each other  no i didn't ask him about louis' schedule  cos that was the other offer louis' office  but uhm i i don i don't  really have a problem sharing it  where is louis' office  right on that  it's where jane used to be  oh yes that's right   ya   over on the first part by the door  ya   ya  ya  ya so  do you know heidi at all  not really  no i i don't even know that i've spoken to her  the only time i've ever saw her uh was in faculty meetings   two years ago when i was full-time two years ago  mhhm   oh right  cos she wasn't here this year and last year i was part-time so i didn't have to go to those  right  laugh oh that's right  well you've done okay eh in terms of sort of keeping your  presence  ya   ya ya   that's good  that's very good   ya i think of it as a chapter in my life  ya  ya  i don't know where i really don't know where   i want to go with any of this  i'm very i really gotta  have got to confront it this summer  oh really  like h like make a move of some kind  mh hmm  huh   ya ya make a move in one direction or another  you know   > mhh   uh i know i have to make an income  that's the problem but uh  you know if i if i want to keep making films i'll have to i have to be in a different environment  so  and uh you know dumb question maybe you want to keep making films  well that's a question i have to ask myself  i i can i can't answer that because  until i finish this film i feel i can't i i can only think   i can't think beyond this next film which has to be made so  ya   it has to be made  ya  ya it has to be made   for your sanity  for my sanity plus i mean i i've  received money to do it and   oh that's right  it's been an ongoing thing  right right right  so it does have to come to some kind of conclusion and then you're   oh ya absolutely and and   then i think i'll be in a in a better position to know how i feel about uh my own sort of practice  ya  ya   but you know along with that i have so many other things that i want to begin to uh begin to really sink my teeth into  oh ya  ya  like what  well i wan want   i wanna want to go back to school  i want to study  uhm there i mean there are so many areas that i wanna want to uhm really examine thouroughly and not just from  you know i d whenever you work  on a project you do your own research  ya  and as a result of that i've researched a number of things but uhm i'd like be in a situation where i'm being guided through that process a bit more  right  i love the idea of reading lists  i love the idea of of someone  having to stand up there and somehow make this generate  this this in inquiry  yup that makes sense   mhhm  so uhm i i know i really need to get back to that but i'm just with everything else i just don't know how yet   right  and if uhm if we move at the end of next year then  uhm i don't know where that would be either  so it's all very you know all over the place  oh okay   oh there is that possibility  a good possibility ya   leaving montreal you mean  ya after next year because i'll be finished here  i mean my full-time thing  and uh craig will be finished his coursework  for his uh p h d which means he could go  anywhere else really to to work on his  thesis   oh   yup   yup   right   wow hmm   so we're you know we're  thinking nationally laugh   that's a possibility   sure  ya   so we'll see but uh i have to be clear i think about where i'm heading while i'm teaching full-time  right   i have to have i have to have  a plan in the works  right  so if it means applying to places or you know even just  to teach  ya to teach or i mean even to go somewhere to do ah you know some sort of ah artist in residency  or or   or kind of a a residency thing   or extended grant thing in the states or somewhere  mhhm   i feel like i have to take on a whole new challenge  i'm not uhm i'm not feeling challenged and i don't know how to challenge myself right now because my plate is so full  right   oh no i know   that it's the stuff that  that's sitting in on my plate  that doesn't you know that should be challenging me that isn't at this point in time because it's familiar  ya   yes  and i react to uh new situations more  you know i could sort of really feel inspired   well i've just been thinking a lot recently about just h like where does a sense of rejuvenation come from in what you're doing  you know  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   especially if something that you've been doing for a while  you know  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   because i mean if you talk about this project but then you add on the first project the other film well then  you're you'll be sort of w w   working in a  certain pool for a few years  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so then where do you  ya where do you take it at a certain point  i think that happens and you can really relate to that  ya   oh ya  i think it happens with everybody who works this way   maybe at different times in different ways but  yup   but that's a good question actually  to just even think of it as like you know like the idea of a residence or something  something that is not i mean it's not all-consuming  it's contained it's but   there's new imput of some  kind   uh huh   ya   ya ya  so i really have to try to ge get  some clarity if it's possible  i don't know if it is possible at this point but  i'm gonna going to see when i'm away if i'm   kinda kind of able to think about that stuff  mhh   yup  cos i i i'm feeling very  well you know i'm feeling like oh god one more  sort of one more job on this list and they just keep word i can't seem  t to i can't make them go away  deep breath   ya   and i desparately want that feeling that everything's done  for a while just so i can uhm rejuvenate  ya   so the the film that you're doing   now and the idea to go away this summer you want to finish it this summer  mhh hmm   well i wanna want to i  wanna want to finish uhm what this film is about how to proceed with finishing off the images so that uhm i can shoot it knowing that in my mind or on paper or whatever it's it's complete and i like it  word   mhhm   and then i can proceed with the shooting  now that that's a whole other thing  i was gonna going to say  words   that's about eight months full-time   oh my god   so i can't teach when i'm doing that anyway  i have to i have to just  do that  oh my god wow that's quite a   so i mean the u i unemployment insurance is  gonna going to work out very well for that  when you finish after next year  oh this is quite re it is a long term picture   ya it's very  this is the problem   you know it's ya like aw god  but that's the only way it can be done   hmm  i mean the my my   other option was to not take this next year  ya  what and why didn't you why did you laugh   and to struggle with with  uh   fear of you know not being able to generate an in   an income here in this city in this province in either way  uh that's real   that's real enough  so plus knowing that franz is   gonna going to be in school so one of us had to sort of keep things a little more  goin going   ya  ya   ya   so without with those two things  i mean i could have made the other decision  uh huh  i could have  it wasn't out of the question but   ya but i mean   becau because   but i took it thinking okay well this is it  this is this is a chapter  i'll take i'll do i'll do   this thing one more time then i will have taught here for four years and given it what i felt i could  mhhm   mhhm  uhm but i   you will have learned a lot too   ya oh ya ya  i mean you will have learned more in four years than you would have in two  that's true   you know what i mean like  mhhm   mhhm  because  ya ya  sort of the long haul  it seemed it seemed uhm  good to sort of go over these things again each year and develop stuff  absolutely   but you know and i was real curious about that  i really wanted to to  try that out  ya i could see that  so uhm ya  anyway  well i could see that  i mean you know and i mean  the the project is never not there   mhhm  unfortunately laugh   well no ya really   the days it's hanging around your neck laugh   but i mean like i don't know i mean   some sometimes for myself the issue just becomes i'm just worried that when i do have the time that  it's not gonna going to happen or it's not gonna going to   ya   but i mean it will so you know i mean  ya   i mean maybe that is a sort of an interesting year to i don't know lay some groundwork for something after at the same time you're   ya   ha laugh that's quite something really  ya ya i don't know but i d   i don't know   no were you at i i   don't know i think you i think uh you  will have learned a lot laugh   mhhm  you know  mhhm  even if i mean i don't know how you see yourself in terms of whether you're a good teacher or whatever or what but i mean even if you just see yourself as having been valuable really  valuable to certain people  laugh   mhhm   mhhm ya
