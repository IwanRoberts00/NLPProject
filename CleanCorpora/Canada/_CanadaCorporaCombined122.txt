 campbell   i do  i've been trying to get kyle stravitski to take me out to the ball game without having to pay for a ticket but it hasn't worked  yeah i've tried to drop hints left and right but no kyle  doesn't listen so   laugh you poor underprivileged kid you   ooh   and he's on vacation this week so he's not even listening right now in all likelihood  right   yeah not quite   not the time to make your pitch   no no no i'll have to wait until he gets back  traffic report   and uh due to the francofolie this week uh i just wanna  want to remind people that sainte - catherine street uh downtown closed between st-urban and jean-mans  that's right in front of complexe desjardins until august the fifteenth  so uh go out there and maybe just uh  yeah that's right there's so many festivals  just avoid it the whole summer   we're almost used to that though  between the jazz festival and everything just write that block off    but no you should go down there and hang out at the festival cos it's a lot of fun   just take the metro that's all  yeah   yeah exactly  safer way to go  thank you very much campbell jeffrey   campbell will check in again later with traffic  as we mentioned kyle stravitski is away this week but we've got xavier roth who's got a look at sports right now   eighteen minutes now past seven o'clock on daybreak  jeanne taylor is still scribbling furiously  taking note  of what the editorials re-   laugh   editing  editing   oh editing there you go laugh   um what's on in the editorial pages today  well i thought i'd start with that piece in la presse  local newspaper by simon du mont who is  who talks about the ongoing conflict at the casino which is still closed and he sa says the   the headline is the casino la mauvaise cause  or the wrong cause   he says uh the conflict there is one of the most unpopular labour management disputes in recent memory  and that you don't have to be anti-union to be unsympathetic with the demands uh being made by the union there for a four day week  he says the four day week is a good idea in theory but not practical at the casino  uh the workers there want to work thirty eight hours over four days but they want forty hours' pay  and uh du mont says that uh if you're  gonna going to want if you want a shorter work week you have to take a cut in pay  there's no two ways about it he says  yeah it certainly looks in many ways as though they were profiting from the great success of the casino that they went on strike so early into it's life  it was an incredible boom  they had to uh enlarge the parking lot over there almost immediately cos it was so crowded  but anyway he says this is economic nonsense and it comes and this is money out of taxpayers' pockets  since tax is- since casino revenue goes into the  consolida- ah consolidated government funds just like tax revenues   so he says he hopes that uh this arbitration proceeding that has been commenced will uh will put an end to it  and that they will follow the examples of the charles levoie casino workers who've already signed an agreement  a more reasonable agreement according to du mont   also in la presse uhm the editorial cartoon today  the caption reads the hole in the ozone is getting bigger  and the answer which is written in smoke uh above  peoples' homes there's sort of smoke coming out of the chimneys says  we don't  care   so uh i we haven't heard too much about the ozone and the ongoing uh discussion about that and  this is uh the editorial 's  position  we haven't even heard about it   so interesting to mention that that   la presse decided to mention that  hmm   no i remember even last year there was great   great talk about the hole being over over uh our region and even in the spring and in this year uh you know word    yeah   in le devoir claude-pierre rossignol  talks about the necessity for a massive restructuring of the state apparatus in quebec  ah he says it's important that the public sector ah be completely ah reorganized  says in fact quebecers want and consume more consumer goods uh than ever before  that the standard of living really hasn't dropped despite layoffs and uh recessionary sort of glitches  he says the problem is that quebecers want more luxury goods  uh trips v c rs home computers   and they also pay more taxes  so ahm he says the problem is that there's these two dynamics at work  and we want and to go along with that we want   increased services from the state and we can't have all those things  so there has to be a major restructuring of the health and uh education uh st services   uhmmm   that's interesting  i mean it's that that sort of take on things that we haven't heard  we shouldn't be feeling so sorry for laugh ourselves   i guess laugh   it's true   and finally i just thought i'd leave you with a note from the globe and mail that says that uh thinking uses up fifteen calories per hour  just thinking  doing nothing else but thinking   well goodness me  aren't we just burning like mad here this morning then  laugh   laugh   thank you very much for your calorie burning exercise  this morning   talk to you later   that's jeanne taylor   it is just twenty-one minutes now past seven o'clock on daybreak  music   mmm  tossing frisbees around and laugh   oh yes  and uh good news in traffic too alana   things are working still uh very well in from the west island and southshore and laval  also from vaudreuil hudson three lanes open eastbound on the trans canada  and soon that construction will be over so just hold on cos that will soon be finished  also watch out for fog patches coming in from outlying areas  they are slowly burning off though  yeah it's looking a little hazy as again we've got our video picture of the city out there  yeah   well that should burn off to give us a sunny day  a high of thirty degrees  so another lovely day much like yesterday  and as promised another one tomorrow  so let's hope we can deliver on that  so far so good   kristeen ball 's our reporter in sweden where she watched yesterday's big race and she joins us live  and kristeen the fastest two men in the world this year are canadians  they are basking in the glory right now but i guess they don't have a lot of time to celebrate because bailey and surin will be taking part in another big race later this week  that's right  they've uh got their pictures on the front page of every swedish newspaper over here but already their thoughts are turning to the four by one hundred men's relay race  now the first round is going to be held on saturday but even before then uh team canada has to announce who is going to run alongside of bruny and donovan  it's a four man team  we can expect an announcement either later today or tomorrow  and it's going to be exciting especially xavier because  americans dennis mitchell and carl lewis are out of contention altogether with injuries  there was a possibility they could run  they were favoured to win the gold but with them out it looks like  maybe another gold medal for canada  and uh still with sprinting lynford christie who did not place at all in the men's one hundred metre yesterday he has a hamstring injury  he went down at the end of the men's one hundred metre and we're still waiting word on the severity of that injury  hmm  now canada of course is celebrating however graham hood of oakville ontario uh one of our top middle distance runners will not be taking part at this year's world's  no he's disappointed and the entire canadian team is disappointed because it was going to be sort of a a   two-pronged thrust for canada in the men's fifteen hundred with graham hood and kevin sullivan  but word this morning from england where graham has been recovering from a hamstring injury that he suffered in an eight hundred metre race in sheffield earlier it's just too severe  he's been working with physiotherapy and light workouts but he can't run the race that he would like to so he has withdrawn altogether  so it's just gonna going to be kevin sullivan to keep an eye out for later this week  and what's the situation with our our   decathlete michael smith  well i've got an update for you there xavier   after seven events michael of kenora has moved up now he's in fourth place with dan o'brien the very famous american decathlete still out in front with a sizeable lead in first place and right now they're just getting the pole vault competition underway  thanks kristeen   you're welcome  that's kristeen ball reporting live from the world track and field championships in sweden   so pretty by the cranberries  well it's hard to start thinking about wool sweaters and winter coats when you're wearing shorts and a t-shirt but it's almost that time of year again  the fall clothes are hitting the stores right about now  and we wanted to find out what to expect in the coming months so we sent daybreak's marie mcdonald out to check out all the new fall fashions and she joins me now in the studio  good morning marie   hi alana   hey  well i went out and visited angela buccarro montreal designer angela buccarro yesterday  i actually went to her her office up  in ah in saint leonard which is also her studio and her warehouse so as you can imagine it was it was oh yeah laugh yeah there was just bolts of of   you know colourful wools and chenille lying around and paper patterns on cutting tables and racks and racks of fall merchandise just waiting to be shipped out  all happening there   now i wanted to quiz her on what we'll be seeing in stores  but first i had to find out what we won't be seeing  you know the grunge look has been finished  i don't think people wanna want to look like that anymore  and you know it's it's so bizarre because for a time in fashion i mean i i did that thing too i mean i did the grunge look so i'm guilty also  but it's so funny because you know you can spend a lot of money and you look poor  but this season i think it's going more towards this hollywood glamour  this nineteen forties uh appeal like the green coat i showed you with the big shawl collar and the big pockets and the tabs on the pockets  a real man man's cashmere coat  that's a spin-off of nineteen forties where women look glamorous  well glamorous  from courtney love to joan crawford i guess in one year  now all that talk of glamour if that's back in and women are looking more like women uh how will that translate into what we'll see in the stores  i guess no more plaid no more baggy jeans no more scrappy sort of stuff  but what'll be replacing them  well we'll start with the colours for fall because we're going uh back to the basics it looks like  no more baby blues or baby pinks or whatever so much  didn't see much in the way of the metallics either that were popular for a while  i in terms of colour we're   gonna going to be seeing a lot of what angela bucarro calls the forest colours  so you can imagine that the the rich greens of the trees and the burgundies and the chocolate brown that either you look great in   earth tones exactly rust and of course lots of black  as always   earth tones   i was thinking i look like death in all of those   oh great   laugh you gotta  got to find one colour there's usually one colour that   or one one shade or so  that everybody looks good in  that you're safe with   yeah
