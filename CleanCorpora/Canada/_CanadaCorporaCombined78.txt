 uhm i got the impression like they didn't  wanna want to get   the i ge i go i get   the impression from her maybe it's because she's pregnant but i  i pick up this vibe from her that she's  she has a a fear like oh it's gonna going to be a really long hard winter idea  is that strange like i just  no   no i don't get that feeling from her at all  i think ya   from him too like you know like   no i didn't get that feeling at all i think it was more in terms of is it necessary   are you being overboard in saying that we really need this stuff y'know you know   and uh that's the impression i got from her cos i   when i originally spoke to her about it she goes oh well oh well and y'know you know   we've never really had this problem before and oh f  for last year it was fine  uh maybe you're being a little overboard and  y'know you know and   god   so y you know they uh they eventually she's got her winter tires now and she's having no problem now but that that  first week was pretty bad period for all of us you know i mean  mhm   and she is pregnant and she has a forty  month old baby and you know it's not a time  it's not a time for her to to  get stuck y'know you know  so   oh i know i know   i know i know   but she did get them finally  i don't know i just picked up this   they got em them ya  but i mean it wasn't like to save money or anything   clear throat just   ya   was it  well i four or five words no i think money is part of it you know  no i can't imagine   is it necessary  is this gonna going to happen twice the winter for us to justify buying this  i think money is part of it   mhm   ya they seem to be quite uh not not   uh cheap but you know conscious of how they're spending their money  thrifty  ya   and uh i have no idea  well the house is only about a thousand f   oh well never mind but laugh   ya laugh   i mean the house is kinda kind of  big for them  ya   for the two of them you mean  ya  well they're gonna going to have two kids  they'll have they have uh  zachary   they yes yes it's zachary   zachary's not his name  samuel   the the baby now and then  the uh the baby baby's gonna going to  come   so that's four in the house that's   and they have their office  it seems so immense that house   it's cos   no it's not any larger than your house  they have downstairs they have a   uhm a g well finished well down   finished   that richard p turned it into a spare bedroom  just before they left to sell the house now that's what he uses as his office   mhm   now the rest of it downstairs not really finished  there's the entrance way that sort of has a subfloor on it  there's two bedrooms   two finished bedrooms   and on the main level there's like a you know like you have  it's almost like a double living room   you know you have like  although yours is more together it's  le theirs is less of the open concept  ya   changing the subject  what do you think of this   this is what i would do if i didn't have to worry about money  but i've be no but i've been really  thinking about it three or four words   laugh you want my wish list laugh   no no but i've really been thinking about it   in terms of uhm in terms of uh keeping the heat in the house and tur and and making  a tax deductible space out of the sunroom  okay  you know in between the living room and the sunroom  i was thinking about putting in   uh you know how when this house say was an original there would have been french doors  ya  and in between the glass sometimes instead of having wood in between the glass i saw these incredible doors they're new but they go great in a heritage house they have just like little pieces of brass  little strips of brass it's a really nice wood frame  ya ya ya   ya  and then it's partitioned glass   and you can get those that don't have door   well like when you first buy a door it doesn't have a hole for the door knob right  mhm   so you could get the panels to close it in and then have like a section where two doors open  mhm right   so all the light would come through  ya  and then i was thinking because it's because i would like to do dirtier work in my studio and i would like to have a drawing room and an office in the sunroom  oh that'd be word   ya   and i figure   you could you could  get uhm those louvre doors the pocket doors   you're gonna going to get those panels the way they are right  you could have the whole the whole  wall that's just the panels with the glass and then you'd just open into the pockets   so it would stay lit  well i   y'know you know it would stay lit  well there are no pockets cos it's a log house  three or four words retract   where would you where would they go  when they retract   well you put the there are   rails that you put up  there are rails that you put up   oh so they just overlap  ya sort of  ya ya  ya so  like you know where the aquarium is  that would be like permanently sealed off  ya mhm  and where those two little side things are that would be like a permanent piece  ya  and then the other part could like slide right back  stretch back into it ya  that'd be neat one or two words   cos that's the front of the house and   well it just was it was just that when i was working last fall like i kept i couldn't  draw in my studio and work in my studio telephone rings   mhm  anyways i think brian thinks that's just a disgusting idea and that we still need a word playroom for cory word but it's like doesn't mean  cory can't play in there it just means that   because i don't like to heat up my studio when i have to draw in the winter and i thought that it would make my workspace more part of the house space   ya   and i   plus you could just have it as a just a  separate place period in the house and it would   cos the open concept with those rooms   and then when we had company   it sounds it sounds  like it's really bugging you right now the open concept stuff  oh ya   you talk about it a lot   so that would break it up  but y again if you have people that are having company it could act more like a spare bedroom and  except for if you had a party which  i mean how often do you have a party  it people could still be in there and  y'know you know or   i like you know there's one thing about our our h beep from an answering machine round house our multigon house   i'm not crazy about  i really as a as a living style i like to have more uh private confined spaces   oh i know i know completely  i'd like to have a house that has like  completely i it's   y'know you know   ya   i really uh that's one thing i regret  about that house  it's like you all have to be together all the time  ya  but even still that'd be fine if you have that  it's like you have to be or you'd have to be  a little bit richer laugh have a little more opulence around and have the uh another section built  uhm so that there's there's more like  casual reading   just just quie   i love it the small little rooms  i love small little rooms where  little y'know you know you can go off and one or two words   i know why do we like small why do you like a small room when you wanted a big open space  well myself i had no choice   well the word   i just moved into it  ya  well i wanted both cos i like the big open space   so there was a it was a choice when we first started to design the house   i didn't really want uh that open concept   but as the nature of the house you you   kinda kind of have to do it  if you close it off you blow that the  effect that upper effect of of all the light and all the space and the openness y'know you know    so unless you have enough money to get a really big version and then leave thi that half of the house as like a semicircle and really open and everything  you you don't really have a choice  mhm   but that's one thing i regret  i like having more like little alcoves and  and those types of things but   mhm   anyway but you can do that  that'd be good  like like coralee's place   yes  that that separate little room where you can go  ya ya   it's it's really civilized   it's good to be able to go and do that   ya ya   actually i was thinking like right now i was thinking that the computer could be in there   and that when cory came home from school or had friends like   ya   i would call it my drawing room  i would i would like to like  pull out the carpeting and put in a good wood floor  mhm ya  and uh   see if he stays into music   you can also turn it into a a little music room   ya  a conservatory   and if you had the computer set up in there you can eventually put in synthesizers words   no i just don't think see   why everything has to always s stay the same   synthesizers  laugh   well he likes keyboards already  do you think so  ya  ya that's that's definitely a  uh a stimulation for him  it motivates him during the lessons if he can go to the piano  it's definitely a whole other concept for him   like there's the singing and the drumming and all that stuff  mhm   but he's much more tuned in to it if he  y'know you know relates it to the piano  and understands a scale now  mhm  dfinitely understands a scale  and uh it's neat because a keyboard is very uhm uh  open  it's very receptive  you can see you can see  everything   it's a little bit much to lug around  it isn't like a tin flute   well no in a in a  synthesizer version no one has real  laugh   well in hotels or whatever they have real pianos but unless you're very very very very up there in the music scene you don't   you don't travel with a piano  you travel with uhm uh a synthesizer and an electric piano  you know you travel with keyboards but you don't travel with the actual big huge pianos   you know unless you happen to be a millionaire   but uh but those types of things  cos they they they there are programs now where you can write music and it plays it can play  the music you write directly from your computer onto your synthesizer   and would you think he's that  so   well of course you would   no no not now of course no   now he's not   no like   but i mean i i can't imagine i can't imagine   like i would like to put him in some kind of music lessons cos i think it's a real discipline  ya  uhm so that's why i started   but not at this age  you can't think of music as a  i mean if you grow up one or two words    next year he'll be eight   eight is old enough for for piano lessons isn't it
