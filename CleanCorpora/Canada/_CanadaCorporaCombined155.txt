 is the required denunciation of custody different for native young offenders   the honourable secretary of state for training and youth  madam speaker i do believe that there's equal application of the law applied under the young offenders  uh i think that uh because of the rate of recidivism and the higher rates of uh incarceration for probably aboriginal peoples generally as i indicated the uh the uh the rate of incarceration exceeds uh the population level of aboriginal people for  for men in particular  i'm not sure that that pertains to to  young offenders but i would uh i would venture that it would be very close  having said that i don't think there's any special treatment  uh if there is any special treatment it's to create equality not to create inequality  that's because there's such inconsistencies and there's such marginalization right now that definitely there is a constitutional disadvantage applied to young aboriginal people if that is the case in fact  resuming debate  repeats in french   french introduction   french, 20 minutes applause   order  it is my duty pursuant to standing order thirty-eight to inform the house that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows the honourable member for hochelaga-maisonneuve monsieur  menard sur les droits de la personne   french partial statement   i'm sorry  the honourable member for new westminster-burnaby   thank you speaker  i'd like to address a question to my colleague  uh does he believe that the proposed amendments to the young offenders act in this bill go in the right direction and if he does not then what legislative provisions would he propose in addition to the usual   re request for more social programming and counselling services  if the bill says the wrong things and i believe he's taking that tack then what does he propose other than throwing more money at the problem with increased social services  french introduction  french, 3 minutes 20 seconds   questions and comments  the honourable member for berthier-montcalm   french, 2 minutes 30 seconds   french introduction  french, 1 minutes 50 seconds   resuming debate  the honourable member for swift current- make  maple creek-assiniboia   thank you madam speaker   two months ago ten years almost to the day after the passage of the young offenders act christopher bartleby was shot down in cold blood on an ottawa sidewalk   because he was the person who shot him was   a young offender we know very little bit very little about him   all we know is that he shot a man for a lark for fun   there was a big public outcry lots of calls for tougher law enforcement and the media and the usual brown shirted brigades of gun control lobbyists were braying that we should stop crime by getting tough on honest citizens   this is something like a man who has two dogs one vicious and one gentle   the vicious dog bites the postman and so to appease the postman the man shoots the gentle dog and then takes the vicious dog and tries to sweeten his temperament by overfeeding it   so what will happen to this young man   uh because of the date of the crime i presume that he will be tried under the old young offenders act but for the sake of this discussion let's say that he would be tried under the new one   now it's less likely under the new act than under the old that he will be tried in an adult court for the simple reason that the new law will lead to interminable court delays with new process of reverse onus that has been written into it   if he is convicted he will face a maximum of ten years in custody no minimum of which perhaps six years could be in closed custody  but judging on the way the laws have been enforced to date that's all rather hypothetical and somewhat unlikely  so what should be done with a person like that   now i respectfully suggest that murder by a sixteen year old is no less harmful to the victim than murder by an eighteen year old  therefore the penalties should be essentially the same   i am not suggesting immediate incarceration with older prisoners  where the young fellow would be the plaything of sexual predators  that constitutes cruel and unsual punishment by any standards  and is unworthy of a civilized society  but we should have institutions designed to serve specific age groups  we used to have these  they were called reform schools   now some honourable members may say oh but that's too expensive  we can't afford it  if we could rehabilitate some of these young hoodlums perhaps it would be money well spent   and it shouldn't be expensive anyway  it needn't be expensive because young people incarcerated in a reform school could do useful work including growing their own food which  prisoners adult prisoners in the penitentiaries used to do also and which we've done away with in most cases  why do we not go back to that   and when the young offender wasn't working to earn his keep he should be educated   go easy on the pool tables and t v  you know a fourteen year old young offender who is in open custody was recently quoted as saying it's easy time   quote continues   what is that young fellow learning about the justice system   now the proposed amendments to the young offenders act are in our opinion purely cosmetic a transparent attempt to pacify a public which is clamouring for meaningful change   the government's response to almost everyone's principal demand that the maximum age of application be lowered from seventeen years to fifteen years is to be sloughed off with a silly and meaningless compromise  requiring sixteen and seventeen year olds to establish through a tedious and expensive court process that they should not be tried in adult court for the most serious crimes murder attempted murder aggravated sexual assault and so on   the cost and confusion will be enormous a bonanza for lawyers  and since both reverse onus and judicial selectivity are involved some lawyers will probably be able to seek the spotlight and beef up their incomes by mounting a charter challenge   this is an act written by lawyers for lawyers   i think of the constituent who said rather plaintively  can't you pass a law down there forbidding lawyers to run for parliament    now in this house on june the sixth the honourable member for saint hubert said these motions will be similar to extradition proceedings   quote continues   now i rarely agree with anything the honourable member says but i certainly agree with that  she was spot on   of course her proposed solution differs from mine  she would continue to treat these louts like poor little misguided children subject to the same rules as thirteen and fourteen year olds   people of sixteen and seventeen aren't children for heaven's sake  they hold down jobs  they drive cars   they have babies with or without benefit of matrimony   and if they're unhappy in the parental home generous social welfare will in most provinces provide reasonable comf   reasonably comfortable independence   bill c thirty-seven rather than ensuring that these older young offenders will end up in adult court makes it less likely than ever because of the reasons i have cited   now i don't want to sound like a nagging parent saying when i was your age but at the age of seventeen i was working in a bush camp  swinging an axe to raise money so i could enter university and if anyone had dared to suggest to me that i was a child i would have been outraged  we do young people no favours by relieving them of responsibility  at the other end of the scale i can actually remember uh one of the honourable members opposite probably won't believe this but i can remember when i was ten to thirteen years old  my companions and i fought regularly but never dreamed of using the knives which as farm boys we all carried   we didn't try to maim each other   and we had an archaic code of conduct which might seem terribly quaint to the lawyers and social workers who have been trying to redesign our society   you didn't kick somebody who was down  you didn't pick on little kids or gang up on anyone and you never never never hit girls  in other words we knew the difference between right and wrong   so did my kids as recently as twenty years ago  and so i venture to say to the young savages who terrorize their weaker classmates vandalize property and give the finger to their powerless teachers to exempt ten and eleven year olds from the rules of civilized conduct is socially destructive madness  a child who gets away with it at ten or eleven years of age and whose parents aren't held legally accountable for his or her actions learns a lesson which all the prattling counsellors and dreamy eyed social workers in the world can't erase   now the minister tells us that section forty-three of the criminal code which protects parents who do care about their kids and use reasonable force to discipline them is up for review   what strange world does the liberal party inhabit   mister speak madam speaker  the road from uncorrected naughtiness to mean destructiveness to full   blown blown delinquency is short and it's straight  the government owes it to the children of canada and to the future of our society to re-enter the world of every day canadians   c thirty-seven is a start but only a start  let's get on with it  madam speaker i neglected to inform you that i am splitting my time  with the honourable member from red deer  i hope i can put that in now  i agree to accept it but you have already gone over  i i think we better get to questions and comments  questions and comments  all right  the honourable member for berthier-montcalm  french, 1 minute 45 seconds   the honourable member for swift current-maple creek-assiniboia   i thank the honourable member for his questions  uh he must be aware that reform schools or youth wings as he calls them do not exist anywhere in canada any more  uhm and i am advocating and i'm advocating strongly that doing away with them was a mistake because there is now no real mechanism to deal with these young people  you have the open custody situation or you have jails for adults  you really don't have much in between  you have youngsters in remand centres interminably  and uh they get into more trouble there  they get educated  that's why we should have reform schools where they get proper  education  and yes i am nostalgic   i do yearn for a period of our history when society was orderly when there was a discipline of children when the police and the courts had power and exercised it   uh i don't uh have a yearning for a police state but i do have a yearning for a state where people are safe where there is a social contract which involves decency a mutual respect among people  we have lost that and a lot of it is due to the same frame of mind that framed the original young offenders act and which did not have the courage to come forward and do a full job with c thirty seven   resuming debate  the honourable member for red deer  thank you madam speaker  canadians have waited a long time for this day  for years they have been demanding substantial changes to the young offenders act  canadians say they uh do not feel protected  they have asked the government to put society first instead of the criminal  canadians have demanded changes and canadians have waited  in the meantime there have been costs  the public confidence has been eroded  young offenders who have been released for violent crimes have reoffended  all the while canadians have appealed to the government to protect society and ensure offenders are rehabilitated before being released  the government has tabled before us amendments to the young offenders act which it says will address these concerns  the amendments would change the declaration of the young offenders act so that its primary objective is to protect society  madam speaker on the surface this looks good   the protection of soc society  should always be the objective of our criminal justice system  we as parliamentarians must ensure that the protect  protection of canadians is paramount
