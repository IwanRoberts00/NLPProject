 but actually uh he was uh what i saw   of of his quotation was mainly regarding safety nets which uh are applied in other provinces but here uh are applied in the form of uh of our crop insurance and our stabilization  cos our programs and their programs don't exactly fit together  so they're gonna going to   how do you say always a a difference there    and i think that's probably why the reason is and they figured it'd be just easy if they gave the the budget over and they'd do what they want  are they right  well the way the the producers seem to want here  they obviously they sound like they're right  are they right in the long run that's for us to see  response and explination of political problem   then why would we bother to have a national milk program  and you know the it's not very coherent  actually  agreement and continual political commentary   and farmers have done a pretty good job at that we must admit  but when are we gonna going to get an answer to this  this seems like this was a question that comes up every month or so  historical analysis of political problem   hmh  historical analysis of political problem   yeah but just remember it may may  be unequal in one program but then in another uh you may get more  exactly   so uh in the end uh i i think it smooths out pretty pretty evenly  hunting season has begun  bob what's it like around your farm in the middle of hunting season  well i i took a run downtown this morning and i counted five deer decorating various vehicles just on the way down there  so we're really in the middle of deer hunting  but you know deer hunting has really changed eh over the past uh very few years  ehm you know it's it's it's a  it's a little bit like golf eh eh  you know executives try to work off their pots at playing golf and then they came out with golf carts  and uh then people mowed their lawn and this was good exercise and then they came out with these little tractors they sit on and  and there went the exercise  and now hunters uh have these little tree huts and uh they just sit in those all day and uh they just sit in those all day and uh uh wait for the deer to come out  and even worse than that there were a whole bunch of people along our roads here that sell deer apples  and uh these are apples tha that  uh you know in not very good apples in bulk  and they put these out to attract the deer  and get them to come close to their cabins  there  and uh as soon as the deer comes close to eat his apples they shoot it  and that's what hunting is  but but there's a big advantage to that  it it's taken away a lot of the hunter traffic from the farms actually  you don't see all these people going around  phrase   oh i guess   that's right  now they they're sitting in one tree static   they sitting yes  and you know where they are  you just stay away from that tree  so there's an advantage to it  but it's not much it's not much of a sport i don't think  personally uh uh it looks pretty wimpy  how bout about you genie   well it's pretty quiet around here  we have our club which has been very effective uh for us  and patrollers do go out and we we   try and keep the hunters at at you see we do have hunters on our property but they're ones that go through the club and if you are not part of the club well then you're just not welcome  and uh since we have been working that way and   we've had quite peaceful time and uh   but but your hunters actually move  do they  pardon   your hunters actually move  they they don't just sit   oh no no why bob is quite right  you see these silly little plastic things in trees and they've got seats to sit on that are made out of materials that keeps their you-know-what warm and uh  oh no there ah there isn't necessarily the uh exise exercise to it anymore  i'm i'm quite agreeable with uh  with bob   they must look like these giant caterpillar cocoon things up in the trees sitting up there  well they're a they're a tree rest i guess you'd call em them   but uh i don't see the point of it either  but that's beside the point  how bout about you stew   huh the biggest dislocation uh from hunting season so far is uh the fact that they keep stealing my gazette local newspaper  laugh   uh uhm  who steals your gazette  uhm word months ago through this program  laugh   well now we know what they're doing up there in their little tree houses  laugh   they're reading  they're they're reading stew's  gazette laugh   laughs and responds to joke   laugh   laugh   laugh   it's not funny   you're that's why you're so angry  ya you got it right on  laugh   yeah   oh my word   i hear there's pregnancy testing happening laugh on your farm bob   yeah well that's the time of year for pregnancy testing   you'd be amazed what i hear around here   laugh   laugh   it's the time of year for testing  that's the time of year because they've been running with the bull not " bulls" uh since the spring and uh and uh  when you bring your cows in you sort of want to know which ones   are are pregnant and which ones are not  and in the case of the ones that aren't very good  if they're not pregnant you ah you just ship them for meat  now you're talking about beef cattle of course  we're talking about beef cattle  yes i'm sorry i should have specified that  i did  yeah  we did a bunch of yearlings  uh last saturday it was such a gorgeous day and we just uh  i think we had about twenty of them  and what we do we do them ourselves and  uh it uh it's a rectal examination  you just put your hand down in there and if the cow bites your fingers you know there's a calf inside  ughh that's not true  well almost  is it  yup  and laugh those that we're not sure of like you know   if if we can't feel the calf we'll just put them aside for the vet and have the vet go over  it might mean a a sterility problem or something like that  puff laugh   which we'd like to know about  genie we'd heard a story on our news a good story a good news story about a couple of s q uhm  s&circumflex;ret&eacute; quebec qubec police service  constables who were driving around and they smelt smoke in  in your area  yeah   at roden  yes they actually saved the people uhh from burning  uhm   which is always uh is always great news and uh you know everyone's so happy that they were just  happened be at the right place at the right time  but and we're very lucky to uh to have these police out ah doing their patrolling  and uh it shows that they do a good job eh  yeah that's right  they woke the people up broke into the house   woke them up  it was a uhm man woman and a teenage son  that's right  mhm   and uhm   was this out in the country genie   yes it is  yeah fire is a terrible thing out there eh  oh it fire's a terrible thing anywhere and ah i guess it well like i said just so lucky that those police were patrolling that area at that time  mhm   and uh did smell something  yeah   all of you thank you for being with us  we'll talk to you next uh tuesday    kay okay take care  bye  bye bye   bye   been speaking to our farm panel of genie neveue   she's a dairy producer in roden  that's in the lanaudi&egrave;re region   bob hebert is a beef and sheep producer in danville  in the eastern townships  and stew maynard is the executive director of the quebec  farmers' association   now from montreal free-for-all on the source a m eight hundred c j a d  free-for-all with tim smith alan rinaldi  eliza green and george fraser discussing something in the news  uh yesterday was such a hot uh day in all of the politics with the guy bertrand thing and the emergency cab  cabinet well emergency chuckle chuckle cabinet meeting    and uh laugh emergency but mister landry didn't bother to stay for it  and when it was all over they announced that what they've decided is nothing anyway  uh there was the cabinet meeting there was the report by mister c&circumflex;t&eacute;  there was the going back and forth between mister bouchard and mister chr&eacute;tein  and tim suggested this morning he said  you know who's maybe not looking so bad in all of this is daniel johnson  remember him  he was premier of quebec at one time for seven or eight months  and he's the leader of the opposition and he was the leader of the no forces in the referendum  we   i should explain that as far as m  many of the english community are concerned he's not nearly vociferous enough  not nearly hardline enough   laugh no kidding   but as far as mainstream is mainstream   quebec is concerned he's ideally positioned  he's right smack-dab in the middle of this thing  uh the mad majority of  que quebecers and so is john charest uh the majority of quebecers don't believe that ottawa or any other part of canada should have any say in quebec's uh constitutional future  uh as as well the majority of quebecers don't like guy bertrand and think he's a buffoon a clown    i'm not speaking for mims myself   now i'm just telling you how the french speaking  mainstream are thinking   i i understand you   we we heard your disclaimer    uh which is why i wou   would which is why i'm sensing  picking up signals that daniel johnson alone of all the politicians in this thing seems to be steering a a  cautious and central course  well uhm i have trouble with someone who steals a cautious and central course in this one and it seems to me quite apart from being in tune with the mainstream of opinion which sometimes is good and sometimes is not uh that johnson has has taken what looks to me like a very troublesome line in most of this  and there's two issues that come to mind  one of them is the whole case of fraud in in   the referendum where johnson has left all of the leadership to a very very junior backbencher who who's done a good job  but i have to ask why the leader of the no committee hasn't been active on this issue inhale   you're talking about tom mulcair  yeah  and and the other one that   that bothers me very much is he is simply fitting into the mainstream by adopting the the separatist line  and and he's indicated he's prepared to consider a unanimous resolution a affirming   quebec's position  and i find for him to be taking a separatist line might be in touch with mainstream opinion but it doesn't strike me as making him a very effective leader of the federalists  it's my guess that uh mainstream separatist  mainstream quebec opinion is mainstream french press  uh am i right in your analysis   french media   french media   french media   i was watching lapine last night  on la pointe   okay   okay   just let me uh just let me finish    okay   i was just watching t v a as well   yeah   so that now i don't figure that most of the media is mainstream uh the way quebecers think  uh i think daniel johnson has been just the opposite  i don't think he's been playing this very well at all  i think he's been trying to pull a bourassa  and that's falling down on both sides of the fence  and the only thing you get when you sit on the fence is splinters  he has to come down on one side or the other  he's afraid to alienate the nationalist vote  he's afraid to say he's a diehard federalist even though i  i believe i know that to be true  he's afraid to uhh put off this one  he's afraid to put off that one  he comes out sounding like a separatist on one hand because uh ottawa has no business in quebec's future  and on the other hand  i mean he's on the one hand on the other hand  i feel like i'm watching fiddler on the roof  i'd rather watch somebody who's a strong leader with whom i disagree but at least i know where i stand than daniel johnson   who who i i believe has not been taking a strong stand
