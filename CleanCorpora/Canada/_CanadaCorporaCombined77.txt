the end of that i kept thinking like he's not going he's not going yet  and i was just like trying to break up the relationship cos  i didn't wanna want to be i knew i had to but i didn't do it  this is really an awful period like i just   it was the most fucked up i've been   well it was just surprising y'know you know  to to hear all that because you're usually not someone that hangs around and puts up with   word you us you're usually mhm   oh no no it's made me a lot of what i am now   but nobody knew what was going on  nobody knows any of that  mommy i don't think wants to know it   dianne never had the time to hear it and   billy   hm   i don't think anybody has any idea  nobody i mean i i if i really sat down and thought about it to tell somebody what went on   it was it was probably   maybe i was like trying to live on the edge or something like that   anyways so then so then   they ca they were coming back you know   it was the end of the summer and he still hadn't gone  and so i wasn't really making my own plans cos i was tied up with this guy who you know and uh   and then it was so we had to move somewhere in september because they were coming back  and so we moved into we we took  we t we took like a downward move into like a group house around the glebe somewhere where a girlfriend of mine was that she was organizing it   and uhm i kept thinking okay

moves it was just like move move move y'know  you know   anyways by m by february  he like threw me across the room and there happened to be this teeny little like shoebox apartment beside her apart  the apartment that we lived in and i moved out that afternoon and just left him  right mhm  it was a   so you've never heard from him again or  oh i once or twice just like made eye contact with him like somewhere at a crowded place and like just left and   he leaned over from the chairlift and whipped me on the leg with his ski pole and i had this bruise that went from like here around to my buttock this welt and bruise and   the morning the day i moved out he we   were having this like screaming fight right  like i never cry any more even when i'm arguing with jeff   we're having this like screaming fight and he   it was just after my birthday and he threw these mitts that he had given me and he i was cooking bacon he threw these mitts at me and they fell in the pan and the grease spattered all over and i started to like sob cry and   and anyways he was sitting away from me smoking a cigarette  and i i said aww pierre expresion and i like i was  s   it was so awful what was happening this v verbal fight that i i put i tried in a very loving way to put my hands down on his shoulders  and he goes stomping sound like he pushed back really hard and the chair flew back and he like pushed up like he like  e ejected off the floor   and he pushed up and he turned around and he picked me up by my shoulders and he and he just like threw me  and i felt like this figure in a chagall painting   just like going sideways across the room   ya laugh   so anyways i moved out this afternoon  god it makes me like inhale exhale   eew ya   got any stories like that  two or three words  laugh n no no i don't have those kind of stories at all   isn't it awful and you know what like  i can't believe like my sister doesn't even know this   i mean like people have heard like he picked me up and he like threw me across the room but like nobody   ya   for a distinct period in your life i remember him coming to bill and dar 's house in laval and uh for for one fam  ya for one family function he seemed like a a very nice guy    my life was so f  ya   and couldn't he couldn't he be charming ya   y'know you know like we have one set of family function pictures with this odd guy in it that  we don't really know   ya   we don't know much about him or you or  with him or whatever   ya   but uh   we really had a lot in common  i mean he really enjoyed he was very  creative and i got really s sucked into this family being creative and we both skiied and and um we had wonderful conversations and we would read together even though he   was y'know you know just had  a high school education  i mean it was just   but we but i   there was schizophrenia in the family   i can't actually even remember what happened then because   i know we were living in another apartment on dalhousie  pronounced dal-who-sie too  it was awful  and then his brother came to live with us when we were living on dalhousie  now where did the dalhousie apartment get in there   i don't know  i'd have to actually like look at a calendar   i'd i'd have i'd have to look at a date book and sort of figure like there were like five moves in a year there   it was really  does everybody in ottawa call dalhousie   pronounced dal-how's-ie dalhousie  pronounced dal-who-sie   i don't know what did i call it  laugh   dalhousie dal-who-sie   i've never heard it called dalhousie  dal-who-sie until i was moved to  ottawa.  dalhousie dalhousie dal-how's-ie   i call it dalhou  dalhousie dalhousie dalhousie dal-who-sie   because it's dalhousie dal-how's-ie  dalhousie dal-how's-ie university   oh uh i i call it both  you call it both  yep   oh i remember now   earlier matt monopoly   okay the other thing was scrabble   oh but he cheats   and but uh that's it exactly he cheats  but uh one one day we were playing scrabble with a group of people and he came up with this word  y'know you know   he had a zed  wanted to use a zed  got all these kajillion points and wanted to use all his letters and he came up with a word and put on the board this word called zwililogy right  and matt is so credible and so kind and everybody thinks he's such a nice guy and right   so he ended up putting this word down and nobody wanted to seriously challenge him on it right  so that mm  they didn't want to give up their turn   so they said matt what's  zwiliogy   and he says oh it's a baby sperm whale   and everybody went oh okay and accepted it  but that's the kind of stuff he does   and he does that to your dad all the time   he sucks him in like crazy all the time   so laugh anyway while driving up to nils '  and betty 's house one day he told them that he had to   walk out for er watch out for the moose  because uhm the moose would stand in front of the cars and   and   what moose   well exactly what moose   matt told nils   he told your father going up to  betty and nils ' house  they were driving up to their house all these stories about moose and everybody is laughing their heads off and he's sitting there like literally looking for the moose and afraid all this stuff is gonna going to happen but it has nothing to do at all with what would normally happen up there and he should know better you know but matt convinced him   oh   but that's he does that all the time  it's lo it's not really   but they do have bears betty and nils  '   ya ya ya ya ya  well that's true   we had some  i'm just looking at your mug   ya but we didn't have them like close to our house the bears  well ya keith and naomi   there were this well this uh this spring  anyway this fall rather there was  there was a bear on the loop   no  n ya  ya keith was out on his canoe  oh i just think he's an urban slicker and freaked out  it's probably a rock or something  i think he's i don't think they're very   no no no no   remember when they first moved in you said they were   outdoorsy   they do run a they do  they run outboard bound programs   keith is very in shape   uh  they do they do and uh uh   well then how come they're so freaked out about skidding on the road and they don't and they like   putting your backs up against getting winter tires  i mean they seem so urban  well they are they've lived in toronto all their lives  i mean they've live in toronto but they you know do a lot of outdoorsy things anyway   three or four words very   i know but people don't justhave like that kind of   equipment for looks  it's because it's like that hard and it's that tough and it's that slippery you know what i mean  and it's like they didn't really seem to wanna   want to get winter tires right   oh no they they  ended up getting them  but by the same token i mean when they when they go on their trips they basically go to some place park the car at some lodge and take off on foot  it's not like they're driving any place you know  like they're they're really on-foot excursions   so uhm but uh it's a same it's the same  as me  i've never had winter tires on my car before i moved up here   y'know you know   i have a four wheel drive and uh it was fine  even last even last winter with uh  the regular tires the regular all season tires it would go up the hill fine  but for some reason there was a problem this year  they're not freaked out by it  they're concerned by it and obviously there's
