 stuff like that i grew up with like looking at in you know  i don't know if you were reading the newspaper or going to like uhh a repertory cinema or something like that  mm hmm  i got those feelings like in a sense i am trying to date it more but i can understand what you mean in the sense of why is this object in you know like the memory  well maybe it could should be combined with another other images beside it  like let's say uh you have the sources that come from uh  perhaps if you juxtapose things that come from different sources that might be interesting  so that it's not only this memory of the cinematic images of those posters  mm hmm  but what other kind of things was were   going on then  what was happening in politics  mm hmm  uhh you know what was happening in your personal life  like i think maybe that the memory could be elaborated   to include other things and have a series of things one beside the other so they kind of form a more complex kind of vision  oh i see what you mean yeah   you know like i think of uhh like something   did you lose the w   like i'm just running through ideas now that you just  provoked it  yeah phone rings   scuse excuse me speaker a is on the phone for about 1 minute   hello  yeah so i was just thinking you're talking about juxtapositioning i could add more memories into the drawing i'm thinking  but would you lose the focus of the main issue if i added like you know uh water pistols and you know all kinds of stuff that i can remember of the seventies growing up and stuff like that  with you know this too or whatever i'm thinking would i lose stuff or would i gain things from that  well i'm just thinking of   would it be more juicier in conent in a sense if you looked at something like i dunno don't know maybe just looking at a lotta lot of nostalgia and memories  well i would start by thinking of just other objects but i was thinking like what else was going on in the seventies besides those posters  like there were you know there could be  other sources  there could be uh newspaper articles uhm there could be uh you know personal photography references  so there could be you know pri the private realm and the public realm  the realm of media uh you know there could be copies of drawings that you did  mm hmm   i mean there could be layers maybe it's not in this particular image all stuck into the same thing but you know you could have a row of them or a serial thing  yeah well that's in a sense what i'm doing   with the with the objects themselves ah  like you know i   i'd like to like i haven't put   them all like both the the  posters up yet in a sense but   mm hmm  i dunno don't know if they're   gonna going to work as a series of objects or whatever  like if i do the mountain the owl the ebony carving and uh i dunno don't know one more  i was thinking of the the dinosaur the one that my brother dr my brother carved  or whatever  i was thinking those four objects together like i think the dinosaur's gonna be one that has a lot of   but you see those i think are all still sort of a nostalgia image that comes from the movies you know around uh fantasy animals and  mm hmm  you know fantasy images that are from science fiction and things like that   but that something that was a large part of my childhood though fantasy  right  i you know i grew up just  making up games in your head and stuff like that  i wasn't nintendo boy at all you know  mm hmm  and that's something i find different in the age today where all these kids are just you know video games video games t v t v t v  you know   mm hmm   i was quite the t v fanatic and buff but we also had you know a free run of you know fields and you know playing with plastic dinosaurs and creating games and stuffed animals and creating games and characters and you know all kinds of  we were very animated children as w you know the street  so are you saying because they weren't on the screen like somehow there's more of a human kind of personal  oh yeah definitely it's very   i mean like you're imagining a time that was sort of kinder or softer  is that one of these things that you're trying to get across  yeah i think so  i think i'm just trying to capture you know uh uhhh a lot of for me i get a lot of nostalgia feeling from it like i just you know sit back and look at it and i can remember you know being yay big you know looking at stuff like this and going oh my god you know like  i remember seeing alfred hitchcock's uh the birds or whatever for the first time and that just terrified me and now i look at it and go like ohhh you know like breath   but back then it was something like i would have nightmares  on days on end just like oh my god they're coming to get me  i think that's something i'm trying to evoke in this too just  the the kitschiness of you know being scared and you know the boogeyman and  you know stuff like that and i think the owl had like that feeling too  being a centrepiece in the living room you know like  it was always there and it was always sort of like you know oooh you know spooky and scary-looking and stuff like that  uh huh   breath in a sense that's what i'm trying to accomplish i think more in the objects  but i can see in a sense what you're saying with you know how do you the viewer get that and i don't know if i'm coming across that well in conveying these messages you know like  well that's why i was sort of thinking that if they were you know like in this kind of format here you know where you have   maybe utterance   you know in this image by larry rivers you know you have these fragments of things so it appears like more like stream of co    mm hmm   like formally he's created a space and a composition that is something like stream of consciousness or could easily apply  to memory as well  loud cough   like i'm just thinking first of all the mark  the mark you're suggesting is very permanent  i could see that maybe   like each object is defined you know in a very permanent looking kind of way  mm hmm   it it should be a little more fragmented do you think  well i think that perhaps if you handled it  i'm not   i dunno don't know   exactly how to do it   yeah   i can see what you're getting at word    but if i you know think about that like just uhh as i was saying before about memory  yeah  uhm swallows you know that memory   it's different  is always a little   the image you have of something in your mind even though it's very clear uh is different than when you're actually going through it in the moment  so there's formally i would say that you could explore things that noise in background uh evoke that aspect  and that's why i was showing you that image because it formally suggests a composition that could evoke it   i think uhm i think i could get   you know   yeah i think what i'm missing maybe a little more in these drawings is maybe writing like blurbs of memory   or if i look at the writing here like  one of it's an artwork so what distinguishes uhm you know writing for information and writing that's for art  mm  you know like how would you make a distinction   you know like in here the writing becomes a formal part of the composition it has the the kind of sort of uh you know change and variation and nuance that the painter and the marks have  like there are you know some of them are wiped out and s   yeah no i can see   you know there's a certain   there is definitely the relation  yeah there's a relationship between all the marks and the handwriting  the colour   so these are things to consider uhm that might be employed in the piece  and again in the one of the cheese like there was a liveliness to the marks you know they they had more of some of these qualities you know  they they seem to have some of your  handwriting along with the handwriting like  yeah okay  and you know made them kind of more interesting  mm hmm  so uhm or even something like this you know where you've got the handwriting  there's something you know a bit brutal about the way this is handled so that it becomes more than sort of copying the look of a particular poster  right  you know because it's not enough like in an artwork like  we ex you know like we would demand  more  you think i'm being a little too formal maybe  i would say   maybe i should   it's not that you're being too formal i think the content like i would want a little more sense of irony in it of some critical edge  like i don't find i'm getting enough of a challenge   from it intellectually or enough of an edge in the statement   yeah   and i'm wondering how to problematize it you know so that there's more of of </} content that comes through  and i could show you some things   do you know marlene dumas' work  no humming pause for about twenty seconds  you know so if i take an image like this which comes from a polaroid photograph that has been you know painted and you know not in similar colours to the ones you're using  but there's uhm you know a kind of exploration of things that are tight things that are looser you know just getting into the play of  the materials more and no it's not   just a reco repeating of the polaroid photograph but bringing it into sort of orginal artwork  word   i saw it's ralph steadman laugh  drawing a bit of himself a self portrait  oh yeah  off a polaroid half the face is just going crazy and half the face is sketched out half his face and half of it is a photograph but yeah the colours just change the whole thing  oh yeah   very quiet muttering starts i'm just trying to find some of the text in them i had some slides with text   very quiet muttering ends   oh yeah like here you know it says pregnant you know nineteen eighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine uhm  what'd she write on the thing there  yeah she writes you know uhh it's called the cover-up you know so the title is ironic you know cos we can't think of the word cover-up without thinking of nixon and  yeah  it's more it has like a lay an intellectual content   i guess what i'm feeling is that i would like to see more of an intellectual content in that  laugh   okay  you know and formally i find that you know things uh being so much the same treatment everywhere you know i don't find it as formally interesting as the one with the cheese in that in that sense  mkay okay   you know like all the libraries that'd be wearing this  material would be all  like they're not exactly slick and they're not exactly awkward or expressionistic they're sort of somewhere in between  mm hmm  and they sort of hover  i don't know like their intention is a little uh unclear to me  mm hmm  you know we talked about that you know the handwriting maybe you should get more like graffiti maybe it should be slicker maybe some of it should be like graffiti and some of it should be airbrushed some of it should be stencilled or you know like maybe you should do one that's just a composition with just the letters and see what kind of composition you can work out with just the words  you know a composition using words and dealing with spaces in between the letters and seeing what you could do with that
