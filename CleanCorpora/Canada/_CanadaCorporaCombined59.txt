 how's life laugh   well so far actually pretty good  ya   you know i've been keeping busy  how are your courses going   not too bad actually   cos you're taking that learning disabilities   right   yes ya  and i'm i quite like it actually  ya you think it's gonna  going to be okay  so far  well so far it's been uh pretty easy  well the first week we missed the class  ya   because the class was on tuesday and the school didn't start till wednesday  uh huh   remember   mhh hmm   well we had no class that week  ya ya ya   then the next week uhm we had a class the next two weeks  uh huh   and last tuesday i had no school because it was a jewish holiday so the teacher didn't come  right right   and tonight i have a class but it's a jewish holiday also  mhh hmm   but so he's not going to be there but he is sending a replacement  you're kidding  wow   so it's good  there's no term paper  gee  gonna going to be  two word two tests   just two tests and that's it   fifty percent mid-term  fifty percent wh   which i i i like that  you know   that's not too bad   i don't mind   you just do the reading   you go to the classes  you learn the material   it's easier   ya   i mean even though everybody at the bissel  centre's gonna going to hear me say this   but uh   ya ya   no i agree because sometimes you get so overloaded with projects  ya and if you've  i it's just   like right now i've got all of these group projects and it's so hard to get people together and you don't know the people that well and you get thrown into these groups and you're just running all around like a  mad person   that's right   sometimes you wonder what you're learning  ya exactly   you know are you really learning more  if you do all those things  then then not  right   mhh hmm   ya   so sometimes i thi   think i really think it's true  it's too much  right   it's almost like busy-work  well that's it  that's it  you know and once it becomes  there's a fine line between busy-work and  learning   ya   and crazy - work  ya right  and learning something   you know when you're just going nuts   ya  and there's a real reason for it  anyways so i like that   ya ya good   and the other course i'm taking is an adult   which one's that aga  again   a adult ed   adult ed   mhh  we have a paper for that one  okay  so i  but not due yet  ahh   and a presentation  oh ya  so we can do it in a group  we're doing it in a group of three   a group presentation  okay   which i for me i  prefer it because there just seems  to   mhh hmm   ya   well i found that group presentations aren't too  bad  if you don't have to do a write-up to go with it  word i've never done a presentation    i've never done a presentation   cos if you do a write-up it's it's  really hard you  know to like get everybody to do an equal amount  of work   then's it's a word   right   that's true   and then you know you have to you know group edit it  you're right   you have to do uh make all these meetings and ya  no absolutely   so that's not too bad   but i've never done a presentation   would you believe it  oh come on  really  you do them every well the other  day when you're teaching   ya i know   no that's right   but   i know that's why they send you to   but not formally   but not really  i'm not sure how to you know go about doing it  or what i'm  supposed to do  do it   ya   you know they just say do a presentation and  and never say on what   ya   ya i'm sure you'll do fine   because three words with teaching experience   words what i'll find   i'm not worried about doing it it's just what i should do it on you know  no   no i know   on what  but the people with teaching experience are more natural  when they do it  because people who don't have this experience  of getting up and speaking in front of  people what they do is they read their presentation  yes   i know   oh really  they have it on little cards and they read it   ahh   and it's it's not that good  uhm well not only for your mark but also it doesn't flow and   it it's hard to listen to as a listener in the audience  you know if it's being read to you   mhh hmm   mhh  or even if it's memorized too  much or   right   oh boy it's hard to memorize a  presentation that's a half an hour  long   you know it's it's hard to follow   well exactly exactly  so but mind you you  well i suppose you're right  i think you have to memorize like certain parts but   not word for word   because when you're teaching it's not the   it's not the same because i  i don't you know  it's much more natural  no   mhh   well that's it   but anyway i'll   that's what i have to do  ya   so <-i've it's real really  i haven't been bogged down with projects and  things yet  and i'm quite happy  ya   i'll tell you the truth   good   we've been going to the country every weekend  ohh wonderful   the leaves are beautiful   oh i bet  so i feel like i have a life  ohh great   laugh words    ya that's what i'm looking forward to after this year is getting a life back again laugh   you'll be finished after this year   well i should be finished in april   if everything goes well   ohh   because i've got my two practicums and then uhm  i've just got two other courses   you words after christmas   no i'm doing one now  are you  now   ya   are you in a process of doing it now  ya   ya ya ya   you're actually doing it  well no no  uh well actually i'm teaching the tyndale students now  beginners' class  and this is to prepare us for going into the primary school  for teaching beginners  like children huh  okay  but we get the adults now because they're so much easier to teach than little kids  ya   ya  and uhm so we're practising with them  and uh i'm   how are you feeling  how are you finding   well it's interesting  again we're doing group teaching  so this has been kind of difficult   okay group teaching meaning you do some and then they do some or toge together you do it  you can't teach together  we do a little bit  uhm you know the there is like one person in charge of each part more or less  ya   but then uh we get like the other people in our groups uh to interact with the students in like the group work or the pair work and that's what it  word   mhh hmm   right but generally how you do it usually is one gives a presentation perhaps and one might do  no  you word   uhhm   you can't both give the presentation   well for example you  you introduce   something and then maybe i'll get one of the stu student like one of the student teachers to come and do the dialogue  with me for example   the introduction to the lesson no   right   okay okay right   and then maybe i'll take half the class and  you know get them to follow me and then the other class will follow the other person  for example   right   it has its good points and its bad points i guess  you think   well ya   the thing is we got put into groups with people that we hardly knew  okay  so that it takes a little while till you get used to the other person's personality and and what we found was we were haggling over a bunch of insignificant  details   right   right right  you know trying to decide you know the exact word that you want to put in you know at every little model sentence that you're going to give  and and you know it it  can take like ten twenty minutes sometimes  one person wants to say it this way and the other person want to say it this way  like somebody wants to say how are you and somebody else wants to say how are you doing   and then this gets argued about for you know fifteen or twenty minutes   right  that's and you think a it's waste   of time   it's ridiculous you know  ya   that is  it is  so these are the kinds of things that   how often do you have to go  uhm well i've done uh two sessions  and i've got two more to do  so i'm in a group of four people and we have to divide up eighty-five minutes between the four of us  and we also have to follow this kind of pattern they have  probably you've heard about this  the pre-activities the while-activities and the post-activities  ya  and then we've hardly had any time like to meet and  organize this  stuff   okay   ya ya   so what i'm finding is with our group is  that one person does something for twenty minutes and then the next person does something and it doesn't fit at all with the thing that came  before it   right right right   you know there's no continuity  so it seems like we're we're giving   all lessons all over the place   is it happening in every group   or do you get to observe any other groups do it   well the thing is we were the first group so i think we were a little bit you know  uh penalized in a way   right   what is who's your teacher    we didn't have time to prepare   who's uh who's the teacher    uh his name is charles batard   he's a principal of an elementary school that does these intensive english courses   oh okay   or actually in intensive   e english programs  you know these kids that go for six months or something and they do only english   mhh hmm   and uh he has his own little school in st st  eustache  and that's wh where   actually where i'm hoping to do my practicum because i've heard that it's supposed to be really an excellent excellent school   mhh really  that particular school  ya  and the c t's are supposed to be very very uh  not only very very nice but also very very helpful and knowledgeable and they have lots of resources  and i know somebody who did the practicum there last year  and she was   can you ask to go there  i did already and i'm waiting to find out now  if if it will happen  phrase have hmm   because you know they have to look at everybody's situation where everybody lives and you know divide people out  so i'm hoping that i'll go there  it's far  it's far i don don't   i know but i don't mind if i get a good   three words right   i don't blame you  if i get a good spot i i don't care if it takes me two hours to get there  mhh hmm   i'll do it   and then when do you start uh to go  that'll be in november  the whole month of november   ya okay   every day  mhh hmm  ya  so uhm ya that's what i'm looking forward to that   i'm really looking forward to it because i think uh of   if especially if i get that position or something comparable  you'll be doing primary  is that right   primary ya   mhh hmm   i think it'll be a really good t   training program   oh ya   i think you learn  there's no question you learn more from that than you learn from all the you know courses you take on early english history of language and  sounds and phonetics and  right   laugh ya   you know it's good to know but  well exactly  ya  you certainly learn by doing  oh that's for sure  and what i really want to do is learn techniques
