 so there's just a lot of empty tracks with no trains  on them all over town  mhh   mhh hmm   there's still some trains go through but not that many  and they don't have irving j.d. irving ltd. to buy it  ya ya  i don't know what they're going to do with everything but  mhh hmm  is that what irving's buying  all the the train tracks and everything  yup   as far as i know  and he uses them too   a lot of bucks there   there's a lot of uh freight that goes through  mhh   mhh   ya they should save the trains   he's a busy man   you drive through maine now to get to new brunswick and you see a lot of irving stations   so it's he is expanding   ya ya   he does he live somewhere or  so so he doesn't have to pay canadian taxes or   something   bermuda i think  ya something like that  but his three sons are still in st john  in fact my sister works in the office  oh ya  so uhm  so where did you grow up in uh  in a in a village of two thousand in the middle of the woods in new brunswick close to grand lake  it was a mining town  brick  there's a lot of clay there  and the woods  forest and irving  so most of the men worked at the mill and the railroad was a big deal  that's why my parents moved to this village  because of the railroad  but then my father uhm lost his sh   ya ya he was with the railroad right  yes he was an engineer and his father was an engineer but then they had to cut and so in nineteen sixty-two he lost his job as a engineer and started uhm greenhouse and flower shop business  oh ya ya  so that's what he did  uhm he bought land and started a nursery and  that's pretty enterprising  yes  huh  that's how we grew up  huh  and at first the flower shop was in the house and so there were leaves and ribbons all over  and lots of times when you ate there were  there was fern in it or whatever  laugh   laugh   no one really minded  huh  and then our house burnt uhm   one of the   yours too eh   mandy 's did too  mhh hmm   one of the boys forgot a lamp  he he used to read a lot and he had a bunk bed  and he had the lamp perched somehow on the bunk bed so he could read at night and no one would know that he was in there reading  but somehow the bulb uhm got onto the matress and smouldered and smouldered until it broke into a flame  and the house was badly burnt but we lived in it for three  y years for five years  until my father built a new house beside it  oh wow laugh   it was exciting   it was very nice for the children because uh  not for the parents because there was horse hair and   and uhm lath and plaster always falling from the ceiling  but for the children it was great because we could mark on the walls paint on the walls do whatever we wanted  laugh   do our homework on the walls  it was great  oh  ya  and then uhm we didn't move into the new house  my mother said we will not be moving into the new house until it's finished because your father will not finish it if we move in before  oh  but word   so that's why they didn't fix the old house eh  that's right  but one night uhm a rat or a mouse some creature ran across their bed and that did it  the next day we began moving into the new house  laugh   mhh  ya  d did so did they t tear the old house down afterwards   yes   are they still there in that same house that they built  uhm mhh it's a beautiful house  my brother bought it and he's living there with his family and my father built another house for himself  hmm  uh he just built that five years ago  and uhm it's got a lot of cedar  and once again he he is started uh his apple orchard and raspberries and potatoes strawberries and  great   he's thinning out the trees in the woods and  hmm   there are there's a  stream at the bottom of the hill and there are lots of wildlife  hmm   quite a few wolves laugh in fact  and uh he enjoys it out in the woods  and the children enjoy it when they go and visit  cos they get to  oh really   that must have been an interesting life word  there   it was interesting in that uhm we were allowed to be children for a great a long period of time  even in grade ten no one was really going out with each other  not until grade twelve did they start laugh   did you have to go away to school or was there a high school nearby  high school right there  five hundred in the high school  five hundred in the elementary about  what's the biggest city near there  fredericton  oh ya  i two words   i've never been   i've just sorta sort of been zooming through new brunswick to get somewhere else  i hadn't really i've never  spent very much time   this is what people do   my husband worked with uh research and developing in the tourists with tourism new brunswick and  well we stayed in shediac a couple of times  yes  ya it's really nice there   yes   pretty little town  where we'd stop and go to the fish market  pick up some lobsters and go back to the big lobster and  and eat it  mhh hmm   eat lobster under the shadow of the big lobster  mhh hmm   you know the guy that made that big lobster  i forget what his name is  no no  have you seen it the big lobster  no   it's this huge huge huge huge lobster  he made uh we have a huge huge elephant  in uh st thomas  because there was this this  elephant that died there  a hundred and  ten years ago  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   okay   barnum   ya the  was it  ya jumbo  from the ya from the  circus   ya ya   okay  and he was killed by a train in st thomas so they have   a rec erected this   this jumbo statue   the children have a poem in their nursery book about jumbo  oh ya   it was really funny because this statue came on two flatbed trucks all the way from new brunswick  so they you know took pictures of it and  like the the legs up to about the knees were on one and then the rest of the knees up were on another flatbed  and then they had to attach them together  mhh hmm  and uh he the he's dead now  the guy who made it before he did this his big claim to fame was making lawn statuary laugh and now he's made this big lobster in shediac  so has he gotten more contracts  well no he's dead laugh   oh   and uh jumbo is sort of falling apart  and uh he came down to fix it once and then he died  i don't know what happens now  mhh hmm  but it's a bi big   it's it's gigantic  it's absolutely gigantic  i think it's just ten percent bigger than the real jumbo  was   what what is it made out of  i think it's  i don't know like cement or something  it's it's really hard and ya  something like that  mhh hmm  some kind of  ah it's not plaster cos it's not it's not at all  you know you can't damage it that much   but it's it's quite impressive  they had a big fight about whether it should face   whether when you came into town you should see jumbo's head or his rear end   and uh it it was finally decided that jumbo should be facing st thomas  and and the whole city you wouldn't believe what a big deal it was  laugh   the city was completely divided  nobody was uh ambivalent about this  agreed   they they were either heads or tails about this laugh   it was like no we absolutely have to be facing the city  no we absolutely can't have his ass towards the incoming laugh  drive or traffic   mhh hmm   and uh what a thing like  for for one thing they were split on whether or not we should have a stupid statue anyway  and uh then you know then  when we when it was decided we were gonna  going to get it then then there was a big fight about which way his tail should be  so now the visitors get the laugh  incoming  ya   but anyway  only when you go out do you get to see the real  st thomas   laugh   so shediac and st thomas have something in common  mhh hmm  actually it was a big drawing card  i know when i worked in the post office a lot of people uh  from from the states and stuff would say oh we came to see  the the jum jumbo the statue of jumbo   mhh hmm  you mean you read the mail   laugh word right   hmm  you mean you read the mail in the   no they'd come into the post office and say where's jumbo  ohh   we came to see the big statue laugh   hooray   i thought maybe you were one of those post ma'am's pronounced 'marms' word   read each snippet  laugh   but i have my own little tour of st thomas  i there's lots of cool things there to see   uhm somebody about sixty years ago this engineer built his own house  and it's kinda kind of in a poorer part of town now  mhh hmm  but i don't know it was probably nice when he built it sixty years ago  that was probably in the what thirties  and uh he made all the bricks himself  he manufactured the bricks  mhh   and he had people bring him things to put in the bricks   yes   he had big piles of things as he's making the brick  mhh hmm   and in the edge of it he put uh clam shells  plastic toys bits of coal and lots and lots of pottery  like blue mountain pottery smashed up and the  pieces put in  mhh   mhh   mirrors uh watches uh scissors nail polish bottles  you name it it's in there  it's just fascinating  there's like ah dolls little dolls   and like teapot spouts  sticking out of the bricks  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh  laugh it's really interesting  now he   a great big two storey house with a great big double garage and every brick has got something in it  okay   oh that would be fascinating  it is  and just like the people who own it now are are  is the grandson of the guy who built it and he doesn't mind  okay   you know i'm always taking people over there to look at it   to look   in the sun it just glitters you know cos it's all  this stuff  mhh   so that's interesting   so did he uh bring his family up in that house  yes  and i think you know his son did and now his grand  grandsons is  i think that's how it went  and i happened to be doing municipal ennumeration or something  and i went around there and uh he was there  he didn't live there anymore but he told me that he how he built it and  everything so   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and it was actually word the guy  so you didn't know about it until then  ya ya i did  well ya i did  i always knew about it cos you know we walked by  everybody did   some people don't surprisingly enough  cos it's on a back street  and when i say oh you know when i tell them what the coolest things about st thomas are they uh   they don't know about it
