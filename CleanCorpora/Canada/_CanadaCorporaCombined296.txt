 and we were still talking there because a c b c canadian broadcasting corporation television crew was filming a documentary about me  my third novel the good places in canaan had just been published  and there in the window space veronica francesca julia ashton  one of the great teachers of my life whom i had certainly never forgotten showed me the official province of saskatchewan department of education daily register for recording the attendance of pupils which she had kept that year when she was seventeen years old when after six weeks of professional training in saskatoon she had come to treadwell on october the nineteenth nineteen forty-two as a certified student teacher with a salary of eight hundred dollars per year prorated of course because she started in at the end of october   and as i grew older i listened to sermons more closely i realized that all this magnificent talk about bible stories  the mennonite church i grew up in had only two art forms  one was great rhetoric and the other was harmonized singing    all of this varied preaching could only mean that there was some debate about what the bible meant and said in some places   and then my mother made a fatal error   to balance all the made up books i was obviously reading in school  she bought a book for me from a traveling salesman i think  now how and with what kind of vehicle this man it could not have been a woman got beyond all the gravel roads in saskatchewan there wasn't a mile of pavement in it at the time to this last dirt wagon track that ended once and for all at our bush place i don't know  if i ever write a story about him i expect it to sound something like flannery o'connor even though no one in our family has ever needed a wooden leg   there it was a very thick book one i did not have to carry back to school the seven hundred and fifty-seven hardcover pages of hulbert's story of the bible  the title page declared the complete bible story running from genesis to revelation told in the simple language of today for young and old   quote continues   a year ago in a used bookstore i found a salesman edition of this book  the agent is instructed you should try to sell the two dollar and fifty cent edition with gold and ink stamping plain edges whenever you can   quote continues   and i laugh i often wonder if you have to tell salesmen that i mean they must be pretty slow somewhere but  but my both my mother  bought the ink stamped only in blue cloth plain edges for a dollar fifty   first the continuous stories of the pictures and then that expanded into the tempting evocative condensious and nevertheless endlessly expansive stories of the words  i devoured that book for years  its very large size was very useful as well  for years my mother did not understand how fast i could read and when she called up the stairs for me to get down here and do something useful i could always shove whatever book i had under the bedclothes and yell back i'm reading the bible book and at least stop her lecture on two words junk  when look at that book now i realize that despite several years of biblical studies at colleges and universities much of my fundamental image of the hebrews in their strange desert world and of course i've never seen a desert remains based on hulbert and the pictures in hulbert  and so despite what i knew about the absolute truth of the bible an emotional conviction that i would never be able to unsettle from the depths of my as the hebrew scriptures have it my splochna  my most innermost bowels  nevertheless i read the bible stories pretty much as i read the greek myths in the tiny blue books out of the treadwell school library  schools that i've never yet been able to find anywhere either in libraries or in used book stores  books which offered the stories of jason of theseus of owl grey wise athena of medina with her dreadful tempting hair of odysseus scrabbling with pigs and one-eyed giants and the wrath of achilles and the stupefying beauty of helen of procrustes with his terribly strange bed that never fitted anyone of venus riding her shell up on the ocean's foam  i had never seen an ocean but the thunderstorm smashing the water on turtle poi point   turtle lake against indian point filled me with awe and dread  of fleeces with golden sheep and minotaurs and flying too close to the sun and falling falling smashing into the sea but incredibly lifted up poised on the noses on the snouts of dolphins  what were dolphins  and the slender woman running into the transformation of a delicate  branchy tree like the thousands of poplars or birch or willows or spruce or pine  uh it wouldn't be pine  they were too scraggily   but surrounded me at the farthest northern edge of the world to be transformed from a woman into a tree to preserve your virginity  what was that virginity   now the mother of jesus mother help me  but the mother of jesus in hulbert was mary the young woman  for the reverend jesse lymond no hint of sex could exist in the bible which requires some very fancy writing indeed   in all the one hundred and sixty-eight stories there is not a hint of the existence of the song of solomon for example  well perhaps the convenient excuse that a song cannot be a story  but then there's issac for example who in hulbert certainly has abram for a father and sarah for a mother but ishmael has only his mother hagar  as a child i did wonder what ishmael was doing in abram's tent all the time and perhaps he also was what popeye in the free press prairie farmer comics would have called an orphink   but laugh even for luther mary is jungfrau  that's the german technical word for it which was certainly never explained to me  so it remained for christmas hymn theology round yon virgin mother and child   in the original the holy pair is mentioned  there is no mention of the virgin mother   to finally inform me in the words of my sister whom i asked   never touched by a man   what's the matter with a man touching you  she laughed that's for me to know and you to find out  in the maddening superiority of every older sister that has ever existed  and so all i could do was yell at her you don't know anything either  but of course she knew  she did  for all that i knew she knew everything that i didn't which was certainly enough   to remind you of my writerly greeting liars ought to have good memories my friend do you have a good memory  or to touch the ambiguity lurking in sidney's phrase of plurals do you have good memories   god save us all from the present writing fad of miserable childhoods   give poet word activist robert bly half a blank page and ten minutes on t v and he will out-miserable both novelist patti reagan davis  her father and mother are much better known than she  and also t v star rosanne arnold whose parents now pray not to be known at all  genuine suffering is never a fad and never irrelevant   you have good memories regardless of whether they are happy ones because you are a good writer  and my memories are good too because in my child's world to be a storywriter was to be a liar  you concocted made up stories  when one writes fiction there is to put it simply and by our own admission no actual literal smellable and touchable reality to which the words you cluster onto the page respond  there is no literal brown cow hiding in the bushes   in my growing up world there was only one true book  the one book written by god himself long ago  or rather as i was told written by holy men always men only at god's dictation  men like go god's   like jesus' beloved disciple john who could explicate the entire universe in words of mostly one syllable  and this is a miracle   that which was from the beginning   that's two   three  biblical quote continues   as a writer i'm not for the moment interested in saint john's joy  i'm exorcised by his word by his writing the seeing hearing touching he seems to declare as so obviously so simply a part of the world's word   my childhood such a tapestry of hearing and speaking words in three languages and of seeing and reading and writing words in two of them gave me such an overwhelming gift of good memories that my good memory forces me to conclude with an affirmation it was that very interweaving of languages which made me a writer   there was never any doubt about when which language could or should be used but the necessary frictions between them destroyed the thoughtless complacency often demonstrated by monolingual people about what language may be or how it works   to try and explain to somehow translate or transliterate the possible vaporous ungraspable abstractions of literary or theological high german or english into the tightly circumscribed cryptic graspabilities of low german   that's all i ever spoke to my mother and father for example  drove me far into the wilderness of each language's particular genius  sometimes i couldn't find my way out  the languages didn't work none of them  a bit seemed clear in this language another bit in that or the other but never all in one   sometimes as i crashed hithering on my mother would say i know already i know what you mean and of course i was certain she didn't  how could she  i hadn't even said it   but then again perhaps she did   she died in nineteen fout forty  seventy-nine   and in my memory she is a mellow very gentle and wise woman who if you disagreed about something on which she had a strong conviction  and this happened often  she would sometimes say not always well that's enough talking now  i'll pray about it   and then i knew i might as well give up   she had in care incredible  cosmic connections   very likely they're even better now   the point for me is every writing reflects a literal reality  whether that reality is physically historically verifiable or not really does not matter   writing can and does create realities more truly experiential than mere facticity and therefore the distinction commonly made between a true story and a fiction or a myth beyond factual verifiability is literarily without useful meaning  reading for over half a century has convinced me that the best writing is often a more powerful experience of the actual world then the personal so-called firsthand actual experience sniff   we all know that  you all know that  you and i thousands of other readers have seen the prairie far beyond our individual limited perception because in as   for me in my house in thorasus lintus' eyes  no one who has ever read naomi woolf's the beauty myth can ever again consider the women displayed in contemporary advertising and see them in the same old way   you'll have to excuse me  i'm blurting out matters of serious import with unconscionable boldness   you and i have discussed this often and will again and again because the creation of formerly unsuspected realities with words is all our writing is about or all it needs to be about   and the way in which saint john in his letter deals with this matter confirms me   and i do appreciate a hebrew confirmation especially one with a boost from greek theoretical philosophy  the word of life at the beginning for me the overwhelmingly powerful hebrew creation story is the one where everything that is comes into existence when god said and it was   so look around you   god what a writer sniff   let me wander into another word world and tell you how the excremental world of sewers shaped my writer's imagination  i'll begin by offering you a relatively polite placement of  the story  it is called the opening toilet of edson alberta and it was commissioned by alberta culture  not the subject  just the story   and well you know uh alberta culture one must tread very lightly on both the sacred and the excremental  after this initial politeness we can get on to extrapolating implications which might be more fun   so here is the opening toilet of edson alberta   and and i have a point to this
