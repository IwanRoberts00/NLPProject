 so uh while tommy was actually attending a class or  s you know reading magazines at a friend's  somebody came over and walked into the house walked to the c d player unhooked it very carefully and methodically and left  laugh   nothing else was touched  nothing  and you know nothing  so uh so then when gary came back and found that it was stolen and was like fairly pissed and said to  tommy well you know you've you had a party and it's obviously some friend of yours well then tommy  blew a gasket and said how dare you accuse my friends of stealing you c d player and they had a major   doi laugh laugh    ah well come on tommy   get with the program   ya   so they had a major scene about that   uh it was quite amusing  well in in reality  nobody has any proof  but i mean   so did they did they report it to the police and stuff  i'm not sure what he did  i would imagine  but he's not going to claim it on his insurance because  two fifty deductible   and   well exactly  and let's look at it this way uh tom two or two of tommy 's bikes have been stolen and one of  gary 's or three of tommy 's bikes have been stolen and  one of gary 's and uhm you know it's like one it's just an endless  situation so  ya   ya   that happened to us  within six months we had two bikes and a   what did they take when bobo got out   that was the the v c r and a c d player  huh ohh ya   and that's when rex had to sleep over and take care of  barry laugh   and then jan the next night cos he was afraid  well it was his birthday   where were you  georgian bay  ohh  i was up at the cottage with   ohh right  ya  ohh that was so funny   ya that was two years before randy died  oh was it  cos i phoned home to say happy birthday and he said   we're there was a break-in and bobo  's gone though  laugh   that was good news   and the officer offered to look for the cat and barry  said no that's okay laugh   laugh   look for the v c r  yes  nobody cares about the cat  and then the cat came back  that was tragic  ya  have you ever heard about that cat  no and i ask the sister about it and she's well i  dunno don't know   i mean all you have to do is look to the left when you go to the car  but anyway   well  well he was nineteen when we had him  was he that old  he was ancient  ohh  and the goal was just to have him you know die fairly comfortably and stuff when we got him  so i'm i'm sure he's belly up somewhere  laugh   he was a kind of cute cat in a weird way  ya  i wanna want a dog  ya i think you guys should get a dog  i would like to get violet for christmas  i know it's tacky to get a pet for christmas but i   oh it is  it's horrendous  is it  ya don't  get one in the spring  get a b get a puppy from a spring litter   that way you've got all summer to housebreak them  ya  house training in the winter is a bitch  and what happens too is once you get the puppy   see i knew this on a rational level   ya i know   ya   but once you get the puppy going  like housebroken so that he's going outside when there's snow in the spring often you have to break them all over again  because they will only pee on snow and they're  cos they're afraid of the grass   that's right  i could remember rory standing like on a tripod to pee on  a a two-inch square piece of snow under the tree in the shade because  she had this entire garden to use and she had to use this teeny little s little bit of snow   laugh   laugh   oh that's really funny  ya it is very funny  but it's also so much easier to do it   i know i know  but we've just put it off all summer  i should have gotten one in the spring  ya  well anna and roger are thinking of getting   a a puppy  all the puppies from the the fall litter well the summer litter were sold  when they went to vermont uhm the people they were staying with had uhm eleven chocolate lab puppies  this is what i want  this is what carol has  ya  ya  i really want a chocolate lab  ya they're great looking and they're cute and they're fun and they're labs and they're word   ya   and so anna had one and they all had wacky names  like one puppy was called bertha and  but they were just names to disinguish them  ya  and there was one that anna really really liked and she wanted to take it home and and they just decided that you know four-fifty was they just didn't have four-fifty to buy a puppy right now and they weren't gonna  going to wait and  i see   so there's gonna going to   be another litter in the spring  and anna has all the information on it   and then the   oh ya and she and the ma uh  like the father uhm the sire   and and the and the the  bitch are there and so she knows their temperaments and what they're like  maybe two words stuff   ?  see i don't really want a pure-bred but   and where is this   oh this is in vermont and they're having a litter in  april i think  and maybe anna 's gonna going to  get one of those  ya one of those puppies ya   and what about the marriage thing  nothing new  marriage  ya   who anna and roger   anna and roger   ya  so far no  ya   no  i think you know the funny thing is marriage is way down on her list of priorities  oh i thought this was
