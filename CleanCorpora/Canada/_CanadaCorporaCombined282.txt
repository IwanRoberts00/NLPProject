 strong public support doesn't surprise elaine sahal of the alberta wilderness association  speech, 30 sec   in fact if there's one thing history demonstrates in alberta it's public support and provincial government resistance to the idea of protected areas  biff valance is an activist but he also did some of the original work to define alberta's ecosystems in the mid nineteen seventies  speech, 1 min 15 sec   that ecosystem protection plan was called foundations for action  it came together about the time the province was negotiating to hand over more than ninety thousand square kilometres of northern forest to daishowa and al pac forestry companies for their forest management agreements  the land allocations went ahead but the parks protection plan was shelved a double whammy for ecosystem protection  biff valance explains  speech, 1 min 30 sec   according to a leaked cabinet document at the time the new special places two thousand program was designed to allow livestock grazing oil and gas development recreation tourism and other developments  alberta's nineteen ninety-five state of the environment report confirms oil and gas exploration is occurring in twenty percent of natural areas thirty-six percent of ecological reserves and in seven provincial parks  there is livestock grazing in seven parks and logging in two others  there once was logging in wood buffalo national park until the canadian parks and wilderness society sued ottawa  today there is no logging in any national park in canada  minne alsace is one of twenty-five members of the volunteer special places two thousand coordinating committee  it was set up to recommend sites for protection under the program  alsace says the committee has recommended environment minister ty lund scrap existing parks legislation  speech, 40 sec   alsace says the issue of what protected  means is a critical one  her group the canadian parks and wilderness society believes that logging and industrial development are not appropriate in areas set up to protect ecosystems  i asked when the committee expects to get a response  speech, 30 sec   the committee is also attempting to deal with the thorny issue of interim protection for areas while they're under consideration  ten months after their first meeting the coordinating committee has recommended the kazan uplands north of lake athabasca and the athabasca plain area be protected as examples of the canadian shield natural region  these recommendations now go to a local volunteer committee for more input and discussion  a decision is expected by september  i asked minnie alsace if she thinks a protected areas system will be finished by nineteen ninety-eight as promised  speech, 30 sec   with only four or fewer of the twenty natural regions protected so far there's a long ways to go  most people seem to agree the primary purpose of the special places two thousand program is to protect examples of alberta's ecosystems but that purpose is muddied by the program's many other goals which include economic development tourism recreation and heritage appreciation  according to doctor jay allanson this means that if the program is to meet its protection goals it will have to protect much more than the minimum  speech, 35 sec   nevertheless the minister's promised to finish nominations by the end of nineteen ninety-seven and complete a system of protected areas by the end of ninety-eight  alice nivens is a former reeve in the county of strathcona and currently she's in charge of transalta utilities' composter project  she's been appointed the new chair of the special places coordinating committee  i asked her if the system will be completed on time  speech, 20 sec   despite its warts ty lund's special places two thousand program is rolling along and perhaps lost in the controversy is the fact that alberta's provincial parks system has doubled in size since the program was launched  next week we begin a series on the sustainability of water in alberta   most people know alberta is home to banff canada's first national park  but did you know alberta is also home to the largest national park in the western hemisphere   at forty-four thousand eight hundred square kilometres in size wood buffalo national park is sixteen times larger than all of alberta's provincial parks combined  alberta's largest provincial protected area is willmore wilderness park  created in nineteen fifty-nine this four thousand five hundred square kilometre wilderness is larger than all of alberta's other provincial parks wilderness areas natural areas and ecological reserves combined  since nineteen thirty-two alberta has created three wilderness areas sixty-seven provincial parks fourteen ecological reserves and one hundred forty-nine natural areas  alberta's largest provincial parks are the two newest upper elbow sheep and kakwa wildland provincial parks which were recently announced as part of the special places two thousand program  in alberta only wilderness areas and national parks are legally protected from industrial or commercial development  that's it for this

trends   if you think the sorry state of the world is making you sick you're probably right  according to the world health organization about one quarter of all disease and injury appears to be linked to environmental decline  the u n organization estimates pollution causes twenty-five percent of all cancers  also poor air quality and other environmental factors are the root cause of about sixty percent of acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia and the world health organization says indoor air pollution is responsible for ninety-three percent of the three million deaths each year which are related to some kind of air pollution  environmental degradation has a significant impact on the spread of infectious diseases such as malaria and illnesses that cause diarrhea  these claim almost six million lives annually  the world health organization blames economic development that ignores social development and environmental protection and says many of these diseases could be prevented through pollution abatement as well as improvements in water quality and housing  that's it for this week's ecofacts and trends  i'm tammy schroeder   on today's feature report we'll find
