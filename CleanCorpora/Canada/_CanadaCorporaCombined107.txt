 and when you come across it when you're dealing with that  you come across the problem of riel's limited understanding   you also come across the question of his sanity  mhh hmm  and the question of sanity is not an easy one because here again if you study it you are studying it as a twentieth century   what are you  protestant  catholic  i'm protestant  how devout are you   mhh i have no relationship to   under twentieth century  okay   ya   so if i tell you that god sends angels to talk to me  how are you going to react to that   i i'd be sceptical to   to say the least   to say the least   ya  i'd  if you came to my office and i sat here and said you know i was talking to god about you yesterday god sent this angel he said i want you to help this guy dan out you'd give me a real  fish look  laugh   mhh  now it's not  well that's that's no that you know that's not really all that crazy compared to you know people   a few words   that's not crazy at all  born-again christians talk like that  word they're hearing him all the time  you know/[2>  exactly   exactly   and if this were the fourteenth century and you're  two words class you're growing up in a different world  you believe in angels  you believe that god talks to people  so i say this and you say ya it makes sense you know  mhh   and and so one of your problems is that you yourself are studying riel in a kind of world that he didn't really live in  mhh hmm  uhm i'm not saying that angels did talk to him  i'm just saying that just how quickly you dismiss it depends on who you are   so that's the kind of a problem that you have to face  and what i've suggested is that you look at the books the first the most up-to-date scholarship and uh because   the up-to-date stuff some of it has most of it has included the earlier stuff so there's no point  reinventing the wheel  uh huh   i've also suggested you look at the poetry of  of louis riel because you don't really you know learn much of this guy  there's not much in the way of of his evidence and what he thought  we just have tangled bits conversations remembered by other people and it's it's very hard to piece   em them together  ya  i took down the diaries of louis riel there too so  hopefully that'll   ya   maybe i missed those but ya hopefully that'll   provided it's an a few words a reliable translation  oh i'm sorry  this telephone rings the  diary's by thomas flanagan  ya it's   hello  yes   uh huh   that'll be okay   laugh okay   yes that's okay  sure   okay   sorry   no it's okay telephone conversation   ehm some of the books just aren't very good  uhm louis david riel prophet of the new world by flanagan  flanagan is the most contentious one who argues the case of louis riel   uh george uh stanley i have down because he is the standard  his book now is uh over forty years old but it's still   the the basic one  $b> holds up   ya  uhm maggie higgins probably a reference to maggie siggins: canadian writer and journalist because it's it's   quite recent and  this is riel life of of uh revolution  thomas flanagan again uh and then the selected poetry of louis riel   and i did there's one book which is a book of readings by hartwell bowsfield   oh here we are  i include that because it's just a selection of a lot of stuff  now how many sources are you normally expected to consult for this  uh well it's twenty to twenty-five pages officially so  uhm i guess uh three per page  i've got quite a quite a you know  quite a lot of space to play with   well i don't look at it that way  laugh i i the only reason i    ya   i'm really asking this i guess because of other people  i mean i i think that people invent a magic number of sources that you're supposed to have  i i think you need to have what you need in order to do a workmanlike  job of whatever you're doing and what you need depends on what there is and how much there is   uh huh   ya   that's quite a bit  see you have to have a general impression of   not just of telephone rings riel but  oh jeez   hello   ya   still going   no   laugh okay telephone conversation   uh you you need a general impression of his world the attitudes of other people to put it in the context to see what what he's working in  and then you have to have a range of opinion of riel  uh i mean uh stanley's is is  essentially that riel was what he calls a near-great   that is a person who becomes famous a person who comes close to accomplishing something but is missing those real qualities that take you over the top  hmm  in short he sees him essentially as a second rate man  placed into a first rate situation  hmm  uhh i one two three four five six seven that gives you a pretty solid core to work on  i've stayed away from stuff which deals too much  like the execution of thomas scott  well   ya i don't i really don't think so   i think you'll come across that in other stuff  uhm unlike most people i don't have trouble with him executing thomas scott   ya he wa was he  sou sounds sounds  like he deserved it anyway  pardon   he richly deserved it and riel was trying to hang on to a very volatile situation  he was very young  he could have lost control of the m&eacute;tis at any time  uh i think that executing thomas scott obviously works against him in the long run but at the time i could see it  i don't think it's it's a foolish decision  uhm so if you work on those   actually do the ones i've checked off  kay okay   now what we're doing for this  you have to clarify me again  this is the preparation for the  this is the historiography ya  you're doing a course now  yes this is i'm doing ah three ninety-seven with geraldino   it's ah the honours seminar  ya   it's meant to to help prepare us for the writing the honours essay  and beside  well besides that we do we do some other things like uh an an analysis   an analysis of primary documents on the belcher island murders and readings and historiography  okay so you're concentrating on riel's goals or as close to as you can figure out to what on earth they must have been  yes   uhm   which as far as i can see he was trying to get a better deal for the m&eacute;tis within the canadian confederation   that's what he was doing in eighteen seventy   mhh hmm  i'm not sure that's what he was trying to do in eighteen eighty-five   and that's when you raise the whole question of his sanity when you look at  cos what he was what he was trying to do in eighteen seventy was clearly just to get a better deal   but in eighteen eighty-five he appears to have had a vision of what the west should be  hmm   that's not quite the same as just getting a deal out of canada   no it's not no  and in fact what he had in mind is something that would have required a very high degree of independence in the west  so uh ya okay   okay i'll i'll read that section more closely then  inhale ya  i think you have to make a distinction between  a and i'm guessing  ah maybe maybe i'm wrong and maybe we'll find out that there's a consistency in what he was looking for  and i i won't i don't want to prejudice that  uhh uh okay so you're gonna going to  your your job then for me is to produce a paper i presume on the bibliography  yes ju just   on uh on the sources here ah   and how long does this bibliography  is there a specified length  he   let's see   he says uh twenty to twenty-five pages  for the bibliography or the thesis  for the uh for the historiography  really  ya   i understand other profs have have  turned it down but it's it's up to you  okay here's   i i would   he said twenty to twenty-five  ya  here it is   okay i don't want to see more than twenty-five  uh twenty twenty uh and i would think that it should  here's what i'd like to see in it  first a quick outline of the events uh with a  suggestion of why it is that you're studying this  what is it you're looking for  okay   follow that by by giving a brief outline of the major differences in the way people perceive riel   how how how stanley has perceived him how flanagan et cetera  so you find out where the areas of controversy are   then one at a time you deal with each item in your bibliography  you summarize it and then you comment on it which  gives another raising criticisms about it  drawing attention to the strengths of it and raising questions about it  are there questions it leaves unanswered  are there areas that you would liked to have seen explored in each case  hmm   and do them one at a time that way   kay okay   uh and i think that should do it  okay well   and when shall i see this  uhm it's uh due on the twelfth  uh that's when uh geraldino uh wants to have it   but he said uhm as late as the uh uh third week of  of april is okay  so i guess if i have it by to you by   about the twelfth  okay   that'll give you a few days to mark it  about two words   about three words ya  ya  okay great  and then i'll uh i'll come by with ah a rough draft or something just ah to make sure i'm on the right track  i asked you before about your accent didn't i  ya i'm from vancouver  that's right okay   ya   is that just vancouver though   uhh i don't know  it's western canadian i guess   sounds a bit ottawa valley  really  ya  a little bit  oh well i've mh got a welsh and scottish background so maybe that's got something to do with it   well maybe more of the welsh than the scottish ya  is it that close the the background  uhm well let's see  my my grandmother on my mom's side was english and uh my my grandpa was   was welsh but on my my dad's side it's only my uhh actually my great cough  grandparents that were from the old world so not too close  ya   usually   have you spent have you spent  any time over on the west coast before or  no  what i've heard of the accent  course of course so many people don't come from there  it's ah pssh   ya it's a new  but i know the american west coast tends to be bland and fairly close to you know montreal english  ya  uh   ya it's funny i can't i can't tell much of a difference between californians and  and uh and british columbians  it's i mean there's actually a stronger accent in washington state than than in in than  farther south  ya  uh some things you say i would've sworn maritimes  mhh  when you had said british columbians and went up at the end i thought wow that's nova scotia laugh   laugh   uh that's interesting  okay  you've got a good ear for for  accents  well the greatest one i've ever had was i was   i was registering a girl and i said gee your accent has me puzzled because it's it's jewish but it's not montreal jewish and there's a touch of scandinavian  and she said well my father's from israel and my monther's from norway laugh   ahh   couldn't get much different eh   ya   okay  okay  so great  uhm ya i'll talk to you in about a week or so and let you how i'm doing  okay  i hope to get this thing on the road pretty fast  it's we don't have much time so
