sure it's a very nice place but i mean  there's only so much of interest for us see right  so we're gonna going to go to the louisbourg and they can   there's the park up there we wanna want to   go to louisbourg mabou   you wanna want to go to glace bay  or ingonish i don't know i wonder what yet  anyway i'll call this number i saw get the stuff  words or voc each of these places is one day trip right   seems we're out of word in three days  i don't know exactly   deep breath laugh   laugh   i can't believe we did that all in the one trip  we looked around cape breton and all around nova scotia  mm hmm  in one trip  three or four words laugh   halifax is   well you know we'll have to see  if we can manage word to  there's a lot to see in halifax[2.20ish? - - chk from here down]  oh right like what  well it's nice  i like word in halifax  wow well i i was so tired i didn't see anything other than word and a couple of restaurants  there is the citadel the word the  word   what  the citadel  mm hmm  the ? park and they have uh it's a park you know and they have uh a video that explained history of halifax  mm hmm mm hmm   ah there's uhm there's the old park down there down on the  wharf  mm hmm  some nice restaurants  it's a nice town to walk around  there's a botanica well it's not a botanical gardens but there's a gardens a public garden  okay what we   and then along that coast from uhm halifax it's really nice  chester that's really nice round the coast of chester  and the cove  peggy's cove  no peggy's cove you know tourist trap now but chester  some really nice villages  mm hmm   intake of breath umm   so it is nice to go there  we'll have to see if we have time   well what you you you don't like to do too much travelling  mm  you just you want basically  pack down plan it for two places and concentrate on those places  or  okay so what we do with two places is we can get in halifax  well cape breton's a big place  words you leave the cape breton  which is where the park is  mm hmm  and then you have to drive down to word   placename and i mean you don't go there just for half an hour i mean it it's far  mm hmm  it'll be far i think  so we'd stay at the top in the park in cape breton for a couple of days  then drive down to louisbourg stay another day maybe  mm hmm   mm hmm  there's this place baddeck which is sort of a tourist spot  nice  they told me that's where there's some word  graham bell museum  okay but  mm hmm  a week is a reasonably long time to spend in cape breton right  cape breton ?  oh yeah  words   i don't know  no i'd say five days to a week yeah  okay  a week there is nice you know[4.45]  so if we budget say three days to get from montreal  to cape breton  and we budget another two days okay maybe we'll say three days to get back from say halifax to montreal  three days to get back?  mm hmm  uhm hmm   and once uhm we keep on driving something in the line of eight hours a day   so uhm if we're going for two weeks two weeks is like uh   well it's it's sixteen days you just wanna want to   so we can we can we can we try it  mm hmm  sixteen days  mm hmm  so in travel time it's uh six days  mm hmm  and then  so you have ten days  that leaves ap approximately   ten days which you can get about five days in cape breton five days in halifax  i don't want five days in halifax   six days in cape breton five days in halifax  in that region we'd be   what  yeah words yeah  and that would be   word   okay in that region we'd be camping somewhere else  we're not gonna going to be staying at a hotel in halifax  no   very expensive   uhm it's a mic talking about tape microphone which has just been knocked   uhm mm   so we have to see words there's this festival in antigonish  the different word theme park plus  we'll be in pictou along the way  you know there's things to do and things   but we'll have to get  so that's sixteen days and so that would be the end of august then  end of july  end of july   so   that's when that's when   we wanna want to go   large loud intake of breath   that's pretty that's quite a big season you'll  wanna want to you know word make hotel reservations or everything   under breath oh god  even if words you can't  words words   words what the logistics are  i'm even prepared to go camping in the car words  park and sleep on the road  yeah yeah  yeah right okay  so we'll have to get the package anyway loud thumping noises for about 20 secs, starting during last utterance   well like i say we should we sho we should probably word nova scotia tourism or something annnnnnnnnnnnnnn and   and maybe even i dunno don't know maybe even decide to rent a cabin for one week somewhere i dunno   don't know   it would be nice to be in a cabin in the word  in cape breton  mm hmm  and probably the most practical thing  yeah   so  so let's stay in words   then maybe i dunno don't know maybe  words fredericton  in fredericton there's fredericton's a nice town and nice cemetary word which i've never been to  historical word i guess it is provincial park  i should ask margaret too we're sure about this region  slow loud breath   probably a national park  mm  i'm gonna going to get this stuff  i'll pull it this weekend  so we start the tour in n nova  scotia and then when we get there just pass through  okay  and what week would you be back  well i g y yeah  yeah yeah yeah  i mean you do one or the other y   you know  it's out of the way and it's hard and far enough eh  i can't believe i mean yeah people do drive these distances eh  mm hmm   you know people go you know two or three words and it's so complicated to get there and  no i'm not looking forward to this trip either  three or four words   you pers the driving  or  no  whoever's doing the driving can just   spending three days in the car  laugh   laugh   i mean you're going to the main route uh cape cod  it's like uh what six or seven hour drive max okay  and uh two words to be here  so you don't wanna want to fly  d'you do you wanna   want to fly   no i don't word   i i don't think we can afford to fly  well we'll have to rent a car  word   under breath kay okay   so that's july   august we get there  a day sanding in the kitchen  and then it's time to go back to work  and now it's time to start building the country house  laugh   uhm   so word if you're up to it  mm hmm  i discussed word   i was talking to words loud breath   so i am trying to get the price down okay  and the most you know words   no i don't laugh   two or three words   i offered them about seven thousand dollars so that the home  project becomes affordable  that's a price words to knock off okay  and so you know we keep asking them like you know   word we've lived in the house for a while words having the house for a while  where there's an unconditioned living room inside you know  so that's what it might come down to  basically i told him words   i mean we've got a toilet and stove  and it's you know   it's more than two words right  so sentence   words gibrock  laugh   laugh   for the walls  what  open wires live wires  laugh oh is that is that  what you thought was expensive okay  and sheeting gibrock is you know five bucks or something okay  and you know it's a lot of work okay  sentence   words trim and that kind of stuff  words instead of just plumbing  uh buckets paint  it would be heated  word okay the word  it would be heated  yeah   what else  i don't know exactly okay but i realise it's   laugh a lot of work words   laugh   three or four words and uh   words you just you you if you   word that stuff a friend there's this  there's this   basically there's two advantages okay one is that you don't have to pay for it up front   uh but in working with it since you're not paying for it you can be up front with somebody else  it means you're you're saving it for yourself so you can do it yourself  mm  over a longer period of time which is when you save money  okay   right   use your leisure time to finish off your house  mm   yeah  mm hmm  mm hmm  laugh well the thing is i mean you know yeah  i if you're just going to put it off for a year you know there's not huge savings in it if you  do that you know  you're gonna going to have to fork out  to get someone in sooner or later anyway  and uh the only real saving is that words  you don't have to borrow it word and then pay interest on it   okay   so what else did you say  that's it  sentence   it's a murphy's law yeah trying to knock the price down  cos words s'gonna it's going to be a major effort word   we're probably gonna going to have to put a lot of time into trying to trim a lot more of these word  he's talking about   you know he thought it was a price expensive himself okay  and uh he says that uh he's gonna going to  try to go back and negotiate with the with the toronto peo- uh office okay  he's their builder right   he's a registered builder okay  word   mm hmm mm hmm  he's he's got his own  word business  he's been constructing houses for twenty years or something like that  uhm back two years ago or three years ago or something he  got a contract to build one of their houses okay  he liked their houses he liked their product and uh he decided he'd like to become a distributor for them  mm  so uh you know actually he's not just specializing in building those houses he uh he's capable of building words and     whispers oh my god to the children? so  he he uhm he has to work with the prices that they give him now  mm hmm  and i realize the price's higher than the basic level recording file ends [ same tape as above, side 2; file ft2b]  we might as well take care of that first though  right  word before i uh  i was just thinking about what happened to me today i was tape is switched off then on again   yeah  uhm i pulled into the parking lot at uh allan doolan two   right  and uh this van comes swinging round the corner and the guy yells out at me do you speak english  and i said yeah and he says uhm oh good he says i  i'm a i'm a st- i'm a stereo  delivery man and uh the company just screwed up  i've got these speakers in the back of my car in back of my van and uh they cost like fifteen hundred dollars apiece   you wanna want to buy em   them   like i'm just i'm selling them you know  so he swings open in the back of the van you know and he's got speakers in there   laugh oh god laugh oh no   they're not stolen i mean uh  you know he's just getting this it's just getting  a bit too pat  protesting a little too much   no n no it was a little bit too uh  rehearsed schpiel on how great the speakers were  and how much and uh  mm hmm   right   then i couldn't get away from it you know i  cou   oh my god   it was obviously a   good thing you didn't have any money on you  laugh words laugh   i was tempted for about a minute  yeah  and then i realized that it was a scam  yeah  and they drive around and they get people and uh try to sell them the thing and they would probably   yeah they probably do too  yeah yeah  they probably sell them  so   most people don't you know a lot of people probably don't question too much where these great fourteen hundred dollar speakers came fromÿ
