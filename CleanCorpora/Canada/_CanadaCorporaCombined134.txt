 now more of the eliza green show on a m eight hundred c j a d  eleven oh eight the c j a d time  jenny billups will be in in a few minutes but we've tied  raymond lafleur to the chair after we let him out and had a smoke  laugh   raymond laugh is a journalist who writes for  le soleil and l'actualit&eacute; and he's the author of a new book on lucien bouchard called en attendant la suite uh waiting for what comes next as we look at lucien bouchard the man  and uh well no more words for me i'll let the callers who been waiting for ya you   hello miles   uh good morning   yes sir  question   no it  second question   okay uh the first question about europe i refer to are not that old  i refer to the europe that started to build in nineteen fifty-eight  and the europe i i am refering it's not the post-war eu europe it is the  the europe where heads of governments would develop what they call the reflexful co-operation  they all together make now  well first the foundation was with marshall aid americans  and i don't think americans help any money they are going to pull money into quebec if we seperate   mer   you know   okay but ah right anyway we disagree on that because to me europe was w they started to build it in nineteen fifty-eight with the treaty of rome  but i'd like to go back at your question though  you said mister romeno uh and others are true canadians  ya yes sir   i remind you sir that in nineteen seventy in nineteen seventy-nine nineteen eighty marc lalonde then minister of energy for pierre elliot trudeau doubted peter lougheed premier of alberta was a true canadian  i don't understand why you going so far back you going to nineteen seventy-nine we live we don't live in nineteen seventy-nine we live in nineteen eighty-three i mean nineteen ninety-six   well click on the phoneline   whoops  hello  hello  hello   you still there  ya i'm still here   good  continues point   mhm i know that  ya   yeah because you have been an independent professional for all your life  but that's a that's another issue   audible exhale breath   okay uh his point were the other premiers never tried to break up the country  lucien bouchard did does  which is true yes  but there was a view at the time and i want to go back at this when when there was a real conflict of interest between alberta there and saskatchewan to some extent  the oil and natural gas reached provinces uh parts of the country and and the the  rest of the country and then people were saying well you don't want to share you want to go your separate way  word   but but peter lougheed never threatened to take alberta out of confederation  yeah but eliza i would suggest that that  having not waiting anymore to share wealth with the rest of the country not only quebec but newfoundland as well and new brunswick if you don't want to share your wealth and this   that goes with ontario as well maybe uhh you got to beg the country more surely than bouchard is going to do  alberta is alberta's not going to give their oil free to eastern canada any more than quebec is going to give free their hydroelectric power  right right   it works both ways  so if you're going to talk that way about  one you have to talk that way about  the other   yes   ya   yes   but but at the same time you know  when when the opec the opec producers the arabs got uh they literally blackmailed the world uh because of the the war with israel et cetera   why we canadians we would have paid world price of our  word   that was the issue  then mister trudeau was great at explaining that being a canadian means sharing kay okay   uh so uhm ah in terms of economics i i  would say that some provinces are not very good canadians in  in the minds of uh jean chr&eacute;tein or pierre elliot trudeau  good morning pam   good morning  i'd like to speak to mister lafleur   he's right here go ahead   yes   mister lafleur i believe i heard you say earlier  that mister parizeau brought the separatist vote to forty-nine point five  or point four well yes   or point four alright   right   ya   yes   you said that  yes  well we now know that there has been some cheating involved  so de he didn't really bring it up to that point  that's what i'd like to tell you  thank you  but but at the same time madam the chief electoral officer said that uh the few thousand votes that had been cheated well uh it wouldn't cheat that much  let's say that it was more than forty-nine anyway  mavis good morning  good morning eliza and monsieur lafleur   monsieur lafleur i know you are very articulate  because i read you in french  good  so therefore would you please do me a favour the whole c j a d audience and the population of quebec in general to  define for me one word which will be i believe in my estimation give the answer to what does quebec nee need  uh uh what does quebec want if only he can define for me in french with the french meaning of  distinct the adjective  distinct as in  soci&eacute;t&eacute; distinct   well two things in one word what does quebec want i would say respect  oh and quebec doesn't have any respect  they don't feel look eliza  i'm i'm not the  spokesman for the whole quebec  oh they don't feel   i know   but but they don't feel happy  but your question is very important madame  in my opinion we should get rid of the distinct society  vocabulary  i agree with you one hundred percent because first of all it was a bad s translation of distinct   i suggested recently and maybe i leave you  your uh the people who listen to us with that    cough   in english quebec is homeland of the french culture in america and i think everybody would agree with that  and at the united nations homeland is always translated in french by patrie   like the palestinian uh uh they they say it's homeland of palestinians at the same time they say in french it's  patrie de palestiniens   so why is it that we don't say quebec is homeland of the french culture in america  i think it is acceptable   isn't that what the federal the federal liberals did a couple of weeks ago  well they tried with foyer principal and that  wha what the heck is the difference except they called it the fireplace but uh   my point is uh distinct society has become a symbol in quebec   yes   if you want to get rid of it you've got to find a better word  but but not different but better word  and patrie i suggest to you is much better word than because there is  patriotism et cetera uh than foyer principal  which as you know is leads to all sorts of jokes  but i agree with the fundamental question we should get rid of  distinct   but i'm not the prime minister of canada so uh you know i'm here to solve the problem but i not " i'm" here to give suggestions  and i'm puzzled by to know that presently  today when we talk there is still three premiers in english canada i won't give you the name still trying to push around to get distinct society to be accepted  i think they are wasting their time  they're ve very respectable person  it's very nice what they tried to do for quebec but i know it won't wash because uh it it has become and as by the symbol in english canada in that it is a good symbol in quebec in french quebec so  raymond thanks for coming in  thank you very much thank you   raymond lafleur is a journalist and the author of a new book called lucien bouchard en attendant la suite   it's available in paperback at your bookstore  eleven sixteen the c j a d time   eleven twenty the c j a d time  well let's shift gears and jenny billups is here  we'll have a nice relaxing chat about where to find things  jenny billups writes in the gazette  she's the author of smart shopping montreal  she's created quite a little industry all by herself  of of finding great discounts  and of course you can call ah and ask jenny where to find anything in particular that you're looking for  seven two nine one one three six   but one of the things we wanted to talk about was uhm stuff for camp  and being the mother of two boys i found out that there's  no point in buying almost no point in buying them jeans cos because they live in sweats  both of my kids live in sweatpants and sneakers  and uh the sweats if you buy cheap ones they fall apart so you have to buy new ones  and if you buy expensive ones which will last they end up out-growing them and the sweatpants last longer than the kid you know i mean  uh so what do you do  where do you find stuff for camp  well for camp do they they wear sweats in camp too is it really shorts and t-shirts   they wear they wear sweats and t-shirts and bathing suits and sneakers the laugh same thing they wear at home   uhm   except at home i make them wear clean ones  laugh   laugh   well it makes it easy for camp because you can send anything there you don't know what they're wearing  uhm there there are some obvious answers  uhm schreter's on the main is really known as a camp outfitting store because they get the lists from the camps and they know exactly what the camps need and desire and recommend actually to be fair  i buy stuff at schreter's for them uhm even for the school year  so   umhm   my kids don't have to wear uniforms and i go in and i get  raincoats and t-shirts and sweats and pants and it just makes  l life and underwear and socks it just makes life easier to buy it all at one shtore  store spliced shop and store   well you don't last for whatever fifty years in a city if you're not providing exactly things like that things that last thing  you're going to go in you're gonna going to get and the service there is terrific   yeah   they have someone helping you  uhm another new place we could mention if you're just going to pick up stuff for camp is winner's uh which is just just opened up uh a new one at d&eacute;carie square  oh that's true   is it d&eacute;carie square  is it d&eacute;carie square now   they changed their name back laugh   they have one at d&eacute;carie   they changed it back at d&eacute;carie square   and there's another one near sources right   right there's one out on the west island  and and winner's is a cousin of t j maxx  uhm it's kind of got the same perception which is we're  gonna going to buy up a whole lot of namebrand things  ends-of-lines clearances sometimes seconds and we're just  gonna going to give it to you for great prices but do it in volume  so it is it doesn't work as well as t j maxx if you shopped in both i think t j maxx might   t j maxx owns winner's or uh kind of  uh kind of you know it's kind of  there's some some connection there between the two  uh then there's also there's a place uh do you ever go to creations monie on beaumont  this is the in the back of a factory this is true outlet shopping uhm it's one thousand beaumont i believe i'd better look that up and uhm you go to the back of the building and up a flight of stairs and and the factory sends up there the sweats and and t-shirts and shorts and all those things you need for ah camp at great prices  and they even have a back room with old merchandise for really ridiculously cheap prices  so that's another great but but  their sizing there would be more or less from m you know maybe up to about twelve or fourteen
