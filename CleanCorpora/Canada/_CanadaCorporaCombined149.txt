 so over procedures it's a question of attitude  attitude from police officers from social workers from judges  uhh you know we've had bad examples over the uhh last couple of years were judges didn't think it was important  uhh so uhh it's a the community as a whole has to ah realize that this is a big issue  and we have to work on it  and yet we've just been through a week where four women found murdered  uh two of them apparently conjugal violence  the others perhaps conjugal violence  mhm   yeah but it should be enough to make people realize that there's a lot of violence in this society  and that you know every person in this society can make a difference by not accepting uhh the roots of violence  and and if you see kids uhh going through problems and solving these problem through violence it's your job as a parent as a teacher as as a neighbour uhh to get involved  uhh to make sure that in ten years from now uhh adults won't be solving problems with violence still  mister babineau thanks for joining this morning  my pleasure mister gore   that's jack babineau   he is of course the chief of police in the m u c  it is eight minutes now before eight   yeah  alright   there were standing   i think we had ahh for one day notice i'm really proud that the neighbourhood was able to hear about it  so so can you tell quickly just   what what happens next  well uhm i don't know  the people have been getting letters  the c l s c abbreviation for centres locaux de services communautaires there's over fif fifty   communities over fifty well over  community groups who represent thousands of people have come out against it  i mean people have to say our library our places where   we we're helped uh we help immigrants fit into our our society  we can't judge them on the number of books borrowed  and uhh maybe n d g needs double the budget than other neighbourhoods because we have a high concentration of new people arriving in canada  miss wa walkerton     sor sorry i'm   sor sorry   i   i think that   okay uhh i don't know  there's a protest next tuesday night i would say anybody who can come down to city hall on the twelfth and and at six o'clock at night and and we'll raise a ruckus  we'll be we'll we'll   uh uh you know maybe we can we we  submitted more than a thousand names on petitions  he's not listening  uh the the school in n d g  un autre sainte-catherine-de-sienne sent in a letter of protest with three hundred signatures yesterday from the children  miss walkerton   yup  i'm going to have to cut in there cos i'm running out of time  okay  but best of luck  well you know this administration isn't listening  they're really it's a done deal   i think that our library is cut this year because they have to save money somewhere so they can fund the superhighway  miss walkerton thanks for talking to us again  okay  bye bye  that's hannah walkerton with the friends of benny library  what do the scientists hope will happen later today  deep breath they're hoping that the spacecraft will survive  that it will make the plunge into jupiter  it's coming in like a comet  it has to endure intra incredible   temperatures  uh the heat of friction as it slows down incredible forces uh acting on it  then they're hoping that the parachute will open the instruments will work and we'll begin to get data  they're also hoping that the second part of the galileo spacecraft will put itself into orbit where it will remain for the next two years  and what are they hoping to find out  this is the first time that a spacecraft has ever touched  one of what are called one of what are called  the gas giant planets  jupiter is more like a star then a planet  it's made of hydrogen and helium  the same stuff as the sun  and because of that they are hoping they're able to see a piece of what the solar system used to look like  jupiter hasn't changed in over four billion years  it's still made of the same primordial material that the entire solar system including the earth was made of and because its so primative that in a way looking at jupiter is like looking back in time  so they're very excited about that   and it became apparent that if if  our soldiers were going to defend that position it would be totally untenable  they would not have been able to do it  so after some uh fairly stubborn resistance and some heated conversation and debate uh orders were issued by the commander that uh they were to leave with the uh croatian soldiers  so had they tried to stay i i think the tune would've been different uh but uh there was no point in the face of the overwhelming odds to uh to stay there uhm any longer so they were forced to leave  what uh you were saying the negotiations are well under way though to get them to rastovic?  yes it's not really negotiation it's simply a question uh  there're still uh a lot of croatian troops moving in the area obviously they wish to control the roads  so it's more a question of scheduling uh to get them through  under escort you just uh if you're owning the battlefield which the croatians do you just don't want uhm you know unknown groups of people travelling around in vehicles  is there a danger in going through that area?  not at this stage  uh the croatians very much control it uh they uh  they are in the bankovac uh town of bankovac which is about four kilometres from rastovic which was a serbian stronghold  uh we see now uh croatian civilians who had lived originally in the krajina in the houses in and around rastovic and around where the canadian soldiers are stationed returning now to uh reclaim their homes  they have paperwork that shows they were in fact their homes  and so we have a lot of movement of civilian populations in the area  we have a number of uh refugees that have come to uh the camp at rastovic uh for succour looking for uh uh water and food and that sort of thing and and a bit of protection from the   u united nations to make sure that uh they're well looked after  so there's there is always some confusion in a battlefield area uh immediately afterwards and that's what we're seeing right now  so our soldiers are patrolling the area trying to make sure that there are no uh live rounds lying around because there was a lot of artillery barrages and uh and that sort of thing  what's the situation you mentioned refugees are there many of them at this point? coming to your soldiers   uh there are not as many as we uh might have expected initially but uh we had i think at last count was nineteen   l that stayed last night near our camp in rastovic  but there's also as i mentioned a lot of croatian people who are coming back to reclaim their homes and move into the area  so there's still quite a bit of movement  there's a lot of uh military movement in the area  and so uh it's just uh as i say with respect to the forty-three it's simply a question of scheduling and making a mutually convenient time that they can use the roads  there are very very few roads in the area so uh traffic clogs them very quickly  i is there have we sort of turned a corner here now that the croatians have recaptured some of the territory?  um does this change the peacekeeping mission?  oh absolutely  uh it is no longer uh two sides with a a  clear demarcation line between the two of them  it is now the sovereign state of croatia  they are firmly in control uh certainly down in our area  uh and so i would suspect that uh the united nations authorities in consultation with croatian authorities will be coming up with some form of  an either a new mandate or a change to the current mandate or in fact even an end to the current mandate  and i think uh that is something that will   will be uh on the uh security council's table this morning  uh and i think very soon we will probably receive uh new direction as to exactly what to do  in the meantime there is a tremendous humanitarian mission that is available here  uh there are lots and lots of refugees moving about in the area  uh there are croatians migrating back in to take over their town  so there's a constant movement of civilians  and with that uh and of course war brings a lack of food a lack of water uh that type of thing so i think that   the humanitarian side is the the  biggest issue right now  you're trying to provide for them   thank you very much for speaking with us this morning  okay my pleasure  lieutenant commander ken watson of the canadian armed forces   the summer barbeque can be followed by a horror called  barbeque hamburger disease intestinal cramps and much worse  the bacterium that causes it is a particular type of e coli which is found in the intestines of animals and so it's not uncommon in store-bought meat  trouble is that ten percent of children who get hamburger disease  can go on to develop serious kidney disease  janelle irving is the national coordinator of a large study just completed by the canadian paediatric kidney disease research centre in ottawa and she's on the line now this morning  good morning  good morning jim   ah the research centre is planning to publish results from an extensive three year study it conducted involving hundreds of canadian children and uh they were diagnosed with so-called hamburger disease  how did these kids get the disease?  well jim there's there's  several ways that you can come into contact with hamburger disease although our nickname uhm being that it that would make one think it comes from eating undercooked hamburger minced meat   that is quite true although in addition person to person spread is really the number one ah risk factor involved with this infection  so it's food-borne?  yep that's exactly right  and that has the bacteria and usually if if  it's undercooked that's that's a tip-off right?  exactly if you uhm if if you think  about your uhm your your kitchens for   for a minute and preparing hamburgers for the barbeque at this time of year we can't see this bacteria in the ground beef   and of course most of us uhm myself included use our hands to prepare these hamburger patties  uh if the bacteria is there and if you are not really really uh conscious of washing your hands well with warm soapy water after you have handled the ground beef before you come into contact with your family members or before you go on to prepare the salad as the next part of your meal you really are risking spreading that bacteria within your kitchen  so this is uh a significant finding in the study that  that you can get it also through personal contact  right ?  exactly   it's a very important finding and it's one really that uhm you know when we first started working in this area uhm that really we were not as acutely aware of as we are now  we're not washing our hands enough are we?  we're not  now i read about an outbreak uh of the e coli in   in new england  people who'd been drinking apple cider from  from an  orchard can you get sick i guess you can get sick from cider?  mmm   yes   yes you can and this has actually been this is not the first outbreak to be reported linked to apple cider  the problem there uhm jim what happens is the  the apples that are selected if you like for fresh apple cider this is the road or farm stand apple cider that we're talking about  uh is not necessarily picked directly from the apples from the trees these are usually the ones that have fallen on the ground that in fact have been contaminated or mixed in with the animal faeces or animal waste   that is that is sort of in the ground  for example manure   ohhh
