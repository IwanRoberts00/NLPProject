 pullishy'll pick it up at the centre ice stripe   plays it back for goodkey  ahead to aaron zarowny and he'll clear it in across the line  bears will change em them up  they send esposito degner and cam sherben out   cleared down the ice into the alberta zone  krywko with it   krywko to esposito  three and a half minutes to play in period number two  three three tie bears and the pronghorns  in across the line  esposito whips a pass through the goalmouth  offside bears at the blue line though   cam sherben is gettin' getting   about his second or two good shifts killin'  killing a penalty  he gets a chance to play a regular-strength shift  they've moved terry degner to play with him and frank esposito for a bit  and uh here comes strand and uh probably jickling to even out that line merv haney  this line they started off the game big  they had a good shift last shift  that's probably why coach daum's got em them   right back out there  uh they really have dominated o like  we've seen em them dominate in the past  jickling will face off against dasewicz   and the horns win the faceoff  riehl with it  plays it over for wobick   bears knock it down  hjertaas played it into his own bench   three oh three left in the second and a three three tie here   bears had the best defence in the canada west this year a two point nine goals against average   lethbridge fifth best out of eighteen three ninety-three average  and on offense lethbridge second best offence  bears fifth best   fairly even i guess just opposite type teams heh  that's right   here comes strand with it for alberta  drops it off for jickling  jickling skates to centre   spins away from a couple of checks   his pass knocked down  here's a big hit by hjertaas as he hammered jason dasewicz   trevor sherben back to hjertaas  his long lead pass picked up by haney and he'll flip it to the lethbridge line   strand knocks that down  he feathered a pass over to haney   haney's in across the line trying to kick the puck free  it's in his skates on the left-wing boards in the lethbridge zone  they freeze it and get a whistle   the bears'll get a draw in the lethbridge end   pretty much what we expected evan two evenly-matched teams  they split the season series   we got two twenty-six left in the second period and three three  and in the last five minutes hasn't a lot hasn't     sorry  excuse me  a lot hasn't happened  and uh you know kinda kind of either way and not a lot of great chances for either team  and uh they're really starting to settle down and it's a tight game  bears   ya  bears have tightened right up here in the second i would say   pronghorns haven't had those good chances  the bears like they haven't the great chances either but uh they're playing more their style of game here  you're right  two two laugh two twenty-six   left in the second period  three three tie here at the clare drake   university of alberta golden bears and the lethbridge pronghorns deadlocked at three each  and kelln will send it down into the bears' zone  back to play it krywko   krywko skates it ahead to tiltgen   tiltgen takes a look  tiltgen was hooked off the puck at the last moment and the pronghorns force the turnover  now graham with it at centre  graham takes a look  tried the fancy behind-the-back pass  that didn't work  adair has it   over to krywko   back to adair and the bears clear it out   fired right back in though by knippel   penalty coming up   adair has the puck behind his own net  and there will be a spearing penalty looks like   not a not a smart play at all by dean tiltgen   and this will cost the bears a man   at least four minutes i believe   where'd this happen   neutral zone i wou would   right in front of us there  ya   dean tiltgen had a good rush up the ice and uh a couple of seconds ago   he looked like he was going to hit the blue line with great speed  he got hooked from behind  a little hook  nothing major but it could have been a call definitely  he went down and and he is frustrated the whole shift  and he came back and uh speared the guy right in the numbers and he's got four minutes  they didn't kick him out of the game  didn't think it was a pitchfork but it definitely   he turned his stick over  it was a spear  probably call it a stick infraction   generally what they call it if it's not a major   it's four minutes anyways  and this is key  this is huge  key four minutes for the pronghorns on the powerplay especially considering it's late in one period   it'll probably carry over to the early part of the third  one fifty-two left in the second  stands to reason that'd happen  the only way it wouldn't is if the pronghorns happen to take a  penalty themselves or score i guess a couple of goals   or twice   exactly  this is a laugh this is a  turning point of the game right here   aaron zarowny wins the faceoff  he's along the boards trying to fish it free to his teammate  the pronghorns have it though  back at the left point  harper over for kelln  he flips it toward the net  they score  dana rieder tips it in and it's a four three lethbridge lead   four minutes for spearing to tiltgen is what they called it   and the pronghorns make em them pay  and   coach ra ron kraft in your interview evan was ah was very high on dana rieder  he thought he might even be the m v p for this club other than jarret zukiwsky  and uh uhh made a nice play there  just drifts in front of the net   shot came from the point from number five travis  kelln  kelln   and nice deflection over top of masson's shoulder  ya they short that well  comes at eighteen eighteen   still on the powerplay   rieder from kelln and harper at eighteen eighteen and lethbridge back in front four three  and like you say they stay on the powerplay  they're now two for four on the powerplay  this is their fifth now   this is the second minor to tiltgen   and here is zukiwsky turning at his own blue line  he hasn't got wound up yet on this powerplay   he gets to the line  they move it in across  it's offside though as rieder jumped the gun on the right wing  so that goal by lethbridge a big one late in the second period  they're up four three  and the bears a good play on that rush by zukiwsky stood up on the blue line   made him dump the puck in  he refused to dump it in  they took his team offside  a minute twenty-one left in the second and uh uhh simpson zarowny and the the two d-men have to kill this off for the bears  aaron zarowny waved out of the faceoff area as was zukiwsky  as was rieder  pardon me  here's simpson facing off for alberta   simpson against gatto and lethbridge has the puck  they'll try to work it in across the line  they don't  here's a chance for the golden bears  simpson moving in on a break  simpson moving in toward the net  simpson can't get a shot away  he's hooked on the play by gatto  a penalty coming up   he wasn't in scott free with control of the puck  we won't see a penalty shot but that a timely penalty so far as alberta is concerned as it kills off the pronghorn powerplay  and once again these uh aaron zarowny and uh ken simpson have come up big for the bears  they've played ah an excellent hockey game the first forty minutes and uh the bears could not let another powerplay goal in there and they came up  they got a nice bounce off a blocked shot  and uh almost a breakaway for ken simpson but he did draw the penalty   even up we're going to go four on four the last minute and  minute seven seconds  and this'll be exciting hockey four on four   so gatto goes to the penalty box  two minutes for hooking i believe   and the faceoff will be deep in lethbridge territory stickhand side of cavilla   and like jeff mentioned four on four four skaters on four skaters as jickling prepares to face off  he wins the draw  now goodkey lets the shot go  that's blocked  and here's a two-on-two for lethbridge as zukiwsky gains the blue line  zukiwsky takes a look  falls on the play as he turned with the puck   and pullishy plays it over for goodkey   there's a hooking penalty to gatto   and here come the bears in across the line  this is goodkey  he lost it as he tried to drop it back   and it's cleared out by zukiwsky  down the ice it go   in across the line is riehl  riehl takes a look  in behind the net tried to centre   and goodkey with it behind the net  up for jickling  strand had his stick and his glove swept away   zukiwsky bumping with jickling  puts him in a headlock and there'll be a penalty against lethbridge for that   twenty seconds to go in the period  here's degner with it  degner takes a look   degner from his own line   degner skating to centre  ten seconds to go  degner will have to set it up quick  degner takes a look  centres out front  pass behind everybody   that'll do it for the period  five seconds left as trevor sherben lets the long shot go  it'll be whistled down but jarret zukiwsky with not a real clever play there as he was bumped   actually i think he was bumped by jickling but as he's skating off he put jickling in a headlock  and you talk about tiltgen maybe not taking a great   a great penalty there was not a clever one by mr zukiwsky  you're exactly right evan   and it was a good play by mike jickling  he took it  he took the headlock took the face rub and he just skated away  he wasn't even talking to zukiwsky  he knew that he drew the penalty   uh a good heads-up play by jickling character play  some shows uh some uh leadership for this team  and uh uh bears are gonna going to   have a powerplay in the early in the  third period to see if they can tie this game up  one second left in the second period so they'll do the ceremonial toss of the puck   penalties zukiwsky two minutes for holding or headlocking   degner got a ten minute misconduct as did riehl   two minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct each degner and riehl  pardon me  two minutes   all righty   that's better than a ten minute misconduct from a bears'  standpoint i would think  mhh hmm   definitely  don't want to have degner out for the first half of the  third period  they toss the puck in and that's it for the second period   so alberta in front four three through two periods of play  and i wouldn't want to be dean tiltgen going to the box going to the bench right now cos uh if rob daum doesn't say anything to him may maybe  that's his way but some coaches would uh lay right in to mr tiltgen right now  and uh i'm not sure how coach daum does it but uh i mean playoff time it's two out of three  there's no room for error  and uh you can't afford to be stickin'   sticking a guy in the numbers uh for a obvious spear   so again real quick on those penalties the nineteen fifty-nine mark degner and riehl two minutes each for unsportsmanlike conduct and then the original penalty to jarret zukiwsky two minutes for holding  the reason they gave uh degner and riehl penalties is cos they kind of milled about after the after the fact after the uh play was called and referee doesn't like that of course  wants to keep a handle on things  so after forty minutes of play four three alberta in front  of the  pardon me  lethbridge in front of the alberta golden bears  and uh eighteen seconds the start of the third period ah a big chance for the bears  they're gonna going to have thirty-five seconds of two-man advantage and ah ah a golden opportunity for them to tie this game up
