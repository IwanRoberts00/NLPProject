 sustainable development is about economic social and environmental sustainability  on the economic side the forest industry contributes six percent of alberta's provincial revenues  this ranks at third behind the oil and gas and agriculture sectors  according to economic development and tourism the four billion dollar forest industry is responsible for fifty-six thousand jobs in alberta  there are fifty alberta communities classified as forestry dependent  this means communities where forestry is the primary industry  according to the provincial government eighty-five percent of the annual allowable harvest of trees has been allocated to logging companies in alberta  in nineteen ninety-five more than seventy-five million tree seedlings were planted by government and industry in logged areas  but according to ecologist ron lowen this can be a mixed blessing  while logged trees are being replaced he says the forest is being simplified which may actually diminish long-term sustainability of both fibre and other forest resources show conclusion   as a young graduate of the forestry program at the university of alberta i was never shocked by the sight of logged forests but i recall how the battle over the carmanah valley in british columbia affected me  when the tension was at its highest i drove to the far side of vancouver island past clear-cut after clear-cut past the weary security of mcmillan bloedel to the end of the road  there was active logging going on and the company was escorting people through the ruckus of the logging area to the gate that the western canada wilderness committee had built that marked the beginning of a trail into the rainforest  it seemed as if all the racket and the dry heat of the open clear-cut vanished almost immediately as you dropped into this magnificent humid temperate rainforest of ancient cedar and sitka spruce  the soft songs of the winter wrens were all that could be heard  within minutes  even with my forestry education it was easy to question the wisdom  and sustainability of clear-cutting  in british columbia the free ride of the first harvest of old growth forests is nearly over  companies now have excess mill capacity and they're scrambling to buy logs from private lands in alberta  amidst the crisis the b c government is creating a forest practices code  it's an extensive set of very specific rules that industry will have to follow if they want to stay in business in british columbia  b c silviculturalist doctor gerald loblaw calls b c's forest practices code draconian  he says the code is motive enough for alberta's forest companies to improve their practices before alberta winds up in the same situation as b c  there's no question things are changing in b c and in alberta  but can things change soon enough to make a real ecological difference in the woods  doctor jill laster thinks so  she's an ecologist and a member of the steering committee that's just finished the second major draft of the alberta forest conservation strategy taped phone interview with guest speaker   scientists and foresters alike seem to have discovered mother nature  jim labrynth represents alberta-pacific forest industries limited or alpac as it's known  faced with controversy at home and abroad this multi-national forestry company isn't waiting for a new strategy  it's creating its own brand of ecosystem management in northern alberta taped phone interview with guest speaker   some critics grudgingly agree that alpac is onto something  the old approach would be to simply go out and mow everything down in a patchwork of twenty to sixty hectare clear-cuts  however old growth forest ecologist and author ron lowen  doesn't think clear-cuts can be used as a substitute for fire  taped phone interview with guest speaker   still alpac's jim labrynth insists their clear-cuts aren't really clear-cuts taped phone interview with guest speaker   in alberta the ground rules for logging allow maximum clear-cut sizes of sixty hectares for hardwoods like aspen and thirty-two hectares for soft wood like spruce  according to steven lark with alberta's lands and forests service the average is even lower taped phone interview with guest speaker   lark says alpac has had discussions with government about increasing their clear-cut sizes but no formal requests have been made as of yet  ron lowen says clear-cutting and the subsequent planting of trees is not sustainable forestry because it causes the loss of biological and genetic diversity  he says trees and forests are going to need diversity and adaptability to survive in a future world of air pollution and global climate change  but if companies or the province are truly taking inspiration from nature it could have significant implications for management techniques  i asked labrynth about how pesticides and herbicides fit into alpac's version of ecosystem management taped phone interview with guest speaker   it's hard to say how the new forest conservation strategy will affect forest management in alberta but we could know as early as this fall  next week alberta may be getting set to announce a new forestry mega project  we'll try to find out if the forest can support it end of show segment introduction to next show   do you know what alberta's provincial tree is  if you said aspen you'd receive top marks for knowing it's by far our most common tree  but alberta's provincial tree is actually the lodgepole pine  the stately lodgepole pine is found throughout alberta's foothills  mountains and even in places like cypress hills and peace river country  this beautiful species is often found growing in stands of trees all the same age  that's because forests of pine are often born of fire  the cones of lodgepole pine are sealed shut by a sticky resin that prevents them from opening until they're heated by fire or sun  this and many other facts about alberta trees are recorded in a booklet entitled trees of reknown published by the alberta forestry association  the tallest white spruce on record was a towering forty-five point six metres  it was found by logging crews in the hinton area  that's one hundred fifty feet tall or taller than most fire look-out towers in alberta and more than twice as tall as most other trees  the oldest tree on record is a limber pine along the north saskatchewan river  it's reported to be more than one thousand years old  this windswept limber pine is only eleven metres tall but it is so wide it would take five adults to encircle the tree with their arms  show conclusion   it was thanks to the alberta forest service that i received my first introduction to the boreal forest  when i was a student of forestry at the university of alberta i spent one summer working for the forest service as a timber cruiser  in a nutshell this means i drove or flew to some of the most remote reaches of our northern forests to count and measure trees  it was all part of alberta's phase three inventory of forests  what it meant was walking through hundreds of kilometres of remote virgin boreal forests  on the long and often hot days of summer we discovered many wildlife species such as nesting great grey owls black-backed woodpeckers  and bears plenty of bears  i'll never forget the experience  i'll also never forget what it's like to share lunch with millions upon millions of insects  whether it's the arctic grayling in the house river or a spotted sandpiper in a wet open clearing in an old growth forest mostly what i learned is the boreal forest is an amazingly diverse and beautiful place  what i didn't think much about was why i was measuring all these trees  at the time the government had only allocated about twenty-five percent of the forests it had earmarked for forestry operations  since then the alberta government has allocated most or some would say all of the remaining public forests  under a management scheme known as sustained yield management  the forest service allocates volumes of wood to private companies based on what they call annual allowable cut  the theory is if you cut the same amount of wood that grows in a given year it'll be sustainable over time  i asked steven lark of alberta's lands and forests service  how much of the annual allowable cut is left unallocated in alberta  taped phone interview with guest speaker   lark is quoting a recent government report called the status of alberta's timber supply and indeed the report says of the twenty-two point one million cubic metres of wood available for cutting  fifteen percent or more than three million cubic meners  metres is unallocated  but according to tina lavallee a forestry consultant and a former manager of public policy and planning at the lands and forests service this may not be the whole story taped phone interview with guest speaker   in fact according to forest service sources virtually all  of the so-called unallocated harvest is already committed to daishowa-marubeni international alberta newsprint and numerous other companies  we've learned from several sources that only about half of one percent of the coniferous and five percent of the deciduous annual allowable cut has not been committed  this means ninety-four point five percent of alberta's annual allowable cut has been committed to companies  the grande alberta paper company is currently negotiating with the alberta government for access to an estimated eight hundred thousand cubic metres of wood  i asked steven lark if their needs could be satisfied  out of the existing allowable cut taped phone interview with guest speaker   throughout our forestry series foresters have been telling us that the lands and forests service is moving from sustained yield management  to sustainable forest management  as lands and forests service policy advisor sam lamberthad  says the forest service may adopt sustainable forest management as early as this fall taped phone interview with guest speaker   this is ironic since the vast majority of alberta's public forests  have already been allocated or committed under the old sustained yield model  since nineteen eighty-nine the forest service has revised and reduced their provincial annual allowable cut figures at least twice  according to the timber supply report the annual allowable cut has been reduced by four point three million cubic metres or sixteen percent since nineteen eighty-nine  steven lark told us he doesn't believe the forest resource is over-allocated at this time and that he couldn't comment on whether the government intends to allocate one hundred percent of the annual allowable cut  this could be an important question since dramatic previous adjustments and un annual allowable cuts and the government's commitment to sustainable forest management and  unresolved land use issues such as the special places two thousand program could all affect the amount of timber available for harvesting  forestry consultant and former forest service planner tina lavallee taped phone interview with guest speaker   i also asked tina lavallee if bio and genetic diversity and sustainable forestry were considered in the government's annual allowable cut calculations  according to dan lawton the author of a report on biodiversity in the aspen forests there may not be enough room in some of the older forest management agreements to accommodate sustainable forest management  he says new techniques that would be needed to protect things like biodiversity could leave some areas squeezed for timber taped phone interview with guest speaker   doctor tom lech a professor of forestry at the university of alberta agrees  he says he doesn't believe sustainable development biodiversity or ecosystem management can be accommodated within current annual allowable cut levels  he warns some forest management agreements may have to reduce their harvest levels to accommodate the changes  steven lark of the forest service counters that other resources have been considered and that the government's approach is conservative taped phone interview with guest speaker   so can alberta support another forestry mega project  the answer isn't simple  lark says if grande alberta paper goes ahead part of the wood supply would come from the unallocated forest and the rest would come in the form of residual chips from existing sawmills  if grande alberta paper and the government come to a tentative agreement on a wood supply there is still the hurdle of the natural resources conservation board  and the n r c b has already indicated that for the first time ever forest harvesting would be examined in addition to mill site impacts  before any approval is given   foresters used to call aspen trees weeds  elk often gnaw on the bark of these trees when they're hungry  bears often mark the aspen's smooth white trunk with their massive claws leaving evidence of their presence for all to see  the trembling aspen is alberta's most common tree  with its striking white bark it should never be confused with its low-down moist-site-loving cousin the balsam poplar
