up the wall  it goes back into the corner now  behind the net  there's stephenson  they pass out front as morrison tried to set up his man  townsend behind the goal now as the dinosaurs all over  em them   but here come the bears  this is jickling playing out to centre ice   cleared back in  goodkey with it  cross-ice feed on the right wing  here's haney  merv haney steps across the calgary line  haney passing it on the right corner for jickling  his shot  glove save by dawkins  he knocked it down and morrison's there to pick it for the dinosaurs  he'll clear it down the ice  this should go as icing  back to play it is hal christiansen and an icing call charged  against calgary  back at the varsity gym it's forty-nine thirty-two alberta golden bears leading the victoria vikings in game one of their canada west semi-final   here in calgary the golden bears are trailing the calgary dinosaurs two nothing at the father david bauer arena  game two of their best-of-three  todd johnson opened the scoring at four thirteen of that first period on the powerplay from couldwell and krywulak a two-man advantage for calgary   that was the only scoring of the first   dinosaurs out shot the bears nine six in that opening frame  and then todd johnson his second of the playoffs it came unassisted at the fifty-four second mark even-strength here in the second  and that's how you get the two nothing lead  puck in the bears zone as ranger tries to clear it out  he can't   big hit by adair as he hit adam morrison  and the bears are going to be a man short here as adair in to lay the body on morrison tape cuts out   just wide  cavilla knocks his own net off its moorings  we get a break  coming up in our second intermission tonight stan friel  and the athletics spotlight which has become such a popular feature of our hockey broadcast  stan friel stops by with the athletics spotlight  again that's in our second intermission  take it stan-o in the second  the the bears  excuse me   the bears have uh taken the play to the pronghorns uh thirteen minutes into the second period   uh very limited chance for pronghorn in the second period  no uh out-numbered chances down low on the bears'  defencemen like in the first  and uh the bears have really straightened their game around in the second period  jickling wins the faceoff  trevor sherben with a blast and a pad save made by cavilla   looking for the puck is jickling but he was tied up by zukiwsky  and here comes o'rourke to the bear line   he can't get in with the puck  strand takes a hit along the wall  he falls on top of the puck and we get a break   i noticed jickling tying up zukiwsky  zukiwsky turned around took a swat at him   and he doesn't take much eh eh of abuse and he gives out a lot  no wonder he had so many penalty minutes  uh the bears uh in the playoffs like i said uh especially penalty killing powerplay faceoffs they are key  and uh in the whole game every coach takes stats on the faceoffs  and the bears are uh really kicking the pronghorns'   butt in the faceoff circle and that's huge cos especially near the end of the game in a three three hockey game this in the third period every faceoff you know is a legitimate scoring chance if you're in the offensive end   coach daum sends out two thirds of the law firm  jickling'll take the faceoff in place of aaron zarowny  zarowny colin back on the bench but they'll try and get the change-up as quick as they can   the horns win the faceoff though  comes back to the right point  here's woget wobick   tried to centre   takes the hit in the corner as pullishy nails him and takes him to the ice now   pullishy a bear out there literally  they freeze it in the corner for the whistle   good job by pullishy to take his man no holding  you know he gives him a shot backs up gives him another shot and uh nothing nothing illegal about it  uh they're talking to the ref right now but it's uh it's dave that's how they teach it  it was perfect  you do not keep your head down when glen pullishy is on the ice   and i think mr zukiwsky's learned that when colin zarowny  is out there he best laugh be looking around too  unless he doesn't mind gettin' getting  rocked  laugh some guys thrive on that   hey he probably doesn't mind too much  here's aaron zarowny behind his own net playing it up the wall  simpson trying to get it out  he does   and chasing it back in his own zone is knippel deep in his own zone  flips it ahead  that's knocked down by colin zarowny  however it rolls off his stick  and here goes zukiwsky  stick handling to the bear line they get it in across  it's offside though as dana rieder well ahead of the play  zukiwsky stood up well at the blue line by the bear defense and that forced that play to go offside  now he's having a talk with mark goodkey  you could jus just   you could put a spotlight on zukiwsky cos it  something's always happening  he's either got the puck he's getting hit he's slashing he's  hittin' hitting somebody   and uh you just watch him because something's always happening  he's chirpin' chirping or   sommin' something   why don't the oilers edmonton professional hockey team pick him up  not bad  big strong player  he is  lots of grit  mr sather one-time general manager of the oilers probably  not tuned in tonight but if there're any oiler scouts listening there's jarret zukiwsky  give him a shot   ken morrison scored forty goals in twenty-eight games a few years ago  and zuku zukiwsky scored thirty-seven the closest to match that mark this year  then there's a finder's fee too by the way if he ever suits up   colin zarowny gets it ahead to simpson   and it's knocked down by the lethbridge defence   and carpenter turns gets it out to centre  colin zarowny reaching for it  he'll hammer it right back in  it goes in behind the lethbridge net   spinning back there is wobick  clears it ahead  gatto is rocked by colin zarowny but managed to get it ahead  and here's carpenter   carpenter to the line  he's taken down taken out pardon me by pullishy   the bears clear it in  aaron zarowny in the left corner  bears in the midst of a line change so he doesn't have any help  and moving the puck out this is riehl  ahead to carpenter  sends it in across the line  masson knocks it down  sets it up there for christiansen  he was rocked in a hard hit by gatto   and now back to play it in his own zone is tiltgen  tiltgen tripped over christiansen's stick his own teammate   that caused a turnover  here's a chance for lethbridge  a backhand shot sails wide of the target  adair with it in the alberta corner trying to freeze it  he can't   now they centre out front  masson will knock it down as driving to the net was lance burns but masson's on top of it  four fifty-one left in the second  a three three tie alberta and lethbridge  this is sports radio c j s r f m eighty-eight point five  commercial, 30   canada west playoff hockey action here at the clare drake  three three tie  the golden bears and the pronghorns their first ever meeting in the playoffs   the bears able to clear the puck out of their own end  knippel will fire right back in  masson sets it up in behind his own net for hjertaas   and here goes strand with the puck  strand's lead pass just out of the reach of jickling and it ends up back in the lethbridge zone  now jickling knocks down an errant pass   sets it up for haney  haney centring out front  that's knocked down by graham and the horns will clear it out  here's burns now  he's stood up by trevor sherben  it's getting rough out there folks   and here's trevor sherben behind his own net  flips it ahead for jickling  he knocked it down  got it ahead to strand  nice move  two-on-one   strand with haney  strand moving in  strand moving in  shoots  save  cavilla he's got it   great play by paul strand  beat two guys in the neutral zone  two-on-one with haney and he made the right play  they took away the pass  he went to the net   showed great patents  patience excuse me  i thought he was going to bury it  uh good save by uh cavilla  and uh uh that's what they need uh  paul strand has been a little bit silent tonight for him and usually he he pretty much runs the show out there and uh uh he started it there  a beautiful play  a dougie gilmour type move as he raced in on a  two-on-one  the defender took the pass away so he went in on cavilla  and cavilla actually backed into his net quite deep but strand couldn't put it past him  right   faceoff to the glove side of the lethbridge netminder   and back to play it's o'rourke  o'rourke passing ahead to the line   rieder knocks it down  now zukiwsky over to harper  he's in across the line  harper takes a look  passes out front  it's off a skate  simpson flips it ahead  and here's pullishy racing down the left side  pullishy gets it ahead to colin zarowny  his pass is knocked down
