 so it was at that level   and in the  question   be able to take minutes in french at a meeting  uh to be able to read anything the administraion will throw at you  if you want to make ah a submission for a project you had to be able to write up your own project in french  i mean there are people around who sort of help you with things  but uh the person   uh and there were a couple of people who were certainly very competent very qualified would have made probably very good teachers who weren't hired because we felt they couldn't function in french   anything else question answer period with multiple extra-corpus speakers   uh the other interesting thing about evaluation if if   those of you who are interested in it  a new thing that's also coming is what's called une &eacute;preuve synth&egrave;se uhm comprehensive exam i guess is the best thing  uh it has never existed before  uh now it's brought in and again the date of when it must be applied has been pushed off a year or two  i think it's now nineteen ninety-seven  but when it is applied students who are enrolled in a program  at if they're in a general program at the end of the two years in addition to having passed having to pass  all the courses required there will be a comprehensive exam  based on something and if they don't pass that comprehensive but they've passed all their courses they still don't get their dip diploma   this is something very new   question   then presu presumably   the theory behind this is that they miss it so you so someone who has evaluated them will say well this is where you were weak so why don't you go and take another course in stats and then you will probably pass it next time or this is where you're weak take this this and that course uh extra courses i don't know  what read this read that  uh it's not very clear   uh so it it and what was even more interesting is that originally what we heard was it'd be based on the  formation specifique the real program courses but apparently no it's also to include formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale english philosophy french and phys ed  now how that's going to fit i have no idea   question   no  the &eacute;preuve synth&egrave;se because it's evaluation is going to be local  question   yup   uh already the re there's a team of two people in our cegep going around or thinking about this rather and they've come to see me once and sort of well you know this is what we're thinking about how how do we possibly do this idea of a comprehensive exam on the program and also throw in english french philosophy and phys ed  uhm anyhow  so that that's somewhere in the offing also   so if you talk to teachers across the cegep level you may find some that think this is great it's a it's a good time to rethink what we've been doing it's a wonderful challenge i can create new things  you may speak to other people who are looking for a pet  itself  uhm there are there are people who are very frustrated very angry in some cases  i'm sure everyone is very tired  uhm there are problems uh  it's a holiday of change  how do you how do you deal with change  do you see it as a positive force or is it oh change was there a change  i mean i had to do something different with my courses this year  uh and there are people who say change no change not me  uh so it's uh it's a very intersting challenge   and if you're interested in working in word  send in your c v laugh audience laughter     but if if you're into there are certainly jobs out there but it's really a matter of finding the right person in the cegep finding out what c what's going on  and what the procedure is and what the deadline is  okay  thank you very much applause, m c closes the session and draws attention to an upcoming event   it star registration starts   in the evening on wednesday  i think it's seven seven thirty  and then in the evening uh the person who is in charge of e s l at the cegep level in the ministry bruce wallace will be speaking and giving an update as to what's going on   uh the provincial coordinator for e s l at the cegep level is paul fournier who teaches at henri word uh in montreal will also give an update   uhh on thursday there are workshops in the morning  there are people coming i believe from university of ottawa uhh essentially on evaluation  one is reading how to re re  to do do re-evaluation   there's one on oral evaluation  i forget the third one  uh there is uh the registration fee is something like fifty dollars if you're a member of speak if it's before march twenty-fourth which it isn't  but uh anyhow   uh in the price of it breakfast there's a continental breakfast and lunch is included  uh there's a wine and cheese at the end  in the afternoon there are workshops  uh a lot of them based on multimedia  there are some uh there's a commercial presentation on some authoring programs  i've been helping with them  uh there are a couple of people doing things  speaking about ah uh using internet  uh there are people talking about how to create and use a multimedia lab  uh and there are a couple more  those are the afternoon sessions  question audience and speaker a responds   the easiest way to get information the fast   phone the speak office continues with a group discussion until tape ends   these galleries are in chronological order  so it goes from the oldest art in this room  uh in fact this is the oldest painting on the wall uh right here  saint catherine of alexandria  it was made in thirteen twenty  and then as we continue really following the perimer   perimeter of a large rectangle then we follow ah more or less this chronological history of art  so we go from the oldest gradually to the newer around the other side  so what i thought we'd do is start in the second room ah with a mid-fifteenth century work by uh hans memling  so it'd be over here tape cuts out   so this is a painting by uh hans memling  it was made for fourteen ninety-two  if you look later on you'll actually see the date inscribed in the painting itself  ehm we we have to remember that when we're looking at a painting that is five hundred years old uh of course  this painting was not made for us and uh it certainly was not made for an art gallery  mostly cos that concept didn't exist a place to come in and just look at works of art  uh and it certainly didn't have a label beside it giving us  all kinds of information  so instead for the mostly illiterate people of the time they would have been able to look at this painting  i know there's writing on the frame  but just by looking at the painting itself they would have been able to understand certain things  in particular they would have realized that the man who is kneeling is also the person who's paid for this painting to be made  can you tell me what detail about him would have let us know that he's paid for the painting   answer to question   ya   can you see what he has around his waist  it's kind of a belt and there's a uh a  kind of purse or a bag hanging from his ehm waist   so can you and if you look really closely   you see the purse is in fact open  can you see any mon money  inside   answer   why not  answer   that's right cos he paid for the painting  so it's very clear  this is typical of the renaissance where uh we see these images that are really quite close to everybody's daily lives  so every object is there because it has a specific meaning  he's being presented by his patron saint who is saint anthony abbot uhm the bearded man  can you see what objects he has with him  word   a cane mhh hmm   answer   pardon me  response   ya   can you see the pig or the wild boar  points out element of painting   and a bell  exactly   so uhh the way he's dressed the cane the bell and the pig are all the symbols or the attributes of saint anthony abbot  ehm does anybody else know who those other two figures are  this is a christian image so can you guess who they are  answer   mary and jesus  uh does anyone know if mary usually wears red like that  no  what does she normally wear multiple responses from audience  blue right with white  so laugh does she wear any blue here multiple responses from audience   ya right  so no she wears the blue right against her body but she wears the red  uhm people say it was a symbol of royalty and that therefore it tells us that she's represented here as mary queen of the world uhm but  it's also the symbol of divinity  you can see that the image of christ just beside is wearing a red  so that's why she doesn't re wear it right against here  so it's to show that w she's born an ordinary person  we also see that around this time there's a system of perspective that has been developed because what we have is   uhm the idea of painting is to convince us that this is not in fact a flat surface on which there's different paint uhm on the surface itself but rather that this is a space and we're loo   really looking at this painting as if we're looking through a window out onto the world  so we have have you done any perspective drawings at school   answer   ya  ah do you know what perpective drawings are  answer   answer   yes  answer   ya exactly   so we don't want this to look flat  we want it to look three dimensional so you can see the lines all move towards this vanishing point  do you see the floor in particular   right  where the tiles quite large in the foreground and as they move towards the background you get towards the vanishing point because all the lines will eventually converge  in fact if you look at this painting you can see that the ehm  lines ehm converge at about the top of jesus' head  you see that the baby's head   so that in fact it's leading our eye to him who is largely the most important part of the painting  uhm if you look at the background uhm you can see that kind of throne   who is that attached to or linked with   who does the throne belong to   hmm   it's mary right  why  how do we know it's mary's throne  answer   cos of the colour right  the red in the throne links it with the colour red she's wearing  ehm and you also see some fabric as part of the design of the throne  do you see a fruit in particular that is part of that  uh ah the fabric design   answer   there's the apple in jesus' head the uh  hand uh the symbol of redemption  but there's also a fruit that's part of the fabric design or the tapestry design  ya the pineapple right  laugh so the pineapple was actually the symbol of hospitality so the artist in representing that was inviting the   ve viewer us the viewer to look at the image  so what i'm just trying to give you an idea of very quickly is how even though these images are quite realistic we hardly see the paint brush stroke at all every thing is very well painted each object is there because it symbolizes something specific and we call that the iconography  have you heard of the word icon before   where do we see or have icons now   answer   ya in windows  in computers right   so if you think of what an icon does on a computer you click on this little sign right or little uhm design and each one represents something else  if you think of the painting it's exactly the same kind of system  each little object whether it be the cane the pig the pineapple has a specific symbolism  does that make sense  a little bit  yes  okay so uhm just to give you an idea generally of the language of painting at the time this is a flemish painting and they were especially strong in different iconography  ehm also at this time you would have never had ah an ordinary  portrait of a person by himself uh but only in such a painting that you call a donor painting
