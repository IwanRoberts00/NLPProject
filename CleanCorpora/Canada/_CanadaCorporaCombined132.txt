 you're going back to to uh rights are rights are rights again  and uh we uh don't need that  well we're seeing a repeat of uh ah uhm party discipline because none of the west island west end m n as  member of the national assembly are willing to talk aout this  that's the first thing that's very interesting  even people like russel copman and russ williams and so on are uh not going to stray from the party line  they're going to hue to the straight and narrow on this one cos daniel johnson wants it so  uh and let's not forget that alan rock himself and uh   just before the last referendum called it a mere technicality uh that quebec might or might not have the right to decide its own future   i mean the federal government itself supported this in the last one  and you'll also remember well this wou   would well this time around john charest is on side with daniel johnson   john charest no less than the leader of the part   progressive conservative party one of the most outspoken advocates of federalism in the last referendum campaign is saying that the federal government is off base on this one  so daniel johnson's got some pretty strong uh got some pretty strong support from people that i trust  he's got some pretty bad support in the courts because you know it seems to me that what they are saying is it doesn't matter what the law says we're going to go ahead and break the law if necessary  we are above the law   and that's one hell of a dangerous thing for any people who are political leaders to do  s see i don't   i don't believe that  i i believe uh  absolutely believe that if any province not just quebec if any province were to have a straight question and a a  real majority of the people made it clear that they want out i believe that you have to do it constitutionally  but i believe it would be done  i i believe that if british columbia were to say the hell with it we're we're a pacific nation and we don't care about canada or the other side of the rockies we want out of here i believe that if it was clear question and a clear majority that the constitution would be amended to let them do it  perhaps it would but the question is and the cos   cos bouchard has consistently said we have that right now under the law   we can declare u d i unilaterally declare independence and that's the question  and and i don't think they have that right and i can't imagine a court will say they have that right  quite true if you have a large majority on a clear question yes you certainly have to deal with it  but to say that you're going to do it without regard for the law is quite another matter  well you're right about that and the interesting thing is  that it's really not clear what has priority in this province  i did a show on this yesterday and found that there were law professors who fell down on the side of oh wha we're a constitutional country and the constitution above all versus the people who fell on the other side who said well the constitution yes but self-determination yes and the united nations recognizes a people's right to self-determination  even the experts don't agree what is paramounts in this country  we may think it's the constitution but   not everybody says so   well so   so all the more reason why you get an answer  and it seems to me to ask the court what its view is an eminently sensible thing to do  and i cannot imagine why ottawa would be forbidden to take part in a case which asks the court that question  the old story eh an expert is somebody who's more than fifty miles from home  yeah laugh yes  by by the way on   on the others to come back to to   john dan to daniel johnson  again what troubles me is that when we talk about lucien uh  laugh not lucien when we talk about daniel johnson's leadership  the word is leadership and to simply go where the crowd is does not indicate that you are a leader  now i'll agree with you on that   well we wa yeah but hang on   we want him to be vociferous and screaming about rights and supporting the federal government and all of this we forget that he in has to take the long view on this thing  and his advisors are telling him daniel take the long view on this one because you could yet win a provincial election against lucien bouchard   well then you you  have to take graham's point of view  leadership not what his what his advisors are telling him  well yeah but this is only remember we think that this is the end of the world   we think that this is one of the great moments in uh duh ehm deciding moments uh beeping starts on the tape and continues to end of speaker's turn defining moments   in canadian history  uh life will go on after whatever the court rules  maybe so but it's still a defining moment  no no i disagree  daniel johnson is he playing it right  is any politician playing it ri right  tape fades out   commercial and then intro music   okay let's fill up those lines here  they're not all full  we have a couple available at seven nine two three four five one   we're talking about uh the political situation over the last uh what since last thursday or friday i guess  uh it's been hot and heavy uh and there not " there's"  been some question about who's doing it right and who's doing it wrong  uh jean chr&eacute;tien uh ehm and mario dumont we haven't heard from him have we daniel johnson the premier bernard landry  uh who's done it right and who's done it wrong and how are you feeling at this point about daniel johnson  uh do you feel he is properly holding up his end uh of this uh debate this conversation  do you feel that he's uh put himself in a spot or do you feel that he's uh doing things uh right and properly  seven nine two three four five one to get in on the conversation  hello jeff   yes uhem hi george british speaker continues point   well i think obviously those are problems that would have to be uh settled eventually you no doubt about that   but i think that uh mister bertrand's basic uh concept is that   under in in the nineteen eighty referendum rene levesque was saying i want permission to talk to the voters about going our own way and if as and when we work out a deal uh we'll have a vote again to accept the deal okay  that was quite different than this time when mister parizeau was saying we are going to vote on independence for quebec we are then going to make an offer to canada after a yes vote and if we don't have a deal with canada within one year tough luck we're on our own  now that's that's quite different  and that's what bertrand says is illegal that the constitution  doesn't call for that doesn't allow for that   response   nor am i nor am i  response laugh   yes i did see it   you have to admit that new cartoonist in la presse  who has replaced gerard is is pretty good actually  laugh   but he's obviously a very confirmed separatist  discussion   lysiane gagnon   discussion   yeah louise lysiane gagnon   discussion   yeah   so you have some faith in johnson at this point  yes   which is actually the question i'm asking people  how are they feeling about mister johnson at this point  mhhm yeah   thanks for calling  thank you   seven nine two three four five one is now available  hello garret   yes good afternoon george   no i'm not with johnson at all on this  i mean he's uh he's perceived as  being part of uh coming down on the side of the separatists and uh where is the opposition to them  there is absolutely no opposition in our our   national assembly  do do are are   you telling me that you think daniel johnson is a separatist  well he's a sometimes federalist  i don't know laugh whether he's a separatist or not  it's hard to figure him out  he's trying to be all things to all people  he's eh he's forgetting the uh  that the no people are with him but only if he sticks up for the no  i mean as far as uhm from what  what i can see uh during the last few days he seems to be on bouchard's side  hmh hmh  a and you're referring specifically to his ah agreeing that uhm the decisions about quebec's future have to be made by quebecers  well of course  but i mean we're we're not  dis i mean the the issue in the court is the legality of the constitution and i mean if he can't stand up for the legality of our canadian constitution then he's not a canadian    i feel anybody that is not backing that up isn't a true canadian  okay sir  thanks for calling  this is the star line and this would be alvin   al   yeah how are you george   i'm always fine  good  george i uhm support absolutely the federal government getting involved and as a matter of fact it's shocking to me how we've allowed the separatists to manage this entire episode over the last fifteen years  and a good example of that is let's look at the question they asked us  if i understand it correctly the question said do you give us permission to talk to the federal government and if that doesn't work out then certainly our option is to separate  am i correct that that was the correction  well they weren't really asking permission to talk to the federal government as i understood the question  they were saying we're going to vote to become sovereign  however having voted to become sovereign we're going to offer an association with canada and if they accept it in a way that we accept within a year fine otherwise we go our own way  word   but then they come back and they take their forty-nine percent and they say well here are our forty-nine percent of the population who support separation  which is untrue  they a good  goodly portion of that forty-nine percent support  negotiation with the federal government   that this is true  and and yet you know   you're talking about two million people who voted yes and a lot of them weren't for total independence  and nobody questions him about that  it's incredible  i hear them in speaking to the federal politicians and being quoted in the press  and it's startling to me  so yes absolutely the rules have to be fair for both parties and they haven't been up to now  and daniel johnson  daniel johnson's a nobody  and i'm afraid that there are two two  entities here to deal with one called the federal government and the other one are the power-grabbers in quebec city  i'm sorry but daniel johnson and all the other individuals like mister charest who i i can't understand this guy either   where does he sit  did you hear what he said this morning  he said to the effect i believe uh that uh quebec should d decide its destiny   yeah  i i can't figure him out  he i mean i would have thought he was the kind of guy who was open-minded and bright enough to realize that it's a canadian issue as well as a quebec issue   okay sir  thanks   thanks   thanks  hello julia   automated voice message saying, " words  nouveau"   whoa the nouveau means there's nobody there the nouveau so we'll go to somebody else  where would you like me to go here steve uh  steve is in charge of this program  you always thought that i had something to do with it but  word   okay we'll go to evan on number one  hello evan   yes hello george   hi  george uh i watch politics and that's no way to convince a person to vote  uh it shows that the people   wh what's  no way  well the way they're acting uh for instance should know about canada and uh that you know that all members of parliament must swear an ode not " oath" of allegiance to the queens and   and that is pledging to uphold her every action
