 but i thought it was kind of it gave it  a different flavour  what were the things that were on display  their work from the year like uhm oh gosh  from from paintings to mechanisms to maquettes to  poetry on bark and like some of the uhm japanese rice paper  hmm   is it chinese rice paper  well that   word   there was  i'm not sure if it's japanese or chinese laugh   maybe it's just  but just   chinese   chinese cos theirs ya word one with the rice paddies  there's usually an innovative style to the projects  like there's thought forethought and there's societal environmental impact and blah you know all these sort of things  so they're interesting  they're not it's not they're not most they they're  they do exist but it's not mostly a piece of art that you look at and go oh isn't that beautiful and   although although  there's elements probably in there that are but usually they cause you to stop and examine and study and think and discuss  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and that's what's encouraged in the programs  thought provoking objects  mhh hmm  thought pieces  ya  interesting  trying to teach our designers to have a conscience  hmm  basically   i'm glad to hear somebody's going to have a conscience  ya  basically a designer affects his environment  his or her environment and you have to be very careful on the impact to society when you do that and that's what we teach our  designers  so i can rest assured that if i hire a designer from concordia i know i'm getting one of the best right  the president of our student association called us up this morning and uh they they've decided to do a logo for the department  and they've also decided that they're going to put out caps  they're going to sell caps for  cos this exhibit that they have at the year no " end" cost them a fortune like thousands and thousands of dollars  uh huh   and they're going to put out caps to sell and even a line of jackets  and like they're really going to go all out laugh   so i told the guy i said i want you to know i'm waiting for these caps cos i want to buy one laugh i'm not going to buy any  other cap  laugh   have do you have a company that  uh that makes caps  i don't know   why do you know one in mind  well there's uhh a fellow who uhm who  has a daughter at a child anyway at  greenvale school and he owns a company that makes caps  mh hmm   mh hmm  yup  and uh he does a lot of caps  well in fact uhm one of our neighbours was telling us they went down to p e i prince edward island: canadian province and they bought a hat for their son and when they got back they just happened to glance down at the uhm at the label and laugh  they realized it was laugh this fella fellow  who had made the hat  and apparently he he makes thousands and thousands of hats for all all kinds of organizations and whatnot  uh huh  and uh cough we were talking about getting hats for our school at one point for a fundraiser and uh they  people were coming up with various names and i said i think i have a name i think so knock at the door. an extracorpus speakers enters the room and communicates ( by miming?) with speaker a   come in  hello   pardon  yes but you can speak  it's okay  you don't wish to speak   word alright   okay   yes please  go ahead laugh   laugh   here you go sound of door shutting. extracorpus speaker leaves room.   we share  laugh we drank her water so she's going to eat up my salad dressing  anyway i believe that he donated uh like his  his way of donating to the school was to offer his services  and and so whatever they sold i think they just paid for the materials basically  so he didn't make any money off of it and whatever they sold was their profit so  uh huh   oh good  uhm  that's good  that's a very good re resource  to have volunteered  mh hmm   ya exactly  i know we were talking about him because anabelle  when we were camping uhm uh  you know anabelle is uhm the little girl who has alopecia  she has no hair  ya ya  and she was playing soccer   how is she doing by the way  oh there's only a twenty percent chance that her hair will ever grow back  how did they derive at that   at the twenty percent  ya   uhm i think it's just on past experience with patients that have alopecia totalis  mhh   uhm there are other forms of alopecia where the alopecia comes and goes but because she's lost all her body hair uhm uh   they she has been declared as alopecia totalis and only twenty percent of the cases have actually grown back hair  so   and sometimes only for only ah a very short period of time and then they lose it again  so in a way i'm hoping that if she does grow back hair that she that it it it   grows back ya and in one fell swoop and that  she doesn't have partial  because that would be harder to deal with  stays   mhh hmm   mhh   mhh  but uhm things haven't changed much  so it's almost two years now that she's uh that she's had it  anyway it's quite a problem now because she plays soccer  uhm she plays on the inter-city team for uh the tetras   and uhm there's a rule in inter-city soccer wa and i think it probably applies as well to uhm to house league soccer you're not allowed to wear a baseball cap  because the peak of the cap can be quite dangerous if  you're if you collide or somebody can get it in the eye or something  ohh   oh ya   so apparently they've had accidents   can't she wear a tam though like  no she wouldn't wear a tam  like you you also have to you also have to   realize that she's at an age now where she's going to have her own preferences  so what she did last year was she wore bandanas  those sort of western-looking bandanas  okay   and uhm that was okay but uhm i think she still felt a bit like a sore thumb and so what happened was uhm the girl that used to babysit her is quite a sewer one who sews and so she  designed a little kerchief kind of thing  it's like a bandana but it's shaped in somewhat of a triangular shape uhm out of black fabric  their colours are black and orange and yellow  so she came up with this black fabric and she designed this triangular shape that would be easy for them to wear  and uh they took it to the company that does the uniforms and they had the logo uh put on the bandana in the front  ahh   and uhm they had two of them made  one for her and one for a friend who like her friend who supports her  it happens to be the lady whose son it happens to be her daughter  uhm she is a really big supporter and she feels that if she's wearing one it's going to make the little girl with alopecia feel more comfortable  and so the whole team wants them now   so uhm ya ya  oh neat ya   so they went back and said they wanted more and the guy came up with some outrageous figure of eighteen dollars per bandana  i said that's crazy  so i suggested to them that maybe they go and see this guy who makes the caps and maybe he can do something   cos he was he was trying different designs last year to come up with something for her but nothing that he came up with she felt comfortable with but she really likes this bandana  so they all look like pirates wearing them but  but if i don't know it gives them that kind of mean edge that i suppose you need as a   as a competitive sports player you know  laugh   but i said what a wonderful thing  the whole team decided that they liked them and they wanted to wear them for her sake  and i think that really said something to the kids    uh that's wonderful   ya  that's so heartwarming  ya ya when they told me that i said wow what a good team  ya   but they've been playing together for a number of years  she's been playing inter-city now for at least two years  this is probably her third year  mhh hmm   is charlie in soccer  ya she starts tonight  where does she where is she playing  she plays uh in grier park which is  uh huh   she plays house league though  she doesn't play inter-city  i don't want her playing inter-city  what's what's the difference  i'd like carley to have been in it   it's actually is you're  playing against other teams from other cities  okay   right  so you could be playing lachine or you could be playing st laurent  right  and most of the games are at six six-thirty at night  right  so somebody's got to get home pick them up get  them in their uniforms and get them   to the to the game on time  huh   okay   how did you get into this  so   like where did you find out about it and   uh it's through the city  i can give you the names of the people but you're really late  ya   uhm you she  wouldn't be able to play on on the same team as  charlie though  i might do that   charlie 's playing in a league that's beyond her age  uhm she's supposed to be playing atom but we put her into mosquito  uhm carley would have to play atom  just co cos this is her fourth year playing and some of the kids she'd be playing atom with i felt she would probably be really bored with them  mhh hmm   so we decided to put her up into mosquito  and the girls that she'll be playing with are  they were on her ringette team last winter  mhh hmm  so they have a fairly cohesive group  mhh hmm  and uhm and they're all  pretty much they all really understand the game  and i think if if you were to put somebody in there that didn't know how to play i think they'd get a little creamed you know   ohh right right right  so she'd be better off to go into atom  and i can give you the n guy's name   uhm word there's a couple people  is henry too young   no   henry no no no  henry henry is five  five and a half  he's going to be six   ya he could play  he can play  no problem  they can both play   is it very expensive   inhale when i registered i think it was sixty or sixty-five  but then if  that was in february  if you late registered in march it was a little bit more  mhh  so i would think it might be around seventy or seventy-five  dollars is my guess   mhh hmm   the fellow who runs it is arnaud le jean   mhh hmm   and that's his phone number  do  there's also rob maur ic iano   and i'll get his number for you  he's probably the key person to speak with i would think  uhm so they   certainly carley would be in uh atom and in terms of henry i think he'd all i think he'd be in junior atom  atom   mhh hmm  uhm they were talking about an elite team which was an sort of like an inter-city team uhm at that age level and that's what they were thinking of putting  charlie on but i said no i'm not interested in that because you have to drive all over  word   i know  you you know it's  it's too much it's too much  so but certainly all the teams are forming have already been formed   yes  the teams have already been picked uhm but i spoke with with  rob last week cos what happened was for some reason they never got her into the mosquito list so she wasn't on the draft
