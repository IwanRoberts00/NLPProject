 it is a history however that has to be told  the government takes this issue very seriously and is looking into how best to set the record straight and to symbolize our recognition of this sad event this very sad event in our history  madame speaker in more recent times the government of canada has acted to protect its citizens from this kind of treatment   the canadian charter of rights and freedoms guarantees equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination  through the canadian multiculturalism act the parliament of canada has recognized that our society is fundamentally multicultural in nature and has committed itself to the full and equitable participation of individuals and communities of all origins in shaping canada's future  the war a measures act as an example madame speaker has been repealed by this government   encouraged to immigrate to canada by canadian governments ukrainians were a vital part of the settlement process of canada particularly in the prairies  ukrainian settle settlers in the prairies madame speaker wanted no more than the chance to live and work in the indignity in this country in this country of canada    the ukrainians were among the founding settlers of canada especially important in settling the prairies  between eighteen ninety-one and nineteen fourteen one hundred and seventy thousand yur ukrainians one hundred and seventy thousand came to canada  and between the wars another sixty-eight thousand ukrainians came to canada  and after the great war thirty-three thousand more u  ukrainians immigrated to canada  ukrainians did settle however in small numbers in canada long before the mass migration or immigration that took place in eighteen ninety-one  according to the publication the canadian family tree there were soldiers of ukrainian origin in the de meuron and de wattville regiments which fought for canada in the war of eighteen twelve  some ukrainians settled in this in this time period  before this time period actually during the period  of of lord selkirk in manitoba   there're also ukrainians who settled in manitoba coming from the united states prior to eighteen ninety-one  madame speaker in the beginning the ukrainians faced a very difficult life in the prairies as they broke into this land and broke the land itself  in spite of this harsh existence community cultural and social life grew with a variety of organizations  womens' groups newspapers and periodicals architecture folk arts and poetry developed over the years  in nineteen oh five the ukrainian mutual benefit association was founded in affiliation with the saint nicholas ukrainian catholic church in winnipeg  among these ukrainian workers and farmers there emerged a credit union movement which began in nineteen thirty-nine when the new community savings and credit union was founded in saskatoon  and by the end of the nineteen sixties over sixty ukrainian credit unions served an estimated membership of fifty thousand people  over time the ukrainian-canadians like their fellow  citizens citizens had become an urban people  according to the nineteen eighty-one census there were  sixty-three thousand ukrainians in edmonton fifty-nine thousand in winnipeg fifty-one thousand in toronto   other major centres of ukrainian population are vancouver  montreal calgary saskatoon hamilton thunder bay regina and the niagara peninsula  of the five hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred and fifteen ukrainians in canada in nineteen nine uh excuse me madame speaker nineteen eighty-one fifty-nine percent lived in the prairie provinces and twenty-five point three percent lived in ontario  much of the cultural struggle for the ukrainian-canadian community  was has involved the maintenance of its language  in recent years bilingual and even trilingual education with  french teaching included madame speaker has been offered in the publicly supported education systems of the prairie provinces   ukrainians are a vital part of the cultural fabric of canada  to quote from the ukrainian community development committee report for the prairie regions published in nineteen eighty-six by the  ukai ukrainian - canadian committee the ukrainian situation as an ethno-cultural minority is a very special one permanently woven into the fabric of canadian society   over one thousand organizations exist within the ukrainian community  the painting of uh william kurelek inspired by his experience on the pare prairies have been widely recognized and george ryga is a writer of ukrainian origin of a national  stature madame speaker  ukrainians have long been involved in municipal politics as well  william hawrelak in edmonton and steven juba in winnipeg have been prominent mayors and the first ukrainian elected to the provincial legislature was andrew shandro in nineteen thirteen in alberta  in nineteen twenty-six michael luchkovich became the first ukrainian elected to the house of commons  over two hundred ukrainian-canadians have been elected provincially  another sixty have been elected to the house of commons  in nineteen seventy stephen worobetz became the lieutenant governor of s of saskatchewan   and of course a former honourable member of this house his excellency ray hnatyshyn now serves the country as governor general   and madame speaker during the second world war approximately forty thousand ukrainian-canadians served in the canadian armed forces   ukrainian-canadians form a vital part of canadian life  they are important exponents of recognition of the multicultural nature of canada  we must not forget however the history of the treatment of  of ukrainians that took place during the first world war  we must ensure that present and future generations of canadians understand the reality of canadian history including events such as ukrainian internment  many canadians are unaware the details of these events or  or even   they are even unaware madame speaker that they took place  they are seldom mentioned in the official history books or in museum exhibits or in popular press reports about historical events  madame speaker i'm grateful to the honourable member for this motion and for the occasion to speak about the ukrainian internment  more important madame speaker i'm grateful for those members of the ukrainian-canadian community for increasing public awareness about this history  without this knowledge of history we risk repeating the same kinds of mistakes whenever world crises break out or stoke the embers of fear and intolerance  in one of the most important conclusions of the spicer committee  report last summer was that canadians need a greater knowledge of their history and of themselves and of each other  and madame speaker if we are to remain together as a country   we wa we must encourage the recounting and the hearing of our histories  thank you madame speaker  introduce next speaker   yes  thank you uh madame speaker  uh i attended a meeting on behalf of the minister uhh i guess it would be probably about a year and a half ago at which the ukrainian redress committee uhh had a press conference and uh basically told their story  and i think it's a story that is the story of a minority in canada that still hurts  so i think that this motion that uh mister milliken has presented is one that should be given every consideration by the government  the government is committed to doing something to redress this uh historical wrong committed by previous a previous  uh government of canada and i think that the suggestions of mister milliken are certainly excellent ones that should be given every consideration so i will certainly support the referral of the motion  thank you   point of order madame speaker  allows c to speak   madame speaker i wanted to thank the honourable member for all honourable members the honemeber   honourable member for burlington edmonton-east carleton-charlotte and don valley-north for their kind interventions  and i since there is unan  unanimity on this point i wonder if uh rather than drop the motion it could be uh carried by unanimous consent   agrees   conducts vote and carries motion   ends parliamentary session   and you're listening to radio noon  my name is mary henny   it is now three degrees in downtown montreal  i'm going to give you the forecast in uh just a moment or so but first i want to tell you what's on the program today  uhm there uh is th this   it is becoming stran  stranger curiouser and curiouser about what might have happened on referendum night in terms of the voting  we have been following quite closely the issue of spoiled ballots  now there comes allegations that ah some of the votes were switched  yes and no votes were were switched  we're going to be speaking with johnston smithfield who's an investigative reporter at the gazette  he has uncovered these uh these  allegations  we're going to find out more from him about what it might mean  david finnigan has this story of a signmaker  it's a woman who makes these wooden signs in her basement  and david will have that story for us  it is tuesday and we have the radio noon farm panel  and on the phone-in today would you buy private homecare insurance  i've heard time and time again on this program mostly since the uhh news of the hospital closures came out in the spring people calling in very afraid of what that might mean  because as you know the regional health boards are saying that this is part of an entire restructuring of healthcare  that too many people are spending too much time in hospital  we don't need so many hospitals  close some down have the hospital stay shortened and have people sent home to recover and recuperate  and and there's a lot of wisdom in that  people are a lot more comfortable at home  course the big question is who looks after them at home  most of these people after an operation or or  any sort of treatment probably aren't capable of looking after themselves  particularly if you're elderly and if you're alone  there's a lot of fear out there  fear fuelled as well by the fact that if you call up the c l s c today centre local de services communautaires ( clinics) chances are they won't be able to send you anyone  but the c l s c's say that it'll get better as you heard  john peggoty reporting today  uh they are going to be getting considerably more money  a lot of that is going to go into home care and they say it's going to improve  but we also hear today from blue cross which is a private healthcare company and it says that it is going to step in where it sees a need  and it is offering private homecare insurance  for seventy dollars more a year if you already have one of their plans seventy dollars more a year  you can guarantee that someone will come in to your home and look after you  if you are sick if you're sent home from the hospital  a lot of people find that a very attractive offer  c l s c's are c are screaming foul saying that is that will completely undermine them  it's going to create this two-tiered system where the wealthy  get uh homecare and and the poorer don't get homecare  a whole lot of issues  our question for you would you buy private homecare insurance  that's next hour on the phone-in  and in fact we're going to start the discussion just before one o'clock when i speak to someone from blue cross to find out more about what it is that they are offering   now if you were sent home early after an operation at the hospital do you trust that the c l s c centre local de services communautaires ( clinics) would be able to send you someone to help you recuperate  the blue cross private health insurance uh company doesn't think so  so it has set up a private policy  it is a private homecare insurance and it has people really steamed at the c l s cs  our question next hour would you buy private homecare insurance music, drum roll at end   laugh now you knew that was coming  the beauty of it is you don't know quite when  it's three degrees right now in downtown montreal  storm on the way overnight  fifteen centimetres of snow expected  seventy kilometre an hour winds  uh by tomorrow morning it's supposed to change into ice pellets and freezing rain and rain by noon tomorrow  but a really bad night expected tonight in ah the montreal chateauguay a and townships as well as the laurentiens area
