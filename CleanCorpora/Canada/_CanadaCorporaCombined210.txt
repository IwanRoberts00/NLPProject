 right  we want to get something more meaningful out of it  so i'll ask you does the image remind you of anything in particular  response   the crucifixion  but of course you only see the vertical part of the image  right  would you like to see the horizontal this cross is completed   responds   laugh okay   it's just one way of pushing that even further  but can you see how this sculpture is on a base and we uh barely see the legs underneath the base cos it's slightly recessed   but it creates a space between the base and the floor  see what i mean by that  and how it's filled with a shadow   so ya just let your eyes focus on that shadow  am i in the way for some of you   okay i won't move   for let's say five or ten seconds then we'll look up at the vertical beam for another few seconds   do you want me to get out of the way tape cuts out   optical illusion but you should see a faint white line that completes the crosses  see what i mean   have most of you seen it audience responds affirmatively  okay  makes a point   laugh actually it works really well if you  crouch down but   kay okay so we'll come and we'll look at it much more closely tape cuts out   uh well when we get up close you can start you see the surface of the sculpture  you can see that it's rusty  it's made out of core tin steel  and we actually uh also see this pronounced rusty line  right here   what does that make you think of   the blood right  so uh if you think of what i just did i just asked you what you saw  i sure that i pushed a little bit further by having you look at the shadow but what you just told me comes from you  i didn't say this is this this is this  so again just to reiterate what i said before what we get out of these works depends entirely on what we give to them  if we come to this with a background completely foreign to christianity then we're not going to see this as the image of the crucifixion  right  you're going to see it in a different way  uhm i think one of the s sad   things about this painting is that it's true we bring our background to the work and many people just brought this huge price tag with  the with them as the background and they could only look at it as a consumer object  so they they never let the experience go beyond being a shopping centre right where you're surprised when the price is more expensive than you thought it would be  so uhm you know just look at these works i'd say and the artist made them for you was hoping that you'll probably get or that you'll get something out of them  so it's really up to us and the more we have to give the more we'll get out of it  does that make sense   you have any questions   okay  ehm we will continue into the impressionist room tape cuts out  so we're in the room with uh impressionist and post-impressionist artists  this is a painting by uh vincent van gogh  have you heard about him  ya  do you know anything about him two audience members respond  uh laugh i think the story goes i'm not sure how  or the legend goes anyway that he sold one painting in his lifetime and uh that was to his brother or something  or his brother was an art dealer anyway   makes a point   ya it's true he did a lot of self-portraits  he did a lot of his paintings within just a few years  anything else that you know about him  makes a point   i don't know  i guess you only know the price when it's sold but one of his paintings sold for ninety-eight million  kay okay   so uh it wasn't it was bigger than this  this is on paper  but uhm you know like ah once you get into the millions there's not much difference between laugh fifty million and eighty million right  makes a point   ya you know in those days people were just labelled as insane and lived in institutions  you know he ch chopped off his ear  all of these things that are the subjects of movies and  and books audience members discuss amongst themselves  he didn't sell anything   it's actually wi it's wi   around this time where you have this break  or the this beginning of this idea about the artist starving and alienated from society instead of the typical artist  and that's why there's been so many movies and books written about him because he he lives kind of this quintessential uhm alienated artist life  but all of this is aside in a sense  but i think that it's all related because uhm when we look at his paintings more than the memling we just saw in the first   in the second room or other artists i think with van gogh somehow we get a sense of that it   his paintings capture his personality or we have a feeling that we know the artist himself through his art  and i think it it uh the reason why is perhaps uhm a useful way of looking at his work   for instance when we look at the grass growing in the background is he copying exactly what he sees repeating the same angles and trying to  medicul meticulously copy nature as it is exactly   no  right  but we s what we get for the first time is the artist deciding himself mostly hes at this time  implied comma what this painting's going to look like  so we have this subjective view  uh in this case the uhh each paint stroke   coincides which with a blade of grass so it kind of makes sense  but for instance if you look at the stems here you can see this blue outline  irises don't have blue stems right or blue outlines on them so we can see that the artist is even though he's inspired by nature as a subject matter he's deviating from it  he's deciding to in this case be influenced by japanese prints  that do have these black or bold outlines  so artists go for other to other sources  to make their art  also with van gogh you know we just spent a few minutes talking about his life  did we talk about hans memling's life or barnett newman's life not so much  with mo with modern art or i guess not barnett newman i shouldn't use an example but the renaissance artists we're not so interested in their lives but with modern art when we look at their paintings we f concentrate   on the artist's personal vision and or their ideas their style rather than the subject matter  i'm not going to go on for five minutes about what kind of irises they are and what time of year they grow or you know the specif  the specificities about the subject matter but we're more interested in how it's painted  and that's basically something that we could generalize with all modern art is we're interested in how it's painted more than what is painted  does that make sense  ya  so ah any questions about van gogh  the reason it's under glass is because it's on paper and uh it's a fairly fragile support  the paper has been mounted on canvas  so it's it's fairly secure  we have two other paintings by van gogh in this room the  flowers on uh either side of the far wall tape cuts out   somebody asked to see a picasso  who was that   anybody  nobody's owning up to it  did somebody mention picasso as an artist they wanted to see  audience member asks other audience members a question  okay   i guess i made that up  okay laugh   anyway ya laugh here's laugh a painting by uh pablo picasso  actually ehm we we've just   phrase   ya okay  get's a's attention   good  i'm not losing my mind laugh   uhm we've literally gone full circle and uh i mean in the galleries but also in the history of art   when we started with that painting hans memling the renaissance painting where all of these objects were meticulously painted i said that the ideal at that time was to pa to treat a painting as if you were looking through a window outside of the  wor in uh sorry outside into the world  ehm so you would substitute the window frame for the painting frame and you got this feeling of space  what we get with picasso is it's as if it's the same the same window is literally broken  so all of the sudden we see these flat planes that are intersecting and it creates a surface all of its own with its own interests  it's not trying to pretend to represent trees or forests or something that exists in the world but it's a surface that has its own entity that exists on its own  i having said that uhm there are certain elements that we can recognize  the title of this work is the small table  you see any elements of this table audience members respond   ya maybe the legs or something here that  ehm you see part of a guitar audience members respond   ya  i'm thinking more of here are the strings and then the upper part of the guitar up here  see the wallpaper on the wall behind it   ya  there's see the wallpaper back there  and then these letters are they are they   actual letters or are they paintings of letters   is there a difference between letters and paintings of letters  no  cos letters are a two dimensional sign for something  right  so there's you can't it it there's  no difference really  so by putting letters on the surface what the artist is saying this is a flat surface on which these things are signs  so it's it's it's a way of treating laugh ah well  interrupts a   so he's saying i'm not trying to say this is a real bowl of fruit but this is something on its own  gets a's attention   it's paint on a canvas  so it's affirming the fact this is two dimensional and it's not this space  you know we're looking at this in nineteen ninety-five  we just saw barnett newman's voice of fire which is totally  flat and has no object represented or depicted in it at all  so we have to think of looking at this in nineteen nineteen where this was quite new to see these spaces and ah forms represented in a completely new way  so generally we i guess we could call this a cubist painting although uhm something like that round one is ah a much better example of typical cubism tape cuts out   i'll bring you back down into the canadian galleries  we'll just quickly pass by the chapel rideau street convent chapel   i'll show you where it is anyway  and then the group of seven and then uhm what you can do is find the elevator from off there  do you know what how to get there  tape continues as a conversation between a and a few members of the group    i'm working here at the museum  i'm in the education department  and we're gonna going to be doing an exhibition today called rights and realities  you've got the uhm word material for it so you've at least seen some of the slides and you know a little about what you're going to look at  kay okay we're going to break it up into a cou a couple of different ways of one going through the exhibition and two talking a little bit about work that you're doing yourselves combining this all in  it's really nice having a small group cos i like it to be really informal  so as much talking back and forth  if you have questions ask  you know i'm ya i like to go off the track sometimes if there's something about the exhibition or about something in photogrqaphy that you want to know more about  first thing i'm going to do is tell you something about the c m c p canadian museum of contemporary photography this museum  have you ever been here before   so this is all your first trip  alright i can give you some background on the institution cos that helps you understand what the collection is all about  cos we have ah a collection that's really split into two really distinct uhm categories  that being uhh documentary photography and what's considered art photography or experimental photography uhm using different mediums  other photographic style and genre  originally in nineteen forty-one uh c m c p was part of the national film board and everybody knows the national film board  uh it is the still photography division which was very important  it was a unit that went across canada documenting the country  it was one of the best methods that canada had for selling canada to immmigration post-war immigration and it was also a way of solidifying a real canadian identity or fostering an idea of a canadian identity  in terms of because of the expanse of the land people out on the west coast were able to see photographs from people on the east coast and so it brought communities together
