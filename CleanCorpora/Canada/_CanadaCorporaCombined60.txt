 mhh hmm  practical things  ya  i've had hi history   you know theory up to here   that's true that's true   you know and history and all this  kind of  stuff   i know   no go in if you go into a classroom you'll   i mean it's interesting but i mean i want to learn the the stuff that i can use and i feel that that's one thing that we really haven't gotten enough of  that's true  so uhm i guess that's what we'll find out  and if i'm with these teachers who know a lot of  techniques well then  i'll learn a great  deal about these kinds of things and can use it later  ya mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   ya  and you know a lot of times you hear about these techniques but if you don't see them or experience them or do them  you you you   no you have to do them   ya it's like being a dental hygienist  ya exactly   you could go to school for ever and a day  that's right   you can't you can't   be a dental hygienist until you actually clean somebody else's teeth   for heaven's sake you know  that's right   ya and for a few years too  that's right   and then you know how to do it properly  that's right   ya   so there's no question  that experience is the best teacher  oh ya   that's for sure  but you know it's like they say they won't   har hire you unless you have experience and you can't get experience unless somebody hires you  ya   so it's that's a problem  ya   well actually this girl who did her practicum at that school  in st eustache she was hired   one of the girls in your class  that made   no last year  okay  she graduated and uhm we exchanged phone numbers and uhm i called her up just because i was panicking about my first teaching thing   because i got thrown in there so quick  and i didn't  know what i was supposed to do  oh ya   ya   ya it's scary   and we didn't really have much information   ya i don't know what   we were just told okay do it you know  and i didn't even know what a pre-activity was or a   word   they didn't tell you any of   no no no no no   that's really strange   i know   didn't you have methods methodology  ya but we hadn't gotten to that part yet  we were just talking about what makes a good teacher  wha now you're doing methodology   laugh ya now  oh that's so silly  it's / - > ya it should have been right at the beginning  or it should have been before your practice teaching  before the teaching   right  but it wasn't  ya see something like that   we're just getting into that now and i've already taught twice  ya  so uhm no we were getting into other things like uhm  you know characteristics of a good teacher and how to make groups  and you know all these different things which are certainly practical but uh  didn't prepare us for our first  teaching   experience   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   hmm   mhh hmm   so uhm  so she was hired at that school  ya  so she got a job  not at that school  wow   okay  at a different school but with an intensive e s l program  how did she get the job  well she thinks it was because she did her practicum there  at that other school that had an intensive program  mhh hmm   so she got hired by this different school  did she apply to the school board   or something  i think so   i think so   like when you say you're gonna  going to finish in april  ya ya ya ya ya ya ya   that's great  so are you gonna going to  apply   i assume you'll apply for a job as a  teacher in in all the  proper places or something  right   ya ya ya   see what happens   i hope so laugh   no i was just cutri  curious yes you know  ya   ya so i'll start putting my name in  ya   but i i don't know  i i might be starting a master's program too   okay   but then i wouldn't mind teaching part- time  and doing a master's program too  uh huh   mhh hmm  that's actually what i'm hoping to do  what would you do your master's in  uhm that's what i'm thinking about right now  but uhm i'm thinking about either linguistics or education  mhh hmm  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  because i think uh education could be a good field to get into because i think we are getting into uhm educational reform in this country and  you think so  you think you know it seems to be less demand for teachers   than there was   less demand for teachers but i think we need different schools or a different kind of a system  well we need a different type of a system but will we get  you know what i'm saying   no no but look what's happening to the hospitals  ya  i think  so it's gonna going to    you know does it pay to be a nurse  or whatever because they're closing up the hospitals whether they  need to or not  we uh   i i don't know like   mhh hmm   right  but i think more and more parents are wanting to  uh find something better for their kids  are demanding   mhh hmm  and i think that the dropout rate also is becoming uh a real problem for society and i think  other alternatives have to be  mhh hmm   well there's no question   i'm i'm not saying that everything's going to be totally changed but maybe there has to be uhm other alternatives added to what we already have   and uh maybe uh more of a reform in the  mind rather than anything else about how to approach learners and uh schools   word   mhh hmm   sounds good  sounds good  sounds good   sounds good   well i hope so  anyway listen   it is   once you're taking all those courses and to  you know hopefully one gets a job you know  well ya  that's it too  sometimes i wonder   but then michael and i we could be sent to indonesia or something you know and then you know   really   ya   because   he will he will be  transferred   it's it's a possibility because his company does do a lot of work overseas and well i'm interested in traveling somewhere too  ya sure   for sure   and uhm so   well then you could always teach there  well that's right  so it's two words   but i'd rather have a master's because it opens up a lot more possibilities and   i word i see  sure that's  and it's great for you if you you know can travel anywhere then   you could always you could do  this anywhere  ya   ya   that's right  ya  that's that's pretty  good  ya   ya  so i mean i i don't know for sure  mhh hmm   these are just the directions that my mind  is going into   uhm but i think i wanna want to  start a master's program uhm cos i just feel like ya if i'm traveling too it will open a lot more uh  possibilities   i think so   ya   especially today  ya yup  so many people have master's now   mhh hmm   it's as common as a bachelor's was  not that long ago  uhh   i know   that's right  even a p h d has become quite the thing  right  most of you know  bang in background whoops  a lot of the professors are here or whatever that have  a p h d  mhh   oh ya   a master's is just nothing   ya   right  ordinary  ya ya   i know  well i have this one teacher he's got four master's and two p h ds  wow  teaching english lit here  i just about died   and they don't think   it's silly almost you know   well yes yes  but what are you going to do with all those degrees anyway  ya   i don't know  teach first year english you know laugh   i have a friend who only has a high school diploma  ya  he's making more money than all those p h ds put together   oh i bet  what does he do   he's he buys and sells   stuff  ahh   hmm  and he's just growing by leaps and bounds daily and he's  not 'he' just doesn't know what to do with all his money  gee   he's making money hand over fist  he has a high school education  ya it's amazing  and it seems that more and more people are so over-educated there aren't any jobs for doctors lawyers and p h ds  well that's right   mhh hmm  unless you wanna want to  teach english lit   that's right   ya ya  anyway so   no that's true  that's very true  wha wha but what  kinds of things does he buy and sell  he buys and sells close-outs  you know if a company's company is   going out of business he'll buy all the the  stuff  oh ya   you know wise brothers went out of business  oh ya ya ya ya   i don't know if you remember   ya   so he bought all the inventory and he'll sell it to dollar stores or various other stores  mhh hmm   right  and he'll buy uhh you know different stuff that people can't sell  mhh hmm   he'll he looks around for close-outs  it's it's quite the   the big business   ahh booming business huh   wow you have no idea  he uh just started a few years ago and he's   doesn't know what to do with all his money  exhale   gee   wow  ya literally  really really   ya well we certainly need more people like that too you know laugh   ya an entre  entrepreneur to be an entrepreneur now that's the only way to make money  certainly can't make money by working by the hour  no  no matter i always say no matter  how much even if i get a raise in my job another few dollars an hour even if i make laugh you know there's only a certain amount of hours in a day  mhh hmm   ya that can work   you you can only make a certain amount of money   mhh hmm  so that's not the answer  you know if you wanna want to   make money  no   no no  you know i guess that depends what you want  but it is nice to make money if you're working   well it helps doesn't it   ya you know especially if you go to school  until you're  thirty years old like i am  i mean it makes life easier   well exactly   ya laugh thirty  forty laugh   shhh  ya not too loud   i let them think that i'm thirty   oh i know   okay  there you go  but no i know what you mean  i i was thinking about that too  i mean i've been going to school and doing a lot of different kinds of things with my life  so ya you don't have that much time to start you know saving up some money and uh you know working on your pension plan and all that kind of thing  ya   ya  which is also part of life eh  you have to think about those things too  in in uh like in our adult education course i was thinking of we i was  speaking to this other girl that i'm doing it with  i said she said maybe we should do our presentation on the changing trends in adult education  mhh hmm   uh huh   so i said ya and then i said maybe  we should we could say that many well not that many years ago adults didn't go back to school to change careers  mhh hmm   you just didn't go back to school when you were forty  and decide you're going to become a dentist  that's right   that's right   mhh hmm  like it was unheard of and unacceptable  ya  right  that's right  and now people even the universities   wouldn't accept you  if you applied to mcgill montreal university at forty years old and say you know i want to enter the school of medicine they'd laugh you out of ah uh out of the place
