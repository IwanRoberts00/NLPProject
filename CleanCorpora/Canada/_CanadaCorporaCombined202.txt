 uh so teachers at our high s  school teachers have three weeks   to to move the students around  uh what we decided this year was to take a writing sample and if students said uhh this course is too hard for me to look at the writing sample and say oh yes you're right or oh no sorry you're just trying to get an easy credit so you're going to stay where you are  so so there we  can move them around  and the ministry has put out a i guess a  call for tenders uhh through a program called word  uh which is for research uhh and they have called for tenders to create a new placement tool uhh that will reflect the new programs  uhh to test this use in maybe half of the new cegeps at the moment called tecas teste three words seconde  uhh was put together in nineteen seventy-four with the understanding that the ministry would give us money and we would revamp it and continue it and follow it up and make changes  however uh there has never been any more money and it's in the state it was in nineteen seventy- six i guess  word around there  so it's being used  uhh it's not the best tool  it does uhh discriminate reasonably well  some cegeps have added added bits and pieces to try and make it a little more uhh what precise i guess  we're looking at adding some sort of cloze test and then taking the borderline students say we cut from one level ah at fifty-nine well if they got fifty-five to sixty-five let's look at their cloze test and see  if if in fact they should be on which side of the line they should fall   but again there is no provincial standard  uh evaluation belongs to the each  individual cegep  so the ministry cannot in a sense impose a provincial placement test unless the f&eacute;d&eacute;ration des cegeps  which is made up of all the directeurs directeuses des &eacute;tudes says to the ministry would you please make us a provincial test  no cegep has to use what exists  they can decide we have our own way and this is the right way and  that's what we're gonna going to do  so so they are stream  streamlining those ya and there's a certain amount of   of freedom moving them around  uh for example if students test at this level and they go off somewhere for six weeks and th or they  take a job in toronto for the summer uhh they can come back and redo the test or say to the teacher hey i'm i'm better than i used to be or was tested   okay   uh what's unfortunately confusing also is that uh so this is the highest level uhh students do literature  uh they have to read three literary genres  uhh novels the other ahh a novel a play a short story   there is a fourth one clarification by audience   uhh they had to do do some of those  so it's quite advanced  the problem is that the old numbering system also had a one oh three and it was always the lowest level  so uh if you're the transition  has not been that easy  okay  uh another i think that happens with the new courses is the old courses were built on a vertical scale so that way at the bottom there actually was a one oh one one oh two but it was sorta sort of for people that almost didn't know the alphabet uhh and  certainly door squeaks in certain cases  in montreal they didn't give it for for immigrant classes who use a different alphabet  and that was  that's fine door squeaks   uh otherwise most cegeps start out at the very lowest thing with  sorta sort of like you know what's your name   tuesday  uh no sorry it's not tuesday today  what's your name   that was the one oh three and then it went up one oh four three oh one three oh two  there were some odd courses in here  and then nine oh one  and students would progress up the scale from one course to another course  if they had three courses to do or if they chose two or three if they passed this they did the next one if they passed this they did the next one that sort of thing okay with one oh three being the lowest level  what's what has happened with the reform is that students no longer uh it's not a vertical move the way it used to be   uh students are come in at a level and they progress and move across to this cours propre   so if they come in at one oh four they do that course and then they move on to a course that is in some way adapted to a group of programs  okay  it's not that they do this course and then this course and then this course   okay  so if they do a course in this block a the cours de formation commune then they move across  and i can't even give you a code over here  uh why don't we just call it block b and call it b zero  which is a bit insulting but you know  i'm sorry you're a zero  uh the reason it happened is cos once the b one two and three levels were established and you create something below it well what else can you call it except zero  these poor people got dubbed minus zero at one point  but  laugh   anyhow so the students move from here to there  only in exceptional cases and programs where they have several courses will they actually perhaps go from here to here and then across   most of the students do cours word   across cours propre   okay question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker   uh the ministry realized that they have spent a lot of money on a few of these copies and got criticized so then they started photocopying  uhm what was done for the first the block a courses uhh the courses were the ministry wanted courses developed uhh along the lines of competency-based education uhh where you decide okay the students are to reach this competency  these are the various parts of it  this is how we will judge whether they have reached that competency and this is what they will do to get there  okay   uhh i see a couple nodding  that's nice because not everybody thinks it's so nice and nods   uh so the ministry came up with what's called uh  une word de la comp&eacute;tence   okay so for example uh i'm looking at the ensemble un  the one oh one level here and it says communiquer en anglais avec des certains exemples   so what does that mean  right  so then it's broken down into four elements uh of the competency and it goes essentially through the four skills  and it's one is  d&eacute;gag&eacute; l'essence du message oral a few words  deux minutes   uh two is d&eacute;gag&eacute; l'essence d'une texte  word g&eacute;n&eacute;rale a few words  cent sept cinq sept cent cinquante mots    three is s'exprimer oralement   and four is r&eacute;diger une texte   again reasonably vague but those are the different parts of the competency that will be able to tell us what can this student do with a certain amount of ease  then there was standards that are set and under the standards they're called word la performance   okay  so comp&eacute;tence broken down into  id&eacute;alement de la comp&eacute;tence and then to decide whether they've been reached or not they're word  du performance   and under that there are certain standards being able to recognize this being able to write a certain length uh with a certain amount of precision as to grammar structure verb forms et cetera uh being able to speak on a certain type of topic for a length of time that sort of thing  uh and the what unfortunately   cau caused created  a lot of problems the last column here is called activit&eacute; d'apprentissage and it became a catch-all  what didn't fit into objectives or standards it was sort of oh we'll stick it in the last column and so the column got stuck with a lot of very strange things that that have frustrated people a lot uh in the classroom  it's sort of well what wha how  come you've got four verb tenses mentioned  what's how is that an   ac activity a learning activity   well it's not a learning activity but it had to go in the third column  sorry  uhm so anyhow that's that's that's   what we have  so in this in the  activit&eacute;s d'apprentissage there are in fact indications as to for this level what would be appropriate uhh for form focus or structure or grammar or call it what you will that would be appropriate to  quote unquote master be able to use at that level  okay  it has sent some people at the secondary level into uhm  major curtain-climbing activities uhm because it's sort of a lot a lot you're teaching grammar and that's all  uh which is not really the case but anyhow we'll work at it  uh so the ministry has come up with that  what how you decide to  for example it says role-play  the whatever roles you decide you want to have the students do and all the rest of it is up to the teacher to decide  if you decide uh at a at advanced  level gee there's a really good role play would be to have uhh the guys buy playboy and the girls buy playgirl and look through it and have a discussion on you know what the media does with peoples' bodies  uh that would work  uh you cou could   at the cegep level there the ministry does not dictate these books are acceptable these are not acceptable as they do at the secondary and primary level  so it's really essentially wide open  you whatever books videos  whatever you can get your hands on whatever you create yourself if that's how you feel you can move your students to what they're supposed to do then uhh that's that's fine question/answer exchange between a and extra-corpus speaker   the teacher has the freedom to choose the textbook he or she wants to work with and cegeps  again it depends from cegep to cegep   cegeps have a certain amount of a budget to to  buy teaching resources  okay  uhh flash cards or i videos or textbooks or uh cassettes whatever  uh i'm not sure how many volumes we have but we have a couple of hundred volumes in our department that teachers can use for additional activities  okay  so you can choose the textbook you want or a group of teachers doing a course says get together and teachers decide  of these five books uh this new book that came out by so and so is a really great book and so we're going to use it  uhh and that's the book they use and then supplement with whatever you want question/answer exchange between a and extra-corpus speaker   students have to buy their students are supposed to buy the books at the co-op   at the every cegep has a student co-op  and so in june our teachers phone the co-op and say okay we want seven hundred copies of this and three hundred of that and it's there and students buy them   you could always have them buy stuff off- campus  in in montreal it will probably work reasonably well  in quebec city it doesn't too well  but you can't one thing is you can't  sell books to your students  that's that's actually against the law in cegeps  uhm so so there's that  that opening is there  or if you've decided there are no books that are half as good as what i could do and you want to do your own materials through the whole semester that's uh that's a word  too  okay   maybe i'm worried about the block b  i've talked about each cegep can make up their own families  uhh it's it has also been a  so a a problem uh because there's supposed to be some sort of standardization with the new courses uhh but the ministry has has left  several doors open and that's one of them  for the block b there are two things  a the learning activities column is blank  okay  each cegep uh can write out its own learning activities for the block b courses the cours propre the sort of specific purpose ones  uhm so what most cegeps are doing is the administration is saying okay english department or language department come up with some learning activities  and they get presented and explained and then uhh they're accepted
