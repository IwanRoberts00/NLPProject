 no we can't start tomorrow laugh   laugh   laugh   uh i think the victoria day weekend would be the time   to start   is that multiple words   but i'll have everything already done there  i think we could probably get from here to about here  done on monday but  i'm thinking two or three words   laugh   you're such a good boy   oh that's great   that's fantastic   oh  thank you that's wonderful  because it's straight you know it's  and uh if uh if we are getting that nail gun   well uhm   yeah   well he said that he was gonna   going to lend it to me so uh   two or three words really quickly  yeah  so we can just use that for all the nailing  yeah  and you just go bang bang  bang bang bang  yeah   just like a stapler  yeah  oh boy  yeah  two or three words   like do you watch those uh home improvement things on uh p b s uh television station  yeah  yeah i do from time to time  they put up a whole building in a weekend you know   with those power tools   yeah mm hmm yeah   yes yeah  it's fun watching those  i like watching that programme   so let's   yeah   long audible breath anyway okay  so uh   have   so have you found any pricing on the wood aside from calling dan   no i accepted his word implicitly laugh   ah   i see  sentence   well he's got yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i just  but i imagine that that's sort of you know i don't think that's probably unreasonable  mm hmm  cos he's pretty good within uh   you know cos he's i mean sort of a while since he's done much construction really but he's you know he's pretty good with you know prices and stuff and he seems to   yeah   okay  so   no actually it's true i haven't even  now when you when you get the wood you should specify that you want you don't want  warped wood  okay   you want uh ah nice uh seasoned wood  that uh is not twisted into all kinds of funny shapes   okay cos uhm   that's right cos i'm gonna going to  order it over the phone am i   mm hmm that's right  mmmm   and then whatever finishing pieces we need like mouldings and so on we can probably get at rona hardware store   mm hmm  actually you know what i found downstairs was a piece of baseboard   oh is that baseboard  yeah  i think i've seen that down there  yeah  i don't think we're going to put baseboard a few words   yeah word   i don't think so laugh   laugh   but i thought if we got more i'd   maybe i'd prop it up there against the wall anyway just for old  time's sake   for effect laugh   yeah   well we could put it on  word we don't have to put in on the uh   yeah  yeah i just wanna want to get the wall up and then they get their  privacy and they can have their privacy and they can bring whoever they want in and then i don't have to worry about  them   mm mm hmm   mm hmm   yeah that's right  who's going in there   so uhm so do i have to worry about uh cos there's uhm stuff like you know it's  it's gonna going to have to be built in a little bit right because of the way the uh  the pipes and stuff  oh those pipes   do i have to make word  what's it called a shammy or something  well maybe   is that what it's called  is that the word for that   uhhh a shem or   word   shim   laugh   no a shem is more like just a  thin uh wedge  mm hmm   ah whatever  yeah we should get something to put on the uh  along that beam   ah so ah i guess some more two by four that length   oh the two by four  yeah word word  onto the beam  okay then   and then word put it onto that yeah   oh i see yes okay   alright   that's a good idea  okay so that means that uh we've got fifteen of them here right now  and   okay so   a hundred and twenty one divided by  cos you said that they're about eight feet   they're about eight feet long so eight feet is uh ninety-six inches so you need two more  okay two more  ya   just here  ya  this is the only place right  yeah   it's not gonna going to   be a problem there and it's not gonna going to   be a problem there  i don't think so  okay so seventeen   seventeen two by four equals word    mm hmm   word   what about nails and stuff like that  don't word   nails   yeah you probably want uh uh two inch   oh no we we need some three inch because we're using two by fours along the bottom   uh three inch that bend  you'd better check that dan 's gun will take uh  three inch nails   okay   okay  and you want them that they'll go into cement through wood into cement   and then the rest can probably be two inch nails  okay and they won't have to go through wood into cement  no they're going through wood into wood  mm hmm   and do you still have that wood glue  do you want to do you want to glue the wood as well as nailing it the plywood  just all around this railing down here but uh   do i want to nail the uh glue it on as well as  would that make it would  that make it airtight   as well as nailing it   that will make it stronger   yeah probably  yeah okay   so maybe i should i should   i guess i had some wood glue but i don't suppose that there'd be enough  it doesn't   like that yellow bottle of glue hey   yeah   yeah something like that maybe bigger  cos you just want to put a bead  of glue around and uh  yeah   yeah   yeah   okay yeah  okay   so uh what about uh  it's going to be two inch two inch  plywood right  two by four   half inch   oh half inch plywood   half inch plywood yeah   ya   okay   and uh what about what are we   gonna going to use to seal the uhm the seams  well uhm what i thought we'd do was to put the uprights where the seams are so the big pieces of  wood get nailed to the  uh to the   uprights   yeah   word   right   right  and that'll make it airtight too won't it   ya   yeah   ya   and then uhm ah if you want to if you feel strongly about it they do have kind of flat moulding that you can get to cover the seams  okay   well i just want to make sure it's airtight  mm hmm  and they'll be nailed to the beams on this side won't they  the beams will be behind it  well it it depends   not not necessarily  if you want the possibility of putting up  shelves on the  side   so   so it would be a good idea to keep the beams on this side so that i could actually use it as support for the  shelves   yeah   mm hmm mm hmm   okay  and then the uprights as well you can use   word   yeah   well if i if i'm  making if i'm putting moulding on there it's for the people on the other side  did you   so they're not putting moulding on   obviously   a few words   a few words   it will be airtight though  that's what i'm concerned   but why does it have to be i mean why can't it be open here  word i'd like it   yeah but this is where the garage door is you know   where all the you know  oh right   yeah but i mean it's gonna going to  air moves it's gonna going to  get around  laugh uh well what is there any way   i spose suppose that would be really difficult to do would it  to put in a door  yeah  i don't think that's a good idea there cos then we'd have to extend that wall to the front  but i would like to eventually wall that off you know  is that is that a big   that can be next year's project  laugh   laugh   well maybe dan could help me finish off that part if he uh cos that's a little bit more  complicated to make a door and  stuff   mm hmm mm hmm   yeah it is   to make a door   uh huh   and he could maybe do that  and uh i mean the wall would have to go up  onto that piece of uh you know onto the cement  back there   the cement there   cos if it went down there it would just rot  yeah  yeah  well that wouldn't be too hard to do  i mean that's fairly simple cutting compared to what we're going to do around the stairs   yeah   sentence laugh   laugh   mm mm  uh yes laugh   laugh   but for now let's let's  concentrate on what we have   let's at least get this done yeah  yeah   well okay  well let's see now what else do i have to remember to ask for   they're gonna going to deliver all this stuff aren't they  yeah  yeah  that's right  yeah you should probably have them deliver it to the  garage so that we can just take it right down  to the basement  uh huh   yeah   i remember what i was gonna going to  what i was gonna going to   ask about cos  remember i told you that over here floods  sometimes  yeah   yeah  and i'm concerned about uh   what it is this is where the other uh cement uh shed you  know   things are and this is where the flooding is and it mostly stays along this side but  mm hmm   mm hmm   oh that's right  get some sealer some wood sealer  some wood sealer   yeah  c e l e r laugh   wood sealer laugh   s e a l e r   i like my spelling better  it's more creative  it is isn't it laugh   it's uh more along the line of uhm esperanto isn't it  i don't know  i don't know es   i thought esperanto was more based on spanish  oh i don't know  neither do i  laugh   anyway okay so wood sealer and a nail gun and   word   so my goodness two words   now now ask  dan about the nail gun because he may have to get shells for it  shells  yeah it uses shells  oh   or cartridges or whatever they're called  hmm   it fires the nails into the   hmm   that's why they go into the cement   okay so i'll have to check with you then  to see how thing works  yeah   now we had some renovations done at the office last year as you know  mm hmm  and uh when they put up the walls they used a nail gun    mm hmm  and afterwards we found all these shell casings all over the place and   it was a bit worrying till we realized what they had come   from   laugh   gosh i wonder if that's a few words thinking   i don't know   but it saves so much time   time   yeah  and it's really been in like it'd be in  solid wall right  well yeah  yeah  cos i'm not driving those nails into the cement with a hammer  no  no  how would they do it otherwise without a   without a nail gun what would they do   hmm  two or three words lean it up against a  well uhm   they'd have to find another way of attaching the  the base to the uh floor  word   that'll certainly make it a lot easier  mm hmm  it's a good thing that i found it  mm hmm  yeah  ask him too just in case uh ask him if he has a chalk line  okay   loud breath out i know he has all kinds of stuff and then  you know   yeah  but uh tucked away in his basement or something  cos he doesn't do this kind of stuff very much  anymore   mm hmm   yeah   well and this uh chalk line would be handy cos then  you could put a couple of marks on the  floor so you have the chalk line to   word   yeah   yeah   yeah   yeah i know  all done  then you have a nice straight line  yeah  yeah  hmm   well i'm very excited about this  yeah you want to start tonight  yes i do   laugh   i wanna want to go right down there and start working with those two two by fours that i've got there cos uh   are these gonna going to fit here  oh that totally will  no  laugh oh no two or three words  no  oh     oh well  besides it's kinda kind of  late at night to start hammering things into the main beams that  support the house laugh   word i know it is  yeah right  laugh
