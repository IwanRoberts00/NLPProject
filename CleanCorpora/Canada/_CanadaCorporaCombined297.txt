 so cough this is the first letter and it's called for the benefits of a poster the discovery of deserts giants and sewers  my dear friend   a writerly greeting with a text by the late algernon sidney  very late actually  somewhere uh before uh sixteen eighty-three  his plotting discourses on government is has   one bit of ambiguous advice for people in our profession and it is this  liars out to have good memories   it has always made me happy to know that if you and i had not been writers we would never have met  but since we are both we did meet and in that way we were mutually responsible for at least the possible beginning of our friendship   the contemporary world places a most disproportionate emphasis on individual freedom  we call self-determination a right with a general understanding it is worth dying for even though everyone knows how much of our life is quite beyond our determination word our control  the time and country of one's birth one's parents one's genetic programming the food one is fed the very size of one's toes or nose or cock or breasts any of these and or a thousand other personal details can be critical traumatic of life importance and every one is quite beyond our self determination  the fact that i have a certain type of red colour blindness could presumably at some point kill me though it hasn't yet and nevertheless it has certainly prevented me from becoming the airplane pilot or painter i sometimes as a child dreamed about  while at the same time it grants me the freedom to walk about sometimes quite unselfconsciously in clothes of embarrassing colour combinations as close friends tell me  this uncontrollable genetic inheritance apparently granted me by my mother who herself had a superb eye for colour may very well be the reason why since the age of six i have found it necessary to inflict upon myself the essential suffering of chewing my fingernails   if laugh human beings have developed towards any kind of freedom beyond the other animals it is surely because of their developed ability to think in image and abstraction  the saskatchewan homestead where i was born had more animal than human companionship to offer  the behaviour of cows when i had to herd them in the unfenced bush was highly instructive to me  cows wanted some simple things  they wanted to eat grass to drink water to protect and nurse their calves to lie about and chew their cud and at various times they   to mount and be mounted by another cow  now this latter process seemed to be the only fun they ever had  it could continue for an entire day  such a cowish expression of intimate bodily concern for one another  never evident between them otherwise  one after another they hoisted themselves ponderously up on their back legs and leaped before they missed which as they sometimes did to clasp the afflicted or playful one again and again offering their clumsy mysterious solicitude  the arrival of any scrawny bull however instantly changed all that into domineering into a great deal of roaring of bellowing okay okay i'm here just get out of the road i'll take care of it shoving everyone aside and simply doing the same thing in his massive pointed way violent and fast  and that finished the fun and the caring  after they all stood around a bit as uh as   it seems in sort of growing discouragement each cow went back to her solitary boring normality of tearing up grass  it happened often enough but the cows never seemed to anticipate  that the bull would spoil their cowish delight enjoy it then chase   em them away  they outnumbered him twenty to one before he would do it   truly stupid these cows  they never remembered anything  all they seemed to know was that was  immediately under their broad wet noses  they never seemed to have thought like there should be grass here for example or we should keep this bull away or he'll finish our fun and games  never  on the other hand my mother and i talked of all sorts of possibilities that hadn't even happened yet  my mother might say that bull must have been lawrence's  scrub broken out of his fence again  if he let that scrubby beast run around following its nose  lawrence will have every farmer mad at him again from here to  estevan just like last year   and i'd respond hopefully maybe somebody'll load up his gun or rifle or something and shoot it   our house never had a rifle in it   even when our neighbours came by hunting in fall as they often did their heavy rifles stayed in the their wagon or their saddles or at worse tilted against the wall in the step outside the door  my mother would not so much as talk about guns especially  wilful ones  of course my subsequent ignorance of guns transformed them into a fascinating mystery which is why i mentioned of it every  word chance i had at whatever length i could spin out  my mother would shake her head stop talking like that nobody will shoot anything and change the subject  does nellie still hide in the bush so much  she doesn't want to come home  maybe we should hang this small bell on her   thinking into these matters now it seems to me that  subliminally i already knew at the age of seven or eight about the time when i began milking and discovered at the tips of my fingers the refined continuous possibility of pain if one seriously chewed one's nails i  uh squeezing tough bush tips taut with milk can build up excruciating levels  i knew that the human ability to think to image was inextricably linked to our ability to our ability to speak  the language of my mother and myself was somehow our mutually agreed upon sound image of the observably factual world   in an instant we could create the world in sound unhindered by place or by time past present future simply offer more possibilities without any of the world having to be actually physically present  what an incredible gift language   with a puff of air you could conjure up nellie surely the stupidest of brown cows without dragging that huge and invariably spring green grass shit-slimed lump of bovinity into the house with you   what power of dealing with the world   words what incredible freedom   years later i recognized that the hebrew myth of human creation underscored this same concept  perhaps i had heard the strange story of eve and adam mutilated too often from too many pulpits to notice this understanding about language earlier  in genesis chapter two adam is alone in eden and in the process of naming the animals that is inventing human language and he discovers that none of them are fit for him  somehow language itself the names he gives the animals and he is free to gi give call  them anything he wishes reveals to him their distinct animal natures  these creatures are different from me  they are not my fit companions   now when he complains to yahweh about this yahweh puts him to sleep and makes eve out of adam's rib   now by an inexplicable linguistic accident the english words  man and woman mirror the image the hebrew pun on the two words used in the original story a pun which in turn presumably mirrors the physical pun of yahweh's playing on adam as it were a linguistic echo of that duplication with a significant difference  i first noticed this curiosity because the pun doesn't work in german  mann und weib share neither sound nor sense nor even a single letter   but luther in his translation thought this word play so crucial that he invented a word by force using man  mann and then attaching a feminine ending to it   having to change the a to a umlaut  m&auml;nnin he called it to put the pun across  the germans are much too logical for such oxymorons as  mann and m&auml;nnin and the word exists only in luther's bible laugh at genesis chapter two verse twenty-three  you can look it up   as an aside that particular genesis story of human creation  there is an earlier one in chapter one  has always struck me as ambiguously problematic  the language pun is essential to the story because it seems yahweh is playing a joke on adam  adam wants a companion and help be fit and proper for himself  well yahweh makes him one out of himself  adam laughs because of course he gets the joke and names eve accordingly  he's been practicing naming creatures after all  me man  you woman   but it seems yahweh has the last laugh  in the very next chapter this special arrangement of a health mate would be so incredibly helpful to get them both kicked out of paradise  wow that's a helpful companionship alright  it's a big cosmic joke i'd say  in my less hilarious moments i find the native canadian yellowknife story of human creation first recorded in english in an eighteen thirty-six much more helpful and i intend the pun  uh that yellowknife story also begins with a solitary man but it centres on his living with a ptarmigan  that is an animal which in hebrew terms is prohibitively different from man  and then making and the two of them making  a pair of snowshoes   man ptarmigan and snowshoes it's a superb story  you should look that one up too   you can read it in braying head if you want to   well in beginning with speech it followed that in learning how to read i was making the next step into image and abstraction that of physically seeing of physically seeing a commonly agreed upon symbol of the sound which in turn was the image of the factuality of the world alright  i experienced all around me  and obviously that concept would work itself back into a different direction as well  if it comes from the factuality of the world it can also work itself back in a different way   i could see also see the symbol of the sound which was the image of a world i might never yet have seen but which existed somewhere either in actuality or in the imagination of the maker of the symbols   i will return to discuss this latter point  for the moment let me say that i devoured the miracle of language written of book  in nineteen seventy-one a former teacher told me that by the time i finished grade two that is june nineteen forty-three i had read every book in the treadwell saskatchewan school district library  now granted the entire district consisted of a one room one log school laugh with four shelves of very worn books some in classroom sets and a small cupboard with doors that stood directly below the window high on the east wall  i still remember the tiny knobs on the library cupboard doors  they were the first machined knobs i had ever seen  they were so absently round and smooth with a screw in their centre  the school door itself had a metal knob you had to turn to open  on our farm you opened things from outside by pulling on leather loops nailed onto them or from inside by jerking a string that lifted the outside latches  in nineteen seventy-one my former teacher whom i had not met since nineteen forty-three told me about my early reading as we leaned out of the big hole of where the school's large west windows used to be the ones overlooking the hallowed space where the ball diamond had been the sod-covered barn where we used to stable our horses for the day and the hill  where we slid on our sleds and skis all winter and wrestled each in the snow when we as we always did spilled  the log shell of the school still existed twenty-one years ago  its high roof still kept out most of the rain
