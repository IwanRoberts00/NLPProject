 well it sounds like your brother upfront  laugh   uhm  but but that that   sense of control that you had in producing yourself felt good in the in the final product  or or would you rather not do it again   well i've always   i've always pretty well you know produced myself   with with my brother helping me  yeah   but i i really relied upon uh some other people uhm to help me through it  uh i hired a vocal coach to help me through some of the vocals  harry mccormack and uh  like i said my brother joe was with me when i did a lot of the overdubs uh  i relied a lot on the musicians you know to uh  to be playing certain things and for me to be able to catch them in moments  hmm  so it wasn't like i was there alone with a midi machine and a computer  yeah  trying to do it all myself  uhm hmm  tell me about the vocal coach  that that inter  interests me because phrasing is crucial in this genre of singing   it is   it is  it's  what i found out  what i was   people call sinatra a genius well   that's right  that's right and you know it's your timing and how much you sing or don't sing is very crucial to songs as such  and harry mccormack was uh  i had a couple of problems with some songs uhm to get through them  cos i wasn't sure where to inflect my voice  i i was seeming to over blow it  i used too much voice too much passion to the point where i was just killing it  and then i'd go back the other way and it was too flaccid  so he he really got me through it  word   one of them was i die a little more each day  it was a very difficult song to sing because of the content of the lyric  each line  i mean how do you sing the black drums leaking in their graves   remainder of song lyric   it's very difficult to sing that  carried away emotionally if you   yeah you can get  yeah   you know   so you're tending you tend to want to pull back but  he came up with a lot of good uhm good hints  he told me every line has to have its own colour  because the melody is somewhat repetitive and the things that's really changing the colour are the lyrics so you have to go with the lyric  and we just horsed around in the studio and and  uh his his attention to  to detail really paid off  is is it a matter of concentration too  well it's also a matter of paying attention  and a matter of getting in tune with what you're really trying to say  yeah  i wrote die a little more each day two three years ago  and i believe if i would have done a vocal right there i probably would have had it  but after three years i forgot what the   i forgot to tap into that emotion  uhm   i didn't know what it was anymore  and uh i knew this this nice lyric here was written  and it was time to do a vocal  but uh i i couldn't get into the emotion   that immediacy   exactly   yeah   and then and then finally going into it and into it and into it  i remember when i finally got the vocal  i tapped into it and i felt it again  my heart started palpitating and i started feeling like i really feel this pain  and i really do feel that because these things are done to ourselves and to earth and so on and so forth i i  really do feel the ache  hmm  and then the vocal started coming alive  ironically it must be a great feeling though to  capture capture that that  feeling again remembering what it was like laugh   it is   oh yeah it is  yeah  that is the danger sometimes of living with a song for more than a couple of years  tell me about the show coming up at the spectrum  montrealers are going to see a different uh gino vinelli  yeah   now this is exciting  it's the first night of the jazz festival  yeah  well you know i i wouldn't consider myself a a artist  in fact jazz is a very difficult word  to to really define but  it's it's more of what we know as a jazz band  uh i'm only gonna going to be  it's it's gonna going to be different  we're going to we're going to have a trio  we're going to have a a piano player a vibist and a an upright bass  and we'll have various guests from the jazz festival  and it'll be uh  can you tell me who they are yet  well we're we're talking to a   a few of them   and uh they'll they'll be classics  oh okay   i guarantee you that  uh  cos i know joe williams is coming this year  interesting  well it's a question of working out the timing  yeah laugh all right  but uh it'll be a a night  basically where i'm i think i'd like to communicate to people on a different level than i have in the past  on a very personal level  i like em them to sing the   to sing the melodies to show them the melodies without much production at all  and for them to sing along and to and to   see some of the or hear some of the changes i've been through as a person or as someone they've maybe followed for a few years  and to see if it mirrors their lives  and to make it a lot more uhm naked than it's ever been  do you rush to embrace that feeling of the way you're  you're going to be out there on stage   yeah   cos it's a lot different from studio isn't it  it is  but you know i uh  in the last uh couple of months i've actually been with uh a couple of musicians and we've done this over some cities in the united states and it's been a hell of a lot of fun  tell me about uh the tap dancing in uhm in  fallen in love  that's not you obviously  no no it's gregory hines   the great gregory hines   how'd you get him to do that  i just asked him laugh   oh and he said <yeah sure   yeah   yeah  well he wanted to hear the tape  and i said uhm  well what it came about in the studio  and it was it was originally a drum solo  and because we were trying to think of unique ideas uh i said to myself uh  someone mentioned that it reminded them of a fred astaire type track  something you know a modernized thirties or forties song  i said uhm how about a tap solo  i said well who better gregory hines  so i got my manager to call his agent  and uh his agent gave us his his home number  i called him and i said it was me and i said would you like to do a tap solo  and he said send me a tape  i sent him a tape  he called me the next day and said you bet laugh   all right  and so we uh  i went to l a cos he was going to be in l a in a few weeks  from that time  and uh we joe and i built him a  uh a stage  two four by eight plywoods nailed together on two by fours  threw a little sand on it  put a couple of mics microphones and said go gregory laugh   laugh   must have been fun to watch  it was  we had we filmed it  it was fun  well thanks a lot for coming in  welcome home back home and uh  looking forward to seeing you uh at the jazz festival  my pleasure   well for the past few summers montrealers have been strapping on the wheels and taking off to the nearest bike path or park  rollerblading  in-line skating if you like  it's getting more and more popular every year  as you probably heard last week the city of montreal loosened its rules just a little  blades are now allowed on bike paths and in some parks  today we're going to talk about safety etiquette and of course  paramount we're going to talk about fun  ben uh feinstein is a blader  he also owns a store that sells rollerblades and he joins me in the studio now  hi  welcome to the program  thanks  it's also changed the sound of street hockey too  massively yes   yeah irreparably   because my my uh sound of street hockey is the sound of boots or running shoes clapping against the sidewalk  now of course it's the sound of  sound of bearings that need greasing   yeah yeah exactly laugh   all the kids on my block if it's street hockey uh   they are playing they are playing on rollerblades  yeah i'm doing the same thing  i've got a bunch of friends who uh all converted the same way  we play in a local school yard  oh do ya you   yeah   yup   and uh there's the sound of scraping knees too occasionally  and the occasional yelp but that's about it  are shin guards essential  uh not essential  it depends how you're playing  it's the same thing with shinny when you're playing hockey in winter  yeah you're gonna going to get knocked down anyway  yeah  is it is it   i'm sure it's not just me who's noticing this but it seems to be a quantum leap in the number of people roller roller blading  each year  i was out at the old port and my gosh they're everywhere  yup  it's seems like in montreal over the past couple of years it's almost doubled  the the sales year to year have been twice as great as they were the year before  that much eh  so yeah even last summer you're looking at a thirty percent increase in the number of people on the streets who are blading and they're anticipating the same thing if not more for this summer so  holy mackerel  yeah  and how qui what are the age groups    i mean uh i'm i'm seeing uh uh uh  actually i'm seeing all ages  yeah  is there an age group where it's it's   most popular  well our store tends to uh focus on the freestyle aspect  we've got a lot of teenagers who come into our store for snowboards and stuff  uhm hmm  and our focus uh actually has gone a lot broader because the sport hits everyone  i've got my daughter on blades myself and   how old is she   she's uh four years old and i   how do you get blades that small   can you  they've got em them they got   em them   they come with two sizes uh two size booties for the insides  they'll last longer stuff like that  and my father actually is the person i've longest known to be a blader or uh in-line skater and he's been doing it for at least fifteen years now  something like that   really   he bought his blades way back in the seventies  seventy-eight seventy-nine   well i'm not gonna going to be    that is a long he's a real pioneer isn't he    i'm not gonna going to be indelicate and ask how old he is but uh needless to say uh he's not a kid   he's a he's a   sex sexagenarian or something like that  i don't know what laugh   he's been around for a few decades  yeah  what does he love so much about it  uh i think he likes the exercise the smoothness of it the less impact uh related problems the knees and back than running   than running yeah uhm hmm   and you go faster  it's just the thrill of a little bit of speed without you know  unlike a bike you don't need miles and miles to go  a couple of miles and you get a good workout but you get the sensation of going a little bit faster than you are with your when you're walking  yeah   and the whole feeling really the essence of it that   i it struck me last summer was the idea of being able to  imagine this is like to me a quebec dream  the streets freeze but it's warm and you can use your skates all summer long and go anywhere and  so they are they really are a natural extension of us  oh yeah   aren't they yeah
