 and even though cana canadian uh  canadians often seem to mimic americans' tendencies  canada has not yet caught up with what is recognized as an american inclination to sue   and i really don't know the law at all so i don't know even if it's more difficult to sue here or in the rest of canada  but of course every generalization i make about canada would be modified by something else about quebec  because quebec has a different in many ways a different legal system it has its own tax system et cetera et cetera right  in terms of uh how many people might be around to help you there are in fact not that many people trained  in montreal the percentage of people trained  wi within the population is not quite one percent  one of the best areas i think is the gasp&eacute;   and i have the impression that there there is a lot of training that there's a lot a a a a serious spirit of training with uh c p r instructors in the gasp&eacute;  so there are areas in quebec  the highest percentage in quebec of people trained to do c p r  is two and i think that's in the gasp&eacute;  the lowest is quiet muttering with an extracorpus speaker, unintelligible tape stops and starts again   and so in montreal it isn't even one percent  or it's just scuse me excuse me   no i'm sorry in the eastern townships it isn't even one percent  in montreal it's just over one percent  so it's very important that you have the remotest clue about what to do  another statistic that should compel you or motivate you is that  in virtually eighty percent or eight times out of ten that you are in a position to respond to an emergency you will know the victim  so it will be in your home at your workplace in your backyard  and this is something to consider if you're worried about responding because of communicable diseases like hepatitis or aids  if you compare hepatitis to aids hepatitis is highly contagious  and not as lethal as aids  and of course there are at least a coup a couple of kinds of hepatitis  aids on the other hand is hardly contagious   com as as communicable diseases go aids is very noncontagious but it's very lethal   so whether you're trying to protect yourself from a cold or hepatitis or anything else if you are taking this seriously it's very easy to acquire a pocket mask  and every area that has a responder in the university is supposed to have a pocket mask  if you have any questions about equipment then you should call the safety office and talk to natasha   but for your own self too you can check around and get pocket masks for your own first aid kit  i have one in my car  makes a comment   that's right  there are different kinds you can get there are many many barriers  the manufacturers in recent years have made a killing on barrier production  whereas a decade ago you would have to look high and   far and wide to find a pocket mask for joe public  now joe public can get all kinds of of  barriers  and there there are little ones that are disposable that just come in a sterile package and you tear them open and what it amounts to is a rectangle of plastic with a little piece of uhm   and in if worse comes to worse and you're there feeling uh vulnerable but still interested in responding  then even if you use some some cloth  any kind of fabric can present pre  present somewhat of a barrier not a complete one by any means  alright  does anyone have any questions  so now that liz has rescued amanda i would like  liz to be a victim and i would like each of you to go through the little torture of recognizing an emergency doing the assessment and  okay going as far as you can  so who's next tape stops and starts again   one one thousand two one thousand et cetera  get comfortable with it right away this response this little scenario is the most important part of the course  i will get a two words in you will do the heimlich manoeuver but this assessment and your coughing in audience starts willingness to overcome coughing in audience ends your own confusion and awkwardness is the most important part of the course  starts to ask a question tape stops and starts again   would have been covered in the first c s s t commission de la sant&eacute; et de la securit&eacute; au travail course that you did  you probably learned to disturb the person as little as possible  stabilize them as much as possible that's for physical injuries   always stop the bleeding first  so even if you see this person collapsed here they may have no uh broken legs or limbs or sprains or strains but if you notice an arterial bleed then of course you have to stop that  does anybody remember anything about stopping bleeding tape stops and starts again   christine   christine or christina   extracorpus speaker responds   i have a niece named christine   if i came along here and christine had a big cut in her arm  she may be unconscious she may be unconscious because she is bleeding or she may be unconscious for other reasons but a serious bleed is one where you can see the bleeding   the blood is appearing  you don't have to nobody has to quantify exactly whether it's a spurting gush or anything like that  a serious bleed is where you can see the blood increasing  and the first thing you have to do is try and stop the bleeding  with pressure and elevation right  if there are two of us that would be great if i could sit here with the arm raised putting pressure on the wound  ideally i would have a bandage under my hand but if not this is  helpful  within a few minutes the bleeding can slow at least  it may never depending on where it's cut it may never be completely stopped without some pressure on it but if you slow the bleeding that will help a lot  and for many many whether it's a small bleed or a big bleed there are physiological things that happen to stop it  they the stuff that clots a bleed  if if if the blood keeps spurting out and washing it away then there's no chance for clotting to occur  so that helps too  pressure slows it down elevation makes it harder for the blood to go up against gravity   so that's if you just so you don't  have to have a first aid kit with you to stop a bleed  and you don't have to memorize a first aid course to do that kind of thing   you have to just think i have to slow or stop the bleeding by putting pressure on the wound and raising the member if it involves a leg or an arm  there are some bleeds you can't raise so then you put pressure  okay   so that's the only that's the only first aid you worry about in this approach in this assessment   and if you see broken bones if you see any kind of other damage  the first assessment involves breathing et cetera   so a f a a first a comprehensive first aid approach always involves a primary and secondary survey which was probably mentioned in your first aid course  so the primary survey is always is this person conscious are they breathing do they have a pulse  the secondary survey is do they have a broken foot do they have a broken arm do they have broken ribs  so if you discovered if you couldn't help but notice that there were broken bones you would have to do the primary survey first  and if you discovered that this person needed c p r you would have to do c p r  asks a question   the consequence  this this brings me into a description of death as it involves sudden death   if someone for whatever reason suddenly becomes unconscious  or suddenly and or suddenly stops breathing and or suddenly has no more pulse when they collapse and are breathless and pulseless this is called sudden death  it means that they weren't sick sicker sickest and finally expired  it means that they suddenly collapsed breathless and pulseless  for a few minutes their status is described as being clinically dead   which means that they're not breathing and they have no pulse  that's what clicincal death means no breath no pulse   if someone intervenes either with basic life support or advanced life support artificial breathing and circulation can be provided  and that will stabilize the situation that they're in  and possibly this person can be reanimated and can recover from sudden death  if the person remains clinically dead for a period of time that is with no breathing and no circulation there will be organ and tissue damage   when the brain is damaged enough the death will be irreversible  and this is biological death  brain death is biological death and this is not reversible  and finally if someone who has the authority to do so checks out the victim and says i declare them legally dead this is usually a doctor  then that is legal death  so of course there are people who are dead who are not legally dead  there have been enough cases of people who were not dead to have been declared legally dead  but the only one that involves you is clinical death   and the only assessment you can make following the a b cs is is this person breathing is their heart beating  and so that's all you have to know   that's all you ever have to know  and anyone can check a pulse and anyone can check breathing  and you can and if you do and discover that the person has no pulse and no breath  unless its cause could hurt you too it doesn't matter why they collapsed or how and it doesn't matter how long they've been collapsed as long as you can do the assessment and try to respond   and there's more than just a physical inability to respond that can impede you sometimes  it could be an emotional a mental other type of physical inability exhaustion or something  if ever you're in a position where you are alone to respond  such as with the the the people who sleep on park benches and on a regular basis need attention you just have to do your best  and if your best doesn't involve checking and rubbing his airway then your best should involve calling for help  you know you in the end have to be the person who decides what to do   d'ya did you have a good rest here  laughs with audience   are you ready to rescue somebody tape stops and starts again  walked up to them going no no word  unconscious  to see how clearly people breathe  so trust that  another thing is that if you breathe for someone they won't uh if they don't need your mouth to mouth it won't hurt them  of course if you do c p r and they don't need it it will hurt them  don't worry about giving someone mouth to mouth if you're not a hundred percent sure that they need it  you just have to make sure that you can find a pulse or not and that's why you should try as much as possible to find everybody's pulse here  has anyone not checked everyone answers at once   they didn't do it okay that's it <$ze makes a comment   you haven't  kay okay victim rescuer come on  what a challenge tape stops and starts again   it's a good idea to give just enough air to see the chest rise and not more <$zf asks a question tape stops and starts again  in the initial assessment it has to be very stepwise  tilt the airway check the breathing  if there's no breathing start mouth to mouth with two breaths   once you do get the two breaths in check the pulse  show me how you would do that  asks a question   it is recommended that you check it on your side to avoid pressing down on the windpipe and both carotid arteries
