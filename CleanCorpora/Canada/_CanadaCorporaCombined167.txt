 uhh the answer would be no  uh there are other medications which are far superior to that  and as a general rule that medication is not used for anger  it's not used for anxiety  if i were to use something similar to that medication i might use imipramine and so would most other psychiatrists   are you saying that that medication does not have the effect of controlling those types of symptoms  it has a poor effect and if you're using it for that effect uh you probably maybe two words consider switching your agent   does it have the effect of controlling those symptoms doctor  uh by putting someone to sleep yes  so you're suggesting this particular medication for treatments   two or three words   actually elavil when it comes to the anti-depressants is  the most the word anti-depressant on the market and it used to be the gold standard when it first came out  i don't know when that was  nineteen fifty nineteen sixty  uh but most psychiatrists with recent training avoid elavil like the plague  so you disagree with the indication in the c p s possibly canadian pharmacists association that that medication can be  be prescribed for uh depressive patients suffering from marked agitation and tension to help reduce those two symptoms  that is anxiety or aggressiveness or agitation   right  well we're talking about their anxiety and agitation associated with ah major depression in which case i would concur you  would uh may treat the patient for the depression with this kind of medication and it is helpful with an associated anxiety and agitation  so you agree with me then that it can be prescribed to deal with those types of symptoms  is that correct  as a combined package where you have the depression  anxiety and the agitation altogether yes  i take it you are not in any position to comment on the uh  legitimacy of the assessment made by the psychiatrists in february nineteen ninety-five because you have not read the file about that  i believe that would be the case  and you have no reason then to quarrel with their assessment that there was no major depression at that time  i don't know if i'm saying that there was no reason  it seems there are a number of clinical indicators that suggest major depression was a possibility uh but i wasn't there and i haven't reviewed the records so i couldn't really say  but i i can hypothesize and speculate but i can't say definitively that yes he was depressed cos i saw that he was depressed  but everything you've seen would indicate that the indication was he was not depressed  he's had an adjustment disorder with depressive mood which is a different  if i could stand to correct yourself  i believe earlier on i'd stated uh that i think what happened was he developed a major depression in approximately november or early december which was subsequently treated with an anti-depressant for depression reason and uh this uh later resulted in partial resolution of the major depression which would present as an adjustment disorder with depressive mood  subsequent to further treatment uh the major depression resolved completely  can you show me medical records to support that hypothesis  i have indicated i don't have ac  haven't had access to the r t d   so that's purely your hypothesis on your part unsupported by any medical documentation  it would be a clinical uhh opinion  nevertheless whether we call it a hypothesis or opinion it's currently unsupported by any documentation is that correct  as are most of the diagnoses uh that uh psychiatrists do  that's correct  well why wouldn't you go and look at that r t d  file to see exactly what other psychiatrists had said about him and what other assessments had they done on him in the past  uh because i uh live in glengarry and it's a long way to far far away   so you appreciate that your distance and the time you had available did compromise to some extent some of the things you'd like to look at  in regards to the r t d records that's correct  okay   uhm so obviously they there  wasn't all the things done that you might have done in order to prepare your assessment in this case   uhm i think i that would be a valid point  did you read all the letters that were submitted to you  uh i did receive the letters  i did scan through the letters  i cannot say i read every single word but i certainly did scan the bulk of the uh the words in the uh letters that were submitted to me   did you did you not find those letters to be important indicators of mister rabbitfoot 's state of mind at the time they were written  uh could you be more specific  well do not letters  would they not be a good indicator of what the person was thinking or feeling at the time they were written  uh they can be yes   did you find anything in the letters which would help you  uh decide whether or not mister rabbitfoot understood his motivation for the attack upon maria   i can't i can't say i found any specific uh uhm items that clearly indicated he was fully cognizant of what he was doing and that i couldn't and that couldn't  have been uh a result of word being informed of subsequent to the event   as i said i didn't read every single word  there may be a phrase or two in there that i did uh fail to see  did you accept mister rabbitfoot 's claim to having global amnesia   accept it   mhh it's possible   uhh  i i realize it's possible  according to you do you accept him do you accept do you accept his word when he told that to you  well it's fa it's fairly   likely   uh put it that way  he did did consume uh a significant quan quantity  apparently a significant quantity of alcohol and apparently uh what appeared to have been halcion uhm so it it's   certainly fairly possible  uh am i absolutely certain one hundred percent no obviously not   well i'm asking you if you accept it  nobody can ever be certain of anything i guess  you have to decide whether you're going to accept it at face value or if you're going to be skeptical  i'm asking whether you accept it  yup   certainly  the other information i know is that in violent crimes approximately seventy percent of the perpetrators have uh a degree of amnesia related to the offense so amnesia during an offense uh over the duration of the offense is not unusual so i guess the answer is yes i would accept that as a reasonable explanation  was there anything in the letters that went against that  claim to global amnesia  uhm not not that i recall that  specifically specifically and conclusively would go against but then again as i just said i didn't read every single word  would you not think it would be important to go over those letters carefully to see whether or not there were things there that might contradict mister rab  rabbitfoot what mister rabbitfoot  said to you  i think the letters are important as offering a general theme  uh they're very voluminous and uh very boring as you   uh as you're probably aware  uh the theme seems to continue throughout the whole   whole letter uhm and uh certainly there's an item or two that uh would be of use to myself in arriving at a decision and  two or three words look at that   well was there anything in the letters that you found at all helpful in reaching your decision  the letters seem to indicate to me that he's a  manipl manipulative individual  uhm uh that he's uh getting a little desperate and is quite concerned about his position  uh that he has continued to be in involvement  involved in a relationship with uh caroline ticehouser   uh that there seems to be terms could be mispronunciation of 'tomes'  of endearment towards her  a little overdone  i think that's a manipulative aspect of his personality kicking in there  uhm he's persistent   so let's maybe two words   sorry go ahead  he's persistent over time as well  okay  uhm so essentially you found the letters boring  they're voluminous  you didn't have a whole lot of time so you didn't read them all  i did  i did  i did go through  i scanned them all but i did not read every word   did you find anything in the letters that indicated whether or not mister rabbitfoot had been sexually abused as a child   uhm i can't recall  well that's something you were making note of as being important i take it   that's correct  and in fact you consider that word to be a risk indicator that would go against him being high-risk because he  apparently was not sexually abused as a child  that's correct  and uh you asked mister rabbitfoot about that  i did  what did he say  he said he had not been sexually abused as a child  and you believed him   i have no evidence uhh to suggest otherwise  and so we know in the letters that he did state a number of mistruths so i don't know whether any one particular item can be judged as factual or not  they were all word stated by him  yes long pause, 40 seconds   ya i don't imagine you made any notes or kept track of letters so you wouldn't have i idea  any idea from looking at this letter whether it's one you sort of scanned or whether it's simply one that you know  you you read more carefully or not  ya i don't know how many letters he had  maybe fifty  there was ah like a whole pile wasn't there  ya   there's a whole pile  and you're right  they were pretty painful to have to read  yes they were   but in this uh particular uh case uhm you  if you could read this little portion here  certainly  just just read it to yourself  i don't word   oh okay long pause while reading   just that little   okay yes  did you see the part i've cut out   uh ya  it talked about his mother being raped and then he made me go down on him cos i was just a kid which is why i'm scared of two or three words   okay that would seem to indicate that there might have been some sexual abuse as a child  would you agree   well mister rabbitfoot has a little pattern in those letters of uh professing to be subjected to acts of sexual violence which apparently are not true such as being raped in prison and so i don't know if i can give ah this particular statement any more weight uh in terms of factual content than i would the statement i had been raped in prison  i'll i'll just ask my question again  sure   if you would answer my questions i'd sure appreciate that  you agree with me that that particular phrase would indicate  that he was sexually abused as a child  all that indicates is that he is stating he was sexually abused as a child   he stated to you one time he wasn't sexually abused as a child  in this letter he's stating he is sexually abused as  a child  correct   correct  you have no better knowledge than me as to which one of those is true do you   exactly   and what you did point out that there were other allegations of sexual abuse in these letters referring to what happened to him at the institution  correct  mister rabbitfoot himself admitted to you that those were false  correct  he uh you never got into discussing this particular aspect of the letters because i take it you hadn't noticed that or read that before just now  correct  or if i had read it i have forgotten  well you certainly didn't take it up with him and say what about this part here   no i did not  i'd find it interesting to know whether that's true or not  it would be interesting to know whether it was true  or not   and if it is true then certainly one of the risk factors you say aren't present in fact is present in this case
