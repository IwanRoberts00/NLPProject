 and in this case stephanie colvy is the woman in the middle  and what this does is all of a sudden you get to see the artist  and all too often we see what the artist does but we don't really know what the artist looks like and and often it's nice to be able to look some sort of have some sort of  intimate relationship with the artist just based on the way what they look like and form an opinion based on their face and their the character that they have cos that helps you understand and maybe see aspects of a style or an aesthetic or a a feel that comes out of their work  next we did a blow up of   does anyone know what this is   contact sheet   so it's a blow up of a contact sheet  and what we wanted to do was make sure that people who visited  the the museum who don't really have a close relationship with photography understand how photographs are taken in this sort of uhm style  so the one thing that we notice is that that   these are not posed images  they're not one-offs  they're not constructed images  so what you'll do is you'll end up using a roll of thirty-six  and as you can see in this section from sixteen down to about twenty-seven she's just shooting the same sort of thing over and over again waiting for the sun to change waiting for shadows to change waiting for people to come into and out of the frame  as you see in here just getting whatever she can sort of in  you want to be able to pick up the natural rhythm of a person's day as opposed to jumping in and disrupting them by taking these contrived  images of them  so photographing this way takes a really long time takes a number of hours  often and wi with most of it well all five six photographers were in agreement it would take them at least an hour before they even started to shoot an image  in some cases cough it wa it took uhm cindy andrew seven hours before the women that she was interviewing would let them take photographs of her  so you really have to be interested in your subject  you have to really have uhm patience and a really clear idea of  getting to know the people based on who they are and what they're doing and really taking the time  after that you notice all the photographs are once again in black and white  we do we have one image that's in large format and the other nine are all in the same eleven by fourteen sixteen by twenty   and this is the way the show's curated  now what i'm going to do  do you have any questions about just this portion that i'm showing you right now   okay  what i'm going to do is i'm going to give you uhm an activity sheet  but you don't have to fill this out  it's not like go to each question  it's just when you're looking at the photographs and when you're thinking about making these assessments and you know and putting these relationships together you can use this in some cases just to remember things uhm look at different ways to look at the image  it's more like a guideline more than anything else  but if there's anything that occurs to you about something you can always i mean jot it down something that if you want to remember so we can talk about it later  so that's all this is   so i'm just going to give you these   let's start off let's just pass it all back word  there  and you can have some pencils too just in case you do feel  like you want to  cos all too often we come and we look at images and we intuitively ask the right questions and make the right conclusions and judgements but sometimes you know in this sort of situation you sort of miss one or two things   great  i've got  that's here and also this is an evaluation  we're starting a little  at the end if i can get that back from you that would be great  response   now what i'm going to do is let you go into the galleries   all rights and reality is in this right-hand gallery and uhm it starts here after stephanie colvy's with uhm sheryl albuquerque here and then you just follow it all the way around going sort of to your left  around and around  okay you're on your own for a few minutes   so i'm going to give you about fifteen so maybe a few words oh about twenty twenty to well twenty to two recording shuts off   now then we've all gone through the exhibition i'd like your impressions of it  what did you think of the project and then the idea of this  as as a project conversation with extra-corpus speakers, two minutes, forty-five seconds   uhm it's always easier to look at images that are  pa ah that are exotic because one you're   you're looking at things you don't always see and you're looking at people who you know  i mean sure we see asians and and we see latin americans here in this country but we're just seeing them in circumstances that you don't normally see so you can suspend your uhm relationship with them  but then when you see the images the canadian images that's  how did you relate to these  how'd you claire beaugrand-champagne  what do you think about her photographs   asks for clarification   the montreal photographs  answer   the one thing too i i want you to know that if if you hate something say i hate it  you don't have to like it just cos it's hanging on the wall  like that's not that's not how it works  uhm if you really don't think something is effective or you don't like a photographer's style tell me because in some cases well i'll agree with you  and and it's important cos that's how we make decisions about what what we like and what we don't like conversation with extra-corpus speakers, three minutes   okay  what about uhm if i said uh cher  cheryl   ya  what if i said that cheryl uses uhm uh photographic metaphor   and if you use look at the photograph of the kids in the tree would everyone look at that and read the text that goes with it response from multiple extra-corpus speakers   ya okay  that photograph is really a metaphor  and in in the same and you can use metaphors   f uhm visually in the same way that you can use metaphors  uhm in speech so that you can have that same way of constructing meaning  that the same way that you can construct a metaphor out of words in a sentence you can construct a metaphor out of images in the frame of a photograph  and if you look at that one in particular what you see is a little girl knocking sticks out of a tree with a little boy sitting up in the branches  and then when you read the text the text tells you that by age eleven she's going to be married and as he uhm gets older he's going to assume a more powerful role in the community and will probably take over from his father as being the sultan or whatever it is of that community  so she is always going to be ah as a woman uh and a married woman in a subservient role to him  he will always be in a patriarchal position to her  he'll always be elevated  he'll always be on a throne  he'll always be above her  so you get from this image uh the whole fact that it's in a tree and trees symbolizing generations and life and sort of ah a perpetuity and the fact that this is a cultural group who are comfortable within their cultural norms   although they are trying the women in these communities are uhm trying to establish certain changes but not massive changes  they like being uh muslims  they like living the way they do  there are just a few things they want to change  uhm so it's not like there's going to be this huge massive  female revolution going on there and a whole change in their whole sensibility  and that photograph works as a metaphor  so she likes to use that  do you see what i'm getting at   okay  what about with uhm iva zimova   what what do you notice about how she sets up her shots  cos partly why i'm i'm drawing attention to this is so when you're taking photographs while you're making images that you can sometimes think about references that references  that uhm make people remember other things that are going to make the point you're trying to get across that much more solid  and that's predominantly what iva does  well i'll let you pick out something  try to figure out where i'm going with this  how does she shoot   answer   mhh hmm   answer continued   mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm   what about the first image the larger image or especially a number of the images that are in the contact sheets  uh you might be able to see them from here  see  so there's some images in the contact sheet in the lower half plus the large image and in particular say the second last image also the subway image  wha what how  are they set up  what's the shot set-up for that   answer   mhh hmm   right  exactly   and so how does that make you feel when you look at it   responses from multiple extra-corpus speakers   well she likes to use movement in her frames  you can see that by people gesturing   so she likes to have this idea of movement that something is actually flowing  there's ah ah energy that's going on in the image  but also when she uses these tilted camera perspectives  it gives you a bit of an unbalanced feeling a little bit  when you look at this you realize that it's tilted so  you're kind of it's knocking you off balance   and it's very subtle but you're trying to you're  you're trying to make your eye straighten it you're trying to fix it but it's knocking you a little off balance  uhm in art history have you studied the expressionists and sort of early uhm eastern european uh say czech modernists uh any of the any of the artwork coming out of pre-war germany  uh late-twenties or late-thirties  does anybody know what i'm talking about  expressionism  okay  do you remember what their what their  uh posters and the their ph their photographs predominantly their posters were like   lots of tilted angles  has anyone ever seen the movie the uhm cabinet of dr. caligari  no  oh if you ever get a chance see it  it's fabulous  but what it is is that uh this whole movement this whole art movement uhm in pre-war between the two wars in germany predominantly was uhm word rise of  fascism coming about and things were becoming more and more uh politically unstable and it was becoming more and more difficult for people to actually make political statements uh political statements came about visually and by artists  and what they did is they created images of their world that were completely off-balancing  uhm so you would have posters around town that were shot funny angles  there'd be a lot of printing cut-out letters lots of uh applied uhm images  but photography played a big role in this  and film work as well  a lot of the early russian filmwork you'll find tilted angles uhm sho uh the uhm funny shots uhm that are out of perspective and then you have t   because it it wants to make you confused  and essentially that's what this style of work was  now when you see a modern photographer  modern like she's in her early-thirties and she lives in canada  well she lives in in kiev at this point  but but coming from canada  uhm using references like this that make you think back to the twenties and thirties in germany and she's talking about something specific
