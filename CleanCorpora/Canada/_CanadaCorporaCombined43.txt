 what were we using last time  we had books  were we using big heavy books  mhh hmm   mhh can you move it over here so i can see no speaking, cooking noises 10 seconds     wow no speaking, cooking noises 35 seconds   where's louisa   i don't know  she left at about what one o'clock  ya     two words   cough so she's not moving into annette 's place eh  who's annette   annette geneverse that live up on  word janet   i don't know  i never talk to her  i never talked to her about where she was going  i remember coming home and then saying there were cockroaches   somewhere   oh ya that was that was   word   huh kay okay trade  okay i'll do it for awhile  i don't mind   shake shake shake  shake your booty  oh i can't wait for the sushi  it's gonna going to be so delicious  what are we doing   like i think it's a bit too wet  word word the steam  as long as it sticks  ya   is this the secret though  is the secret supposed to be in the rice  mhh hmm   yup   is it okay  mhh hmm  it's pretty vinegary  really  i wonder if we need some more rice  because word   we should have the mix  can't mix rice with it though  remember when we got more rice   words   is that more rice  no we've got more rice in there   oh i think we should use it all  cos it was only like cough a cup and a quarter  well it was one of those blue cups and a quarter raw  ya and we're supposed to add two so that's why i didn't add it all  but raw the whole thing was one cup and a quarter  ya and i guess words   and we're supposed to add two   two cups raw   two cups raw  ya but that's why it's so vinegary because i put enough in  for   for two cups  ya  ya raw so this is  okay okay okay  i'm sorry   laugh   oh we had our meas  measurements we all had our measurements different  yup   laugh   word that's a big one  word stir very careful  i was thinking tape error 6 seconds   no i really don't  i would love to cut the fish  do you want to fan  i'll fan you cut the fish  word   i'm gonna going to start at   oh no probably about ten minutes ago in fact     words   i want that word   that's for craving a starch at that precise moment   it is starchy  oh she rinsed it too didn't she   where are the uhm   it's all coming back to me now  ya ya you're supposed to rinse the rice  laugh   oh no are you  ya you're always supposed to rinse rice actually  oh no   oh well  here hold   shitty  where do you have a towel tammy   here i'll words   could you just turn the water off   we're descending into chaos now  ya   oh well  we'll just know for next time but  two or three words nari took over to like the guy behind the counter who uhm who   cuts fish and he said i got this friend over here she's buying some salmon for sushi i want you to slice the skin off for her  really nice and thin   oh ya   okay     laugh   don't lose any of the meat  she paid a lot of money for it  oh that's so good  ya it's so good  and he's like pointing at me like i was paying for the fish and  word we'll take care of you  don't worry about it quote spoken in feigned accent  now you're supposed to cut against the grain  words   okay i was going to cut in two long pieces and then cut this way   that's good   that's really good  is that what nari said  ya and the fish-cutting guy said that too  cut against the grain okay i'm just gonna  going to slice it down the middle though so that we have   do you want like that long a strip  i don't think it matters  we can always put   do you know what i'm gonna  going to do  no  it'll be easier just to slice it  i don't know  like it's really long slices  like if i word   no i just mean like instead of doing it in blocks cos then you'll have to  ya  what i was going to do was cut it to about there   slice it like this so that each piece will be similar in length right  mhh hmm   you know what i mean  ya words   you think i should just   no no no i'm going to cut it like this and like this  so they'll be one two three chunks  and each chunk will be similar in length  oh  that's okay  is that okay  yup  this is really vinegary  ya  i'm sorry/[>  even with all the rice in it  ya   >  mhh hmm   well keep on word   well i think it needs more sugar  okay  cos some of the sugar got stuck to the bottom  it didn't dissolve in the vinegar  three or words added it word  i'm sure we can  but not just straight vinegar sugar   we'd have to melt it with with   ya  what did you what did you do before you did  you did rice vinegar   rice vinegar and sugar and salt  ya it's fine  you you heated it up  ya  ya  ya  ya   ya   cos if you just put sugar we'll just like  you'll taste the granules of sugar on it  ya it'd be kind of weird   but then not vinegar  well we can just heat up a teeny bit of water  and dissolve the sugar in it  ya  that would be really wet laugh   get it almost so there's no water left   then just let it boil away  does the fish feel okay  oh ya it feels fine but really hard to cut uh   two words   do you want a serrated knife  no i actually think uhm that long  the big huge one  the big  you love that one  laugh my favourite knife   mhh humh  this one   yeppers   like that much  it called for three tablespoons   well it's basically dissolved   i'm cutting it really thin or i'm i'm  trying to cut it as thin as possible  okay   and i'll just let it boil down  i think we should use this for wasabi   definitely   phrase cooking  hmm  like we'll boil it down so there's almost no liquid  oh oh oh  and that way we won't get it so wet  uhm i should probably get more cigarettes  do you have any jan   no  uhm well yes i do but i need more  tammy could you grab me a pack  yup   and there's money in my bag 10 seconds silence   so how do you make this  you just mix it with water until it's pastey  that's what it says  mhh hmm  so how much  a teaspoon   just put that in first  ya like a teaspoon  and then you just do   like you need just a little bit of water  like you can just sprinkle it in with your fingers   i love wasabi   i love raw fish  wasabi's just word   we'll have to we'll have to   wasabi kay okay  things that we'll have to translate   wasabi ya   wasabi uhm  what's what's the name for seaweed  nori   nori   nori   how should i cut the avocado  good job on the salad  is it too thick you think  no  i think when you eat it in a restaurant uh well it's usually  what's it called when you put the sush the sushi  the meat just on top of the rice  is that that's sushi    that's sushi   that's sushi  like they're usually quite thick  that's right  so we're gonna going to roll them though heh  ya  ya  we could try a couple of little  tammy was thinking of trying the uhm   like putting the fish on top of the rice with a bit of wasabi in between and then wrapping a bit of nori around it  like just a slit like a putting the rice putting the fish on top of the rice like you get in a restaurant  and just wrapping with one  strip of nori  okay and just wrapping it up   mhh hmm   this is very strange  it's very tasty  should i have washed the fish before i started cutting it  oh no i don't think so  you don't think so   you think this is too uhm pastey or do you think we need more water  more water ya  so you can sort of dip it  but it's usually kinda kind of   word   hmh ya i guess     two or three word this is fun whispered  it says to let it sit five or six minutes   is nari really approachable  oh ya  ya he's awesome  ya  he's a really friendly guy  why you thinking about going to copacabana  copacabana  should i try that   you should
