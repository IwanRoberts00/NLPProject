   also you have to consider what kind of income the beneficiary will have at at the time of your death  so you can figure out what kind of cash money you wanna  want to leave them and what could be locked into ah a trust or some somewhere else you know  so what you have to be careful about uh most of the time is  to the uh to make a proper roll over of the r s p  that is the first main thing to do  complicated stuff  yeah it is  what what about a living will  does that have to be drawn up separately  actually the living will is drafted along with the mandate in case of incapacity   uh it doesn't go with the will because the will would only take effect if you died   so the living will is like for the period a little before that time  so that can be it is recognized  as as having a legal impact or legal value but  it it has to be in a separate document  mmm   hmm hmm   okay  ha have you encountered some nightmarish stories in your business about when people don't make these kinds of careful provisions  oh yeah a lot  actually i could give you an example in which they had a will yes  they'd uh was uh was like given to  uh to the wife  that was mainly it  it was what we call a universal legacy you know like i give and bequeath all my uh my uh assets  to my wife for example okay   yeah   just in one general chunk  okay   but they called they called us uh four months after the time of death and they didn't do the transfer of the r s p to the wife because the will did not specified that the r s ps were to be roll-overed not 'rolled-over' to the wife  hmm  so what they had to do then  ah they could have done otherwise but since they called like only four months after the death ah they had unregistered all of the r s ps so they had to pay forty five thousand dollars in taxes   that they could have avoided otherwise  yeah mm   mmm   well that's quite a warning  thank you very much  you're welcome  georges arnaud is a lawyer who specializes in estate tax planning drawing up wills and such   it's just sixteen minutes now before eight o'clock here on daybreak  well you've seen them in the gym before their faces are scrunched up in pain and they're dripping with sweat they're obsessed with counting reps and sets and they rush to book their time on the stairmaster  for these people exercise is a science  it's about burning fat and developing that perfect body but montreal sports psychologist tim savage says they're taking the wrong approach  he's written a book called the exercise habit and he says exercise not only gets us in shape physically but also mentally  he joins me now  good morning  mr savage are you there  oh! hang on  we'll get back to mr savage in just a moment  ah first we'll just take a look at uhm the uh  this will help us mentally and ev even  physically if you're gonna going to be going out there jogging  take a look at the fine weather picture we have today   well i spoke a little earlier about those people in pain dripping as they exercise in the gym  and uh word montreal sports psychologist  tim savage who says that's that's the wrong approach  don't think about calories and building the perfect body  he's written a book called the exercise habit and uh talks about as much uh the importance of getting mentally fit as physically fit  and he joins me now  good morning mr savage   good morning alana   ahh so what does exercise do for us mentally  well i think that it exercise is no different from many of the other things that we do in life that it has all of the potential for satisfying a wide variety of our needs including the need for uh sociability meaning playfulness ah challenge competition et cetera  and uh i think that one of the the  major problems i see with the exercise world as it exists today is that it is too narrowly focused on uh body motives that uh we look at it as something that we take on in order to change our bodies or to perhaps deal with a health problem but i think that uh for a lot of people it   it has to do with uh attaining some ideal physical shape or losing weight and as such it becomes uhm a limited uh application of exercise where people will uh try to put their mind into neutral or distract themselves by reading or talking to someone  it's just something to get over get over  with as soon as possible sort of  get through the pain  yeah oh oh i mean it it's   horrible  i work out at a a gym where i listen to people in the locker room and i remember one fellow saying ah you know i i come here every day and i hate it  laugh and but i  ha i have to do it   and i think wow what an attitude  and what are you building into your experience by every day doing something for about an hour that you hate  and and you can see that reflected in the rest of his  attitude  i think that what we need to do is to look at exercise as something that we're making a lifelong commitment to  and that it will affect us in ah our mind and our body our spirits  and and to try to build it in more holistically rather than focus it as something that is only going to work on our fat cells or develop m uh muscle tone  that that it can give us so much more  it can uh help to develop a sense of challenge in our lives  it can uh introduce an element of fun and excitement  it can uh bring a certin kind of expressivity into how we live our lives  i it can uh enable us to feel more centered more powerful in ourselves and to look at it in terms  of of how it will help us to attain the  the aspects or dimensions of our lives that we develop in ourselves and not  just look to look at it   as a as a physical thing  how horrible that   hmm   broader hmm   hmm mmm i imagine you get less discouraged and less likely to drop off an exercise programme when you don't look at it on  along those narrow lines as well  well i i think that what happens is that someone engages in an exercise programme with the goal of losing five pounds or ten pounds and uhm it's like the yo-yo diet it's   the the yo-yo exercise plan where people will  exercise for a while and quit and uh then exercise again  and it and it becomes very aversive because if each time you uh enter an exercise uh programme you do it with an attitude of i hate this or this is drudgery  then it it isn't going to last and we really need to incorporate in our lives a lifelong plan not just something that is going to be a quick fix for an immediate problem  hmm   so how do we make it more pleasant  is it a matter of choosing the right exercise  it it's partly choosing the right exercise bu and the right exercise will change from from time to time from year to year depending on on what your needs are  i think it's really useful to have a a   kinda kind of like a bag of tricks a bag of exercises that that you know and that you can do  and uh depending on your mood depending on your needs at that particular time you may go running you may go swimming you may b  play a game of volleyball  you may just go for a walk you may do yoga you may do tai chi  and all of the different exercise forms uh will cater to different needs that you have  the other thing i think which is even far more important than that is to broaden our notion of what exercise is  that exercise is something that has become uhm so narrowly defined as this this ritualistic activity that we do   w   yeah and and with our special outfits  and and it's crazy because uhm exercise really has to do with the expenditure of of effort  and and we can do that in so many ways  and if we take it out of the gym if we take it out of these narrow confines then what it allows us to do is to see all of the opportunities that we have for movement  my father-in-law is a wonderful example  he will go to an exercise class but when uhm his wife asks him uh to go for a walk he won't go for a walk because she likes to walk around and just look at things and stop and talk to people  and for him that's that's   not exercise laugh yeah and  and uh he'll uh he'll get up and he'll do push-ups uhm he'll do all sorts of things that are very ritualistic but in terms of just going out and and pushing the lawnmower around the lawn no he hires someone to do that  and and i think that we need to  bring back into our lives those things that labour-saving devices have have removed from our lives to to uh incorporate activities that are just uhm uh word  yeah  sweating on the machine kind of thing   it's not goal-oriented enough for him   that's just wandering   incidentally exercise yeah   well thank you very much mr savage   an interesting perspective  you're welcome  tim savage is a montreal sports psychologist who has written a book called the exercise habit  it's just seven minutes now before eight o'clock on daybreak  music   the forty-three canadian peacekeepers removed from their observation posts in a battle zone in croatia are safely back at their base  the soldiers are part of the seven hundred and sixty member   contin canadian contingent based in rastovic  they were moved from their posts friday by croatian soldiers to thirty kilometres away to zadar when it became apparent they were outnumbered and were in a battle zone  lieutenant commander ken watson joins us now uhm with more on this  ah good morning  good morning  tell me what what happened to these soldiers when they were ah removed from their posts and taken to zadar  well ah first of all i have to correct your premise uh  i had some erroneous i information   earlier that said they were returned back to rastovic  in fact they are still in zadar  uh huh  they have not gotten back  what uh happened last night was that we had one of our resupply convoys and some soliders who had been on uh an r and r programme out of the area uh for a little rest and relaxation they were the ones that managed to return uh about one o'clock in the morning our time  the forty-three soldiers are still in zadar  they are staying in a uh croatian barracks uh area being very well treated  they were never ever uh captives in the true sense of the word or prisoners  they were simply uhm uh once uh it was clear that uh the croatians were going to evict them in uh and in the face of uh overwhelming odds they had no choice but to leave  they were simply escorted out of the area uh out of the battle zone area to zadar where they have been uh very very well treated by the croatians and uh  we're simply now negotiating ah an a  time that is mutually convenient really that they can return back to the main base camp in rastovic  how gently were they escorted out of there?  we heard they were taken out by gunpoint?  well the confrontations that occurred in each of the observation posts uh were basically uh soldiers coming up saying okay you have to leave our soldiers saying no not   not a chance we're not leaving and uh at which point the croatians arrived with uh an overwhelming force uh armed with uh rocket-propelled grenades uh uh large numbers of soldiers
