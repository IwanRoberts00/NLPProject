 ya  cos i took this out of the the baker book so uh ya okay  right   i see mumbles under her breath   definition   okay   uhm and then uh this whole idea of multicultural policy and uh  like multilingualism being encouraged but   you know the perception being you know that some are  generally supportive but there're problems with the from the point of view of the immigrant uh people  mhh hmm   ahh   some people feel that it's been used to keep them in their place and create a vertical mosaic uhm others uh you know it's been kind of just another ina for and in that way a kind of a segregation word and uhm  mumbles   and it's also kind of politically motivated  and in a way it reinforces the power structures that   that are already in place  because on one one article i read they were saying that you know  oh was it ab about   it was about australia actually  that if minority groups uh attempt to make any change in that structure it's not perceived  no it wasn't about australia  it was about canada  it was about if the minority population makes some attempt to  take some initiative in changing the structures or suggestions for how they would like to have their language maintained it's not always viewed positively by the government  the example was quebec with bill one oh one  quebec law affirming french as the official language and it was seen   as very as as a threat  mh hmm   mhh hmm  i think  i forget which article that's in but  uhm that was  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   so i was looking at the minority's perspective on uh  ya i think that was edwards  i mean he went on great length about that  ya he did   i mean that was an eighty page article   and romaine agreed with it  and romaine agreed with him she said  hmm  i think  it's probably in in the summary there that i was looking at yesterday  no   mumbling it's a symb   symbolic   it's two or three words   what happens is there's a sym  symbolic form  of ethnicity and uh that you know people are comfortable with it at a symbolic or kind of as a concept but something that uh alters reality  was a statement that came into it as  something that people are not comfortable with so  ya well   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh   but you're heading right into a political discussion   here power discussion  mhh hmm   do you want to go into that  well the next section  okay  you might want to just read this over but the next section  after that i go into that was on political  socio-political and educational   context and uhm uhh ya that then  you know that that this idea of ah language being a banner for as an ethnic identity  mhh hmm   right   i mean this is this is our banner  this is our symbol of our ethnic identity and then using that   for political as a s s  in the political arena   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   but i don't know ma   may wha i don't know i think i may have covered too many things and i should probably do some   of redo some of this   ya cos it's not a thesis   okay i was just wondering on how many pages would be appropriate approximately for for this paper  but i think i covered like lots of things maybe not as deeply as i need to  it's word   i just kind of like feel like that but  exhale   ya ya   students always want to know how many pages  well i know seven's not enough laugh   i always say laugh   i always say as long as it needs to develop your ideas but uhm  i think you ought to be able to do something in twenty to twenty-five pages don't you  mhh hmm   i think that that   and when when would this need to be in by so that i don't get an i p can mean " in progress"   i need to graduate this semester laugh   you do  cos i'm going back to b c british columbia   ya   okay   i haven't got we haven't got the grade sheets in yet  so you don't know   and so you'll be a graduating one  uhm so i yes i don't know  okay  uhm how how are you fixed for time  well uh i'm not going  i'm not   are you going to devote yourself to this  at the moment   ya   i'm i've just picked out the comps  comprehensive exams on tuesday and they do april  thirtieth   are you going to be able to work on this as well as the comps  laugh i'm gonna going to  have to  mhh hmm   what uhm   i could find out  you haven't spoken to rick about deadlines for getting all the grades in or anything but if you've got until the thirtieth of april for your comps by the time people read them and get in their grades i imagine we're talking the fifteenth of may aren't we  ya   that sounds sounds reasonable  it looks to me laugh it'd be two weeks  ya   ya ya  it's ah ya it is a question i have as to how i'm gonna going to do both  but i have this paper  i have something to finish up for the supervision course that i was doing with booker   and that's not very much   that's not very much at all i don't think   okay   i mean i've been working on it  i was reviewing articles and i've been working on that   for that last  month or so and getting diary entries as i was visiting students with diana and that  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  so it's a matter of pulling it together   so  so that's not going to take me more than  well i i say a day so it'll probably be like two or three laugh you know but  mhh hmm   so there's this and the comps and uh  mhh hmm   these things always take more time  especially the fiddly things at the end   ya   i would appreciate it if like the deadline wasn't the same day  as and at the same time as the comps  if i could have an extra week   that would really help me  just because you know i'll be  wor working like i like to kind of do two things at once  anyway   two or three words oh no    sure   of course of course   mhh hmm   it's all right to   mhh hmm  but uhm   switch back and forth  and and i've done   mo most a lot of reading for this already  ya   it's not like the comps so   yes like that you've done a lot of  yes  and are your comps i i is  it going to touch on anything like this  no   laugh no i've sort of got a smattering of every  laugh bit of applied linguistics going i think  laugh it's all right laugh ahh  i had two words   laugh with word me    i really i really uh  uh  some a few words   i i don't know   what do you think  do you think that it's uh it's going to be uhm possible to do both  i mean i   oh sure  of course it is  i think so  i i know i'm going to be busy but   i think that word   graduate students when they're about to graduate can  work miracles so not a problem  laugh oh gosh   uhm  but i don't mind  you know like i was thinking if it was even due the first week of may i if that's not too late to get the marks in uhm   well i will find out about that  ya   but the beginning of may looks very good for me  i will what i will say to you is that as soon as i get it i will act on it immediately and that's  why i was looking at my book  ya   i don't want it before the sixth   okay well that's kind of the sixth looks good   and uh because then i  cos i've got all day meetings on the thursday and friday so i really can't touch it then  awright all right so you can't touch it then   and uh if i have it on the sixth i'll do it right away  the only problem will be if i can't get an extension  for uhm i if your mark is due  in   that's ya   but i don't think it is  you know i really don't think  i think they're probably not going to be after us until  if   well i was wondering  you know i don't know if i can change my mind about the comps but you know in one way this is far more important to me  i've been last semester i had really good marks  this is a topic that i i'm really   interested in  ya   i don't want to just you know  you know exhale i don't want to just hand you a paper   that's   mhh hmm   you know what i'm saying  i want to work on it work through it and   ya and you want to get something out of it  ya ya   ya ya i think that's   and i want to be sure i i i  gave it the effort and time that i  that i can give  not where i'm just sorta sort of   saying well here i'm done here's my last paper boom i'm   outta out of here  mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm   okay   i i don't i don't  feel good about that  it hasn't served me well in the past   let me   i'll check with that   so i would appreciate that  but i i am like i i i  know that uhm i i want to get things wrapped up this semester because it it just i i'd just  like to be finished you know   well you're right at the end so   it's it's been two years for me  i you know i started  yes   that's a long time  so i word   sure   but if it has to be different then definitely then   it has to be done differently   ya ya   okay well  no i think that uh we can certainly work that out end of tape   so i would like to discuss now what seems to be  happening uh with respect to uhm the childhood uhm or the nursery problem  and what's funny is is uhm as of yet two words not caught up there's na   no mention yet of this in in  the english papers  but what we see happening now is cough uh basically duplessis is starting to try to wrestle the power away from the federal government   mhh  okay  there's this whole thing that starts up about uhm family allocations and uh basically somebody you know says that the federal government uh what is it uhm the laws by the federal government are unconstitutional   here we are  monsieur choquette by the way j&eacute;r&ocircumflex;me choquette  remember him  oh yes   i wonder if he was related  uh said this law is unconstitutional and has to be replaced and basically what we have is the union nationale led by maurice duplessis taking away power over the family uh from the federal government and that's where you can see what's going to happen  mhh   because uh it starts off as kind of a shouting match between uh duplessis and king who was prime minister at the time  over who has the rights over the family  mhh hmm   uh which is finally uh mister king  apologizes and basically gives the power over to the quebec government  who immediately uh attempt to create uhm  oh what was it called  uh uhh kind of ah ah  here it is  an inscription of child families  they basically want to start a list of families  a list   and they they've  basically got their own ideas about how they're gonna going to run families and uh daycare nurseries have nothing to do with it  mhh hmm   uh they are very profoundly pro-catholic  and uh anti-federalist anti-interference  mhh hmm   uhm so we're definitely gonna going to   laugh be headed away from the daycares   yes   so it doesn't surprise me that by october of forty-five   it closed   mhh hmm   what's the point of the list of having a list  it just seems to be kind of ah a combination census   and and kind of a list of who who  should we allocate these funds to who's gonna  going to get this money  mhh hmm
