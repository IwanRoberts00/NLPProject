parents   that's great  you know  word knock at the door   come in  feel like a teacher brief conversation between extra-corpus visitor and speaker a, about 25 seconds   lynda how was your week  okay

you know  i can take care of it fine   but it's ah  so it was a uh crazy day word have  a tough day  you can read about it in my journal  and i was a little disturbed with the other kindergarten teacher laugh     oh really  she came up to me last friday and said i hear you're coming back to redwood   that's great  uhm if i can give you some advice though she says i think  laugh i think you would be better off in the grade two class     / yeah   why are you going to grade one  so i i put it on i said well my supervisor placed me laugh starts in grade one laugh ends   thank you very much laugh   and uhm she says well you know you're very good with the kids  and i thought well thank you but  oh i'm sorry tara comment addressed to teacher  inaudible comment addressed to speaker c perhaps   she said they could really use you in grade two in grade one they have a resource teacher and     thanks to someone else   and i don't really understand why you're going there   and word   and she ended it like that  yeah  and i said well i said that's where i've been placed and  and that's where i'm going  that's where i'm going  that's right  and that's it   and i thought wooh  how

birdwatching unit  oh great  we did an experiment today   and uh i was teaching them how ducks are waterproof and  they don't get wet  and i have this book called ducks don't get wet   and there's a little experiment in the book  mumbled one or two words   so what i did at first i mixed uhm ah gree  green ah pff blue water with yellow water  and i told them i said what do you think will happen if i  blend these two together  will they mix  will i get like blue and yellow and they're like no you'll get green you silly others laugh   like they're saying silly but they were looking at me as if i'm stupid others laugh   so we did that i said okay our predictions were good and i was telling them that scientists make predictions and   so i said well here i have another bottle of water and they said put red red so i put in red dye   and then uhm i had oil   i said this is oil  feel it and we're all touching the oil and we all like  we all like greasy hands and i said do you think the water and the oil will mix  oh yes yes yes  i said you sure like you won't get water and then a strip of  oil and  so we made i had a prediction sheet and i ticked off we said yes they all said yes laugh   and then i said nobody's saying no you know  so i didn't put my no i just left it like that   and then course it didn't mix and then i read them the book and they had to uh draw oh i've got it with me laugh i'm so proud of it others laugh   well i photocopy everything they do in their bird journal right   and so they had to draw the experiment  ducks don't get wet because their feathers are covered with oil  we did a science experiment and discovered that water and oil do not mix   isn't that nice   mm and uh of course i had this made up  others laughter starts before the experiment others laughter ends   and then this is my picture of our science experiment  the photocopier kinda kind of cut it off  so i had the bottle on the table and they just sat around in a circle   just drawing the bottle and   that's neat   so that was really fun   let's see the journal  that's cute  oh uhm  that's mine   this is a math one that i did  they just had to count and then write how many  y you know what  you can take these ideas and use them  with any theme  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   yeah  oh  yeah  and then oh yes   if i could be a bird i would be a   he said a blue jay and  he told me  he didn't feel like writing it down so i tried but he told me because i like bluejays so i wrote it for him  and then this is another one where they all  each child had a strip of ten birds  mm hmm  i think you saw this one word       mm hmm
