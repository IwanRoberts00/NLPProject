ottawa u university  sucks  laugh well at least you still get the science citation index in books dammit  well we're probably gonna going to  get something like that you know  cra crazy what a  what a mistake  doctor mckenzie 's really peeved at the librarians needless to say  although wha what   you know in theory it it sounds pretty neat  ya it does you know   word you write everything down  you say sheet a   two words ya exactly you know  but like i mean to students  fuff could be the three word    and that's the somehow what they   if only somehow they could make like a main system  you know where it's so that anyone can have access to it at anytime  yes if if they network it  like the like the normal data search system  ya  ya that'll be fine cos then you could access it by the internet  you can access it on any terminal  ya   that'll be perfect  words   and like more people can you know access  it at once  mhhm   but so far they got one dedicated computer that isn't networked  which is dumb  it's really confusing when i went in today mmm puff  the uh  taste good ya laugh   ugh there's too many bugs here  laugh   they all love me  laugh it's the glasses that's what it is  bug-glasses  laugh you got it  mhhhmmm bug noise   laugh   you just awful a guy  argh   okay sorry laugh laugh   go ahead laugh   actually i'm not that bad  anne gets the worst   what  everytime we go out bugs follow her  mhhm   i don't know what she wears   laugh laugh   they love her  they eat her  laugh eau de f one  generation laugh i don't know  ya   but oh ya anyways what i

scary  eh no endorsements  no endorsements laugh   laugh   jee  well  laugh i'm actually i think  we're gonna going to i'm gonna  going to give my mac to my parents in the next few weeks and cos carleton university  is selling off a uh a mac that's   that's going out of issue i guess  laugh   it it's a  about a four eighty-six twenty-five megahertz equivalent  s x  i guess  oh that's gonna going to be ancient  ya i know  but uh   but you mean you're getting an i b m  no no i'm getting a mac the mac equivalent of a four eighty-six twenty-five  oh okay okay alright   but see it's uh it's one thousand dollars with like a two hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive monitor  four megabytes ram  that's not bad   see so that's not a bad price  so i word   and considering what you're going to be doing with it  exactly ya you know  it'll still run cd-rom stuff and so on if i want but uh i i   hmm   does it come with a cd-rom  no it doesn't no  but my mom has eighteen hundred in grant money and she's  gotta has got to she's gotta   has got to spend that by the end of this summer  or she loses it  laugh ya right my mom even paid for half of your med school bill laugh   buy your uh rice-a-roni or kraft dinner for the year okay jeez  laugh   but word she has that much to spend  yes  mhh   so she's got uh laugh   i'll talk to ya after laugh   no but she's gonna going to get uh like the uhm the mac and then she's gonna  going to get a hard drive for my old one  uh huh  it's only bout about a forty  and then maybe gonna going to get a cd-rom or a colour printer  my dad wants a colour printer so we'll see  mmh  ya that'd be nice laugh   cool   ya  well he my dad wants to get a colour and then just network it cos now we got three macs in the house so all the macs use the same printer  it'll work nice  hmm you have to be in the same room no  no it's different just cable ya   word get long cables   well there's uhm see we got the house renovated we got uh  cable outlets put out put in around the house and i think they're wired in the walls   so we could probably   i don't know if we could do that  that's to put telephones in no  oh no cable  ya  no th i think it's by like an eighteen cable so maybe we can't use the cable outlets we have  like the outlets are cable as in t v cable  ya but unless maybe you might have an interface or something  no idea  if it's like by telephone cable then that's just two wires essentially  you could marry that easy to a coaxial cable  we'll see i don't know  central system  in the word duh duh duh duh duh  'mission impossible' theme hummed   here at the computing centre about brandy   we had the best alright   i don't know   printers   s printers laugh   computers and uh   rabbit pictures laugh   laugh that's it ya   nov nov   novelty items  laugh novelty items  uh nevermind laugh   laugh   speaking of which no not novelty items okay my twisted mind came up with three dimensional objects and computers okay  uh but there there's a system   physiziss physicists and engineers have been using and it's and actually a bio  biological application i had read about   uhm what it is is it's a uh uh uh it's a   pool of p polymer essentially that is heated by laser  when it's heated by laser it dr dries  solid to a plastic  and this laser is hooked up to a computer and if you give it a three dimensional graphic it will cool thin layers of plastic on top of each other until it gets the three dimensional object  oh no way   two words   ya it's totally cool  and what they did was they uh did x-rays of a uh no i guess it'd be magno magnetic  resonance imaging of a of a of a mummy cos they wanted to look at the skull shape and stuff or some sort of   was this on the discoverer   i think it was i can't remember  it was in the   cos i re remember   some i remember reading bout  about something like that   ya and then they did it  they they s did i guess m r i of the uh the skull so they didn't have to dissect it and then they recreated a three dimensional uh replica of the skull  mhhm   ah   it it was really  impressive  i don't think i we i remember re   i didn't ch i didn't  catch on about the three dimensional plastic making thing  laugh laugh making thing  laugh device laugh   that's it   device that's a word for a scientist now laugh   device words the uh   device is just a word that word a  word laugh   yes laugh device  arnold schwarzenegger ya   have you seen the critic  nope no i ha no  they ah they were reviewing a uh  cough arnold schwarzenegger movie on the critic kind of thing  it was rabbi p i with arnold schwarzenegger laugh   no   laugh ya he was bad  it was really good  man  i that's done by the same guys who did the simpsons  like not matt groening but two of the other guys who produce it  ya  ya  he doesn't do much though does he matt groening   i always see is his name on like developed by bang  or uh creative consulting or something ya   laugh   so i guess he just thought up the characters   he just rakes in the royalties laugh   well i think initially he helped more but uh  well no on the on the halloween specials i think he was listed as a producer  mhhm   maybe not i don't know  see that's how what i don't understand about this showbiz stuff  you get like okay produced by so and so directed by  such and such a blah blah blah film written by duh  duh duh you know like  who's the big boss here  mhhm   laugh   laugh   mhhm   laugh that's a tough call   see what what a producer does what   director generally creates the vision and says this is what i want to see  producer generally actually makes it come into being  they're both on the set  often the director will order actors and say uh i want you to do this i want to show this kind of emotion i want this set to look dark like this i want the lighting to be like this  the producer actually gets the lighting guy and says okay these are the kinds of levels we need set them up uhm i'll order some more lights for you i'll get this so  mhhm   i think the director is more visionary translates the writer's vision and the producer tends to help enact it  so when they say it's a such and s   such it's a so and so film so what does that mean  that guy like provides the cash   puff owns the company laugh   he brings the doughnuts everyday  that's the most important part laugh   i don't know  but i think that's like uh whoever owns the company  like the simpsons and so on was done by a group called klasky csupo  laugh i know what what a weird name laugh    was there a dog at the end  eh  was it the dog at the end no   no  oh well the company see it's a tough call  the animation's done by klasky csupo i think the filming or something or the printing of the film is another company  klasky csupo got big  they're doing they do like the simpsons the critic they do rugrats they do they do   a whole bunch of shows  it's funny now eh how like cartoons are  are being like sitcoms  yes i know eh laugh   well i guess we got sick of  i don't know i i'm if i watch like fresh prince or i don't know any of it almost any of those shows wings is one of the few that i kind of stand but  almost any other it's like ya it's typical sitcom funny  like you know they get in trouble they're  they do stupid things they're words   word to reach a  better understanding  exactly you know laugh   well what's funny is that how how  all these kind of crop up all at once   sniff excuse me   well how do you mean  like the animated ones versus the   ya l like  you have an animated one and then you know you come out with the critic you come out with the ru rugrats   beavis and butthead and what not  simpsons and uh   oh ya beavis and butthead  it comes out all at once  and then and then like you know you have a sitcom you know when the sitcoms come out then like you know the family sitcoms cosby show then you had the family ties you know family matters and stuff like that  yes ya hmph jeez  now now i think they're getting into like since rosanne come not 'came' out now they're getting into the dysfunctional families   laugh yes which is kind of disgusting  really laugh   you think  i don't know if i wanted to hear about  dysfunctional families ya   like see i i ehm i   i didn't watch em them so i don't know what they're about   oh okay ya well they're not bad comedy-wise but it is a little uh it's it's a little crude  and and   nah i don't it's not something i   wanna want to see
