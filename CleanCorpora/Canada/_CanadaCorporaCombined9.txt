 oh come on technically you've gotten better  and i think you've gotten more uh you got that first taste of stage stuff and you've done some since  you got more relaxed  cos we were scared crapless  the first time we were on the sca stage  we were like i i   was shitting my pants  and and then afterwards to find out that i didn't have my guitar loud enough i was like oh no  laugh   cos vin goes i heard the pick and i was like ahhh dammit you know you were supposed hear the guitar not the pick  laugh   oh well  well we'll see  ya  and uh i guess i should get some some   jazz songs from you or some ideas of what you'd like to do  deep breath   but i don't know how long do you wanna  want to play like  i don't even know like how long do you want us to play  ya i gotta got to find that out if he wants us for like laugh fifteen minutes two songs or if he wants us for like can you play four hours  uhh no  you know but uhm like i'd be willing to do if you wanted to do two sets   if you want to do one jazz and one uh beatles or something  or something just like chords to play  sure ya do some stuff like that  singing  i can play some s chords you sort of well  you play some chords also   do you remember how to play blues stuff like ta-ta ting   oh ya oh oh easy yes i would love that   laugh   maybe we could do something like that  could learn uh old time rock and roll  no huh laugh   but all i ever learned from that was duh duh duh duh duh duh dum duh duh duh duh guitar riff from the song old time rock n' roll  laugh   slike it's like okay where do we go from here laugh   hmm we'll see what we can do  ya   ya uh there were some interesting beatles stuff  i was thinking of sergeant peppers actually  that's a tough song to do you know sergean   sergeant the the kinda kind of   that song   ya  cos len also offered uh see they  they would've they've actually got a band len and a bunch of his friends  oh really  sort of  they they kind of they're working on  feeling how each other plays and playing off of each other and seeing what each other styles are like uh   ya   len 's a very good drummer and actually he's quite an organizer of the band  he really gets me in there  ohh   but uh him and the bassist the bassist is just starting out  he's rayne he lives on your street i believe  the red-haired kid who hangs out with len   he goes to st. word notre-dame  sam dontcha don't you mean  sam then laugh   it's not rayne it's sam   so he doesn't live on your street laugh and he's someone else entirely laugh   no   forget what i said  but uh the red-haired kid  laugh he's uh  with the dyed red hair or   laugh no au naturel   laugh   oh no then i don't know him  uh he's uh well he he started playing bass to kinda kind of be in this band and  he's ah he's a really nice guy and  he's he's a very good bassist actually   hmm   i don't know  i if they could learn it easy then that'd be cool  or if it's not too complicated then uh maybe we could try to incorporate it in  if it's too complex then we'll just say s  sorry only got so much time we can put into it  ya   ya for sure  okay   well i don't think it'll be you know it  it doesn't have to be uh you know a starlie   a sterling performance  yes  laugh like we're at the apollo  yes  mah psh vocalized noise   you should try for ah   like an open blues jam night or something like that   oh it'd be cool you know   it'd be cool but i think we need more  practice words   well ya true but you know they take everybody  and kids who can barely play uh twelve-bar blues to guys who've been playing in ottawa for thirty years  word   are you serious word anyone  sure ya i i've gone to them  geez i played the open jam at uh rasputin's which is a smaller bar on bronson with a friend one night cos we were just there and uh she said she knew the owner and she did this a lot and she said will you play with us and i was like i don't know okay i guess and   and how did that go  it went well  it was a little scary though because w   we we did uh scarborough fair  i figured well that's one i know you know but i couldn't remember the words  laugh so half way through i looked at the audience  laugh can anybody help laugh what the next verse is  somebody kinda kind of yelled out da da da  i said okay laugh but uh but  you know the audience was totally accepting and they  and there were two kids that went up that night too that were like they must have been playing electric guitar for maybe a month month and a half two words  their song and you know they tried and people clapped and  you know   mhhm   how old was this you know i think i've heard of this  ya they have one at the rainbow that's strictly blues and   is is often much more intense cos the band there  the houseband i think they're called what are they called something  zombie or something i don't know weird it's the houseband there they play with you if you want  so you can just go up like one guitarist and go up alone and have the whole band back him  oh wow   so but you don't have to but it's laugh i  it's a little more intimidating cos you got like four professionals backing you you know or whatever it is but  uh  wow   like it's uh i don't know jam it out  i'll learn some jazz you learn some blues  well you got the blues nailed down  words   well i could learn jazz anyways so  it's hard i don't know it's funny uhm  i was reading cos i had that ar   oscar peterson book and in back i was just reading a little bit and it's saying how it's hard for people who are trained classically to play jazz because it's a  it's a different form and all  that stuff and that's why he has like these exercise books  ya   oh really   ahh is it really it's it's   it seems to be i mean there seems to be more uhm i dunno don't know from when i from when i read from when i read in his music like what's written is more straight but when you play it it  you add a bit more uh you know you ad lib more   you two words you know more of a more  uhm   oh i see   mhhm   so it's more like those one of the uh kind of piano solos that were written out in classical music  what like a cadenza  that's it cadenzas laugh   but a real cadenza  hmm  but ya like there's more freedom you know like classical is a bit more rigid whereas you know i guess with the jazz well of course  you know jazz is ya it's more feel   it's more feel ya   it's for your heart and your soul all that sort of stuff  but i don't know i think for me like i mean once you learn a classical style you you're kinda  kind of set in that in that   mode so i think i need a teacher you know  anyway   well your stuff sounds pretty you put feeling into it there   i know but the thing is i want someone to say okay   like i want someone to teach me jazz like a cla   in in a classical two words   laugh i see struction   you know like structure  like this this is such and such a chord and like know what it sounds like and this is a certain riff that you can play rather than you know mumble and fumble through  mhhm   fumble through that through a piece and say  well this sounds like a chord here but might be a jazzy  meat huh   you know   mmm hmm   i don't know how it'd be related to others huh  and what else i'd li   like i'd like to learn is how to read from you know those fake books where they just write the melody lines and the chords   and then you improvise from that  yes laugh   ya that's amazing  you know it's like say  cos i'm sure there's some s some   sort of jazz structure there you know  and once you once you learn those chords down pat  ya   i think so   a few of the chords and probably some of the modes must be popular to use  mmm hmm   i don't know do you find that a particular melody  word or  see i i have no idea what mode i'm using  laugh oh okay oh well you know heh laugh    it's like okay uhm i'm in the key of uh  this uh f and i'm supposed to play uh you know so  laugh   hmm  and i'm sure there there must be some jazz theory you know  i don't think so  hmm we'll have to see  i wanna want to get some jazz c ds out at carleton three or four words learning c d-roms  oh ya   so ah ya  it's like if you uh cos i i know  i don't know a lot of jazz  and   i really haven't listened to it a lot  ya they're doing a word tape cuts out briefly ottawa too  hmm good stuff  you know what they've started doing at carleton did i tell you this i probably did putting the science citation index on one c d-rom  nope you didn't tell me that  they stopped getting the book okay  and the nice thing about getting the volumes in the science citation index was that if you were using like november nineteen ninety-three somebody else could use december nineteen ninety- two or  whatever everybody could use it  ya   they've got the whole thing on one c d-rom on one computer  mhh hmm   well that's stupid   for the whole like this is for  physics chemistry biology geology uh you know  all over it all over   like you know they all use it so laugh  this should be interesting  that's dumb they should do it by you know   two words   well ya i hope they'll network it maybe   ne next in next year's budget or something  but see one thing i found with the computer  is it's when you're trying to do a search  you have only a couple of key words you know  but uhm   yes   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   and sometimes the thing is is  that say you have like one key word that's you know quite broad  and it comes out okay two lines you know five hundred uh five hundred volume text  or ya you know like please narrow down your search   mhh hmm   laugh   or two thousand or three thousand ya ya i know   well wha what  and what gets me with that is that is i wish there was a card catalogue at least then you could see the general uhm like the call number like the general area anyway you'd go and you could look at the books and sometimes you don't even know what specifically you're looking for  yes   hmm  you know   well i ya we just got a new system and it will show you  it will show you   i if you have like  two thousand or three thousand entries and you get the time to go through them you can go through them   it'll show you it   ya  oh oh wow whispered   i i the only time it asks you is when you start a search it tells you how many entries and it says if you want this hit return if you don't hit another key just you  have gotta got to say  wow
