 ya  whereas now it's much more acceptable for people to change  careers at anytime  oh ya   go to school at anytime of life  people don't look at you like you're   you're nuts  right   ya but some jobs are becoming obsolete too  people don't have a choice huh  exactly   that's probably for sure  and then a lot of women are you know going back after they have their kids  oh ya and changing word  that's right   ya  whereas before they didn't really have the opportunity  that's right  and it it's really it is more or less the opportunity and being becoming more acceptable  right right   yup  so it's a different changing world   ya  and people are getting older too  that's true  living longer   and living longer  and they're not   wanting to do more things huh  exactly  it used to be sixty-five years old and you sat in your rocking chair  that's right laugh   or at least that's what we thought they did anyway  ya ya   and now oh my gosh they just s  start living  exactly   they travel  i mean my mother is seventy-six years old   and she is the tour leader   of the seniors   two words   mhh hmm   is that right   oh you're kidding   you're kidding   i'm not  she leads them on trips  really   ya  she takes trips  she takes them to florida in the winter  oh i should maybe find out about that because maybe my mom could go   if your mom is doing that kind of thing  because my mom she needs to meet some people  like older people to go traveling with  to definitely not 'you' mean to go on the trip or be on   but she she isn't here   to go on a trip   your mother isn't here  she could   no but i'd bring her here laugh you know if i knew of something like that  i'm sure she'd have a ball   it is the most fabulous fabulous  thing that you could  mhh hmm   it's fabulous  they go they have the greatest trips  the day trips  two day trips a week   ya   trips everywhere  they've all  and my mother has gone to terrific places  right   she was during in in  the summer she's gone to saratoga or something for a day or two  great   uh huh  they go to plays  the pigory   right  oh okay okay  i'm trying to think of  but do they go for like a week or two weeks or something like that   yes they go for a week   they go to washington  oh they go for a month to florida  ya   really  you have a choice a month two months   or  three months to florida  because something like that would be excellent for my mom    ya   you have they have  different options   ohh okay   they go to arizona   for a month   right   really   okay  oh well i should get some information from you about that  two words ohh it's  your mom must have a lot of brochures and things  it's   ya   uh huh  or  and upcoming trips that you're word    upcoming trips   i could tell you all the upcoming trips  ya  it's really  that would make like a good christmas present or something like that you know  but she'd have to come here  ya she'd have to come here  to go with this particular group  that's okay   she could come here   i'm sure they have seniors' groups  where she is  ya i know but s she     but she wouldn't go unless you gave her the ticket  that's right  you know and i i really think you know  she she wouldn't do it on her own  right  she needs to have somebody organize it for her  mhh hmm  and i think if i organized it for her then she would probably do it  thats right  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  you know she's not really much of a person for doing it on  her own   mhh hmm mhh hmm  you know she she has no experience at doing that kind of stuff right  mhh hmm   so uhm   that's great because well the trip is all   organized and you go with all you know  types of people and   gee   you know  ya you meet different people and   you meet different people  they take you to show  that's right   i mean it's all   ya my mom needs to have something that's organized  so that you know she doesn't become confused or you know she can just  go and have a good time   and and they look after you and  so   right   absolutely   and they look after you   my mother's the one who looks after the seniors  that's right   my mother's the   phrase   ya ya ya   but see this would be a great role model for my mom you know laugh   oh you should see her   i told her i wanna want to grow up to be just like her  i bet   gee  she sounds great  mhh hmm  wow  so she ya   actually she's doing something at concordia montreal university now  really  ya  they came  i can't remember where they came to  maybe the one of her golden ager things  ya  see at this place the golden ager thing where they have  this trip they have other things too  uh huh   okay  they have bridge lessons and  besides trips  this is just one section  mhh hmm   they have bridge lessons and art lessons and  mhh hmm   all kinds of   you name it   you name it  mhh hmm   you can go everyday and participate in some kind of ah an activity and meet people  it is  talking a about   you know we were talking about seniors sitting  home in their rocking chair  right   mhh hmm   right right  i mean it's phenomenal  ya   anyway they tr at concordia  they tr they were some people were trying to organize ah  some sort of a conference on how to get seniors to volunteer  mhh hmm   oh okay  so my mother   mhh hmm   they asked her if she'd like to participate  two words laugh   so she volunteered   to be on this committee and to figure out to  discuss   ya   right   it's like a think tank  ya  gee  so she goes once a week here  and they plan  they decide what they should do  who they should send the brochures to  should they get or the radio programs  uh huh   you know how should they reach the seniors   right   how should they get the seniors to know  that's right   if like your mother if you were to tell your mother you know if you wanted you could come once a week and help in the cafeteria  maybe she could do that   that's right   she could serve the soup or  something   that's right   right right  would you like to volunteer and and   serve you know   mhh hmm   people do that  right right  and that makes you come every day  it's more challenge word meet  people  that's right that's right   maybe you'll sit down after and have coffee with somebody that you   that's right  ya  so how do you figure out  how do you get the seniors to find out about what they can volunteer in and  right right  my mother's amazing  she goes bowling once a week  she plays bridge once a week  she plays cards one night a week  sh   plus she goes to this golden ager the tour and travel that she works at this   ya   well i'm interested in this tour and travel because i would really like my mom to go on a nice trip and meet people you know like older people around her  own age and do things with them and you know do things with them and you know be kind of looked after  phrase   right ?  because she's she's  not used to it  mhh hmm   she uh   they really are looked after  ya  cos i took her to hawaii with me once uh  with michael and i  we went together  wow  but for her i don't think it was that much fun  no  because it was like we were babysitting her kind of thing  that's right   no she would rather be people with people    she would rather be with i think a   a big group of people and be able to talk to a lots of   people and have some fun and dance and  i don't know play uh  cards or you know whatever they do  absolutely   of course   ya   mhh hmm  but with us it was kind of like  and and she even told me she  kinda kind of felt like she was a third wheel  you know me  absolutely   i i don't blame her  you know   and it's and it's it's it's  normal  it's it's word    even though we we  did what we what we could to make her feel  good   i know but   you know we went out for dinner and  little tours and stuff you know but   it isn't even anybody's fault  you should be with your own friends  ya  i don't wanna want to go with my  mother even though my mother's terrific  ya   i don't want her her i don't want to go with her   ya   i don't want her to come with me  right  let her go with her friends and i go with my friends  right   and that's the way it's supposed to be  exactly   as a matter of fact i have a friend who brings her mother everywhere with her  oh no laugh   so there you go you know   ya   we don't like  like the people we go out for supper six   coup couples   three couples or whatever and she   her mother comes  all the time  no   mhh   really   and all everyone says you know rolling the eyes and   two words no she's bringing her mother  oh ya   and then i tell myself like why does it bother me  uh huh   i i we have discussed this with  myself   uh huh   oh i see  okay  right  right  when you think about it logically why  why does it bother me  i don't care if she brings her mother really when you think about it   really ya   why should i care  mhh hmm  but you know what people don't li   like the other couples don't like it  the other couples don't like it either  no no   it's not just you  it isn't just me  nobody likes it  no   and i know  i've discussed it with some of the others  they don't even know why they don't like it  why   you know you don't mind if you bring your mother once  ya sometimes or once in a while   and she's word nice   or whatever  ya   i i can't still can't put it i can't verbalize what it is that bothers me  they word you have to be with your own friends   ya  she's nice   well i think there's something in that  you know that you know you you   and i don't want her with us  ya  i i don't wanna  want to talk to her  maybe that's another thing  i wanna want to talk to my friends so  she'll sit if she sits beside i end up having to talk to her and i don't really have that much in common with her  maybe that's   maybe you don't know her really  i do  you know your friends  i do know her   oh you do  oh okay   she comes with us all the time  oh laugh okay  but i don't but   but maybe she's not your choice of a friend  that's it  exactly  hmm ya maybe   that must be it   ya  but it's interesting  so even you know you talk about you try to  make her f you know your mother feel comfortable and  here her daughter tries to make her part of the group part  right   ya   she's not part of the group  no no  no because when we went to  hawaii you know i i  felt ya she didn't feel   that comfortable   i have   it's   i'm going to have my   my supper   oh ya go ahead   ya go ahead  no  but she didn't feel that comfortable   no   and then you know my husband you know he kind of said well you know next time we're not going to laugh take your mother
