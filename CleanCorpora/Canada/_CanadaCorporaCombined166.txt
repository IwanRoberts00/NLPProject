 cough when did you first study to become a psychiatrist doctor featherstone   uh psychiatrist  yes  uh nineteen ninety- uhm three  uh what month in nineteen ninety-three  june  so you've been a psychiatrist and qualified to practice as such in canada for slightly over two years  is that correct  yes  two and a quarter   a few words precise about it so  word what day in june did you become a psychiatrist  uh june thirtieth  june thirtieth  so uh you've been word practicing psychiatrist for two years two months  correct  correct  and uhm do you have any other teaching positions that you currently hold  uh no  the  uh well this is  ya uh kind of  i do do some teaching at tango shoe hospital at salsa  i used to do some teaching at the glengarry general hospital  what did you teach uh at the hospital in salsa   in the hospital  uh nursing students and uh the occasional family physician comes through  so you don't teach at the medical school in the department of psychiatry or in the medical college  not at tango shoe hospital salsa   i have done at the university of glengarry in uh  glengarry   what specifically did you teach there  uh medical skudent students psychiatry students nursing students  what did you teach them  uh psychiatry and forensic psychiatry  do you currently hold such a position  sorry  do you currently hold any teaching positions   no i do not  have you published any articles  uh none that are relevant to this area  but have you published any articles  way back when in nineteen eighty-eight on fertilization  so in terms of the psychiatrist you haven't  published any articles in the since you've uh been qualified as a psychiatrist  that's correct   cough and you currently uh work for a uh consulting company i gather  is that   that's correct  that's your own business  uh not mine but i work for it  okay so this is a you're one of the   psychiatrists employed at this company  that's correct  and uh the prime uhh part of your employment i guess as you've described already is to provide consulting services and expert testimony in various areas  is that what i understand that you're saying  you maybe two words   i wouldn't say my primary is to provide expert testimony  my primary area is to prevent uh to provide   forensic services in the assessment and treatment of uh individuals involved with certain criminal aspects of the justice system  uh certainly some of that work does entail being an expert witness uh but i wouldn't say the main focus was to be an expert witness  but you have been an expert witness some two hundred  sixty to two hundred and seventy times as i understand  uh that's correct  uhm the vast majority of those were done as i was   when i was with the university of glengarry in a teaching position  are you saying you testified in court two hundred sixty or two hundred and seventy times  is that what word   that's correct  and over what period of time have you done that  over the years nineteen ninety uh two roughly ninety-one ninety-two  somewhere in there uh word time  okay so some of that is prior to your becoming a qualified psychiatrist  that's correct  so how many times have you testified in court as a qualified psychiatrist  oh probably about half of that  a hundred and uh forty a hundred and thirty times something like that   approximately   so that's in the last uh two years two months  yes   and uh so that strikes me as as   taking up a fair bit of your time if you're testifying in court uh  that's almost every week  a few words   it does take it does take   a lot of time  that's correct  and uh i understood you say seventy or eighty percent of your work then relates to that either providing a consulting service and you're actually testifying in court   or or treating assessment and treating  well do you actually treat any  do you have any patients that you actually treat on an ongoing basis at this time  i i have a large caseload  and so you do that  you testify in court more than once a week on average and you provide consulting services  and that's sort of your practice  at the current time uh my cor court  time is actually reduced from what it was and i'm probably testifying maybe once every three or four weeks  come on  let's take this week for example  how many times have you been in court this week  it's been an exceptional week  i've been in court twice this week including today  and in terms of uhm your background material you said that you uhm have outlined in your report  a few words second page or first page of it i  think   uh the database   ya  the chart you looked at before you met with  mister rabbitfoot or in connection with the karen  report   that's outlined there   uhh i think so  yes  is there anything else that you did use or references that you did have that's not outlined in that database section  in regards to the written report itself  yup  uh other than my general knowledge and uh experience and uh uh i may have referred to a textbook uhm but i can't recall specifically  about it or not  okay  did you review the r t d file on mister rabbitfoot  i believe i did  okay  uhm is that referred to the item word    r c   r c m p royal canadian mounted police identification sheet criminal record  okay i'm talking about the r t d   sorry  i must i must   i'm sorry  the regional though-helping depot is what we here call the r t or the r t d   yes   they did you review their file  no i don't believe i did  and is there a reason you didn't do that  i couldn't i didn't have access to it  did you contact doctor ping to get access to that file  uhh no i i spoke with uh mister  bigman   and he told you that you did could  not have access to that file  i don't know if he told me i couldn't  we spoke and discussed the matter and i subsequently didn't see the file  uh i don't know if it was a matter of of   whether i couldn't or not  all i'm saying is that i didn't see it  i didn't have access to it  okay  so whether you could have had access or not you don't know  you chose not to follow up on that  i left it with mister bigman   okay  and he never at any time provided the r t d file  that's correct  uh would you think that something like that would be helpful in trying to assess a patient  it would be  uhm did you review any other medical file aside from the one dealing with suicide attempts  uhm uh uh i can't be sure  uhh there mi biz there might have been a a file a   a record on the the nasal surgery he had but i i'd stick that under tango shoe hospital word far far away  city hospital records i think   word   that's really not word i guess then  right   uhm so in terms of what ah diagnosis or what assessment  was made by psychiatrists who were treating mister rabbitfoot back in february uh when he was at the r t d you have no idea about that then  i wouldn't say i have no idea  certainly i did not look at the records or hear what the records  have to say   well what assessment did they make of him at that time then  well uhm uhm i haven't had access to the records  so i take it then it's it's fair to say you have no idea of what they assessed of him at that time  well i'm saying doctor tevees commented on uhh anti-social personality disorder and i can't remember if he commented on depression or not  will you tell me what the doctors or the psychiatrists who treated mister rabbitfoot in february of this year assessed him at according to what you know  sorry  two words question   can you tell the court what the psychiatrists at the regional though-helping depot r t d is what we call it so just so you know what we're talking about  here   ya ya   sure   what was their assessment of mister rabbitfoot  february of this year  other than what doctor tevees </@ cos i didn't have access to their rec ords i don't know   uhm well what did doctor tevees say about that  i think he commented on uhh anti-social personality disorder and i can't recall or not if he  can you show me in the report where he said that mister  rabbitfoot was diagnosed with having anti-social personality by   mumbles   i didn't see that myself but i sometimes i   miss things  i may have been mistaken  it may have word doctor  bondarychuk that i spoke to of course the a few words    you haven't had a lot of time to study those two reports have you  i've read them both through  just last night  correct  so you haven't had a lot of time to look through them think about them or  these particular reports  ya  they're fairly short uh but i honestly haven't memorized every word or every detail in in the two  reports   well you you show me  in their words ah what the the   diagnosis was in february of this year  sure   sure long pause while reading   uh uhh page three paragraphs three and some word  underneath that in actual fact that's incorrect  the word depr uh the word depression  word is referring to the meyertown   remand centre  however the regional though-helping depot uh specifies in regards to the diagnosis at that time which i presume is referring to r t d two or three words all the same paragraph uh uh comments on word abuse  disorder adjustment disorder with depressive mood an   anti - social personality disorder  okay  so there's no diagnosis of any major depression at that time  right  there's a diagnosis of a of ah  adjustment disorder with depressive mood mood   and i did state i wasn't sure whether a diagnosis of major depression had been made or not  okay  i'll just ask you again  based on what that report says you agree with me there's no diagnosis of major depression at that time  correct  because that would show up under axis one and major depression is a particular diagnosis with criminal two words  correct  and would you agree with me that uh psychiatrists who are actually dealing with a patient and treating him at that time are probably in a better position to uh make an assessment than someone who comes in several months after the fact  i would concur  what's kind of puzzling is that he remain on elavil  looks like a hundred and fifty milligrams which is a treatment for major depression   are you saying that's the only time that medication can be prescribed  at that sort of dose that would be the medical indication for prescribing such a medication  well you're not saying that that's the only reason  the only thing you've ever prescribed elavil for is major depression are you  i would prescribe it for uh chronic pain fibromyalgia  uhm usually the dosage is fifty to seventy-five sometimes a hundred milligrams  uh this would be an unusual dose to be used in anything but uh suspected major depression or for confirmed major depression  so i guess you agree with me that that is not the only thing you can prescribe that medication for would you   there are other things besides major depression that it's used for  certainly  so i think you said this morning you thought it would be unethical for a doctor to prescribe that medication for anything other than major depression  maybe i misunderstood you  i uh   well that's that's  not true then  you may have misunderstood me  i i believe i stated that i have serious concerns about a doctor prescribing that kind of medication to someone with a substance abuse problem who doesn't have major depression  that medication is also used to control symptoms like uh anxiety or aggressiveness or things of that sort is it not
