 well i i got back in  got some of this uh sierra online which you should buy  right   it's good stock  they make the king's quest and all these other things  what's that   oh right right   and it's been going up a lar   large   it went up uh ten bucks last week in one day from like   twenty-four dollars to thirty-four dollars  oh that's okay   tech stocks are really taking a hit today though  well ya  i b m was down about another four points  and i didn't check daq but we could  i own uh one called zyquest   uhm they make these uh removable uhm floppy drives basically  they're a hundred and twe twenty  a hundred and thirty-five megabyte floppies  it's canadian  no it's american  uh huh  it's on the nasdaq  uhm but there's two of them  there's iomega and zyquest and iomega i owned for awhile  tripled my money on it   floppy disks that you put into here and   look through it and five and a half   and they're a hund hundred   and thirty five or three and a or three and a quarter or three and a half inch ya and they're a hundred and thirty-five megabytes  so you could put everything on there  exactly   how much is one diskette though  uhm one diskette's around twenty dollars or so  that's pretty cheap   something l like   i i mean it's per per  megabyte that's pretty cheap  ya   that's pretty cheap eh especially if you  wanna want to put anything on there  exactly   word it's a lot faster to load and about four words   there's a it it's ah almost as fast as a hard drive too is the nice thing  uhm the  so it's th the disk drive  or a few words it needs a different   ya it it would look it looks  almost exactly like that   you need to change these the drives as well as there's special diskettes that you get   well ya like you would get  ya exactly   so how much does each diskette go for then   well that's that's   twenty about twenty dollars or so i think  the whole drive eh costs three hundred and fifty i think for the internal  uh huh  and it and it looks just  like a like that drive basically when you install it  but the special disks for it are twenty bucks twenty-five and it may store a hundred and thirty-five megabytes  there's another competitor though iomega  which whose stock is doing amazingly well  mhh hmm   where does it trade the daq   it's also on nasdaq  ah   uhm see the problem with zyquest is they have the better product but they're they got some yahoo running it and they're in financial troubles even though  it's the better product and iomega's  doing better   mhh hmm   so dow jones is really roller-coastering it today cos it was

two or three sections and then we can go from there i guess  okay   uhm so i'll get a copy of that and i will  photocopy those two articles for you and should be able to get them over today  okay great  so let's let's do that and  put an end to it  right   just taking a quick look through these uhm a lot of the stuff is badly outdated or one-sided or doesn't tell you that much about riel  so it's uh not really useful   no   and some of it like there's one i just wrote down  junk beside it  it's uh uhh le r&eacute;cit essentiel de l'histoire du quebec by laurent belanger who taught here  it was a huge selling book  uh it sold i forget how many hundred thousand copies but it was absolute crap  major errors of of fact in every paragraph  guy doesn't know what he was talking about  no  is that uh uh from a nationalist standpoint or something  but   it was kind of nationalist uhm socialist revolutionary   and he wrote history the way it should have happened in his view  not not the way it did happen and it's  it's not very good  oh ya   the uh one of the problems is that everybody who studies riel sees a different person  and what happens is you know people have their own agendas  uh and so they want to see riel as what they want to see  mhh hmm   so for the protestants of ontario for example   whose view was that the french and the m&eacute;tis everybody else had no right to be in the west then the thing to do  obviously riel was a villain   mhh   and uh so one of the first ones they get is the man who had to hang history by e.b. osler and it comes out  that uh cough in that history louis riel hangs scott because scott had won the heart of a woman that riel loved  which is pure nonsense  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   no such thing ever happened uhm  ah uh that's funny  you know in in in uh that's actually mentioned in  the this book that i had the the little green one from ah an unknown author  ya   that's probably the one  ya it's  by osler  ya  ya you get that  you get  uhm generally speaking english-speaking protestants saw him as a villain cos he's expanding word canada's westward plans in making the west english and protestant so he's a villain  mhh hmm  ehm among the french quebecois he becomes a hero  and and the peculiar thing is they did not consider him a hero in eighteen seventy  they didn't consider him a hero in eighteen eighty-five   well because stanley actually says that he  he got a lot of support from quebec  not not right away  nobody goes out to help him  there's no speeches in the house of commons for him  there's no rallies   when when they come over to riel  and you know  and and and and lately quebec nationalists talk about how quebec was always attached to him how he was fighting to build a french nation on the plains  ya   he was not fighting to do any such thing  no  french quebec would have been as big an enemy to him as english ontario  but he gets translated into this guy   and the tr translation   the moment of translation comes not in eighteen eighty-five it's eighteen eighty-seven   in eighteen eighty-seven the court hangs him  mhh hmm  and the reason they hang him is not because he was a rebel   it's because he killed scott and he was a french   cat catholic french-speaking catholic   in the view of english canada this was a warning to french quebec to stay in its place  mhh hmm  that's the point at which french quebec reacts   and embraces him  mhh hmm   that's when you have rallies in montreal and you have laurier  saying you know if i had been on the plains i would have shouldered a musket to fight with louis riel   well nothing was stopping him from doing it  he didn't do it  mhh hmm  it's eighteen eighty-seven with the execution   uh and then you get westerners most of them the decendents of the english protestants who hated riel they suddenly in the last thirty years began to see him as a hero because they hate the east and he's the symbol of westerns who   ya they were being ripped off by the railroad and everything   ya   ya   and then he gets picked up by the unions because they see him as the symbol of the working man struggling against big business  he wasn't a unionized working man  he wasn't a socialist nor was he particularly interested in big business one way or the other  mhh   they all invent this hero  he becomes a hero to the indians cos they perceive him as the native fighting against  and and he becomes perceived as  as by natives and m&egrave;tis generally as the man who was fighting for them   and they perhaps are a little bit closer to the truth  but he becomes   mhh  he is it does have a certain resonance with the with them you know like   maybe two words   he is the all-purpose hero or the all-purpose villain depending on where you're starting and that's what makes him such a central figure in canadian history  but what gets lost is precisely what you're doing what was it that riel was asking   it's the simplicity of it i guess
