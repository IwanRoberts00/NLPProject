 thank you my lord  ladies and gentlemen i as i i'd mentioned earlier when i made my opening remarks that i'd later on have a chance to speak with you in a little more detail   that's obviously what i'm going to do now   mister phelan had raised a number of points and i quite frankly don't intend to go over them all again   what i did want to do is kind of give you one comment he had made  during my summation to you i too will be referring to evidence  i'm going to be referring to evidence that i recollect being said that i think is important based on what i want to speak to you about  and i just want to raise the same points he did  it's that you're the ones who determine what the evidence is   not me   not the judge   it's you   and if i say anything that you don't recall you win  i don't want you misinterpret what i'm saying now word  because the way this case started i believe we definitely gave you council's remarks they're not evidence and this is not evidence  when the trial started the judge told you you would hear the evidence  you would then hear the summation  what's going to happen now is that i'm going to go over  evidence that i think is important  i'm going to speak to you about my client herbert   when i'm finished doing that both mister lebouf and mister lister will have the opportunity to address you  then mister rawls on behalf of the crown will have the opportunity to address you  and ultimately the judge will give you some instructions   what i'd ask at this time is that you just give me maybe ten or fifteen minutes of your attention while i go over things that i feel are important on behalf of herbert wasylesko   i want to reinforce just a couple of points that mister phelan  had made when he was standing chatting with you  the first one is that herbert wasylesko is an innocent man unless and until you say otherwise  point number one  you have to be satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt  the second point that mister phelan made and i want to come back to my client has absolutely no onus to establish to you  throughout this case the crown bears the onus of proving  herbert wasylesko 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt   i'd like to really get into what what  i suggest maybe three words ladies and gentlemen   not one of the witnesses that you have heard over the last two weeks have stated that they saw herbert wasylesko kick or strike raoul eto   now i point out to you  this is another reason i'll be summing up shorter i anticipate than my friend  simply this  my client faces one charge   the charge of raoul eto and in that assault bodily harm was caused  that's the case in a nutshell  the judge will go into more detail with you  my client is really only concerned with raoul eto    and none of the witnesses not even the crown witnesses   the crown bears the onus of proof  none of them have been able to say they saw herbert wasylesko  do what he's charged with  what has been established i suggest and is accepted by the crown witnesses is that there were a lot of people present throughout that evening apart from the employees and there was a lot of alcohol being involved   mister phelan pointed out the obvious   there's no evidence a few words   they were there doing their job   you've heard a number of witnesses over the last two weeks  and i certainly don't intend to review everything they've said  as i mentioned my client faces one count  if i were to review all the evidence in two weeks i might be here two weeks doing it   but i do want to touch briefly on the evidence of some of the witnesses kind of separate the wheat from the chaff as it were for your consideration   in doing this i've decided to kind of break this whole thing down into what i call four separate occurrences  you've heard evidence about the initial fight at the  washroom area   the next thing you heard was about an incident at the coat check area kind of at the front door  third thing is the situation on granada avenue after mister eto left the fire and ran away  the fourth area is the detention in the hallway  and i think in fairness that may be a good way to look at this case if i go through it on behalf of herbert and deal with each of those areas  i want to start of course with the disturbance at the washroom  now you'll recall herbert wasylesko took the stand  and his evidence was that he was at the front door area taking the cover charge when he heard about this initial skirmish   he said he came partly down the hall  he was following his brother frank   saw matters were under control and at that point returned to his duties  now ronald craw confirmed the scuffle by the washroom  but i believe he said he couldn't see anything  there was a crowd of people around   wanda palmer you recall testified about this initial scuffle   wanda wisha said much the same as mister silverman  said  mister eto himself confirms that  and although he did state he didn't recall being involved in a fight with a person he had pulled off i believe he does state that his mouth  was was bleeding at that time   finally we have frank wasylesko and johnny steen  saying that they brought mister eto up towards the coat check area and i believe herbert wasylesko said basically the same thing  so i suggest that there's absolutely no evidence  absolutely nothing that connects my client herbert with anything in that initial skirmish  i don't intend to talk about it anymore   second one the incident by the coat check  i think it's fairly clear that something occurred there  we've had different stories from different people but virtually all the witnesses that i just referred to confirm that there was something that went on at the coat check area  i don't think that's in dispute  mister avalon the manager you recall he was very clear in stating that when he came upon this he didn't see the beginning of it  when he came upon it there was herbert wasylesko holding an individual two words   if you put the evidence together that individual was mister  raoul eto   i believe mister avalon also indicated that he heard  herbert say to this person just relax just settle down  that there was no real fight there  it was just mister herbert wasylesko loosely holding  a few words mister eto   i suggest to you ladies and gentlemen what we have there is simply this herbert doing his job doing what's required of him doing nothing more nothing less  there's no evidence there of herbert wasylesko  threatening or intimidating mister eto   there's no evidence of herbert wasylesko being angry  there's no evidence of herbert wasylesko doing any violence whatsoever  i'm going to come back to that   but as far as that second incident goes again i suggest that there's absolutely nothing here to suggest that herbert wasylesko  was in any way dealing with a few words   i don't intend to go further than that   the third area is i guess we'll all refer to it as the outside incident   there's certainly no doubt that herbert wasylesko was the individual involved in apprehending mister eto but i'd like you to consider the following evidence from the following witnesses  they all admit some very important things   number one they do tend to acknowledge that it's quite possible that there were five or six people chasing after mister eto   i believe he also stated not all those people were doormen   in fact i believe he specifically stated there were some other people involved who were not doormen  i'd ask you to think carefully on that evidence when you're make your deliberations   we've then got mister hawker   mister hawker referred to a bunch of guys going after raoul eto   mister lister inferred there was a major commotion with lots of people around and it was possible six people went after mister eto   colleen paska i believe her evidence word  was that she kind of went outside with the flow of people  a few words   she did state there were a number of people outside   then we come to ronald craw   now ronald craw said there were at least four or five people who went out the door   and although herbert wasylesko was sitting in this courtroom in open trial mister craw did not identify him as one of the individuals he saw kicking mister eto   he did state the individual had dark word   the evidence says mister herbert wasylesko was wearing a white t-shirt   now mister phelan had spoken briefly of inferences  and i'd like you to think of this   herbert wasylesko according to the evidence of himself and mister avalon and i believe frank was at the front door taking cover charges that evening   mister craw came in i suggest that mister  herbert wasylesko had mister craw to deal with as he came in  how could he not  and yet a few hours later mister craw is not able to say herbert wasylesko was ultimately doing anything to mister  eto   obviously mister herbert wasylesko completely denies it  that's fine then because mister craw is one of those witnesses who wasn't as drunk as the rest of the crowd was  i suggest to you the reason he didn't identify mister  herbert wasylesko as kicking mister eto is because mister  herbert wasylesko was not kicking mister eto   the last thing with mister craw is actually  to look at is this common because i believe he said when he was out in the street he heard a lot of yelling about a knife   the knife was a concern  mister craw knew the knife was a concern  that's why then a few words other people  word   mister avalon again another crown witness his evidence was that he heard people on the street   goes around the corner  he saw john steen on the ground struggling with raoul eto   he saw herbert wasylesko standing there  he saw someone else there whom i believe he just  just couldn't identify that person   and he also referred to a crowd of people  and i ask you to go back in your memories and  and recall what he said  i thought that his indication was that there were about ten people outside when he went out there  so we've obviously got a fairly large crowd of people around mister eto   mister avalon also said that he saw herbert wasylesko  hold the knife   he then saw mister herbert wasylesko assist john steen in getting raoul eto to his word   bringing him back into the building  fred avalon also said a little bit later that evening this is as i understand the evidence just shortly after all of this  charles montebank goes into his office  now john steen is definitely placing charles montebank out there as well as herbert wasylesko   and then raoul eto   raoul eto 's word was that there were he used the words a lot of guys there when he was talking about this thing on granada avenue   and then he heard comments regarding them looking  for the knife  and i believe he further stated that people were  hitting me and kicking me and looking for the knife   this knife is important obviously  mister craw knows it's out there  raoul eto himself has given evidence indicating that people were looking hard for the knife   herbert wasylesko has got on the stand and he has told you what his involvement was on the street   ladies and gentlemen i ask you to just think about this  herbert wasylesko went out the door   there's lots of word out the door yelling about a knife  herbert wasylesko himself goes out the door  why does he go out the door  to find the knife   he did find the knife   we've got witnesses who say that herbert wasylesko had the knife
