relationship  you have your ups and your downs  it's not perfect  ya  god if i meet the perfect woman i'll feel too intimidated  laugh   i don't know what the hell i'd do  i don't think i've ever had

held my hand she kinda kind of   dug her nails in my  laugh it's all getting in into this now are we  laugh we've gone from the uh pathetic stage to the relationship stage to the s and m stage laugh is that what this is  no it was like i'm angry at what i see at the screen so i'll not " i'm" going to vent it on my boyfriend   laugh oh i see  that's the stage  laugh whew jeez  ya that was that was kind of a brutal movie  that was a little bit worse than rob roy   ya  ya it was   i word it was  laugh   laugh well well   rob roy tended to show it it it wasn't so gruesome or so hard  i mean a a lot of the killing in there was totally without mercy and i think they showed that to show  that like the king's lack of feeling and desire for power but uh the uhm  but did you think that some of the stuff were   was unnecessary  oh definitely but that was typical of the times   it was set in   no no i mean in the movie to show it  to show it   ya   yes well yes and no  like to see to see like he rides in to one of the nobleman's ah whatever his  house and crushes his head with an  nuh you know they dint  didn't necessarily had to show that  mhhm   mhhm   mhhm   you know   ya   they could have just like they didn't have to show him  getting his head words   yeah they could've shown him swinging and then like a a thud or him running out of the building or whatever  uh ya but see that that's that's   certainly is more realistic you know  true i don't know   but uh ya it was a little bit much i thought  like the disemboweling the whole bit was rather gruesome  you know what i think   ya  holy cow   you know what i think  hmm  i think they wanted to make this film an epic  yes ya   see two hours it's a movie  three hours it's an epic   laugh but it was good  i uh the story was good and  it was  i liked it words   it was historical i called it historical  hmm  well anne didn't like it very much  oh really  oh jeez  she said   she should see rob roy cos that's a lot better  it's a lot more about love all that  she'd love that  ya i'd ya   laugh this this kind of the romance left and ya you're right then it was an epic  ya   it was like it kinda kind of  was   slaughter   it kinda kind of  jus just didn't it kind of mislead you   the uh the trailer  a bit yes ya cos initially and in  the first part of the movie the whole bit i was like he's   gonna going to grow up to be a noble guy he's  gonna going to save his girl and  the whole bit you know  oh no   ah right   but his girl gets killed and then man i was totally shocked  i was like   that's it  ya  he only got to you know the romantic word  once laugh   laugh but once was enough and with the queen let me say laugh   and once was enough to shall i say hit the bull's eye   laugh   laugh ew this is good  what uh but ya the the  romantic interest disappears initially  and the rest of it's kind of i don't know it didn't  it had a bit to do with freedom but it laugh was more one man's vendetta against the world two words  and taking out his rage on his lost love and it's kinda kind of   and had to use sticks and spears and axes   ya laugh no no  well i i lost a little kind of respect for him as a what i would've would have  thought a hero because he wasn't you know after a point it wasn't vengeance anymore you know  he he killed the guy who killed his girl that was kinda kind of revenge and   you know  ya   but after that it was this man's rage and his   two words fight   no but he wanted freedom for his people  even that didn't you know ahh i don't know i guess i'm comparing it to rob roy cos there was a he was much more noble quest for freedom   ya but rob roy is a fictitious character isn't he   yes but you know  of course you're gonna going to   word it's an epic a historical movie of real life happenings  laugh ya ya i guess   i don't know  rob roy the only thing i s  saw the only thing i saw in rob roy that turned me off was this big chested man  behind a tree kissing this woman and it just reminded me of those what are those romance novels those  harlequin it was a straight  cover of harlequin   mhhm   mhhm   harlequin laugh   laugh   okay this movie will be like a harlequin romance  and i was like forget it  laugh   oh no it wasn't actually  eh uh the romance was well done  and the whole nudity whatever  laugh nudity ha no it was pretty it was pretty sensitive i mean it was you know i don't know  what can i say  the villain was great  holy cow by the end of the movie you were hating the bastard  why   laugh it was like ya ya kill him roar  cheering   it was good  it was really pleasing  he was a total prick laugh jeez  even in real life like uh it's just his look and his manners  if these are his real life manners boy i couldn't stand the guy  laugh   laugh   even if he was a like a laugh  frankly if he was a priest laugh i'd   change religions   no     that's what that's what makes a good actor is   ya   hi i'm here to play the annoying prick  alright hire him  laugh jeez word world    hi   laugh never thought of it quite like that   i don't know we'll see about this waterworld crap laugh   by kevin with kevin costner   i kinda kind of/+> want
