movie i saw was the first one  i never saw any of the fo  following of the later ones   michelle pfeiffer was in the second one and she was quite good   ya she was supposed to be very good  ya she was pretty good  but i uh just got tired of the first one after hearing uhm  uh kim basinger squawk all the time   screech screech screech  it does get annoying  hey that's alanis   which song is this briefly music starts: " you oughta know" by alanis morissette   i love this song actually   we're not supposed to put it on the stuff when we're doing this  uhm it never really said but uhm  ah probably can't hear that  it's in the background   partial phrase   she grew up in ottawa eh didn't she   ya   uh i word was she born here    i think so  i think she went to   i have her first album you know  i don't know where she went to  somewhere in the sort of east end  i have her first album  do you  the pop one  do you  used to play it all the time  did you   that was in my pop days before i became cultured and listened to gys gypsy music instead  oh i gave uhm maria my gypsy uhm music the uhm latcho drom  and she she actually had seen the movie  uhm she saw it in montreal though  uh huh   oh  and uhm she   she likes it though does she   ya she likes it  she uhm asked me if she could tape it so i said ya no problem cos i'm taping some of her stuff  that music will be passed around a lot  it's great because uhm she's so well rounded in her interests that uhm   like you know she has stuiff  like if i express an interest in something like cooking then often you know she may able give me tips or uhm  like she had that book that i wanted on uhm uhm uhm history   of print of print making  mhh hmm  which is so exciting eh   laugh   from gypsy music to the history of print making  this   what is this  this like early rockets or something   i guess laugh   well but they're  well it can't be because they're on a rope laugh   laugh   they pulling it up with a rope   it's kinda kind of  funny it's kind of funny watching it without   sound laugh eh   ya   i i love the bow ties  actually did i tell you like uhm when that fellow came in uhm  uhm to tell us about security and he was from the canadian security service  cough   which is really neat   c sis canadian security intelligence service   c sis ya   ya   and he laugh he's wearing this big bow tie  he was kind of funny a   you don't see bow ties too much  anymore   no  and he wasn't like that old  like sometimes you'll see them in in  really more elderly type of men  but this guy was maybe in in his  uhm late forties or early fifties  so it was kind of unusual  mhh hmm  is a play button supposed to be on when the record button's on  i guess so eh  uhm we're just supposed to press record  ya  that's all we did i guess eh   ya so  if we if we screwed up this after forty-five minutes then heads are gonna going to  roll 10 sec pause   oh this is uhm uhm when we shrunk the kids misstated title: honey i shrunk the kids   ya   what was it i said last night  raiders laugh of the the third kind laugh    laugh raiders of the first kind   that would be raiders of the lost ark  i loved that movie  that was the best 15 sec. pause   which raiders of the lost ark or close encounters of the third time or some sort of mutant hybrid of the two   laugh   both of them i loved actually  well i just loved it  and i still love uhm uhm close encounters just because it was so different  like even now it's kind of different  like uhm most alien movies from around that time i think you know aliens were sort of the bad guys and stuff like that  mhh hmm   and this one it sort of started out you thought they were bad guys but they weren't   mhh hmm   basketball that's so exciting   i uhh ya i liked it  uhm   i liked it a lot  it was a good movie  what was i gonna going to say  word raiders   oh i wish i wish we got t b s turner broadcasting system here cos they have good movies on some time   i know   my parents get that   they got good stuff  and they play like braves games and stuff and   word laugh you know what i'd like  i'd like one of those super   huh   huh  maybe two words   no almost   laugh   uhm what was i gonna going to say  i dunno don't know   i'd like one of those huge huge screen t vs   and and i'd like a satellite dish and like a great big v c r  ya   laugh i don't suppose the size of the   v c r matters eh   laugh a great big v c r  laugh   a huge v c r that can play a huge tape   laugh ya   mhh  do girls i wonder if girls still learn baton twirling  uhh   i guess they have to for the head of parades  laugh otherwise what would they do with the   at the head of parades  my sister learned baton twirling  did she  she did   i learned ballet and i was no good at it 10 sec. pause  right on   you would have been a football player at one time wouldn't you   can you tell by the thirty - two inch neck  he's got no   i was gonna going to say he's got no neck 10 sec. pause   can you do exercises that make your neck bigger  uhm ya and i think those guys when   they they're tend to be sort of squat guys anyways  ya   and when they do uh bench presses and things it builds up their neck as well  it looks gross   i mean you sort of strain your neck anyways when   you're doing stuff like you're going like that   my dad used to play football  did he  mhh hmm 7 sec. pause   when he was at appleby   where  in appleby  well it was a private boys' school he went to for years  it's kind of funny because he'd always go when i was at appleby   laugh in the appleby days  well actually he was sent there  i don't know if i told you this uhm   both his parents died young but his mother died when he was just a teen  mhh hmm  and they knew his mother was dying and his mother uhm i think according to my mom arranged to send him away for the two years at school so she wouldn't see so he wouldn't see  her deteriorate number one  hmm  number two he'd get used to not having her around  maybe that was a good thing  so   ya so  and his dad died when he was fairly young too  i know i think bef i'm sure before   he married my mom  he had a heart attack  that's tough   they both they both   had heart problems  like i know uhm  who took care of him  my dad
