 i mean you can do the same technique of sound blankets if this is on a tripod as you can with that  only this has got a head start   right  but okay take a five minute break  i'm going to go call this guy and then i shall return  tape cuts out audience members laughing and talking   okay so now that's how you load  when we're done you guys can play with mags try loading it but there's more you got  so the next thing to do is to adjust your eye piece to your eye  the viewfinder  there's two people who need to have the viewfinder adjusted the camera operator and the camera assistant  question   comment   director doesn't have to see the focus  there's usually video assist and they'll see it through that  the reason why the camera assistant and the camera operator the camera operator will see the frame get the shot but once the shot's going  the shutter moving in front of his eye causes everything to be slightly soft anyhow   'kay okay   and so they can't tell if you're in focus or not if you're the camera assistant  they can tell if you're dramatically out of focus   all right  but they can't tell if you're slightly softer focus or if you're sharp  so that's why you need to be word in your focus cos it's your job as the camera assistant to get the focus  so what i did on this camera is i showed a way to set the eye pieces  and i'll show you in detail how you get your eye piece  but what you do is you find a mark as a guide mark  and then you find focus and you put another piece of tape and that's yours  and then you put the camera operator or the camera assistant in another colour  and don't knock this because if you knock it then you have to fight to open it and move it  and the camera operator never wants to have it out of focus his  eye piece  hopefully he has the same eyes  there's a lot of latitude in that for the focus  but if you're the camera assistant and you've just taken some marks and now you've gone back you you're done and it's for the camera operator you must put it back to the camera operator's eye  cos if the camera operator starts looking goes everything's out of focus check your focus check the focus and you go my focus is fine  and you go my focus is fine  and then you go whoops sorry they're gonna   going to be like hey come on we just lost some time panicking about the image let's work here  the next thing you have to do once you get the focus done is you as a camera assistant must show up on set with these  these are cushions for the eye piece  'kay okay if you don't show up on set with these it's like a big sign of disrespect to your camera operator  the production should pay for them   they cost five dollars apiece  i have some left over from another production that you know i've kept with me in case the next production i go on doesn't have them  the reason why you have them is that eye piece is plastic  for one you sweat in a hot room   if you're in that eye piece for sixteen hours a day for four weeks you're gonna going to have a ring of acne and infection   laugh   this you change every day   the next thing is if it's cold out and you sweat your eye then freezes to the plastic audience laughter starts   and so what happens now is they've actually got  audience laughter stops you put this on and then they've got an electric heater inside the eye piece now that when it's cold you plug into the camera  and it starts to heat the eye piece   but the plastic will still burn the skin all right from the cold cos it'll freeze so you have to have this on as well  question   this you can buy at panavision moliflex michel trudel  wherever you get camera equipment  question   ya you take off the lens and you aim to the brightest light source  if you don't have one the camera assistant and the camera operator trade back and forth shine a flashlight into the gate  warn the person looking through that it's going to happen cos it could cause retina burn and then adjust the eye piece accordingly  the way you test is go completely out of focus for your eye and move into focus on the grid inside the eye piece  once that's sharp pass it then you turn backwards and you'll get focused for your eye piece  mark it then let the other person do the same  short, off-topic exchange with a new speaker   that's the same for every camera   okay it's the same mechanism on this this the new ones out   it's the same thing  so then you move to the lenses cough   for this camera to load the lenses is very simple  up here is a little tooth  i don't know if you can see it   a little tooth inside audience murmurs on the top  audience murmurs   okay   'kay okay what you do with that  is there's a hole so male female and you enter audience murmurs  and that's it  the lens is installed   'kay okay   now the thing with this is that you could put three lenses on   i suggest that if don't need your lenses on make sure the caps are on even though it is sealed inside  it's just better protection   so   question   okay there's  th there's three ways i've seen the gate being checked  two of them are correct  one is from first-year and second-year students who don't know how which is to take the door off and look in which is you lose film  to check the gate it's the same way to move the registration pin  okay  it moves the shutter and the pin at the same time   okay  now there's two ways to check the gate   one is to press down on these two buttons here that are all the way around  each one is it it   loosens the lock  slide it out   move the uh shutter so that you can see the film and there's your film inside maybe three words   okay  and you can check the gate with a magnifying glass and flashlight  there's another way to check the gate and i use this one because it's easier to see   question   hair dirt dust  but what happens is when you take the lens off frequently you actually allowing dust in  so the fastest and best way to check the gate without a magnifying glass is to use the magnifying glass which the lens is   so you open the lens up all the way   focus at infinity f-stop here t eight and then   i don't know  i doubt you can see it but if you look at the right angle with the flashlight you will actually see a magnified version of the plane of the film  and then if you work around each corner you can see if there's any dirt in the film  you don't have to take anything off the camera   you save time and you don't allow dust in  question   statement   it's more accurate   be because well you  because you need a magnifying glass to see a sixteen mil  millimetre frame  there's stuff that can be there that you might not see   like this  if i   question   no you look in the lens   and it's word a magnifying glass and i can see the entire mechanism perfectly  and i can see now the felt already ripping through   i mean pulled down  and i would have to clean that out before i continued to shoot  question   if you look in look at the very top  can you see the top of the film  agrees   'kay okay   do you see how there's little pieces of fabric at the top  agrees   there are  trust me audience laughter   well you have to hold the flashlight yourself  don't look at the glass  look past the pane of glass in and you'll see the film   the big orange   agrees agrees   do you see it as a little word at the top  $zd> agrees   there you go audience laughter   a few words   you have to clean these out  question   ya with the word stick  question   ya   question   you clean it   question   ya then you have to take the lens off   question   no no no  understands   take the lens off  you clean it with this  question   word and with this   question   no  first you do   is if   okay if this is the gate word example  'kay okay the dirt that's there is actually the felt that's inside the camera where the film comes through like that   and it's cos it's an old camera it's bringing in fabric after running it for a while  what you have to do is you take this and you just clean off  all the way around the gate  blow to make sure the dust gets out  run it again  if it reappears then you take it out and you clean it out  take apart your camera again and clean it off     question   no  here and here   okay   so that's how to check the gate in the fastest way  you can you can take a look when  you're done  questions   pardon  rephrase question more question    ya all cameras that would   that's the best way to check the gate  the only problem is some zoom lenses the opening to the gate is so small and there's so many layers of glass to magnify down  that you can't see anything no matter how hard you try  but with the prime lenses it's very simple to see  it's easy it's fast and it's clean   okay  mumbled phrase   okay so that's how you load the  a few words lenses  that's how you load the lenses on this camera  if you wanna want to try go ahead  no what makes this audience murmuring a couple words complicated is the they way that a few words   question   just so you know that's a mag-lite  pronounced mack-lite   question   it's a mag-lite   if anybody asks you on a set for the mag-lite  that's what they're referring to audience discussion of flashlights   'kay okay to look to take the lens off on this the first thing you have to do is loosen   'kay okay   here this outside ring you have to loosen it and it says in which direction  it says loose and fixed    all right   okay  there's no pressure in these   once it's turned it's turned and it's locked  so you loosen it  the next step is to take the lens out   you can't do it on the table so i'm gonna going to do it here but i'm going to show you what i'm going to be doing  i'm gonna going to be pressing this silver button here  okay  this silver button here unlocks the teeth that hold onto the bayonet mount inside  it's a different type of lens   okay  so all you do is press this and it's out  okay  it's a bayonet   'kay okay   you gotta have got to get used to a lot of military terms  for some reason that 's come into film but magazines bayonets   okay and to put it in it's the same thing  you lock and you close this ring   and you're done and the lens is in  it's tight  there's no problem  okay  that's how you load the lens in  now if you're using prime lenses on this all you have to do is take the prime lens out  put it into a new blimp which looks like   but never leave the case by the way   no   question   that's not the lens  that's a blimp to prevent sound  never leave the case on set or anywhere unlocked or you will be kicked off set  all right  there's just something   all you need to do is lock one of them but don't leave them unlocked unless it's open   here  this is the blimp   it's to prevent sound  this one doesn't work because there isn't a ground glass which is a clean piece of glass to send the sound back into the camera  but you can always take the ground glass from this one and put it in here  'kay okay   take the ground glass off and turn this knob  again it says where and how to open it
