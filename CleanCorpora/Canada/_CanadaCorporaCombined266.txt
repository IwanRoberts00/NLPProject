dowell with the c b c news for quebec  premier parizeau says he'll release a document today that proves ottawa is trying to get the other provinces to urge quebecers to vote no in the referendum  the premier says he still plans to attend next month's  premiers' conference in st john's newfoundland unless other provinces join in a common front against quebec  we get more in this report from tricia langbein   parizeau has a few story ideas for journalists that don't involve lobsters reference to parizeau's alleged comments that a yes vote will be like throwing lobsters into boiling water   he wants to know if a common front is being organized by other premiers against quebec  he points the finger at federal cabinet minister lucienne robillard  is it true that mrs robillard has asked mr filmon ah some weeks ago to build a sort of common front of nine provinces  that would say to quebecers a we love you b vote no and we'll change things but we won't tell you until afterwards   parizeau alleges the premier of manitoba gary filmon approached several premiers on this topic  they included newfoundland premier clyde wells who said he would have no part of this common front  tricia langbein   c b c news quebec city  lucienne robillard says parizeau's allegation is  hogwash really unbelievable   she says she spoke to filmon about national unity issues but she didn't mention any common front against quebec  she says it's normal for ottawa to have contact with all the provinces   representatives from kahnawake and akwesasne will be in kanesatake today  kahnawake's grand chief tim horten says the mohawk leaders will be discussing the marijuana growing at kanesatake and the lack of policing there  he's urging the federal and provincial governments to reconsider a plan to send trained mohawk peacekeepers into the community  he says the peacekeepers could provide immediate much-needed stability  i think the majority of the people in that community  have very legitimate concerns about ahh the issue of law and order in the community  and i'm not saying it's a lawless community or anything like that  but it is sort of in a in a vacuum  horten says there will always be people willing to exploit a vacuum like the people growing the marijuana  the s q has been reluctant to intervene in kanesatake since the nineteen ninety oka crisis  the band council has set up a community watch team but some people say it's little more than an early warning system in case of a police raid   the province's consumer protection office has tested eighty brands of hot dogs and there were problems with almost half of them  it found more than a million bacteria per gram in levitz  all beef hot dogs schneider's lifestyle hot dogs and thai fair all beef hot dogs  an article in the august issue of protect yourself magazine shows some samples yielded one hundred million bacteria per gram  there was nothing wrong with budget korsch all beef and high grade all beef dogs   health officials in sherbrooke are reassuring people they don't have to worry about getting lyme disease  a report last week said at least three people in the area had been bitten by ticks  fran macintosh has the story  french speech in background   doctor laura renault worked the weekend shift in the emergency room at sherbrooke's h&ocircumflex;tel-dieu  hospital  she says people kept pouring in worried they'd been bitten by ticks carrying lyme disease  they'd read a headline in saturday's newspapers saying the lyme tick had hit the region  at least three people had been bitten and had to be treated within twenty-four hours  dr renault says she ended up examining a lot of mosquito bites  and today the lyme tick threat is hard to trace  the doctor who said he treated the cases is on holidays and no one can reach him  cases like these are usually reported to the regional health board  yet sara martel a public health doctor with the board says there are no details and no proof  it's really uh a non proved cases from the beginning  these kinds of insects are usually analysed at sherbrooke's university hospital  but doctor shaw a microbiologist who works at the hospital says the insects weren't sent to their laboratory  doctor shaw says only one of these ticks has ever been found in the eastern townships  but the fact that it is of the correct species doesn't necessarily mean that it that it was infected with the the bacteria the spirochete that transmits lyme disease  that tick was found last may and he doesn't think it was indigenous  fran macintosh c b c news sherbrooke  montreal's programme aimed at getting people to buy new houses is not getting the response city officials were hoping for  a hundred and forty-five people have filed applications so far  a similar programme last year was much more modest yet it had attracted a thousand applications by the same time last year  people taking advantage of it this year don't have to pay up to ten thousand dollars in taxes over the first two years  an analyst with the city's housing corporation jamie p&eacute;pin says people appear to be worried they could lose their jobs  he says the fluctuations in interest rates aren't helping either  canadian and american pulp and paper companies are looking for reliable supplies of wood  domtar is looking for an alternative  the quebec based company is the first in north america to try making pulp from grass  kelly ulrich reports  it's called agripaper  it's paper made from fibers grown in a field not in a forest  barry thompson hopes it will play an important role in the pulp and paper industry of the future  he's the executive director of reap canada an organization that promotes sustainable agriculture  and he's growing the grass and straw that domtar is turning into pulp and paper  the grasses that we're growing are the fastest growing plants in the world  these grasses are growing about twice as fast as conventional ah crops   and uh they have unique characteristics that make them grow that fast and they're very water efficient  and that's why in this drought year that we've got exceptionally good yields even though it's been one of the driest years in forty years here in quebec  thompson says switch grass in particular can be processed into pulp with fewer chemicals and using less energy than wood  and unlike trees which take decades to grow these grasses can be harvested every year  thompson says alternative fibers can reduce the pressure to cut natural forests  and as a new cash crop these grasses could give farm communities a much-needed boost  while the process is still at the experimental stage domtar hopes to have paper made from grass or straw on the market within a few years  kelly ulrich c b c news montreal  that was the c b c news for quebec   music and dj radio patter   we'll talk to the people from environment canada in just a few minutes  uh but first to find out to see if there's any impact uh on the roads because of this uh wet weather cam jeffrey is here  cam uh any impact yet  impact not a good word  to l to use laugh when we're talking about traffic there kyle   laugh   laugh   no no impact   no collisions  good   no  no impact so far but uh we'll keep an eye out for that  of course do be careful out there this morning uh it is raining a little bit and uh it is slick in spots uh so watch your speed and keep your distance  uh generally the the routes into town from the west island south southshore and laval look good  starting to build a bit at the champlain bridges it usually does  at this time of day but uh nothing serious there  the orange line on the metro line two was closed briefly uh between uh six and six thirty actually just before six thirty but it was reopened quite quickly  and it was closed down between berri and beaubien kyle  because uh apparently somebody blew up a night deposit box in the sherbrooke metro station so the uh police were a little bit concerned there might be other explosives around so they they closed uh the line which is uh becoming a kind of a common practice these days isn't it  hmm not   yeah uh hopefully it won't become too common  uh the less common it is uh the better it is for all of us  word   but it seems that hardly a day goes by when we don't have uhm a suspicious package or something like that going on  a suspicious package somewhere yeah   each week   so that's today's uh  anyway let's hope that's the last one for today and otherwise things look good  okay thanks cam   cam jeffrey will be back uh

be talking about the set point and weight control on the fitness file in just a couple of minutes  but first for the latest on the world of sports here's  xavier roth   good morning   tennis off the top and the men's canadian open in montreal  greg rusedski the canadian who recently became a british citizen was back playing for the first time in canada since moving overseas  not exactly the kind of homecoming he would've liked for a couple of reasons  rusedski lost his opening singles match to american michael joyce in straight sets  but he must've had a hard time concentrating on his game because as marie macdonald reports his reception in montreal was rather frosty tennis commentary in french, people booing   greg rusedski's homecoming was far from friendly yesterday  the former montrealer not only had to face tough competition on the court but an even tougher crowd in the stands at jarry tennis stadium  he was booed as he entered the court booed as he left the court and booed at all times inbetween  the few fans he had were drowned out by the loud boo birds  rusedski says the hostile crowd didn't affect his game though   he just went out and played the best tennis he could with or without support  in fact the booing seemed not to bother him at all  didn't hurt my feelings or didn't hurt hurt  me at all  i mean i i thought that i was  gonna going to get a a  difficult reaction  i kind of expected it so i was prepared for it  i mean it was exciting i mean come on i mean how  how many times have you been to a tennis match and seen so much excitement from controversy going on  good practice for davis cup i guess  although greg rusedski won't be going for the singles title at the canadian open he is still alive in doubles action  it was there that he was able to silence one of his harshest critics  former team mate sebastien lareau is openly critical of rusdeski's decision to play for britain but on the court lareau and his partner leblanc were just two more players for rusedski and wekesa to defeat  they just had to do it without any support from the fans  marie macdonald   c b c sports montreal booing   heh  okay on to hockey news
