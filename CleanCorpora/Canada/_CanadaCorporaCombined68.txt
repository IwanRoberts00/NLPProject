 what's in your mind at the time of death why  why does maybe two words   well because uhh when you die it  because they have this belief in reincarnation  the cycular   circular nature of things then that what you are at that moment is transmitted into some other  uh uh that is just being conceived  and uh is   is bir   a few words   ya   creature  being   uh huh   so is that when it happens  at the moment of conception   at conception   and that's another thing that makes abortion very   inter interesting   so the moment of conception and the moment of death there has to be a couple of mumbled words   ya and then and then   there you know there's a lot of predetermination in it in the sense that you uhh uhm   there's a law the law of karma that works  and and law of karma means you inherit what you deserve from your previous incarnation and it lives on and the next until you've worked yourself either up the   the ladder to nirvana or down into forms of lower existence   mhh hmm   and it's uhh uh uh it's really very very it's very interesting   but intention is uh   but there's a case in the one of the uhh the uhh  nagoya supreme court in nineteen sixty something i think that has to do with euthanasia  and it lays down the conditions under which accepted euthanasia  uhm and it is almost the same as what  there were about six qualifications  that it's the will of the person who's dying either expressed then or at some previous time  that it is done by doctors uh and so on  but but there's one   and the docus doctors  are pardoned for doing this   uhh i don't think they need pardoned  they don't need pardoned anyways  no   okay   but uh they the   the condition is that the the   person must be at peace of mind at the time and i don't think that's  mhh hmm   the conditions are pretty well the same as in western cultures but not that peace of mind   that peace of mind is important  isn't it  ya   ya   tremendously important   uh huh  and another thing uh uh well about abortion in japan   th they the the uhm there's no question in their mind but that life begins at conception  mhh hmm  so they don't debate that issue   you know  it's just simply not a   it begins at conception  so so the fetus   mhh hmm   i'm gonna going to make you sugar and cream  okay   although this is a very nice sugar  well i w i want you to make me sugar and cream   i know   you know i'm just getting good   and i want   well you're they're great  they're all really great those  you haven't even seen any of my stuff  i have so  i've seen lots of your stuff  but you haven't seen all of them  your pots   no not all of it  but there's lots of it  that shouldn't take too long before it's drinkable   i would think  that's okay   i would hope  uhm so where can you  ya so she phones   ya  laugh she's so incredibly not on this planet  why   to tell me that she was waiting for violet  halloween night   i'm sorry that i didn't see her  was this was anything prearranged  no  no she just sits at home every halloween night with her  costume on and waits for the kids to come by  and waits   and all the other kids do  but she didn't say anything to you guys like hey don't forget to bring vi by or it'd be really nice to see her  no  no she doesn't have time to do that but she has time three days later to say   to be martyr-mom   word serious martyr-mom  i was so upset that i didn't see violet   and then she has no concept of who  you know you sort of tell violet a story and she says oh ya   laugh   laugh   but she has a a word    but she doesn't know her from adam   no   no  you know her  you know you you sort of  anticipate what the responses are and all that stuff  mhh hmm   she hasn't learned   well the terrible thing i think for violet is that i see her growing rapidly bored with her cousins and her aunts and uncles  the older she gets she's gonna going to  get really bored with them  well that that that's not a big deal  mhh uh  so she does  mhh   i had minimal contact with my cousins until adulthood  and then i searched them out and that's   gr great you know  that's a good thing   mhh hmm   ya   okay so what else did she say   oh jamie felt this  you know jamie was so upset about the referendum  like jamie wa was   is the only anglophone in quebec that we know  laugh   or jamie didn't sleep the night before   i said did you go to any rallies  you know no   laugh   no but i had a canada flag in my car laugh   oh ya  oh she didn't say anything  the worst effect of her that her phone calls have is that i sit there and say oh barry she's such a jerk  ya laugh   and of course i call and go oh god i called you again i was calling my dad  and barry goes oh well i'm on the other line with my mom  and i went what for   laugh   well it just has to be a fact of making   like for some reason i thought maybe he called her or something  ya   i mean like why  and this is just gonna going to   let   cos it never occurred to me that that  that she would have actually called him  no she called  and i thought he was in with violet putting her to bed so i didn't dare interrupt him  ohh   in fact he was reading the newspaper  i could have killed him  oh my god  cos he came sort of sauntering up and i'd been through hell on wheels with her  did he put her to bed  i would never uh  what did she say   i would never live with my kids  hooo  where on earth did she get that from  well she does live with her kid for one  and i was she was talking about how she wanted to have an apartment and i said well  oh i'm sorry you oh you're  talking about his mom   this is no this is  barry 's mom   oh i thought this was violet   oh no   no  barry 's mother would never imposed her will on her children  ahh laugh   and i you know i sit there and say  oh no of course you wouldn't  like what kind of a shot are you taking at my mom  wha you know what are you doing   mhh hmm   anyway  that's weird  ya   well no that's typical  she's such a jerk   she's she's a complete and utter manipulating   passive aggressive cow   she's such a huge manipulator   mhh hmm  she's a waste of life   god it's it's just  astounding that barry 's as brilliant as he is faint background noises; shouting?   street noises   i have googly in my tea   so how are you feeling   you're very busy  i'm very busy  i'm feeling kind of weird  uhm i'm feeling sort of detached  i'm feeling   from   just life in general  from   no no actually  not from life in general but from uhm the issue   although every once in a while i just think of the two of them together and i just s just like  something inside of me wants to erupt  and then what happens  and then i go no don't buy into that  don't go off on that tangent  just  you can do a mental image thing  you can do like a a a crunch your hands and stop screaming thing  oh okay  well i never thought laugh about that   i read about that   oh did you  ya  there's a book i should give you  feeling good the new mew new  mood therapy  oh jesus laugh christ   laugh no no no but it will   the whole premise of it is behaviourism and and  it will  you can't control your thoughts but you can can control the beliefs that lead to your thoughts or your actions when you have those thoughts   two words   okay  so if you say tia and gary and then you say stop you can  ya  but i was just i just i mean i just   find it annoying  no not annoying  i find it really intensely hurtful still so  if you can stop looking at it as something that was done to you it might help   that's ya  and actually for the first time in my whole life i'm actually being able to intellectualize it that way  ryan was always ew i took everything ryan did way too personally  like it was me an an  aggression towards me   and half of it was  but i mean the uhm the  non-overt stuff  the overt stuff was not directed at me i guess  and   well see it makes sense for you to interpret it that way in a lot of ways because all of your actions were being guided the effect it would have on gary   ya ya  so   so it would make sense that you would think that his actions would be  mhh hmm     well it was interesting i had  why did anne quit work  i don't know  uhm   she didn't seem to give barry any  she wasn't fired though  no no  oh   but i wonder why  i don't know  i have no idea   i can't see that she would have felt weird about uh   i mean i hope i mean tia has to understand that like barry 's not pleased with her and you're not pleased with her and a whole bunch of people are   oh i don't think she cares   why would she care  cos i think she sorta sort of   felt that we all had sort of that there was i don't know i think because she thought there was some basis in a friendship  with us all or something  but it was really interesting cos gerry folsom when i worked with him on the other day he said oh i saw tia and gary  at the black tomato and i went oh ya  laugh   so i brought him up to speed and he was so cute  he said doesn't that just make you sm  wanna want to like just don't you just get   so angry about that  isn't that the nastiest thing you could ever find out  and i said ya   laugh   he said ya word   it's really interesting how people will tell you   he was really he was really  uhm   he said that's just low  that's low  ya   you know and   oh and jasmine sat there saying yes yes keep on   and i sat there saying ya ya it was mean   laugh   makes you wanna want to spit   laugh   ya  so but he said that when he walked in he looked around cos he was looking for a friend and then he turned around and saw  tia and gary and tia was trying to sort of hide  she was just like trying not to make eye contact with him but of course he said i just went over and said hi and everything  and i s i thought well you know that's really interesting  obviously if she had that reaction to seeing someone who she knew would be seeing me who she knew knew her  knew the whole story and that she had that reaction you would think that they might have discussed the  im you know the reaction i would have  and have said something like well maybe  you gary should tell her   and   and this should be dealt with  ya   ya   ya   what's plan a   ya   ya  uhm and the other thing is when i found out gary was seeing someone new uhm i said to him then since you and i are maintaining a friendship although it's going to be a friendship that's   gonna going to take some time and we're not you know gonna going to be able to achieve that for maybe you know a while  oh you guys had analysis-of-friendship discussions  we had one   you you had like a plan as to how you were
