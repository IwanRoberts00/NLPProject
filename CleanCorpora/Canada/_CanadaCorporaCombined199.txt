had to come up with another stops on that exchange  another couple of saves on that exchange  uh lethbridge has the home team is the home team for tonight's game  they kinda kind of rotate it and uh   i'm not sure if the coaches and staff is tryna  trying to do line combinations against other lines but uh   tonight they got uh coach daum has had zarowny's line against  gatto's line and and disowic   and that was the lethbridge defense line last night so it's worked out good for the bears in that way  aaron zarowny will face-off against greg gatto once more  to the stickhand side of cavilla  bears tried for a late change but they couldn't get it in   they wanted to change up the defense   i think they wanted to have sherban and  and hjertaas against oh no sorry pullishy and goodkey against the unclear words line  oh you're lookin' looking at the bench aren'tcha aren't you to see who's next  out   right   who's up  who's up   bears have it off the draw  simpson shot  that's blocked  simpson gets another chance  rifles it wide of the net   cavilla pokes it off the backboards away from the cage  and there's disowic tryna trying to  clear   horns clear it  adair   now ahead to strand  he's hit hard  aaron and colin zarowny moving in  he rips a shot high and wide of the net   now hal christiansen takes a look  shoots it towards the net  a penalty coming up as greg gatto went down behind the play  and we'll see a pronghorn power play here   greg gatto's been in everybody's face tonight  he's a solid he's the captain of lethbridge  a solid player   and uh he's rocked a lot of guys tonight  kent simpson tried to give the defensemen a little bit of time there  it took him out of the play but it was a bit of interference and  i'm not sure if they call it tripping or hooking or interference but uh   tough call but the bears have ki looked so pretty good so far killin' killing   one of their best penalty killers in the box right now though   kent simpson heads off for the two-eleven mark   and so the pronghorns who are oh for two on the power play get their third chance here   frank esposito has a coupla couple of  goals  terry degner has the other as the bears lead it three nothing  i think it's tripping against simpson   here's harper from his own blue line as the pronghorns work on this power play   here they go  kelln for harper ahead on the left side to gatto  he's in across the line on the left wing  lets a shot go  nowhere near the net  bounces off the glass to the right point  kelln holds it in   goes in behind the goal  goodkey'll fish it out   goodkey steps out front of his own net   now he gets a chance to move it off the boards and down the ice   great play   great play by mark goodkey   kinda kind of  faked us out  i thought he was going right in front of the net but he pulled it back and made a nice stop   made a nice clearing play pardon me  jarret zukiwsky now with it   he's to the line and across  he can motor   spins it back to the point  nobody there though as the pronghorns have changed up their defense   one of them anyway   now here's gatto on the left wing in across the line  gatto driving  passing out front of the net  comes over to zukiwsky   zukiwsky back hand pass to gatto  to the right point to harper   back to gatto  lots of time  moves in from the circle  his shot is skipped wide of the net  comes off the boards   fired in around the boards by riehl  comes up the other side  gatto gets it back to the point to harper  one of the bears has lost his stick  here's a plus   saved masson   comes back to the point again   round behind the net  zukiwsky lays it there for o'rourke  has a man breaking his shot  went off his skate  bounces at the side of the net  and there's masson to jump on top of it   zarron doesn't say 'aaron' zarowny had lost his stick   and that put the bears effectively two men short   smart play though by aaron zarowny  for a while there th he didn't have a stick and uh  lethbridge a easy time up up top with the puck but uh he came out of his own zone when the pronghorns got the puck in their end to get a stick from the bench and why not cos you need a stick out there if you're gonna going to be uh  any deep to kill in the penalty  guba golden bears' mascot walking by our  gondola facility here   and offering his greetings for the evening   great with the kids isn't he  tony hackett   chuckle   face-off stick-hand side of masson   horns have it off the draw  gatto to the point for riehl  back to gatto  back to riehl  lets the shot go  it's blocked   and a great play by esposito  he blocked it and then swept it down the ice himself  great play by esposito  everybody on the bears i everybody's into this game tonight  here's wobick with it ahead to riehl on the left side  he fires it in across the bear line  masson knocks it down behind the net  trevor sherban'll play it off the boards to the line and out  riehl sends it back in  that'll allow the bears another chance  there's one second  that's it  simpson's out of the penalty box   the bears killed off  here's simpson with the puck at centre ice steps in on the wing  fires it toward the net  cavilla stops it  back to play it is wobick  plays it up the wall   carpenter's hit but he got it ahead to gatto  however trevor sherban sends it right back in   it's a late offside against the bears   as i thought they tagged up but the linesmen disagreed  and we get a break  fifteen twenty-seven to go in the second   three nothing   university of alberta golden bears lead the university of lethbridge pronghorns in canada west university playoff hockey action  game two of this best of three here at the clare drake arena  and a little frustration starting to show on the pronghorns' bench uh   a power play  couple a of the big boys  zukiwsky and gatto weren't happy with some of the work by uh uh jeremy zeihl speaker error: should be " riehl"   made a couple very uh ill-timed passes and uh   and a little bit a of chirpin'  chirping going on on the bench   horns hammered it into the bears' zone  back to play it is thompson  thompson a chance to clear  he flips it into the near the bench  of the bears  comes off the glass  here's tiltgen driving towards the net  he's tied up   the puck got away from him and disowic has it at centre   plays it over the right side for carpenter  he sends it in across the line   masson knocks it down  comes over to  here's a shot  dave masson has disowic turned  he got a loose puck and ripped it from a sharp angle   as i think that was uh an attempt by degner from the corner to corral that puck but it took a crazy hop off his stick  right into the lane for disowic and his shot was stopped by masson  you don't wanna want to give lethbridge an easy goal   and you don't i suppose wanna want to  give 'em them a power play goal either and get their power play runnin' running   i think uh i'm with you kevin i think   one of the main focus for the bears is th  is not to take penalties  lethbridge they don't really look tired   uh the power play in my opinion is the only thing that's  gonna going to get 'em them  back in this hockey game  three nothing alberta in front of lethbridge   esposito will face-off against graham outside the bear line   comes over on the left side  leroux sends it in across the line  behind the net  masson leaves it for pullishy  gets it ahead to strand and he'll bounce it off the boards  can he get it out  yes he does  esposito has it  now ahead to haney   he's in across the line  haney with a wrist shot  he ripped one high over top of the net  back to the right point simpson   he'll wind up  lets a blast go  blocker save by cavilla   and it ends up in the crowd   good shot there  first haney went a high and hard with a wrist shot and then simpson the same spot with a a a good slapper and uh  uh keep throwin' throwing a puck at cavilla  he's played pretty well  both nights uh no soft goals  all the goals have been pretty good for the bears so far  haney shoots left  came down on the left wing and ripped  he really leaned into it and sizzled one past cavilla but it was just a little high and over top of the net   dean tiltgen will face-off now for the bears against tyler graham   draw will be to the glove-hand side of cavilla   tiltgen's waved outta out of there so in comes degner  degner has the golden bears' third goal here tonight   bears fight for control   degner has it in the right corner  degner centres out front  here's a shot   and a stop by cavilla off of thompson   puck deep in the lethbridge zone   deep in the corner   simpson skates  there's degner  tripped up on the play  got it over to thompson  thompson walks in  thompson can't get free  left point  held in by pullishy   there's tiltgen turning in the left corner now  tiltgen  cycles it down low but kelln intercepts   and the pronghorns will clear  comes in on goal   masson knocks it down for goodkey  plays it up the boards for degner  he lost it   horns with a chance   they pick it up on the turnover   now tiltgen able to clear it out to centre  scary play there for a moment but the bears were able to cover up   goodkey from behind his own net   gets it ahead on the wing  degner out to centre ice for aaron zarowny  that's broken up   goodkey from his own end   zukiwsky now   he lost it  here comes aaron zarowny  he's hammered on a play by regan harper   this might go as interference although the pass was coming over there  it was blocked but the pass was on its way and harper stepped into aaron zarowny before the puck got there and we're gonna  going to see a bear power play   and i think evan it was a bit of a uh make-up call cos thirty seconds before that i didn't see the entire play and i'm not sure if uh uh referee mccory saw it either but mike thompson just got whacked   and he's a tough guy and he was rollin' rolling  all over the ice and you don't see that much and uh   i'm not sure i i it looked like the end of a slash maybe but uh he got whacked hard and maybe george mccory saw part of that and then decided to even it up cos uh  unclear word the pass was coming to zarowny and it was a good play by harper actually  bears are in front three nothing jake but they've only had one power play  this'll be their second   and we see darryn krywko and uh mike jickling swap  once again on uh left point   harper for interference at six thirty-three and the bears go to work on the power play  as trevor d sherban starts up from centre
