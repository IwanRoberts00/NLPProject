 ah this continued  we continued with being part of the n f b national film board  until about nineteen eighty-five and then in eighty-five along with  a number of different cutbacks uhh the entire collection at that point was put into archives and the entire institution was shut down  i mean people continued to work people continued to acquire uhm pieces for the collection but we didn't have a home  there wasn't anywhere to be  so they started work building this place  and first of all it took uhm about five years to find the location  this location had been an old railway tunnel which is why  architecturally it's this design very long narrow and deep  uh it runs from what used to be the uhm train station which is down  word centre out to the big  have you been to the national gallery word  today  okay  you know that big bridge over there uhm the princess alice or alexander  i can't remember what it's called  anyway you know that bridge it all hooked up  it's all tied into one  so our collection as it stands now  this building was opened in uh ninety-two  so it's relatively new  the collection has about a hundred and sixty pieces  it's black and white colour slides uhm print images in some installation pieces  cos there are a number of artists who are working in photography as insallation pieces  uh we have an acquisitions budget annually about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars  uh it's a small staff who works here  it's nothing like the national gallery which is this huge staff which is  it's a big institution and it's very hard to get your work into that institution  uhm we have people coming in artists da  almost daily with portfolios having assessments done by curators  so we're very accessible  uh and often it's a lot more fun to see you know  you know young artists coming in and and  the stuff that they've got  now as a result these two exhibitions that we have rights and realities and the one in the next uhm gallery called dialogue which after we're done with rights and realities you're more than welcome to go through and take a look at uhh fall into a real journalism documentary style  we don't have really anything that would be except for this piece here that's done by the uh group word  culture uhm it's the only piece that would be considered  modern or experimental  uh some of our earlier uhm exhibitions in the summer and last spring were more contentious a little more bizarre a little more  interesting in that more art vein  uh we're going a little bit to try we have to try and balance and do a little bit of each style  uhm also because we're trying to target different uhm people   who to come in and see the uh exhibitions  now uhm any questions about the museum  anything that you're really interested in about it  okay   who can tell me what journalistic photography is two minute question and answer discussion with extra-corpus audience members   okay that's you're getting the right idea  essentially uhm journalism is a photographic witness to something that's immediate and it's a very short uhm exercise  uh there's there's very little preamble and there's very little follow-up  it's just the one image  with documentary uh you usually have it working more like a study  so you'll have people working for maybe a number of weeks months even years on one subject so that it really ends up becoming a text itself  it has this notion of a beginning a middle and an end  and it can be accompanied by text but not necessarily  it often goes into a book form or a magazine form  and it's more of a large format deal  uhm but the approach is almost the same  you you are recording and recording is the thing that's most important  it's keeping a record and keeping track of some event or uhm a culture or a group of people or a community   now what we're going to look at with rights and realities is  a bridge between the two  in a way it's documentary but it's more like photojournalism  uh the project was put together by a man named david barber who worked for cida  does anyone know what cida is   canadian international development association  it's located here in ottawa  it's a federally-funded institution who goes around worldwide  usual usually well predominantly third world project building  they go into uhm villages in let's say zaire and put in uh project leaders to help build water irrigation systems and uhm put in for education uhm healthcare uhm agriculture uhm political development designing infrastructures for countries that have gone through war and don't have   an infr like a a political or a social or urban infrastructure   they design all these for them or with them  not for them but with them  uhm so cida is always going around with photographers taking photographs of their projects using it for their publications  so there's already an interest in photography there  then in order to get more funding cos these things always cost a lot of money they went to an institute that's in montreal called the international institute for human rights and democratic development  has anyone ever heard of that seems to be an unrecorded audience response   no  it's a pretty new group  but has everyone heard of amnesty international seems to be an unrecorded audience response   okay  it's very similar to amn amnesty   international  it's a watchdog group  they look at different countries  they they pinpoint areas where human rights are in conflict and uh where they're being violated  so then they came to us here at the museum because the person or the project leader wanted to have this group of photographs curated by uhm an institute well shown by an institution but curated by someone who was professionally involved with photographs from a purely uhm aesthetic technical point of view  someone who wasn't involved with the issues but just with photographs because all too often when we use project people to choose images you get clich&eacute;d images  does anyone know what i mean by a clich&eacute;d image   what is it  answer   right  and why what's the purpose of a clich&eacute;d image  answer   mhh hmm   kay okay that's on a positive side  we could also look at this as being a very manipulative way of  changing people's getting people to think a certain way    it can be very manipulative  and the one thing that we have to remember about photographs  are that they are manipulative and that while we have to  certainly abandon a certain amount towards believing what we see as being real always remember that someone took the photograph someone made a selection someone chose to uh put something in the frame and someone chose to leave something out of the frame  so you should always come to any image with a really healthy questioning about okay why am i being shown this picture how does it work with the text what's missing   like what am i not seeing  cos it's so easy for us especially photographs in black and white uhm to just believe everything  anybody tell me why we tend to see journalistic photographs in black and white   there's a couple of reasons   answer   cheap ya cheaper and easier is very true   what else   how do you react if you see uhm images in colour or images in black and white particularly these images something shocking   answer   right  answer   which the colour or the black and white  the black and white   uhm i think maybe what it is that with colour uh you tend to be more dazzled by the colour than by the actual image so that if you see uh an image of someone lying dead in a pool of blood in colour it's very graphic and we desensitize ourself to what exactly is going on but you see that same image in black and white and you have to really look  and you have to think about the image and actually think that this is a person lying dead in a pool of blood and how graphic it is   how graphic that's made in our mind as opposed to how it's made graphic on the page  right now if word magazines like uh maclean's canadian publications like maclean's use a lot of colour for all their news stories but then their news stories if you look if you go in and you look through maclean's you'll find that their news stories  tends tend to be pretty one dimensional and fairly flat  colour for them is just fashionable  colour is very fashionable right now in terms of news  it'll pass  but black and white will always stay predominantly the uhm medium of choice for most photographers uh just because it is more gritty  and you know how everyone says uhm it it's   in black and white  it's black and white is the language of contract  it's written in black and white   that gives it this idea of real and legal and uh believable uh trustworthy so that that'll last  now this particular exhibition has six photopraphers  as you're aware  all women   all but uh one of them cindy andrew is in fact is a photojournalist  she lives in new delhi  her husband's a uh print journalist  they both cover mm uh southeast asia  uhm she does most of her contract work for the globe the globe and mail: canadian newspaper but she also has is  within an agency  so she does freelance  the other five women are predominantly documentary people who work in both photography and film and video  uh they work on projects for uhm non-governmental organizations uh government organizations uhm international governments as well as uhm our own canadian government  so they tend to spread around  all of them have done shoots in foreign countries have done shoots that involved looking at communities and projects although not necessarily in the country that they've shot in for this particular exhibition  the exhibition is current  uh they fin finished   they went off to shoot last uh march  they finished shooting march april may  it was a two-month shoot  uh it cost eight thousand dollars per person   they shot off about a hundred and thirty sometimes a little more rolls of film  so one way or another there're about two thousand roughly two thousand images per photographer  uh cida kept about uh a hundred and seventy-five of them  the rest went back to the photographers which in a way is payment uh cos they didn't make hardly any money uhm doing this job  it was more because it was a really interesting project   but they can then use their photographs  they can sell them  they can re-use them  they can get some income from them  so it's not it's not too bad  uhm what i want to do first of all is i'm going to have you read  the introductory panel very quickly  it tells you what's going on what the whole project's about  cos what i want to do more is look at the photographs  not so much the issues of what they're photographing but how they're photographed to make you understand or not understand as the case may be  so we'll start with this and then i'm going to introduce you to the first photographer and then i'm going to let you go spend about fifteen minutes looking at the other photographers and then  i want to get back together and talk tape recorder stops   one thing i'd like to go over is how this uhm exhibition is curated  it's always important to when you walk into a gallery or where anywhere where images are being hung it's it's so  look at the images but to look at how the images are hung and think about why they're hung in a certain way  uhm often there's a reason  uhm sometimes it's just aesthetic  sometimes it has more to do with uhm a political statement or it can be any way of of communicating an idea that the curator or the artist is trying to present outside of just the image  so first of all what we've done here is we have a very brief  biography on the photographer but we've also included a photograph of each photographer
