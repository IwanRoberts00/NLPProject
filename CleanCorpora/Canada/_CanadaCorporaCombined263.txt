   simon vaselenak is an economics professor at the  universit&eacute; de montr&eacute;al   he is scheduled to be a keynote speaker at the c l s c's centre local de services communautaires annual convention later this week  he doesn't approve of the government's health cuts but at the same time he sees a positive side  one thing that may result from the cuts is the need  the perceived need to do more with less  and one way to do more with less is to prevent rather than to merely cure  so this is a silver lining so to speak  vaselenak says preventing illness before it happens should be a priority in health care   he says it will save a lot of money over the long run  but at the same time vaselenak is worried about people who are already ill  he says they may have to wait longer now for medical services  and that may mean they'll be sicker before they receive treatment  diane daly c b c news montreal  the cross-examination of doctor scott herbert lasted barely half an hour this
