 i'm roger bolton and this hour we're talking about the quebec referendum law  should the law be changed instead of splitting everyone into a no committee and a yes committee  uh we're talking about this in the light of some of the charges by the director general of elections pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; to many people who participated in that canadian unity rally last october uh that uh he considered to be more a serious violation of democracy than the widespread voter fraud  now it's my pleasure to bring in to the studio julius grey who's a constitutional lawyer  and he's a professor of law at mcgill university  julius a pleasure to have you here  oh it's always a pleasure to be here  now julius uhm i spoke of uh earlier the fact that we've challenged the referendum law  beginning of nineteen-ninety-two you represented me when i was the head of the equality party at the time  uh calling this a violation of freedom of expression  the fact that we're forced to participate in one of these two committees  and we can only spend money if approved by one of these two committees  uh the supreme court recently agreed to hear the case  maybe you can outline for our listeners the two competing arguments with respect to quebec's referendum law  we lost the case in the superior court and two   two to one in the court of appeal  so there are two types of judgments  one favourable to us by mister justice bourassa  and one unfavourable uh by justices speaker uses french pronunciation bisson delisle and michaud  but all of the judges all favourable and unfavourable agreed there was a violation of the charter  the uh only question is uh whether this violation of freedom of expression and perhaps even freedom of association is justifiable in a free and democratic society  and there are several positions possible  the extreme position accepted by american courts including the supreme court of the united states is that you can't put spending limits at all  i don't think that would wash in canada  i think spending limits are a reasonable thing  and uh in quebec there are elaborate ways to make sure that there are spending limits  uh for instance only individuals can contribute to any campaign and only up to a certain maximum  whether it's an election or whether it's a referendum  under those conditions then why is it necessary to restrain speech and not let you speak out  given that there is already a a maximum and that there is no way uh corporate and uh union uh dues can be used  what is the reason  and that is what it turns on  whether the prohibition of all expression uh that uh outside the two umbrella committees is a reasonable limitation  i would add too uh what is uh you can't do for instance is tr  i find quite shocking you can't campaign for an abstention  you can't campaign against the question  you couldn't publish a book of essays some of which are for and  some of which are against   okay but let's   but let's stick to the specifics here  let's use the example of uh this past referendum  if one of the groups  if some type of group such as the equality party in this past referendum wanted official status in the no committee to bring up certain arguments and daniel johnson did not want to permit them a platform to bring up so some of those arguments he is perfectly within his right based on the referendum law to block them from holding a rally or distributing material   yes he could be   he can lose with before that committee  that judicial committee but that's for a small amount  and if he acts reasonably uh there's nothing you can do  let me give you an example  suppose some extremist english group had said we want people to vote yes because we want partition now  now can you imagine mister parizeau's and mister bouchard's predicament having to fund people who are coming to say exactly the opposite  but it's no more legitimate  but they're still trying to exact the same answer from the population  a yes vote   they're trying to extract yes   but but of course it can have a counter it can be counter productive   imagine somebody for instance saying technically i'm for the yes or for the no but for such ridiculous reasons that everybody understands that it's really word   but shouldn't they at least have the right to freedom of expression to express that opinion   absolutely absolutely  that's what i'm saying  on the one hand you shouldn't force uh parizeau and bouchard to spend their money on them  but on the other hand it's totally illegitimate in a democracy to prevent somebody from having his his say  so the best solution is to allow groups outside the umbrella committee to speak independently as long as the money is raised uh in the within the limits  so the government's primary argument is that this is the only feasible method of keeping spending under control for a referendum campaign  well that too is of course uh uh highly disputable  there are other countries which have limits on how much you can spend  but no country  there is  we could not find a law as draconian as this in trying to control the type of spending and by whom  uh it's clear i think that uh you could think of a law which is perfectly effective and which doesn't go as far as this one  which is of course one of the leading arguments under the charter  if you're going to violate the charter you have to show that this violation is the minimal one necessary to achieve an important end  and i think you're going to have a hard time with that  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to be part of the program  we're discussing quebec's referendum law  we're gonna going to the phones right now and cam you've been standing by  welcome  cam are you there  have we lost cam peter and  let's try then edward   edward you're on the air  welcome  yes  hi  i have a couple of points to bring up  you know uh don't forget biking is a is a   healthy thing  you know it gives people the opportunity to get together  joseph do you have a comment about the referendum law  we know we've heard you on this program many times  you've actually used other names than edward   so uh what's your comment about the referendum law  so so what do you mean  do i have to use  what i have to use  do i have to give you my mother's name too  laugh what is your comment on the referendum law  ed   don't be so miserable  the people will want to go go out with their bikes one one day a week  okay ed did you have to uh  no but listen  you know that the the sovereignists they want to go to to the united nations for us to be able to look uh at what's going on the next uh uh referendum  did you know that  well for uh do you agree that the probe should be a lot deeper into the alleged uh rejection of no votes  no i think that the united nations should be there the next time so that you don't have any uh false feedbacks  i agree with you   and don't forget that the germans you know in the last war they thought that they would win by propaganda throughout with the radio  it it didn't succeed  the nazis didn't win uh with it  so don't think that you're gonna going to   you know by giving word   you're not gonna going to win nothing  sigh ed i don't understand what you're talking about ed   okay ed we'll see ya you   i think that's not a bad suggestion getting the united nations   to uh to help monitor the next referendum campaign   to make sure   you don't think that's going a bit far word  laugh   uhm  seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to talk about the quebec referendum law  what are your thoughts  do you believe that the existing law should stay in force with all expenses uh being declared under either the no or the yes umbrella  do you believe there should be spending limits on referendum campaigns  what are your thoughts  what are your thoughts about the probe by pierre f c&ocircumflex;t&eacute; about voter fraud  my first guest uh on line is john forest   he is the president of the algonquin college student association  mister forest thank you very much for being with us tonight  not a problem  not a problem at all  mister forest describe for us uh your heinous crime which has led to uh your being charged by quebec's director general of elections  heinous crime laugh   uhm what actually we've done is we've gone to uhm uh the major extreme of renting two buses two voyageur buses to bring students down to montreal where you are uh to stand for their country  crazy crime isn't it  uhm hum  laugh   did you spend the money in ontario or did you spend it in quebec  in ontario  and did the people who actually spent the money go into quebec  uh did the people actually i'm sorry  did anybody actually spend money in quebec to get on the buses   oh yeah   no but on the buses  oh on the buses  uh on the way to quebec or in quebec  no for the buses  did anybody charter buses in quebec  oh i'm not sure  well no but you you didn't  oh we we rented buses in  ottawa   because you see what i'm getting at is that it seems to me on principles of constitutional law that quebec provincial laws in canada are strictly territorial  you can't charge anybody with anything that happened outside the  province   so that's why i'm i'm puzzled by these accusations  right   so that's one important point  let me ask you uh john how did this come about  how did the director general of elections investigate  did they come to see you  did they interview people that were on the bus  how did this charge come about  they came to see us actually in the beginning  uh they sent the uh i guess the the  quebec elections police to come and see us  uh from there they contacted voyageur bus where voyageur uh told uh or i guess surrendered documents stating who actually had rented buses from them that day to attend the rally  so that's how they went about it  now what uh could the consequence of this charge be eventually  was that uh described to you  no it hasn't actually come to us  basically what happens is we got a fine for two hundred and sixty-six dollars stating that we had violated the quebec elections act and uh asking us to pay within thirty days  and you plan do you plan to pay that fine  no no  we're going to plead not guilty to the uh to the  charges and take it from there  and this is in quebec court that you've been charged  yeah   now what  did you raise issues with the director general of elections or you just received this notice from them and you haven't had a chance to question the charge at all  yeah we haven't really questioned it  what i've done actually is sent the the  charge on in paper to my lawyer  uh our lawyer is actually investigating what  exactly what you've just talked about  so they're going to check into everything find out if there's jurisdiction et cetera et cetera  now did you expect this at all when you rented those buses or your rented the bus or your intention at the time was just let's go to montreal  let's plead for canadian unity and that's it  did you ever imagine that this would come about  no not never  never not at all  we never   i mean basically all that ran through everybody's mind
