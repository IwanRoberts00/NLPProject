 high levels of either dramatic critical knowledge or overall domain knowledge differentiate readers from those with little or no relevant  domain knowledge  if you know about the relevant culture and if you are an expert in the particular genre the text relates to then your reading of the text will be different from those without your double level of expertise  on the other hand however cultural and critical expertise together does not necessarily lead to more numerous explanations than emanate from readers with high levels of other types of domain knowledge  overall results   taken as a whole  i guess it's what's called conclusion  about three words   taken as a whole all of these comparisons indicate that experts read differently than non-experts do  hypothesis number one  they also show that experts read more into a text than do non-experts  hypothesis number two  and that knowledge of the relevant culture differentiates readers  hypothesis three  hypothesis four  commonly held ways of reading among experts has not been neatly proven however  word my study produced the finding that expert readings must have specific domain knowledge in order to distinguish themselves as a group from non-experts  belonging to the same group of experts on theory is not enough to differentiate one group of readers from another  so if you take all the semioticians in the room you will not answer as a whole   sorry folks  okay  discussion  these conclusions are consistent with other studies reported on in my book and with experiments conducted by co  cognitive scientists on non-literary texts   to illustrate the latter point let me cite the example of the work of dane bosch   this experimental cognitivist use accounts used accounts of a fictitious baseball game to study the difference between what baseball experts learn and retain when reading and what   non-expert baseball non baseball experts learned and retained from the same text  bosch found that high knowledge subjects reported larger chunks of information and recalled more propositions than did low knowledge subjects  high knowledge subjects also described textual events in more   graphi graphically and with more variety than did the low knowledge group  the conclusions bosch drew from his full-scale study full-scale study about knowledge levels and reading recall of a non-literary text could very well be applied to what i have found when studying the reception of a literary text  according to both these studies domain-related concepts of the high knowledge individual are more differentiated than the concepts of the  no lo low knowledge individual  furthermore high knowledge individuals have a much greater knowledge of contingent relations and are more adept at using this knowledge than are those with low domain knowledge  in general then those who read either non-literary or literary texts reveal similar patterns of reading and understanding  there are commonly held concepts and ways of reading within and between different groups of readers  there is a difference between the perceptions of nine na&iuml;ve readers and those of literary readers literary experts   literary critics as do other informed readers read differently than do non-informed readers  my empirical research into reader response has provided some useful insights into the role of interpretive strategies the significance of critical knowledge domain specific critical expertise and the role of culture in the reading process  it also points to answers some of the questions i first posed in nineteen eighty-nine in an article that appeared in linguika called  the reader as expert   and if you look at the book summary you'll see that i have the last chapter is called the reader as expert part two   and the book is really a response to that whole  that article that appeared in nineteen eighty-nine  literary critics do have expertise that distinguishes them from non-critics  literary critics tend to respond consistently as a group and therefore have expertise that is not idiosyncratic  literary critics pick up the same text markers that other readers do but they do so more frequently and more consistently than do na&iuml;ve readers  but colleagues beware  these results should be considered tentative and incomplete  my samples were relatively small and there are many interesting calculations and cross-calculations which could only have been  deter determined from a very large  large scale study  studies of the kind i conducted might very well need to be completely redesigned should new critical models and different testing methods emerge  with time and further research we will also learn to pose other questions  to what degree for example do informed readers propose answers which are probably accurate or likely to be believed as opposed to those spontaneously arrived at  do critics behave more often as problem solvers than as expert readers   does a change of context in a text make a difference to the use of reading strategies  so many questions  so few answers  in the context of reader response to literature and the performance of critics as experts the eye of the beholder holds and contemplates many mysteries yet to be solved  thanks applause   the geography of women is really just a first step though a necessary one because the real problem about incorporating women into geography lies not with word empirical research but at the theoretical and analytical level   the copious quantities of new descriptive and empirical material on women had been collected using traditional geographic word  assumptions methodologies and paradigms  in the early nineteen eighties it became apparent that in order to analyze this new content women a new analytical framework feminism was needed  feminist geography is therefore faced with the much larger task of reworking and redefining geographic theory   so what is feminist geography   just as there isn't one definition of feminism  or even geography there is also no one definition of the intersection of these two things   i define feminist geography as a study which explores dynamic interrelations between space and gender   on the one hand the social construction of gender effects the  ways and extents to which women and men influence and create  their lives   on the other hand space structures and creates  existing word forms of gender relations   as julianne rowes and lars allen point out geographers have long word that landscapes are cultural constructs but they've never considered the ways in which gender is involved in this process   the geography of women is a necessary precursor for the entrance of feminist geography into human geography but it wasn't a sufficient one  feminist geography also emerged at a certain point in the history of geography when similar developments were taking place   uh this paper has had a interesting pre-life already  uh it was written up in the local newspaper the haige  standard as an example of the wacky things the arcane esoteric subject matter  that that academics get up to and in a long list of titles culled from the various learned sessions that started with   loam roman latrines and worked through i don't know sewage systems or something mine was the ultimate wacky topic at the very end and it's a and professor lincolnshire reef is working on gender panic and aesthetically enhanced subjects in cyberpunk  i guess the uh the only really good benefit to come out of it was that uh i was elevated to full professor which is quite a jump from audience laughter from   graduate student so   at least  maybe the english department hasn't found out yet though  i'm expecting the cheque so  uhm there's an irony to that as well to this idea that uh the paper for all that it has this kind of esoteric uh topic matter or title uhm is actually dealing with a form and a subgenre that is very popular  uhm the novel i'll be speaking of principally today neuromancer by william gibson at last look had gone through about fifteen editions has spawned an entire subgenre of material  there are cyberpunk films that are watched by the populous at large  i guess robocop might be one of the best known ones or   or blade runner  uh there's musical attached to it  there's almost a lifestyle that's become attached to it  uhm and so we're talking about something that that  is extremely populist uh a and  not particularly esoteric  at least perhaps not as esoteric as roman latrines   so from beginning from that irony let me begin  we are approaching the asyntotic limit of gender   not the collapse of sexual difference but the ever-receding point at which differences verge on but new do not become self-identical   in the information age the body and the irregular formations of gender which accrete about it are effaced become bits of data with no greater epistemological charge than any other bit of data circulating through our modems and microprocessors  homo datum retains only the irreducible trace of gender  people hooked into the network of databases electronic uhm bulletin boards and mailboxes exist as identities free of reference to their bodies  computer hackers indulge in the opportunity to leave behind the meat of their physical form and sing the body electric  in the net no one can tell if you're black or white male or female young or old oppositions which have a declining relevance once freed of the imperium of the gaze   well the technology of gene splicing and virtual reality software tend towards its eclipse much recent feminist critical theory has been concerned with the role of gender in the construction of gender and identity  teresa de laurentis for example reconfigures foucault's analysis of the technology of sexuality to include the problem of sexual difference  concluding that gender is quote the product and the process of a number of social technologies of technosocial or biomedical apparati   donna haraway's well-known essay a manifesto for cyborgs however perceives the emancipatory potential of the new technologies  in a self-consciously ironic move geared to disconcert those who would pledge allegiance in however mediated a sense to the goddess of a natural femininity  haraway embraces the figure of the cyborg the assemblage of the  o organic and the inorganic of human consciousness and machine agency which blurs the notion of a unitary autonomous and self-aware subject  the cyborg for haraway is quote illegitimate   it quote skips the step of original unity of identification with nature and thus has no trouble with bisexuality pre-oedipal symbiosis unalienated labour or other seductions to organic wholeness  cyborgs of course are not simply the products of a technosocial or biomedical apparati  they are creations of imagination particularly women's fiction   the monster of mary shelley's frankenstein eighteen eighteen but not strictly speaking a cyborg remains the most resonant myth of technology's illegitimate offspring the creature that is not human yet is not animal or machine   frankenstien is also considered by many to be the first true science fiction story and it is not surprisingly science fiction that has been one of the most effective literary forms for drawing into question and problematizing the oppositions of mind body organism machine developed primitive and man woman   cyberpunk the most recent aesthetic revolution in science fiction is as its hybrid tag indicates particularly concerned with the breakdown between the human and the machine that has been the hallmark of late twentieth century post-industrial capitalism   the term cyberpunk signifies less a set of  shared formal and aesthetic devices or even social and political concerns  so much as it does a range of literary styles and themes which only occasionally overlap  its arrival as a full grown movement was announced by the furore of critical accolades and prizes for william gibson's first novel neuromancer which came out in nineteen eighty-four and then by  bruce ber bruce sterling's manifesto-like preface to a cyberpunk anthology entitled mirrorshades which came out in nineteen eighty-eight  in this preface sterling notes two recurrent sources of fascination in cyberpunk  and this will give you some sense of the kind of topic matter that the subgenre deals with  sterling writes the theme of body invasion prosthetic limbs implanted circuitry cosmetic surgery genetic alteration   quote continues   the radical redefinition of the self this is the project which  cyber punk shares with postmodernism and feminism and the form's acute awareness being wrought by advanced computer technology allows it to investigate the problems of self in startling new ways  not surprisingly then the connection there has been a connection drawn between the post or anti-humanist projects of cyberpunk postmodernism and feminism and elicited a critical linkage between the three  in her recent article cybernetic deconstructions cyberpunk and postmodernism veronica hollinger puts cyberpunk in the context of the feminist science fiction of the mid seventies and early eighties the  anti-humanist sensibility she calls it evident in the works of ursula le guin joanna russ and jody scott
