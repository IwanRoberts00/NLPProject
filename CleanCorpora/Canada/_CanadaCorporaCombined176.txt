 okay  so on the fourteenth we have a staff meeting   yup   last week's meeting   i'll tell i'll fill you in a bit  we started talk talking   it was a maybe two words meeting right   as opposed to a team staff meeting  ya   so uhm gerald uh chaired and we were talking about protocol and fonction d'&eacute;quipe and stuff  anyway he was just saying commending us he says that it's since our last meeting it's been going very well you know between the two offices  that's nice he had something positive to say  ya  and then uhm but he said you know there's still a lack of communication between you know tori and i so that we have to work on  so we talked about like any problems and stuff  and amelie brought up the fact that when we sat down that friday to talk about the dossier   how good how interesting it was  ya ya   it was  ya  and i said you know  so i mentioned that the whole problem that we don't have time to evaluate cos we're always running  and i said and some of that has come from the fact that we don't have a lot of overtime accumulated anymore  we've been really good at taking time back and stuff   ya   so i said you know so now we we  push a f fifty sixty  hour work week which we used to work sixty hours and  accumulate all that time in thirty-five hours so obviously a lot of our time is now spent out of the office running around   ya   so he wrote all these things down  and so we started talking about december  he said he didn't reali realize  he didn't know that we were gonna   going to take december to evaluate which  which we mentioned a few months ago  ya  we've mentioned quite a few times  so  what do you think about that   he likes it  he really likes it  he thinks it might not be  well uh first he said two weeks is too much and we said are you kidding  like uh we think that that's going to be  a shame   if we have to sit down and do it we did it just for dossier femme and   that was part of dossier femme   there wasn't even a full one   mm hmm   you know   and so there's you know there's  a lot to talk about there's a lot to discuss  we wanna want to spend time in cleaning the offices and organize ourselves and stuff  i said you know two weeks should be okay   so he i no i noticed that he wrote down all the notes about uhm french and stuff   and and how maybe we uh you know it's very hard to say no and it's very hard to plan in your  in advance because we were talking about those things  mm hmm   how they're great but things come up  the n d g notre-dame-de-gr&acircumflex;ce rapist we didn't know was going to happen and a lot of our time this summer was devoted to that  ya  we didn't know we were gonna going to   be inundated with home security visits  no  so you know there's a fine line between planning planning and precisely and then   y you can't plan precisely for a year  no   that's our job to answer whatever the   community community's needs are  mm hmm   but it gives you a good base to find out you know what should be done when  ya   ya  but  so uhm we started talking about evaluating and i'm not sure how how to do this  should i sit down with every staff member and start the process  should i fill out a form  like should i make a form that you guys fill out on each project and put it together  do we sit down   well that's what amelie used to do right  mm hmm  she used to fill out a form  but i don't know if it should be as much as the whole team together on one project because not not  everybody's involved in every project  maybe the people involved  like we did amelie you and i for the uhh  the walks  ya   ya  because each one of us had a different view on things and oh ya this happened oh ya this happened   if we were a few words   at the end of the day it  it's still not put on paper word   no i don't know if she did or not  i haven't even  i started at the hospital but i never got a chance to  uh to finish it  ya   i have all my notes though  that's all   because i i wan   want   it's it's still it's it's still  very hard to put down on paper  ya i know i know  because where did it start and where does it finish is  ya  cos i i wanna want to  have written reports on the whole year  it's gonna going to be more  uh i mean if you want i could still do it on paper and it's going to be more like a graph at one point where which   communities did what and what's to come  the future outcome of it   ya   ya   okay i have   where's the word   because if we do if we take our activities  this isn't even it   exasperated breath   you know the database that i made   ya  i don't have the full one  you never gave me the full one  i gave you mine  okay   plus the board of directors want a report on what we've been doing  so sniff this is a   i think it would also be great for the uhm next year the end of the year i mean if we do this two words   so if i take  like autograph won't take a whole day but but  everyone should be able to evaluate it and what we wanna  want to do next year  like is it something we wanna want to  continue  you know do we wanna want to push  lacombe lamonde to have it on a regular basis  do we not  so we wanna want to try like you know  so if we go alphabetically   there's some things that well there's some things that   okay like autographs should everybody individually  i think autograph ya because everyone's supposed to know how to do it and everyone has done it now  ya   okay so that's an an example autograph everybody does it   uh let's say you do make up some some  type of form for activities that are like that anything you can think of and we write it down and then we get together and  compare notes and then that's when we evaluate the program as a whole  ya   ya  that's a good idea  and then banking security project well obviously that'll be you and jack sitting down  mm hmm   but i mean i i think that  everyone anyone can be invited you know what  i mean  like what if what if earl  has a great idea about banking security or what if he  oh ya   no i think everybody should do it  i'm not saying that we shouldn't get together  maybe like if  let's say we take those two weeks  ya  okay  let's take the first uhm four days to individually do our things  and then like let's say the bank thing it wouldn't be individually  ya   mm hmm   it would be me and jack   ya   but it's not including the whole gang  no  and then we bring it back to the whole  the whole gang and just decide is it worth it is it not uh what what should we do next year if we have to do it again and   ya   which means this form should be out to everyone soon  because i'd like to give you all a couple of weeks to look it through and think   mm hmm   well that's it cos you're not gonna going to  be able to do like all of our activities in four days   or three days  no   no  but this is a m   but i mean we should spend the  we should do this now and spend the last two weeks together evaluating them together  yup yup   well what would be some things that you'd want to tell  in the evaluating what would be some things that you would want   everyone to know let's say with autograph   you know what i mean  like the sheet'll say autograph   uhm  what i wanna want to do about it is go through the files and see how many sessions were done how many cars  were done throughout the year  that's for my that's for my end of   year   ya   uhm  the best part of it the worst part of it how much time was used to prepare  i don't know  i don't know what types of questions word    ya but and half of the  half the paper has to be just general comment  yup  uhm   okay   because autograph it's not something that we do just by ourselves  lacombe lamonde does all the publicity  ya  uhm it doesn't take as much time to prepare  right sniff   but when we get there and we see that the publicity hasn't been done right and you don't get any cards it's very frustrating so is it worth you know like what should what should we do at this point  ya   like new ideas  like they could be apart from new ideas  do we take this on ourselves  well now because earl and jack have been trained we can do it ourselves  like do next summer do we wanna  want to do the cars here in the parking lot  ya  do we wanna want to you know approach queen meredith hospital  ya  these type of things   yup   but okay so general comments   okay  and then each each activity will have a sheet   ya  i think you should ask marte for her  uhm the sheet that she got  she already  old evaluation  ya  it was kind of like uhm clicking noise  you know uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm   like the activity report right  i think so  i think so  but i don't think we need all that information  no  or maybe we do i don't know   but we already have it  that's what those uh those  one-page things are for to look back on  for me anyway  ya   i think it shouldn't be as detailed as that  no  should be more  maybe it should just be a blank sheet with autograph  what does one person think about it and then i don't know  that could be   and just in a box somewhere take into con  consideration uh pre  preparation uh the the day itself  just to give you ideas you know cos when you start you might forget a certain thing and if you see it there   preparation the day itself  what about strengths and weaknesses or you think everyone will know to put them in   no   put it put it in as a you know  strengths weaknesses   just to help you get started on it  ya   outcome   outcome   eventually too what i'd like to do is remember we had the uhm  you know the other office who did uh what all the activities are like  what you have to me what you need to prepare   mm hmm  eventually if this can go into a binder and then slowly as the year progresses  like what is autograph you know like  what what what do you need blah blah blah blah  ya   ya  like that would just take that would be a paragraph   so eventually if someone new comes in  you give them work two words  laugh   okay  well that would make sense  and then everyone gets a copy to fill out  ya   ya   then we sit down and we   on everything  uhm   i mean you don't even have to make a sheet with  autograph on it  just make blank sheets with with the uhm uhm just saying the title of it and then the few ideas what to consider and give each person a list of what they should be filling out   because the bank pamphlet  won't you know  ya   oh ya   ya
