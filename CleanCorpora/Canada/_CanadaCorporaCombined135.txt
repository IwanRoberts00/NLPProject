 if your kids are bigger than that you know that won't work and uhm  the the hardest thing i found i remember we used to get questions about this and i never realized what a problem it was is for boys and i imagine for girls but i'm the mother of boys who reach a certain age where their size is bigger than their age  my my older son is only ten but he's already five feet tall wears a size seven men's shoe and he's not a man he's a little boy  right   it's worse for girls actually  { > oh really   for guys you really can get away with putting them in a man's pants putting them in a man's running suit it's not going to make a difference  when you take a little girl and you try and put her in a  ladies' size five or seven it ain't isn't   gonna going to work because she's a different shape  so it's much harder for the girls and there's less to buy cos again you want them to look like a little girl but the ladies'  stuff is gonna going to be much too mature  that's true   so you're really lucky that you have boys  uhm it's it's sort of easier yeah  and the men's shoes you still can get a boot you know  that that looks good on him a slip on a tie shoe that's  gonna going to look like a kid could wear it   so   can you get running shoes for example most of the kids wear running shoes i guess periodi  periodically once a year they wear loafers uh can you get running shoes at at the cheap price good shoes at the great prices that you can see sometimes in the states  no laugh laugh okay   laugh   uh again schreter's has running shoes it's one of the places to get them  uhm the sales in the sports stores you know sports experts and all those will feature sales  if you if you watch those flyers that come in every week they will have certain models at fifty-nine dollars or sixty-nine dollars and you know if you transfer that into a u s price and  you're not going to get much in the u s for forty bucks in a running shoe  so you're almost in the same price range  so those are the kind of sales you look for  eaton's will do the same thing the bay they will feature a nike a reebok you know one or two of their lines and if your kid will accept that that's about the only way you're going to do it here  jenny our lines are filled so that our time for chatting is up  laugh   we're gonna going to take a break and then we'll uh let the callers at ya you   seven two nine
