 and how they uhm gather up the grapes   mhh hmm   and took us inside and showed us the machines and all   this stuff   mhh hmm   and actually it was quite surprising because they do quite a bit of stuff by hand there   do they   ya  and then we had a tasting you know taste-testing  mhh hmm   cos i've been to few of them  ya  california  okay okay  ya  napa valley word   oh okay  oh well then you know this  uh huh   uhh so ya we got to taste different  things   testing is the most fun  ya ya  i've been to the mumm's cham  champagne plant or whatever   oh okay   mhh hmm   and uhm so anyways we ended up buying some stuff cos it was really very very good and i'm so diappointed when i buy wine here a lot of the   times   mhh hmm   you know cos i'm not an expert you know   did you get a good price because you were at the plant  i'm just curious  or was it the same price as the liquor store  well they can't sell to the liquor stores here  because the taxes are so high that it wouldn't uhh  it it wouldn't make their product competitive with the other products  mhh hmm  so you have to buy it there   and uh their their wines  were around they're around ten dollars a bottle  cough   mhh  but they were really good  mhh hmm  i mean i just recently bought a chardonnay a french chardonnay and i paid ten dollars and it was so bad  mhh hmm   it tasted like  vinegar   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and i used it for cooking  i wasn't gonna going to drink it  it w was it was lousy  cough really  it was really really lousy  ya   and so i used it for cooking  i mean ten dollars  you know it was just like throwing it  away   ya   wow   so what we wanna want to do is stock up on some of that wine out there and bring it home so that we  we have it for when you know  we we have  people or go somewhere or  something like that  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  but it was really very good  but at this place we didn't go to the dinner but they have these special dinners there  like medieval dinner or   oh they oh ya  oh do they  yup   so they have this kind of medieval setting and the  food and all this   ya   uh huh that's fun   ya i thought that would be fun  and i think they have a mystery one too  murder mystery or something like that   mhh hmm   ya  i always wanted to go  i've been to a medieval one  oh have you   st helen's island  oh  they had one at st helens island they had one with   i don't know that one   it's very   oh best two words there   oh ya  but the murder mystery one it's quite expensive  oh is that right  i think so  their price was about i think it was thirty-five dollars  mhh hmm  and it included well your whole meal and the entertainment but you only got one drink  the murder mystery   that's not bad   you know one glass of wine  that's not bad  ya  cos i thought it would be much more than that  oh is that right  mhh hmm  but i think this is the medieval one  i don't know about the murder mystery  mhh ohh   or maybe they're all the same price  i can't remember  but thirty- five dollars   cough uh huh  that was that was the price  that uh i remember seeing  ya  hmm  but they have other ones out there too  and there's this other kind of wine which is called uhm   well in french they call it hydro-miell&eacute;   hydro wi wine  honey or i don't know  anyways it's wine made of honey  and uhm this is apparently this old greek method for making wine  the greeks made wine out of honey   mhh hmm   and so then they've started doing it out there  cough mhh  and other people have cider  mhh hmm   and you know all sorts of different things  like it seems like   was it was it  busy  it wasn't busy busy but i mean there was a group before us  maybe with about ten people  cough   and there were about ten or twelve people in our group as well   mhh hmm that many   ya   how'd you find out about it  uhm i had some brochures about it so i knew but  i had never tried to find it  before   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   so this day you know i think we drove by and we said hey there's one of those wineries  why don't we stop   well they say this past weekend was  beautiful  like this past weekend was so beautiful   mhh hmm hmm   and the weekend or not before the weekend  two weekends ago we climbed mont tremblant  mhh hmm   we went hiking up mont tremblant with a group of friends  mhh hmm   that was beautiful   oh i bet   ya it's been gorgeous   you would have loved  i should have invited you to come   mhh   i forgot   next time  cough i will   next time   ya   you would like to do that eh   ya give me a call   i'd love to   i bet  i'd love to  no but the only thing is with school and stuff you know i  i don't know if it would have been a good weekend for me  because one weekend michael went with a bunch of his friends and i couldn't go   okay  and they had a beautiful time   okay okay   it might have been that weekend   probably   probably was  because i've seen the pictures  you know they're great  oh ya   ya  but ya give me a call and you know if you guys  are are   doing something like that   uh huh   mhh hmm mhh hmm   cos i'd i'd love to go and if i don't have too much homework  mhh   ya  yup  well this weather's so nice  oh it's great  ya  i hope it stays you know for for ever  ya laugh   laugh it's true  ya  but uhm ya so i don't know about this weekend  i heard it's supposed to start raining on wednesday or something like this  i thought oh no   but i won't be here so i don't care  this tomorrow   mhh hmm   ya when do you leave  friday morning at seven o'clock in the morning  oh wow  how long does it take to get there   i don't know  we have to stop in toronto  mhh hmm   and then we fly to san fransisco  mhh hmm  and then we take a little plane in to reno  so i'm coming back on sunday  wow   isn't that crazy  mhh  so we won't be able to do much  mhh hmm  but nevertheless it'll be fun  oh ya   stil fun to go out and   i've been to san fransisco so it's not i don't  feel as though i've i'm gonna  going to be there and not tour  around   no   mhh hmm  right   i mean it would be nice to stay longer  but uh one of those things  ya   quite the jetsetter aren't i  ya that's right   ya no kidding  gee   well but it's nice that you can do that anyway  it's like freddy said if he's only got one brother i mean it's not the kind of thing that's going to happen  much huh  if he wants to go   no   so i'm  or maybe ever again you know   ya   mhh hmm  so and you know what the days just go by  and the weeks  mhh hmm   my gosh we'll soon be planning for christmas   word right  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   it's october   it's just it's scary  i can't believe it  remember last year we were in the class  it's like a whole year   mhh hmm  a whole year went by   i guess it's really scary  mhh hmm  sometimes you think oh my god  oh i know   no i think well in one month i'll be starting my practicum   can't believe it  and one of our teachers who said today well you know half of my course is finished now  mhh  and we went what  uh huh  and he said well you're going to be going into the schools in november so i'm not going to see you for that whole  month   and then you come back in december and you write your final exam  uh huh   mhh hmm   mhh  so actually his material is half finished  wow   mhh hmm  and it doesn't seem like we've done hardly anything  uh huh   are you you're planning on taking your master's in the summer   like after if you finish in april you know are you you going to start taking courses immediately  i might  mhh hmm  you know maybe two or something  why not eh   like i don't know if i'll be able to get a job  you know if i can't work in the summer i might as well be doing something  right  might as well   mhh hmm  but i don't want to do it   you know like this last summer i was a little bit busy  i had three courses  uh huh   i don't think i'd take more than two  maybe   mhh hmm   and then maybe i'd try to get a little bit of part-time work  here and there  because i'm starting to hear names of places and  from people  and things   ya   mhh hmm   and i'll probably try applying to some of these uhm  private companies  that sort of thing  and just see what happens   or may sometimes they have these intensive summer courses too  that might be a possibility as well   to take or to teach  to teach  somebody phoned me to teach  one this summer  cough   where   oh really  ya  but i couldn't do it because i was going on holidays then the last two weeks of august  mhh hmm  and i really needed the holidays cos the rest of the time  i was studying  so   i would   sure   well you really do  you really do  ya  so i said uh no laugh   no thanks laugh   mhh hmm   was it for a company  it was actually one of my teachers for uhm education  i did this uh practicum with her which was a lot of work  mhh hmm  i remember you had mentioned it   and she phoned me up and told me that she knew somebody who was looking for somebody and i just i   i didn't even talk to her  she left me the message on the answering machine and i just  phoned her back and i left her a mesh message  saying that uhm thank thank you very much for calling but i'm going to be on holidays  and you know i didn't go into it  mhh hmm   i did quite a lot of work with mel  about mel 's wedding last week when i was down   i went to see the dressmaker   did you like her  very much  i think she's very good   that's the colour of the uh bridesmaids' dresses  do you like that  it's kind of a cranberry colour  well it's a nice uh colour for christmastime isn't it  ya it is  i mean it's not my favourite colour but mel loves it  oh that's good  this is this this funny woman  she uhm she's a designer  uhh i think she designs probably more for the the  young and the slim than the middle age mothers of the bride  but   mhh hmm   i liked her stuff very much  > melanie 's dress that's she's made for mel   it it's beautiful  it really is word   she's made it already  ya  just about finished  really  and what ah ah   very very simple   no uh she doesn't want melanie doesn't want a veil on it   doesn't really go anyway  we'll do the decorating flowers   well hers is white   ya  well ivory   ya and and  this is this is for the bridesmaids   that's for the bridesmaids  and   all of them  mary and  including mary
