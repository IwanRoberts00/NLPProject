 god i not that anyone would ever come up with such an idea  no no nobody would and they certainly would never get it to a publisher  and actually get published in a series of three books  laugh   no i mean   they would certainly ne  never if they came up with it> they'd  ne never  they'd never write about it  glossy covers  ya  i'd you know how'd they get it there  anyways i show you to th i

borrow it again  well i why well when we're finished  uh in here we i i  can photocopy it right on the machine out  there   okay   okay   this is eighty-eight  ya   i mean i've got i've got uh  there's a new statscan statistics canada coming out   in uh huh in this fall this fall with new research  and not only that but it's been coordinated with i think thirteen countries are doing it ah with comparable testing tools  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  do you know what the rate of illiteracy is in canada  ya i do but it's at home  i don't i don't have the stats in my head right now  no   and ya see there's two definitions of illiteracy  i i'm sure there must be at  least two definitions  there's illiterate functionally illiterate   are there only three or four   three or four levels   i i can check it out   illiterate functionally illiv   illiterate   and literate  and visiting professor  oh no there's illiterate literate functionally illiterate and then there's visiting professor  mhh hmm   laugh   laugh   i think some of them have really   well maybe they're not illiterate but they're non-standard english  visiting professors  laugh   laugh   who laugh   laugh ya   what about our non-standard engli  english   what do you mean ee ah uh they're they're   not mother tongue speakers of english   ya we have several professors ya yup ya   non-mother tongue speakers ya   i see what the joke is now yes   ya   there's some professors too for that matter   ya ya ya   like that ryan babcock guy  oh man   whoa laugh he is tough to understand  laugh   laugh well ya he's a  he's always speaking with one accent or another  ya ya  ya cough   this is a this is another   really major article   you know like they're saying dyslexia is like is  is basically a crock and  hmm   it's it's really wild  this is like so exciting for me to read  hmm   this is better than anything i got in the education   journals   mhh   mhh hmm   much better  i it's lightyears away  from it   mhh hmm mhh hmm   this like just nails it  and of course it's it's it's stuff that's come out rather recently  this one is oh this one's eighty-six  this is old you know   mhh hmm   you know i can't believe i didn't have these  i didn't i didn't know and you know  when did we do that course together   nineteen ninety-one   it was around ninteen ninety-one or two eh  cough   ya and we didn't have those articles  no we didn't have these at all   ya useless   and so i'm trying to figure out now how to put them  and you know this is mostl  mostly well this is journal of educational psychology   this is uhm reading research quarterly  i think i had a few articles from reading research quarterly  mhh hmm  but   do you know the people who wrote them  like are they big names   i do know some of the names like stanovich and there's another person uhm that i had heard of uh schticht   and in fact some of the stuff i've research not researched  was quoted  ya  ya in other articles  hmm  but the people i'm really excited about are the uh the   leibermann leibermann and leibermann  people  mhh hmm   wow look at this   see the importance of using meaning-based strategies in addition to code-based strategies for reading instruction is fully acknowledged by code-oriented advocates but not uhm  not whole-language reading   mhh hmm   and now they're sort of saying it  oh we never excluded uh explicit phonetics  well gee look and goodwin your founder  mhh hmm  you know he he just  completely said  there's no way   ya   there's something very appealing about   wh whole just calling   something whole language you know  but you see i say the the the way that i teach explicit phonetics is whole language because it uses all four  language skills listening speaking reading and writing  mhh hmm mhh hmm   mhh hmm mhh hmm  sure  and and that's  the thing with uh the whole language is you don't just isolate it where you're passively reading all the time but you discuss what you're  reading and you   mhh hmm   that type of uh  ya  i mean really whole language is i think what any good teacher does once the kids can read  and you know getting them  mhh hmm   and even at the earliest levels of reading that's what they do  you know like when you're reading dr seuss  with with your child you say like huh look at that what's that animal oh isn't he funny  looking oh   mhh hmm   ya ya   you know  you're engaging them in the process  it's not just  that reminds me of something because there's a  cough one of the women in the faculty here she  came across a dr seuss book for people in management  what laugh   ya believe it or not   and and the i don  don't my information is very sketchy   but it maybe it's a dr seuss type of book or a do somebody's adapted a dr seuss book  but apparently it's brilliant  really  ya ya  and so i wanna want to i just  you just remin reminded     well he did he did  pretty good with that page about dad eh  dad is sad very very sad   ya  dad had a bad day  what a day dad had   laugh   laugh and everybody loves it  you know what i mean  ya ya   you don't have to be a five year-old  no  ya  that reminds me have you have are you seeing any  of the current disney movies  no  have you   like poc  pocahontas or lion king  or anything like that  no   no >  aladdin uh uh  sleeping beauty no  you haven't seen aladdin  no  ohh rent it  robin williams is a scream  it is such  he's pretty good in the frog prince too  oh he's very good  i mean he was very good in mrs doubtfire  ya   uhh   i haven't seen that either  oh you gotta have got to  see it   laugh   that's an incredibly good movie  ya but   it's funny without being silly  that's ya that's   ah i mean i love funny movies but i don't like silly movies  ya  i mean silly movies just bore me to death  but i thought aladdin was amazing  wake up and smell the hummus   you gotta have got to  when he says that i just i just fall off my chair  it's uh this is extremely funny  laugh   and uh mrs doubtfire is really really good too  you know the idea of mrs doubtfire  ya   he's a nanny  ya to get close to his kids or  cos he wants to be close to his kids   and at one point he's in he uh he's  upstairs in in this house in his   in his house although his his  wife doesn't know who who he really is or who he-she really is  and uhm he's having a leak alright and the bathroom door's open  and he's dressed as a woman and he  and he looks compl  completely very convincing you  know and he's he's in the bathroom standing up at the toilet and he's hoisting up his dress so he can pee you know like a man and laugh one of the children walks by and sees this  woman laugh with these hairy legs  dress all hoisted up and peeing into the toilet  ya   ya   ya   laugh   i mean it's just what it does to your mind  is is extremely cute and funny  because it's you know you're so shocked  because it's so out of context  ah   ya ya ya   you really don't see you know women don't do it like that you know   well not the ones that i know laugh   anyways very very funny  laugh   more research laugh   ya ya   and i went to see lion king like cos i i   like kids' movies  they often are quite fun  mhh hmm  and uhm i didn't like it  i thought it was trying too hard  ya   and it was it was  actually it was kinda kind of sexist in some ways  i thought it was a little  ya   did you see pocahontas  i saw pocahontas  it's supposed to really not be very good compared to the others   uhm i liked it more than the lion king  oh that's interesting   at least they made an effort to show the white man as being not all > his  history the history </} books cooked him up to be  you know   ya ya   and uh but still i i prefer the old movies cos i find the kids' movies now no matter what are political  they're all political  and they're a they're all trying to satisfy everybody's everybody's ev  every you kn know  every lobbyist out there  they're trying to say okay we've taken care of that we've taken care of this  and i just uh i don't like these modern movies  they're they're not there isn't  enough fantasy in them  ya  uh people complained about a lot of movies as being sexist and this and that but you know pinocchio snow white and the seven dwarf not " dwarfs" jungle book  i mean kids don't think of them as being sexist or whatever you know   no no   i i remember when i was   i was talking with somebody about fairy tales  and you know i don't show this to my children  they're so sexist   and i said you know i read fairy tales all my life  i just identified with the guy that was riding off on the charger  mhh  i could identify with both depending on  you know it wasn't a problem for me   ya what's what's   ya we can't look at it through adults' eyes you know  when a kid is five or six years old or eight years old or ten years old i they're not  they're not they don't look  it's just not that way   i mean and i don't think they're words  x   i mean they say that that   the the little girls were conditioned then to be passive and comb their hair and wait for their prince you know  well huh maybe if it's reinforced  ya   mhh hmm  but i i never i never saw a problem like that  me neither  i mean it's i shouldn't e  even say anything because it's men  are usually the ones who are   i think it's i mean i think it's great what's happening in today's literature  and you know like the paperbag princess and  everything   ya   ya   but to to sort of put down that whole fairy tale thing  oh i was at a rummage sale and i saw a red fairy book and i was really tempted to buy it but i just said jenny you've got enought junk to take care of  ya   ya you have a very significant library if i remember correctly  cough   and i i've been unloading you know  i'm gonna going to have to unload more  ya  i have way too much too much stuff  ya you need a librarian and an executive secretary  a secretary and   and a wife  cos you don't even know how   you need a wife  ya ya we all could use one of those  whoops i'm not allowed to say that  i can't say that   laugh   i can say it  ya   we can all use one of those  ya  laugh   i need laugh   i need what  actually i need another one of me
