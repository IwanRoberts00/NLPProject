 and so then we started looking on the map and we had gone in a big circle  oh really laugh   we were almost back to our hotel  if we had walked the opposite way we would have come to this store laugh bef  before   poor bernie   he was just dragging his butt  laugh oh no   he was so tired laugh   well i can relate to bernie   i've got i've got a few friends who like nothing more than walking for like f f   forty hours a day you know  oh ya  and uh  it's not your bag  no  well me and the television converter have a very strong personal relationship so   laugh oh dear   bernie walks about four kilometers a day now but he didn't used to  uhm at that time he uh he  spends a lot of of time in the vertical position with the the channel changer in his hand too  well if you're in the vertical position you still don't have it right  you have to be lying down on the couch  that's the way to do it  mhh   no i try and and make sure that he isn't  horizontal because if he is i know he's going to be there for  hours laugh   laugh   laugh   no he likes uh rodeos and uh rodeos and uh sports and uh rodeos laugh   laugh   we were in calgary at the same time as the calgary stampede a couple of years ago and we didn didn't   we avoided all of the all of the  stuff  i kinda kind of wish we'd gone to see something but   my family had flown out for a vacation and they brought my  my little sister along   mhh hmm   and it was her first time in b c british columbia   and they picked me up in nelson  well i i joined and we went on the island possibly vancouver island and drove around  went to calgary so my sister could fly back to ontario  and we're staying in this nice hotel  the sheraton or something   mhh   this was when my parents were bit better off you know  go to go to eat in the restaurant there at the sheraton hotel there's a the  ma&icircumflex;t ma&icircumflex;tre d's got a cowboy hat and one of those silly little tie things  word   tie  you know string tie   you know a huge honking belt buckle  and he was leading us to the table he  he taps this plastic cow head which goes moooo  laugh   and they serve us the biggest juiciest steak ever  isn't it huge  ya  uhh   it was it was too much  i couldn't eat it   ya   i don't think anybody could eat a sixteen ounce steak  i mean that is massive   far more than any one person needs  ya  ya actually the stampede is interesting but uh when you've spent forty years going to rodeos and watching em  them   like he gets the video rodeo tape once a month and uh he watches em them   ya   a video rodeo tape laugh   of all the rodeos on the north america continent   laugh i'm certain of it   i've never heard of such a thing  ya   but he he i suppose because he's   he was involved in rodeos as a young man   he he's uh he's looking more for the technical aspects of of the rides and stuff  okay   and so he's far more into it than i am  for me it's watching a rodeo a   after watching so many it's like watching grass grow  so not very interesting laugh   laugh   well it depends on the kind of grass you know   ya   different grasses grow different   well he always gives me a bad time you see cos i i used to have a ceramics studio and i taught people how to do ceramics  awright alright   and so he he'd say well we go to ceramics shows and we you know we go to ceramic dealers where you get your greenware and things like that and i put up with that  ya at least things move at a rodeo  come on  well ya but you know laugh at least you can use some talent or some abilities  with laugh   laugh   laugh oh boo boo bad attitude mina     laugh uh dear  so we finally came to ah a mutual agreement  that he would go to his rodeos and i would go to the ceramic stores  you know laugh   and never the twain shall meet   not if he can help it laugh   laugh   and actually not if i can help it either laugh   i'd just as soon not go to the rodeos sneeze   well if you and rachelle go to the fabric stores tonight you'll or this afternoon you'll  have to excuse me i i have some pressing business to attend to   you you you you feel the  same way as he does about them eh   ya ya the t v's gotta got to  be looked at or something  it's been neglected right now   laugh   ya we'll we'll go and look at some fabric stores  that's for sure  ya  you know it's great you know it  rachelle makes wonderful clothing  she sews and everything  knits  what's it called  sews that's it   mhh hmm  ya   see i don't even know the terminology  laugh   but to get me interested in it it'd  like i'd love to learn  i wish i wish i could  did you never take it in school  no  uh uh ours was the last year where boys had to take shop and girls had to take home ec economics and uh   oh but they didn't switch   there was no mix  oh ya   that was the last year  see cos now of course they switch over   uh i think the girls in grade eight take six weeks of  shop and then six weeks of sewing and six weeks of  commercial uhm like uhm computer - related studies   and  so they get a a a little bit of everything to be able to see what they wanna want to  get into  and uh my granddaughter got into the woodworking part of it  she really got off on that and uhm  and she  actually she's won a scholarship to uhm uh the college in edmonton and uhm she'll go there next septem   september   not this september next september  and uhm start uh her courses  in the meantime she's uh uh been offered an apprenticeship ah ah  program and so she'll work for the company f  for before she goes to school and then she'll go and take some of her training and back and forth  wow   so she's looking forward to that  selkirk college at nelson has a really good fine-woodworking program  oh do they   she she she  probably won't be interested since she's since she's   already going somewhere else  but they've got a a one year program  ohh   and the stuff that the students come out with that they show at the end of the year it's it's beautiful  it's incredible isn't it  it's incredible   ya   she made uhm a rocking horse that is just  oh it looks like satin  it is gorgeous  and she's even got eyelashes on it and a mane made with uh rope and  oh it is just the most beautiful thing  every youngster would love to have it  hmm  and uhm they had it on display at the gallery and the lady there said they could have sold it ten times over  easily  and with no problem at all  and of course ashley said no she was keeping that  for her first k kid or for her children   i don't blame her because it's the sort of thing you might never ever make again you know  right   and uh but the grains of the wood and everything are just aww  and she just ha did it in such a way that it flows like  muscle you know  hmm   so like the the back legs  they the flow of the the  grain of the wood  i don't know what kind of wood she's made it out of but uh it is beautiful  so i said well you could let me have it if you want laugh   i remember taking shop the last time in grade eight and i don't know i think my last project was a table or something   you know it was still sticking together a few years later so   oh was it   oh that's more than mine did   but it wa wasn't   it wasn't it wasn't the most beautiful table ever created on the face of the planet that's for sure  laugh first time they let me work on the lathe i think i cough   i started off with ah a nice spindle a nice piece of wood but uh i think it was lots of toothpicks when i was through  laugh   i just could not master that thing at all  not at all   i'm not mechanically inclined laugh   neither am i   should work on something though  gotta got to do something with all this testosterone you know  oh ya i see laugh   words ya  it's a male thing  you wouldn't understand   have you ever heard of male answer syndrome   male answer syndrome is when men even when they know nothing about a subject will go off and spout off on the subject for hours on end whether they really know anything at at all or not  i didn't know that's what it was called but  six or so words   it also includes it also includes men going in the wrong direction forever without stopping to ask directions  that's maybe three words   oh ya don't ask at the gas station    whatever you do  ya   no no   i wouldn't do that   that's not macho   rachelle rachelle  rachelle has to do that  i won't do that   laugh   that's a typical thing with guys is that they won't do that  male answer syndrome  ya   that was in an article  it uh that's the label that this writer gave it    a woman writer of course when she wrote an article about it  laugh   ya well that uh i think uh that's something that i've noticed with guys though  they they never ask directions  they'd sooner get lost than ask directions   laugh   i have gotten lost laugh   so do you have any hobbies at all   cough mhh hobbies  besides the t v i mean  what more is there than the t v i don't know  i uhm i uh  this past year what have i done   not much  i like walking a bit   rachelle and i have tried to set a policy of going for a walk every evening  mhhm   it hasn't worked  it hasn't worked oh laugh   no   i like watching t v  i like reading   when i was a kid i did judo   wasn't very good at it though   it was okay when i got older and i could pick on the little kids you know but laugh   ya boy laugh ya boy   but then i'd have to stick around for the adult class too cos dad was a teacher  so then i'd have to words   oh your dad taught   ya  but now he he curls and he   and he's bought himself a nice big television and a nice big v c r   he curls up laugh   he doesn't lie down either though  no  just like your husband he sits down  ya   that's another thing with guys  they flick   flick the t v cos they can't make up their mind what they  wanna want to watch  well there's so many things to watch though   ya so they watch a bit of this and a  bit bat bit that of that and get nothing out of either one   mhh mhh but you get an impression  and and and and it's the  impression that's important  ya   oh i see  i i wondered about that cos uh i've noticed that women will flick through all the channels and then go back to the one that they've decided on  within a couple of minutes they know what they  gonna going to watch   laugh   but men it's up and down and back and forth  and then they start watching one thing and just when you're getting interested they flip it to something else   laugh
