 and i'm reading the book uhm that one of the books from from the uh stash that i took from your place   pile laugh   i relieved you of a quarter of your bookshelf  laugh   uhm and i can't think of her name cos i don't have a memory  and i can't think of the title of the book  anita brookner   yes  a start in life  ya  how did you know i would start with that one  ah i'm ahhh cheek click   i s i i looked through a couple of them  i started reading them i thought no i'm gonna  going to save that one  this one i'm gonna going to wait  uh uh this one nuh  and then i picked that one up and that one just seemed just right for right now  mhhm  ya  are you liking it  ya  neat eh   ya ya   it's very interesting like characters  huh really   the m mother   her mother is  that character's great  oh ya  oh i really oh i'm glad   i'm glad you picked that one  ya ya  she's written a lot of things too   like if you like that there's other things that'll be   ya i can go and find her elsewhere   ya   absolutely  ya  absolutely  well i'm really i really was onto canadian authors for a long time and so i forgot what else was out there   so i've been kind of you know trying to  broaden my   thing again  ohh   uhh   at least that's a good thing  ya  i mean to like have done the canadian author thing  ah   aye   that's a good thing  ya ya  i don't i i haven't really i mean my whole thing was when ahh when   i left andrew and all of that stuff it was like suddenly   the i all i wanted to do was read women   i i'd never really read women before  like never  maybe you know margaret laurence or something but  mhhm  and then at one point i thought well you know maybe i should broaden my horizons laugh again you know  get out of this whatever   ya   so  ya  ya i i i read trash and i read uhm  you know highbrow stuff and i like it all  i'm not i i   1 like stephen king and i like true crime and   all those kinda kind of things  oh ya   what's true crime   that was you were talking about that the  other day   ya true crime is uhm real murders that have occurred  real unsolved mysteries et cetera you know   right   uhh real people who are actually dead as a result of a crime  but like uh   laugh uhm   ya sorry  serial killer kinda kind of stuff or  serial killers or sorta sort of infamous killers for whatever reason  okay   uhm or people that certainly weren't in the media  that i was aware of be because the crimes happened elsewhere but you know  things that have or or happened in another decade when i wasn't aware of it  okay   but i f there i it's  really interesting the uh how how a writer will tackle the whole thing in terms of uhm where do they position themselves  mhhm   uhm how do they try to create a context for the crime in terms of it's social impli  implications   mhh hmm   uhm if they're good writers they're good writers no matter what they're writing about  and so you know the the portraits that  that ap appear can be  v very like really   riveting  sure   uh is there a level that where they try to explain it  they get into the psychology of the killer  okay  always you have to i mean otherwise it would be three pages long  ya   right   oh ya just the plot  ya   right   right   but uhm uh again women women who commit the murders  i'm sort of very interested in that  always have been   ahhh really  ya  really  ya  so i i always look for new ones that i  haven't haven't read  uh huh  because i read uhm i guess it was the late seventies or the early eighties women who kill   uh that sounds familiar  so an uh american uh writer  anyway she uhm she did this sort of very interesting kind of historical look at uhm lizzie borden and uhm   oh yes okay   cough women i mean   she really re she did incredible research cos she was looking at stuff that you know was in the sort of annals of history but uh documented uh you know obscure cases in massachusetts and like during the eighteenth century or seventeenth century  i know   and uhm these occurrences of men dying in the household and and and no record of   you know why except that they just had you know  a a little   s smell   and and went away  right   laugh   spat   and so you know the whole thing about the arsenic  uh  small doses of arsenic uh on a regular basis  hmm   right   ya   and but she she  selected certain cases studies and they were really interesting because   they most of them weren't sensational  and i think the lizzie borden one was the most familiar   ya that's pretty ya   and uhm you know and   she she begins to draw in all kinds of stuff around uh the his history  and and and everything else and wh   why these women were trying to bump off their husbands at certain points in time  ya   uhm you know and give  give given given the social uhm environment  and okay   so each one somehow represented a historical  moment  and extended from that something   ya   ya ya ya   ya like the jilted lover for example  when women uhm had to be married to have any kind of   of a social standing and were promised marriage and then the guy does whatever  right   oh god yes   he leaves or whatever  right   and she just stalks him and she ends his  life because she is furious because her life has been  destroyed   she has right   right she has no future or any   ya so it it was just very very interesting for all of those other kinds of things  and sort of the social trends of the time and how  eventually in the uhm  ya oh   there was a period of time when   when these sentences were very very light simply because they couldn't believe that a woman had it within her nature to kill  huh   and so they would look at every other conceivable excuse that they could in order to not acknowledge that she was able  to ah you know commit an act of violence  well that's interesting though   right  > and so that so those  </} trends speak so much about so many ot her things in terms of our own justice system and the social mores et cetera et cetera  sure   so it was very interesting  and so once i did that i found i was always picking up   out of the the pot the little  individual cases  interesting   really   and   ya ya  and i i have the really bad ones  like i mean the ones that aren't well- written and have no insight  i i throw them out after i  read them   ya some of them they must be just really   right   but i just chuck them  but but the ones that i found pretty interesting i've hung onto so  ya i've never really   you know i've never really been into like detective stories killing uh but i had for a long time and i probably still do to a certain degree a real thing when i was like mhh twelve to fifteen or so i would read anything about the mafia  oh ya  anything oh my god   that's interesting   but okay so why  what fascinated you about the mafia   i don't know  i ah well i think for one thing  the the just the organization of it  uhhm   like how it  laugh they were so well organized laugh    laugh well no laugh   what a fabulous model for society laugh   laugh   i think that model exists actually  i think it's called the patriarchy   laugh   the head honcho   no but i i was just stunned at how you know i don't know how   how things hung together and  or how people tried to keep things in line  mhhm   and or if it didn't and why not and that sort of   i don't know  i don't know what it was  i mean even now   well i mean it's that whole system of justice within their circles like they have is so  steeped in tradition  oh ya   and it's kinda kind of   the sicilian connection and i mean things that go back to  oh   but i just also just fascinated by the enormity of the networking of crime  mhhm  you know like that's not one person or you know a bunch of people that who get together and go do b and e's break and enters you know  it was like this is a huge vast network of crime  and this laugh fascinated me you know   mhhm   mhhm   and you know it would follow it would  it could cover so much terrritory you know from italy to new york to <[las vegas to you know  mhhm   and and you know it all it all fit in together somehow and i was like  this is   i mean as ah as much as it was scary  laugh i was like this really weird respect  for it laugh   ya   oh ya ya ya   exactly   laugh a really weird respect for it  ya ya  i don't know maybe it's those suits  i don't know laugh   ya i but i remember thinking this is really weird   eddie the weasel don don   i love that  i love the names   laugh   the nicknames  my horoscope this week is about uhm well he talks about how abori a  a aboriginal australian aboriginal  people and are given two names  one is their name that's used within the tribe and one is a sacred name that's never used and is never even told to the child  only the elders know it  hmm  and once you go through some major right of passage then you earn uh the right to know your sacred name and from that  f day forward you can use it   mhhm   okay  and uh so then he says you know we don't have this in our society but i suggest starting a new tradition and that this week you think of and give yourself a name that you will use when you are talking to yourself and no one else will know it   and laugh i love it   this could be dangerous laugh   laugh   i love it   i mean i already do that in a way  like i already have these kind of characters   personas or or whatever that i see myself in for various situations  mhhm mhhm   but but ya   so have you been thinking  sure  ya  i'm not telling you though laugh   oh no no i wouldn't ask  of course not   but it's fun because you can think of like you know sort of different aspects of yourself and whether a name for that aspect is going to be enough to be your sacred name  mhh hmm   like is it going to cover enough of your  that could drive you crazy  it's going to be great   it's going to be great   laugh   i figure i have a week to fig  figure it out because then you know my horoscope comes up next week laugh   laugh word you're getting in trouble word   laugh then i have to think up something else  laugh word laugh     the exercise for this week p  pick a sacred name  okay   ya pick a sacred name   put on your to-do list  laugh exactly  the to-do list  laugh that's laugh exactly laugh   put it up on the bulletin board  have you thought of your sacred name yet laugh   laugh only two more days   that's right  i think i actually already have one  i think i already have it cos i sort of  it's interesting i was reading i got  the fiction issue of new yorker and in it they have this year they've decided to include journals of different writers  hmm  so i think it's sort of fun  well ya  and one of the people a a  writer i'm not familiar with talked about how he came to writing or began to really kind of expand his notion of writing
