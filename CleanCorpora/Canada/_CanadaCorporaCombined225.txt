 okay i've come today to speak to you essentially about tesl and  the community and job opportunities in the greater montreal area   uh i'd like to begin by discussing my personal experience in  tesl a little bit   uh i began i guess considering teaching as an option in my life  about three and a half years ago   i was in a dead end job uh with an incomplete b a in english literature   uh i had a family which had just began  my daughter was uh just a month old or so   and i was investigating the possibilities of becoming a teacher  i had heard of the concordia program i had i had some counselling uh career orientation counselling  and i had pretty much fixed my idea on becoming a teacher   except of course i had a family and a job and it's sometimes difficult to laugh starts separate yourself laugh ends from  that stable income to uh launch yourself into another career   well i guess destiny kind of helped me along because  it was the beginning of a major recession and uh being the last in i  quickly became the first out laugh starts   so laugh ends i found myself on unemployment  uh no b a nothing and i decided to join concordia and the tesl department   the way in wasn't that easy   uh it's a very difficult program to get into  they have very high expectations for you and uh they have very high demands about your qualities coming into the program   uh i ended up in the philosophy program here   and i still have a year to do to get a b a in philosophy at concordia but uh  i after one session there proving myself to be an exceptional student i was accepted into the tesl program   uhm i'd like to talk about tesl in in in  uh terms of pre while and post  and those who are in tesl will understand the uh  the joke with that  uhm i've already described my pre-tesl life and uh now i'd like to describe the while in the program   tsk and i think essentially uh tesl is a   prepar preparation for both a profession  and a vocation  uh teaching is a mix of both science and art   uh you have to be you have to be prepared to be uh artistic in the design of activities and the way you implement material  but you also have to be a scientist in the sense that you must observe group behaviour you must observe individual behaviour  and you must uh de you must  uhm tsk evaluate individuals and you must do this objectively  so there's a very scientific aspect to teaching   uh i think the tesl program provides you with i call the five ps  uh it has a program that is bo uh that is very balanced between learning theory language learning and linguistics   uhm and it's getting better  next year there's a new four year program being implemented  which will augment the number of practice hours and i imagine also methodology and the courses will be expanded   uh i think the second p for tesl is people   the people at uh two levels  the staff and the students  the staff uh in the tesl department are leaders in their fields  and they are leaders in the research of language learning and language teaching   the people who teach in tesl are quality teachers and uh who  sincerely care and are concerend about your future   uhm the students are heterogeneous in the sense that we have students from all over the world uh with many different experiences and varied backgrounds   and uh they're all very interesting and intelligent people to work with   uh tesl program also gives you the practice you need uh to become a teacher   uh it's not an easy profession and tesl itself applies to many different levels and we get that experience  we teach adults   we teach at the secondary level and we teach at the primary level  uh we had in my time a hundred and fifty hours of practice teaching and this will be soon seven hundred hours with the new program which uh i think is adequate  uh w i think a hundred and fifty hours was just a drop in the bucket in terms of tesl experience  and uh you have the chance to practice creating materials  creating lessons being a creative teacher   there's also a lot of progress you witness in tesl you progress personally and uh professionally   and finally i think tesl gives you a perspective on teaching  the role of the teacher   the role of the student   and on language learning   and all this comes out to opportunity  and there is a lot of opportunity in quebec for tesl people   uh there's private schools for both adults and young people camps  things like that   the cegep programs are expanding  uh which in turn means the secondary school programs are expanding  uh there's even work in publishing and sales in quebec  there's a lot of publishing of uh english language learning materials here   uh in the public system and the school commissions there's the primary level we are uh trained to teach at both primary and secondary and we are given a certificate in which we can teach at both primary and secondary   and there's a lot of adult teaching as well in uh the school commissions  i think that uh clears throat there's going to be even an expansion at that level with   with the effects of the last election i think english will only become more important to the people of quebec   uhm how do you get a job though once you come out of a program  you come out of a program you've been provided with a certain number of skills and techniques about teaching   you're provided with a certain amount of theory about teaching  but that doesn't help you get a job   laugh and uh that's i guess the big uh obstacle once you finish your program   uhm tsk i think though that tesl also provides you an opportunity to network yourself   when you're doing practice teaching sessions you get to know the people at the school   you try to contact uh these people afterwards about supply teaching  uhm you have to send out c vs and a lot of them  it costs laugh starts money  it costs a few hundred dollars laugh ends but you send  good quality c vs in french with letters of reference from professors and uh  uh cooperating teachers   letters of attestation of your uh sch   of your uh education   it takes time before you get your b ed  it takes time before you get your certificate or your permit from the ministry of education   get the documents from concordia  they can provide you with certain documents that will help you get a job   and provide a good cover letter in french  you're dealing with a french school commission  you have to demonstrate a certain ability to communicate in french  if you're weak get somebody laugh t   to translate a letter for you   get that first step in the door  they think you can speak french   good that's the first step   uh you'll end up going through interview processes where uh five people are interviewing you uh   school principals  the heads of school commissions  the heads of uh the human resources department   are all flinging questions at you in both english and french for about thirty minutes of time   you have to be able to switch languages quickly and efficiently  and finally if you get through all that you may even have to take a french exam   and uh that's another thing you should prepare yourself for   uh you should prepare yourself for in advance  uh the french demands vary   i know that if you want to teach in montreal with the uh catholic school board here   uh your french better be as good as as a native speaker  other school boards have special tests for the english teachers which have been reduced in uh expectations  uhm i was very lucky  uh since i left concordia i've had many job opportunities many job offers   uhm i went through three interview processes  i was selected in two of them   one of them was uh a little far from montreal in uh a small town called bellingham near gaul where they asked me to teach primary in grades four five and six in three different schools  as a specialist at the primary level you're often teaching in more than one school   uhm i had clears throat verbally accepted the job but no contract was signed fortunately because shortly thereafter i had another interview and i was selected to teach uh secondary school here  close to montreal in repentigny   and presently i'm working in uh l'&eacute;cole secondaire  jean-d-aulps   uh it's a big school   it's uh   although the uh principal said we're not allowed to use those words about our school laugh   it's not big  it's not large   it only has two thousand six hundred students   uh in the second cycle of secondary  so we're talking about secondary three four and five only   uh we have twelve hundred students in secondary three  five hundred and fifty in secondary four   four hundred and fifty in secondary five and   four hundred students uh following individual uh educational programs   uh you can see then the school itself is a community   the size of our schools in quebec especially at the secondary level uh it's not uncommon to find schools of at least two thousand students   uhm and this is a whole socia social  network a whole community in itself   in my school m in my school  the staff itself 's is two hundred people  we have a hundred and sixty teachers   we have five vice principals  we have two psychologists   and at least another fifty professionals and support staff   as a teacher you teach probably four five six different groups  so you're dealing with a hundred and eighty individuals on a daily basis   i can't say that i've had a great deal of experience  teaching i've only maybe taught in a high school for ten weeks of time  but it's amazing what you see in those ten weeks   uh i've seen both positive things and negative things  and i use that word carefully   uhm on the negative side i've been through bomb scares  riots stories of suicide drugs and alcohol pregnancy  incest psychological abuse and just general disrespect for adults and authority  on the other side on the positive side when you work in a school of this size you really feel that there is a sense of community  this is a community in itself  there's also a sense of care that all the staff members  have for the students and for their success  we all desire the same thing that our students succeed   uh there's team work spirit idealism again on the part of the staff but also on the st part of the students   there's a tendency in teaching to focus in on the three students in the back who are creating the problems in your classroom but don't forget about the other twenty-five who are there for a reason and who want to learn   there's also the one-on-one relationships you have with  students   uh their vision is sometimes naive  but it's very heart-warming sometimes to see that naivety and that idealism   uh and just the contact you have with students  i walk down the hallway near the cafeteria at lunch and i'm greeted fifteen times in the space of five minutes   and that's a good feeling as a person  it uh it it gives you it validates your   experience in the school   so i don't want to let the negative sides over   overcome the positive side  but when you're dealing with such a large number of people you're dealing with a real cross-section of society and those things that you see on the news once a week or twice a week uh become real to you  uh they take a face they take a name
