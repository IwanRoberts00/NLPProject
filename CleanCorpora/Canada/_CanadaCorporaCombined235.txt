 so it's worth doing kay okay   and so like loud laughter from audience you want this one  kay okay   so this here is the fixy thing laughter from audience kay okay and for  the registration test which tests how the film is sitting against the gate kay okay and that the pressure  plates   make sure that its flap   this in my opinion is a really bad example of a registration  chart kay okay   this is my example kay okay which is one line across one line down with a screw right here next to the centre cross  i find it's too many lines and it's too confusing kay  okay   now the idea behind this is you do this test first before doing any of the other tests  what you do is you set up your camera so that it frames  and it doesn't matter what lens you use kay okay   so that it frames this entire chart kay   okay   then you roll fifty feet worth of film kay  okay   and you have to remember that you have to superimpose an image  comments   no but for a hundred and fifty dollars in an hour and a half's work you can go into a black bag and do it in two minutes   really fast  some cameras go in reverse  the cameras that do go in reverse there's a little trick  i'll show you afterwards kay okay   what you do is you try to get this lid for f four then film it at two point eight   the trick is not to put the cross in your viewfinder on this point it's to put it on the dot right after right next   to it  so you're lining up centre frame here okay   and you film for fifty feet  then you go into the black bag and rewind fifty feet of film back  you turn the chart over and you reframe on where the dot is moved to  or the screw usually is what's done kay okay   and shoot another fifty feet and what you get is a superimposition of two sets of lines like this  and this is why i like this better cos there's too many lines  so we'll look at this one  so what you end up with is a superimposition with the xs overlapping at two sets of lines running parallel to each other  what happens then is you watch it  if the lines move in and out of focus or if one line's moving in and out of focus and the other one isn't or if the lines are moving side by side   any kind of pulsation in these lines there's something wrong with the pressure part cos the film isn't sitting flat against the gate  and at that point you go to whatever lab technician if it's the university or if it's panavision or moliflex or michel trudel and you say this camera's no good i'd like to change  kay okay now the only problem is  this test is fine for these cameras like this but the newer cameras  are like the aton the arri s r one two and three the eclair or the arri thirty-five b l which does not look anything like that  it's the same kinda kind of magazines as the s r or the aton and the eclair which is side by side  there the pressure plate is in the magazine which means you have to test each magazine   and you have to do this test for each magazine  but the easier part is there you just open up the magazine in a dark room and rewind the film and then close it again  here you have to open it up you have to unload it   there's a lot more work on these ones  but you only have to do it once   there you have to do it three four five times  and that's how you tell the pressure plate kay  okay   it's a simple test generally done first because you have to rewind  if you have a camera like the arri s which is the small one there which can run in reverse if you have the right motor which i don't have the right motor with us right now  what you can do is you set your mark your counter  at zero you open up the front of the lens take the lens off and you have the gate  in the gate you make an x on the film in the coloured pen  run fifty feet  at the next   where you stop at fifty feet you take the gate off  the lens off again  you make another x  all you gotta have got to do is put the lens on rewind  when you someone walking loudly past microphone get to fifty feet loud door opening and closing you then look for your x by moving it frame by frame  asks a question   in sixteen millimetre  comments   if you're going in reverse  comments   you're going in reverse  comments   with the lens cap on the lens  comments   when you your counter counts back down to about one foot from fifty  comments   then roll and all you're doing is rolling your twenty-four frames which is one foot  comments   till you find your x  asks a question   kay okay what it is is in the gateway the film will look like this   in the gate that's one frame  comments   right  you take a pen and you draw an x  comments   kay okay so what you'll have is an image like this at two points on your film  asks a question   why  because if you've got rewind on your camera you don't have to go into the dark room  you just have to find where fifty feet was  comments   so you rewind by watching the counter go back fifty feet  comments   and stop and look for that x and you just get that x again the starting x  you put the camera in forward  you turn your chart around  comments   and then you just run to fifty feet  and that way you're not wasting film right  cos generally when they do a camera test they give you a short  end of about i dunno don't know eighty ninety feet  and you have to do the whole test on that because they're not   gonna going to give you four hundred feet of film  comments   cos it just costs too much money  they'll just give you old film stock  comments   loud noise starts is that clear  comments   no it's not a problem but it's the fastest way to do it to make sure you're at the right place loud noise ends   comments   kay okay   asks a question   that you can get old film stock for your camera tests  comments   from the last shoot you just did  comments   no the lab won't give it to you but i have cans of old film stock in my trunk from productions i've done before kay  okay   when i go out to a new production i say okay well it's included in my price  and i increase my price for the camera test to include my film stock kay okay   they like it because they don't have to find a short end they have all this brand new film for a feature  and i just go well then i'm gonna going to   do it and in that case twenty dollars whatever  and your camera assistant gets all the short ends   at the end of the production you stack 'em them  up if you need to use 'em them use   'em them   but generally everything under fifty feet is thrown out   if it's in thirty-five then everything under twenty-five gets thrown out of sixteen if it's just there and they're changing  knives   or they'll just run out eh  they'll just run it out of the camera  or throw it out or use it for scratch tests eh  it's scrap   and so this is it's to check your uh ground glass  kay okay   these lines have been put on by someone else  what you do is again you set up your camera with a lens  and you just frame for a chart this size  and there's no lines on it  pretend these aren't here kay okay   and once you have a frame what you do is depending on the aspect ratio you're shooting in whether it's sixteen super sixteen thirty-five there's a piece of glass in the viewpiece that sets up the t v frame and the frame you're filming in the film and that x that you use for the   word test kay okay   so what happens is you've gotta got to  make sure that what you're looking through is the same thing that the gate and the lens are seeing  so this basically forms a game of like running back and forth  but you set up the camera you frame and you look and you find all the lines that mark the t v frame the sixteen frame and the x  and with a piece of tape you run and you l   put it across and you have to go back and make sure that you're right on the line  and once you're on the line then you do the bottom and you keep going back and forth laughter in audience   size  and could be 'then' you do the little x   and once that's done again you write the name of the production company you're working for all the information the name of the film and you film it  now you have to write the lens that you're using and the distance from the lens you're at as well as the camera   once you film that what happens is this   if you see the entire frame on film when you get the camera test back everything's good   if you see half the frame you've got a big problem  if it cuts off any part of the frame it's not calibrated correctly   now what you can do then is either through mathematics and  figs figures like figure out what the shift to right and left or up and down is and then compensate on set or you go to them and say fix it  asks a question   the well here yeah they'll do it and if you're paying thousands of dollars a day they will do it  laughter in audience right  so that's the test  now by knowing this you can get work doing camera tests for people   and make decent money very fast  comments   so so but they don't teach you that here other than me so that's why you know it kay  okay   so once you've done your camera tests we'll move on to the cameras which is the arri s and the b l sixteen mil  millimetre   now these two cameras the b ls are not used anymore   but the arri s is used frequently  the b l is too noisy too heavy and the magazine is just  sigh inconvenient for anything from loading to making scratch tests when watching checking your film  when you're starting your magazine  the arri s is used as a second unit camera because one it's indestructible two it's got a variable speed motor and a twenty-four frame motor  not quartz but it locks at twenty-four frames  and i've done lots of films where we've done two words  like rock videos with this camera and it's been dead on  so it's it works exact it's a   very noisy camera it has absolutely no insulation but it's the exact same mechanism  asks a question   with this motor it runs at twenty-four frames  you can't use  your sound person will have a very hard time trying to get any sound if this is in the room  asks a question   yeah no problem  comments   not a problem  you can do your entire film post like italian style with this camera  comments   i've done rock videos where we've had a c d which is exact time  in playback with this camera and once it's synched up it matches word for word the set  occasionally we'll lose a frame here and there  almost all cameras do   but when you're shooting three to one four to one ratio  at least you're gonna going to have coverage that is gonna going to be in synch at all times right  so it's not a problem  asks a question   which lights  all of them  asks a question   the closest ones  cough that's fine sound of a loud door closing   that's why this is a good camera to know right  and as well this camera only works with bayonet-mount style lenses while this one works with both bayonet and c-mount  which means that you have more flexibility  and what makes it a great camera is that you can be on set you can come with a zoom lens it's a c-mount and be second unit
