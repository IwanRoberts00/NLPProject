sun comes out the temperatures will start to bound upwards  we're expecting a high of maybe as high as  uhh minus two for midtown montreal   recording cut out d and  so the canadiens montreal hockey team won when they made a change  they do that very well it seems  four two over the stanley cup champion new jersey devils  vincent damphousse makes a good case for becoming captain of the canadiens  it's not really uhh hotly contested that he will become captain  he had a couple of goals last night  and pat jablonsky who may not be relegated to being strictly a backup now that jocelyn thibault is in town played very well last night and was the game's first star in backstopping the canadiens to the win in the first game post patrick roy  but uh the team really now is probably going to focus a lot on jocelyn thibault  he was from montreal  he's only twenty years old  and the pressure is enormous to fill the shoes of patrick roy  speech by jocelyn thibault   so much has been written about this whole situation what happened with patrick roy but the question still remains what really did happen  we'll allow the principals involved to explain this  ah we have an exclusive tape  there was actually a microphone in the canadiens dressing room saturday night after the game when patrick roy met with mario tremblay rejean houle and president ronald corey cat and dog sounds set to music  so that's part of that conversation laughing and discussion with co-host   they have made a mistake and ronald corey is gonna  going to eventually pay for this because he had to back his management who was only there for six weeks that  he put in six weeks ago more discussion with co-host   uh elsewhere just a note from the olympics  the uh opening ceremonies in atlanta next year will not have the
