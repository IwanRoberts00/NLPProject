 ya it's where the uh the faucet is coming out now its been all boarded up and stuff  mhhm   yup  mhh  hhm so how are your plans for the garage coming along  well well we have lots of estimates lots and lots of estimates  i see  alton is uh really he wants to be very sure about what we're doing  okay   ya  so i have been the go you know   anson's been doing my negotiating for me actuallyx   ya   he's been he's the one you know cos we decided that all three of us would get one quote for the brick and one quote for the garage  okay  and so uh so i got my one and  alton had seventy-six laugh   you know i'm slightly exagerating a little bit  but > he's you know he's just </}  every other day he's phoning me up there for a while  saying i've got somebody coming tomorrow at ten o'clock let them in and   et cetera et cetera   laugh   so actually of the ones that he calls there's maybe about a thrid of them really shows up  laugh   okay  so he probably has about three or four  alright  and leona has two i think  okay  one f for  i think she has one for the bricks and one for the garage   but i think that's what she has  ya  so we have a consensus about how the garage roof needs to be fixed  uhhm still some disagreement about why the leak is actually there in the first place  words figure i started you know   the roof started deteriorate   juan and and ah people   that you know that he that   that we've talked to with name  agreed that it is becuase of the staircase  i see  words sitting and that it's sort of forcing the roof to fold up you know because of the pressure  okay   i see  and uhm leona and alton the people that are coming in and talking to them seem to think it's because the roofing  was not done on leona's landing there   you know those uhm she's got a little balconey  and they didn't roof and then put the balconey on  ya   they the balconey if you still remember its just sort of roofed up to the beginning of the balconey  oh i see  so the underneath the balconey up to the to the wall  there's no roofing there  ya   okay  and uhm it started leaking and then it caused the uhm the uh flashing in the roof to lift up for some reason  ya   that's you know i'm i'm   not quite sure  ya though if if it caused  if it is leaking and the beams started to warp or something it could uh cause that kind of problem  ya there's one beam there that is not doing anything at all  it's it' just you know it's just you know words a six year old's tooth  in the fence   words   uhhu   uhhu   x its just / - > its very wobbly laugh   ya   if you take a stick and it'd go ploop whaah   laugh   but uh we do have a consensus but uh you know about how to fix it   so its not the quote that i got  from the carpenter now he's going to do the ro   roof i mean he gave the quote for the roof and then he was going to do the carpentry on the roof so his quote was three hundred and fifty dollars  oh that's not that bad actually   word no its not bad at all  good  yawn so uh and then  his quote f for to do  the roof is seventeen hundred and fifty dollars  ya  and leona's quote is three thousand dollars  whoa  big difference  yes it is  ya  and we've got did i tell you the quotes  that we got to do the brick in the front and the back the difference the disparity between  no  alton brought somebody who looked at the front  and it needs to be done because the mortar is coming away and there's big  gaps and cracks and  stuff and it could i mean it could end up being a really expensive job taking that all down  right   ya   so uhm alton got somebody who came and quoted six thousand dollars   so what did your uh what did your uhm   fortune-teller tell you  uhhhm she told me that after ah after  we move out together that uh laugh words  oh ya  words, maybe repeats last unclear statement  huh  yup within the next year  well as long as she does the reading list  there's no problem laugh   laugh smart ass  ya i'm looking forward to getting in there  urgh so what are we going to get today  uhh gotta get uh that that  bathmat that we've been talking about  mhhm  uhhm i don't know if we see anything else  you know if you see anything else i'll i'll   take about fifty dollars out of the bank or something and uh and  and if you see anyhting else that  that you think we should get then i'll get it  'kay well all we need is really a bath mat  i've got

out today  yup  uhh i'll show you that carpet at ahh   at ah at ah zellers two words  the store   ya  you know what today was an incredible day  this afternoon for some reason i felt uhh i felt like

out of there because uhm it it wasn't more stressful than other days it wasn't particularly you know stressful compared to  other other days of the week but for some reason i was anticipating the long weekend word  anticipate the long weekend it's like puff you just want to leave laugh   mhhm phone starts ringing and continues over conversation   and ahh uhm will you get that  no  no  so anyway i just g i just wanted to uh  i just wanted to leave i was i was really anxious to leave   so then i storm out of the place answering machine prompt plays loudly in backgorund followed by a message being left   uhm i've got my paycheck  uhm excuse me i'm competing with the answering machine here  uhh the i get to the bank   and uh then i couldn't believe that you know   you know the our of

and why should this thing be flashing  mhhm   ya   both machines were flashing  murphy's law  ya  so anyway there's this guy waiting you know for it to stop flashing  evidently he thought he he   thought if you waited long enough they stopped flashing  i i didn't have the patience to wait  so i just puff laugh i just  underneath my breath i just sort of swore at it and i said to hell with this you know and and uh i left  laugh phone rings again    words   they usually get fixed in uhm they normally get fixed in under five minutes don't they   ya but usually when they have  when the out of out of orders icon's flashing  it means that uh it means that uhm uhh   that they're changing they they're   putting more money into the machines phone stops ringing   you know that they choose if they're doing that  if that's the case then their choosing an ach   you know a fine time at four o'clock in the afternoon  when everyone's getting out of work early on a thursday for the long weekend they need money  but anyway i'm not complaining  laugh   that's the story there  well   and uhh   so i talked to my mom today  ya  she's cleanning out my my father's cleaning out the buffet said in
