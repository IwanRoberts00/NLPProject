 i think madam speaker it's important to note that the second phase will be a thorough review by a parliamentary committee and by a federal-provincial task force on the whole youth justice system and that there will be considerable public input in that review process as there was and as there has been so far to this point  obviously it's very important to involve provincial legislatures  and provincial justice officials because the legal system obviously is administered at both the federal and provincial levels   this bill offers some very badly needed improvements  the original young offenders act had an excellent rationale in my view  it was simply to recognize the fact that society in canada as a nation we ought to deal with the young offender in a way different from a more mature offender that the penalties ought to be different  that the where incarceration is required that there ought to be different facilities  and i think that canadians generally recognize that and accepted that rationale   unfortunately i think as we know on all sides of the house and as canadians from coast to coast to coast know the young offenders act has in at least a minority of cases been somewhat badly abused  there's not much question in my mind madam speaker when you see young offenders on national television in this country telling canadians that they consider the uh young offenders act as some  something of a joke and that they feel that uh the   when they're incarcerated that it's kind of like going to camp  and you hear that on national t v from young offenders repeat young offenders then it's no ques question   there's no doubt in my mind that canadians feel and rightly so that there are some problems with the current legislation  and that obviously is is why the minister the honourable minister is seeking uh to put forth these improvements as step one of the ultimate act that we will have in place in this country   if i might uh briefly consider the improvements that  that are offered in the uh proposed legislation  i think one of the major improvements is the provision that would put the onus on a sixteen or seventeen year old offender  convicted of a violent crime obviously especially murder the the   the onus will now be on that individual to convince the court why he or she should not be dealt with as an adult criminal in adult court and subject to the tougher penalties of law  that's an important change because obviously under the previous legislation or the current legislation that we seek to amend the reverse is true  a sixteen or seventeen year old convicted even of murder is dealt with on a much more lenient basis and is not tried in adult court  and this legislation will correct what i think most canadians consider to be a a gross inequity in that area  the the provision for murder or the penalty for murder madam speaker i would just recall for honourable members  that and for canadians generally that it started out at a mere three years for first degree murder  and in the area of my riding of london-middlesex we had a  we've had a a sad situation a few years ago where one young offender murdered i believe it was three people it was certainly more than one person and yet subject to a maximum total penalty of three years  that was clearly not just and is clearly not adequate for a serious crime like murder  and so the the penalty went from three years within the the last short period of time to five years but this legislation would uh would   allow a maximum penalty a doubling of that maximum penalty up to ten years  now some might still say that for for mur   murder for first degree murder ten years is inadequate and i suppose that's a debatable point but it's certainly far more just and f than the five-year  penalty that uh that it will prov that it  will replace   the under sixteen and seventeen year old offenders in  uh in that age category will will   not be eligible for parole as early if convicted of murder  in other words a young offender convicted of murder will now find it much more difficult to earn parole than he or she has under the current legislation  and again i think that that's that's  just common sense and and simple justice  so as i say madam speaker canadians know that there have been problems with the with the young offenders act and  they are they're crying out for improvements and i think the minister has offered major improvements as the first step of a two-step process  as our red book liberal party platform said during the uh election campaign and as the minister and the prime minister have continued to say and and members on uh this side of the house have continued to say since the uh election of october past that public safety must be the top priority as we address this issue  now let me be completely fair and say that i've heard that statement from all parts of the house and i agree with that that public safety must be the first consideration when we're considering the justice system in any part of the justice system and that includes the young offenders uh the uh those those offenders who are young canadians   as as its first priority   however where perhaps i differ as a liberal from some honourable members in the house is this  this party and this minister and this legislation seeks to find a balanced approach to this serious problem of youth crime  it's not enough to take to simply say  let's throw them in jail for as long as we would any other adult throw away the key and and uh let them rot in jail  that's not uh the answer  and we haven't heard that attitude too much in the house but   i'm i'm displeased to say that i have detected that that is uh kind of the approach of certain honourable members  and i would find it short-sighted because it's not a balanced approach   legislation alone will not solve this problem  it's certainly a key component of addressing this issue but it's not enough in and of itself  i think that we're very short-sighted as a nation if we don't seek to treat the root causes of youth crime the poverty that many if not most young offenders experience the very real poverty that most canadians don't experience a high percentage of young offenders have experienced in their lifetime the repeated family violence that they have experienced themselves often the victims of this violence both sexual and non-sexual violence   racism is unfortunately a real problem unfortunately and young offenders who are from a minority group when you analyse their background and analyze why they committed crime racism is a repeated theme in   in those particular uh young offenders from minority groups  the whole question of illiteracy and dropping out of school  i can tell you madam speaker as an educator for twenty-one years that the first sign that you may have a potential young offender on your hands teachers will tell you they uh those first symptoms if you will are exhibited in classrooms at the youngest ages at the lowest grades   and of course obviously as with criminals of all ages substance abuse by young offenders is a major factor uh in why that they are involved in criminal activity  madam speaker if one were to uh summarize these root causes   in in a brief phrase i think we could do no better than describe the dysfunctional family or the breakdown in the family and in good family values in this country in a mi i hope a minority of families  but an analysis of young offenders will show that a high percentage of them an overwhelming percentage of them come from dysfunctional families where there is not proper parental supervision where there is not proper parental inculcation of values with these young people  and so in effect if you will as a society we reap what we sow  and this party seeks to find a balanced approach so i applaud the minister and the legislation but i applaud the fact that he says time and again when he speaks to the house that we have to treat the root causes of crime otherwise we are not ultimately going to come up with an improvement in this important area  sure we will lock away young offenders for a longer time at great cost to the nation but that will not solve the problem which we ultimately hope to improve upon  and so madam speaker what we ought to do as a country and what the legislation seeks to do in my view is to while  improving the the legislation and coming up with more realistic penalties it seeks to not only uh be reactive to young offenders but it seeks to be to to uh put preventive action into place  and the sharing of information among professionals uh police officials school authorities that will be an important part of preventive action  i say as a teacher that uh that you know any teacher in this country knows there are young offenders in some cases violent young offenders walking around the halls of that particular school  and it's important that educators know that in the interests of the safety of the other students in that facility and of indeed staff in that school because it's a fact that there has been an increase in violent uh crime in schools in this country and it concerns all of us  and so madam speaker i uh i'm  pleased to join in the debate today and as i say i applaud the minister for the legislation  it's a major first step in the right direction and we will await as all canadians do the ultimate improvements in the young offenders act  thank you very much applause   it being six oh five p m the house will now proceed to the consideration of private members' business as listed on today's order paper  mister bachand     word   oops sorry     short french statement   short french statement and introduction   french, long statement, at least 10 minutes  applause   the honourable parliamentary secretary to the leader of the government in the house of commons  french, 50 seconds   however i'd like to uh uhm stress that a reliable and affordable a reliable and affordable food distribution system is critical to the health and well-being of tens of thousands of canadians living in northern isolated communities  and so this issue is one that uhh must concern us as a national legislature in in canada  here in the south the issue of food distribution is not as significant for one or either uh of governments or residents  nutritious food is broadly available at supermarkets or corner stores throughout the areas in southern canada and distribution of food products is left in the hands of the private sector with no demand for or need for government involvement  however in the north the situation as the honourable member has indicated is dramatically different  many communities are isolated and do not have year round surface access so food supplies must be delivered in some cases by air  in other cases uh by sea and perishable foods which as a rule are the most nutritious are are very difficult to arrange for in some of these communities   the expense of transporting perishable foods to remote communities increases their cost to consumers  the honourable member provided the house with a list uh the variety of which i've seen in my northern experiences i must say  uh these areas are not only isolated but they're often economically depressed  in some communities unemployment is as high as eighty-five per cent uh and so many families are living on social assistance supplemented by   whatever community uh whatever commodities they can harvest from the land   uh northern food the northern food mail program therefore is vitally important madam speaker
