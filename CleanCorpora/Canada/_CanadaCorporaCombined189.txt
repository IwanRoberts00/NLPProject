 as you can tell from our replays they're showing a lot of jumps and that's what these men do better than anybody else has ever done before  here's the triple flip preceded by the footwork  nicely pulled out   well there are some great skaters here but  but they say petrenko and browning their jumps really set them apart from the rest  yeah   well the thing to notice is how much flow they have coming in coming out  here are the marks technical marks five eights a five seven from the yugoslavian up to a five nine from the american judge  it will be very interesting to see how they're seeded after this original program  now the artistic marks five eights across the board the hungarian judge a five nine  not enough though and just like in halifax kurt browning  is second in the original program and viktor petrenko of the soviet union will lead after the original   we've seen the soviet champion and the canadian champion  here's the american champion todd eldredge and he could be a wild card in this because   yes chris   todd is a technically strong skater but he sometimes lacks the aggression to really put the program over   had a problem on the landing of the triple axel   it was performed but he did touch down with his hand   very nice triple s jump   he's carried excellent speed through this pair   this combination spin   like petrenko and browning i like the way todd goes out there and interprets his music  he knows his music he's got a a  movement for throughout there's never a dull moment never a stray arm and that's important when you're  gonna going to get into this league of competition  i thought except for the touchdown on the triple axel it was a very strong performance and i think that he will be up  should be up in the top  almost a sense of relief on his face when he was finished  i think uhm his shorts have given some trouble before and  if to get this under his belt has got to be a real confidence booster  here's a look at the triple axel and a little low on the landing but laugh   that hand actually didn't touch down but came within inches of it  nineteen years of age from south chatham massachusetts the two-time american champion  the city was especially proud of his second championship because christopher bowman was there and he still prevailed   he was fifth in halifax and here are the marks for todd eldredge  the first set   five fours five fives five sixes and a five seven from the hungarian judge   and the artistic marks five eight from the german judge five eight from the hungarian judge  those though are third place marks for todd eldridge of the united states  now let's go down to brian williams with kurt browning  interview with browning   welcome back to the olympiahalle in munich  what a group we have seen browning eldredge bowman to come and right in the middle of it is elvis stojko the youngster who will turn nineteen next week from richmond hill and the mariposa club in barrie  as elvis skates i want you to take note of his knees in the landing of his jumps  there are dancers here who would just kill to have knees like elvis stojko   beautiful triple lutz   that was a nice start for elvis   he's preparing now for his combination which will be a triple axel double toe   an unfortunate miss for elvis but i think he's young  he's only at his beginning of his career and i think with some experience under his belt those kind of things are gonna   going to come to him naturally   what i've noticed about elvis this this  year is that he's really improved on his artistry   artistry   he's really worked hard at it and now he's got the jumps and he's also got the package to go with it   aside from the difficulty in the jump combination i thought for elvis it was an excellent outing   he appeared confident covered good ice and finished strongly  i thought all the other jumps he performed were very solid the program was solid and unfortunately there will be a deduction for the triple axel and it'll probably be in the area of about a point five deduction so that'll hurt him a little bit   here's a look at that triple axel   he gets great height   but it unfortunately looked like he just didn't prepare to break out of it soon enough   he looked  yes   he looked over-rotated to me   here's a look at the double axel that he finished with and that was very good and solid and look at those bent knees  now his breakthrough was last year in halifax when he was ninth after being eighth the same year at the world juniors but he seems to relish the role of learning from kurt browning pushing kurt browning and he certainly is the future of canadian skating  well there's nothing to make you want to work harder than  you w when you got someone in your own backyard who's the world champion and it's a real target to shoot for  he's taken the positive approach  viacheslav zagorodniuk of the soviet union who had trouble today  has been criticized for relaxing being number two behind viktor petrenko  now the marks for elvis stojko and the technical marks are low because of the problem  yes i think we see those marks reflect the missed element  and that's what the short program is all about  there is no room for error  well the artistic marks should be much better and here they come and they are much better   up to a five five from the hungarian judge who ranks elvis fourth  overall he will be in fifth place elvis stojko of canada   christopher bowman of the united states is warming up  he's next when we return to munich and more of the nineteen ninety-one world figure skating championships tv advertisements   the most controversial perhaps the most talked about skater here is christopher bowman of the united states  born in hollywood and i guess his story is potentially a  hollywood script  well chris the controversy has come about because of his move to training under a fellow canadian toller cranston and we're  gonna going to see a really distinct and different christopher bowman out here today  he looked a little bit unsure of himself on the warm-up prior  to to his skate but christopher always seems to be one that can pull it off when it counts   let's see   that was a gorgeous triple lutz jump with a triple toe  it doesn't quite have the difficulty of the combinations that kurt and viktor performed but it was well done   and a very nice triple flip   he's on today   well for christopher i thought it was an excellent excellent performance  he went out there and really moved that program out  that's something he hasn't always done with consistency but he covered a lot of ice especially in his footwork sections and completed every element required to a tee  well it hasn't been easy for toller cranston to make him a more focused athlete but boy the discipline showed today  you could really see the little toller touches throughout the program   it sure is a different christopher then we saw last year at worlds [ 48:30]  well i mentioned the hollywood script because erratic is the best way to describe his career  l last summer at the goodwill games he improvised his whole program and said he skated like a total fool  laugh   here's a look at his triple lutz   very clean   into the triple toe loop   very nice   the one thing with christopher is he doesn't quite have the speed  going into the jumps that viktor and kurt seem to have   here's a look at the triple flip   very nice landing  he gave a performance that made you sit back and go that's the kind of thing that christopher bowman has the potential to do at all times but we haven't always seen it  he was a childhood actor and he has certainly  thickened the plot here at the world championships with the original program   and here are the first set of marks for christopher bowman  up to a five eight   now the marks are are   a little lower than viktor's and kurt's and that's because he performed a combination that was less difficult than they did  he chose to do the triple lutz instead of the triple axel combination  we see him sitting there with ellen burka who is also a reknowned canadian coach  now the artistic marks and they too are impressive  he'll move ahead of his american counterpart todd eldredge and he'll be right behind viktor petrenko of the soviet union and kurt browning of canada  christopher bowman of the united states is third   the last of thirty-four skaters petr barna the czechoslovakian champion and he is a legitimate threat here  chris i h had the opportunity to see him skate from the european championships and i understand he was coming off of an injury then and he looked great then and with the additional time to work on that injury i think we c should expect a good performance here this afternoon   that was a beautiful combination triple lutz triple toe  it doesn't quite have the same difficulty of viktor and kurt's combination but it was a beautiful combination none the less   and a gorgeous triple loop   he's on today   in watching petr i'm impressed by the way he's going out there and he's giving us a performance  he's not just skating an original program he's actually out there selling selling big time   he has a great ability to interpret the music and i think with that he may even break into the top three here  he's having a wonderful performance   an outstanding performance from the last skater of today's competition  it's gonna going to be difficult for the judges because now they're gonna going to have to remember back to whether or not they think this performance is  better equal to or less than that of christopher bowman's  he has brought the fans to their feet here at the olympiahalle   petr barna of czechoslovakia and he has just erased the memory of last year's original program in halifax when he was ninth   he certainly moved up in the long program to fifth overall but this has erased the memory of that poor performance a year ago  well technically he's very equal to the program of christopher bowman  here's the triple lutz triple toe combination which is the same combination that that christopher bowman performed  just a reminder tomorrow night the showdown continues  with kurt browning viktor petrenko and petr barna   and later this evening eisler and brasseur skate for gold in the pairs' competition   and barna and bowman and eldredge all could impact on how the judges decide who will be the champion this year because they could take marks away from petrenko or kurt browning  well i think we're looking at a situation where tomorrow night that last group is just gonna going to bring this house down  we've just seen some examples of skating today that if they all skate up to what they've executed today we're in for an excellent excellent final  he has shown remarkable cool waiting almost two and a half hours to skate  i would like to think that he did not get into this building until this event was at least half over  well here come the marks for required elements  for petr barna  he has been the czech champion since eighty-six and a five three from the yugoslavian judge but the rest of the marks up to five sevens but the crowd not happy with that first set of marks  as barb predicted he has moved ahead of christopher bowman into third place and it's just the sort of thing that he's probably wished for all his life  here are the second set of marks and there's his six from the hungarian judge  the yugoslavian was uh  judge has him five three five three into fifth place but  everyone else liked him  it's proba
