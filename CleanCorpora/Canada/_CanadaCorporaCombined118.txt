 so it's sortasort of hard to get my fish  stuff in  mm  wow  but i decorated the uhm door  i bought the thing from moyers it has ocean  oh  it's so neat  and it has like three d things coming out and kids love  that  wow  like and all the teachers are really excited about  that so  mm hmm  tha yeah that's fun   uhm and besides that everything's going okay   but uhm  how did that uhm system work out   for the teacher the uhm  the sound system  cool  well  the sound system  yes  uhm they're not getting it  it's too expensive  okay  it was fifteen hundred dollars for each classroom  so it was really  one or two words  oh wow  so how long did you have it for  it's actually still in our class and nobody uses it now  hmm  hmm  i guess itit was the novelty sort of  wore off  right  like we were all so excited and now it's just  word  ooh and you can put in this fish tape the ocean like tape and it group laughs  while you were talking while you were talking i was thinking of going to the floor uhm next door and they have all the tapes of that  that must be so great for you  okay yeah  of you can get the ocean and  i hadn't thought of that  yeah yeah  mm hmm     yeah     that'd be so cool  and if you put it on the surround sound thing  they'll one or two words  group laughs  i was thinking of reading that story that we've been talking about  yes  word talking about the mood and i was thinking of ways that i can do that     yeah  yes  yeah so i might do that   that would be good  so i'm gonnagoing to do that  that would be good  and i also said to a few words  the last time i was there  if y if you got a hockey net     a few words  you know and just sort of put it across   they have a small class so you can't really do everything   in you know on the floor     mm hmm  but if you had a hockey net and sort of draped it over the ceiling and then stuffed fish you know with paper and  then you sort of have  them sort of   floating in there you have like a     yeah     cough   but i was wondering  how would you  you mean you have to take off the net part right from  or even a uh a hammock  just a net  or a hammock  yeah   but but only if it's like a see-through kind of thing     yeah     yeah  yeah yeah     you know like not one of these laugh  group laughter     a few words     phrase  phrase     yes dyeah  anything that's sort of netty or see-through   uh could be used to be draped across uhm a  corner  yeah  like laundry bags  like the laundry bags for camping  exactly that's a word  like those camp laundry bags would be good  yeah  well the school must have some badminton nets or rope or things  or even if you just tie uhm   tie yarn     yeah  tie threethree or four  five lines strings on  knots  and then just pa paper clip them     strips   oh no no no  i tried that for word  laugh and it collapsed on me laugh  oh okay  laugh  a few words  yeah  you know what  it's much easier if you have something  readymade  ya yeah  and if you have a big sort of net fabric  yeah  just to drape it around  yeah  just so that you can see if you do an art activity and you have them sort of make fish and  oh yeah   yeah     and then you can sort of have them     hanging   from the ceiling   into the  net   add some shells word  how word  fish a few words       a few words  that's right  mm hmm  well i'm also making a big river   i told the kids i'm doing this
