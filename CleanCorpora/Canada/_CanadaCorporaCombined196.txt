 that's right  they put all of their weight so that they're not just down one straight line so the it's a little bit offset  and it allows them to get their wrist and it's easier on their wrist  and that brush gets very very heavy don  i tried it when the girls were practicing one afternoon and it is very very heavy compared to an ordinary brush   and jodi sutton the b c third also uses that brush when she throws a stone  the others go to the more conventional straight handled brush when they deliver a rock   okay now the importance of a lead  you heard julie sutton talking with our colleen jones that she wants to play a tight guard so this'll be a sign of a good lead  a tight tight guard   let's see how close she is to making this shot   karri willms now that was   was almost perfectly  now how's that for accuracy   now that's tight  that's about two inches away from the top of the word  now that's tight enough eh colleen  that is very tight laugh   sh heidi's gotta got to hit it  but she can roll on here   yeah but maybe a fraction too close to the circles  because it allows new brunswick maybe to hit and roll into the rings  it changes the whole complexion of the end   mary harding gets a nose hit on that b c stone  we mentioned earlier that she has only been curling for six years  she did not take up the sport until she was thirty and it was kathy floyd who convinced her to participate in the sport of curling   you have to admire uh julie sutton skip of the british columbia rink  two years ago in kelowna she was skipping what was considered by many to be a dream team with former world champions pat sanders and georgina hawkes on the team o as well as melissa soligo and  julie got off to a little bit of a rough start  she was bumped down to second stone   and that might have shattered s a person's confidence but she bounced back from that and uh is just stronger than ever   another thing the b c rink has going for them aside from being teammates they are such close friends  three of them melissa and julie and jodi all live together so there's no escaping each other   well they certainly do spend a lot of time together   about one hundred games this rink has played this year   they won the final in salmon arm when they were one down  with last rock coming home they scored two to defeat kerrylynn richard of kelowna in that final game   mary harding delivers her stone to the twelve foot   new brunswick lies one   that's the stone that julie sutton has asked melissa soligo to remove   oh she might've missed this one   aw   not enough to get it out of the rings  don i actually think she touched that corner guard and just  straightened the rock up enough to make contact with that rock at the back   the opportunity now exists for new brunswick to put two rocks into the house and two points in this particular point in the game  is very very large   this is the toughest shot in curling don a draw to the outside  cos you're going in an area where not too many rocks have been played it's a little bit heavier and not only that you're going against the circles  you're running out of the house to draw to  look at that  that's perfect don  that's beautiful curling  sherri stewart places that stone in the twelve  new brunswick lies two   don after five ends sherri stewart is curling ninety-three percent   another perfect shot there   melissa soligo at eighty-five percent   is she a little inside again   yes she's going to wreck out front but she does catch a piece  of that shot rock  she was a little fortunate there  she wrecked on the guard but caught a piece of that new brunswick stone and was fortunate enough to remove it  well if she hits that rock that guard a little bit thicker she rolls right out of play and then new brunswick s has a free draw for it to lie three   a little bit of a break but that's part of the game of curling   if there's one thing you have to go have going for you they are the breaks  i was talking to julie earlier in the week and there were four games during the round robin even though she only lost one but there were four other games that she even admits she could have and perhaps should have lost but she got the break in that last end when the other skip would miss or   this may be a break for b c   it just slides through the rings   and now julie sutton can focus her attention on that stone at the back of the twelve   the sutton twins were telling me they can remember going uh to the curling club as kids with their parents and they knew they were taking the game seriously when their parents lost in a mixed game and they went into the washroom and cried their eyes out for their parents'  losses   jodi sutton catches a corner of that new brunswick stone at the back of the twelve   heidi hanlon is going to persist in keeping the play over on the right-hand side of that twelve-foot ring  well that's what she wants to do you know and uh i think uh heidi uh feels that the b c team is really not overpowering them with their great takeout ability cos they have just touched uh three rocks  and not only that the reason she's playing over there don that's where she wants to play because she has last rock but there's a rock just outside the rings and that may act as a little bit of a uh protection for her  maybe b c will drive it on to that one at the back and that's why she's playing over there as opposed to playing it in the open side  well for that portion of the twelve-foot circle this new brunswick team has weight down perfectly   now there have been two takeouts down there   both by melissa soligo and they really made a move at the end don so i'm sure that's going through jodi sutton's mind that melissa may throw in at pretty well up the broom and they really curl so she's   gonna going to have be very conscious of her weight here   keep her weight up cos ya you know the rock's gonna going to curl at the end   wanna want to make sure they don't drive it on that one at the back   well she did catch a piece of that stone at the back but  in the process removed it as well as the object stone  the shooter sits in the twelve  b c lies one  that's a great shot by jodi sutton   and a good call by julie sutton on that rock don because she has to hit it at the right angle to remove that one at the back which potentially could've been a danger to 'em them as the end progressed   kathy floyd with a nose hit who's been a rather prominent athlete in the province of new brunswick over the years  seven times she has represented the province in golf competition four times as a junior golfer three as an amateur  representative and three times on a national softball team  she's a great all-round athlete and it gives her a mental toughness from participating in so many sports   used to the pressure   colleen when you were playing new brunswick did you think they uh do you feel they favoured the in-turn  no they were fairly consistent with both turns  the reason i ask that is because they like to play the  with the outside-in in-turns all the time and b c are playing out-turns   well when it doesn't really matter which turn you take it just comes down to personal preference   or if you have a better release on the in-turn versus the out-turn   mental preparation mental toughness an important part of curling competition as well as the actual art of delivering a stone  well you can't get over-anxious  you have to be patient and like uh julie says you have to  calm yourself down   well kathy floyd may have laryngitis but heidi hanlon has no problems yelling   laugh yeah   she certainly lets you know whether you're to sweep or not  well she is just making up for kathy's zina uh laryngitis but that's the second hit she's had there that s  she's just gotten out   well julie put it right on the button in the fifth end and we'll see if she can uh put it on the tee-line here which is exactly the centre of the sheet  runs through the centre of the rings   well you get   a little bit shorter of that line tee-line   but good draw weight   well i think the sutton twins are somewhat relieved that  the worst that will happen on this end is that they will give up a single point  in the early stages of this end it looked as though new brunswick with last rock advantage might pick up two or even more   heidi hanlon not happy with that shot  she wanted to roll out   she picks up a single point with last rock on the sixth end  and so the score after six ends is new brunswick three british columbia two  you are watching the scott tournament of hearts live on sports weekend tv advertisements   neither side has been able to score more than a single point through six ends of play in this championship game at the scott tournament of hearts  new brunswick's heidi hanlon leading julie sutton of british columbia by a score of three two  in round robin play b c ten and one new brunswick eight and three  new brunswick with a victory nine seven on an extra end last night  over two-time canadian champion heather houston of thunder bay in the semi-final   well it's nice to have the bye straight into the final  most curlers would agree that it's uh great to play that semi-final if there's any way that you can be guaranteed to win because you're in a pressure-filled situation it's a game you've got to win  and you get a chance to play on this sheet of ice again   i think that applies in almost any sport colleen  if you were guaranteed success in a semi-final game rather than be inactive for a period of time leading up to a championship you would like to play  like to keep your competitive edges sharp  that's right  unfortunately there are no guarantees   melissa soligo will corner that yellow-handled new brunswick stone rolling it out  the shooter also rolls out of play   interesting end here uh for new brunswick don  there is a corner guard up belonging to british columbia and they may want to utilize it because they have last rock   heidi hanlon's saying to julie sutton okay julie i don't care about that corner guard  i'm going to put one up on the centre and you cannot ignore it  you have to hit it because if you don't i'm gonna  going to go around it and steal another point and i'm  gonna going to have real control of this game  so it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game going on here  and as the end progresses you know that may change a little bit but for now heidi hanlon's saying to julie sutton well i'm  gonna going to try and steal a point  i don't care about your corner guards   and julie sutton of course knows the danger of a centre guard and she's running it off  what she's trying to do now don is maybe hit and roll off to the corner a bit   you see that sherri stewart has out-performed as far as percentages go her b c counterpart melissa soligo
