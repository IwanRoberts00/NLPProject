 it uh says something or other on the bottom on this  i can't make out what it says but it's either bohemian or czechoslovakian or something i dunno  don't know   oh   yeah something cut  hand cut  hand cut lead glass  laugh lead   uh oh yes it is  yeah   yeah  if you don't want it i'd like to keep them   oh really  yeah  hand cut  oh yes well sure you can have it if you want  i think jan didn't want it  mm but   no  yeah  actually uh there are three things here this this and this if you don't want them uh i'd like to keep them  oh yes okay sure   mm mm   i always liked this actually laugh   yeah yah it's different you know   i quite like that  ah i can remember being kind of fascinated with that as a child but  rooster eggcup oh  laugh okay   mm hmm   yeah it's an unusual eggcup in that it holds a large egg  oh  well this holds an even larger egg  well that's true   you realize that this is an eggcup  yes i know  that's the way it's held   oh ho  right  okay  i woulda would of used  that one   okay anyway you don't recognize these glasses  no  okay i'm going to keep them then puffs   i don't think i recognize them anyway   well you should have some vague familiarity i mean    i mean you would have run into them at some point in the cupboard possibly  well   well no i'm not used to running into that  cupboard  mm i see  yeah  okay any this uh use for that  no   no  or this  no   mm fifty cents  fifty cents yes   okay what about that wood dish  no  monkey pot holder   yeah undoubtedly  yes  the woods of hawaii honolulu's finest of waikiki   monty monkey pot monkey-pot is an american tree   now i dunno don't know if this was something that she picked up yeah it was probably something she picked up on her first trip  she either picked it up or people used to come back from hawaii with that kind of thing all the time  she had several   yeah i know right   yeah yeah   we dumped some of them before   yeah there's sigh word   oh my  i'd forgotten completely about these little  uhm   those probably are rather valuable  yes they are  uhm are we gonna going to get rid of them word   no i think i probably shouldn't just get rid of them  no   wilton   wilton fine china  no these these uhm should be retained  no   these are genuine antiques  yes   i think i'm not sure but i think that these were hers when she was a girl  ehm probably  no no these   probably   yeah i should at least uhm uhm  two or three words   you can put it over here   mh okay  hurry it up   mm  are you gonna going to keep the sugar tongs  no  i don't need these  no   nor do i  laugh   i don't suppose ever anyone  uses sugar tongs anymore cos no one uses cubes of sugar  no in fact i haven't seen sugar cubes for some time   draws in breath hm   okay  yeah oh yeah   oh yeah so what did uh the rest of the  pivo   oh yeah uh   uhhh how do you turn that off  over at the wall   oh uh   yeah it says i guess you just push on it yes   uhm hmnah stop tape cut off   yes okay no uhm i don't think i'll have any more  pivo   actually i'll leave you with the bottle   all i want back is the empty bottle  mm hmm  so uhm  yeah ah uh i think that thomas and i will probably go to a different place to uh make our next batch  oh  yeah the uh er   do you want these glasses   no   ten cents each  we we have a couple of those  word   do you  yeah  well if you ha you   have a couple of these why don't you take them   mm yah yeah yeah might as well to uhm  complete the set yeah   yah mm   then you'll have four  yeah  they're juice glasses  yes two words   actually joshua rather liked it uhm  ah i guess he still likes it   uh because we well it was a nice size for word yeah   oh yes yeah   uhm  okay  joshua went out for his uh first football  word football first soccer game in uh we  well ever in organized soccer yeasterday  uhm and his team won  mm hmm  i was really surprised and impressed  mm hmm  he uhm he gets in there and  plays  mm hmm  and he knows what to do  oh  ahm and   how long did how long does  that go on  uhm oh it's interesting  it goes on until the twenty- seventh pronounced twentyyyyy-ssssssseventh i think of june and then there's a month's hiatus and it c re word   uhm the th uhm third of august or something like that  oh how often is it  it's once a week  oh   that's it   mm  well anthony was doing an assignment yesterday too   of of   he he had to talk or he had to do something artistic about the creative person  and last week they had to write ah some sort of a  a short essay about this creative person   and this week they had to do something artistic that represented the activities of the creative person  mm hmm  well what anthony did was uh wrote about his uh grandmother  not maeve   mm hmm  about   his nanny  who uh various times has written poetry  uh has done stained glass painting uh drawing and uhm also taught ballet  mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm   mm hmm  she was also a bell telephone operator at one point  mm  uhm that was when she was doing uh learning ballet and also taking her classes  but uhm uh he er his conception  was to show ah in some ways the way in which she progressed through some of the phases of her her own work  mm hmm  and uh put it together in a kind of a collage  was actually really good in in   showing the uhm doing a kind of an  in ini in a way an imitation of her work  mm  and uh tape cuts out   word hear munching and stuff  speakers are eating as they speak for the whole conversation   no i think it's okay  uhm yeah in terms of the fish aquarium actually uhm  did you turn it on  yes it's on  oh   uhm let me think  i put it in in november  we came we moved in in november and i cleaned it for the first time in april  no  ya  so like i emptied all the water out wiped it out rinsed off the uhm the uh gravel and uhm and then replenished the water  okay   it's off at the moment because uhm we didn't wanna want to have the background noise  uhm and uh  okay   so it's off and the light's off as well  but it's it's pretty maintenance-free really when you consider  and i and i don't expect to have to clean this as often cos i only have one fish in there now  and when i had the two   did one die  yes one passed away  thelma passed away  it was a very sad event in my life  ah  laugh   she was smaller and i think she uh she   just here's here's a fork   uh   i found one  okay    they gave me one they didn't tell me  she was smaller and uhm i guess she just  she probably wasn't uh wasn't  well when i got her  cos i was always having to take her out of there and put her in sick bay  i had a little bowl at the side and i'd take some water and scoop it in and put her in and she'd seem to get better and i'd put her back in the aquarium and she'd get sick again  so she spent more time in sick bay than she did in the  bowl in the ah aquarium so  it's funny how even goldfish tend take  take on little personalities because i had some fish i don't think they were goldfish they were orange i forget  what they uh what they were called  oh yeah yeah   they were tropical  mm hmm  they were quite similar to goldfish and  there was one little guy  mm hmm   and he used to whizz around that tank  he we he he was really really tiny  yeah  and and i used to call him whizzer   and i was really i really grow not " grew"  fond of that silly little fish  yes  and he passed away like it was awwww  laugh   but when you think about it laugh   yeah i was just a little devastated when the little one went cos i i kept because i had kept nursing her  you know it was harder i mean if i'd just come in and found her dead i think it would have been easier to deal with but  that's right   but you did all you could and then she still passed on  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  it's too bad   but uhm he has quite a personality cos i when i was cleaning the aquarium i had to put him in the little bowl and he was very upset with the fact that he was in this little bowl  and he must be quite uhm uh er sensitive to noise because whenever i would walk in or if there was a flash of light he would zip around the bowl about five or six times frantically  mm hmm  uhm and i i never see him do that in there  so i guess uh he was showing his displeasure at the fact that he was in this uh little bowl  but it's we don't have water here so it's very awkward in terms of like you know notice if the  there's been a lot of water that has been depleted from the aquarium just through ordinary uhm evaporation  and you're getting that's good cos you're getting natural evaporation of the water  it it's it is good for me yes and uhm  but i ha i find it  sigh awkward to find time two or three words   this sounds funny it only takes a coupla couple of  minutes to go and get some water and yet you're always so busy   and you're in your day that i mean how many times do you go to fill up water or or for the kettle or for the coffee whatever and yet can't find enough time to find water for the poor little fish   that's right   i have a poor plant that's not " that" you know  gets neglected  mm  my spider plant is going to be in dire straits if i don't water him tonight  and soak him  i'm jus i just noticed the trunk of that tree  mm   is that done on purpose  mm hmm  it is  mm hmm  two words   so you buy it like that  i got that at the greenhouse over in the hall  building from french name   mm hmm mmm   mm hmm  we bought could be 'buy' - speaker is eating  all our plants there   and um they're all doing well  the only one i didn't get from french name  is the bonsai which is now dead  uhm that was from sophia   it was a gift from her  mm hmm  when i left the office upstairs cos i helped her  so she sent me a bonsai  and i told her at the time i said i feel so guilty owning a bonsai cos i know it's going to die  what do you mean   and it did very well for a long time  but why would you say that  mm they need a lot of attention  yeah i gave one to my mother  i don't think it lasted very long   so your parents were married in thirty-nine   i think so  i don't know  it's funny with a lot of these things you take them for granted and you don't actually remember them   ya you don't always remember ya   i i was an adult before i figured out that my father was forty-three when i was born  ya ya  not not young ya  well when you're the youngest  how old was your dad when julia was born  that's true  ya   you know   ya cos i he was twenty-eight when i was born but julianne is uh nine years younger     mhh hmm
