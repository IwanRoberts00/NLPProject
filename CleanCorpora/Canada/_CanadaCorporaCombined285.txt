 people in canada use stationary bicycles to lose weight and then hop in their cars to go to work  we waste enormous amounts of food and energy  it doesn't seem fair that we waste while the poor starve  in canada we have many desirable accessories but at the expense of the poorer countries  we hoard many of the earth's resources to make us happy but we also make the south suffer  in canada i live in comfort i s but in colombia i see my friends struggling  i want to share my wealth give the things i own but don't need to people who do need them  why can't adults share as well   we never seem to be satisfied with what we have  we always want more for ourselves but we must break the selfish habit to learn to share our wealth  i'm here in brazil to tell the leaders of the rich country that we don't want to be so greedy anymore  to forgive the international debt and share our technology freely  any child can see that we need to share  thank you audience claps   french comments   as a child i have a hard time being heard and understood  but children experience nature in a way quite different from adults  i'm here to tell you now that i am not afraid to speak up for what i believe in and i believe in children  the purpose of these conferences is to create a healthy sustainable environment yet who are the ones we are making the decisions for  the children  and their futures should be of the utmost importance on your agendas  we are tomorrow's leaders and voters  we are the future keys to the earth's survival  we take every decision as an example for the way we will run  tomorrow's world  and frankly adults have not been setting a very good example  my an my grandmother used to tell me about fields where elephants and humans lived in harmony or places where if you were lost in the forest all you had to do was look for a certain tree or animal and you could find your way home  but now those animals are almost gone and i grieve for their loss  i sometimes wonder what kind of undiscovered species are disappearing from our planet  our clear-cut and burned forests leave us leave them nowhere to go  or what cures for our diseases lie within those forests   many a time i wish i could see an elephant or a panda bear in the wild or at least know they're there  but i realize that these animals are disappearing along with countless others  there are some that i wish to see that are already gone killed by poachers and hunters some pov sometimes impoverished sometimes rich  now i must tell you that i am scared  this speech was not written by an adult wanting to protect a major corporation  it was written by myself a child who has no hidden agendas and no companies to protect  i only wish to protect my future and those of other children  who are not able to speak today   help us before it is too late  we have no time to lose  please do it for the children  do it for our futures  thank you audience claps   i j i don't think it's  right for me to continue speaking after that  thank you very much   i think uh children have a way of cutting through a lot of the  complexities that adults create and seeing what the issues are in a very very simple and straightforward way  i thank you very much for sharing that with us   almost two thirds of alberta is forested  university of alberta professor doctor george landsend  explains what alberta's forests are like and where they came from  taped phone interview with guest speaker   from the beautiful and remote boreal forests of the far north  to the pure stands of lodgepole pine in the foothills alberta's blessed with a diversity of forests but not with a large number of species of trees  in fact just six species aspen white spruce  lodgepole and jack pine balsam poplar and black spruce make up ninety-seven percent of the volume of wood on alberta's so-called productive forest land  the province considers just over half of the forest land or thirty-five percent of alberta as productive commercial forests  the theory of modern sustained yield forest management is that if it takes a hundred years to grow a tree you only cut one one-hundredth of the trees each year  and if you do that you'll be able to cut trees forever  ron lowen is a well-known authour and a widely respected ecologist  i asked him if current forest management practices are sustainable taped phone interview with guest speaker   in fact of the seven foresters we interviewed including two well-known independent ecologists a former chief forester of a private company three prominent government foresters and one academic none would say our forests are sustainable under present management  i asked ron lowen what are the indicators that our forests aren't sustainable taped phone interview with guest speaker   essentially ron lowen is saying that the model of sustained yield forest management was designed to meet economic objectives but it doesn't protect biodiversity or the other non-fibre values in the forest and as a consequence it may not even ensure a sustained yield of fibre over the long-term  alberta's first pulp mill was opened in nineteen fifty-four in hinton by northwestern pulp and power limited  it was about that time when reg loomis alberta's first professional forester took the reins on behalf of the government  using aerial photographs he pioneered management of alberta's forest on a sustained yield basis  the theory is that timber harvesting will be forever sustainable  if you cut only the amount of wood that grows each year  in essence you live off the interest of tree growth without ever cutting into the principal  it was a very progressive concept and loomis made sure the concept worked its way into the province's very first forest management agreement  today there is growing recognition that forests especially public forests should be managed to sustain everything in the forest not just the volume of timber  john laberman is a forestry consultant with the forestry company in mcbride british columbia  he used to be the chief forester of ziedler forest products in edmonton  i asked him if what we're doing in the forests is sustainable  taped phone interview with guest speaker   luke lakeside is a forester with the alberta government  he is working on the model forest in hinton and the province's forest conservation strategy  he disagrees with ron lowen on the question of fibre sustainability  he thinks in most instances fibre production is sustainable but he does agree that sustainable forest management is more than just fibre production taped phone interview with guest speaker   in fact there's a quiet revolution going on in the woods  driven by the potentially explosive repercussions of the marketplace a new kind of forestry may be emerging  simon lionel a forester with the land and forests service  says the move is from sustained yield to sustainable forest management taped phone interview with guest speaker   by now you're probably beginning to realize that sustainability in the forest can be a bit of a shell game  but the debate is about sustaining forests and not just trees  next week we'll try to find out what forest sustainability is  and what's being done to ensure alberta's forests are going to be around for future generations end of show segment introduction to next show   forests cover about two-thirds of alberta and most of the forest is relatively young  about seventy percent is less than a hundred and twenty years old  fire is probably the most important natural force in alberta's forest ecosystems  more than seventy-five percent of alberta's forests have burned in the last fifty years and unlike the temperate rainforests of b c  british columbia alberta's forests are composed mostly of a half dozen species or so  one out of every two trees in alberta is an aspen  aspen is that handsome white bark tree seen in groves throughout the province's forested ecosystems  aspen and balsam poplar are in the salicaceae family along with willows and this is where acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin was derived from  in fact almost half of the medicines prescribed today were originally derived from plants and that is partly why protecting biodiversity in forests has become a world-wide issue   in nineteen eighty-five only about one quarter of the annual allowable cut of trees was allocated to forest companies in alberta  the annual allowable cut is calculated based on the annual growth rate of trees  if a tree takes one hundred years to grow then your allowable cut is one one-hundredth of the trees in your forest  today ninety-five percent of the coniferous or pine spruce and fir allowable cut has been allocated and seventy-three percent of the deciduous trees such as aspen have been promised to forestry companies  more public forest lands have been allocated to forestry operations in the last decade than in all of alberta's previous history  it was the government of premier donald getty that looked to forestry when alberta faced plunging oil prices in the mid nineteen-eighties  as a sustainable development strategy the concept of harvesting trees may not be a bad idea but in the headlong rush to develop alberta's northern forests some critics argue wildlife biodiversity and science were left behind  today spurred on by environmental protests abroad and controversy at home forest companies are making changes  overharvesting in british columbia and some very public fights over pollution and allocation of the public forests in alberta have tarnished forestry's image  the industry's scrambling to improve its image and protect its markets  in the early nineteen-nineties the alberta government's answer was to write a new vision for government that called for ecosystem sustainability  it was largely a symbolic beginning but the word ecosystem had finally crept into the practice of forestry  samuel lamberthad is a policy advisor with the alberta government taped phone interview with guest speaker   ecosystem sustainability may have become part of the language of the day but the indicators of success in forestry were still annual allowable cut and reforestation  both are indicators of fibre production but not forest sustainability  in last week's program nearly every forester we spoke to agreed that what's being practised today is sustained yield management and not sustainable forest management  understanding the difference between these two concepts is critical in sorting out the important issues in forestry today  doctor mark lathe is the ecologist who wrote the book on canada's forest ecosystems  he's the authour of canada's areas of foliage and more recently he wrote home short pieces on ecological subjects   i asked him how he would define sustainable forest management  taped phone interview with guest speaker   lathe's idea is to pass the forests on to our children  in the same condition as they were given to us  this sounds reminiscent of sustainable development as defined by the united nations brentland commission  old growth forest ecologist and authour ron lowen shares  lathe's view and elaborates taped phone interview with guest speaker   ron lowen says if poor management results in a deficit  for either the choice of our children or in the land's productive capacity we will have in effect stolen resources from our children  that's how two well-known ecologists would define sustainable forest management but what about government  samantha lanolyn is the senior policy advisor who represented alberta when the canadian council of forest ministers defined sustainable forest management and created a system of indicators  taped phone interview with guest speaker   the system of eighty-three indicators created by the forestry ministers is far more complex than the loan indicator now being used by the alberta government in its annual measuring up report  it also adds significantly to the traditional indicators such as reforestation success and annual allowable cut however according to  samuel lamberthad the alberta government is also creating its own definition of sustainable forest management taped phone interview with guest speaker   critics of the forest conservation strategy charge that talk is cheap  nevertheless lamberthad says the government intends to redefine the way it does forestry based on the definition of sustainable forest management that emerges from the process  next week could sustainable forest management mean an end to clear-cuts or the creation of the largest clear-cut on earth  find out as we present part three in our series on sustainable forestry end of show segment introduction to next show
