 good morning  i'm gus mcbain   and i'm julie maverins   this is world report  in the news today bedlam at queens park  the opposition stages an all-night protest in the ontario legislature  forgive us our sins churches apologize to native groups for residential schools  and rendez-vous with jupiter the galileo space probe ends a six year journey through space  it has been a very long night at the ontario legislature  about a dozen opposition members are gathered around a liberal member to prevent the sergeant-at-arms from removing him from the chamber  yesterday the speaker ordered liberal m p p member of the provincial parliament alvin curling expelled when he refused to vote on a bill  that's a violation of house rules  as phil hastings reports the controversial bill from the conservative government is at the centre of the political storm  the flashpoint for the opposition's anger is the bill the harris government says it must pass to implement the six billion dollar spending cut it announced last week  but the opposition says this is much more than money bill  among other things they say it gives the government the right to redraw municipal boundaries and even look at people's private medical records  they accuse harris of trying to ram through a huge chunk of his legislative agenda all at once so unpopular policies could be slipped by without debate  the opposition's price for ending what has effectively become a sit-in is for the government to break the bill down into several smaller bills then submit the pieces to extensive public hearing  conservative house leader ernie eaves says he's willing to negotiate but  i'm not going to do it while they are holding the legislative assembly hostage and while they refuse to complete a vote  i mean this is an affront to parliamentary democracy as we know it  liberal leader lynne mcleod says alvin curling and the opposition are willing to stay put until eaves agrees to public hearing  that is not asking a lot of a government that is making sweeping and fundamental changes that give them incredible powers  close to thirty m p p's from both sides sat through the night  some read and some slept some did their christmas cards  once every hour conservative members held up posters of a dollar sign  the tories claim every hour the bill to cut government spending is delayed a million dollars in interest is added to the ontario debt  phil hastings c b c news toronto  canadian soldiers will soon be heading back to bosnia  the first of up to a thousand troops will begin leaving for the balkans before christmas  they'll become part of the multi-national force of sixty thousand from nato  canada's defence minister says a thousand soldiers will satisfy nato commanders  but some military analysts disagree devon asper has more  canada had been asked to contribute a larger force of up to sixteen hundred  but defence minister david collenette insists canada's contribution will please nato headquarters in brussels  this is uhh within the acceptable range that we had been discussing with the nato commanders  i think they'll be quite happy  and collenette says canadians will be pleased as well  it goes without saying that canadians would expect us  to uh if we're part of the nato organization to be there  especially at this historic time when uh nato in effect  is changing its direction after forty years and take on a very meaningful security role  but some defence analysts believe canada is taking the easy way out  i would have hoped for a a much more substantial contribution   don jorgenson is a retired colonel and former editor of the canadian defence quarterly  jorgenson says canada could have done more it should have done more  i wonder how much our contribution is going to matter  and i think that needs to be a matter of something  accounted for us   we wanted to contribute to something uh to an operation where it made a difference  the commitment to the peace process in bosnia will cost canadian tax payers just under fifty million dollars  collenette says the canadian soldiers will stay in bosnia for one year and then come home  devon asper c b c news ottawa  paul martin has set a new target for federal deficit reduction  the finance minister said yesterday he intends to slash the deficit to two percent of gross domestic product by nineteen ninety-seven  that means a deficit of about seventeen billion dollars  half of what it is today  but as joanne murphy reports the reform party says the target is still too high  everybody agree with the the  objective of uh uh reducing uh deficit of federal government  actually it's rare to get agreement on something in ottawa  but yvan loubier of the bloc qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois  says everyone wants deficit reduction  the problem is there's no consensus on the pace of cutting back  finance minister paul martin says he's moving as fast as he can  a single-minded dash to a zero deficit would be counterproductive in every sense  but don't say that to preston manning of the reform party  he's not impressed with the new target  and he's repeating what has become a mantra for reform  i think you know what we're going to say  and that is that you are not going far enough fast enough  with respect to spending reduction  but other reform members seem almost surprised that martin is moving so fast  his finance critic herb grubel says most of the cuts from the last budget have yet to work their way through the system  so it'll be quite the challenge to slash even more  i can just envision the pressures that are going to build up and what you will have to face  canadians don't yet know the specifics of what they'll face in further cutbacks  for details they'll have to wait until february for the next budget  joanne murphy c b c news ottawa  the investigation into the airbus scandal has been stalled by a legal challange launched in switzerland  a canadian justice department official says someone has filed a case in switzerland challenging canada's efforts to obtain confidential banking records  it isn't known who filed the

 the swiss agreed to freeze certain bank accounts but any account holder has the right to file an appeal  the country's major churches will unite today in an apology for the decades of abuse of native people in residential schools  for decades aboriginal children were taken from their parents  they were put into boarding schools where their own cultural and religious beliefs were banned  the church apology for those years of assimilation will be part of what's being called a sacred assembly in hull hull  quebec  corrine johnson has the story  i learned to be ashamed because i was an indian  i learned to be ashamed of my language because i was told it belonged to the devil  colleen stanley is a seventy year-old elder from saskatchewan  she remembers her years in a catholic residential school as if they were yesterday  especially a vivid picture painted in one hallway  a mural that gave her nightmares as a little girl  parents carrying their little children by the hand into hell  because they're indian  stanley got kicked out of that residential school at sixteen with a grade six education  she became an alcoholic before recovering and going to university  she says she doesn't blame the roman catholic church  she blames the government for its policies of enforced assimilation  but six major churches including the catholic united and anglican  are expected to make an official apology for their role in the residential school system  father matt cosby of the conference of catholic bishops says it's an effort to heal the wounds of the past  all the churches that are working with the native people in terms of uhh justice issues and and  rec reconciliation making efforts towards reconciliation  it's one of the reasons we're here  some apologies have already been made by church groups involved in residential schools  but their words at this sacred assembly are designed to finally put the past to rest and get on with building a new relationship with aboriginal
