morning  so ya once   are you   well haven't you noticed she's lost a little bit of weight  you mentioned  well no but i mean can you not notice  ya i ya you do notice  huh no cos i'm not really sure uhm i know if we go back to the vet in july and she says anything about   i've been doing some reading and they said laugh there are some vets that are actually forcing weight reduction programs on their clients  really   well certainly   well ya it's in the best interest of the dog  i have a friend whose uhm bassett hound died of  obesity  it broke its back  oh my gosh  ya but you're talking about a dog with short legs  too  you know phrase   uh short uh short short legs and a wide girth  still you'd think you'd notice once the dog was getting fat  i dunno don't know   you'd hope you'd notice anyway   i know   my vet told me that i was supposed to brush  prince prince 's teeth  did you ever get anywhere with that  i know   no  laugh boony was at the vet today and he bought the dog some mouthwash  laugh   ehm he says the dog's teeth are too yellow  well they're quite dirty actually  it will apparently uhm prolong the like  the the cleaning that's required ev  every two years or whatever i don't actu  actually at a vet's office   you can prolong the the period between those visits  it's just  i don't actually   well i don't know i grew up with dogs   and we never brought our dogs to the dentist  ever  laugh really   well but times have changed  i don't know i think it's too faddish myself  faddish  well  too much of a fad  ya   noel tell me about this  placement interview then   the one at the y y m c a   ya   it sounds pretty interesting   laugh as i said before laugh it's got two parts to it there'd be either i be working   in either with groups doing self-help  there're self help groups there   hmm   you've got a number of different kinds  there's the they had one this year on body image but i think it just finished  and then the one that keeps go  going that they have most involvement with is the incest survivors adul adults  incest survivors who are adults   mhhm  and that's goi going   that would involve being sort of coordinating the groups running the groups and then being there for crisis  if there's any kind of crisis intervention needed that would be they hopefully would turn to me  hmm  and if i wanted to do individual counselling i can do that as well  are there that's that's  how is the y subsidized for that program do you know  and then   the self-help stuff  ya  i'm not sure  because i know on the radio yesterday they were talking about they were making reference to that woman  who was recently killed by her husband and how the legal system basically failed to recognize all of the signs even though she was saying that you know her husband had made threats against her and this sort of thing  and she was just recently murdered   is that the one that uhm the c l s c   centres locaux de services communautaires , community health authority social workers knew from the husband that he wanted to  yes yes and they didn't do anything about it   and she had warned about it too hadn't she  exactly  and the p police   and the police were supposed to be involved as well  and what happened was uhm you know the police basically said well what do you expect us to do provide twenty-four hour surveillance   and i mean i think the argument was that yes i mean you do   uhm   when there's been a threat  uhm exactly  so anyways they were talking about making recommendations to  you know what would happen if everytime there's been a complaint like that or a threat like that that you know what the police was trying to what the police were trying to say was that uhm you can't take every threat seriously because people tend to say those things all the time  but it di hadn't there been   a history of abuse as well  well i don't know  i didn't did you know anything about the case cos i hadn't heard anything  you know they didn't really say that much  very little ah i assumed there'd been a history of abuse especially if they were involved with the c l s c for counselling  ya  so anyways but one of the recommendations that what they were making is that social workers should become integrated within the police force as  to intervene and do  counselling with cases rather than waiting them to go to  ah transition houses   when i   mhhm   when i was when i was   living in london i working with the dist   distress the london distress centre there  and part of the one of the training things that i went to there was with the police and they were talking about they'd just started a program where social workers were working with the   p police in conjunction with   the police was that actually in the police force   and uhm that when they the police responded to a domestic violence call then the social worker would go as well  mhhm   mhhm  mhh  and that it was the social worker basically who was intervening and the the police were the ones who were making sure that nothing worse happened or nothing else happened ensuring the safety of everybody there  mhhm   and it sounded like it was an excellent program  my supervisors supervisor at d y p  director of youth protection where i was working this year uhm  pam lafleur she's starting that here with the montreal  police force working with them especially in terms of sexual abuse and child sexual abuse  having social workers working with the police force and they're responding to cases like that  lay down andy   mhhm   cos often at dw at youth protection  you'd get a call about se sexual  about sexual ab abuse   about child sexual abuse and then they'd often have a police person going in going and interviewing the child as well without a social worker there and it  often the police weren't trained at all in that kind of  thing word   well no they're there for totally different purposes  mhh   ya and it ended up that they've had some really bad kind of results  not always obviously but often some really negative results in the child  mhhm   oftentimes the police forces will uhm  will request kind of coalition or this kind of working together you know  with other professions  professionals   mhhm   mhhm   the new director at mcgill for social work todd stone   i went to his job talk the one just before he   before   was it the lecture he did before  chr christmas uh just after christmas  ya and it was before he was hired it was sort of like his test  right  mhhm  and uhm he he's been working on that in new brunswick nova scotia   newfoundland   newfoundland   newfoundland okay   close  somewhere over there     laugh   right region  okay and he's been working again with child sexual abuse as a police with the police   force getting social workers and police working in conjunction  and says that they've been going through a training program the police and the social workers in it that  so that the s training program is run by  a police person and a social worker     cough   mhhm
