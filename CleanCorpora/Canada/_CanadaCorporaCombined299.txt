 psychologists inform us cough that boys of fifteen to seventeen may be the most sex-dominated creatures on earth   if i na want was that i wanted it kept it strictly private   my horniness i could not then have expressed it that way was a burden i carried in absolute private files an ogre to be wrestled with and occasionally indulged somehow or word or loved and fought with again fought over or into true guilt and then  inev inevitably back into guilt again with remorse and inner rage   so given that to hear such tangled privacies brayed about the streets by the other young grunts in our work gang every time a beautiful girl  they were all beautiful always  every time a girl became visible embarrassed and humiliated me  wolf whistles cries howls obscene offers brutal and violent gestures  the older immigrant men worked on oblivious  after surviving both stalin and hitler they must have found these endlessly repeated performances merely trivial and banal  but i listened  i couldn't stop myself though i mostly pretended to ignore them as i tried to ignore the sexual bragging about weekend conquests  and so i came to prefer the depths of the trench   from below at least they sounded indistinct merely animals yowling   the young engineer spoke very little  he never said a word when a woman passed   sometimes he would smile but he kept on working  one of his main jobs was to make certain that the sewer was laid absolutely on gradient and that's where his arguments with the foreman started  time and again to prove his points about the violation of benchmarks he had set i'd have to slide down into the cool sweet earth and work my extended measuring rod as directed from one joint to another along those interlaced pipes and he'd sight at each with his level and then he'd be expostulating with the foreman again  you put that little bump like you say when you lay the pipe  and you cut capacity look almost a third   diagrams formulas circled numbers racing left-handed across the spiral notebook with that ever sharp precise draftsman pen   the sewer is a cynic   it tells all   the longest biggest line cut down main street which was also alberta highway number four from mountain view pass to lethbridge just recently paved of course so we really sliced it up  wide and mountainous along the north side and the smaller branch sitting  right angles   you go right down the middle of the str   street uh side of the street and then you go out right angles to each of the buildings   after carving up the residential streets with feeder lines we had begun very deep eighteen feet perhaps on the east main and as august lengthened the huge trencher steadily chewed us inch by inch towards the town hotel near the western end of the business district and the arguments got louder  you do that you gotta got to lay twice the diameter  it's supposed to handle all this town's shit   throughout the summer i had wondered how whoever it was had decided on the various sizes of pipes anyway   had they interviewed every homeowner and business about the length of residence and then gone into each outhouse and measured it for hole capacity and percentage fill   besides all the other crap that always gets word  shoved into sewers the engineer muttered grimly to me who had no opinion but at dislocated moments might provide an ear  shit apparently was the least of it   why in this sewer summer of nineteen fifty-two at eighty-two cents an hour it made the m it was the most i'd ever earned did i begin with hugo rather than with any other modern library giant two ninety-five each then cough like cervantes word pushkin joyce tolstoy that   the ones i bought latter   perhaps it was cough because of its giant intestine  the cloaca which as hugo explains it has been the disease of paris throughout history  in part five of les mis&eacute;rables he describes it for fifteen pages and then he devotes another twenty-three to getting jean valjean with marius on his shoulder out of that sewer  well why   why did i buy this book  perhaps to be blunt about it i was wondering how i dealt how one dealt with shit   clearly   how did one   clearly the world including me was full of it and here on the apparently open prairie there was neither enough there were neither enough bushes nor even spaces as it seemed to me there'd always been in estevan saskatchewan where i lived the first twelve years of my life there weren't enough there were not  bushes nor spaces for it to be properly voided unseen and thereafter to be b permitted the privacy of its individual disintegration   in sunny southern alberta it seemed necessary to rip up the landscape and yell about it in the streets   cough holding this immense novel in my hand in nineteen ninety-one i am suddenly certain that i bought it originally because of the sewer for i had read the story much earlier in saskatchewan when i was eleven a simplified version by solomon cleaver that had from somewhere contained pictures  in that one room treadwell school i'm reading jean valjean as the book is called leaning against the warm galvanized guard of the heater which is two gas barrels welded together  on the temporary stage across the one end of the room five girls are practicing good king wenceslas for the christmas concert  the black and white picture when i turn the page is captioned  jean carries the wounded marius to safety through the filthy sewers of paris   jean is lank-haired old man  his face contorted  above his waist in what seems to be molten lead   behind him the glooming maw of the sewer twists away into darkness  carried to safety  when i go to find jean valjean in the university library i discover it in the canadian literature section   it seems solomon cleaver was a young minister of winnipeg who decided to tell the stories in his own words rather like hulbert with the bible  not even god could write well enough for him  the reverend cleaver repeated the story more than eight hundred times to over one hundred thousand people and was obliged to reject one invitation every four which crowded upon him  so the publishing word continues he was prevailed upon to have it published first in nineteen thirty-five and then after ten reprintings clarke irwin of toronto brought it out as a true canadian classic   and the pictures fourteen in all from an early-thirties french movie   cosette leaning over a dying jean looks like greta garbo in golden ringlets   and the sewer  surely every young lover deserves to be carried from the fallen barricades of his revolution to safety through a filthy sewer  how could solomon cleaver squeeze victor hugo's gigantic story onto one hundred and nineteen book-sized pages   jean valjean's passage through the sewer shrinks from thirty-nine pages to six hundred and twenty-seven words  the final two chapters are transformed into a single verse from get this a scottish covenanters' hymn   how truly classic canadian   well paris france is a place but creighton is most certainly a place also   in late august nineteen fifty-two the trench had reached the western end of town cough and my fellow grunt and i were hand tunnelling a side branch of it under the sidewalk in front of the hotel directly beneath the ladies and escort sign  and those of you who are old enough to know what that means in the in the history of alberta drinking   we are tunnelling this little side branch of the main tunnel  cough   we took turns  one lying on his back and loosening the and falling   and pulling back a short spadeful of earth while the other used a long shovel to throw it up onto street level   at the moment of crisis i could see only my i could see at my feet only my friend's head sprinkled with red clay and talking  talking low german as he had all afternoon  me intense with listening   holy shit you buggars  how we ever gonna going to get this   fuckin fucking job done with that speed  it was the foreman   his bulging face tilted down at us maybe about to topple right into the ditch on top of us  but i was somewhere very far away  nineteen forty-four  i was watching refugees push their carts through the frozen mud of stalin's oppression surrounded by the german army's disastrous retreat across the endless devastating vistas of the ukrainian steppes  shut yourself i yelled up  you workin working so hard in the hotel every day gettin getting drunk   well after that we had nothing to do but drop our shovels right there  don't you move em them   and get out of that ditch and hoof it over to the office portable and pick up our last cheque   the foreman drove his pickup there to tell the bookkeeper and he sure as hell wasn't giving no smartassed little bastards a lift   so we walked east the entire length of main street all cut up with bumpy trenches and i felt stupid because my big mouth had gotten john  fired but he just laughed   he was two years older than i but his father had vanished long ago in stalin's siberia and he and his mother and younger siblings were true refugees working at everything to make a living  anything to make a living   he laughed and said school started in a week anyway  he was going to school and learn to be a good canadian just like me  well here it is nineteen ninety-one in a prairie town  it's uniquely its own place in the darkened summer sun  spread across the wide land dark trees and roofs surrounded by the white spray of irrigation sprinklers moving steadily across and around the fields  no more men in gumboots leaning on shovels opening up little ditches   welcome to treadwell best in the west   population five thousand two hundred and eighty   here and there among the bungalows the small old houses sit well below street level  the green rushes grow in the seepage along the main ditch  the giant cottonwoods still lean over its surprisingly clear water  pouring over falls between the same old timbers that might just might still record the scars of my boyhood knife   beautiful pastoral the air shining to the line of the rockies and the drift of snow on big chief that always that always  distant and holy mountain   no revolutionary barricades ever anywhere on these streets so it is perhaps unnecessary to seek that strange light in the treacherous filthy safety of sewers   at present the sewer almost realizes the ideal of what was understood in england by the world by the word   respectable   the filth comports itself properly   the filth comports itself decently   this is a very long letter my friend and i'm going to end it  but you're laughing  i know it because your imaginative nose has caught a wiff of what i've avoided in this story perhaps for the convenient benefit of alberta culture  but you're not thinking about my childhood preoccupation with outhouses either here so carefully wrapped around in the ultimate class of translated from the french and shaped into the marginal acceptability of decent sewers  no   you have caught a wiff of something much more intriguing and you're waiting  you're waiting  i am in that work crew busy beside that long ditch folded open out of the gravel street a lanky muscular kid naked from the waist up and so brown i must have been rolled in summer sunlight all summer and a girl is walking by  slender or sturdy   tall or tiny  long skirts or short skirts  that doesn't matter  nothing but age will stop the words that are sprayed from every mouth into the bright air   when an old woman walks by there is silence  not necessarily respectful but just silence  but for a girl words words   what are those words word-lover   why don't i write them down for you to read
