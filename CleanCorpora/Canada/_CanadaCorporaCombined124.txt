 it it and actually it's true though they're colours that really make you stop and go you know fall is here you know no more the   of the brighter colours  in terms of actual styles well there really isn't one style  fashion i mean i'm sure you've noticed this as well fashion's really changed   skirts aren't all you know one length everybody has the style that looks good on them  but there is one trend that we can look at uhm comfort  everybody wants to look good but if you're gonna   going to wear that outfit for twelve hours at work you also have to feel good and feel comfortable  you don't wanna want to be you know shifting the skirt and pulling the pants down and tucking the shirt in   so so loose and flowing were some of the words that were being used to describe this season  gee comfort what what a radical concept laugh   how bold laugh i'm i'm glad to hear that though that that the dictates are loosening up a bit  i mean it used to be that sort of uh skirts ankle length one week and then thigh high the next  so uh uh i'm i'm pleased certainly to hear that uh more variety's what's going on out there  that's there no one skirt length or one type of shoe  yeah and a lot of that has to do with with  women themselves saying you know stop  enough is enough  women who are looking and recognising what they do and they  more importantly do not look good in  and also women who wanna want to be comfortable in what they wear whether they're working or whether it's  it's you know for play on the weekend  in a sense fashion has become much more customer oriented and customer dictated than it was five or ten years ago  the fashion today is more uh geared to the consumer  she is very smart she knows exactly what she wants  and she's smart in the sense that she looks at her bod  speaker says 'bod' not 'body' and she says well i'm i'm  too short to wear very wide pants  so in my collection you'll see a series of wide pants and you'll see a series of narrower pants  and as far as lengths of skirt go you'll see both  you'll see very long at thirty-five inches and you'll see some short at twenty-one inches   i don't think you'll see much of the mini-micro   well we can all breathe a sigh of relief on that one  still what what's that talk of twenty-one inches  that sounds pretty micro to me  well it was funny cos i thought the same thing but it's  not as short as i thought  that actually falls to just barely above your knee  so it's it's quite respectable quite professional  now the other thing that's interesting is men's fashions continue to creep into women's wear  uhm you've probably got a few already  i mean very fast how many of your husband's or dad's sweaters or jackets have been hanging in your closet over the years  i tell you i'd be right back to grunge if i tried to wear my husband's sweat-   he's like six foot three six four so i'd i'd  be floating  it'd be like those pants you can fit three of your friends in  i'd look pretty ridiculous  well now you can go out and you can buy your own husband's clothing only you can call it a boyfriend   you can shop at the men's stores!   exactly  except you can actually buy men's clothing in the women's stores  oh hmmm  things like a boyfriend jacket a grandfather sweater which is one of those big baggy cardigans you know really nice and warm  homely   yes exactly but so nice in the winter when  it's cold   mm mmm   it's perfect for the woman with no man's closet to raid like  you and i  now every year we get the must-haves  those pieces of clothing that nobody should be without  you must have uhm a good blazer   okay if you're if you're working a lot in the office and things like that you should have at least one good semi-fitted blazer  you should have a good boxy blazer a boyfriend blazer for the weekends you know to wear with boots and stuff  you should have some really great sweaters  sweaters are good over jeans or good over leggings or good over several uhm types of pants you may have in your wardrobe so that's how you can mix that in  uhmm must-haves uh  some good bodysuits  one or two good bodysuits uh a good basic black one which is my colour  and uhm ah one of the colour of your choice  choice well that's good to hear after hearing you must have   laugh   i mean i think that that's a for people who don't have a whole lot of money or don't want to be ah told that they must have anything how much can you sort of recycle from year to year  i mean we are we safe going out  in in anything uhm that uh you know if you don't  wanna want to completely redo your wardrobe twice a year  uh can we sort of uhm carry on with what we've been wearing pretty  much or make it look a little different  well well yeah a lot of the things that  that angela buccarro was mentioning you know you must have a couple of sweaters well you can use last year's sweaters or the sweaters from a couple of years ago  jackets most of us have blazers of some sort lying in our closet or lying in a in a back closet somewhere so  you know it's it's not necessarily  necessary to go out and and completely rebuy things  uhm and and a lot of the designers like angela buccarro realize that that most of us you know we wanna want to buy a couple of new things  you know you wanna want to go into work in the fall with that one or two new items that make you feel great  but that doesn't mean going and buying a complete new laugh  wardrobe twice a year or three times a year or however many seasons we have  and especially for us with winter when we wear that  those clothing s here  yeah   so long   yeah well we don't have a three month winter it's seven months  laugh   well that's what i was gonna going to   say  this concept of like four different seasons in fashion doesn't work for me  i mean it's summer and then everything else  laugh exactly exactly welcome to montreal  welcome to quebec i guess  uhm no we we sort of talked a little bit angela and i about about how you can update your old wardrobe  because sometimes it's a case of taking old things and bringing them into the new  so she did have a few suggestions on how to make that old suit new again  supposing you have a black suit you know and you've always worn it with this particular shirt or or sweater  the idea is to go get a sweater that has some black in it  whether it's this stripe striped   example that's got some black charcoal and some white little uhm uhm hair sticking out or or fabric sticking out  that would be a good alternative  so find something to replace that  uhm and then try to to buy the colours that suit you best  and supposing you look really well or r look really good  in in uh black ah let's say different shades of greens and blues for example try to find the sweater that'll go  into your green  i mean it's nice to bring that sweater that you've got at home and go shopping and compare if the tones match   so the thing to do is maybe you might wanna want to add just some sweaters in this season  and that'll be your accessory instead of just a belt or  or just a pair of shoes  so go ge uh get some sweaters  keep your base pieces like maybe your pants or your blazer   maybe keep your blazer and replace your woven blazer  replace it with a knit pant and a knit sweater  well that's pretty down to earth advice  i must say that's that's pretty much how i function  i don't watch uh fashion that obsessively but you kinda  kind of can't resist going out and buying something new  to to not feel like you're wearing the same old thing all the time  maybe one little trendoid thing and then your staples and well you know your safe standards  those same suits that you've had for the past couple of years  yeah yeah   yeah   well that's good down to earth advice there  that was from montreal designer angela buccarro  she spoke with uh daybreak's marie mcdonald yesterday and uh marie's been in with us  thanks very much marie   you're welcome alana   our little fashion debrief laugh   it is now twenty-nine minutes past eight o'clock and uh in our final half hour here on daybreak we'll be looking at uhm plant therapy  it's seventeen minutes after uh six o'clock and uh oh  we're gonna going to get sued  it's time for the purse laugh uh first press review of this morning and and   sa sally sa  salvy is wincing  everybody's suing everybody this morning  there's the an andre arthur story  there is the uhm uh what the scientology church going on and uh there's there's a ruckus in c&ocircumflex;te-saint-luc as well with the mayor  well yes   it's a morning for lawsuits  boy i'll tell ya you   but the big one i think that everyone's gonna   going to be talking about this morning is lucien bouchard's uh  lawsuit   yes   it's a one point four million dollar lawsuit against andre arthur of and radio madure   he's the uh sort of well-known radio host known for  for shooting from the hip that's a that's for shooting from the hip all the time  he's from c k v l here in montreal yeah   uhm the uh suits say that uh statements made by arthur had invaded uh the privacy of bouchard and his wife caused moral damages and ruined their vacation uh uhm   and ruined their vacation   and ruined their vacation a-   uh according to the suit arthur uh said that uh audrey best had left bouchard and uh came back to him just before his leg was amputated for the sake of appearances and uh and for bouchard's reputation   on top of it all ruined their vacation   arthur uh apparently also said that bouchard was in a relationship with co corinne cote levesque the widow of rene levesque  now the exact wording of all this is in la presse   local newspaper you get sort of a paraphrase of it in   in uh the gazette this morning   yeah it's in all the papers right  that's right   i saw it in journal de montreal  and the gazette as well  arthur made this statement apparently three times at the end of june  and uh bouchard and best say that clears throat they've never considered separation and the suggestion of a liaison with uh cote levesque is false  in la presse arthur is quoted as saying that he has no regrets about what he said  and that in fact it was good radio   and uh   well that's always the ultimate thing for andre arthur right  and he's been sued before  this is old stuff for him  that's right  although one point four million dollars i think  is   i   as a lot of cash   he's he's t   sitting up and taking notice of this  uh he said in fact that he was just quoting frank magazine when he said this  uh that this story first appeared in frank and uh well frank   is ah well-known well-known to english canadians as  a kinda kind of a scandal sheet that comes out of ottawa  yeah   and he also said he'd like to see bouchard try and sue frank because sue frank is notoriously difficult for people to sue  that's right it reincorporates itself and so forth  yeah yeah   every month so it has uh a sort of a technique for getting away from this  the the big news in le devoir  local newspaper today is that the quebec government is getting ready to recognize same-sex couples  uhm it has apparently uh the government has   revived an interministerial committee that was looking into this for the liberals
