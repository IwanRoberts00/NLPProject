 she's talking about how her this  society that she's found is completely unbalanced how it's in a state of chaos and how there's turmoil and the best way to convey that is by making your images look funny as well as the text which tells you the story  but more effective is what you see through the eye and how it makes you feel  do uh does anybody agree or not agree or  do do do you see the point   okay  what about cyndi andrew's work the thai work   now remember she's a photojournalist   so did did you see any difference   in in how she uh puts her images together as  as opposed to uhm let's say fahmida bhabha's  cos they're p cos they're quite different   answer   that's true   if you were a journalist and and you were supposed to go out and take a shot of a crisis situation what would you want to get  what kind of have what would you want what would be the most important uhm aspect of the photograph you were going to take   thinking that you have to go through a roll of film and get it on an airplane or get it shipped out by satellite as fast as possible so it can go into the newspaper by the next morning or even by the end of that day   answer   action and movement okay   and what does that what is action and movement    information   you want to get as much information as possible into the fr into the frame   you want to be able to tell  you're there at at a huge disaster  it's an earthquake let's say   and you've only got maybe a  well you've got a load of film  like you've got a tonne of film  film is not an issue  but you know that your your art editor  back in canada can only use one picture and it's gotta  got to be the picture that has the most information that's telling  the most you possibly can about the degree of destruction the number of casualties the total horror of it all uhm maybe some kind of heroic rescue thing  there's some level of humanity and compassion all rolled into that  so you've got a whole lot of material that you've gotta  got to try to get into one shot  and i think if you look at the way she sets up her large image  it's kind of an i   and the word and the image  next to it the smaller one of the woman in the   in the shanty it kind of gives you the idea of how you go about  putting together that much information   how do you see how she constructs the the   large image   do you have any idea   answer   ya  answer continues   so what we've got is she 's has   this image here this person then there is this person and this person and right at the back there are people  so she really sets up for your eye  your eye is always going everywhere  it's seeing everything that's going on in here  because she kinds of gives you a  you go from this side of the frame to that side and back and forth  so you're really getting as much out of the frame as possible   also shot like this where she's trying to get as much information as possible  the work that the the policemen are doing  the uh street vendors that they are uh involved with   because what they're doing essentially is making sure that the carts don't aren't too much in the sidewalk and it's this whole issue of wh wh where  the road and the sidewalk and the market-area  and then plus the whole idea of just the traffic and the people and the congestion and everyone that's going into this uh bangkok market-area  so it's getting a whole lot  cos we see these photographs here are quite different again  what uhm what do you see about fahmida bhabha's photographs  i mean she's not packing as much information  cos it is a different  it's a different landscape too   but if you think about the gaza strip what's going on there   right now  gaza  is it somewhere you want to go for a holiday supposed audience response: not on recording   why not   answer   right  palestinians   it where uh one of the largest pales uh palestinian refugee camps is  uhm actually what this image talks about is how all of this area here is part of a palestinian refugee camp that's been bulldozed to make room for jewish settlements which are back here  and this is a palestinian woman who's just had her  community destroyed to make room for the encroaching settlements   but what i'm what was great was you said the word tension  do you find that there is an element of tension here in these images   what kind of   answer   uh huh  answer continues   mhh hmm mhh hmm   it there's something combative about her photographs i find  uhm everyone in these images seems very tense and very uhm sort of in your face  there's this kind of tension between people   uh even in the scene of of a wedding party  it's there's something frenetic about  there's something very tight and a little claustrophobic about it  like there's like it could explode into something different   it's not really uhm a relaxed fun kind of time  there's something very tight  everybody's very tight like every one's a little too tightly wound   does anybody have anything that they want to mention about anything they have seen   essentially what i wanted to what i want to point out and what i'm hoping you're going to come away with with this uhm sort of talk is how how to use images to convey meanings  uhm how do you  and this is something that you can use if you're doing art photography uhm as well as this style of uhm documenting and storytelling photography  and to to go in and look also uhm at work that people have done before you  uh photog photography   the history of photography and art history itself is really important because you can use it to your advantage and  makes make your own work uhm speak to things that someone else may have touched on but then you take it one step further  so it can it's always kind of interesting because essentially art comes from art photography comes from photography  it's the same thing  but it's interesting to see how you can twist it and make it your own   uhm if there's no other questions that's it for me   uhm thanks a lot for coming out   get's a's attention   sure  question   mhh hmm  question continues   okay  i realize  question continues   okay uhm i'll talk i'll use cyndi andrew  as uhm an example cos i workshopped with her so i talked to her a lot about how she went about doing her work   uhm categorically she never  if she's driving along a road then she always carries  if if she's on a shoot she has three cameras  if she's just going somewhere uh like out for dinner with her husband she's always got a little instamatic  she's always got a camera on herself somewhere uh cos if something happens she doesn't want to miss it  uhm but in one instance she was driving along  actually uhm not this particular photograph but it came at the same time that she did this particular photograph  she was driving along they were on the road somewhere and she saw uh some ah some kids playing by the side of the road and so they pulled over and she got out and she had her camera and   it's important to be able to speak some of the language of wherever it is you are  that's really important  now they always these women always  went with interpreters  and uh and if you're in this professionally you've always got an interpreter but you  you've got to know some of the language anyway  so she always comes up she introduces herself uh she asks them like what are you doing do you live near here are your family around dah dah dah dah dah  then she says i'm from canada and i'm a photographer and would it be alright for me to take your picture  some people will go ya great   other people will go no  and if someone says no you just don't take their picture  ever  uhm she said that you end up   as a woman you can sometimes get away with taking some shots  that you might not be allowed to take  as a man you can get really hurt  uhm you had to be careful  ah in one instance she took a photograph in india of a cremation uhm but only because she had been a woman was she allowed to get the shot  if she'd been a man they tape ends   one thing that is a constant whatever solution we decide on we all have to live together in montreal  french english ethics we have to live together  there is no choice in that  whatever solution you adopt has to come to that choice   now we've been faced so far with two solutions   one of them is what i call by shorthand the joe clark solution  that is give the separatists whatever they want   make them happy and that way they'll stop audience responds   now ya you gotta have got to admire joe because here's something that hasn't worked for twenty-five years and he still has faith  you gotta have got to admire him  but i don't have the slightest desire to follow him   the other choice we've been faced with is the choice offered by the separatists  that is to split canada off or split quebec off from the rest of canada  the trouble with that solution is that we are not all going to live together here very happily   in fact if the referendum had been won by fifty-one percent and if quebec had separated could you imagine what life would have been like in a place in which forty-nine percent of the people didn't want to be there   and precisely the same problem applies to partition   if you partition quebec if you say okay we feel differently we'll cut off this part of quebec what's wrong with that is you've recreated exactly the same problem the separatists have created   you've got a situation in which almost half the people of montreal wouldn't want to be here   so that doesn't work   i think there's another route to go   there's a  ah you know and and i want to caution you too as i say this do not assume that federation by itself would be a solution  that somehow if we could settle it all and stay united that would cure everything   it wouldn't  we've been a part of federation for the last thirty years  it doesn't strike me that we have been a very happy people as a result either french nor english  so we have to look at the problem a different way   and the way i want you to look at it is this   i want you to to think back to the bible the story of cain and abel the children of adam and eve  cain was a hunter   he had weapons   and abel was a farmer   he grew crops and raised animals   and cain killed abel   there's a lesson in that   in the early days our ancestors ran wild and presumably naked through the woods hunting and carried weapons but some of them learned how to grow crops and raise animals  and once they learned how to grow crops and raise animals they  had to settle in one place   that one place becomes the village   and the people in the village lived together in large groups first because they look after their crops and animals secondly because they have to cooperate with each other   but while they're living together like that in cooperation  they don't like strangers  and the reason they don't like them is because the wilderness is so full of our other ancestors  not my family  but still full of our other ancestors who are wild and hunted and had weapons and who were dangerous and who would try and break in and steal their animals and their crops
