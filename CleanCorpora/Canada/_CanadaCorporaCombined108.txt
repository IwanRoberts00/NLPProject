 so why don't we start with larry   do you have any additional comments uh to what you or   word   uhm well not not  much really  it was just in the end you uh mentioned that uh there should be a systems component in the uh uhh the systems component in our curriculum was important that there should be one and uhm i didn't see much uhh evidence of that being needed in here and i wondered if you had any comments on that   uh the uhm the the reason why  i'm i'm convinced and i i'm  convinced very strongly that there needs to be a systems component  that is emphasized in the program is because the the  the conversational models of the cree communities are  inherently intrinsically circular and th  this to me represents a kinda  kind of almost a quintessential cybernetic kind of  uhh model  we're dealing with uh feedback of of  huge variety where there are traditional control mechanisms  where there are uhm where there is at least uhh when you look below the surface there are a huge uhm variety of of  perceptions that need to be accommodated uh not according to a right-wrong black-white this-or-that kind of model which  it it uh which in my opinion is still fairly prevalent in many educational models where there seems to be often a right way as opposed to ah a wrong way  and and uh i i  think systems design helps people to   are you saying you did some kind of an informal systems model in your head about what you were encountering   yes  yes i did  because i was always ver very  uhm i was thinking about the uh i was trying very hard in that con context   in those contexts those six different contexts to think about the the forest without losing sight of the trees and vice versa  uhh to me systems design facilitates that kind of thinking which is macro-micro uh simultaneously  uh uhh such that i didn't want to simply focus on the boxes   filling in the boxes or on the other hand focusing on an abstract kind of global vision   mh hmm   both are important and i don't think it is possible to  to accommodate one without referring to the other  uh one acts as a check on the other  uh they go hand in hand  uh uhh th that's why i i'm i i feel very strongly about the systems design   maybe four words   right  okay   cos one particular uh feldman he said  that it didn't make his statement that uh uhm   ya   well my uhm only uh uh   well there was that technical comment i made before about  the document about where you have number of years uh in your   uhm in your uh histograms there uh that it should indicate that those are number of man-years  because quite often one thinks of number of years of training required as being one two three four five or something like that and then you see the sixty or seventy or a hundred and twenty it's a bit of a something  or other   mh hmm   mh hmm   mh hmm   and uhm uhh for the most part it seems much  nice clean relevant word  document but it it would be very nice if the in-depth interviews could stay in whatever form of the document uh is  is put on the shelf     cough   i gather many of your appendices can't  throat clearing   is that correct  well the the in-depth interviews uhm uh they could stay i i guess if i just delete the names uh maybe the names  and the communities   mh hmm     mh mh   because i found them very helpful in getting more perspective  on what   mh hmm   mh hmm   absolutely   partial comment   phrase   ya  ya  ya they were uh i found them quite exciting actually that people would would talk to me about those those kinds of things  we certainly don't need the names and/or the communities   word the two words   no no   word the names   phrase   mh hmm   mh hmm   but clearly a lot of the the  tabulated data here  ugh without uhh without leaving some locations it isn't very meaningful  and anyway it's it's the sort of thing that you can't really read without using some technique of analysis  so there there's not much   difference  mh hmm   mh hmm it's uhm  that would solve the dilemma i've been having too  it's is there's a lot of rich of course data that's useful to to  other students and uh and   laugh and professors  mh hmm   mh hmm   if we could judiciously perhaps uh cull this or  or perhaps just include a sampling  five or   ten uh that would reduce the size of the  the appendix uh  appendices word   mh hmm   mh hmm     yes ya   and then we could put the whole thing in  if that is allowable  i think it probably it probably  would be  maybe we could include one community but then we'll leave the name of the community   sure   so in in a sense   but you don't   one doesn't one doesn't need all the details  i mean all the these   pounds and pounds of forms filled in  ya   uh one one dummy form i mean  without without real names or something like that  would  be enough   for uh to give an idea of  word as a  sample   mh hmm   agreement   mh hmm   comment   just a sample exactly   agreement   which i thought was uhm but they are important because you've taken a uh an  unusual approach to the way you've tangled your interviews and incorporated them and so uh uhh it is important for you to have some conception of how you've tabulated that   mh hmm   okay  tina   word excuse me  comment   word two words laugh   oh laugh   i see  you said both   laugh   comment   comment     mh hmm lengthy question by extra-corpus speaker with a few interjections by others ( affirmations and clarifications). continues for 1m 45sec.   right right  i think that's there the list of of  seventeen of the of the total   co competencies thirty-five competencies   ya   partial comment   three words sentence continues  sentence continues   a few words   mh hmm   well this i found   t this i found u   useful   i do don't   uh this is m mcg mcgucken   i don't know mcgu mcgucken   clarification   i'm not sure if i or   comment     mcgeeghan there is it  clarification   mcgeeghan   clarification     what do you think   mcgeeghan would be  word know if i'm pronouncing it  properly     ya     uhm ya   of those of those  thirty-five the seventeen are ones she identifies as for the   uh those doing needs analysis  and uhm wh when i look  at this at this list i i i  think that this is a very this is very  useful this  it's a good inventory of of skills   that that people need  uh i found myself lacking somewhat in in  the business understanding because i i   am not and have never been an entrepreneur  and and entrepreneurship is one of those things i think people need to do in order to to to  get some kind of a handle on this because it's kind of   it's grassroots business  and i don't have that background  uh my computer competence is is very limited  it's an area that i need to to work on because i found that the the the shape of many reports now and the design of reports the planning of reports very much nowadays depends to a very large extent on on   the the abilities of the team members to produce documents in this in in this way  uh the the so it's no   i i think it the the   co computer the computer  technology is in a in a sense less of an extension of our ability uhh than it used to be  it is i th think   it seems to be very very much a part of who we are in terms of planning ah and designing analyzing implementing strategies and so on  and my computer competencies are lacking there  uhm   word sentence continues   sentence   sentence   sentence   mh hmm   uhm i would say uhm data reduction skill is is  is very important  uhm because as soon as we start to eliminate we could lose the richness  agreement   and it takes a certain skill to know not what to include but to know in a sense know what to   exclude  and that's i found is quite tricky  partial sentence   uhm the uh i think  intellectual versatility is uhm is very uh useful in this  uh it's very very important uhm because it it's   it creates an openness to whatever you  you're confronted with  it's uh to uh eliminate certain biases  uhm or if i can overuse that word mitigates against certain biases  uh uhm uhm performance observation skill i think is one thing that is under-represented in some of the things that we do  uhm i found i learned a lot by observing in in   in the context by watching how people operated with their with the hard copy material that they use with the technology that they use and how they interacted with each other   uh and that i tried to factor into into   the data production  uhm relationship building skill i think is in aboriginal context absolutely critical  if it's not there the the system shuts down and then you get yes/no answers to the questions uh or i don't know which is death to a needs assessment  all right  to to ask a question and two words say i don't know   that may be true of course but one doesn't want that answer too often  uhm   two words sentence continues   sentence   the question yes that that's  true  uhm uh uh and as i mentioned in earlier   i i tried to have a conversation and not an interview  uhm so that's all frequently i found myself diverging from my my task and i would talk about children  i would talk about weather  uhm uh i'd talk about some you know some   benign political event if there is such a thing uh that that  or something in the news  uh in a sense just if i thought that it was a way of building a relationship so that i could come back to the question  because it's uh i was very sensitive of the fact that people don't like to answer these kinds of questions  so i tried to build  i don't know if i succeeded  but i tried to build relationships however that's possible in a few minutes that i had with people  sentence   voiced pause   presentation of self really i guess was important  from what you said too  you're saying that the way you moved and the way that you  uh uh way you dressed  presumably also was something that blended in possibly  mh hmm   mh hmm   yes i was very conscious of of not  of trying not to be in a rush  uh that's uh uh that's very  imp important very important    now th th that's  difficult because there my time was constrained  i had to collect a lot of data in a short period of time  and of course that creates uh uhm uh a stressful situation being in a rush  so i found that i would get data whenever i could  so i would go out at ni night  i would plan the data collection so that i coud hit two or three people in a d&eacute;panneur at nine o'clock at night rather than during the day when band office was open but what would be closed closed at night  so i would try and catch people whenever i  whenever i could   need to be sort of be laid back about it  extremely laid back  it's absolutely absolutely essential in this context  to be uh to to be laid back   sentence   sentence   sentence   sentence   no it's not captured in this list  this is a discrete list of of of  competencies  uhm uhm i i i think uh uhm uh a sense of curiosity is extremely important in in  collecting data  just just for the heck of it  agreement   just to enjoy being curious uh to me is is   is important  uhm and and a lot falls out of that  agreement   uh being curious just naturally leads one to  to collect   okay  whether it's rocks or information it doesn't matter  it it i think it does lead a person to collect and uh uhh th that's very important  uh uhm i think it's also important  and i i don't wanna  want to sound too schmaltzy but i think it's important to love people period   agreement
