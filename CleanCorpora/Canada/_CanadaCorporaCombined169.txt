 yeah  is that a fair summary  very   so it's not quite accurate to say that  two or three words was fired   well i dunno don't know i had  to hand him off two or three words quite frankly  that that may well be so mister  roberts but can you agree with me there was a certain animosity between the organization and mister jones   yeah i guess tom tom was not happy with that   i don't agree with two or three words   and the number of decisions that came about rest of utterance   uhh   interruption from another speaker   utterance   well i i don't think it was unreasonable  tom tom advised people that he was uh not no longer gonna  going to be part of the organization and obviously people who   bought may have bought cos tom was  three words so if they rescinded i that's  not unreasonable   i think it i think it was a couple of days pause about 10 seconds   now i believe you indicated uhm two words  before the jury that you got the replies two or three words in a pretty old fashioned way paper shuffling and noises block rest of utterance   well we didn't think there would be as many interested  alright and at that point you testified that the  rest of utterance   thank you my lord   now doctor hubbard first of all i'd just like to uh be clear on uh what facts uh it is that you were relying on for the evidence that you word this morning when you described the various diagnoses of uh homer simpson   was i am i correct that you said that you were relying on your own interviews with him prior   it was he that gave you his background   that's correct  was there any other material that you usually record when you're doing your diagnostic evaluation   uhm there was uhm a single uhm notion that the social workers' report suggested that there was a fear of uhm   four or five words   that was something that he had told the the  social workers  social workers   and was there anything else that basically word  your one or two words   there wasn't any uh there wasn't really anything else   now i gather that uh from what you've told us that this was indeed the first time that you saw him it was maybe because   rest of utterance   that's correct  and it wasn't until the third time that you met with him that there was this aspect of a sort of forensic analysis uhm relevant to two words   that's right  and so that was uh how much time did you spend with him other than that  the interviews went an hour half an hour and one hour only  two or three words would have been rest of utterance   but i gather that just from what you've told us that it doesn't look like you've been asked for any other historical background information that you've been telling us about  that's right  and uh you were telling us that what wasn't  wasn't your evidence implying that that  one of the things you did was to rule out the ca like the idea of  word uhm with respect to the two words  i didn't necessarily say that i didn't rule that out  would it have been of interest that you were making that statement and determination of hypotheses two or three words   uhm the the thing is can i say that uh you've gotta got to be   two words scientific and i think that uh that's always one of the ways frankly that i use to to uh to   see and uh to collect information as much as possible  so three or four words you might be able to tell me your own observations about homer simpson 's days gone by and that you might have gotten how his history from his parents about  about word   i i gather that this word  phobia though is that with this particular phobia blood-injection-injury uhm phobia it usually i  it comes at a usual time  yes  so a prior history uh would be associated rest of utterance   utterance   and uh i gather as well that this uh this  this particular phobia is uh quite highly familial   what does that mean  that means it's akin to uh families  at this point there's no other sheer evidence that i know of anyway that one or two words families  see the reality of of all phobias is that this is highly learned behaviour   typically learned uhm via uhm from   the mother  now this this is cos of increased exposure to to three words  growing up   it can usually be learned from from  fathers as well it depends who you're exposed to   phobias as a rule are learned behaviours and can be learned from people like word who associate them with  suffering   now four or five words in that it is a  fatal response is loss of of uhm blood pressure is a typical response and that is the part that two or three words   and i gather if you had been able to take histories  of uhm some of the family members you might have been able to place out   whether or not uhh what those diagnoses   word   now how can this uh get you to tell us  i think what i'd ask you to do if you don't mind doctor hubbard  is to just tell us a bit of a bit more about amnesia  i would like the kinds of amnesia and just a word or two   thank you  uhm there are a significant uh word  of diagnoses that i two or three words and these two'll become evident amnesia  these types are all short-term  they there's global amnesia general amnesia and short-term amnesia  one time  okay  one one time localized amnesia then  two or three words   two or three words localized amnesia is that it tends to look like rest of utterance   and is it correct with localized amnesia that what you find  is is maybe some traumatic event has occurred like a person's been in a car accident or something like that   and and they lose a couple of hours or even a couple of days around the event  yes  and that that's what you  thought is that  uhm it i don't think  three or four words to the person  uhm memory actually is divided into the two the two aspects of memory  there's the active registration and the word  recall  uh registration is that part of the memory where memory is put   into into uh that part of the brain where it's retained  short-term memory is three or four words   the second part of memory is the two words is recall  uhh recall is two or three words active  and uhh when memory is going to do a long rest of utterance  so uh with localized amnesia you're saying that the memory  forms but the recall is what's affected  i don't think that we know that  two or three words  three or four words   two or three words   the problem is that if if the registration is wasn't two or three words then you weren't able to put it into memory then basically there wouldn't be anything to recall  uhm or perhaps there's because a disturbance is three or four words or whatever else  i don't think they you know  i sure don't uh i sure don't understand  now i gather that from when i what i   saw one who suffers uh localized amnesia that it may be the case   that that they know everything about that day that   word   possibly loud cough four or five words of course you know  but uh but  and what are the other possibilities i mean how   well how how complicated is it to get the memories back after you suffer local   localized amnesia  uhm   cos it's not   if it's not coming back at all how does two or three words   it's very uhm i think there for example would be  two or three words hit it with where a person has had uhm localized amnesia over a period of time uhm when he was drunk  if you start from that once uhm once  the trauma of an episode is over it's gone  it'll come back once the rest of utterance   can it can it can it come back within a couple of hours  it can  it then can it be said that that would be unusual could be 'uh usual'   uhm i it would  yes  uh and now is that what we're talking about with respect to homer simpson   sort of three or four words would it be an account of localized amnesia by your own standards   localized amnesia as i said can take place as far as ten uhm  three or four words and i would say that the top  layer indicates that the confusional description in the  interference on tape covers rest of utterance   and is there any aspect to to of  the ones described to you of those incidents that doesn't make sense and is there a three or four words   uhm  is there something about the word or the  two words that's unusual   i'm i'm not i don't think there's anything particularly useful about that  i'd say the classic uhm word of amnesia could take you know three or four uhm up to twelve months and even his loss has been external so it is variable  now i gather that what you're telling us that amnesia is  is a feature of when you're talking about four or five words  okay  uhh how does how does amnesia relate to behaviour at the at that time  well uhm i g i i i need   to picture my two or three words for instance  uhm indicates a blackout an alcoholic blackout  the the problem uhm with alcohol blackouts is that the person is intoxicated and is not able to lay down memories  they can still be functioning they can still be doing some things other people can word   so all kinds of people experience alcoholic blackouts  and and absolutely no recall of the   of the event  but their behaviour though will try to like   perhaps people who uhm are i dunno don't know maybe not aware of what was happening you know view it  as as as rest of utterance  but i i think that the direction that this is going is is is i think it's important for you to see is that the specific things the word the agility the panic attack the word attack and that is the more important thing three words the rest of it i think is  and i i i   we can get into that doctor uh hubbard but i  three or four words answer my question of amnesia  i mean is it not correct that that  the fact that someone doesn't remember what they they've  done doesn't mean that they won't two or three words   okay yes yes   so then later on word there's no way four or five words   can't you can't   two or three words   the fact that they no longer recall the  the time  something's telling me that two or three words  don't know anything about the level of functioning  no they don't pause about 10 seconds   now going through the uhh the  incidents that you rely on and i gather that loud throat clearing, shuffling papers covers about 8 seconds and uhm and they do describe too i gather uhh a sort of amnesia associated with that   the function including brain word    were you able to pick out a time  from what you had rest of utterance   it was uh he   i don't i don't recall what happened  you refer in your uh i was just referring to  your word of your report you said  amnesia amnesia can take hmm a break  i was just wondering if you know of a specific time point when word stops  it says the next two hours  so it it starts at uh  well i didn't i didn't uh i heard uh the people were uh going to be around  that wasn't something you had seen to uhm  i didn't no   and then uh the one other activity that you uh rely on is  three words where only one is obviously   yeah and and the reason  all we did is also was just  two or three words to express amnesia  at that point in time i i don't recall  i think that he just described sort of the intrusion up to the event uhm which one or two words a thirty to forty-five minute episode of amnesia two or three words  from the time of the event to the time of being in the hospital after being treated  okay  a and uh can you tell us uh doctor hubbard uhm did you inquire with him for more   for any more details about this particular incident than what he told  i didn't   i uh  i was relying on one or two words that uh  so i gather that what he told you was that uh he took  his foot up out of his boot and the skin had been hanging from his foot  on the foot yes   and then he put his foot back in his boot  uh did you inquire about where his sock was  i didn't  did it strike you at the time  did it did it just make sense to you  no i   two or three words   two or three words   cos he told me there was skin hanging from the foot i  assumed that the sock word   i see   but you didn't ask him about that   utterance   no i didn't think it was necessary   and uh i gather that uh you didn't have any kind of access to hospital records on that night   i i didn't  so i it's correct is it not that when three or four words to the hospital that they would've known about his two or three words   that's right   that was three or four words   and uhm i gather the other incident was uh  the other incident was rest of utterance  that's correct yeah  uhm and uh here i see i gather you described  a word amnesia three  yes   any comment on on on on what kind of amnesia that is that two words   well that was the name for an episode where the same type of response where there was an injury there was a time of  uhm of impaired memory impaired judgement
