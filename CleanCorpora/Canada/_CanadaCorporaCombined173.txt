 pair of skis  uh huh  well the first thing the first thing   i need to know is first of all what size do i need   because i'm not sure  well it depends what are you looking f like are you looking for skis or are you looking for boots or are you looking for everything   well okay i guess well i'll start with the skis  okay and we can look at the skis but i need to make  i need to be sure what length i'm supposed to get  mm hmm   uhm well you need  well first of all two or three words  consider have you been skiing for a long time  uhm i've been skiing   well how long have i been skiing i dunno don't know since well since i was a teenager so like eleven ten years i guess  and what what level do you consider yourself to be  would you say you'd be beginner intermediate advanced  uhm i would say intermediate  like i don't ski that often but i've been skiing and i'm pretty good you know like i've   mm   and i'm like daring you know i'm not like a wimpy  person one or two words but  and how much do you weigh  weigh  laugh starts secret question laugh ends   about a hundred and twenty  a hundred and twenty okay   the reason why the reason why i ask people why why how much they weigh  is we need to accomodate we need to be able to find the skier some  suitable skis for the knees of the skier  uh huh   why  two words length as well as weight because one thing that's important when you're looking for skiing for a good ski is uh you need your weight to be evenly distributed throughout the ski  two or three words because what happens is you're not using the tip of your ski and then with that you lose a lot of grip on the ice and you word you're not  getting enough of the ski  your legs are more balanced on the ski there than using maximum leverage on the ski and you gain more control  well wait a second i don't understand   depending on how much i weigh you put the  put  the binding in the right place  mm hmm   well it depends   no no it it's more it's more like   jerry's jerry's a  jerry's g a good skier right  jerry's around your height and weight  if you have somebody that's uh two hundred and twelve odd pounds for example you wanna want to put them on a ski that's a hundred a hundred and seventy-seven centimetres in length   because ideally we want the weight to be evenly distributed around the ski  mm hmm   mm hmm  the reason for this is what happens if the weight is too concentrated in the centre the person weighs too much for the ski the ski is not long enough what'll happen is that the person is not able the ski does not functioning to that person's ability  but what'll ha but you might   word cos there's uh there's not enough  word there's not enough weight distributed throughout the ski  okay drawn out   so what happens is so for example when people are on ice the ski will lose its grip  oh so that's so that's the whole point of having different length skis is   right  it varies according to your height and to your weight  and your weight  okay so it's both combined  cos yeah i always knew the height but i didn't know the weight  right  so don't aren't you gonna  going to ask me how tall i am or   well uh actually i can see how tall you are  utterance   oh take a guess how tall am i  i word   well you see that's the thing is that's why it's usually good to have a ski right there so i can line it up word   body   for a beginner skier we usually go head height   the intermediate skier you usually want between five and fifteen centimetres over your head  there's a word to five inches  right   and and then  basically advanced or expert skier you should uhm word  you give em them some advice      word   the word skier knows how long a ski they need by their own ability and how they can how they can  word their turns and they know whether a ski is too long for them or not  if they feel they can control it then it's not a problem to them  okay   that you know  one thing yeah that's one thing that's   a problem that usually happens when people   you know with kids the parents the parents  are always concerned about the length of the skis so sometimes they want it to be bigger and longer word  you know when they're growing  oh okay   they can keep the ski for a few years  oh yeah  speaker has short conversation with an extra-corpus speaker   that's not very professional  speaker finishes conversation with extra-corpus speaker  sorry uhm   ya as i was saying as i was saying basically uh   what the hell was i saying   you were talking about the length of the ski  uh the l uhm the h   you were talking about kids  like sometimes the parents want   right  like sometimes sometimes  the parents will want a longer ski so they don't have to buy them the next year   oh really  ya  so tha that sometimes happens but the thing is is really the safety of of  the skier is the first and foremost important thing to worry about  oh really   it's not always that important to go for the sale  it's really important to look for uh for  the important thing to to   a safe ski   you know ideally what you wanna want to   do is you wanna want to suit the skier  for their needs  like you wanna want to find them the right equipment so that what they're getting is uh something that's uh you know something that's uh something that's  gonna going to like suit their needs as a skier and not uh  you know something that they can use   cos it's no fun it's like if somebody goes out to buy a porsche  and uh they're sold a subaru they're not getting what they're looking for  right right   whereas if there's someone's looking for a subaru if they want a practical car for the weekends or climbing hills or just word basic needs they're not looking at a   sor sports car  right  so ideally what you wanna want to   do is you wanna want to suit the skier's needs  and you wanna want to give them the best possible product for their needs  okay   uhm do you need ski boots  ah one thing that we usually do is when we're suiting up a  we're outfitting ah a customer or a skier it's usually best to start with the boots because that's usually what takes the longest amount of time  yeah  ya  well i'll take a look at the boots but uh the truth is i already have a pair  you already have a pair  yeah  alright uhm   alright  look i i wouldn't mind just looking at the boots just to see what you have available just one or two words like it so  sure   you never know i might wanna want to   upgrade approximately 20 seconds of hubbub; no conversation; b is perhaps humming?   utterance   more extra-corpus conversation? uhm uhm  are these all second-hand or  no these are all new boots  okay these are all new  ya   so   and uhm basically in terms of price they range around from ninety-nine dollars uh word down  word but but   really they're from about ninety-nine dollars sorry  sist sixty-three dollars for a junior ski boot  right up to let's see here two or three words but uh  uh around two hundred dollars depending   oh really   and that's so yeah some of these prices have been marked down from uh about two seventy-five  so the savings are are you know quite quite uhm you know uh  significant  ya  how how come you guys have such  you know good prices  like why do you get a good deal  so what we do is we're liquidating all of our own equipment and all the old equipment for uh for  somebody else and uh  so it's worked out we get to make a profit off some of that money  you mean for some companies that haven't sold their equipment you're liquidating for them  exactly  oh okay   so this is where actually uh somebody three or four words thomas we liquidate his equipment and as we said we make some of the money off him and he makes some of the money off us   so   okay   i it's a good balance  yeah it's a good  absolutely there are things that it helps uh   yeah it works for both people and helps uh it helps us get  you know it helps us to make raise  money more so that we can compete on the circuit   i see  so basically you're making money for your ski team you get a  nice big deal and you're liquidating their stock so everybody's   mm hmm   exactly everybody everybody  benefits from that   okay  so what's the difference between these boots like uh i mean besides the price  besides the price okay   laugh   uhm  cos are these ones like one thirty these ones're two thirty so it's something  okay look a take these two what's the difference between them  well first of all the difference is there's  there's a little bit of a difference in the sense that this one was ah actually a woman's boot and this one's a men's boot  and   in terms of  okay   why uh why do men and women need different boots   well generally the thing is is that uh most of men's feet are a little bit word shaped a bit differently than women's feet to be a bit wider and uh to be a bit longer as well  most of the time most most men usually weigh a bit more than women and therefore they need a little bit stiffer boot  but ah each boot varies according to the ability of the skier  okay  for example this one here's a beginner boot  why is it a beginn ing boot like what  makes it word   well what makes it a beginner boot  well the thing is is when you're looking at a different  boot is you're looking at uh not so much career but   you're looking more at uh you're looking more in terms  of uh the flex of the boot uhm the stiffness of the boot rigidity  what kind of support it offers and whether it flexes a lot or they don't  see it all varies and when you have a beginner skier it's really important that they're able to bend their knees and to apply pressure to the skis in order to complete the turn  okay  and what's happened is uh if  what happens is if you put a beginner skier in an advanced boot   what happens is the boot's so stiff is that they're   gonna going to have a lot of problems turning the ski because they're not able to transfer pressure from the foot onto the ski  therefore and vice versa with an advanced skier if you have somebody who 're very heavy or very strong then that weight is gonna going to crush the boot and the boot will not control according to the weight   i'm sorry what their weight is gonna  going to crush the boot or because  their weight and their strength the weight word  the ski it varies right  it it it really depends  right  and in general when you have somebody who's a   like a more advanced skier you have someone who's a more advanced skier they tend to be a little bit more aggressive uhm  these are all important questions that we ask or we asked a skier before before outfitting them  word   okay  so what happens the reason why we ask so many questions sometimes people can become offended when we're asking   you know they become a little bit word why are you asking so many questions  but the only reason why is that that   you can best you know out out outfit  the needs of the skier to the best support word  mm   right  to their needs  right okay   that's why we ask so many questions  okay  but uhm  so this one's a beginner boot so that probably wouldn't be good for me   uhm no  but you see that's the other thing too is sometimes if you have an advanced if you have a if you have a beginner skier   who weighs you know three hundred and eighty pounds if you have  a you know ah a pleasantly plump  customer who ah who wants you know who would like to ski the in some ways you want   chances are that uh hi his  weight will most likely he'll need   a bit of a stiffer boot because he weighs a lot more and therefore he needs the support  mm   okay  so he 'll take a more advanced boot not because he's a good skier but because he's big  right  totally  you're not you're not gonna  going to sell him the top of the line boot because the thing is he's not gonna going to use that  but at the same time you wanna want to get something
