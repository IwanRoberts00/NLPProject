 it's as simple as that  and uhh applause i don't know   it's very easy  the ethics counsel is there and there there   is legislation  the members will have an occasion to interview him  he's a very competent person  he will give advice to the government  but as i said you know in final analysis final analysis it's the government who decides  and when we have a bad government like the tory government that you voted for before the last previous election or before you know that's the type of government that produces these like that  but that won't happen with the liberal government  you can be reassured applause   the honourable member for kindersley-lloydminster applause  mis mis mister speaker thank you mister speaker   we we're hoping that some of the clout that this ethics counsellor will have will prevent the liberal government following in the step footsteps of previous government  we're hoping   mister speaker the prime minister said this morning and i quote deals like the pearson airport deal must never be allowed to happen again and i concur  but mister speaker would the prime minister tell us will the ethics counsellor have power of intervention to stop deals such as the pearson when ethics issues arise  that's what he indicated to us this morning  the right honourable prime applause   the right honourable prime minister   if you conclude that the deal was made because of the lobbyists you know the counsellor will look at the lobby business and intervene  but at the end of the day any deals any contract by the government is made by the government  yeah yeah we cannot deny our responsibilities as government  and we've been in this government for eight months and the people are very pleased that that   you just made reference to that  it's not like it was before  why  it's because this government is committed to honesty and integrity in public eye  and the government is the one that will remain this way  and and uh if the ethics counsellor can help us you know it's why i appointed him to help us  but in the final analysis as i said this morning you know the government remains the government  we've been elected to make ah decisions and we're trying to get the best advice possible  and mister wilson is a man of some credibility that has done his job properly advising ministers over a long period of time  he is competent and we're very happy that he has accepted to face these new responsibilities  but his job is not to replace the government  the government will remain the government applause   the honourable member for kindersley-lloydminster  thank you mister speaker  and i appreciate the prime minister's answer because he's made it fairly clear i think in our minds that the hon   honourable the uh the new ethics counsellor does not have power of of intervention but his power lies in his ability to report to the public  so therefore uh this morning uh  pardon me  recently it was decided that a single annual report from the auditor general was not sufficient  and this morning the prime minister informed this house that the new ethics counsellor would report just once a year to parliament  mister speaker based on past performance and our history conflicts of interest and ethics may arise on a regular basis and certainly an annual report to parliament will not be sufficient  so my question mister speaker is can the prime minister explain how the ethics counsellor can effectively communicate to the public uh without a chance of political interference regarding the conduct of government if he is only required to file a report annually applause   the honourable minister of industry  mister speaker uhm i think the question that is being raised in terms of the ethics counsellor misses the point  what the honourable member should be noting is that at the present time there is no ethics counsellor and no reports have been filed  what this government has done is moved forward on the  commit commitment   i'm sorry  there's another question audience hubbub   what what this government has done today is moved forward on a number of important commitments that were contained in the red book liberal party platform commitments to  to uh fulfil the report of the uh standing committee of the house of commons from last june the commitment to appoint an ethics counsellor the commitment to give him investigatory powers the commitment to stop the contingency fees that were audience commotion polluting the government procurement process  these are important commitments  we have met them  they should be applauding us applause   the honourable member for yorkton-melville  thank you mister speaker  my question is for the minister of justice  on march fourteenth the minister said in the house and i'd like to quote i do not believe it is reasonable for anybody to interpret the term sexual orientation as it appears in the human rights legislation as including pedophiles   mister speaker whether child molesters are homosexual or heterosexual in their orientation they certainly are not reasonable  and mister speaker child abusers will find it entirely reasonable to launch a challenge to the criminal code on the basis of their sexual orientation if the term is not de defined  in the human rights act  my question  why is the minister so reluctant to define the term sexual orientation applause   the honourable parliamentary secretary  mister speaker i i want to say to the honourable member that the minister of justice is in no way reluctant to define the term sexual orientation but he himself has expressed the seriousness of this question in the relevant situations  it is going to require a good deal of study to deal with this and the m minister of justice is now in the middle of of of doing this study in the department  and we will have not only a a definition of sexual orientation but we will be able to bring forward to the house a a a program and a and and a uh and a policy which i think the house will approve applause   the honourable member for yorkton-melville  thank you  i appreciate that   and if the meaning of that term sexual orientation  is so clear and he referred to jurisprudence prev   previously as being the avenue by which he would have it be defined then i believe that government should take over should not shirk its responsibilities and it should define this because the minister said  i do not think matters of public policy should be determined in the courts   so i would like to put this question to the minister  why is he not willing to take that responsibility let that be discussed here and to define it properly in the legislation applause   the honourable parliamentary secretary   mister speaker the the minister of justice i think is has put before this house a record which would is is enviable as far  in in my opinion audience response   he he has brought forward legislation on on young offenders on sentencing uh ah amendments to the criminal code and the fact of the matter is if  if justice is going to be done laws must be framed properly  and uh not all of the amendments that we would like to see can be done at the same time  and the fact of the matter is reflection and due care must be given to the presentation and the formulation of these laws  and that is exactly what's going to be done   the honourable member for wild rose applause   extracorpus speaker   the honourable minister of health  mister speaker i must say that aids is a very serious uh epidemic and uh if we can save one life then we must do everything in our power  this particular booklet was put together especially for those communities at risk and there are times mister speaker when you have to call a spade a spade or people won't understand applause   the honourable member for wild rose  extracorpus speaker audience hubbub   order  order   order   i'm i'm sure the honourable member will want to put his supplementary  extracorpus speaker audience cheers   the honourable minister of health  mister speaker this information was certainly not put together for young children but these kinds of behaviours are extremely risky and those who do participate in these kinds of behaviours should have the kind of knowledge that they need to make sure they do not spread the h i v aids virus  applause   the honourable member for saint-denis  french, 15 seconds   can the parliamentary secretary tell us what concrete steps have the federal and provincial governments agreed to in their efforts to house canadians in need applause   your honourable parliamentary secretary  french, 5 seconds   agreement to remove and reduce duplication and overlap to harmonize the building codes in canada  they've completed consultations on environmental problems but most importantly mister speaker it was agreed to develop new partnerships to develop additional strategies to attack social housing to   french, 5 seconds audience laughter   to establish priority of need in each of the jurisdictions by the end of summer and to come forward with new concrete initiatives that they will develop from the savings and efficiencies that they have undertaken  it's a boon mister speaker for canadians who earn low income in remote small isolated rural and urban areas as well as for home owners and renters applause   the honourable member for fraser valley west  thank you mister speaker  mister speaker my question is for the minister of citizenship and immigration  september nineteen ninety-three mister speaker a young lady in my riding was raped by an illegal immigrant  i have in my possession a lengthy criminal record of that individual which reflects sex offences drunk driving theft and on and on it goes  my question for the minister is this  what system is in place to ensure that people like this are kicked out of canada and stay out of canada audience response   the honourable minister of immigration  mister speaker this government uh doesn't accept illegal immigrants as as much as uh this member or this party  and in fact tomorrow we will be tabling legislation in the house of commons to further strengthen the fact that those individuals who come here illegally those individuals who commit crimes against the very system and of justice and values that we believe in as canadians that those ammendments tomorrow will be in effort to further strengthen those who wish to abuse our laws will pay the price applause  the honourable uh member for fraser valley west   well mister speaker uh the minister's going to have a good opportunity today to uh just see how well he backs that up because this young lady agreed to drop the sexual assault charges on the condition on the condition this repeat offender was deported  and he was in november last year  now i find this chronic sex offender this failed refugee claimant is back in my community to appear by invitation by this minister's officials to appear at a second hearing to be allowed to stay in canada  audience grumbling   mister speaker my question is this to the minister  why is he even getting a hearing in the first place and why has the government reneged reneged on its promise to keep this criminal out of canada applause   the honourable minister of immigration  mister speaker i i audience grumbling   have you finished audience grumbling   mister speaker i don't i don't intend to engage on the floor of the house of commons on a on a  case where a the member has not given me advanced notice of the member's uh name uh or the case file  mister speaker the member may not wish audience grumbling   no no  mister speaker   mister speaker the member the member  may not wish to respect the legislation privacy legislation due process  what i what i what i say again to the honourable member is that no one on that side has a virtue or a monopoly on virtue about those cases that are abhorrent to all canadians  right   and i will certainly look at the case that the honourable member speaks about and that we tomorrow will be putting forward amendments with the aim mister speaker of making it very very clear that those in the minority who abuse will have those loopholes closed  and i hope that his party will look forward to a passage speedy for that piece of legislation applause   the honourable member for calgary northest applause   thank you mister speaker  my question is for the minister of citizenship and immigration further to the question raised by my colleague from fraser valley west  the minister in the past has told canadians that these are isolated cases the airplane airplane analogy as i call it
