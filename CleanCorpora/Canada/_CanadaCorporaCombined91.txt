should sniff i  dunno don't know   i dunno don't know if you   if you ever experienced  i'm not rowdy but   you know when you had a class full of people and like  everyone was like the teacher would ask a question and then everyone would be just like blank stares in front of them and like  oh yeah  you're like oh come on do i have to answer for all of you guys   long laugh   i was werr we were   in english class right and i told i   probly probably told you about this uh  clears throat miss walter who later became mrs. trent  i think the t students of the next year had to call her that or something   okay  and um anyway she was miss walter  swallow and her sister actually talked speaker says 'talked' not 'taught'  at school too  so uh so she wa ohh she was  just horrible too and uh
