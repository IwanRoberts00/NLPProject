 word didn't get hiking boots  i guess that he has hiking boots but i think he just got them last year  uhm because david does say that hiking boots make an enormous difference not slide on anything  you're doing well of course most of your travelling is not done on the ground so it's not like your feet are going to ache because they're walking you know   on uneven terrain hours and hours on end   they were gonna going to   do have some very long portages   it's it's incredible that they're  even   i know   the size of the packs are uh you know almost bigger than you are  they're there from the top of your head to word  below your you know bum and uhm and then have to carry those canoes  amazing  how would you like to do it linda   i would  i would love to do that   i don't think i'd have the stamina   well well maybe if you're word    word   i couldn't do it for two weeks  i can't carry things  no no i don't know whether i could carry a canoe  i'd like to know i'd like to learn how to do that    but i uhm i guess with somebody else i could for a certain distance carry a canoe  right   it's not that uncomfortable once you get it up over your head  you can rest it on your shoulders  right  i don't know   i guess   could you see you and you and i doing it  oh no  you'd have to be have to be  word   you'd have to be all of equal height  ya  i think some of the trippers actually do a bit of the portaging by themselves they they bring it to the other end and they come back to help the kids with their packs   i see   but some of the portages can be an hour long   oh wow  mhhm word

they grew up in the second family or the first family they've always had jewish uh passover  right  it's not a new thing for them the   the american word   no   i was going to say you did a nice thing for them to be exposed  to yet another way to celebrate this season but they've  always done it that way  right  they've always done it because of ian's parents  ya  word told me last night oh i don't want to go alone  her sister doesn't count of course  phrase   she came and gave us all a big hug  we were all in the centre and she gave us all a hug  how word about it   ya but you know what riding her surrogate family  phrase in her life without even really thinking that you do that we are   phrase   she didn't phrase   and it was kind of oh bye   i know   i didn't see her quite catched word  on that one   quite sure   poor little word   aw certainly doesn't have it easy  no no  should be a little word when she grows up  i think she's got good coping skills i really do  ya   ya i really do and one of them is her sense of humour which is phenomenal  oh really  oh and a brat  she's a brat  but can get away with it this is nice  laugh   laugh   it's just a wee bit tired  laugh   laugh crashing noise on tape   i don't know what that's from  laugh   laugh uhm  i'll just put that over here  i'll have to take katy and go up to the general  phrase the only place to park but i'll just run in and drop her word   can you do can you drive that  word yourself  mhhm  that's not does that not bother you   have you ever done that before  mhm i've done it  no not really  now phrase that  phrase   oh i wrote that's amazing  of course i support it's it's no different really than uh dennis phrase    dennis phrase   i wish that i had thought of it  i would have brought the tubes home and done em   them in the morning and taken them to work  oh ya oh ya  i just operate like that you know  that ah  word suppose it's less intimidating for her to go in there with you and have you do it in a way  i'll just take it in to my clinic  yes  i could bring the the  bloods the deer home but then i have to take them back because i'm not going into work  anyway i think i word it  and she ah maybe she's highly sugges  suggestable   you know you know because i said to her i can not have any there's my word you know  oh yes  you know  but she has been tired  two weeks ago operation on a sore throat and she uh spent all day sunday in bed reading a book  well she can do that if she has a good book anyway  sounds like someone else i know  mhhm just like me  ya  when uhm but last night she came home and she played rugby and she was   ya  she never finished her homework she sat around for six to get up to finish her math and just   how's her appetite   it's not bad it's not you know she's a funny eater anyway  mhhm mhhm mhhm mhhm  no headaches  h terrible headaches  sore throat  well she had a h headache   sore throat two weeks ago   you know that i have a headache today and i have  word right  mhhm   but she complains of headaches a lot  oh well then and recently  mhhm  well  three weeks  oh well that might be then something then i would think   phrase   phrase   uh alison i don't remember  i i really couldn't tell you for sure way back in grade three whether she had headaches  you see a lot of adolescents   a lot of adolescents have headaches  yes they do yes they do   the sore throat thing though i was going to say maybe it's not mono mononucleosis because dennis has just got over a virus and so have all his patients where he was surprised at  the the the length of time that the sore throat uhm  hung on yes  mhhm   took to   and he this morning i said how are you and he said my throat is finally gone and he had it on  uhhh friday saturday sunday monday tuesday and wednesday  sore throat  sore throat  that's unusual for your regular  for your regular word   right   and i was about to say to him you know you've never had mono but i i feel so   did he he didn't have strep  streptococcus, throat infection   phrase   i don't know whether he ever   sw swabbed i don't know that he ever swabbed his own throat i don't know that but uh it's a little bit unusual so i was going to say if katy had a sore throat  which could alert you to mono if she has a lot of fatigue too  but it might be just this other virus but the fact that it's combined with headaches might   terrible headaches   and that's not usual for her   she gets headaches but they're more frequent now and she's got black circles under her eyes which i attribute to ah unhealthy eating habits  oh i see   yawn uh uhha  i wish she'd eat a steak someday but you know she  phrase   putting a piece of meat in her mouth she'll probably vomit  well of course that's what happens when when  ah initially you become a vegetarian just for a trend   uhm uh for trendy reasons then uhm  she uhm then they then they   lose the the taste for meat  phrase find it repulsive  uhha   it's been a few years yes  she can't even look at uh if we put meat  i can see that i i can see how you'd become that way  well i would too uhm  what's that shopping centre out in west island the big one  what about fairview  no the the   the third one oh uh   you know the one i mean   ya i do   you really need to word uh   phrase what's ah  what's ah   march&eacute; west  march&eacute; west  and we went

i'm beginning to feel that way too   i just think i'd be way too isolated  ya i i said to name  i can't see our lives changing that much except we may have an apartment and go to the end of tape   do

of the uhh financial status in the in the country   ya  they really can't just they got  word bigger bills than i did because   they they're more realistic i think   ya  well i think and i think maybe

their   they're paying for their uhm uhh room and board and you know even they're out of residence and into the into the  house we're happy to pay for  that and they're getting the sense that oh isn't it wonderful to have my own place and then they and that's all over again and they're not doling out the rent  mhhm   mhhm   but then they're not
