 jose lopez portillo was the president of mexico from nineteen seventy-six to nineteen eighty-two   he ascended to his presidency on the wave of new petroleum discoveries and the opec oil bonanza  it seemed as if mexico was well on its way to achieving full economic development   so what happened   lopez portillo used mexico's oil to borrow additional capital in an ambitious plan to turn his nation from a third to a first world country  his strategy made sense initially   petroleum prices were expected to rise well into the eighties   commercial bankers in other countries were eager to lend money to mexico in an attempt to recycle the billions of petrol dollars that arab countries had placed on deposit with them   this lending strategy seemed to work well for the first years of portillo's term   huge investments were made in roads ports and heavy industry   the economy boomed and hundreds of thousands of new jobs were created   unprecedented spending occurred in areas such as health and education   the greater availability of wealth also translated into an astronomical increase in governmental waste and corruption   as the international playing field changed in nineteen eighty-one  mexico's heydays of success and overnight riches ground to a halt   oil prices began to fall in response to the collapse of the opec cartel and the economic recession in the united states and other industrialized countries   lopez portillo thinking that the price downturn was nothing but a temporary blip in an otherwise upward curve continued his ambitious spending   he replaced oil revenues with massive amounts of foreign borrowing  the bubble finally burst in nineteen eighty-two when the international banking community effectively cut mexico off   lopez portillo was unable to obtain enough money to service his government's existing debts   with his term drawing to a close and knowing that he would forever be remembered as the president who mortgaged the country to ruin he nationalized the mexican banking system   now the rationale for that was to stop the huge flight of capital that was occurring out of mexico  mexican bankers and industrialists had panicked and millions of dollars were sent to safety in the united states and europe   portillo's actions came too late however to stop the draining of millions of dollars from the national reserve   after portillo's term was over the new president on the block was de la madrid who was elected in nineteen eighty-two   initially de la madrid did not differ greatly from portillo in his ultimate vision for mexico   he too wanted to bring mexico within his term into the private club of the first world nations  economically though things went from bad to worse   at the beginning of his term mexico was still able to get forty dollars per barrel of oil on the international market   only four years later that price would plummet to ten dollars per barrel   facing an eighty-five billion dollar debt de la madrid imposed harsh austerity measures  imports were cut   the public sector was slashed   government-owned corporations were privatized and government subsidies to all groups were reduced   by nineteen eighty-five mexican officials decided that this i m f style of reform wasn't working  instead the country would have to become more outwardly focused  more competitive and more export-oriented   de la madrid moved quickly onto the fast track removing import licences reducing tariffs and courting foreign investors  one of his major decentralization move moves  focused on the northern border region the maquiladora area  approximately three hundred plants were owned by u s companies at that time   the maquiladora factories employed more than forty thousand mexican workers and produced five hundred millions dollars worth of goods annually   this area alone didn't make much of an impact in the economic equation though   because in nineteen eighty-five interest payments alone came to a staggering fourteen billion dollars more than fifty-five percent of the country's export earnings   with the implementation of economic reforms the gap between the very poor and the very rich grew exponentially  by the mid-eighties for every hundred pesos that a poor mexican was earning two thousand pesos would be pocketed by a rich mexican  the funds that had been channeled towards social programs during lopez portillo's reign all but dried up   even though both the middle and upper classes had grown substantially since the turn of the century the poorest element of society still constituted the largest percentage of the total population   since the nineteen thirties peasants have been migrating to urban areas in ever increasing numbers and this movement has exploded since the early eighties  this migratory flood hasn't been adequately planned for by government pundits and the strain that's been put on the public services  has created a permanent underclass living at the bottom level of urban society  the informal work sector has been flooded by people of all ages  who try to scratch out a living polishing shoes selling newspapers or any number of cheap goods in the street   urban dwellers who have traditionally been seen by the mexican government as potential sources of political instability have traditionally had their basic food stuffs subsidized   beans flour and tortillas as well as commodities such as gas public transportation and electricity had all been covered  the de la madrid administration decided that it could no longer afford the scale of subsidies so a harsh blow was dealt to the urban poor  tensions are likely to increase as more mexicans continue to flood from politically isolated rural settings to urban ones  with greater access to information on politics and governmental mismanagement fertile ground exists for popular political organization  a prime example of urban discontent was seen immediately following the earthquake which devastated mexico city in nineteen eighty-five  the government was painfully slow in the area of reconstruction and so non-governmental groups mobilized and completed the work largely through their own efforts   by nineteen eighty-seven the austerity measures and the tightening of the mexican economic belt on the part of the private sector  resulted in an unemployment rate of eighteen percent   another twenty-five to thirty-five percent of the population was underemployed in jobs that barely provided for their basic needs  between nineteen eighty-two and nineteen eighty-seven real minimum wages fell about forty-two percent and the could be very fast 'there were' record inflation rates  the only group that wasn't left scarred by the abysmal economic situation was the very wealthy   until nineteen eighty-eight the governing party the institutional revolutionary party or the p r i had been able to deflect the blame for the poor economic performance on others the church greedy corrupt bureaucrats and money-grubbing foreigners   the p r i has been called the best hidden dictatorship in the world  it's retained exclusive power for the last seventy-odd years  and has proved itself remarkably adept until recently at adapting to whatever political crisis may be thrown its way   the governing p r i has been able to survive until now because of its rather octopus-like structure  its political tentacles have reached into all sectors of society  from labour to big business   in the past the regime proved itself capable of responding to serious threats to its authority by enacting reforms that undercut popular resentment   widespread agrarian reforms in the early part of the century  were probably the best example of this undercutting   the land reforms were reduced   peasant discontent and land pressures at the same time  such a modern day panacea is not forthcoming however   popular resentment came to a head in the nineteen eighty-eight national elections as support for the p r i for the first time ever  declined sharply   the revolutionary nationalist image that was seventy years in the making for p r i governments is beginning to look a bit shoddy   one of the principal continuous platforms of the p r i has been that mexico must be politically sovereign   the giving up of national economic sovereignty to foreign adjustors primarily americans does not fit well with mexican public  they see that it is not just the domestic market that is under siege but mexican foreign policy as well   an outstanding example of mexico's loss of integrity was seen in their dealings with central america   the american government demanded that mexico cease and desist with all oil shipments to ortega's nicaragua   they were also strongly advised to back off from any  involvement in the central american peace proposals which were hotly opposed by washington   mexico was and still is strongly affected by the wishes of its creditors  it rapidly kowtowed to the de demands  of the reagan administration dealing a blow to its already shaken international image   perhaps even more damaging than the perceived loss of external political sovereignty has been the breakdown of traditional shock-absorbing groups within mexico   the p r i in its octopus form through coercion or co-option  had given an institutional voice to labour the peasantry and the popular sector   these three groups had guaranteed access to participate in the decision-making that affected their groups  however with the implementation of austerity measures the ability of these groups to negotiate and to find solutions to their  members' demands has been greatly reduced   the trade union confederations lost their ability to win benefits for union members   they were also unable to maintain wage and employment levels   as workers saw a rapid decline in their living standards and their inability to match their wages to rapidly rising prices discontent has grown  the p r i corporate octopus is crumbling   as disillusionment with the p r i becomes widespread and individuals within mexican society begin to agitate new social movements have begun to emerge   for the most part they've been limited in their focus revolving oftentimes around a single specific interest   without the promise of benefits from the government these voices are no longer being incorporated into or silenced by the monolithic government structure   the decline of the institutional revolutionary party in mexico  is a result of the fact that it can no longer hand out the cookies and carrots that it has grown accustomed to   traditionally mexican politics were defined by who got the resources and benefits rather than by popular representation   now the p r i's actions are restricted by the economic handcuffs which it has assumed   the political crisis which is occurring now is a direct result  of political inability to control the economy   the increasing rich-poor gap the squeezing of austerity measures on those classes that can least bear them and the disintegration of traditional channels of communication between the p r i monolith and society have all given fuel to the political crisis   the economic bust after years of petrol plenty have meant that the p r i is no longer able to co-opt and assimilate dissenting voices   the economic crisis of the eighties has been the root cause of the present-day political crisis in the mexican system   unless the price of oil skyrockets again or platinum is found in copious amounts on mexican soil the morally and economically bankrupt mexican government will have difficulty stemming the tumultuous wave of change which is sure to come  for central america breaking the silence i'm anna smith   cabs 1-2  the demonstrators predict president carlos salinas will die in election year after stepping out of a cabinet meeting where he's told pollution is under control and yet chokes to death for lack of oxygen  i feel some days myself as if i could choke to death   today's paper says there was no thermal inversion yesterday so that means the air quality index today is unsatisfactory  the lead content is sixty percent above the accepted maximum  ozone is rated at one hundred and ninety that's just eleven points away from being considered dangerous   and there is always a permanent oily smell in the air   among foreigners anyway when greeting fellow countrymen the talk is never first of the weather as it often is in say the frigid climate of edmonton but rather the pollution  and apparently i've chosen a bad time to be here because the conditions are supposedly worse in the so-called winter which we're in now  environmental groups plan to hold rallies every month to force the government into some sort of action  the environmental groups want very radical steps  they wanna want to cut down on very severely on the use of cars in the inner city
