 ya  i was thinking s marjorie  and i were talking about her family the women in her family and how stingy they were  they were always judging criticizing people and uh i guess it really  had a a negative effect on marjorie   she int internalized   she said she internalized it all and  she really identified with her father too eh   it's funny  i think she was ashamed of her father in a way  oh ya   because he uhm he was a bit of a joker  he was uh not that refined in ways  and i think it really bugged her  uh i don't think anything really major happened  it's when she talks it's he's it's  it's his name that comes up  yup ya   ee that's uhm pretty interesting actually cos when i was uh in analysis i i always always spoke of my father  and my mother i just could never think of bringing her up  and uh my therapist who's quite sharp you know uh pointed that out to me  and uh it and it turned out that some of the biggest issues i had were with my mother and i just did not want to address them  and it was much easier to point the finger at my dad since he uhm cough i guess he was dysfunctional in a more overt way   laugh than my mother  uh it was just easier  ya   and also for women it's easier to point the finger at   the the guy  mhh hmm   ya   i was always closest to my mother   but i mean these days i'm talking about my dad cos he's the one that left  uh huh  but uh ya you know   but uh he was always pretty much in like a i wouldn't say like a like a negative influence or something  i mean not   i mean that story that i wrote is all about absent fathers  laugh   you know and the father's voice in there just vanishes  uhm cos he just really didn't know what to do  he didn't have any idea and wasn  wasn't   and and not only that but he just  couldn't make himself do stuff  i mean some things he just was not capable of  you know  so i'm not really angry about that  have you read the odyssey  not no   no  it's all about that  not the whole thing   it's all about uhm cough seeking out the lost father  the father is out on the sea and is lost is trying to find his  way back and is  okay   actually it's all an initiation into fatherhood for him  cos he leaves  he has a wife a son but i guess doesn't really know what the hell he's doing  right   you know what it's all about  and and he is tested along the road  and uh and becomes a father   i read i read a kid's version    okay   i read a kid's version   actually i may have had the whole thing read to m   me   my dad used to r read   one of the things my dad used to do that was great was from p probably nearly ten years  no seven or eight years  he used to read every night  hmm  i mean we started with treasure island or something and we ended up with i don't know vanity fair or n like  well just tons of  like i try and think of a list of all the books that he read and i can't  you know i mean i i constantly think of ones that i hadn't  or like all of the lord of the rings and  uh huh   and uh he used to be really into theatre  he's very wooden on stage these days   but he's got a good voice for reading  or he did anyways  he was a great reader  and so for years and years and years my my mom my mom would go sleep on go to sleep on the couch  we used to have pet rats   uhm lab rats  i had one of those   uh huh  we had a whole succession of them  albinos  ya and hooded rats  okay   uh huh  cos my dad used to work  ah he brought them home from the lab  the first ones he brought home from the lab once  and uhm and i'd sit in his lap in that chair over there  which is why i have that chair   uhm and he'd read  and my sis sister   my mom would go to sleep and my sister would sit on this couch  uhm uh and take the rats out of the cage and they'd be on her lap and then by the end of the night they'd have to be fished out from back of the couch laugh   cos it was it was a sofa bed and so it had all these real cool spaces to hide in the back  laugh   oh ya laugh   you know to be fished out at the end of the night   at one point laugh at one point we had an electric blanket which ceased to work  laugh   and it got sent back under warranty to be fixed  and laugh   ohh oh laugh   anyways they sent it back  i don't know if they ever repaired it or not  but they they said they weren't  gonna going to pay  it was the warranty was void because it  appeared to have been chewed by a small rodent  laugh   laugh   that's cute   ya   that's kinda kinda of   unusual having a rat  well people had them   ya  at least the   my dad used to joke that we'd tell the babysitters that they were burmese gerbils  oh   cos some of em them  would freak out  rats  but uh they were they were  just more fun and more clean than than   when i was punk i had a rat   we had a we had a ah i had a mouse named thins when i was really small  laugh   it eventually escaped  it was all nice too   uhm and my sister got given a hamster once for her birthday by a family that was moving away  and it wa was  happened to be about my sister's birthday so it was given to her  anyways  so there she was in her long dress sitting at the dinner table or at the at the table  you know with that hamster in her lap you know at the end of the birthday party or whatever  laugh   and along came one of the dogs  oh no laugh   laugh   and found this hamster and must have thought oh you shouldn't have  laugh   for me laugh   laugh   and so there was a crunch and that was the end of our poor hamster   really  the dog wasn't afraid  he usually would   of a hamster  uhh   the dog wasn't afraid laugh  of the hamster laugh   > laugh   the dog was right into it  the dog thought laugh this was a great idea   laugh   mhh a nice light snack laugh   a hamster oh great  this is a party laugh   you guys got hamsters laugh   these are way better than bones laugh   oh ya laugh   so that was the end of the hamster and uhm  so we got rats instead  laugh   rats would have the brains to freak out and run away   laugh   okay   a dog came along a large carnivore and started cruising along  cos you know the dogs used to hang out under the din  dining   we had a big dining room table  big   i i'm not going to herit  inherit   my sister is   but uh you know the dogs used to hang out there under meals at at meals and and you know and cruise along at lap level and  see what's happening and wait for things to come down and   and uh   laugh   anyways laugh   i i'd put my little rat   on the kitchen table for breakfast laugh   i was punk  oh  that's when i was working at foofoon laugh   oh ya   i'd be  i remember when when all the punks were walking around with rats on their shoulders  ya  laugh i worked for this one woman at this  antiquarian book store in toronto  she was really cool  she'd been a dog breeder and and and and   uhm she was just really into animals  uh huh  and she she used to raise these hungarian dogs called kouvases   huh  which were they looked like they looked like  a white three quarter scale wolfhound  okay  okay  mhh   uhm and they're i mean they were sheepherding dogs  but they're actually sheep-guarding dogs  okay they didn't they didn't herd worth a damn but they would chase away wolves  okay  okay  or they'd raise an alarm  anyways  but they're so they're very very independent laugh and pretty aggressive  anyway she liked that  she like that in a person laugh and she  liked that in a dog  ya ya ya laugh   laugh   anyways so she used to raise she used to   i mean these are the kind of dog they they could i mean they they're if if you were they they could you know  stand up on their hind legs and put their hands on your shoulders and look you in the eye  you know that kind of dog  right   uh i love those dogs  and uhm and uh one point uhm there was ahh  you know a a team of punks working at like  not like i wasn't one then either  working queen street  where one would come in with a rat and try and attract attention and two or three others would shoplift  uh huh   at one point uh you know one of these kids   came into the came into the store i was working at  and my boss said  ahh   you know and they just started heh heh look at my rat  and they were just making very overt gestures and  and uh she said i've seen rats before and if you don't get it out of here you're liab liable   laugh it's liable to get eaten laugh    laugh   but one time one time ally   ally that was her name  was was alone in the store and a bunch of other kids came in and started raising a ruckus  and anyways one of the dogs used to come   macca used to come to work with with  with them  and she'd spend her days sleeping under harry 's desk   at the bask at the back   uhm including laugh one time she slept through an armed robbery  laugh   but uhm but this time i guess ally  's voi voice raised her voice right  then the next thing they knew macca was out from behind the voice  woof laugh   laugh   and she had the store cleared laugh   laugh   but uh the robbery when harry was  when harry used to drink and he used to drink a bottle of vodka ev every almost every day  i guess every   he used to send me off to the liquor store everytime to buy four bottles of muscuskia and he'd just drink them in coffee all day long  uhh   and uhm but one day it was five o'clock  oof   it was the shift the day the changeover shift between the day staff and the night staff and i was  phone rings back there   hello okay okay phone conversation   they were back at the uhm at the back   the desk at the back and uhm so there was harry there and he tanked cos it was the end of the day and the day the day  person and the night person and macca 's asleep under the desk  oh and ally 's back there  harry was back downstairs  and and so there's three of them at the desk and harry comes up from downstairs and he's tanked and there's a kid there with a gun pointing at all three of them  and harry just sees this and so he horns in and  he laugh he says  he walks over sticks his hand on the guy's shoulder grabbed the gun and said we don't need any of that here and marched him out of the store laugh   laugh oh wow i love it i love it  arrival of new
