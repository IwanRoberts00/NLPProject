 all right this is a ski from rossignol  ya   it's a it's a it's a sporty ski  it's an advanced ski  it's word advanced  it's intermediate  excuse me cough   advanced  it's for the advanced intermediate skier  okay  okay  the uh s p s it's called the the   sport ski  what it is is basically an e two version of their  uh their uh ski word called the four s  the four s came out in eighty-eight  so uh it won many many olympic medals  okay   it's very highly regarded a good performance ski  very fun   hmm   it's a it's a very snappy ski  okay  uhm do you want to see here  do you want to hold that  it's very light   ya   okay  it's light  alright   maybe two word tonnes  of flexibility  okay  mm hmm  what type of skiing do you like to do  do you like to do uh do you like to do  short radius turns or long radius turns  do you like to ski moguls  well i like to do moguls but i'm not that great at them but i'm trying to do them like with shorter turns instead of making the big loops around like i'm trying  to cut them you know  mm hmm mm   right right right   mm hmm  so  so it seems to me as though you're looking for something that's a pretty quick turning ski something snappy something that's easily moveable  ya   ya that's it   okay   therefore when you're looking for something like that you're looking for something that's uh that's soft on the shovel  okay that's the front of the ski at the top  okay  okay  ya  oh ya that's pretty flexible   it flexes pretty easily   ya   so that way what happens is it's easy to initiate in turn  okay  it's easy to begin a turn and hold   and then what you want is something that's a little bit uh stiffer  in the in the tail okay in the back of the ski  something that's a little bit stiffer  that way you know that way what happens is it whips you out of your turns and it prepares you for your next turn  right   mm hmm   okay  okay usually that's generally the kind of word  ski you're going to look for for someone that's   ah for a skier who's looking for you know for to do  to do short radius turns  mm   but the reason for that is just that uh you know it's easy to begin the turn it's easy to come out of it and prepare the  word   and when you have somebody who's looking for a lot for a g s ski which also means giant slalom they're making bigger turns generally they have more even flex so you   a more more of an even flex to the skier  it slides   it's it's an equal flex and what that does is when they're connecting their turns they just go long and smoothly  they don't have to wo worry   about their weight about the changing of their weight  so much  okay   so it's uh you know it's  it's quite something  it's it's it's word   it's a great ski  it's super light  word too you're looking for something that's  torsionally stiff   okay  and this particular word okay is quite  it's quite torsional   what that means is bas basically    torsch   what's the word  torsion  torsion   okay   one ski is torsionally  it's sort of ah maybe two words adding an a l l y to the end of the words  most of a phrase that torsionally is stiff  okay that that that basically regulates the amount of torque that you have in a ski how much it  how much it rotates when you're carving your turn  okay  and so what happens is a ski that's more  that's ah stiffer torsionally means it's  gonna going to hold better on ice  right   that's the difference be  between that's one of the differences that you look at between like a beginner's ski and an advanced ski  right   you know how the advanced skis are   they generally tend to be more stiffer torsional  because they're applying more pressure on their ski and they  they're using more of their leg and so what's happening is they need something that's gonna going to   be strong and that's going to be holding up to the pressure and  the you know the weight that they put on their ski  mm hmm   okay  okay  therefore it's gonna going to hold better  okay and when you have a uh when you have   one of the word you know not as stiff torsionally generally what tends to happen is that the uh the  ski does not hold as well on ice  okay  and when you have a beginner's ski because they're not  i'll tell you what happens when they when they make their turns is as they're turning as they're turning they're not uhm they're not  putting as much pressure on they're not using the ski as much  that's generally what happens  and as they make the transition as they as their  skiing improves you know they the skier will make the turn from the tip of the ski all the way to the end  ya   as opposed to just in a certain area   as as opposed to using it more as opposed to pivoting the ski more  okay  generally what tends to happen is people tend to   tend to pivot their ski  so ju just moving your foot instead of the whole ski kinda kind of   exactly  that's ten tends   that's generally what happens sometimes when you have  when you have ah a beginner skier  whereas when you have an advanced skier they use something  something to uh to   word a little more  sure   they use the entire ski  okay  and therefore this one is fairly torsion word  so it's going to hold pretty well on the ice  ya   it's a light-weight ski  it's phrase/unclear>  you know it's good for doing short radius turns  and uh it's uh it's pretty stable at high speeds as far as you wanna want to look for   right   what do you mean stable at high speeds   well generally what happens is the ski doesn't chatter  what happens is when you're uh when you're when you're skiing is you go faster sometimes what happens if the skier if it if there's not enough weight in front of the ski we tend to find the skier move from left to right  they'll constantly move left to right like   like   oh binding   ya exactly  it'll be like word chatter  i had skis that did that  when i'd get going really fast it'd be like ah ah ah ah like that  like i'd be shaking  ya   see that's the thing is it's generally the way that skis   are are constructed  that's something that you're going to have to look for  so this has like shock absorbers or something laugh   is that what they have   well it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't  have shock absorbers  uh the floor actually does shock absorb  so i guess what they call the v a s it's vibration absorption system whereas this one does not have it  okay   okay  uhm can you excuse me one for one   minute   sure  i just want to check to make sure a few words  okay about 40 seconds without talking   sorry  it's okay   so uh i dunno don't know   like uh like i you know they look fine or whatever and they sound good but uh i just find them a bit expensive  mm hmm   you know it's like i don't   well   but that that's only the ski one ninety-five and then you've got the binding too   right the thing is right you can either spend  if you want i can i can i can i can  give you a ski for a hundred bucks and a binding for a hundred bucks but you know what you're gonna going to finish the ski  the ski is gonna going to lose its life in about uh a year or two years  mm hmm   and it'll feel great at first cos it's a new ski but what happens is because it will be receiving so much abuse  they're not designed that way they're not made to word  so  right   right   what about this section over here  is there anything there that  uh generally those skis are probably a little bit more   expensive  if you wanna want to take a look   no it's okay it's okay  if they're more expensive i don't know   do you are have all the skis you're  gonna going to be getting in second-hand are they all here already   they're all here already  oh  ya   our uh our deadline for bringing stuff in was tuesday however we did extend it an extra day  you did eh  mm hmm  what about poles  you have second-hand poles  no  you don't   why  cos they get bent  well   poles get get bent all the time  poles are not that expensive usually  generally poles it's not something that you usually buy second-hand  if you want to hand them down to somebody else you could  okay   i like this jacket   do you have a jacket  i have a ski jacket but i'm looking for like a winter jacket  mm hmm   are you looking for something more of like a parka type thing  as opposed to a ah as opposed to a bomber  a bomber is something that goes down to about your waist  like   nah i don't want a bomber   i like this coat  is this down  uhm i'll take a look here   yup it is down feathers two words   it's good  it's nice  i like it  mm hmm  it's nice eh   is this the regular price or is it marked down from this  uh it's marked down  it's usually priced at two nineteen ninety-five  this word is the word  i'll have to take a look over at this rack   and word   i'm not sure  actually i'll have to check on the number maybe two words conversation between b and extra-corpus speakers   so   so how much is this jacket  uhm this one here this is a maybe three words    this one model  which model is it  three one eight four   let me take a look here   no uh  so how much did i say it was   three one eight four you said and it's regularly two nineteen  uhh two nineteen ninety-five and right now it's selling for one sixty-nine ninety-five  would you say that's a good price  that's not bad   it's a pretty good price   like cheaper   it's all right   i like it   but do you think uh  you think you can get it at   do you get a lot of jackets   laugh   well cos i i want a coat but i need a  coat jacket that i can wear like to work you know  right  i don't think  i dunno don't know   could i wear that to work   uhm word maybe two words  maybe  or maybe if i got it in a more toned colour or something  conversation between b and extra-corpus speakers   what  well does that come in other colours or   ya i think these are some of the other colours  this one here is pretty nice   uh no that one's more of a bomber  that one's more of a bomber  i don't know if this one here is word  men's model or not  that looks kind of like a men's   what about these purple ones   oh that's a different jacket eh   ya that's a different jacket   so that i think it's word   okay   sure   kay okay let's talk about some  stuff that's coming up in the next three weeks four weeks  ya  oh my lord   laugh   i wrecked this book  what's happening with potage l&eacute;gume   uhh i have to call raj today  and i have to go to prairie des poivrons with him   next week   ya   they're still there   ya  i thought he picked them up  no   exasperated breath   that's what he told me on sunday  so next week  so next week uhh it still won't be there   no it's off off off off   it's off until two words   until we get the cubes  yup   okay   so that's okay   so i'll write that out
