 yeah so i just got a message from my professor uhm on  the answering machine saying that uh he's gonna < going to ask me to do some research this summer  which would be fun  and last time i i did research for him  a summer ago on uhm south africa  i did a little bit on south africa and i did some a  literature review on uh canadian politics  and recently actually while i was working with uh james teed  he asked me uh uh to do something on uh harold innes  do you know who harold innes is  yes i do  so uhm maybe he wants to go back to that  so  wow   yeah   this is you political spec uh this is your political   word   he wants to do uh you think he might want to do research on harold innes  yeah well he wrote on it before amd then he went to europe so i imagine you can't do research on innes while you're in europe so he may want to come back to that  well there is uhm   i was just reading a newsletter from this uhm the  canadian historical association  and someone has mentioned in passing to this uh renewal of interest in harold innes  and i was kind of surprised because uhm uh sort of in the field of my particular specialization uh innis is just someone who is wrong  laugh   laugh you know uh or wasn't uhm  staple word   no not so much the st staple   well in part for me is the way he uses staple food to describe the economy of france but also the way he applied it to the fur trade   in his book the fur  trade   mhhm   mhhm   it's just very uhm is still read and still worth reading but  uhm he missed a lot of what was going on #so i guess i just don't know why people uhm find him   i i guess i don't even know much about innes anyways  i've only i've only uhm heard of his work after uh after the conquest and after  probably even after confederation to explain the differences between the ontario and the qu&eacute;bec economies  uh huh  and uhm so that's so it seems kind of interesting from my perspective  and and probably to tell you the truth i bet my prof who's interested in him is partly interested because uh  guinness offers a way of explaining qu&eacute;bec's uhm  inequality the inequality of qu&eacute;bec's economy in a way that  isn't isn't negative to uh a qu&eacute;bec nationalist perspective  because it kind of blames everything on uh natural resources and  not doesn't put any on the culture  so uhm that's probably one of the reasons that he's interested   in in innes  hmm  so  so uh let's talk the bucks laugh   laugh   i mean it uh i'm doing research for a prof uh in my department  and uhm fortunately that research is not  it's really just finding a bunch of documents  and it's not it's not it doesn't take me away from my research because uhm i'm i would be looking in the same uh archival series anyway so that  so when i'm looking for documents for myself  and i find something for her  it's fine   uh huh   uh huh   but uhm we we haven't really discussed money or anything uh  i i i suspect that it's only going to be like eleven bucks an hour  well this is what yeah this is the  kind of ballpark that that this other prof mentioned uh sort of  i uh she said keep track of your hours and you know uh we'll figure out uhm  and i said well what is what is it about what is it   what is a research assistant paid approximately per hour and uh  she thought it was something like twelve so  she said twelve  yeah  but again she words   words sure she just told you to keep track of your hours and then tell her at the end  yeah  that would be good actually for me  do you think it would be dishonest to continue to   laugh   yes yes   yeah  i wouldn't lose any sleep   uhm yes  hmm that would be like   because you know what i could do  yes  laugh   but you know uhm because i i saw someone  it's uh i it's it's uh not so much a matter of honesty it's a matter of just uhm uhm uhm covering your butt  i mean uhh   well you know there there   will be t 4 forms canadian personal income tax form sent out  yeah but the thing is they don't know they don't know anything about if i if the   if the demand or if the requisition goes through  now michael don't judge me laugh   i won't   i mean if i were in your position i would be tempted too  but it's just that i mean you have you have to be careful because uh you know you could be running for office some day and say excuse me uh is the right honorable so and so uh laugh ever uh  multiple words   laugh   okay but uhm  yeah okay  i'm maybe you're not the best person to talk about this with laugh   but uh  hmm  the thing is it would be kind of easy because the uh i could just ask to calculate the number hours and then put in the requisition at the very end after i had maybe started to be a student at as uh in  in teacher's college so that then i wouldn't be collecting u i unemployment insurance anymore  in which case money  yeah anyway so you know i wouldn't do anything maybe   il illegal i guess it would still be illegal but  you just had  just check the fine print  i mean i'm not i don't believe that you know  you know that i'm not uhm i  to that extent i obey laws not because i believe them to be morally correct or anything but just because uh it saves uh uh it can save you from later hassles or whatever  you know for instance i've done something naughty  laugh you have  well i i didn't file a gee i  don't laugh   laugh   uhm uh this is uh i've become aware that uh if you're living in this province it's kind of an interesting situation because you have the federal income tax return and the provincial income tax return right  uh huh  and uhm to what i i wonder i really wonder to what extent the the two uh revenue departments uhm uh communicate like share   pretty much so i'm sure  you think so  yeah  it's one of the few areas of federalism in which there is great co-operation  oh laugh   because no  it's true it's true  so so the qu&eacute;bec government knows who files a federal income tax uh return in the province of qu&eacute;bec  you think they know that  the federal government  no the qu&eacute;bec government  for instance let's say someone filed a federal income tax return in an as a resident of qu&eacute;bec  uh huh  and so the federal government you know processes or whatever  but does then the qu&eacute;bec know  let's say the qu&eacute;bec qu&eacute;bec   government does not receive a return from that person  yeah but you've send both you send both returns to the same address  you send both returns to ottawa or to sudbury or  or whatever it is  it's it's sudbury for ontario i don't know what it is in qu&eacute;bec  you send the same you send the same     word regional offices uh   yeah you send probably here in montreal   you send the same form both the federal and the quebec one are sent to the same address  are they  yeah  and you pay one cheque  you write one cheque which includes both your federal and provincial taxes and then they the feds federals  transport that money to the province  that's the word   have you ever filled out a qu&eacute;bec income tax form  no  well no it's a completely separate form  it's a seperate form but you put it in the same envelope  in in london ontario you send it to sudbury  in in ontario ontario taxes  is is there's a section actually in the return for the calculation of ontario tax  not only income tax but also the individual surtax  and that is in the calc  calculation the final calculation   yeah you're right but in qu&eacute;bec there's two different forms  and you you can fill out the federal income tax  there's no reference to qu&eacute;bec provincial income tax   except as a except as a actual credit that you get because you you they assume you're paying some kind of qu&eacute;bec income   oh so you have to pay two different cheques for qu&eacute;bec  yes  you have to pay two different cheques and i'm sure the addresses are different as  well because uh the addresses with  to which the federal forms are sent are uhm sorta  sort of multiple words tax something uh  oh   oh okay   in fact that may be the one for qu&eacute;bec  oh i understand  so okay this is a special arrangement they have with qu&eacute;bec but i'm sure i'm still very sure that they  they keep track of uh that that's   one of the areas of great inter-provincial co-operation  certainly in ontario it would be because it's the same form you know as we saw  yeah   and they have to sorta sort of  split up the monies at some point  but in qu&eacute;bec you could the thing  could work quite seperately so  uh huh   so what will you uh what will you  have that multiple words   words laugh   i guess the i guess your point is that as a qu&eacute;bec resident in a sense the federal government gives you money in order to pay your qu&eacute;bec taxes because you get a   credit on your income  tax return  uh huh   uh huh   uh that may be uh that may be uh uh falsely presenting it simply because uh   but this is this is to the person  filling out the form this is what it looks like uhm especially if you're from ontario because in ontario you get to this point at the end of the income return where you have to pay more tax because it's the ontario right provincial tax  uh huh   and then you pay even more cos there's the individual  surtax   uh huh   like when you're filling out the federal return in qu&eacute;bec when you get to the same part of the form you  you get a credit in qu&eacute;bec which is based on your uh uhm the amount of federal tax that you pay  uh huh   uh huh  so if you're paying you know a thousand bucks of federal   tax you get with qu&eacute;bec's    you get this uh credit   uh huh   uh huh   uh huh   but then you pay a lot more in your tax to qu&eacute;bec  ah if you pay your tax to qu&eacute;bec laugh    ya laugh     word word     word word   inaudible exchange   well i'm sure that you you have to put resident of qu&eacute;bec where it says which in which province do you do you reside as of the thirty-first of december nineteen ninety-four   yes you do words that's right   words absolutely they're gonna  going to check that  but why would they care  well it's because they have a mutual interest in   in   yeah i guess so  it's interesting  in fact you know how the bible has different degrees of sin  then i would say your degree is much greater than mine   laugh   i'm not word   at least i wasn't doing it i'm just < unclear> words  laugh   laugh   no but it's interesting because uhm i haven't paid my debt either so  ya  uhm ya uhm uhh if you're if you're  receiving a cheque from a company in qu&eacute;bec you know it's pretty clear then that the trail of t 4 forms will lead back you know to  to the money you're making but uh if the  if the qu&eacute;bec government doesn't have any direct knowledge of the money you're making then you know  i think i get paid in cash anyway  or or if the money comes directly from the government in the form of a grant or something  they issue a t 4 for a grant  yes but not not not there's not accompanying there's no no there's no accompanying it's only a federal form there's no accompanying provincial form  see what i mean  oh
