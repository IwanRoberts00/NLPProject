 they were they were talking but   they were they weren't no longer talking no   okay well i think uh i'll get you to just look at the uh photograph word so that we can be clear  if you can tell us first of all uh where uhm  where was the cart that jane's cart   when she stopped  okay  if you turn it around and so the judge can see where you're   pointing   yeah   uhm actually uh the bottom of where the pavement is  where the pavement turns into gravel  and there   that's right  and my cart well frank's cart was in front and behind there was uh steve's and uh ro jackson's  cart  and that's we pulled on to the side between the two sides two carts   okay so   so jane stopped right on the path  jane stopped her cart on the path   yeah because these two  these two carts were basically right along the  the rope   okay  yeah  so uhm were they in front one in front of the other  you know   yeah   in a line  yeah  but off the path you're saying  yeah  pulled off on to the on to the  grass by the ropes you're saying  well not totally off the path but maybe two wheels were touching the path like you know  okay  enough for lots of room for  and who was first in line  my cart  frank the one that frank   and you were in   frank yeah   and then the next cart was mark and steve's   that's right yeah  how far apart were they one to the other   four or five feet  okay  and then the next one is word jane's  cart and right on the path  is that what you're saying  basically yeah two wheels on the path and two wheels on the grass  jane   yeah  you're saying that she pulled uh in a line uh with the three oth with the two other carts  yeah  so they were all in a line together  no no like there was mine mark and jane  's here  that's what i'm asking  okay  was hers over on to the more on to the   path  yeah yeah okay  how far back from the next cart up was her cart  basically in between  like this is ours and like because when i walked over i just went basically to my   cos my clubs were right here   so when you were ta when you were going and studying your clubs you were at you were at the first cart in line   is that right  that's right  okay  so when you when you went to go uh uhm talk to jane again where was frank   right by his cart  right by our cart there  so uhm had frank come up to you when you were at the cart  no  he basically didn't he was just there  after he talked to her he was still there  he was still where  right beside his cart  by his cart  by our cart sorry  well weren't you at your cart   i was behind our cart because our clubs the clubs are behind the cart  mm hmm  yeah  well uh i guess i'm not understanding what does  frank what is your evidence that when you were looking at your golf clubs that frank was over at jane 's  cart talking to her  uhm i'll i'll explain again here  alright  our my our cart was here her cart was here he was right beside his cart  he was close enough to make have a conversation with her there  uh huh where was mark and steve's cart  i thought that was two or three words   no this is hers this is ma uh  ours mark and frank's is right here  uh mark and steve's are right here   was she pulled up beside you say she pulled up beside the two carts so word   that's right   she was not behind them she was beside them  yeah beside them no   beside them yeah  so was she in between the two  that's right  okay alright   so frank hadn't moved but he was having a conversation with her from your cart  is that what you're saying  mm hmm  what part of your cart was he at then  on the side of his of our cart  on the driver's by the driver's  yeah the driver's side yeah cos he was driving  kay okay and you say that you were behind the cart looking at your golf clubs  that's right  and you're saying that you could not hear what they were saying to each other  i wasn't paying attention   i wasn't paying attention pause about ten seconds   and so where was mark and steve at that time   at their cart  what were they doing at their cart  they were either at their clubs or they were sitting in their cart  they were right by their cart i know  so everybody was in a fairly small area right  yeah yeah  within hearing distance of one another  yeah yeah should yeah  well is there something about it that would affect  uh would affect someone's ability to hear do you think  i didn't pay any attention so i didn't hear anything so  i didn't hear anything  okay   and uh tell me again why you went back and saw her   why did you go back to where she was  to find out what was going on uh  going on about what  i dunno don't know   they they were talking laughing so   i went i went along too and that's where she was standing  which side of the cart was she on  on the driver's side  okay and so which side of the cart were you on   i went to the driver's side  so you went from around behind the back of your cart   around the back of her cart   around to the driver's side  mm hmm   that's right   that's right   you say she was already out of her cart at that point  that's right  you didn't drag her out  no  okay cough   and uh did you find out what was going on  no  why not   cos i basically i don't  maybe i changed the subject when i said okay one more hug and   i that's when i made the comment of her behind  mm hmm  and uh why why were you wanting to give her one more hug pause about five seconds   i'm not sure i just i just did  so you pointed out uhm the quality of her bum to  to your friends  mm hmm  i was just being nice  okay  did they react in any way to what you had to say  didn't make anything of it like they kind of laughed  did they find it funny   no they oh okay whatever   so now as far as you're concerned uhm uh that's about all that happened  that's right  well what point was it that you uhm could smell her and tell her that she had a nice perfume on  that's the time when i uh gave her the last hug when i complimented her behind  so when were you when did you tell her about her perfume  was that before or after you commented on her rear end   uh probably before yeah  two or three words   before cos the last comment i said was uh   uh was the compliment of her behind  mm hmm pause five seconds   and so what happened  what's the very next thing that happened  i want you to be really clear if you can recall after you were hugging her and made the comment what's the very next thing that happened  i went back to my clubs she got in her cart said goodbye and she was on her way out and she waved this way as she was leaving away as she was going up the hill   so when you went back to your cart did you walk around behind  her cart  yeah  back over to where your cart was  that's right  and w and you went to what part of your cart  to my clubs which is behind of our cart  to the back   so you went to the back  that's right  frank was still where  beside our cart  and he was still by the cart and mark and steve  were still by their cart  yeah  everybody had was in the same position saw you had gone over and hugged jane and so on  yeah cos it took like five ten seconds all  four or five words   right so they had all remained in sight   yeah  now the point as she was driving away you say they were all in the same position and you had moved back  yeah yeah pause about fifteen seconds   so i gather that uh while you were concentrating  well i'll ask you what is it possible that   jane ran over someone's foot while you were concentrating on your clubs as you described   no she wasn't going anywhere  so that that couldn't have happened while you were there  is that what you're saying  is that your evidence  well i i didn't see  i didn't pay no attention so i don't know  i don't know  you don't know whether it happened or not  that's right i i   okay well what opportu what opportunity   to my knowledge   to my knowledge  okay well is there some period of time that you weren't paying attention that it could've happened  is that why you're not sure  well i was close enough i would've heard something cos  the cart is heavy enough on the foot that you would've felt it  so did it or did jane  drive over someone's foot or didn't she  no pause ten seconds   i gather that uh since this incident has happened you've had the opportunity to talk to your golfing partners  def definitely   and to discuss that day and how things went  definitely   cos it is it is a serious charge   okay no further questions i have for you end of cross examination   mister griffin you're known as zeus is that right  yeah  and uh when did you move into the river   word house  it'd be it's a matter of a week or two after i  spent two words   and when was that then word june  fourteenth   an exact date   i can't give you that  i'm not too sure if it uh  just gimme give me a time frame please pause about fifteen seconds   august some time in august  of ninety-five  yeah  you were friends with rick before that  uhh  at that time you weren't it for doing a lot of drinking and and drugs is that right  uh drinking uh two or three words i'd have to say yes  whenever you could get your hands on it you'd do it  at that time yeah   you're hangin' hanging  out with uh trevor jones as well  uh yeah   and was he part of the group in drugs and alcohol   well i really rest of utterance you know  i have this thing about minors drinking  alright you did drugs but not drink  yeah  alright you inject ritalin but not drink  uhh i've never seen it done word myself but   and you never really hung out with bart prior to spending time living at the river two words did you  not entirely no  so at at that september  twenty-ninth you kn you knew  bart for two or three weeks  i'd have to say a couple of well yeah about three weeks  two words   and uh arrangement within the house was everybody  kinda kind of just came and went and did their own thing  uhh well like well rest of utterance   but you could co   two or three words   sorry i didn't mean to cut you off  you you could come and go as you please though  yeah  nobody'd ever tell you what to do  no no  certainly bart wasn't telling you what to do  well i kinda kind of  rest of utterance   right  so smith wasn't telling you what to do  no  sorta sort of no   no leader was there  well not not two or three words i mean two or three words no  right  but in uhm organizing different things i'd have to say otherwise you know   like it wasn't my big i it wasn't my big idea to uh run up to the bathroom every hour or so you know and take a hit of ritalin you know it was like two words  you know trick of the trade anybody'd go in  there was a couple times i two or three words  but it was my idea to start off doing it cos i had a abundant supply of it coming in all the time you know  but you were the supplier for the house for the ritalin  weren't you  well i i was three or four words because somebody else was supplying bart and then four or five words   well yeah  you didn't manufacture the stuff within the house you were distributing  yeah pause about 10 seconds   uhm september twenty-ninth you went and purchased a forty of scotch  yeah   you went back to the house took the forty back  yeah utterance   the next okay   three or four words   and you started drinking the scotch is that  is that right  yeah  i understand you drank quite a bit of it  i did too
