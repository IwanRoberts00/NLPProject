 they'll probably hire one or two more teachers cos there are a certain number of students who have failed and and  there's that population who will exist in that volume  and it's really very much each cegep  uh to to find out you'll have to phone every cegep department head and say are you hiring how many  uh it's it's i know it doesn't sound like a lot of fun but that's really  the only way to find out for each cegep is to find out  what they need how many people they need   uhm montreal uh may need fewer teachers in some cases than uh outer lying regions because already more students took english in the first place when the departments were proportionately bigger in montreal than in other cegeps  so maybe in montreal a cegep well some cegeps may increase their department by a third whereas we're increasing by uh almost probably two thirds  there was there were eight of us before  we'll probably end up being twenty-four twenty-five english teachers  by the end of next year   question   uh  question   minimum  a b a a bachelor of arts   how's that   uh each again each cegep there's are a lot of things that each cegep can do and that's another one of them  each department uh sets its own selection committee and establishes its own criteria  uh for example one cegep could decide okay we're not taking anybody who doesn't have an m a in tesl  okay  and that's that's their privilege  if that's if they feel that they can do it i mean they can do it  uh if if they realize that they need seven teachers and there are only five available it wouldn't make a lot of sense  uh but uh that's  and the same thing for the le the years  of experience  uh last year our minimum was three years teaching experience putting all your experience together  if it totalled three years full-time fine  uh i think berbeau put their berbeau put theirs  at five years teaching experience  question   again that could be up to the cegep  they might say we want x number of years teaching in the cegep  which would not be an intelligent thing to do because it's been such a stagnant field for so long i mean there just aren't a lot of people out there  it could it could weigh in your favour during an interview for example  ah you might get higher up because you taught some courses in a cegep  uh that might play in your favour  but essentially the basic minimum is in a cegep you have to have b a in the field  and again the cegep could decide okay we want a b a in e s l  that's it  or other people might say we'll take a b a in e s l or maybe another second language uh and maybe translation and english lit   question   uhh b ed  question   depending on what  well it depends what you call a b ed  okay   and and that's that's  one of the problems  last year uh we advertised in the gazette in montreal and in the soleil in quebec city  uh we're also advertising again this year on april first this saturday uh in the gazette and soleil  uh we got four hundred and fifty c vs  uh probably two out of the people should never have bothered wasting a stamp because they had no experience of any  it was just uh here's an ad audience laughter   you know  but i mean it's understandable in today's economy  then we had to go through it and and  then we'd see degrees b ed and if it wasn't very clear what the person did in the b ed it we got a little frustrated sometimes and if it wasn't clear well if not that clear then well if not that pile over there   question   we were favouring a clear c v audience laughter   acquiesence   okay  becau because   no we didn't favour b ed over   no cos we simply we want someone with a bachelor's degree in the field of that is  applicable to teaching english as a second language  uh we didn't restrict it necessarily to english second language  if someone had a b a in french second language with the applicable experience in english second language and  we went through we went we read the c vs  it wasn't simply we looked at the degree and if it wasn't that we threw it we ditched it  it was if it was clear  sometimes people would put down uhh nineteen ninety-four nineteen ninety-five taught english at mcgill   well that's not a lot of help  was that five hours when someone was sick  was it uhh three three night courses for four semesters  was it one night course for one semester  uhm if you're preparing a c v make your experience clear enough so that when someone's reading it it says something to them  that that certainly is some advice that i can give to you word   i've read an awful lot of c vs  uhm so there are jobs out there yes  uh montreal generally seems to have hired not a lot of people last year  so i would presume uhm   i shouldn't name any cegeps  uh i was talking to a friend last night at one cegep in montreal who did not hire any english teachers last year but i know they are hiring this year  so i think more cegeps in montreal are hiring this year than they did in la in last year  but it really is uh phone up either the personnel department uh human resources in the cegep or phone the language department and find out who the the language department head is   and and ask are you hiring what's the procedure  i don't want to bother you but please tell me the procedure and i'll hang up fast   question   presumably that should work  response   ya  uh  question   how many cegeps are there  there are forty-seven in the province  in the montreal area there must twenty   so  uhm uh for sending them out uh what happens  i can only tell you what i do at our at our   cegep  question   if a c v comes to me i send it downstairs   uh if someone phones me uh i answer as much as i can  briefly  uh i tell them to send their c v down  uh and we've actually says it in the ad  any c v that we rec we received as of december first i think it is they're there   question   oh ya  it's not that we've we've thrown everything out and if you don't answer the ad tough   uhm we did decide to ditch what was before december first uh because there were there was we felt there were  a certain number of people that applied in the fall and may not be around and if they were still interested either they would reapply or see the ad or or something  s and and again each cegep may have their own pol policy   some cegeps uh may decide we have two hundred names in this file we're not advertising we're not advertising we don't want another file  especially in montreal  we don't want another five or six hundred  so a lot of cegeps you may not see an ad at all and you really   should contact them   tries to interupt   they may simply say hey we got tons of people here   question   ya  they should go through it ya  yes  question   i didn't even think of doing that  they're uhh discussion between a and multiple audience members   laugh one strange thing that i didn't know uh at all since i've been in this in this system for a long time is that when when these seven new  peop these seven new people we hired went down to human resources and got their experience evaluated so they  they could get paid according to the scale it turns out that that year of eighty-four eighty-three whatever it was when the  ministry of education did dirty things to teachers and  and uh  one of the effects of that law in addition to cutting salaries permanently by twenty percent uh and things was that nobody who teaches in a cegep gets experience for that year   they don't care if you taught seventy-five hundred hours at mcgill uh that year does not exist for experience at cegep  apparently  there you are  uh i can't tell you what the salary scale is because i don't know it by heart  uh you can con ask anybody who works in a cegep  they have a copy of the collective agreement  the salary scale is in there and it's the same for everybody across the province  there's no  except uh there are a couple of cegeps that get extra money because they live at the end of the world or work on boats or things like that  but uh generally the scale is there  it's based on two things  you're what's called an word   as judged by the ministry of education  uh they misjudged me but they don't believe it  uhm and then by your years of experience  and they take they go across the top okay we recognize seventeen years of schooling and you have eight years recognized of experience that's how much you get paid   question   uhm  clarifies stance   ya yup   the only thing that counts differently is what they call   exp&eacute;rience professionnel   for example if you taught a business english course at mcgill or in a cegep or somewhere where a student's got a credit for it and your friend taught exactly the same course you both used the same materials and they taught it uh somewhere else where it wasn't credited as a course  it would take them like about five times more of those hours to get the same experience credited as you would  so there is there are two levels of experience  actual teaching credited courses counts for a lot more than courses you may have done under other circumstances  but they have this whole file  you dump them with all your contracts and they've gotta  got to go through it   question   have some very clear english uh french language explanation of what you did   okay  uh if you simply said i taught e s l in asia for five years   they will they will simply say how many hours under what circumstances was it credited  question   no not that it's good but did you teach it to students who got a credit for taking it   that's where the game is played  okay  question   ya by ya   okay  uh  offers own perspective   okay and they presumed that since it's at a university it's credited  response audience laughter   i won't tell   alright the only reason i'm saying is cos i know at our school there are two teachers who have been teaching for ten years in different circumstances and one person got something like five years recognized and the other person got four   uh and the uhm it it   seldom happens but this year a stra  something strange   because we hired seven people at exactly the same time we have seven people who are on the same footing for what's called  anciennet&eacute; for their seniority  so uh now things will start playing oh you got six point four five eight and i've got six point three nine seven so you're ahead of me for whatever that means  whether it means in some cegeps it may mean   you get to choose your courses before i do  in some cases it may mean you  anyhow whatever it may mean  but uh sort of those extra four or five words mumbled in some point in your life word   question   none whatsoever   uh the selection committees uhh are  in the collective agreement uh there are five people in the selection committee  you may be surprised to be interviewed by five people but  uh but you will be in most cases  the five people in the selection committee are three teachers  uhh  so in our case it's department head which is me and two other teachers uh and then there are two people  one from human resources and one from the directeur des &eacute;tudes   okay  so they'll be five there are five people   that read through them  so essentially if you're sending it to a french language  institution uh it might make more sense in french because there are some of them that may not read english that well to look at it   question   clarifies question   uhh i've said this too i've said this too many times but it's a local decision  understands   uhm at our cegep what we decided to do once we got through a whole the c vs last we ended up with a list of ninety people uhh and we invited the ninety people to come for tests  there was a written test in french  there wa there were one two  three sections of a written assessment in english and there was an oral assessment in english   okay   so yes there was a french a  a written french requirement   question   yes  question   no it wasn't   uh actually it was uh the the test was part of the test was taken out since it was not  because people wouldn't be teaching in french  but we felt that since our institution is a french language institution one of the things that happens in our department also is that  uh people secretaries uhh one after the other so the person has to be able to function in french
