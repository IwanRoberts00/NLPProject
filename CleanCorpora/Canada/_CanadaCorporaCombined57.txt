 and her she had a brother that was really bright too  he's uh now a sheep farmer  laugh   he went to university and got his all his   degrees and then decided no not for him and  lives over in gambier island there i think  oh really   but like gambier or tuxedo or  one of the islands anyway  and uh raises sheep  two words very laid back  maybe four words   good for him  > but uh she decided that sylvie  decided that </}she was uh going to take languages and uh she specialized in uh mandarin  and uh speaks it fluently  ohh  ya  she is really an incredible girl  she tried getting married and living here for a while but uhm  didn't quite work out   no she wasn't happy with that  uhh her ex-husband uh was transferred over to a small community on vancouver island  so she decided no that wasn't for her  and uhm so then uh they split up and she had the opportunity of going to ah china   mhh   uhm a year's uhm contract  so she went over and just enjoyed it so much   that she signed on for uhm a  a word length of time  ya   mhh   for ever laugh   ya i was talkin talking to her dad just recently and he said no he said uh i don't think she'll ever move back home  she really loves it there   so i don't know what it's gonna going to   be like when it uh all comes under communist rule but   but she's not in in hong kong  she's in mainland china so  is it is it part of hong  like there's part of hong kong on the mainland called kowloon  but that's that's they speak cantonese  oh that may be   no  it's mandarin  mandarin ya   ya okay   i don't know  ya  i never thought to ask him  he he did say the name of the  the uh community she was living in but uh i wouldn't  ever be able to remember it laugh   you gotta have got to work on   chinese sometime laugh   ya right ya   uhh   ya   usually if it if it's  a japanese uh area i can i try and remember those areas  uh especially if i've looked it up on the map but uhm uh  china is uhm that's another kettle of fish altogether laugh   where else did you go in japan  well we uhm we stayed at ome  which is just north of uh tokyo  okay  and uhm then uh we spent some time in uh uh shinyokohama  which is uh uhm uhm part of some   part of yokohama   part yokohama ya   okay okay   and then went from there uhm we were in uhm kyoto for three days   and uh we were at uh uh uhh just between kyoto and yokohama at uhm   can't recall the name of the the  community  but they h have uhm  huge strawberry houses there  strawberry houses  strawberry houses in japan are different  they don't  like here when you know the strawberries ah  fiel field ah farmer you have huge  fields of strawberries right   right right right   but because of the uhm uh the landscape in japan you've got agriculture areas all down each side but the spine of japan is all mountainous right  right  and so they had to in order to have some uh agricultural area they have to utilize the  mountainous area/[>  right   and so what they've done is all up the hillside they've terraced up  right   and on each of these terraces they have like a dome shape uhh structure that probably is oh maybe half a block long and it's uh made with uhh wire uhm s uhh supports  and then like a plastic over top of it  okay   so that you could s uh sort  of semi stand up in these little houses  and uh within the house they have   it's almost like the cement abutments we have here  and they're they're four high  okay  and where these cement abutmen  abutments   you know how it'll go along flat and then it has a dip in it  mhh hmm  well this goes along flat for a short distance maybe six or eight inches and then there's a dip  and within that dip is where the soil is and the strawberry plants are there  and so they hang out from the cement   right   well the sun heats through that plastic  onto the cement  i see   the cement causes another excess   heat and so they ripen quite quickly  and their season goes from january to end of tape   by the way when uh when i was in uh rosthern ernie who in is interested in  history teaches  history took me to batoche  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh  have you been there  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   did you did you  see the the audio-visual presentation  word   ya  isn't it fantastic  well i saw most of it  something wasn't working with it but it was still very good  oh dear  oh dear   ya  and uh of course it was a gorgeous day  two words in june  ya ya   and they had a drought at that part of  the province whereas in calgary it was pouring  rain   ya ya   ya   but uhm i i really enjoy just walking along the north saskachewan river  and i want to canoe that  from edmonton to saskatoon some time   push push   ron ronald   and madeline took us took us   there     cough   mhh hmm  angelo and ian as you know  word we word   word younger   they were very impressed  and a couple a year or so ago  angelo did a school project ah an essay  on riel  and in fact wrote pages about the actual battle which was very  vivid in his mind from from the this show  ohh   ya   and he wasn't he was   sorta sort of shy about this so he  he put his you know his his  book sources down but he didn't actually say i was at batoche and saw this show  mhh hmm   and so the teacher was sort of taken aback by this  not " these" pages of description of the battle and felt probably that  angelo had lifted them from fiction  whereas angelo was remembering laugh you know   ya ya   we also have a couple of good sources  you know we bou we bought like  one of the brochures with battle plans and   stuff like that   mhh hmm   so he had he had  all of that   i want to go back cos we didn't have the time that day to really walk the whole battleground  you know we we saw the   the museum the presentation and made it to the church and the old house  ya   the old word   but uh we didn't have anymore time  see what was really neat was that uhm uh cindy was gone for the day and so uh ern   ernie and i ended up sitting up till about one o'clock at night talking about well exactly the conversation we had before talking about those books  mhh hmm   mhh hmm  and then the morning we went out to batoche  the amazing thing about is rosthern is  mhh hmm   we got out of the car and left and said aren't you  gonna going to at least close the door  and he says oh no it's hot today  laugh ya ya   nobody locks the door   laugh   we know about it   i know isn't it wonderful  have you've forgotten but how did how  how did you grow up   but that's what small town life was like for us   oh well we never had locks on the door at all  okay well we did have locks and my parents did lock up at night but we always left the keys in the car and so did everybody  ya   and you know why you that you   leave the keys in the car for the same reason   that was in case your neighbours suddenly needed to  borrow the car  and we did on at least one occasion look out and see our car backing out the driveway in a hurry  laugh   and it was our next door neighbours heading off to hospital  take taking somebody to the hospital in a hurry  they had four children  wow  so that was the reason for the keys in the car  ya  that i think might've been exceptional though jan   well but just to leave the keys in the car that  was standard  ya   well i remember earl mentioning when we came to guelph and i kinda kind of left i didn't lock the doors and and he commented about that  he said you know you're you're  in guelph here and uh    lock your laugh   word here word  in light of it   ya   ya   well we have we we  have to tell  laugh   they have taken to they leave their   apartment door open all the time because uh dan hasn't been able to sort of make it to the right buttons to let people in  ya   and so if he's there by by  himself  so a great deal of the time they leave the apartment door open  it's been a problem of of   a do doctor their doctor being able to get in     mhh hmm     mhh hmm   this is this is  difficult   they have the telephone they're talking on the telephone and the door buzzer works through the telephone   and and and so   oh i see   but uh and he also they hid   a key on the roof of their building  and mom and i went and looked and couldn't find the key  well i'm not terribly keen on the thought that now somebody has a  you know one of   one of their keys   mhh   ya cough   did it have a a a number on it  no but all you have to do is go through the building and try every door with the key   well guess who else is uh   knows about not having keys  three o'clock this morning i couldn't get into the house  laugh this is the other side of it laugh    oi-shh   cos i had given the key out to uh  to friends to to take care of the cat   the cats   oh ya   mhh hmm  cough   and uh so i came back ah from   from the office and i just thought oh i wa  gotta have got to get in there and get to bed  cough   couldn't get in  tristam sleeps down in his room downstairs   i banged on the basement basement doors  everything  couldn't rouse him  i i knew i couldn't anyway   so i went around to the other complex which is where uh these friends live  and i i'd given the key to helen  i knew that her son is usually up till late hours  and sure enough the light was on   rang the doorbell a couple times   and she comes down with her son   who who's trying to get us  at three in the morning  at three in the morning   laugh you know  given that she had been stalked last year   gee laugh i mean did i feel silly  but it was that or go back and sleep in the office  laugh mhh hmm   i don't know when i've done that at three in the morning  oh well   so  word i remember being locked out of of earl and mariana  's house   stupid adventures   in the middle of the night i arrived from a bus in toronto  ya  took a taxi and they hadn't we hadn't  really communicated about how to get into the house   so and i couldn't rise not " rouse" them  anybody  so i i threw a a   snowball up on the window of their student   you know this was in the house on mayfield  mhh hmm   ya  the student the student  eventually opened the window and said what are you laugh   yells   laugh   laugh   it's okay  it's just old me laugh   can you let me in please laugh   laugh   ya  well you know be because   of of living in  i i lived just in the condo just next to where you were  ya ya   and uh there's so many people around there that i didn't want to yell and scream and kind of   oh sure   when i got in i said to tristam nice guy you know uh
