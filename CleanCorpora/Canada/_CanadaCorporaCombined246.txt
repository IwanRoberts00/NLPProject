 thank you ladies and gentlemen for being so attentive  the uhm duty you have here is obviously a great responsibility and certainly my client appreciates ah your  word in this regard and   quite frankly this is word probably the highest duty that can uhm be placed upon citizens in this country  and that is giving judgment upon one of their fellow citizens on charges of murder  as you probably know word a  responsibility that could be cast upon the shoulders of any person  in that regard the uhm whenever  there's a charge of murder we three or four words   at that point someone is dead   and quite frankly my remarks are extremely focused  word in on those aspects that  subconsciously one has to overcome the idea because we're not accustomed to having uh bodies that die by trauma  it's all very uh unnatural and unusual  but that doesn't mean that a crime was committed  in fact i really wish three or four words   there's no crime committed unless you twelve people decide that there was a crime committed  that uhm  if i find word lawfully three words then there's no crime  it's as simple as that  the uhm ah the two words even asked himself to two words  something that he two words   being logical and being sarcastic you ask yourself again that he shouldn't have done anything wrong  but i suggest that when you're confronted with the stark reality afterwards a dead body and something that's referred to as a  murder weapon four or five words crime   my suggestion has been there is no murder weapon  yet  there was a hammer inside   he was killed by a hammer   but that doesn't make it murder  and and we shouldn't talk about   after the murder or the murder weapon    unless you jurors decide that it was a murder it was simply  a death and the hammer was the instrument which effected that  now moving onto uh the second issue which like the judge two or three words   the most fundamental of all rules in our justice system which makes us as a civilized society quite different from  some societies that at least uhm from my opinion for et  for whatever it's worth are less civilized because  that is the rule that the power for the state to convict one of its citizens of a crime that they must show beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime was perpertrated and perpertrated by the accused  beyond a reasonable doubt  that of course is the ruling in many places  in many places the tribunal gets to interrogate the accused often in a less than satisfactory manner and there is no burden on the state to prove guilt but rather the  the accused must convince the uh tribunal that they're  innocent   and the idea of proving something beyond a reasonable doubt  what makes sense is the state should have to prove that the accused is guilty   the one thing that i'd suggest subconsciously i may be wrong but i'd suggest something that you really have to keep in the forefront of your mind is not to do it on the balance of probability   because that is in my opinion the thing that would be the most likely way to decide something  what's more probable   uhm and when you're deciding something like a case  where someone is on trial for a criminal matter on any issue such as a defence such as self-defence or uh whether or not the accused did something uhm the burden is on the state to show this beyond a reasonable doubt  in other words uh five or six words that  in essence you must be sure   rather than just guessing at which is most likely you must be sure in order for you to decide something   ah i guess four or five words   so in other words dealing with what really is the key issue in the case that the defence two words  that being self-defence   i'm gonna going to word  review two or three words issues that i project bear on the issue of self-defence that   one of those is the accused taking the witness stand and telling you that she acted in self-defence   and as i mentioned before she testified and i'll mention again you can feel word   you don't have to feel that she's probably right   unless you are sure that she is wrong or five or six words sure that she's not telling the truth two words yourself that you could two or three words  it  it's possible merely possible that what she says about self-defence is correct  if that's a possibility that is reasonable then your duty  it is clean and clear  you one or two words spend any time deliberating at that point   each of the twelve of you have decided that yes there's definitely a reasonable possibility that she acted in self-defence  then your duty is very clear  you are required by law to bring a word  verdict in   not guilty   and you have done your duty   and justice has been served   and if you were to do anything else justice would die in your hands   my client will not be found guilty unless it's proved  beyond a reasonable doubt that she didn't act in self-defence and beyond a reasonable doubt that none of the lesser uh charges apply   the uhm lesser charges are always an option  and i'm not gonna going to spend a great deal of time dealing with them   but ah i shouldn't say charges ah there's one lesser charge and that is manslaughter but there's two different ways uhm that ah the defence particularly sees you might reach that result   but you only would even deal with that if you had rejected  beyond a reasonable doubt self-defence  and that is if uh if  self-defence isn't applicable so that it was shown that the person  deliberately did a killing with this murder uhm and  if the person is provoked or drunk to a certain e   degree uhm then it will be manslaughter  now i'm not going to try and explain the degree of intoxication  or the degree of provocation that would be necessary for the lesser offences  i will leave that to your lordship   however in that regard i will comment upon the other  and i trust that i currently am on your word  here  don't uh   uh i didn't take any notes three or four words   uhm i thought there were word  like you people did  and uhm i have my own misconceptions and my own difficulties hearing and   so i'll emphasize don't don't  rely on stuff that i may say may differs from the witness says  but on the issue of drunkenness uhm the  uh the one witness that was a  obviously a friend of paddy warbucks uhm  that testified right at the start three words uh  it was my recollection that she described paddy the next day  as as being uh either drunk or stoned  i don't know which one she used   and that this would uh uh be obviously  some number of hours uh we could infer after the actual incident occurred  uh likewise on the issue of drunkenness i would encourage you to consider particularly her testimony   uh the amount that she is said to drink   uhm i suggest it's not surprising she doesn't know how much she had to drink  when it's obvious that she went out to use the  word to get loaded   e i suggest that it wasn't it wasn't just a social type of drinking that one might ah in socializing  i suggest it was apparent from her abuse of prescription drugs  and alcohol that she wanted to get high   uhm and uhm that this incident happened during that time  one or two words   so as a fallback position and uh certainly not our position as a fallback position we suggest that drunkenness would reduce the  charge of murder to manslaughter in this case  alternatively or additionally you could also consider whether or not she was sufficently provoked by what i  sugge suggest was uhm rather disgusting and degrading things that were said to her   and the rather disrer disrespectful  uhm manner in which she was treated coupled with the constant yelling   plus the physical mistreatment and word  that she received  those i suggest are things you could consider with respect to provocation and word   in the event that you disagree with our position of self-defence then one of those two alternatives i have suggested  as a possibility it's up to you word  what the result is  i i think on on  guilty of manslaughter  now moving back to what we suggest should be the crux of the issue in this case and that is seven or eight words think about whether or not this looks like murder to you   uhm if you were a relatively small woman uh would you want to commit a murder where first of all you pick someone  that you don't know   you allow them to take you somewhere that you don't know  you have a witness along who you tell personal details about the past that are true   uhm this witness leaves so you know that there's   gonna going to be someone who can clearly identify you  and uh three or four words so to speak where you live   you don't take any instruments to effect this murder with you   and clears throat you uh don't have any means  to leave after you effect this murder   you don't dispose of the body in any way   word your you don't have the ability  to have even planned in advance to dispose of the body due to the process word belated discovery that there has even been a killing occur   and you've indiscriminately placed your fingerprints all over   i suggest nothing adds up to this being murder  it is completely illogical  rather i suggest much more inferentially probable that it was self-defence   and that my client who obviously has a disadvantaged past obviously was involved in prostitution at the time obviously has a criminal record by her testimony said oh no  you know   i'm in an awful situation  she panicked and and uh tries to cover things up  that doesn't make it murder but rather ineffectual and foolish  uhm treatment of the crime scene ah if in fact that's what it is  uh that doesn't make it a crime   the uh   now looking at things that might tend to support  word corroborate that it was self-defence  besides the illogicalness of this killing being murder  besides the fact that the rational look at it doesn't make sense  we have the corroboration of mr lepieu about  he's got a view of the scenario as he leaves just  not only does he leave as soon as things turn mean  as soon as my client is struck   the very fact that the picture that he had in his mind when he first heard that there'd been a death there was that it would be  paddy warbucks that died i suggest that picture was conveyed from him to us quite deliberately and word by  two words   and i'd suggest that my client's word  that she'd be the one that was dead if she hadn't done what she did are  completely corroborated by mr lepieu what mr  lepieu said that he expected a death  too in fact   that's the picture that he saw   sentence   after he left things were two or three words  before he left   further we have   ah certainly there are discrepancies  i mean mr lepieu says she was hit once she says she was hit twice  and she thinks both of those times occurred while mr  lepieu was there   someone's mistaken uhm   is mr lepieu perhaps trying to minimize the  predicament that he left this woman   is it perhaps somewhat embarrassing that he would ah  he allowed such a uh a  mean and violent thing to be happening  that someone's beating a woman that was obviously much smaller than than the agressor  uh and then you had uh the doctors evidence i suggest  supports her position that she was struck a couple of times   the uh   on in any event i also suggest that it was quite inappropriate for mr lepieu to leave  paddy warbucks at that house  he'd taken her out there and left her in quite a predicament   and i would suggest that it would be understandable for  hear her fear to be continually building   my learned friend questioned her quite thoroughly about  perhaps not embarking on other methods of trying to escape the situation   well hindsight's twenty-twenty  i mean really were any of his suggestions that were made to paddy warbucks feasible practical  reasonable   i suggest it would be reasonable right up until the point that uh  mr lepieu rest of utterance
