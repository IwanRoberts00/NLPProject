afternoon here's the c b c one o'clock news  the p q parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois  political party says the reversal of referendum vote results in the riding of westmount is not electoral fraud  the vice-president of the party monique simard says the yes committee is not at fault  janet macdonald reports  simard said it was the result of a stupid mistake that caused the yes and no sides to be reversed in the westmont riding  she says it wasn't the fault of the yes committee  but it was an a stupid inversion  that was even overlooked by the no side when it happened  but i presume was corrected after by mister cote's uh counts  simard says she doesn't blame cote for the discrepancies in the referendum results  she says cote was ignored by airline companies and businesses  when he warned them they were violating the referendum budget laws  simard says even yes officials had some serious problems the night of the referendum and the police were called in some instances  many many complaints on irregularities concerning uh  uh people that were impostors  that use another person's identity to vote  uhm other people that would not uh respect a certain number of rules  so i think that ahh it's important that people know that there are complaints everywhere on a certain number of things  simard says cote is the only one who can take any action in dealing with the discrepancies  she says some fifty complaints made by the national yes committee will be made public tomorrow  today is the deadline for a recount of the referendum results by the chief electoral officer pierre f cote  janet macdonald c b c news montreal  the liberal finance critic andre bourbeau says he's not surprised the p q government is proceeding with a one percent increase in the provincial sales tax next year  government officials are blaming cuts in federal transfer payments  but bourbeau says the p q knew cuts were coming  it's funny there all word  provinces canadian provinces were able to uhm balance their budget inspite of the uh cuts in federal transfers and the uh quebec uh p q government uh doesn't seem to uhh uh to be  willing to do the same there  uh they want to uh uh you know to accuse the federal government of the whole responsibility for that  bourbeau says the p q government is reluctant to make the necessary cuts in the civil service because union leaders had supported the sovereignist cause  government officials say the cuts amount to a billion dollar loss in revenues for quebec's nineteen ninety-six ninety-seven budget  the montreal health board is beginning to give details on how it will make up for the closure of seven hospitals  the board is announcing where it reallocate more than one hundred and fifty million dollars over the next three years  john peggoty reports  the board has to find ways of offering elsewhere all the services from end of tape   tape starts mid sentence out who'll join me  fred sayers on the hill  part of the world today weekend edition sunday at noon  right here on newstalk eight hundred c j a d where if you miss a little  i took him out  you miss a lot intro music plays overtop of speaker c   now from the most listened to newsroom in quebec this is news from the source  newstalk eight hundred c j a d montreal  the liberian refugees find a home  the micheal como inquest resumes  the weather not too bad and warming up a little bit  and we get the name of the car bomb victim this morning  in chateauguay  good afternoon  george fraser with news and comments at high noon on a day that is really not bad not bad  it's not exactly hot yet uh but it's getting there  it is warming up  it was below freezing in parts of the laurentiens this morning  so it's uh mostly sunny  there's a bit of cloud but mostly sunny downtown  a bit breezy but not like yesterday  and the tempurature has moved up to thirteen degrees downtown  be a little cooler than that where you are but uh not  bad at all  however we will get some cloud later on today and thursday doesn't look too good  not a bad week though  meantime the car bomb this morning  it happened at about six fifteen  a bomb exploded killing a man driving a car around saint-francis street in chateauguay  right by the zellers store there  we now know his name  his name was gord andrew   a n d r e w  he was thirty-five years old  but police say they know nothing about him  he had no record whatsoever  he was not known to police  so the victim of the car bombing in chateauguay this morning  gord andrew   but all we know about him so far is that he's thirty-five or was thirty-five and did not have a police record  meantime in the laval courthouse this morning the  resumption of the inquest into the death of micheal como   you may recall it was just about a year ago may thirty-first last year that como was shot and killed by a police officer in montreal  he was suspect in a shoplifting incident  and uhm the story is that the gun went off accidently when  como was on the ground uh being apprehended by police  uh the ambulance technician who was uh on the witness stand this morning said that when he got there como was alive but had a very weak pulse  and of course he died shortly afterwards  and we have a new picture to look at in connection with the murder of police constable raymond gagnon who as you know was murdered in senneville recently  the new picture is a picture of a man robbing a bank of montreal  there's now some reason to believe that he escaped in a car that may have been the same car that was the car that raymond gagnon stopped in senneville when he was shot and killed  so that picture is now being published and police are asking all of our listeners and all montrealers to take a look at the picture and see if it might be somebody that they recognize  politics  well would there ever be a day in quebec where we didn't have politics i ask you  but of course of course of course  and so the politics continue  jean chr&eacute;tien saying that he's sorry that lucien bouchard has cancelled his meeting with the prime minister for next week but he hopes that they can get together soon and that they can talk about working together to make canada work  not a whole lot of hope of that at the moment mind you  the census  this is a census day in canada  everybody in canada eleven million housholds involved  supposed to fill out the form and send it in today to ottawa  uh most people got a short form that only takes a few minutes to fill out  some got a longer form which takes quite a while to fill out as my wife and i found out last night  a lot of questions on that long form which we were unlucky enough to get i guess  conference board of canada says the next twelve months uh the economy is going to weaken from west to east  in other words very good in british columbia not bad in the west fairly good in ontario not very good in quebec and even less  good going east from quebec with the worst place to be being newfoundland  and those refugees who have been on a boat a desperate terrible boat about four thousand of them from uh the liberian capital finally have been accepted as refugees in ghana  many of them are so terribly sick that they might not even survive  c j a d news time is uh twelve oh five  at ten o'clock this morning the coldest place in the country was yellowknife  uh it was minus seven  the warmest was a tie between winnipeg and portage la prarie  they both had thirteen  which is where we are now in downtown montreal  but that was uh at ten o'clock our time  it was raining unusual eh in vancouver and victoria  snowing in fort mcmurray and grande prarie alberta  snowing also in peace river  raining in prince albert saskatchewan  and that's it  once you got uh east of prince albert there was no precipitation at all   and the white house you know we've had all the controversy here about the gay rights amendment well the white house says ah president clinton opposes same-sex marriage and may sign a bill to outlaw it   uh press secretary mike mccurry says clinton believes  this is a time to strengthen the american family   the bill would make the definition of marriage as only a legal union between one man and one woman and he would make that a part of federal law in the united states  the word spouse would be legally defined  as being a person of the opposite sex only  clinton's on record since nineteen ninety-two as opposing same-sex marriage even as you know there has been a certain amount of pressure uh to allow it  rosanne's final program of the season is on television tonight  uh but it will it will not be the final program ever  it had been scheduled the end of the rosanne program  but now she has decided that ah she's a new woman she says and so next year uh the program will be back   but apparently it's a because they thought it was going to be the end of the series altogether it's a real heartstopper   you can pardon the expression  with the whole cast dealing with uh dan's heart attack on the rosanne program  my medical story  scientists are hailing the result of a small trial of an experimental text for alzheimer's disease  they say the results are accurate so far but hurdles have to be overcome before the test can go into wide clinical use  nevertheless the test seems to have worked out very well  it uses skin and blood cultures and measures d n a damage  in the body  it correctly pinpointed all twenty-seven alzheimer's patient  in an initial study  identifying both the early onset kind of alzheimers and the more common form that comes later in life  so far doctors can't do much for patients with alzheimer's as probably you know but a correct diagnosis helps rule out other causes of dementia that can be treated  so therefore you narrow the danger down  and uh this is an aw-shucks story if ever there was one   a seven year-old girl in new mexico has agreed to get seven painful rabies shots to save the life of a little bear cub  that bit her  the black bear cub bit margaret marris'   finger as she was trying to lug it home as a pet not realizing that was kind of dangerous  she could have avoided the shots for rabies but that would have meant having the bear killed and tested for rabies  margaret said no you're not going to kill that bear  i'll take the shots   aw-shucks
