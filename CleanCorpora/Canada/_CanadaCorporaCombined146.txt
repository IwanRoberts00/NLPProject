 good morning mister dufour   yeah good morning  last week when we talked to you you seemed to be saying you were a a fou co-founder   of this movement   no   now you're not going to be taking part  what's going on here   i never said i was co-founder   the see lots of things have changed from the time i was invited to the time to what i read in le devoir   the way i look back at it i've i've been used by tillman   and and first of all i wanted to  i want to make it very clear that i have nothing to do with la mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais   i'm only a member  and now looking back at it i can see why they invited me  this guy wanted to make to to  pretend that the mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais was supporting his movement  and that's why he invited me because he knew i   i was a memeber  mister du dufour     now the mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais  has got nothing to do with this and i want it make   i want it to be very clear to everybody  and they are very this has hurt that movement   and they have never supported it  they would never support it either  mister dufour what was it that you  either that you read in le devoir or you've heard mister tillman say since then that  that made you change your mind  word   well the the movement was presented to me as a peaceful movement  as a way to unite sovereigntists not " sovereignists" like me who want to speak out when it's time to speak out  but who also want to unite in doing positive things and  and and and see a   as far as i'm concerned it's it was  just about the set-up  like they presented they present it as being peaceful and and it turned out  i'm totally against racism  i'm against uhh violence  i'm against uh using any any ways that is not legal  and and i i  look because when i spoke to you last week i didn't read le devoir   i never heard i was never told of the secret movement  i was never told about any manifesto or anything    but but but   m mister dufour when i spoke to you last week  uhm and and i just listened to the tape again before uhh b before we   before we're talking here uhm i said to you are you one of the founders or you're among the founders and  and you didn't say no then  we went through a number of the elements of the manifesto as reported in le devoir   you said you were generally supportive of the manifesto you were aware of the manifesto  so i i don't quite understand this morning you're saying you didn't have knowledge of it  well i was aware of the things they wanted to s  stand for  now there is positive things in there which i agree with  but i sure when i talked to you i didn't see i didn't have that man manifesto  or what what was it what it was   and like this thing about uhh uhh immigration and so on like i knew nothing about that  like i i agree that quebecers have to stand up for for what they believe in  i agree that uhh cough we we  have to defend ourselves too because it seems to be in this country everybody has the right to defend their rights except quebecers so uhh   w well  but when i asked you specifically about that question   of of immigration i it's  true you didn't say that you uhh you  thought we should stop immigration but but   but but   you did   well i didn't know what you were talking about   that's why   but you but you said that you know that it was your feeling that immigrants came and spit on quebecers  so you were using some pretty tough language yourself  yeah in a way yeah  but i don't blame immigrants for doing that  what i blame is the federal system  because i have lots of friends who are immigrants and i know i've spoke to lots of people coming from other countries and it's the federal government who've set them up to be against quebec right from the start  like i don't blame them at all  i i don't blame them i'm   and and i'm i'm  against being racist to these people  it's not their fault  mister dufour   it is true that it's true that  very often they have an attitude but i'm not blaming it for them  mister dufour   i'm not blaming them for that it's not their fault  mister dufour last week uhh we heard of fifteen people who'd come together for the beginnings of this uhh at the time you seemed to ah accept that you might of been among those fifteen  whether  no   you knew exactly what it was or not  have you spoken with some other people who are in  in the same boat as you  who had been as you say sold sold a bill of goods here   told it was one thing only to find out it's something else  yeah and there's the mouvement sovereignist de qu&eacute;bec i spoke to them and they were also told like that there was no mention of any possibility of any violence because again the  mouvement sovereignist de qu&eacute;bec is against violence and like i know that right from the start  like and and they were never told of that like  i think this guy he painted a pretty picture of what this movement would be  and he ahh he kind of talked to people he knew were uhh wanted to to ahh to do actions but ahh   but but you weren't suspicious that this guy was an ex-falquist ex member of the front du liberation du qu&eacutebec you know   no like i did this guy   was not even supposed to be there in the first place  i didn't even know who that was  it was supposed to be ahh will sobonne   so it was mister sobonne who approached you  no it's ahh i'm trying to remember the name of the  per person it's somebody from the organization but like they will sobonne was not even there when they spoke to me  it's just that's they invited me that's   that's a few weeks ago  and it wasn't   and it wasn't mister tillman who approached you  no no no i didn't even know this guy was there   and you   i learned that when i read le devoir and i just about fell off my chair  and you won't be there this weekend   for their meeting   no way   no way because i i  refuse to support any individual who who who does not uh refuse violence and racism  because i am totally against racism  i think it's the stupidest thing  and against violence   miss miss   mister   no way i will take part in anything that's  anything   i i've done in the past we've made sure we do it with a smile on our face  and and it i i   think violence it's the worst it   it's the worst enemey of quebec  mister dufour thanks for talking to us again today this morning  kay okay   good bye  bye bye  that's roy dufour with the mouvement imp&eacute;ratif fran&ccedille;ais of outaouais   twenty-five minutes after eight   last week it was confirmed by the city of montreal that three library outlets would be closed in uhh saint-henri little burgundy in n d g  notre dame de gr&acircumflex;ce and at the mcgill metro  and then ahh news a little later in the week that a fourth uhh library outlet would also be on the chopping block  well last night in n d g a group of citizens got together to protest that decision by the city of montreal  hannah walkerton was one of the people there  she is with the friends of benny library and has been involved in a number of initiatives in her neighbourhood  good morning miss walkerton   good morning  miss walkerton could you maybe describe the benny library for me before we get into just what you think you can do to stop the city on this one  what what's it like  well well from the outside it's a   a fum a beautiful former chapel it's ahh part of our heritage in n d g  ah it it was built right after world war two to serve the veterans that came back from the war and uhh about ten years later i guess be  there a bigger church was built and uhh it was turned over and taken over by the city and turned into a library  so it's been there as an institution for about forty years serving the community  uhh largely the senior citizens of ahh benny farm right now  and and the young people  uhh more and more the collection in the library is about seventy percent french books and thirty percent english  so uhh it serves my needs for reading mostly bestsellers   and and i do some reference work with the kids there  it's a really homey atmosphere  ahh the kids lots of children from below sherbrooke street in the  apartment complexes come and flock there after school  it's like home you know  you don't get x-rayed on the way in or or   on the way out  it's just it's like walking into your own kitchen and the tables  so you know it's it's not brand new and it doesn't have all the amenities of a maison de couture  house of culture   but what it has is heart  and the people there know our children by name and they can help them with their homework  it's ahh it's an important place for me especially because i've decided to live in this society and to stay here  and my children are both in french school  and it might seem funny to people out there but my eight-year old and fourteen-year old barely read english  they need french culture access  they need services in french  i think our city sees these books as this is what this is  a building with books  and they don't realize that the people there who talk to my children in french since they've been in diapers have helped them integrate  into the society  had had helped them be just  like the little kids in their class that have been hearing french at home since laugh they came out of the womb  miss miss walkerton when we talked to the mayor last week about this he said that in that part of the city the city was investing money in private libraries and so the population was going to be well served by library services but primarily through the private libraries  yeah   what what do you make of that  well they said that they were in partnership they named i made her name the libraries because nobody could tell me which ones they were  and she she named two that i'm not familiar with  uhh uhm the frasier hickston is one they say they might  they almost have a private an accord   with but they've never given them money before  the montreal children's library is located in john-twenty-third school and it's in uhm a part of n d g below uhh the tracks and so uhh in that respect i agree that they should be because the children down there could never cross ahh you know you wouldn't want them crossing the tracks  there's just not enough access points  but you don't want the kids from above the tracks to have   t to do the same thing to get to a library  no but the library the children's library in uhh located in  john-twenty-third school is also i don't want my library to become like that because what it is its got very little service and it doesn't have anim&eacute; well what they call animation animation   yeah yeah   uhh it's a growing thing a library  you have to keep putting money into it  you have to keep buying books  if they just say give you we'll give you   all the books here you know put them you can  distribute them to the the people  the books would die very quickly  they'll become out of date ahh  miss walkerton i'm wondering wh   what do you do now  ahh as i understand it seventy or eighty people turned up last night to demand some answers   oh i think it was more   i put out a hundred and five chairs so ahh   okay and they were filled
