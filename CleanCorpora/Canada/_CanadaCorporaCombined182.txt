 but uh whichever way it is we're get  get uh the bears are getting  tossed out of a lot of draws tonight and uh i'm not too sure the cause of that   aaron zarowny against calvin flint on this faceoff   dinosaurs win it and masters plays it ahead to thompson   to johnson   pardon me  and away goes couldwell  he's across the line  jams on the brakes  and it's batted away  bears have it  aaron zarowny a two-on-one  zarowny moving in  has simpson with him  zarowny moves in  shoots  and he ripped it wide of the net  comes out to centre   hjertaas flips it back in  couldwell comes up with it  bumps into hjertaas and simpson takes over  he'll pound it off the boards and deep into the calgary end it goes  nice try by aaron zarowny on the two-on-one  good shot just wide  krywulak long lead pass up the left side for couldwell  has johnson with him   passes to johnson  steps across the line  johnson feeding it in  save by masson   that was a mix up in front of the net and masson stopped it  here's strand  and the big hip check by ruark  moving in goodkey  goodkey with a blast  save by dawkins   strand feeling the effects of a hipcheck by ruark   bit of a charley horse i think  here's johnson the other way  he lets a blast go  save on the short side  masson got a piece of it  dinosaurs working it in now  here's schonek with a shot  that's blocked  and tiltgen will clear it out to centre ice  tiltgen trying to move it ahead to ranger  ranger bumped by schonek  bears fire it in on goal  it's offside at the blue line with sixteen oh nine to go in the second   and this game starting to open up a bit jeff   big hits  and paul strand he got porked by ruark  and uh he definitely felt that  he went came off the ice uh   limpin' limping and he's still uh is getting looked at by the trainer in the back of the bears' bench   it was about this time last night that the bears lost their leading scorer for a penalty and a game misconduct  this time he's being tended to at the bear bench  some concern down there i'm sure  big colin ranger out here for the bears  and they they need a little pick up and somebody to rock somebody's world  marble with it for calgary  over for ziliniak  and he'll flip it high in the air to the bears' zone  pullishy back to scoop it up   fires it around the boards for goodkey  softly up the wing for ranger  takes the hit ziliniak   now the dinosaurs work it in to the faceoff circle  but pullishy comes up with it and he'll send it up the open wing and out to centre ice   ziliniak's there  on the right side for morrison  lots of room  morrison moving in  morrison feeds it in front of the net  and tied up was murray for calgary  now they centre it out front for eremenko  bears clear though  here they go  tiltgen one-on-one against marble  tiltgen waiting for someone to catch up  tiltgen makes a move a nice one  passing in for degner  can't get the shot away   can't redirect it   and it's deep in the calgary zone  they clear up the wall  bears take over though  degner to the point   christiansen holding it onside  jickling after the puck left circle   takes a look top of the left circle  lets the shot go  saved by dawkins as degner was creating a screen in front  maybe the bears' best shift of the night   i'm i agree with you evan   and dean tiltgen made that shift  eh we watched him uh  he roasted evan marble  it's tough to do  very nice play between his legs and then a nice pass to degner and uhm degner almost had the one-time for the almost the open-net goal  draw to the stick-hand side of dawkins   dinosaurs in front two nothing in this one   we have fifteen ten left in the second period   jickling will face off against townsend   jickling wins it back to christiansen at the left point   he'll work it along the left-wing boards to the corner  being checked by schmalz   thompson in there to help out  thompson and christiansen they kick it free  jickling along the boards  being checked there by ruark   schmalz trying to walk it up the wing   he comes up with it  jickling all tied up by ruark  dinosaurs get to it and townsend clearing it ahead to centre ice  stephenson tips it in across the bear line but christiansen's back to play it   he clears the zone  schmalz will dump it right back in   there's adair deep in his own end  adair ahead for haney on the wing   pegg will hold it in on the right point  along the boards it goes  adair picks it up  he lofts it  there's townsend behind the net   he tried to get by adair but adair took him down   here goes thompson speeding to centre ice  mike thompson in across the line on the left side for haney  thompson goes after it himself  thompson turns to the left corner   looking for some help   it comes up the wall  hjertaas will hold it in  along the boards it goes  now jickling from the left point holds it in   to hjertaas on the left-hand boards  to the corner for thompson   thompson takes a look  thompson drops it back  moving in is simpson  simpson sharp angle  his shot is blocked by haney  went off the shaft of haney's stick and it's cleared down the ice  pegg had a hold of thompson  thompson's trying to cover on the right point  had a hold on his jersey and that's allowed calgary to clear the zone  icing charged against the dinosaurs  well another good shift by the bears there thompson jickling and degner and uh that's about three or four in a row and that's what they need to see  get some momentum going  paul strand doesn't appear to be coming back any time soon  he he really got crunched  and uh that's uh he looked in a lot of pain when he went off the ice a few minutes ago   he's not on the bench   might be trying to walk it off downstairs jeff behind the bears' bench  off the draw r marble has it for calgary  clears it ahead to johnson   johnson now out to centre ice  intended for lovsin  so they're double-shifting johnson here   bears clear down the ice  marble takes the long road in there and they wave off the icing because of it   marble from his own zone  gave it away  here's esposito moving in  esposito lets the shot go  the save by dawkins   and esposito might have passed to ranger out front but ranger had fallen as he turned   and dawkins holding onto it   evan evan   marble has actually looked human on his last two shifts  made a couple mistakes and he's had a puck uh most of this series  and uh good play by frank esposito to strip him of the puck and  and with frank he's gotta got to shoot  he's got a good shot and it's been going in for him  uh this one caught dawkins basically the numbers though  faceoff stick-hand right side of dawkins   he's becoming bigger in that net by the minute  yes he is   he looks a little bit more confident every second   out covering the angles well   here come the dinosaurs out of their own zone  couldwell trying to get around sherben  sherben spun him around at centre  aaron zarowny with it  ahead for simpson  he drags it in across the line  lets the snapshot go  he fanned on it   it goes to the corner  zulyniak will take him out and couldwell goes back to play it   couldwell with big hit on colin zarowny   zarowny right back up though  simpson now for zarowny in the left corner   zarowny trying to work around  zulyniak has a hold of him  and a penalty coming up against calgary   and i think it might be holding against zulyniak  we'll be back in a moment  two nothing dinosaurs lead the bears but the bears are going to work on the powerplay when we come back on sports radio c j s r f m eight-eight commercial, 35 sec   evan bok along with jeff rankin back in calgary  father david bauer arena  bears going to work on the powerplay  they're down two nothing and they desperately need a powerplay goal here   the puck's back in the bears' zone  masson clears it up the wing   jickling will go after it   jickling skating up the right wing trying to get away from schmalz but schmalz took it away  tiltgen there to follow up  for degner   degner's bowled over  but here's thompson across the line  thompson guns it around the boards   comes up on the left wing for jickling   goes deep to the corner for degner  degner behind the net for thompson  nobody out front  tiltgen to the point for trevor sherben  trevor sherben with a blast and he missed the target  he hammered it   jickling from the left point   thompson in the corner  back to jickling   jickling in the corner  he gave it away to ruark  and ruark a chance to clear it   he'll skate with it to centre and now tap it softly into the golden bear zone  big blast by trevor sherben  and i think it hit something  just missed the far side  bears on the powerplay down two nothing here in calgary  lead pass right side  tiltgen across the line  lets the shot go  off the blocker of goaltender dawkins   jickling behind the net to degner   degner trying to centre out front  that went off a skate back behind the goal  thompson with it   now for tiltgen on the right-wing boards  into the corner   thompson to tiltgen top of the right circle  moves in  to thompson  thompson walks out front  backhand shot  pegg blocks it and covers up  real nice slide block by uh jaime pegg  uh all coaches when they're uh showing the defensive coverage on the pe penalty killing use that and the the offside d-man shorthand for 'defenceman'  comes over and slide blocks on the two-on-one coming out of the corner  and a a real nice play by pegg on that  play   manitoba bisons lead regina cougars five nothing  the start of the third in game two of that series   and regina ahead one nothing in the series but the bisons they come out gunnin' gunning tonight  back-to-back weekends the cougars are going three games  and uh a lot of hockey for the cougars   faceoff will be to the glove-hand side of dawkins  forty-eight seconds left in this golden bear powerplay  and a golden opportunity to get into the game  they're down two nothing   not out of it but as the game wears on that lead  becomes seems to be larger and larger  the next goal's huge  here's pegg with it in his own end  he'll gun it up the boards and all the way down the ice   back to scoop it up is goodkey   goodkey from behind his net   mark goodkey lost it for a moment  now goes to chase it down in the corner  eremenko in forechecking   goodkey gets by him   krywko ahead   now haney with it  over to goodkey   missed him with a pass  goodkey sends it across the line but pegg will send it down the other way   a little sloppy in this breakout but here they go   here's a chance for haney  he's across the line  haney moving in  haney pass for aaron zarowny and aaron zarowny couldn't knock down the pass  bears nearly had a breakaway  bad change by the dinos and almost merv haney to hit uh a flying simpson  masson a heads-up play there to head-man the puck real quick  here's krywko now  the penalty is over  krywko to the line and across
