 mm hmm  actually he is taking a course now  so then it's word applicable  okay   breath uhm we're gonna going to  call that uhh contribution from equity laugh   i'm not sure quite what the terminology is i'm just gonna  going to show you my startup costs  mm hmm  uhh but before we get to that uhm we're going to be sort of earmarking ten thousand dollars for this   and i put it in as a contribution from equity   okay  uhh do i have to calculate an opportunity cost for that it's still like in say term deposits and it's in terms it's not like sitting there doing nothing in a bank  right   do you guys need to purchase assets   that's basically what it's is  used for  yeah yeah   so you're taking ten thousand dollars and purchasing assets with the ten thousand dollars  well four or five words installation of the phone and everything that's gonna going to   two words in june or july  from a financial perspective you wouldn't take into consideration opportunity costs  the opportunity costs would come into play before you made the decision to go in business  that is to say i have ten thousand dollars should i start a business or should i put it in the bank you know what i m   right   that that and so what you do is look at the interest rates available in the bank and then say well if i go in business here's what i project  so you already have based on your performance a certain amount of projections which take into account the opportunity costs  okay  so in other words let's assume your return on investment is  gonna going to be twenty percent in the business when all is said and done  so if you were to put it in the bank you might get like eight percent  so in essence   one or two words laugh  ehhh i know  and so in essence the difference is what you gained in opportunity costs  yeah  so that but that's a background uhm  that's an internal controlling uh mechanism that's not anything to do with necessarily uh the financial it doesn't have to be reported in the financial statements and so on and so forth  yeah   the opportunity cost of money in this case is just a question of should i or shouldn't i from a financial perspective to see if it's worthwhile  th that is a decision that's had in the decision making before you go into business   right  but now that you've already invested in the business it's already established  speaker b continues talking as speaker z interrupts - private discussion lasts for about one minute   okay so i wanna want to take into consideration this opportunity cost because in fact my word  really don't exceed anything i could get at the bank  right  and that's that's there's this   i mean   i mean word mutual funds is not   a sure thing  i mean entrepreneurship is not a decision you always make on a basis of uh financials but basically that's part of the the  the myth of an investor  okay  in other words if you said to me wanna want to put ten thousand dollars into my company then i'm concerned in terms of my opportunity cost  in other words like i could get seven percent say what could i get from you sorta sort of thing  okay   is it too late for you to look at a draft  no  i would have loved to have gotten one to you before you left but i really was not able to do that   no it d i can do  uh   i can have that for wednesday  if i get it to you   sure  cos uh cos i can work on it tonight or tomorrow and uh i can give you some feedback  so i could go make these corrections that i had from the weekend   mmm you made some word   and yeah yeah yeah no you don't wanna  want to edit this  no i'll fix it   print you off a better copy   uhm this is what i wanted to just show you my startup costs   sure i'll give you a good i can give you some feedback on it before you uh  when are you presenting  two or three words   wednesday  oh this wednesday right  so that's okay   because that will give you time  well just i'm constrained by the fact that my computer at home is incompatible with these here at school  oh  and the school is closed for four days   that's true two words   so i have to finish it on thursday and do like little cosmetics on tuesday and that's it  hmm mm hmm  it's out there laugh   wow  breath so  well uhh it's uh   some of us are   i'll long, drawn out 'i' have your feedback on wednesday on your written  not too short notice  no no no  and you're gonna going to get feedback on wednesday for your oral presentation from myself and the students  okay  so then we that will give you the opportunity to   fine tune it  fine tune it  because then breath the following wednesday is the last day  is that how it works out   mm hmm   so coming back on that last wednesday that's when it's actually due  right  but really whatcher what you're  looking there is cosmetic changes and you know uhhh an alteration or an addition of a paragraph here or there  okay  i've written it in the first person is that alright?  yep that's fine  sure it should be  okay   okay  i mean it has more power in first person  word   i thought maybe it was less businesslike but  that's it's something that i care personally about  and it just came that way  oh yeah   unclear utterance   unclear utterance   you see there were   if you were writing it as a business proposal kay  okay then it would be more appropriate to be in the third person  okay  when you do an entrepreneurship case it should be in first person because you are the key element  right  i mean you are the entrepreneur you are the business  and so the business word is first person you lose a lot of credibility as in well say you know this is an opportunity uh someone could do this or do that and then it doesn't have the power or the impact of saying here's what i'm gonna going to do  that that sorta sort of   thing  okay  so i i i think the first person is most word   kay okay   this is similar to something that was set up in the book   i don't know if this is what you're looking for  uhh projected sources of startup   sources of startup funds   so this is what we have now and then this is gonna  going to come from that ten thousand dollar investment that we're making  mm hmm   and you assets that you're presently putting in the business  yes  so in essence your total contribution will be this plus this  right  uhh the ten thousand dollars then is the total  it's an acculmulation that  this ten or the other ten  yes   no this ten  that's the total of these two  right  so that's tha when you're talking terms of ten thousand dollars you're talking about five and five  or roughly five and five  yeah   five thousand dollars is   like we have five now we're  gonna going to put another five in   your computer and uhh your computer this that and you're gonna going to  put five thousand in cash  and then i have another five thousand still earmarked  oh okay uh uh i must've  contingency fund  right mm hmm which is perfect  this is great   do you need to see contingency fund anywhere  well normally it has it in startup costs as a twenty percent addition  okay  and it's at the end of all your startup costs you  you just put on a twenty percent for contingencies  another twenty percent   that way it covers everything that now you see  what you forgot  okay  so in uh in essence you've already accounted for an overrun  and then you can make a a point in your financials in the in the word  essay descriptive portion to say that in essence you'll have another five thousand dollars on the sidelines that you would not  prefer to put in the business at this time but it will be available in the uh   yeah   to fall back on  yeah mm hmm  okay  and you just for whatever reason don't wanna  want to put it in right now  kay okay and the statement of assets could i make it april first  statement of assets uhh the assets that you started right   difference of the balance sheet and it was   yeah  yeah and so sure your startup date can be whenever you selected could be 'select it' as the startup date  april first is fine  okay  mmm then i'll do the word in the end december thirty-first  right because you're you've got a  word fiscal uh laugh you can't go a laugh  no you can't change that after   word march thirty-first then because now you're restricted  is that just quebec or is that a canadian thing  i think that's  federal or  i'll make sure  i know it's quebec  yeah because i know then that used to be the opportunities and you could work and create your own fiscal year  juggle it around a bit   okay  what companies can't do that in there either it's not just a question of startups or small business  no it's everyone  everyone  so even large corporations and everything hafta  have to go to a calendar year  hmm  i guess there were too many little loopholes  yeah well for sure  it's also really difficult for them probably to keep track of everything  yeah mm hmm   they have everyone with different year ends  right  okay  so that's it you're all set for wednesday  okay   kay okay   sigh   so tell me in in relation to uhm you know what we talked about last week you know with the  word and the word and the larger one you know we talked about the finishes  mm hmm  like i'm wondering if you could tell me your response to the drawing in you know in the context of some of the things that we spoke about  sniff mkay okay   uhhm i dunno don't know i had a lot of problems with just figuring out what background i wanted to put with this  mm hmm  i ended up uhh i dunno don't know   trying to figure out where i was gonna going to  put the lettering and the words and stuff like that and what kind of  like you were telling me the content you know and what words i   kinda kind of wanna want to  add to the drawing and stuff like that and should it have meaning and stuff  mm hmm  and i think the thing the most that i'm doing right now is just having fun with the idea of playing with the f the   the kitschiness of the movie posters and stuff like that and the objects  mm hmm  but also uh i dunno don't know  exploring the idea of yeah how to composition and the medium  i think i'm really starting to enjoy like   so you're really getting involved in the formal aspect of the work through an i the image that interests you  but right now like right now your concerns are really about the handling the materials the colours you know word placings the composition  yeah yeah   so in fact your concern is very formal in the work  yeah more formal than i would say like thinking about i  dunno don't know uhh if i'm trying to get a certain meaning across or anything like that  mm hmm  i'm not really dealing with that as much as i think  just having fun with the idea that you know i enjoy the uhh just the nostalgia feel of even these posters   mm hmm   like i can remember when i was five years old looking at them  and going oooh the spacey you know eerie greens and stuff like that  mm hmm   so they're kind of memory images too  uhm yeah i would say so yeah i would say so very much  like you know watching you know wolfman as a kid you  know or dracula with bela lugosi be like oh my god nightmares for  you know days on end but  uh huh   right   so you're crea recreating  a time and a space that you were in   pretty much in a sense yeah   when you were a child  yeah well also with the objects kind of relating back to that too you know like i dunno don't know if the the wax candle owl you know signifies i dunno don't know  uhm well i guess in a sense it signifies you know memories and stuff like that cos why would i take these objects
