 it has been argued that this development of feminist geography parallels developments in other humanist geographic research such as marxist  and phenomenological studies   as two words although the content of the questions asked differs in these disciplines researchers who  asked about social word about class relations and about social meaning in human action experience a similar process of emerging dissatisfaction with the capacity of a given disciplinary framework's comfort handling their questions and the changes which inspired them  the debates among human geographers questioned the definition of geography as a so solely spatial science and reintroduced human environmental relations as essential concerns of the discipline   word feminist geographers in the united states in canada and in great britain concur that feminism did come later to geography than to other social sciences and that its influence has been both remarkably negligible and word   but few of these theorists questioned why it was that the theoretical and empirical achievements of feminism have been almost completely ignored in geography  i suggest that feminism has not succeeded in significantly influencing traditional geographic thought because of the singularly androcentric that is male-dominated or male-centred nature of the discipline  now male dominance is neither specific to geography nor to other  word   it pervades all society and as such it is reflected in our institutions  but perhaps male dominance is especially prevalent in geography   jenna martin and susan manson briefly considered the reasons for the me meagre  word feminism in geography and they conclude that the answer lies in the word number of women in the discipline historically  they say the number of women involved in generating knowledge in a given discipline appears to be important in determining the degree to which feminism is absorbed in a specific academic research institution   as all knowledge is a social creation it reflects the conditions out of which it is produced and transmitted   geographic knowledge and theory a few words  with men's knowledge and theory and word men who have defined its focuses and interests have defined the fields the areas and the acceptable lines of study and research  it is true that historically the discipline of geography in britain in the united states and in canada is a male-dominated profession  although word students are equally represented at undergraduate levels men are predominant maybe three words  especially on the physical side of the discipline  and of the few female students who do enter the graduate levels the attrition level is high  one study from the united states shows that feminist or female graduate geography students not necessarily feminists have word  the highest uh attrition rate of all the social sciences  in fact some recent statistics published in nineteen eighty-nine in ontario show that geography is the most male-dominated social science  there are fewer women at the masters p h d and word  levels in geography than in any other social science including what i would consider traditionally male bastions of economics law and political science  to give an example closer to home i'm the only female of the seven first-year p h d stud p h d students in geography here at dean's   but the male-dominated nature of the discipline as suggested by  susan manson is not a sufficient explanation of the meagre  im impact of feminism in geography  we need to take one step backward and ask why there are so few  females in geography   i argue that it is is related to the nature of the discipline of geography which is inherently androcentric  and in sharp conflict with the nature of feminism  in fact nearly all of the human geography maybe two words has been a study of the word world  geography like any other discipline is a product of its times  the origins of western geography penetrates back to the ancient greeks in the fifth and fourth century b c where the first  philosophers the ionians including a few words and so on first began to ask questions with the shape and origin of the earth  it's interesting that the first philosophy which emerged from the west was the philosophy of nature   their aim was to create a man-made philosophy which could explain and control the whims and irrationality of nature word    women were excluded from the ranks of these philosophers and  phrase   although geography is currently divided into the human geography and physical geography the emergence of geography initially from a physical science that is geography or geology uh the study of the earth's surface is significant   this may partially explain why geography has traditionally been more male-dominated than other social sciences as hard physical sciences have historically been seen as a male endeavour and it may partially explain why it traditionally stresses the landscape a landscape which is formed and interpreted by the male gaze   a few words described this role of the male gaze in shaping the landscape  she interpreted the european occupation of the word  in the united states personified in the female body in overtly sexual terms   the association that was prevalent in ancient greece of women with the private sphere and men with the public has continued in western minds    as geographers throughout history have traditionally been men it is understandable how geography has pro has focused predominantly on public that is male spaces  hence it is not surprising that in those places on the earth where we could see the greatest interaction between man and his environment such as the ancient greek adore agora  or in contemporary urban areas it is evident that in these places they have been constructed by and for men   as women have been associated with private spaces they have relatively little opportunity to modify the landscape traditionally studied by geographers  as linda mcdowell notes geographers unlike sociologists usually exclude the small scale and the word for consideration ignoring the material world the social and spatial relationships that take place within buildings   quote continues   mcdowell is an an example of urban geography which is which has traditionally considered the production of the built environment the distribution of the urban space how households gain access to certain types of housing in particular parts of towns and cities but they stop at the front door and they ignore questions about the sexual division of labour within the home or the structural word relations within the households  thus geography's emphasis on large scale and macro processes provides another reason for the degree to which geography has remained remarkably untouched by feminist theory   as lloyd suggests geo geographers   might consider the word uh of interiors as expressions of a culture reflecting women's activities but it is important to realize that this women's culture is word  in a predominantly male architecture and design  in this paper i've attempted to understand the reasons behind geography's reluctance to adopt feminist insights as this will provide a stronger vantage point from which to ta tackle   its historically androcentric nature   this nature of geography explains why feminism was word  to geography and why feminist geography and insights in  of feminist theory in general are so little known by geographers  feminist geography provides a direct challenge to this androcentricity  it's to admit the gender bias of traditional geographic theory and to transform radically the structure of our knowledge of reality and our obsession of states of things   this discussion also contributes to the current debate of whether feminist theory and researching should be added as one thread among many within human geography or whether a feminist perspective might be developed within all the subdivisions of human geography   i see geo feminist geography  now as fitting into helene cixous's framework of binary oppositions where feminist geography is in an unprivileged position to traditional that is non-feminist geography   cixous who posits &eacute;criture f&eacute;minine  as a solution to male discourse would have undoubtedly argued that feminist geography should remain as a separate endeavour   linda peet argues that feminist geography as a separate specialist course on feminist geography would combat continuing sexism and encourage female students to sit in the academic environment   this would word to initiate a practical challenge to the male-dominated a few words of academia since as morgan hanson hanson  has argued the more women are involved in the dissemination of knowledge the greater degree to which feminism is likely to be appropriated  word research processes   but an integrationist approach would also combat sexism and it would also encourage more women to go into geography  i argue that the inherently androcentric nature of geography indicates that it is vital for geography to wholeheartedly adopt feminist   insig insights within all of human geography  if feminist geography remains as a separate and marginalized subdiscipline it will present a weaker challenge to the highly androcentric nature of geography  thus i advocate a feminist perspective within all streams of human geography as feminism has the potential to radically transform the entire discipline of geography as well as all of its attending theories methodologies and word applause  question and answer period   so our immediate interpretation relu   directly related to word by the text which engages them or are they not   have polled the five readers polled informed readers polled model readers and alike acquire an expertise that distinguishes them from the ordinary reader  are literary critics experts   if so what is the nature of their expertise   are certain strategies and codes more important than others or used more often by expert readers   if so under what circumstances   do experts and non-experts develop interpretive strategies as stanley fish claims or are they merely activating textual levels or applying codes as umberto eco would have us believe   within literary theory circles eminent theories   theorists differ widely as to the response to these questions  who is one to believe   the keyword here is perhaps believe for although theories about the role of the reader and the subjectivity of the reading process abound to date there have been few controlled studies within reader response circles which actually test reception theories  in fact few reader response scholars have provided the community with any significant empirical data to date to back up their various hypotheses or to justify the conclusions they draw of what readers respond to literature   reader response to a few great books the empirical  study book a collection of original essays i've edited for burton de gravel in the series approaches to literature aims to fill this void by reporting on recent empirical studies of reader response to literary texts  its contributors scholars from around the world reveal in this book the degree to which expert and non-expert readers use literary devices and reading strategies to make their judgements and propose interpretations  by supplying us with some sought after hard facts these scholars advance our understanding of the nature role and importance of textual levels and codes interpretive strategies and socio-historical determinacy  they do so by applying theories and techniques from many disciplines to concrete examples and reproducible experiments  the results of their empirical studies suggest that text counts that interpretive strategy counts and that culture counts  on several levels and to varying degrees their research indicates that what we read how we read and who we are all determine meaning  their empirical studies of the way ordinary readers read may also help us understand how expert readers read   for instance and this i refer to part one of the   the book if you detect this construct for instance   if it can if it can be shown as do joanne hatter  billy van deer jamie mill ted gagvillavallaboom  and jeff sanderson with greg mcguinty if it can be shown then that in many cases the apparently intuitive judgement of readers are actually based on real and measurable criteria one can then suppose that literary critics also base their interpretations of text on definable and reproducible textual clues and markers  in the same way and this i refer to the second half reduction of meaning if as shown by jane mchaley jorge veranda   lazlo gallas and raymond du maurier in this book  in this book cultural awareness and reading expertise influence the way the readers of so-called informed readers vary in certain circumstances from those of non-informed readers then these same traits should predispose culturally aware literary critics to perform as expert readers  of course i'm being a bit facetious here because you know we're  laugh all supposed to be experts but we'll play the game  to perform as expert readers when tested against so-called na&iuml;ve readers  the empirical findings of this research all this which we can't talk about today but has brought me to this point can then lead one to formulate a variety of hypo of hypotheses  regarding the way literary critics read and this indeed has been elaborated as well on this first par  part page   hypothesis one literary critics have expertise that distinguishes them from other readers
