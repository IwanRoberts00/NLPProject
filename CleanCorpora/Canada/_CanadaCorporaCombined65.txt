and he wanted us he wanted to know where cos he's going to bring all his equipment and do it in in    the hotel suite would be great  we'd have two   oh you can do it right in the hotel  oh ya he'll come up there  cos you don't want to do it in the salon says 'salaw'  be because the salon   pardon me  two words want can't  word how you say it in toronto   uhm  what do they call it salon   ya something like that  because it's closed on a sunday and he's doing this under the table  oh i see   he and his assistant will be doing  probably twelve heads of hair with uh with  any one   and he can bring all his own equipment  or does he use hotel's not 'the hotel's'   ya he'll bring everything   i mean the hotel must have stuff   no he'll bring everything   mhh  god isn't it gonna going to to be something else  it's gonna going to be a zoo  laugh   and i think i better get lunch brought in for everybody  up in the suite   it sounds terribly grand doesn't it  what time's the wedding  six   and then there're going to be pictures before  so we get everything cleaned up and do pictures in the hotel  so we'll need flowers in there too   wha it's gonna going to be   a mess   now i i'll have to get tails or ah a tuxedo or what   well it's it's black tie  so six o'clock would  be that would be tux i guess  black tie   okay   ya  okay   you could do tails  i don't know  heh  i think they're all just gonna going to  be doing tux  a couple of words anything else   i think i have one   ya if it fits  why wouldn't it  it might fit now  of course it'll fit  it wouldn't have fit a month ago  oh shut up  laugh it'll fit now though i think  so that'll be nice  so i m i must call her  what about uhm   i'll call her tomorrow   are they gonna going to   line up uh a limousine service  mhh hmm  they've done that  they've done that  mhh hmm  and the photographer and the music   the club's doing the rest  food's all done   now the rehearsal   she's chosen her menu  yup  what are they going to have  cornish hen  mhh   it's cheaper than steak or roast beef or whatever else it was going to do  and we're going to do that the night before   do what the night before   at at ron 's   the uh oh the   the rehearsal dinner   the rehearsal dinner   has uh lynne uhm uh the the or uh uh  whatever hamish and some other's name is   been in touch with lynne   yes  lynne   so that's all  that's all arranged  we don't have to worry about that   she she called me with the menu  yesterday and that was great  so we're all set with that   oh and they're going to do two head tables in the club   uhm cos she doesn't want a great long  hiccup pardon me  a long one  well now there's seven bridesmaids and seven ushers and a  that's why   i know  they wanted a wedding where they had twelve of each just not long ago  cough   when they were down here that weekend  imagine twleve  now who's her maid of honour  i thought mina   oh mina is  that's right  ya ya mina   okay   i was thinking amongst her friends and  no no no it's mina   cough   and she has stella haney now too  she's got stella as her   but not what's her name  she's not coming   no she's not coming  so i think it's going to be lovely  i'm i'm really uh  word   you excited  ya i'm beginning to be   so i have to call this lady in the hair word   so i think aside from uhm well there's always going to be a last minute collapse  suzy 's done the uhm invitations and they're  quite non-traditional  you mean she designed the designed  the the lettering   like like the whole  ya she took the whole thing and she's having   them printed and the whole thing  ya   everything   ya  oh isn't that great  it's a piece of paper folded folded   in four  you open it up   and she's not very maybe three words all the parents  how do you mean  well a few words or a business   and it's just   and their parents or something like that   oh ya   okay   oh i see  rather than names   mhh hmm mhh hmm mhh hmm  okay  cos it gets complicated with the uh the   steps and stuff  have you heard about uh uh ron coming and  well apparently he's coming but he hasn't coughed up any bread  well   promise promise promise  typical old story laugh but not a dime in the mail  anyways   his wife will never let him send it   see it as a tip  i put a down payment on  no  yes  i put t   this is the other thing  i'm gonna going to need some  maybe advance with   or get it from name   i put a ahh down payment on the dress and i've put five hundred bucks on the flowers already   that's just a down payment  mhh hmm  five hundred  mhh hmm  i figure it's quite good   against how much laugh   twenty-five hundred probably  uhm  don't forget the tablecloths  it's laugh gonna going to be obscene  so yup that's where we are   uhm   you wonder what kind of a day it's going to be eh at that time of the year with the  well whether we're going to be slobbering around in  boots and  boots and whatever  the service is six o'clock  it goes from six to six thirty   uhh we thought we'd get everybody over there and get settled and start cocktails at seven to eight thirty  she said she wanted that long   ya people won't like   that's a long time though  god  well wha wha they  have the reception line eh  well word the word    it's true eh  she doesn't want a reception line but she's going to have to have  one   oh she has to   we have we have to have  okay i'll tell her even you says  dinner at eight thirty  ya  they gonna going to have dancing at   the dinner   oh ya   oh ya  so the the club provides a band or  orchestra or   no sh hamish   has something lined up  okay  they're closing the bar at one and the club  gets closed at three  that's a good idea   and they pay uhh it's a what do you call those statutory holiday so they have to pay double  time to to the  uhh whatever to the to the  staff after midnight   one and a half   double   jeez laugh   well it's it's tough   it's still cheaper than the hotel  much  ya  and uhm i've told mel and i'll tell hamish  again too but they should disappear at twelve thirty and go and get changed   so that people it's a signal to  the you know the old types old traditional types  that won't leave until the bride goes  ya that they can go home   they can they can  come back down in their jeans if they like but they're  they're to get out of their finery and maybe   we can go home ya laugh   i figure we can go home when the bar closes  oh man  i don't know whether you want to do anything the next day  i'm not prepared to do it  i'm gonna going to be too tired but   maybe   like what   well lunch with  entertaining more  more entertaining  oh i don't know   the out-of-town visitors  uncle jim 's not coming  he called me  oh really   he he called and said he was coming and then his wife got said   there was too much on and said they'll not come  so   well it it mick and jamie   will come and   ya definitely and jack and maisy   i think and   okay   we could we could do a lunch the next day but i don't know that we neal really  need to   the out of town people we could uh   well exhale well let's think about that  i mean i think we're g we'll have   had enough frankly by that time  we will have  ya   cos that will be new year's day  ya  so you get out-of-towner people there they  a few words getting up word  i expect the kids are going to go on and on  now they're going to go to paris for their honeymoon  oh i that's what i was going to ask you  ya they've decided  they d decided   oh that's what they're going to do  mhh hmm  melanie doesn't like sitting on the beach sirens start in background   hamish would like to  so this is their   well they're not going to sit on the beach in  paris in january that's for sure   not in paris in january no no  for how long are they going for   a week or two  ya   that's all they have cos mel has class heh  she's going to miss one week of class  it's too bad mina won't be back  they could go over to switzerland and visit her there but she'll be here still   laugh   she'll be here still  oh god i gotta have got to do something about those two words   uhm i'm not going to have a corsage and neither is my mother  so we may not do corsages for anybody  but i i refuse to wear one  ya  it would look quite nice on you  in the pictures of brian's wedding  word   it was important for him because he  word listen to that  goodness what was that  fire engines   ambulances and fire and everything  else sirens stop   that's fire   no but i you know i   h hate i just don't like em  them   i think you know that  i had i had a feeling that you don't like corsages   laugh   and my mother doesn't either   and mina certainly takes after you  you take after your mother  she doesn't like them  no she doesn't like em them  either  so i'll just check with val   if she doesn't mind none of us will have them  if she wants one she can have one  ya okay   oh sure  and allison darcy will buy  allison one if she wants  sure   why should why should   i have to pay for one  if she comes   she won't let him come alone  good heavens no   so that's the wedding stuff i think  i guess i should book joni in eh for that   week here at the   yup   ya i think so  well  well you can't take her down there  nobody's going to be able to look after her then  we could leave her at kim 's place laugh  and pay for another cleaning lady  it's probably cheaper   but she's been so good here  apparently she messed the house down word    well they do that eh if it's not their own home  ohh  we went out for supper that night that i was there and there was a huge big wet spot on the carpet when we came back and i don't know whether laurie really thought it was uh   frankie   joni or frankie   she acted as if she did but she probably suspected that it was joni   joni never does that  well she word   she doesn't do it at mary 's  no but she doesn't we've never   left her alone   she doesn't do it anywhere else you take her   i mean uh uh she didn't have either of us there  it's true eh  i went to see her once in that time when i was down there  before and she went bananas  i know  you told me   and then i felt so badly leaving her i didn't go back the next time until i was leaving  leaving her   laugh   but boy you know i kept thi  thinking she wouldn't know me but she just went nuts  we had a really hard time subduing her  i'm glad brian was there  she jumped all over him   that's something you could do without at that  point  ya
