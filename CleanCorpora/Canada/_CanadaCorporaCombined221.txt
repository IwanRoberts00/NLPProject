 that's all uh mcdonald's' uhm secretary uh ray kroc's secretary in the times of high growth he would come and he wouldn't be able to pay her weekly salary because he  the business was just eating the money  and he'd word her and say i'm sorry i can't pay you this week do you mind if you take shares instead and  four or five words at the plant   and now she's a multi-millionaire as as a result of what she was getting a couple hundred dollars a week in shares which is now worth many millions of dollars  so that in a large opportunity  that's that's the things you're faced with is   is the need for cash  like the steven jobs word in the wrong business because the need for money just dilutes your ownership your control  question   sure   then you'll have a decision to make because the choice then becomes do you want to get big with the business because  there's a there's a there's a penalty  statement   you don't have any longer some control   you're no longer in charge now there's a board of directors  there's a lot of shareholders and you may have only ten percent of the business  that ten percent may be worth multi-millions of dollars but in essence in a shareholders' meeting you can't say here's what we're  gonna going to do next   comment   many of them yes they they  recycle as they call it   and so what you have is a typical ah you know business cycle  where you have from development through to growth through the maturity and decline what you'll have is if the business really starts to accelerate the entrepreneur will get off here and then come back and start a new  business and just go through the cycle over and over again  because they love the control  comment   they don't want to have it so that it becomes a big  cos once you get up in here you're talking big business  bureaucracy numerous procedures and so on and so forth  so some don't like that  and if they don't they just recycle  they make their money here   they sell the business here  and there'll be a lot of people making the offers  you bring the business  i have one word friend of mine who's excellent  at the as he calls it two million dollar companies  he says i can take a company from zero to two million dollars  after that he says i don't know what to do   he says others come in and they're good from two million to eight million   and then you have the experts from eight million and so on  but he says he's good up till two million dollars and at two million dollars he sells the company starts another one and then the people from the two million to eight million category come in and buy it off him   better he says that way he says they come in you know they put systems in place and deals and policies and so on  but not him he says i don't want to have nothing to do with that  so but this this is why in any business you've got to make decisions at each stage  and some people they just refuse to grow and just plateau   oh man i'm thinking of a few words   anybody heard of three words   a few people eh laugh   they're a hole in the wall right  humbugs laugh   ya humbug laugh   if you go through their operation you would feel/->  feel sorry for these people  the store looks like it's falling down  uh they they don't do any advertising  they sell these things internationally  and you barb my wife knows   the uh the family and she says you should see their country place and their their their huge wealth  they're humbugs  it's all run by fam the family  and they don't want anybody else in  and i said being uh the entrepreneur laugh i said you should franchise this thing you could do this you could do this and they said we don't wanna want to laugh   we're quite happy right where we are  we can take control family-owned and nobody else is involved  and we're doing quite nicely thank you very much  so you know there's an opp  the the the opportunity is there to grow and they said no we're just gonna going to stay here  that's the beauty of being in business for yourself  you decide  there's not a board of directors that comes and tells you what you have to do   so with this given this uh  how many here are entrepreneurs   alright no i like that  i like  you're you're you're word  it  you know what you're word on the other hand  see i ask you about the conformity problems that you had   a few words glasses eh  i'll ask the question  i'll say like is this li is this is it  i'll say is this green or blue  how many will say green and i'm telling you the minute  word put up their hands everybody will be two or three words before they put up their hand laugh   that's conformity  that's that's being afraid of being judged by others  if you go in business for yourself you have to avoid that  you have to just say yup or nope or decide for yourself  if everybody else looks and says boy are you ever a nut say i guess so laugh   you have to be able to shake it off uh because if you listen too much to what other people are saying or or judging you by then uh you're gonna going to have problems making it in business  based on this can anyone be an entrepreneur   yes because in essence i i i   some of them have a certain amount of a gift obviously  you might have an advantage because you're born with the gift of the gab but if you aren't born with the gift of the gab you can acquire  it or hire it laugh   you know if you're not a good sales person take a partner who is  complimentary skills  if you're good at finance never go in business with a friend   never go in business with a friend on that basis alone  if the friend has complimentary skills sure but i mean if both of you are great at marketing then one of you isn't needed   question   mhh hmm  question continues   absolutely   ya sure   question   okay well in other words if for example you wanted to go into a music career you were saying and and   you don't have you don't have the  ability to sing or play an instrument   interjection   clarifies question   okay  makes a point   oh you could be  sure yes   in that much the same way as you see in flea markets many people with a lot of skills or crafts  they're very good with woodwork or whatever and they   they have that gift let's say that that   they develop and use and they they sell it  they they word for market   question   yes  question continues   oh i see   ya sure   question continues   yes you're a consultant dentist doctor these are entrepreneurs who are limited by a twenty-four hour clock  in other words you're always you're  limited by how many hours there are in a day unless you can clone yourself  makes a point   uh no that's right   cos in a lot of uh it may be more of a factor when you're buying a business  when people go to buy a business you have to be careful because a lot of times the whole of the business is based on the personality of the owner  and so in other words all kinds of customers coming into the store and everything is going gangbusters the person better watch it that this guy didn't like get all his friends and relatives to come in and a few words   a few words that didn't happen  even so when you buy the business all of a sudden nobody comes anymore because old joe whoever owned the business before he knew everybody by their first name they knew him and so a few word know you   so you can lose business on that  and you're right if you have a skill or a gift and you are in business then you have to find a way to duplicate yourself in some way shape or form train others teach others develop a standardized system  automate whatever so that you eliminate your de de  dependancy of the business on you question and answer exchange between speaker a and multiple extra-corpus speakers, 30 sec.  the other ones that are excellent at that in a local vein is ben and jerry's  ben and jerry's is a super family for getting publicity getting their name in the paper with no charge   you know  the the identity you notice that  two word you notice in hollywood they're always doing some weird thing or or another to always get their names in the paper and so ben and jerry's is super at that cos it costs them zero  so when ben and jerry's was growing and they got to this stage here and they started to lose money because ben and jerry were still running it and the business had gotten beyond entrepreneurial management  you know what they did  they ad they advertised for a c e o chi uh chief executive officer bring in professional management do you know how they did it audience response   they had an word   they had laugh wild two word ben and jerry  ben is as crazy as a bed bug  he's saying he'd go to a you you  go to a professional executive placement agency and you hire a c e o that's you know goes through the assessments and the tests and all the rest of it  they went on this weird route let let  me tell you  every paper across north america carried these looney toons  and you know what they ended up hiring a c e o who had the credentials but in the meantime they got tonnes of publicity for free  that's that's the beauty   that's marketing  that's that's a marketing genius   okay let's move it on  if we can be comfortable with the idea that anybody can be an entrepreneur it's just a question of having the passion having the desire having the vision and not allowing anybody else to knock you off the track  and not allowing yourself to knock yourself off the track  you can be your own worst enemy  you can beat yourself worse than anybody else now  you can you can rip yourself worse than any of your enemies  you know behaving yourself saying i will not do any  about three words dah dah dah dah dah dah and now  you gotta have got to learn how to motivate yourself be your best friend because when you get into entrepreneurship you've got nobody there holding your hand saying that's okay you'll be alright   there's no training program for entrepreneurs   you're never going to go into into a situation and learn to be an entrepreneur  nobody's going to teach you because then you're the competitor  i've worked for three entrepreneurs in my life   all of them very well off  none of them had money   interesting  no entrepreneur and i'm talking multi-millionaires none of them had money  they're be bumming coffees off me and cigarettes because all their money was tied up back in the business back in the business  they had no cash  these people were very successful  did they teach me how to be an entrepreneur  not on your life  it's called here i am if you want to try and learn from me watch me and follow me or do what you want but there's no way they're going to hold your hand and say here's how you do it laugh   so there's no training ground  you know if you go in to be anything a plumber a carpenter if you go into ah uh a computer situation you're going to have somebody teaching you the skills  as an entrepreneur they're not going to teach you the skills  you're gonna going to have to learn them on your own  so let's assume everybody can be an entrepreneur  you've got a vision a direction  you're not allowing yourself to be swayed off track  then the question becomes is where's the opportunity what's the idea where do we find the good idea  and very few had to be fun and guts    in other words it has to be fun has to be something you like to do or otherwise you'll get bored with it or you won't you won't even want to spend the time on it
