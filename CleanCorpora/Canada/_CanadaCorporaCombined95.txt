like cos that was classic  i i had a my dean actually had a  near brush with mono mononucleosis   yeah  she had this flu bug that uh was having her sleepy in twenty hours out of twenty-four  hmm  and so she went home to stay which is very nice because apparently if you work yourself too hard it turns out   into full blown pronounced belowin mono  mono mononucleosis   mm  which is not nice to have especially just start of like finals laugh   ah   yeah  that does not help at all heavy intake of breath   anyway so i see you're going to pronounced 'goina' grey cup  well maybe   maybe maybe maybe

each other on the phone  ah ha  it's so cutesy and romantic  yeah it is it's great  laugh   probably sitting there waiting to be delivered  laugh   oh yeah   it's like my recycled envelopes  oh yeah well   i catch a lot of flak for those  from who  everyone  i go into the library and i say can i have some   can i rummage in your recycling bin for a sec and they all look at me funny  laugh   and i take one or two of the envelope things  mumbled sentence   we should actually find a few of those because i've got to uh send pictures of my little brothers to my grandparents and they're  kinda kind of big  laugh   huh  have to be pretty big pictures to need those envelopes  well   only the medium-size ones  they don't need the like it's not full eight by eleven you know   incredible portrait size  word   you can put this up on your t v and just you know   no it's my legs are sore  can you guys hear me talking in there  guess not   word we   i was cos i'm recording this now  and i wanted to know like if it came out through the speaker in the family room  is everyone gonna going to hear us  no no   i know i had kraft dinner now where is it   there it is   ohh   sigh   do you only have two final exams  mm hmm  oh lucky you  hey   well the next semester after that i have three  i have four caroline   and then after i have four  okay i knew i thought  i had beans  now where in the hell are they   you having beans and macaroni  well i'm not gonna going to eat all the macs macaroni   kay okay i guess i don't have any beans  oh well i'm havin having  macs macaroni   i can't have macs macaroni i've no milk  so get some  yeah but i'm on the phone with you which means sigh  i can't do both at the same time  get somebody else to go  well no we've decided to stop sharing milk  why  cos i'm the one that drinks the most and jessie  wants to go back to drinking two percent and stephanie hardly drinks any so   stef's not gonna going to  drink any milk at all i'm gonna going to have my milk and jess's gonna going to have her milk  uhh   oh i see  yeah  five mumbled words   yeah  kay okay oh i don't have p  oh yes i do  okay  for mom and dad for their stockings and for christmas presents  do you have yo their lists there or do you want me to go get mine  uhh  one second  i'm writing notes at the same time as we're talking  laugh   notes that i've missed  uhm   well i have it here  kay okay   actually i made i had some ideas for mom for her stocking  well the stocking i'm gonna going to   put socks and stuff  well this is like a communal effort isn't it  yeah put socks  uhh  and that uh basting brush thing that she was talking  bout about but you didn't know what what  what it was  yeah yeah i know what it is now  but yeah  uhm what other uh like  vaseline and like ah portable things for when she's skiing  okay   what about dad too  yes   get dad one too   yeah   like a chapstick though for dad cos he doesn't like vaseline  yeah  i was sitting in history class thinking about this  laugh   uhm and i was thinking of getting like exercise socks for dad  yeah that's good  uhm i came up with another  oh yeah at school there imaginus poster and print store  is there  oh yeah  and what about getting like a little monet print for mom  they're just five bucks  yeah  kay okay   that's good   ah-kay okay   uh my elbow   you have to start doing online shopping  i haven't done any yet  i haven't done any  i've been looking around though like  yeah  i haven't even done that laugh   unclear mumble   uhm would you wanna want to  what sh are we gonna get like   communal presents for mom for christmas and just split it all  after  i dunno don't know what do you think  that's probably the best idea  yeah  like what did what did she r     i don't have the list in front of me so what did she really want  word   we can prob you know we can probably stick candles in her stocking  yeah  okay mommy's list  uhm socks off-white turtleneck  kay okay   uhm i can buy the off-white turtleneck for  myself at fifty percent off at the  gap   sh   she didn't like them  she doesn't  well she said they were too expensive for the quality  it's what she said  but i don't know where else we can get them  i'm sure actually places all over have turtlenecks  mm hmm   but that's probably the best idea cos then   she wanted poison perfume  well kay okay the  the poison and the l'air du temps we'll get from dad  what do you mean dad will get her  yeah like it'll be from dad  co cos it's  it's a fortune caroline   okay she wants black  stretch pants  that's it  that's it   and candles   and candles   oh boy  so we can get her everything  yeah  well why don't we get her then either the l   poison or the l'air du temps and dad'll get her the other one  okay  and do you wanna want to  stick to stretch pants in the stocking as well
