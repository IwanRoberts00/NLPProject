 so there's that level you can look at it on  at that time though if you had looked at this painting if you looked it all over uhm your eye would li light  up here in this niche and you would realize this was a  vanitas or a memento mori   these are two terms that are that are used to describe a painting that it is really ah a reminder of death  that's what it is about  and you see these things  you see them in uh uhm  there's often a skull  a skull is a is a vanitas  symbol  ah a snuffed candle is a vanitas symbol  a bouquet of flowers is because the flowers are are  are fresh today but they're gonna going to wilt and die tomorrow  often there are a couple of flowers that have already fallen or some insects that are in the flowers  uh even the the pages up there  uh are an indication of this idea  it's and and the message is no matter how great your learning is no matter how well-read you are you we're all going to come to the same end  and there so there is this moral message  that that is there  there's also a political message and that is partly in this  music that the old lady is holding partly probably in this jester up here who is the artist  it's s self-portrait of the artist  and he's pointing to three birds that are caged  and this all refers to the political situation   uh flanders was under the yoke of spain  flanders was protestant  uhm they were trying to get out from under the yoke uh uh  of of spain uhh but uh uhh were not  and this refers to a huguenot song  uh i'm not just sure what the reference is but some sort of song that the soldiers sang   this up here probably is a reminder that uhm these birds are singing but they're in a cage  you people are having a good time you're eating and drinking and having music but you're you're caged  you're not free  so there's ah there there's a lot  and there's there's a lot more in the painting  it's chucked full of symbolism ***yes: chucked***  i'm not going to go into it cos we don't have time   okay  agrees tape cuts out   i think what stands out about it are the colours uh in it  we thought when it came in here that some of us thought that it had just been cleaned but it hadn't  that is the colouring in that is due to the fact that reni used uhm white undercoat  and uh most of the paintings in this room had  would start from a dark uh underpainting and paint up from that  he started from white and the and the  white glows through the uh the draperies and the flesh and everything and it's uh  that of course is uh uhm europa and and  jupiter the rape of europa tape cuts out   uh a rembrandt here that is one of uhm   o one one of rembrandt's fine works   and this also is esther probably  it's never been clear who she is  when it first came here sh she  it was called the jewish bride  then it was uh called susanna  it's now hailing from the old testament uh esther or bathsheba  well there are reasons to think that it's not bathsheba  there are reasons to  well it's hard to say but/-> but i  i think the current uhm idea among most people is that this is esther  the same esther that we saw out there going to the king  and that this is the moment when she has made up her mind that she's going to go to the king risk her life and a   ask that he uh lift this edict  uh the bible says that she spent three days in fasting and uh whatever and then she got herself dressed into a fine garment  and she had a handmaiden uh do her hair uh and and  off she went  and this it's thought that this is the moment that's pictured here  she's dressed in her velvet and with the gold trim and the beautiful  and it gives rembrandt you know the opportunity to paint this light uhm the the the contrast with the dark that he always has the dark background and then the light coming in from the left to pick up what he wants you to see  the the face a  and the the dips of her dress and particularly this hand because she's going through a great deal of inner turmoil  and the hand can be read to indicate uh you know this  this uh decision that she is in the process of making   and and how upsetting the whole thing is  uhm because rembrandt is coming up to the period where he's going to do the psych the the psychological  content in his paintings  the later rembrandt is is is uh has   a lot of psychological penetration in in uh  the the paintings and the portraits that he does  and so in her face you see some of this hesitation and this  indecision  uhm as you look at it you see more and more coming out of the background as you usually do  a table here with word on it   papers here that are  if you if you m if you accept this as esther the papers would be the edict that the king has  has signed   uhm and the handmaiden doing her  now this is something i didn't mention in the other room but this is another one of these vanitas symbols  the ages of life  in there there was an baby a young woman and an old woman  and wherever you see that combination it's this vanitas  thing  you know that as you as the baby  is it will grow older and and  it will grow old  and wherever you see this kind of a of a   combination a young woman and and the old face in the background that's probably a a a   vanitas   and the emphasis on the hand here because the important thing about that woman is that she's doing esther's hair  it's the hand that's important  so all these little things that that  rembrandt sounds like yelling in background puts into a painting but ahh   but just makes it uh so superb  and more dutch paintings in this room  another one here by nicolaes maes who was a pupil of rembrandt's  a woman making lace  ah a very uhm exhale breath   a a rush a dutch   uh housewife who is very uh frugal  her money bags are here  her books are open  she's making lace  she's making money  it's it's all uh  uhm and the light again is is coming in from the left to pick up the woman and the books the kinds of things that you're supposed to to concentrate on  and then some of the the landscapes here of word with those great skies the cloudscapes that the seventeenth century dutch did and that influenced uhm  oh people i impressionists uh uh proto-impressionists   constable also did did did skies like that  i keep forgetting tape cuts out   and we have canaletto here  we have a guardi over there  we have a couple bellottos   these people were known as view painters   they did views of venice  this was the time of the grand tour when the sons of the wealthy uhm particularly british wealthy went off on extended trips after their education  went all through europe  uhm it was the beginning of tourism when other people were traveling  venice was always a place uh that people wanted to go because of the atmosphere because of the water because of the buildings  and they wanted souvenirs like modern tourists do and so eh ah a a whole occupation almost came into being providing these view uh view painters  view view scenes   ah canaletto was the most popular of them  he did a number of l large ones  uh he also did small ones that people could take  they could commission them uh while they were there   so i think when you go into that transition okay i'm just gonna going to finish up with these little points here  when you're gonna going to go into that transition from traditional teaching to know the rules of the game  okay we start teaching know what it's into coo  cooperative uh the communicative  approach cooperative learning at these very fascinating these reasons that make you interested in e s l because it is fascinating you know  it's it's dynamic   that make you wanna want to get into that compared to the old traditional style   the tradition okay tra   transition   you have to do it only once you have the traditional  teaching in place   you understand what i mean   it is only when it works in your class that the discipline problems uh the big you know g class management is is settled that you will be able to start uh in more going more   towards commu the uh  communicative approach   you know why   why do you think that is  why do you think that would work   audience member responds   yes  audience member continues   okay   audience member continues   right  audience member continues   well i've used others too   audience member continues   it's not necessarily flight no  word   audience member continues   mm hmm  audience member asks a question   well the idea for example of vocabulary   audience member continues   well you know the example of of  starting with with not much uh team work uh working in a in a very structural kind of way of vocabulary grammar  audience member responds   audience member comments   study   audience member agrees   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right right  audience member comments   audience member agrees   audience member comments   right  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   definitely  you definitely can do it other ways  audience member agrees   that's for sure  that's not what i'm trying to question  you definitely can do it other ways  audience member comments   right  audience member comments   exactly   establish the rules and also have the trust of your students   okay that's what you want  you want the trust   you want them to go he's a teacher   okay that's that's what i'm trying to establish   that they go   cos you're you're a new teacher  you're new  see i want you to do the students to go  oh he knows the rules of the game  he knows how to teach okay  he knows how to give homework  he knows how to give tests   that's what i want you to do   and then you can start doing more interesting things   me it's music okay  for example me i use a lot of music  you you might want to do something else  you might do something else   you might do something else <,?  but you have to find it   and you have to develop it   and that's when it starts to become interesting   that's when that's when you get through the idea of uh of just being a traditional teacher and you start being yourself as a teacher  and that's when it becomes interesting   and that's what you want  audience member asks a question   i use it in many ways  i use it as uh for example with the uh  i use it a lot in in uh tsk  just in reading  with this you you come in and the song is on the table   and i ask the students to circle the words that they understand  tsk and then we'll sing the song together  and that's it   and then we'll start doing other activities  we'll start working on other activities  then i'll come and word some other class with words missing you know the old the words missing in the song and they have to listen to the song  audience member comments   and then that's it for that   and then we'll just sing   and then i might do something else where i take the song and now we're gonna going to practise really singing the song and you know that kind of thing  i did a really interesting an well uh activity i found quite good is uh with secondary three is uh they all  chose their own songs   and we listen to a song on a tape   they they have the artist  and then they give their opinion of the words of the song  they give their opinion of the music of the song  and how the song makes them feel  it was a song uh thing about feelings   so i made used that kind of thing   uh that's a good activity because they chose those songs     audience member asks something   you this is what i what i'm say  yeah what i'm trying to to uh  exp explain   this is the last point of what i want to tell you   okay that which for me is really important   is that if you don't get this trust going this first  trust in the first beginning   if you don't show that you're a competent teacher   if you don't know the rules of the game you're never going to teach the communicative approach in my opinion  the students might be in groups   the students might be doing activities   but the communicative approach is very difficult to teach  and it's not easy  it's not it's not hmm   i think a lot of people throw around the term and they don't really study it  it's it's something you have to study  to to uh to understand  and once you do it and you go and you start being  word   that's all i want to say   if there's any more questions   laugh audience laughter       audience member comments   audience member comments   yeah yeah   laugh audience laughter     audience member thanks guest speaker   audience applause   laugh audience laughter     audience member continues commenting   audience member agrees   yeah thank you for coming   i do uh appreciate that a lot  audience member says something   thanks
