 ya  and uh they start mentioning it every once in a while  you'll see uh basically it's usually whenever there's an accident with the trams suddenly this becomes this uhh uh really big issue  mhh hmm   uh every time we have an accident   oh really because they've got untrained drivers or   exactly exactly  and it's all their fault  and here we have   what what about  prostitution though  what are they blaming that on   oh well that was a big issue eh in the forties  i mean it actual would fact  it it lead to the the rise of  mayor drapeau because he was the lawyer  mhh hmm   remember he's a young lawyer  i told you  he's saving that fifteen-year-old who's  going to be executed for a murder   yes   mhh hmm   uh he ends up uh taking this as kind of like ah ah  single-handedly he becomes a crusader  he closes down all the prostitute  there was a lot of there was a red light district  with a lot of of basic houses of prostitution and this was seen as a big issue  mhh hmm   there's actually a series in french   they had a running series  what was it called  op open  montreal open city   i think it was an eight ser   series mini-series and it's drama based on this whole  problem of prostitution and  and   drama   oh yes   in the thirties  the thirties and forties  hmm  and actually i think it was more in the forties  cos in the thirties he's very young  hmm   so he made his name basically closing down the red light district  hmm  ah very famous  but it was like it was a business  it was a very lucrative business   mhh hmm   and it was like you know i mean it's a lot of poverty so it  was seemed as a a  viable option for young women  you know in this in this   situation   hmm   mhh hmm   nothing to do with dis   disintegration of the family though   no   i've never read anything about prostitution  oh ya   although i'm not far up where you are  but   well the protestants just seem to   english protestants just seem to ignore the whole situation   cos it's not   it's not even an issue in any of this  ya   mhh  they may be using prostitutes but  they're certainly not ya prostitutes  themselves   mhh   i've never seen any headlines   mhh   it's a ba basically a french canadian phenomena  mhh  and it goes back to the prohibition era actually where  montreal was still wet where the rest of canada was dry  and so and the united states so everybody would come to montreal  yes   mhh hmm   and it was called sin city  mhh hmm   it was known as sin city  and so prostitution flourished because you had this uh underground culture  mhh hmm  i mean with fifty percent unemployment in the depression   you know it was like an option  mhh hmm   i mean you could be a prostitute   mhh hmm   you could make money and  and it still has a reputation of being a a  uh city where there's there's no closing hour and it's a got a wild side to it in terms of its reputation as opposed to what it  really laugh really  is   that's right   ya laugh yes   ya   ya and this is uh of course typically we have two  important articles  ya   here's the affair of the tramway  they are arguing about the brotherhood of the thing or are  going to have this big conference  oh yes   and so it's still an issue you know here on the  what is it the sixteenth of february nineteen  forty-five   mhh hmm   so it's been like a year as far as i can tell   mhh hmm   and uh here we have uhm it's just a picture without any article uhm uhm about this fire this horrible fire that happened in maine bangor  maine   mhh hmm   mhh hmm   is it bangor  yes bangor   yardbourne yup  there's been this huge fire and sixteen children were killed  so we have several reports of this  oh my goodness   ya and it's really kind of fuel for the anti-   garderies quebec french: daycare centre eh cos  here's a garderie burnt down  institutions   sixteen kids inside   you mean this was a garderie   mhh hmm ya   oh my goodness   word this  here's here's   now the next day cos i guess that was a last minute thing and they just kind of stuck that picture in  here's the next day front page   oh my   so now they've got like some real fuel   this is the same   ya it's the same thing  that's just a picture that appears one time and the next day we have this this uh real follow-up on it  so i get the feeling the fire happened  they weren't quick enough to be able to write a story  about it but put in the picture in anyways  yes   am i correct in thinking that this   originally you were referring to maine  so this is in montreal   ya that's ri right    no no no  the fire is not in montreal  that's what i thought at first but if you read the article  it's in maine  okay   so here was no   we don't have any article going along with this  no but it does say a fire in a  garderie   and they're referring to garderie   word word   burn  ya   and ya uh i that was my initial thing  oh this is   and in french   french names   yes  i thought oh this is this is in montreal  and then the next day when you read this article then you start to realize uhm   oh all right   maine  ya  auburn  auburn sorry  i thought it was bangor   okay i was looking over here but this is another fire  in a convent   no this is another fire in montreal ya  it's actually it's a convent which was on laval chaterre uhm which was like a historical site  mhh  but ya it doesn't really  it it ya initially you think oh ya they're connected  it's not   incredible  okay well that would make anyone think twice about  daycare if uhm   putting their kid   we have seventeen actually who died  one must have died during the night  ya  it was like real   from three months to six years   huh   terrible  i've never heard about that fire   ya i know   it it was a big thing  i'm interested to see what brenna comes when she gets to that date  uh here we have in the latest january nineteen forty-five  uh still great demand for women in war  and d i love this  women young women less than sixty years of age please apply   hmm   i think no wonder they had to create   why aren't they in school   ya no kidding huh  so these are at working for the tobacco  ya imperial tobacco which is still there  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   but i just thought that was really striking  i mean no wonder they needed social reform because i mean you know they're asking in the paper   for you to drop out of school   mhh hmm   they got down to fifteen year old girls  now   ya   they exhausted all the other potential employees  ya   ya  that's interesting  okay here's the uh more tramway on the tramway debate   and these come up you know sort of  sporadically  mhh hmm   there's interest and then they seem to forget about it  at times you think the strike's over because you haven't heard of it so long and then suddenly you'll hear ah  mhh hmm mhh hmm   is there anything about the strike in the english press  brenna   i i actually did come across one didn't i michel   ya  the tramway   now i can't remember wh   where   ya  in the downtown   we were looking at it weren't we  ya  do you remember what article  mhh  it was in word   no it was just it was on   it was funny because it wasn't for that you had gotten it  did i throw it away   no i did  did i did i did i throw it away  no you kept it  it's still there somewhere  no but   here it is   no   ya  strike sidelines   irate tram users displayed row use broken windows as entrance   that's terrible  mhh  so the the strike is still going on  uh huh   and uh mumbles   irate tram users are they mad because of the  schedule not being kept or  mhh   does it mention   no   hmm   ya here we have this committee for the  to help children and i i'm  still not quite sure if it has anything to do with those   that that massive influx of articles or if this is yet another organization  mhh   i'm not sure  it looks different  it does doesn't it  that looks like the medical seal or the seal for the  the pediatric uhm associ  association or pediatric whatever they're called  of america   ya   little baby in swaddling   hmm i'll look at it carefully  this international organization   hmm and they talk about delinquency   that's all they talk about in the newspaper  seem more focusing on delinquency in the  newspapers   laugh   all the time   ya   uh here this is interesting  this is the last day of the european war  mhh hmm  and i just thought it was interesting cos there's still so much request for female work  and this is like may fifth nineteen forty-five the day   the germans surrender  so i thought it's sort of historically significant that on that day there's still massive amounts of work wanted  mhh hmm   mhh hmm   mhh hmm  at least for the short term until the men start returning  ya   imperial tobacco was still on the foremost  ya   ya  uh here's an article about uh women and feminism and their kind of you know uhm sort of ex explaining their   point of view that's word but at the same time sort of uh  i don't know  i feel it's almost like a mockery  it's uh not overt but it seems to be an underlying  disdain for these women feminists you  know   mhh   mhh   what does re  reine ah queen reine aux es  cla ves sounding out word   queen queen of slaves   queen of slaves  ya   so it's like uhm you know it seems to be  that's kind of radical  and i think that's what the speakers are saying but uh just the article seems to be i don't know kind of a   a one-sided thing  mhh hmm   here we have this  uh remember the the the daycare in the train station for women and the women just keep on coming in with their families  oh yes   mhh hmm   which is turning out to be the most highly-visible   daycare service when really it's just such a special  interest special use thing  one or two days while they uhm decide on which train to catch or just to give them a layover time before moving on  highly-visible right   i know but we're constantly seeing it   that's right  this uh kind of goes it ties in with the rest of the stuff  this is an ah a later article about the province and their uh new new approach   and their new costs and   oh yes   mhh hmm  and this is just kind of ah an aside but it's a picture of  a daycare in a garderie in china  oh peculiar   and they're just kind of   ya  they just kind of say look there's a garderie  in china  all of a sudden this pops up  it doesn't say  now was it visited by <,, someone from quebec  laugh no   that's right  just kind of like there it is  it does   word must be a model  daycare or something   ya uh   it talks about the daycare uhm being part of services for women under the ministry of education as if this would be   as if it would be a model almost for quebec but as it turns out uhm  it wasn't   ya   ya and i was wondering on a conspiracy theory  that they're anti- garderies   they may be saying you know look at these savages you know  they're laugh they're doing that and we we we're above that  why   it's actually presented in a positive light though  ya ya it is  but it's funny because it's so disassociated isn't it  it is   it's just this picture with a little  caption and it seems to have nothing   we rarely have world news in the paper   i mean of that kind  ya
