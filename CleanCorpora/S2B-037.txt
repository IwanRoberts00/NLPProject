Festivals are  rightly said to be the living history of a
nation 
""
They are inextricably linked 
philosophy and literature 
""
And are thus connected with the innocent of man 
""
India is a unique country in the sense  that it has such a large
number of festivals  which have become living traditions of a unique
nature 
""
They carry rhythm  the entire story of the growth of our culture
""
""
So much so  to single
out an incident or factor  associated with a particular Indian festival
""
""
 that a particular caste
or section of society  for a particular
festival 
""
 one of such unique festivals
""
""
""
""
It is celebrated  Shravan
""
""
""
A very old name of this festival  Rishi tarpan
""
""
On this particular day  Brahmins used to put on new sacred
threads 
""
The rituals of  and the
heads of  around
the wrists of the people 
""
Subsequently  as
""
""
As said earlier  quite a few stories are associated with this
festival 
""
One of them reminds us 
king Bali  treta yug
""
""
Bali took a vow  and ruling over the
entire universe 
""
He went to his  bid to him
his compliments 
""
""
with a holy  and a sacred thread
 this made Bali
strong 
""
He wiped out his enemies  and became the supreme power in the
universe 
""
During the later feudal ages  the kings and warriors used to
obtain this sacred  gurus
 before going out to the
battle fields 
""
Gradually  and then a public
festival 
""
Even today  can be heard chanting
 ten twam
manbadrami rakshe ma chal ma chal 
""
Which means  with which
""
your protection may be sure 
""
Well  that when the demons
attacked 
""
Before he set out 
tilak 
raksha sutra 
which made Indra unconquerable on the battle field 
""
Even during the Rajput period  wives used
to send off their husbands to the battle fields in the same manner  after
tying the 
""
Subsequently  sisters
started tying this sacred  around their
brothers wrists 
""
And the whole thing got converted  into the modern festival of
""
""
Despite these changes  the
importance of the sacred thread has stayed 
""
This thread  whether a
 or wives gallant
husband 
""
Even people from outside Indian context  have been influenced
by the holy feelings 
""
When Alexander came to India  he perchanced saw an Indian woman
""
""
Surprised when he asked her what she had done  and when she told
him  he requested the woman to tie the
""
""
And she gladly did so 
""
Similarly the great mughal emperor Humayun  stood against the
muslim ruler of Gujarat  the queen of
Chittor  rakhi
""
""
In fact  has
been a unique Indian tradition  and all
the sections of the Indian society 
""
Any man feels proud of the holy thread  his sister puts on his
wrist 
""
In the present context  the thread puts the burden of the
sisters protection 
""
In this way  has acquired a new
social meaning 
""
But the tradition goes on  restoring a gleam of
fresh love  on
this unique day 
""
""
""
Some time ago  I
don't remember now in whose  and I
have my 
""
To my mind the statement  acquired
the value of a powerful platitude 
""
All the honourable members of the fraternity  of the henpecked
 that a married man can do anything he likes
 because freedom is compulsory for him
""
""
He must enjoy this freedom  when his mistress is favourably
inclined after all the labours of love and household 
""
After all as Arnold Banard declared long ago  being a husband
is a whole time job 
every worker is entitled to personal freedom and entertainment 
""
Of course without any detrement to his marital duties of all sorts
""
""
What he says is also occasionally listened to and honoured by his
wife 
""
He has no cause to mourn  if she sometime discards his proposals
or even dictates 
""
Isn't she his better-half  obviously therefore she often gets
better of him 
""
Thus  and whatever she
misses 
""
She frankly admits  that there are two sides to every question
""
""
Precisely for this reason  and she
disposes 
""
It is a matter of common knowledge that the greatest philosophers
 have seen the tyranny of their
wives 
""
Plato and Aristotle ruled the world in their own way  but could
seldom have their own way  that the
road to success is sealed with women pushing their husbands along 
""
Isn't their belief upheld by history  ?
""
Who made Kalidas one of the greatest poets and playrights of the
world  ?
""
Who pushed Tulsi to the world of immortality  and undying fame
 ?
""
Modern poets are not less obliged to their mistresses and wives for
experiencing  their
literary output with this ennobled sweet melancholy 
""
 throat a number of
sweetest songs that tell of saddest thought 
""
I pity Dryden who couldn't realise how unjust he was  when he
suggested 
""
He suggested his epitaph for her grave 
""
 now she is at
rest 
""
Even today such a sick exclamation can sometime be heard somewhere
""
""
Generals and great politicians are no exceptions to this general
observation 
""
One day when a grocer complained about Mrs  burst
of temper  laid a
comforting hand on the 
Can you not stand for fifteen minutes  what I have stood for fifteen years
""
""
Well  The time heals all
wounds 
""
Although he had to ignore another significant fact in order to keep
his cool 
""
This would explain Charles Haddons Pergent humble supplication 
god  in the
street  devils
""
""
We must give them their due  ?
""
With sincere apologies to Oscar Wilde it can be said  that the
only way to get rid of a  is to yield to
it 
""
All you need in this life  wife's
""
""
You must drive out from your life all superstitions  like
science and medicines 
""
As George Bernard Shaw would put it  Because a woman
cannot put up with these unhealthy things 
""
A woman is like an empire 
""
She makes quick decisions  and doesn't
think you are safe when you are out 
""
In these things as in most others  wit is
often better than a  is often at
his 
""
It must not be however concluded that I am a misogynist 
""
Far from it 
""
Although some left balanced male thinkers  describe a balanced
woman as one with a narrow waist and a broad mind 
""
I do not subcribe to this view 
""
 even today
women do not enjoy as much lead of freedom as men do  but women are not
handicapped on account of this legal flaw 
""
Thanks to the generosity of nature  they are blessed with so
much of irresistible natural power  that no discriminatory laws can harm
them 
""
However  there seems to be some gross misunderstanding among
some misguided husbands  who recently formed an association in New Delhi
""
""
I don't understand this 
have not yet taken to husband battering 
""
They do and probably justifiably so assert that an ideal wife would
be any woman who has an ideal husband 
""
This however raises a very feeble doubt in my mind  that whoever
it was  didn't
know much about justice 
""
I hope my wife isn't listening to me now 
""
Sometimes my doubting nature drives me to think that any fool can
have  and so any wife can
drive even the most sensible husband to desperation  by just using a
disasterous word 
""
I think 
in which she disposes as soon as he proposes 
""
The  genius is the first factor that makes her avert
to her 
""
Do not therefore pity the unsuccessful lover of a women of genius
""
""
Save your sympathy for the man who marries her  because not
before long  all is real and imaginary weaknesses and failures puts spread
in the world 
""
In such cases  but
go to the extent of disposing him off 
""
Nearly the same thing holds good about women who are uncommonly
beautiful 
""
Such a beautiful wife 
poet husband's  but may even venture to edit him personally
""
""
An ugly duckling might not display such a fiendish talent  and
other invitation to a possible catastrophe may result from marrying a woman
with relation 
""
There may be extremely successful people in society because of
their wealth power or excellences in some art 
""
The wife would tend to pity her husband 
secretly  she would
spontaneously reprimand her husband directly or indirectly  for being an
inferior soul 
""
Finally  indiscreet and total submission
to his better half  usually corrupts and converts her into his bitter
half 
""
The husband must realise  who
will turn 
""
If he runs after her  if
he even pretend to move away from her 
""
Anyway  as
you are on the surest way to greatness 
""
Behind every man  but
quite naturally
