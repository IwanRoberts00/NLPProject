Festivals are rightly said to be the living history of a
nation 
They are inextricably linked with the culture religion 
philosophy and literature of a people 
And are thus connected with the innocent of man 
India is a unique country in the sense that it has such a large
number of festivals which have become living traditions of a unique
nature 
They carry rhythm the entire story of the growth of our culture
 mostly in a condensed form 
So much so that it has become almost impossible to single
out an incident or factor associated with a particular Indian festival
 It's equally futile now to say that a particular caste
or section of society is primarily responsible for a particular
festival in the modern context 
 Raksha Bandhan is one of such unique festivals
 of our country 
 It's a cultural festival of the Aryan race 
It is celebrated on the full moon day of Shravan
 and that is why it is also called Shravani 
A very old name of this festival is Rishi tarpan
 also 
On this particular day Brahmins used to put on new sacred
threads or a one word 
The rituals of yadnya were performed and the
heads of ashramas tied sacred yellow thread around
the wrists of the people while chanting vedic hymns 
Subsequently this thread itself came to be known as
 Raksha Bandhan or Rakhi 
As said earlier quite a few stories are associated with this
festival 
One of them reminds us of the great daitya 
king Bali living long long before Ram in the treta yug
 
Bali took a vow of defeating Indra and ruling over the
entire universe including swarg lok 
He went to his guru Shukracharya bid to him
his compliments and sought his blessings 
 Daitya guru Shukra gave his blessings to Bali 
with a holy tilak on his forehead and a sacred thread
 or raksha sutra around his wrist this made Bali
strong and invincible on the battle field 
He wiped out his enemies and became the supreme power in the
universe 
During the later feudal ages the kings and warriors used to
obtain this sacred raksha sutra from their gurus
 purohits or other Brahmins before going out to the
battle fields 
Gradually it became an annual ritual and then a public
festival 
Even today a purohit can be heard chanting
 yen badhwa Bali raja danvendra mahabalaha ten twam
manbadrami rakshe ma chal ma chal 
Which means I tie you with the sacred thread with which
 daitya raj Bali was tied by his guru 
your protection may be sure and firm 
Well there goes another story that when the demons
attacked Indira's kingdom he prepared to fight them out 
Before he set out his queen Shachi put the sacred 
tilak on his forehead and the sacred thread the 
raksha sutra or rakhi on his right wrist 
which made Indra unconquerable on the battle field 
Even during the Rajput period history tells us wives used
to send off their husbands to the battle fields in the same manner after
tying the raksha sutra to their wrists 
Subsequently we do not know exactly when and how sisters
started tying this sacred raksha bandhan around their
brothers wrists 
And the whole thing got converted into the modern festival of
 raksha bandhan 
Despite these changes in the form of the ritual the
importance of the sacred thread has stayed 
This thread has always been reminding man whether a
 gurus deciple or sisters brother or wives gallant
husband or any other common man of his obligations 
Even people from outside Indian context have been influenced
by the holy feelings inspired by this sacred thread 
When Alexander came to India he perchanced saw an Indian woman
 offering a sacred thread to a river on this particular day 
Surprised when he asked her what she had done and when she told
him the significance of this ritual he requested the woman to tie the
 sutra to his wrist also 
And she gladly did so 
Similarly the great mughal emperor Humayun stood against the
muslim ruler of Gujarat in order to protect Karmavati the queen of
Chittor who sent the raksha sutra or rakhi
 to him and requested him to protect his sister 
In fact this festival of raksha bandhan has
been a unique Indian tradition cutting across all the ages and all
the sections of the Indian society 
Any man feels proud of the holy thread his sister puts on his
wrist and does everything within his power to protect her honour 
In the present context the thread puts the burden of the
sisters protection on the brother 
In this way raksha bandhan has acquired a new
social meaning and a new social purpose 
But the tradition goes on and on restoring a gleam of
fresh love and assurance in the eyes of brothers and sisters on
this unique day 
Some time ago I saw in some friend's house I
don't remember now in whose I am the master of this house and I
have my wife's permission to say so 
To my mind the statement is has acquired
the value of a powerful platitude 
All the honourable members of the fraternity of the henpecked
 would probably assert that a married man can do anything he likes
 if his wife doesn't mind it because freedom is compulsory for him
He must enjoy this freedom when his mistress is favourably
inclined after all the labours of love and household 
After all as Arnold Banard declared long ago being a husband
is a whole time job and as per the globally accepted labour laws 
every worker is entitled to personal freedom and entertainment 
Of course without any detrement to his marital duties of all sorts
What he says is also occasionally listened to and honoured by his
wife who is very gifted that is young and beautiful 
He has no cause to mourn if she sometime discards his proposals
or even dictates 
Isn't she his better-half obviously therefore she often gets
better of him and his arguments 
Thus what she hits becomes history and whatever she
misses remains mystery 
She frankly admits that there are two sides to every question
 her own and the wrong side 
Precisely for this reason very often he proposes and she
disposes 
It is a matter of common knowledge that the greatest philosophers
 poets administrators and rulers have seen the tyranny of their
wives 
Plato and Aristotle ruled the world in their own way but could
seldom have their own way with their wives who believed that the
road to success is sealed with women pushing their husbands along 
Isn't their belief upheld by history ?
Who made Kalidas one of the greatest poets and playrights of the
world ?
Who pushed Tulsi to the world of immortality and undying fame
 ?
Modern poets are not less obliged to their mistresses and wives for
experiencing real pathos in life and then enriching their
literary output with this ennobled sweet melancholy 
 Fanny's no put into Keats' throat a number of
sweetest songs that tell of saddest thought 
I pity Dryden who couldn't realise how unjust he was when he
suggested that he would be greatly relieved when the wife was gone 
He suggested his epitaph for her grave 
 Here lies my wife here let her lie now she is at
rest and so am I 
Even today such a sick exclamation can sometime be heard somewhere
 but that's just unfair 
Generals and great politicians are no exceptions to this general
observation 
One day when a grocer complained about Mrs Lincoln's burst
of temper Mr Abraham Lincoln the great American President laid a
comforting hand on the grocer's shoulder and murmured 
Can you not stand for fifteen minutes what I have stood for fifteen years
 
Well President Lincoln knew The time heals all
wounds 
Although he had to ignore another significant fact in order to keep
his cool The time also wounds all heals 
This would explain Charles Haddons Pergent humble supplication 
god save us all from wives who are angels in the
street saints in the church and devils
 at home 
We must give them their due musn't we ?
With sincere apologies to Oscar Wilde it can be said that the
only way to get rid of a wife's callous rejection is to yield to
it 
All you need in this life in order to escape your wife's
 summary rejection of your proposals is ignorance and confidence 
You must drive out from your life all superstitions like
science and medicines 
As George Bernard Shaw would put it Because a woman
cannot put up with these unhealthy things 
A woman is like an empire in a way 
She makes quick decisions never reverses them and doesn't
think you are safe when you are out 
In these things as in most others a woman's wit is
often better than a man's arm and fate with her is often at
his wit's end 
It must not be however concluded that I am a misogynist 
Far from it 
Although some left balanced male thinkers describe a balanced
woman as one with a narrow waist and a broad mind 
I do not subcribe to this view 
 It's true that in some parts of the world even today
women do not enjoy as much lead of freedom as men do but women are not
handicapped on account of this legal flaw 
Thanks to the generosity of nature they are blessed with so
much of irresistible natural power that no discriminatory laws can harm
them 
However there seems to be some gross misunderstanding among
some misguided husbands who recently formed an association in New Delhi
 to press for their deliverance from the tyrany of their wives 
I don't understand this because wives in India hopefully 
have not yet taken to husband battering 
They do and probably justifiably so assert that an ideal wife would
be any woman who has an ideal husband 
This however raises a very feeble doubt in my mind that whoever
it was who first called women the fair sex didn't
know much about justice 
I hope my wife isn't listening to me now 
Sometimes my doubting nature drives me to think that any fool can
have and hang the wisest man in the world and so any wife can
drive even the most sensible husband to desperation by just using a
disasterous word no 
I think it will do everybody good to analyse the situations 
in which she disposes as soon as he proposes 
The wife's genius is the first factor that makes her avert
to her husband's initiative 
Do not therefore pity the unsuccessful lover of a women of genius
Save your sympathy for the man who marries her because not
before long all is real and imaginary weaknesses and failures puts spread
in the world like wild fire 
In such cases the brilliant wife may not only dispose but
go to the extent of disposing him off 
Nearly the same thing holds good about women who are uncommonly
beautiful 
Such a beautiful wife may not only come forward to edit her 
poet husband's poem but may even venture to edit him personally
An ugly duckling might not display such a fiendish talent and
other invitation to a possible catastrophe may result from marrying a woman
with relation of whom she would always boast 
There may be extremely successful people in society because of
their wealth power or excellences in some art 
The wife would tend to pity her husband and pity herself 
secretly but whenever an opportunity is is there she would
spontaneously reprimand her husband directly or indirectly for being an
inferior soul or lesser mortal 
Finally the husband's indiscreet and total submission
to his better half usually corrupts and converts her into his bitter
half 
The husband must realise that his wife is a shadow who
will turn and run ahead of him never to be caught 
If he runs after her but who will follow him tirelessly if
he even pretend to move away from her 
Anyway do not grieve friends if she still disposes as
you are on the surest way to greatness 
Behind every man with pull is a woman with a push but
quite naturally he proposes and she disposes
