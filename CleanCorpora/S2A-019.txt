""
Welcome to you 
""
This is Anu Prashantiya reporting to you from 
Doordarshan 
""
 bringing to you now the National Lawn Tennis
Championship nineteen ninety-four 
""
The finals which are just about to be played  on the Chandigarh
lawns here 
""
We have there the Governor  Lieutenant General Shibir sitting
there in the grey suit  the players coming on to the court
""
""
Seated next to him in the  is Mr Vinod Duggal
""
""
We have the  the ball boys
""
""
There we have the Governor going out to the court now  for the
inauguration 
the president of the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association 
""
We have the Governor now introducing himself 
""
Their is Asif Ismail  and Mahesh Bhupathy
""
And now we have him introducing  to the staff and the other
members 
""
He is being introduced by Mr Maria 
""
I have to introduce 
who are now  in the process of being introduced to the players of
Chandigarh 
""
I think Chandigarh has  of
having the National once again after almost fifteen years 
""
Last national  about eleven
years 
""
The last national played was here in nineteen eighty-three  in
which we had  I
won the 
""
So  after
winning the last national being played in Chandigarh  to come here and
commentate today  singles
""
""
The court 
having a talk with the Governor 
""
They are the trainees of C L T A as  been corrected by
my 
""
I have to introduce Mr Mayan Kapoor  also an
Asian  whom I have with me
doing the Hindi commentary 
""
And 
all the players  and there we have
the applause by everyone 
""
Green grass  though nationals is now
 we don't have very huge crowds watching
the nationals probably because we don't have the A T T points  and we do
not 
""
The boys here are the  who've
""
""
The huge stadium in Sector ten in Chandigarh 
""
The students seem to be very keen 
""
I think probably the school has given them the day off to come and
watch the match 
""
There the hills behind
""
I think Chandigarh by and large is a beautiful city 
""
Beautiful city with lovely weather 
""
And  taken lawn
tennis in a very big  as they made several grasscourts at the
Chandigarh 
""
And now we have 
""
Mahesh Bhupathy  Kar
""
""
He was extended 
""
And Asif Ismail beat K G Ramesh in straight sets 
""
Asif Ismail seems to be in a fitter condition because  he just
played in the Davis Cup Match and showed great promise in Jaipur 
""
But he gave away under pressure 
""
At the last minute he showed  talent but he could
not carry it on till the end 
""
Let us see 
""
The players are now warming up and uh 
""
""
Mahesh Bhupathy on your screen now  much
thinner than 
""
Players are now getting ready for the 
""
We have uh  from the commentators box we have Asif Ismail uh
""
""
First serve 
""
Uhm just missed the line 
""
Oh 
""
Serving down the middle  of uh
Bhupathy 
""
Fifteen love 
""
Again score now is 
""
First game first serve 
""
A lovely shot 
""
Asif  ki lekin
 far back and it was very easy for
Bhupathy to reach the ball 
""
There we have the action replay 
""
You can see the crosscourt 
beautiful shot there by 
""
Thirty fifteen 
""
Oh 
""
Let them  at the moment in the
beginning 
Asif is thirty O 
""
First first service 
""
Not a double four there by Asif I think he should  so early in
the game he has had first game only two double fours 
""
That was a great point for Bhupathy however 
""
Service was a little too good for him 
""
Asif is not serving that well 
""
""
""
Much much slower 
deuce 
""
That was a well played point 
""
After sent it went right upto th net  what he
should be doing after his service 
""
""
""
""
""
And 
""
I think  one has
not seen except one  the replay
""
""
""
""
Advantage again to Asif 
""
There  by a good
""
""
And  first
game 
""
Inspite of three double faults Asif has been able to foiled this
game  really fought into
this game 
""
And uh  what's
""
""
And we have the replay 
""
Service which is down the line  Asif is still watching
""
""
Now we have the 
""
 to Asif Ismail
""
""
I was just having a talk with the  administrator of Chandigarh
""
 understand that C L T A the tennis complex is
located in about three hundred 
""
And there we have uh 
foul 
""
Oh  Asif is trying for that four hand down the line
""
But I guess he was standing up too straight for that shot 
""
He needed to bend down  because the net is usually a little bit
higher on the sides 
""
One needs to get down lower on 
""
""
""
Fourth first service 
""
 a
kind of a spin 
""
We have that lovely passing shot 
""
Makes it fifteen 
""
We don't find much of excitement
""
Nobody is out there to try to break service 
""
Thirty fifteen 
""
That was a  service return a bit too higher by Asif Ismail
making it very easy for Bhupathy 
""
 very important in these points in return of service
to keep the ball low 
""
And that game point  an easy service game
there at forty fifteen 
""
Which makes it three games all 
""
We find 
""
Players are also 
""
I think this game has uh 
""
Oh 
""
What  ?
""
Fifteen love 
""
""
""
 and
""
""
The linesman is just sitting quietly 
Bhupathy arguing that that ball was right but I think  not
true really 
""
Simply 
""
Fifteen love 
""
Oh ho that was a nice 
""
I think uh  Asif Ismail a little too early there that he play
 was
Bhupathy 
""
Fifteen O 
""
Got first service 
""
Oh 
""
Besides his forehand crosscourt volley 
""
""
because the ball was so high 
""
I think the boys have to look forward to making their return of
service much better 
""
Thirty fifteen 
""
First first service 
""
""
""
Wonderful passing shot there by  Asif Ismail that was I think
the longest rally in the match today 
""
 he had to run back to get
 extended to the other end of the
court  the beautiful backhand
down drive by Asif Ismail 
""
So Asif serving forty fifteen  first first
service 
""
Oh ho  taking Asif
""
""
""
""
 just caught
on unaware this hits in the middle of the 
""
Still 
""
All first service 
""
Beautiful shot return there by  a wonderful
forehand  which makes it
deuce now 
""
A chance  wonderful shot once again you can see
how well he converted his back hand 
Asif could reach the leg 
""
""
""
Oh ho that was lucky  high backhand
volley 
backhand volley 
""
""
""
Advantage 
""
Oh  really concentrate on that one it was not
that difficult a shot 
""
That was a lovely service  a very good backhand volley
crosscourt 
""
And watch that service on the corner and  right up at
the net 
""
Oh  Asif Ismail a wonderful
backhand crosscourt 
""
""
""
There is  and
that 
""
At the 
""
""
Fifteen
""
""
Fifteen thirty 
""
""
""
Uh just missed  going
out for one of his  crosscourt return to service but he
just missed the line  to Bhupathy to
equalise the points 
""
First first service 
""
Oh lovely offensive lot there  touch of
mastery there by Asif Ismail 
""
That was a  and you could see
the stretched backhand 
the defensive lot 
""
 Asif Ismail
""
The first break point 
""
Oh  the much needed
break  which gives him a five three
lead 
""
 the second game of
second set 
""
Oops that was a 
""
Lucky shot 
""
But  the
shot  trying
to drop volley 
""
The boys are running there on the court  chooses
not to start his service 
""
These students 
""
The screen is not showing it but the  players are being
disturbed 
""
To come back on court  by and large
settled down 
""
""
and love one 
""
Oops  but I think he
did not 
""
Still in the lead Asif Ismail 
""
All first service 
""
Beautiful  at
the right time also 
""
""
return of service 
""
All first service 
ke baad 
""
Second service  there's
""
""
I think this uh taking this game  could
provide to be very risky for Asif Ismail 
""
""
""
""
""
There is the break which needed which Bhupathy was looking for
""
""
Forty love  there he lost his
concentration 
""
First first service 
""
""
""
Fifteen love second service 
""
""
Just a minute  just about
""
""
Asif Ismail is hardly showing any  the serve in the game
""
""
""
""
""
At the wrong time  if continues to do this
any further 
""
He can't afford to take it uh 
""
Beautiful service there 
""
Oh lovely passing shot there down the line  by Asif Ismail
that shows 
""
Thirty fifteen 
""
A good  in backhand pass corner of Asif
Ismail 
""
And Bhupathy is with the safe lead over 
""
The move is set  going to be difficult for Asif
Ismail now 
""
Next second service 
""
Oop 
there was a miss hit there 
""
Bhupathy still in the lead with forty thirty  on his service
""
""
A decisive volley there 
""
I think this uh set is going to be little difficult 
 defensive
backhand  Bhupathy showed a lot of consistency in
this game 
at a certain depth 
""
But now he should  Asif
Ismail serving 
""
A beautiful service  by Asif
Ismail 
""
Down the line winner there 
""
His service lacked  which is very easy to go for
the down line 
""
Thirty all  and I think the
students are moving again and disturbing Asif Ismail 
""
Good service 
himself 
""
This was an easy ball  he could have stretched himself and
tried for a winner 
""
 not even trying to move his left
leg to move 
""
Thirty all
