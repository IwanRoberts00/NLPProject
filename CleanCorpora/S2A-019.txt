The finals which are just about to be played  on the Chandigarh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the president of the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association 
""
""
""
""
""
And now we have him introducing  to the staff and the other
""
""
""
""
I have to introduce 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
winning the last national being played in Chandigarh  to come here and
""
""
""
The court 
having a talk with the Governor 
""
""
my 
""
I have to introduce Mr Mayan Kapoor  also an
Asian  whom I have with me
""
""
""
""
the applause by everyone 
""
""
 we don't have very huge crowds watching
the nationals probably because we don't have the A T T points  and we do
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
watch the match 
""
""
""
""
""
Beautiful city with lovely weather 
""
""
tennis in a very big  as they made several grasscourts at the
""
""
And now we have 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But he gave away under pressure 
""
""
not carry it on till the end 
""
Let us see 
""
The players are now warming up and uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm just missed the line 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 far back and it was very easy for
""
""
There we have the action replay 
""
You can see the crosscourt 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not a double four there by Asif I think he should  so early in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Much much slower 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think  one has
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  first
""
""
Inspite of three double faults Asif has been able to foiled this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Service which is down the line  Asif is still watching
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 understand that C L T A the tennis complex is
""
""
And there we have uh 
""
""
""
""
But I guess he was standing up too straight for that shot 
""
""
higher on the sides 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 a
kind of a spin 
""
We have that lovely passing shot 
""
""
""
""
""
Nobody is out there to try to break service 
""
Thirty fifteen 
""
""
""
""
""
to keep the ball low 
""
And that game point  an easy service game
""
""
Which makes it three games all 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 and
""
""
""
Bhupathy arguing that that ball was right but I think  not
true really 
""
Simply 
""
Fifteen love 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Fifteen O 
""

court  the beautiful backhand
