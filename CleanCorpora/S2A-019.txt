<I>
Welcome to you from Chandigarh 
This is Anu Prashantiya reporting to you from 
Doordarshan Jallandhar 
 We're bringing to you now the National Lawn Tennis
Championship nineteen ninety-four 
The finals which are just about to be played on the Chandigarh
lawns here this morning 
We have there the Governor Lieutenant General Shibir sitting
there in the grey suit awaiting the players coming on to the court
Seated next to him in the black blazer is Mr Vinod Duggal
 chief advisor to the administrator of Chandigarh 
We have the students the tennis players the ball boys
There we have the Governor going out to the court now for the
inauguration of the final accompanied by Mr Rajan Kashyap 
the president of the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association 
We have the Governor now introducing himself to the players 
Their is Asif Ismail and Mahesh Bhupathy
And now we have him introducing to the staff and the other
members 
He is being introduced by Mr Maria Secretary 
I have to introduce Mr Rajan Kashyap and the Governor 
who are now in the process of being introduced to the players of
Chandigarh 
I think Chandigarh has it's rare honour today of
having the National once again after almost fifteen years 
Last national not fifteen years it's about eleven
years 
The last national played was here in nineteen eighty-three in
which we had Vasudevan winning the mens' title and I
won the womens' title here in nineteen eighty-three 
So it's a great day for me to be here after
winning the last national being played in Chandigarh to come here and
commentate today on this mens' and the womens' singles
The court these are the ball boys the ball girls 
having a talk with the Governor 
They are the trainees of C L T A as I've been corrected by
my fellow commentator 
I have to introduce Mr Mayan Kapoor who's also an
Asian former Tennis champion junior champion whom I have with me
doing the Hindi commentary 
And that's the Governor going back after meeting 
all the players the students the ball boys and there we have
the applause by everyone 
Green grass awaits the match though nationals is now
 come of an age where we don't have very huge crowds watching
the nationals probably because we don't have the A T T points and we do
not 
The boys here are the students who are the who've
 come to watch the match 
The huge stadium in Sector ten in Chandigarh 
The students seem to be very keen on this sunny morning 
I think probably the school has given them the day off to come and
watch the match 
There the hills behind
I think Chandigarh by and large is a beautiful city 
Beautiful city with lovely weather 
And soon they have started and they've taken lawn
tennis in a very big way as they made several grasscourts at the
Chandigarh Club 
And now we have the players stepping on to the court 
Mahesh Bhupathy yesterday defeated Nitin Kar
 Kirtane 
He was extended and he had won the match in three sets 
And Asif Ismail beat K G Ramesh in straight sets 
Asif Ismail seems to be in a fitter condition because he just
played in the Davis Cup Match and showed great promise in Jaipur 
But he gave away under pressure 
At the last minute he showed a lot of talent but he could
not carry it on till the end 
Let us see how he fares in the match today 
The players are now warming up and uh that Asif Ismail 
 that's Mahesh Bhupaty now 
Mahesh Bhupathy on your screen now interruption much
thinner than interruption 
Players are now getting ready for the match 
We have uh from the commentators box we have Asif Ismail uh
 Asif Ismail serving to Mahesh Bhupathy 
First serve 
Uhm just missed the line 
Oh that was an easy shot but missed by Bhupathy 
Serving down the middle and the backhand uh of uh
Bhupathy and Bhupathy I think got the ball right in his stomach 
Fifteen love 
Again score now is thirty love 
First game first serve applaud 
A lovely shot 
Asif ne abhi drop volley try ki lekin
 drop volley was a little too far back and it was very easy for
Bhupathy to reach the ball 
There we have the action replay 
You can see the crosscourt it just touched the net cord 
beautiful shot there by Bhupathy 
Thirty fifteen 
Oh there was foul there 
Let them I think both are uh at the moment in the
beginning not very well warmed up and from thirty love up 
Asif is thirty O 
First first service 
Not a double four there by Asif I think he should so early in
the game he has had first game only two double fours 
That was a great point for Bhupathy however 
Service was a little too good for him 
Asif is not serving that well yet 
 He's capable of much better service 
Much much slower he's serving today that's 
deuce 
That was a well played point 
After sent it went right upto th net that's what he
should be doing after his service 
 Haan service 
And that's advantage point foul for service 
I think abhi tak koi accha point one has
not seen except one crosscourt forehand that's the replay
 In Hindi he's not showing 
Advantage again to Asif 
There he's taken the first game Asif by a good
 service down the line from the backhand court 
And that's one love Asif Ismail's first
game 
Inspite of three double faults Asif has been able to foiled this
game that shows that uh Bhupathy has not really fought into
this game 
And uh we are finding Asif looking back because what's
 not on the screen is that the Governor is leaving 
And we have the replay of the point 
Service which is down the line and Asif is still watching
 the Governor and everyone leaving 
Now we have the second game of the match 
 We're going to watch Bhupathy serving to Asif Ismail
I was just having a talk with the administrator of Chandigarh
 the advisor to the administrator and I was given to be 
 given to understand that C L T A the tennis complex is
located in about three hundred acre green park 
And there we have uh Bhupathy serving his first serve 
foul that's right 
Oh Asif is trying for that four hand down the line
But I guess he was standing up too straight for that shot 
He needed to bend down because the net is usually a little bit
higher on the sides 
One needs to get down lower on ones' knees 
 That's fifteen love to Bhupathy 
Fourth first service 
 That's a good variation in service from Bhupathy a
kind of a spin but however well vanished by Asif Ismail 
We have that lovely passing shot 
Makes it fifteen all two three 
We don't find much of excitement
Nobody is out there to try to break service 
Thirty fifteen fourth first service 
That was a service return a bit too higher by Asif Ismail
making it very easy for Bhupathy to put that volley away 
 It's very important in these points in return of service
to keep the ball low 
And that game point came to Bhupathy an easy service game
there at forty fifteen 
Which makes it three games all first set 
We find the usual crowd is also very quite 
Players are also lacking the enthusiasm 
I think this game has uh still to heat up 
Oh 
What ?
Fifteen love 
 There's that replay of the shot 
 There's a just a little bit out I thought and
 there's a disagreement on that point 
The linesman is just sitting quietly and that's 
Bhupathy arguing that that ball was right but I think there's not
true really 
Simply it's a long argument there 
Fifteen love 
Oh ho that was a nice return there 
I think uh Asif Ismail a little too early there that he play
 is that put away very decisively but too close was
Bhupathy and he got that return 
Fifteen O 
Got first service cough 
Oh that was a lovely put away there 
Besides his forehand crosscourt volley by Asif Ismail 
 There's that top spin service an easy volley 
because the ball was so high 
I think the boys have to look forward to making their return of
service much better 
Thirty fifteen Asif 
First first service 
 It's a very good shot return 
Wonderful passing shot there by Asif Ismail that was I think
the longest rally in the match today 
 There's that action replay he had to run back to get
 that log and there he's extended to the other end of the
court and here we see the final passing shot the beautiful backhand
down drive by Asif Ismail 
So Asif serving forty fifteen on his service first first
service 
Oh ho there quick return there by Bhupathy taking Asif
 into an unforge terrain 
 There's the replay again 
 He's rushing into the court and he's just caught
on unaware this hits in the middle of the body line shot 
Still in its point to go for the game for Asif Ismail 
All first service 
Beautiful shot return there by Bhupathy a wonderful
forehand down the line passing shot on Asif service which makes it
deuce now for the players 
A chance there that wonderful shot once again you can see
how well he converted his back hand and he went quickly before 
Asif could reach the leg 
 It's deuce 
Oh ho that was lucky that was really lucky high backhand
volley there's that service and that's the high 
backhand volley just touch the tip of the net and dropped off there 
 Let's call a lucky shot at the right time 
Advantage Asif Ismail 
Oh he didn't really concentrate on that one it was not
that difficult a shot 
That was a lovely service a very good backhand volley
crosscourt returned by Mahesh Bhupathy 
And watch that service on the corner and he's right up at
the net that's the game 
Oh beautiful shot there by Asif Ismail a wonderful
backhand crosscourt return 
 He's right up at the ball 
There is look at that stretching backhand volley and
that 
At the one word 
Fifteen
Fifteen thirty 
 Bhupathy's service 
Uh just missed that was a lovely try by Asif Ismail going
out for one of his big backhand crosscourt return to service but he
just missed the line and that gives a chance to Bhupathy to
equalise the points at thirty all 
First first service 
Oh lovely offensive lot there a beautiful shot touch of
mastery there by Asif Ismail 
That was a there's the replay and you could see
the stretched backhand volley return and that's 
the defensive lot 
 That's the break point for Asif Asif Ismail
The first break point in the match 
Oh a double fall there gives Asif Ismail the much needed
break at the right time coming also which gives him a five three
lead 
 That's Asif Ismail forty love the second game of
second set 
Oops that was a unforge terror there 
Lucky shot 
But he's got a good lead there that's the
shot we're showing you again on screen and he's trying
to drop volley but unsuccessful 
The boys are running there on the court so Asif chooses
not to start his service 
These students have to be asked to sit down 
The screen is not showing it but the players are being
disturbed because the children are moving at stadium 
To come back on court childern have now by and large
settled down 
 That's how Asif regaining forty fifteen up 
and love one for his second set 
Oops try to block that volley Asif Ismail but I think he
did not put his racket down just let flat straight out 
Still in the lead Asif Ismail serving forty thirty 
All first service 
Beautiful crosscourt backhand by Mahesh Bhupathy at
the right time also 
 There's that wonderful crosscourt backhand 
return of service which makes a deuce 
All first service I think us break 
ke baad he's lost his concentration 
Second service double faults so forty love there's
 an advantage now 
I think this uh taking this game too easy is could
provide to be very risky for Asif Ismail 
 There's a break point now for the second time 
 That's it there is the break 
There is the break which needed which Bhupathy was looking for
 Mahesh up two love 
Forty love he was leading and there there he lost his
concentration 
First first service 
 It's a very weak return of service there 
Fifteen love second service 
Just a minute just about
Asif Ismail is hardly showing any the serve in the game
 In Hindi 
At the wrong time in Hindi if continues to do this
any further he's already one game down his service is lost 
He can't afford to take it uh easy 
Beautiful service there 
Oh lovely passing shot there down the line by Asif Ismail
that shows he's a man capable of class 
Thirty fifteen 
A good service there in backhand pass corner of Asif
Ismail 
And Bhupathy is with the safe lead over in third game 
The move is set it's going to be difficult for Asif
Ismail now 
Next second service 
Oop facing the sun Bhupathy trying to give a smash 
there was a miss hit there 
Bhupathy still in the lead with forty thirty on his service
A decisive volley there gives him three love leads 
I think this uh set is going to be little difficult might 
 there's the return of service you can see this defensive
backhand crosscourt volley Bhupathy showed a lot of consistency in
this game which which a player even tries to bring up his game 
at a certain depth 
But now he should so that's love five Asif
Ismail serving 
A beautiful service down the forehand corner by Asif
Ismail 
Down the line winner there making it fifteen all 
His service lacked depth which is very easy to go for
the down line 
Thirty all no fifteen all there and I think the
students are moving again and disturbing Asif Ismail 
Good service but I don't find Bhupathy at all stretching 
himself 
This was an easy ball he could have stretched himself and
tried for a winner 
 He's standing there not even trying to move his left
leg to move movements are so slow that's an out 
Thirty all
