So today's uh recipe is the Punjabi dish we
call alu ka parontha 
It is one of uh the most favourite dishes can be used
 to be eaten at breakfast or just at tea-time 
It may be a little heavy for the ordinary people but I think
 easy to make very tasty 
Uh the ingredients that we use are mainly potatoes wheat
flour green corriander leaves salt chilli powder to your taste
 and green chilli 
Take the potatoes boil them till they are absolutely soft
Peel the potatoes mash them add the other ingredients 
that is green corriander leaves cut them absolutely fine 
add the salt according to your taste some chilli powder and
a little of ajwain 
Mix all these ingredients and prepare a ball of the mashed
potatoes 
Now this is the stuffing that we use for the 
parontha 
Regarding the wheat flour take enough quantity 
for your guest take a little water and knead the flour by gradually
adding the water to it 
See be careful you know not to make the flour very soft
the dough very soft nor very hard 
It should be medium enough I mean easy enough to roll it
out 
Make small balls of the potato stuffing and also small balls
of the dough 
Roll out the dough into a little round shape 
Yes in the shape of a small puri 
Place the potato ball in the centre flatten it on
the puri and now gradually cover it up with the dough
It and it becomes into a flat little piece 
Now roll this whole piece again out by applying a little
of the dry wheat flour and rolling it with the rolling pin 
The shape should be absolutely round the movements should be
smooth and equal so that the potato stuffing also moves equally
within the dough 
Otherwise the edges will remain without the stuffing and they
will be a little tasteless 
Once you have rolled it out properly into the shape of a 
chapati you may put it on to a heated tawa 
Keep the gas at medium heat 
When the first side of the chapati is ready
you may turn it over let it cook for sometime 
And now apply a little ghee or oil to the
surface of the chapati 
Turn it over apply a little ghee to the other
side 
And now keep moving the chapati from side to side
 till it turns a little golden brown 
This is your alu ka parontha 
 I'm sure the aroma is coming 
Well serve it to your guest along with it see that
you add a little of home butter or Amul butter and then ask
 your guest whether they enjoy it 
Of course a little of curds will add to the taste of
the whole dish 
This is alu ka parontha 
In this way you can prepare many other paronthas
 also 
They may be with the help of raddish they may be with the
help of onion and cheese cottage cheese or even with the
help of green leafy vegetables like palak 
In the same way you can as you have used potatoes you may
use the raddish that is grate the raddish squeeze the water out
 use the same ingredients and then stuff it into the dough 
As far as onion and cheese is concerned you may grate the
onion into the wheat flour as well as the cheese and then knead
the dough 
And the similar method is used for green leafy vegetables like
 palak or methi 
Cut them finely wash them and knead them with the flour and you
have a variety of paronthas either for tea or
for breakfast 
And one more 
You have a dish called one word 
Yes there are many other dishes there is no uh paucity of
dishes where the Punjabis are concerned yes
Now these are the simplest ones you can have uh what is
known as chole bhature which is a very famous 
uh Punjabi dish
 One or two words 
Right chole have to be soaked that
is they are white gram they have to be soaked overnight and uh 
so that they rise up and become soft by morning 
You may grate or in a mixer you may mash about four big 
onions 
Fry these onions to a golden brown 
Similarly add the juice of say about four tomatoes to
these onions after it has become golden brown 
Then you may add salt and uh chilli powder some of
the spices which are also of course optional 
And after you have added all these ingredients add tamarind
water a cup of tamarind water 
The chanas must be pre boiled and after
all the ingredients have been cooked well there should be no smell of
the onion remaining raw onion 
You now add the chanas to the cooked 
masala 
Add a little warm water and let the gravy remain as thick as
you would like it that is your personal taste 
Regarding the bhaturas bhaturas are made out
of maida or white flour 
Like chanas they have to be prepared the previous
 night the arrangement has to be done the previous night 
The white flour is kneaded only in curds preferably 
sour curd 
Once it has been kneaded well and thick you don't have to make
it soft you leave it overnight 
And because of the sourness of the curds the flour rises up
Next day you make small balls of this flour roll them up
with a rolling pin and you deep fry them in oil on medium heat
These are what are known as bhaturas and with
 the chanas they form the dish chole bhature
 
Before serving them see that you cut fine rings of raw onion
 long green chillies and a lots of fresh green corriander to
serve with the dish 
Uhm
Anything more yes
I do not know that punjabi dish and one or two words 
about samosas and a few words 
 Kachoris is from Gujrat
Oh kachoris are uh uh chiefly Marawari
dish
Ahn
Yes samosas are prepared universally
Uh if you want in uh Punjabi you'll have then 
dahi balle dahi balle is another dish which is typically
Punjabi 
Like the dahi wada 
Yes similarly or if uh if we can say 
 raitas are something which is totally in uh Punjabi 
That is it is prepared with curds 
Ordinarily people prefer even in the south to have curds
directly but Punjabis would prefer to have curds with something in it
Prefer that
So we have a variety of raitas 
You you may set a bowl of milk in the night to
become into curds 
In the morning you may put it into the mixer rotate it 
and then you add a little salt chilli cumin powder and a
little of powdered black salt to it as digestive 
Then it depends on what you feel like eating that day which
 raita you prefer 
It may be potato raita it may be 
cucumber raita it may be with corriander and
chilli or what we know what is popularly known as kishmish
ka raita 
I think in English we will call kishmish 
Raisin
Raisin 
Yes it is raisin 
Now the difference between preparing of the other 
raitas and raisin is that with raisin is that with raisin it is
sweet and the other raitas are with salt and
chilli 
Now when we prepare the one with raisin you take about uh
half a cup of raisin you soak them into warm water and leave them
for sometime so that they get soaked 
You put about four spoons big spoons of sugar into the curds 
rotate it well uh one fourth spoon of salt one fourth spoon of
 garam masala that is all spices crushed 
Now that it is ready you squeeze out the raisin the 
water from the raisin and you add it to the curds 
This is a special dish generally prepared on occasions 
because raisins are not very expensive now a days 
So when you have uh what you would call a dawat
 you would add the kishmish ka raita as one
of the dishes to the others now things on the menu 
The last uh dahi wada what's is
like
The dahi bhallas yes it is known as
 dahi bhalla in bhalla in
 Punjabi dahi wada universally all over India 
yes 
 Dahi wada 
It can be made out of the mung dal 
or the udad dal that is one is yellow in colour the other is
white 
Preferably it is the white one that is the udad dal
 that is used 
You soak the dal overnight you rotate it in
the mixer mixer next day 
And it has to become absolutely into a thick fine paste
But the paste must not become thin 
It should remain a little on the thick side 
Once it is ready you grind a little cumin seeds you grind
uh ginger and green chillies and add them to the ground udad
dal 
Then heat a little oil and make small balls of the udad
dal and leave them into the oil 
Keep turning them till they are a little golden brown and
remove them onto a piece of paper so that the extra oil is drained off
Now take a large quantity of curds mix it well beat it up
well add salt chilli and also a little cumin powder to it 
The bhallas which have been prepared should
be soaked for atleast fifteen minutes in warm water 
As a result all the oil is drained away into the warm water
And you don't get that taste of oil when you put it into the curds
Then soak it in the curds and allow it to stand for atleast
fifteen minutes so that the curd penetrates into the bhalla
 and softens them 
Along with these it is always better to have chutney
 
This is known as khatti mithi chutney 
You prepare it out of dates that is khajur
 and out of tamarind water 
Soak the tamarind for half an hour squeeze it out thick
liquid add a little water sugar about half a spoon little
salt chilli powder cumin powder and corriander powder to it 
Mix it up beat it up well so that all the ingredients 
form a thick paste like substance
In the same way the dates are being soaked the seeds they
have the seeds are removed and they are mashed with your hand and
you they form an absolutely thick paste and to that you may add or you
may not add a little salt and chilli powder and keep it aside so that
when you serve the bhallas arrange them beautifully
into a dish put a little curds over it add a little cha
 khatti mithi chutney on the surface and a
litlle fresh green corriander and serve it to your guests
