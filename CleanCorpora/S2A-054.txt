""
So  the Punjabi dish we
call 
""
It is one of uh  used
""
""
It may be a little heavy for the ordinary  people but I think
""
""
Uh the ingredients that we use  wheat
flour  chilli powder to your taste
""
""
Take the potatoes boil them  soft
""
""
Peel the potatoes 
that is 
add  and
a little of 
""
Mix all these ingredients  the mashed
potatoes 
""
Now this is the stuffing that we use 
parontha 
""
Regarding 
for your guest  and knead the flour by gradually
adding 
""
See  very soft
the dough very soft 
""
It should be medium  I mean easy enough to roll it
out 
""
Make small balls of the potato stuffing  and also small balls
of the dough 
""
Roll out 
""
Yes in the shape of a small 
""
Place  on
the  and now gradually cover it up with the dough
""
""
It 
""
Now roll this  by applying a little
of the dry 
""
The shape should be absolutely round  the movements should be
smooth and equal so that  equally
within the dough 
""
Otherwise the edges will remain without the stuffing  and they
will be a little tasteless 
""
Once you have rolled it out properly into the shape of a 
chapati 
""
""
Keep the gas at medium 
""
When the  is ready
you may turn it over 
""
And now apply a little  or oil to the
surface of the 
""
Turn it over  to the other
side 
""
And now keep moving the  from side to side
""
""
This is 
""
""
""
Well  see that
you add a little of  and then ask
""
""
Of course  taste of
the whole 
""
This is 
""
In this way you can prepare  paronthas
""
""
They may be  they may be with the
help of onion  even with the
help of green leafy vegetables 
""
In the same way you can  you may
use the raddish that is  squeeze the water out
""
""
""
As far as onion and cheese is concerned  you may grate the
onion into the wheat flour  knead
the dough 
""
And the similar method is used for green leafy vegetables like
""
""
Cut them finely  wash them and knead them with the flour and you
have a variety  either for tea or
for breakfast 
""
And one more 
""
""
You have a dish called 
""
""
Yes there are many other dishes there is no  uh paucity of
dishes where the Punjabis are concerned  yes
""
Now these are the simplest ones  uh what is
known as 
uh Punjabi dish
""
""
""
""
""
Right  have to be soaked that
is they are white gram 
so that they rise up and become soft by morning 
""
You may grate 
onions 
""
Fry these onions to a golden brown 
""
Similarly  to
these onions after it has become golden brown 
""
Then you may add  some of
the spices 
""
And after you have added all these ingredients  add tamarind
water a cup of tamarind water 
""
The  and after
all the ingredients have been cooked well  there should be no smell of
the onion remaining 
""
You now add the 
masala 
""
Add a little warm water  and let the gravy remain as thick as
you would like it 
""
Regarding the  are made out
of 
""
Like  they have to be prepared the previous
""
""
The white flour 
sour curd 
""
Once it has been kneaded well and thick  you don't have to make
it soft 
""
And because of the sourness of the curds  the flour rises up
""
""
Next day  roll them up
with a rolling pin  on medium heat
""
These are what are known as  and with
 chole bhature
""
""
Before serving them  see that you cut fine rings of raw onion
 to
serve with the dish 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Anything more  yes
""
""
I do not know that punjabi dish and 
about 
""
""
 is from Gujrat
""
""
Oh  uh chiefly Marawari
dish
""
""
Ahn
""
""
Yes  are prepared universally
""
""
Uh 
dahi balle  is another dish which is typically
Punjabi 
""
""
Like the 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
That is it is prepared with 
""
Ordinarily people prefer even  in the south to have curds
directly  but Punjabis would prefer to have curds with something in it
""
""
""
Prefer that
""
""
So we have a variety of 
""
You  to
become into curds 
""
In the morning 
and then you add a little  and a
little of 
""
Then it depends on  what you feel like eating that day which
""
""
It may be 
cucumber  with corriander and
chilli  kishmish
ka raita 
""
I think 
""
""
Raisin
""
""
Raisin 
""
Yes 
""
Now 
raitas  with raisin it is
sweet  with salt and
chilli 
""
Now when we prepare the one with raisin  uh
half a cup of raisin  and leave them
for sometime so that they 
""
You put about four spoons big spoons of sugar into the curds 
rotate it well  one fourth spoon of
""
""
Now that it is ready 
water from the raisin and you add it to the curds 
""
This is a special dish 
because raisins are not 
""
So  dawat
 as one
of the dishes 
""
""
The last uh  is
like
""
""
The  it is known as
 in
""
yes 
""
""
""
""
""
It can be made out of 
or the  that is one is yellow in colour the other is
white 
""
Preferably it is the white one that is the  udad dal
""
""
You soak the  you rotate it in
the mixer 
""
And it has to become absolutely into a thick fine paste
""
But the paste must not become thin 
""
It should remain a little on the thick side 
""
Once it is ready  you grind
uh ginger  udad
dal 
""
Then heat a little oil  udad
dal 
""
Keep turning them till they are a little golden brown  and
remove them  onto a piece of paper so that the extra oil is drained off
""
""
Now take  mix it well beat it up
well 
""
The  should
be soaked for atleast fifteen minutes in warm water 
""
As a result  all the oil is drained away into the warm water
""
And you don't get that taste of oil when you put it into the curds
""
""
Then soak it in the curds  and allow it to stand for atleast
fifteen minutes  bhalla
""
""
Along with these it is always better to have  chutney
""
""
This is known as 
""
You prepare it out of  khajur
""
""
Soak the tamarind for half an hour  thick
liquid  little
salt 
""
Mix it up beat it up well 
form a thick  paste like substance
""
In the same way the dates are being soaked  the seeds they
have  and
you they form an absolutely thick paste  and to that you may add or you
may not add a little salt and chilli powder and keep it aside  so that
when you serve the  arrange them beautifully
into a dish  cha
 and a
litlle fresh green corriander
