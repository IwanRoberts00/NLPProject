Okay Ganga

Okay Ganga 
uh terrorism in Kashmir 
""
You know 
somewhere around in ninety 
""
Uh we have to face such a difficult time I can't tell you
""
We left that uh place  O'clock
 so
much uhm widespread  we couldn't stay
there 
""
Like uhm  uhm uhm
to accompany them in the revolt against India
""
They want freedom  so they told us that you also accompany us
 fight against India
""
We want freedom 
""
But as it is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Muslim is more 
""
""
Yeah Muslims are more 
""
Hindus are in minority 
fight because India is our country we don't want freedom 
""
So we won't accompany you in the job 
""
""
""
They said no  accompany us
""
If if you  you have to
accompany us 
""
We said okay  some people uh accompanied them and
some people 
""
And those who didn't 
""
We just left the place in the night time  because of people were
trying to poison the water  and then they were trying to put off the
electricity in the whole 
""
And then again they were  uhm trying to trouble us by invading
our houses and trying to misbehave with our 
""
So  it the turn took like that we left the city in the middle of
the night and we got scared
""
We didn't even take things along with us  just the clothes we
were wearing 
""
We went in those clothes only uhn 
""
So later on when we came uhn  to Jammu we migrated
from Kashmir to Jammu 
""
Then uh 
in Jammu 
""
It was very difficult because Kashmir is basically a very cold
place 
""
The temperature is uh  ranges from uh thirty to say forty or so
""
""
Many 
""
""
Jammu 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Then what happened 
""
""
Yeah something about Kashmir  tell you because
Kashmiri 
""
They are not earning that much they are supposed to earn 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Uhm  in
""
I don't know it was the income was too much  it used to be somewhere
around in 
""
Now it is nothing because the tourism is nil 
""
Those people are 
""
""
""
""
""
Nobody can go to Kashmir now because they don't want any
tourists also 
""
""
""
 why the tourists
""
""
What they will do 
""
""
They might kill them  try to ask them
uh  or they might tell government to leave their
terrorist 
""
Like we leave this tourist 
terrorist 
""
Means any terrorist the government would be arresting no  the
police will be arresting 
""
Those terrorists they have to leave 
""
If uh 
""
""
But there some tourist is there or no 
""
""
There are no tourists
""
Now the tourism is at nil 
""
There are so many hill stations and uh  beautiful lakes and
forest and everything 
""
Only the export will be there  because the fruits there are lot
of apples and peaches and plums and pears 
""
Those all  means sent out of the
Kashmir 
""
They won't keep it there because  that is the only they have
income for them 
""
Those people are also suffering a lot
""
So many people have died 
""
They were supposed to be a big big very big field  there uhn
""
""
You think 
""
""
I don't think it will improve because  those people already
many have died no 
""
So they want that let some more also die but  take
the freedom 
""
But I think India also won't let it go because  uhm if India
""
""
It has to let go  problem also
there
""
They also then  uhm this another
state for them people 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
I mean  this problem will never
end and 
""
We have left all our property there  lakhs
""
""
And all it is very difficult and  especially for business people
 uh
rely upon business there 
""
Anytime it  or any time in cross
fire your life is also not secured there 
""
You may 
you never know that you will come back in the evening  because the
condition is like that 
""
In the evening time you are not allowed to keep the electricity on
""
""
They think that  security people think that you
are doing any conspiracy inside 
""
So for that also you have to  you don't have
any freedom literally there because even now security forces are trying to
""
""
But that  and that strictness
seems to be adopted to the people there 
""
Even they are getting against 
""
""
Life is nothing 
""
""
Life is nothing  that is not the question
""
Life is something but you have to struggle to achieve something 
""
""
Life is a dream 
""
""
""
""
""
Nothing 
""
""
I think 
""
""
Missing my mummy 
""
""
Missing my papa  missing my everyone
""
""
What to do 
""
""
