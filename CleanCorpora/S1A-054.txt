<I>
Okay Ganga 
Okay Ganga today I tell you uhn about the 
uh terrorism in Kashmir 
You know uhm when we left Kashmir no uhm 
somewhere around in ninety ninety yeah ninety March 
Uh we have to face such a difficult time I can't tell you
We left that uh place in the night time two O'clock
 because the terrorism was so much means like it was so so
much uhm widespread you couldn't yeah we couldn't stay
there 
Like uhm those terrorists uh they wanted us to uhm uhm
to accompany them in the revolt against India
They want freedom so they told us that you also accompany us
 and we'll fight against India
We want freedom we'll have a separate state 
But as it is Hindus are in minority there in Kashmir uhm 
 Uhn 
 Uhm 
 You couldn't 
Muslim is more 
Yeah Muslims are more in number 
Hindus are in minority so Hindus said no we will not uh 
fight because India is our country we don't want freedom 
So we won't accompany you in the job 
 That's why those uhm Muslims they got very angry 
They said no you have to accompany us accompany us
If if you if you want to live in this place you have to
accompany us 
We said okay fine uh some people uh accompanied them and
some people didn't 
And those who didn't we were one among them 
We just left the place in the night time because of people were
trying to poison the water and then they were trying to put off the
electricity in the whole one word in the whole city 
And then again they were uhm trying to trouble us by invading
our houses and trying to misbehave with our women and all 
So it the turn took like that we left the city in the middle of
the night and we got scared
We didn't even take things along with us just the clothes we
were wearing 
We went in those clothes only uhn 
So later on when we came uhn to uh to Jammu we migrated
from Kashmir to Jammu 
Then uh then there we couldn't adjust with climate and all 
in Jammu 
It was very difficult because Kashmir is basically a very cold
place and uh Jammu is a very hot place 
The temperature is uh ranges from uh thirty to say forty or so
 forty-five 
Many Kashmiris died also in Jammu because of hot weather 
Jammu 
Yeah uhm then uhm 
Then what happened 
Yeah something about Kashmir I'll tell you because
Kashmiri in Kashmir Muslims are also suffering a lot 
They are not earning that much they are supposed to earn 
Uhn 
Uhm I tell you like uhm uh in our Kashmir no in
 summer months we used to have some uh somewhere around uhm 
I don't know it was the income was too much it used to be somewhere
around in crores when it comes on state level 
Now it is nothing because the tourism is nil 
Those people are suffering 
 Nobody can go 
Nobody can go to Kashmir now because they don't want any
tourists also 
 They're kidnapping tourists 
 That's why the tourists
What they will do this this kidnappers to tourist 
They might kill them or they might uh try to ask them
uh like to do something or they might tell government to leave their
terrorist in uh return 
Like we leave this tourist only if you return that uh 
terrorist which you've uh arrested 
Means any terrorist the government would be arresting no the
police will be arresting 
Those terrorists they have to leave 
If uh 
But there some tourist is there or no in Kashmir 
There are no tourists
Now the tourism is at nil 
There are so many hill stations and uh beautiful lakes and
forest and everything but all in vain now 
Only the export will be there because the fruits there are lot
of apples and peaches and plums and pears 
Those all they'll export now means sent out of the
Kashmir 
They won't keep it there because that is the only they have
income for them 
Those people are also suffering a lot
So many people have died 
They were supposed to be a big big very big field there uhn
You think it'll improve now 
I don't think it will improve because those people already
many have died no 
So they want that let some more also die but we'll take
the freedom once for all 
But I think India also won't let it go because uhm if India
 let's it go means it has to let go also Punjab also then 
It has to let go uhm then this naxalite uh problem also
there
They also then then also they have to give uhm this another
state for them people for those people also 
Uhm
I mean so so I think uh this problem will never
end and uh sufferers are we people 
We have left all our property there worth lakhs
 of rupees 
And all it is very difficult and especially for business people
 they have just scrambled businesses all flop there nobody can uh
rely upon business there 
Anytime it the shop may be burnt down or any time in cross
fire your life is also not secured there 
You may you go out of the house in the morning you do 
you never know that you will come back in the evening because the
condition is like that 
In the evening time you are not allowed to keep the electricity on
They think that uhm those uh security people think that you
are doing any conspiracy inside 
So for that also you have to take care you you don't have
any freedom literally there because even now security forces are trying to
 get the situation in normal 
But that requires a lot of strictness and that strictness
seems to be adopted to the people there 
Even they are getting against security people now 
Life is nothing 
Life is nothing that is not the question
Life is something but you have to struggle to achieve something 
Life is a dream 
 That's all 
Nothing 
I think 
Missing my mummy 
Missing my papa missing my everyone
What to do 
It really yaar feeling so bored I mean in
the hostel 
 One word you will feel bored yaar
