A very good afternoon to all our viewers from us here at the
""
""
The last and final session of the 
""
""
""
""
frames to four 
""
 he has to win just
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
virtually unstoppable 
""
""
And the centre piece of this morning session  was a marvellous
""
""
""
""
O'Salavan 
""
""
 the air
""
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He can set himself up for a useful opening break 
""
 a contrast in styles between these two players
""
the two  the more thoughtful of the two
""
""
""
Snooker is not a game which you can really  uh play with any
degree of carelessness 
""
You can play of course but you have to be careful  and I think
""
opponent 
""
""
""
And uh  take a heavy toll of his
""
""
""
""
going to Salavan 
""
A plant is  pick the first rid hit
it on to the second rid 
""
""
""
""
""
He brought out the pink  he has now sink it in the
""
""
And position for any of the open rids 
""
""
""
""
""
if that red 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  good break
""
""
""
Nothing to play except safer 
""
""
lovely hand between if the ball has enough run in it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that rid 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 playing
""
""
""
brown 
""
""
""
""
ahead and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
lot of left hand spin to take the ball  off the cushion closer to the blue
""
""
""
""
""
Anyway  clean pot on the
""
""
He just landed it  the bottom
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
should have easily 
""
""
player definitely  level scores or go further because all the
""
""
""
""
being a left hander 
""
""
""
""
""
Going for the pink ball  follows without
""
""
Now left on with the red 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And this is uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now beautiful shot there and he is  right in possession for
""
""
Break of thirty-five which puts him five 
""
""
Uh ah  he played well for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
damn good shot on that actually  this was a careless
shot because he couldn't reach 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
cushion 
""
""
""
""
""
he can stun it off the bob cushion 
""
And  Yelston must be kicking himself
""
taken a few seconds more over that safety shot 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
over as quickly as possible 
""
""
he needs the blue and the pink 
""
Oh  before two frames of
the match and the first frame of the last session has gone  O'Salavans'
""
""
""
under twenty-one world snooker championship 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  only to
""
""
If he had  to have any sort of chance of getting back into this
""
had an outstanding opportunity of doing so  as we said before
""
""
Well he is off some of the  first our
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
First sessions score 
""
subsequently 
""
The scores actually 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
First two frames were taken by Yelston 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
""
""
fifteen year old Ronie  nineteen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Salavans  obviously out of
""
""
""
He has  and and it is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For his adolescent as I should call him being sixteen years old
""
""
""
Looking for the plant  trying to slam it now
""
uh 
""
But the way he  burst the
""
""
""
 and if Ronie goes for
this 
""
""
 got it well
""
""
If he gets that now that 
""
sort of a challenge that 
""
""
With all those reds spread out on the table it looks like a
Christmas tree  his now in a in a
""
he's 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Round of applause for getting himself out of that self
""
""
""
""
""
frame 
""
""
Now well  he got the edge on
""
""
""
""
""
""
a good number of points  muster up all
""
""
""
""
something silly 
""
""
""
""
""
This is the longest that he has 
""
""
""
""
""
First time 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
slower situation that he has to 
""
""
So the score is 
""
""
""
""
""
All the reds are spread out fairly easily  fairly comfortably
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 obstruct the few
balls around 
""
""
""
