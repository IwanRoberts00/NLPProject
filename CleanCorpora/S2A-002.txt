A very good afternoon to all our viewers from us here at the
Karnatak State Billiards Association match for 
""
The last and final session of the 
snooker championship 
""
And the man you see on your screens is Ronie  of
England  nine
frames to four 
""
 he has to win just
two more frames 
snoo 
""
His opponent who you see on your screen now is Patrick  Yelston
of Belgium 
uh  and is
""
""
Ronie Salavan  on the first session of this match which was held
yesterday 
""
But this morning in the  he was
virtually unstoppable 
""
""
And the centre piece of this morning session  was a marvellous
break of a hundred and thirty-one total clearance  except for the black
""
""
Uh 
O'Salavan 
""
And  a bit
 the air
conditioning is on in the hall
""
""
reason for 
""
Now 
""
His opponent does  well his opponent hasn't done much in fact
 the
left corner pocket on your screen 
""
The black is clear  with a
ton of 
""
He can set himself up for a useful opening break 
""
 a contrast in styles between these two players
with  uhm certainly I would say the more gifted of
the two  the more thoughtful of the two
""
And I think that that is the right approach 
""
Snooker is not a game which you can really  uh play with any
degree of carelessness 
""
You can play of course but you have to be careful  and I think
this is the difference between  Belgium
opponent 
""
Certain loose reds open 
""
And uh  take a heavy toll of his
""
""
""
Wondering if there is plant on after us  black which is
going to Salavan 
""
A plant is  pick the first rid hit
it on to the second rid 
""
""
""
That was a beautiful shot 
""
He brought out the pink  he has now sink it in the
centre pocket and come 
""
And position for any of the open rids 
right hand side of the screen that is  come for now
is next to the pink spot 
""
""
From where we are seating in the commentators box it seems as
if that red 
 from this angle
""
""
And  turn it
into the cluster of edge to open them up 
""
""
""
But  I think may be useful forty-five break
""
Perhaps he will now opt for a safe shot 
""
Sending the ball towards the bob cushion 
""
So  good break
of forty-five 
""
""
Nothing to play except safer 
""
 extraordinary and
lovely hand between if the ball has enough run in it 
""
""
Uhm  Yelston who
want to avoid 
""
Cannot afford to play careless shots and open up  the edge to an
opponents 
""
Will you agree with that Arvind ?
""
""
Definitely but at the moment the way he  played
that rid 
took a wild swing
""
He has gone back to the bottom of the table 
""
So he may not have just a intellect to pot it 
""
He might have intended to pot it as well as  end up towards the
bottom because the ball had sufficient run in it 
""
Anyway  Salavan leaves
him a red which is reasonably easy for his potting skill 
""
And now  this will show whether the young man is going for his
 playing
""
""
He can pot to brown in the corner pocket or snooker in behind the
brown 
""
""
""
He knows  forty points
ahead and 
well 
""
""
""
""
""
That was a very good shot 
""
But 
""
""
His intention in that particular shot was to play it with a
lot of left hand spin to take the ball  off the cushion closer to the blue
so that the blue could be potted in the centre pocket 
""
But  he hit it so hard that the spin didn't really have time to
react 
""
Anyway  clean pot on the
blue ball 
""
He just landed it  the bottom
pocket 
""
He is attempting a similar shot now in the corner pocket now 
""
May be worry of uh  sleeve touching
the yellow 
""
And 
""
Salvan has really left this shot with that careless shot for he
should have easily 
""
Uh 
player definitely  level scores or go further because all the
reds are 
""
And he has  except that
he has to play it with the rest because he might  not be able to reach it
being a left hander 
""
There again he went to playing with the  rest with his right
hand instead of now the normal left hand that he uses to 
a 
""
Going for the pink ball  follows without
those two reds 
""
Now left on with the red 
""
Very well done 
""
Perfectly in position for the pink 
""
A soft stunt loosen the 
""
Perfectly in position for the black 
""
And this is uh 
on your black and white screens 
""
A frame which should have uh 
gone to Ronie Salavan 
player 
""
 no place for the black ball to be spotted on his
own spot
""
The red is occupying the black spots uh  area
 the black still spotted on the yellow spot
""
""
Now beautiful shot there and he is  right in possession for
that ball 
""
Break of thirty-five which puts him five 
""
""
Uh ah  he played well for
remaining position for the blue 
""
He might even attempt the black because he got the angle to come up
comfortably 
""
That was a  very hard shot that he played on the black but the
ball didn't really 
""
""
damn good shot on that actually  this was a careless
shot because he couldn't reach 
""
""
 I think that that he
should have played this shot over reaching with the rest  and giving
Salavan a chance 
""
Of course as you can see the yellow is tied against the 
cushion 
""
And uh  to pot it in
position 
""
Well I think Salavan has done quite well to get where he is  and
he can stun it off the bob cushion 
""
And  Yelston must be kicking himself
right there because  he could have wrapped up this frame if he had just
taken a few seconds more over that safety shot 
""
Now this is a crunch ball 
""
""
It has come a little too much  for Salavan has to use the
wrist 
""
""
One point behind 
""
""
Yes indeed 
""
""
Ronie Salavan has tasted blood and he wants to get this match
over as quickly as possible 
""
So 
he needs the blue and the pink 
""
Oh  before two frames of
the match and the first frame of the last session has gone  O'Salavans'
 way
""
 the
under twenty-one world snooker championship 
""
And uh there you see Yelston  left hand over his
eyes
""
 rather dreadful
safety shot 
""
Uh  only to
be expected
""
If he had  to have any sort of chance of getting back into this
match  it was important for him to win this first frame and he certainly
had an outstanding opportunity of doing so  as we said before
""
""
Well he is off some of the  first our
view of the whole 
""
The Karnataka State Billiards Association is very fortunate in
having its own premises 
where the scores of the famous  in the
final 
""
""
First sessions score 
thirty-nine sixty-two 
subsequently 
""
The scores actually 
""
Uh some of them have gone 
""
""
Yes  the scores are quite right because it
was 
""
""
No the scores
""
""
Yeah you are right you are right 
""
First two frames were taken by Yelston 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not 
yesterday's  who got that got
the 
""
""
Yelston has just broken up for  fifteenth frame
of the match  young Ronie
fifteen year old Ronie  nineteen
ninety-one 
""
""
Feels extremely the pity but uh  there is an applause
that brilliant shot on the last but one red 
""
Fouled uh  what could
have been very interesting match is now going to be 
Salavans  obviously out of
Yelston 
""
""
He has  and and it is
great but as such
""
""
No doubt about it 
""
""
Now  I mean he is
quite remarkable this man 
""
For his adolescent as I should call him being sixteen years old
""
""
""
Looking for the plant  trying to slam it now
this was the shot which uh  could have
uh 
""
But the way he  burst the
back  on this
""
""
 and if Ronie goes for
this 
one level black spot the second one 
""
 got it well
""
""
If he gets that now that 
bringing him back up the table  any
sort of a challenge that 
""
""
With all those reds spread out on the table it looks like a
Christmas tree  his now in a in a
difficult position because 
he's 
this must be uh well
""
""
""
""
""
So not much damage done  point
of view  wide slash that he took at the red
""
""
""
Round of applause for getting himself out of that self
imposed snooker 
""
Ronie 
""
And as I said before  this
frame 
""
""
Now well  he got the edge on
that rid 
""
However the long pot was won and 
Patrick Yelston 
""
This is again an opening from which the Belgian can 
a good number of points  muster up all
the guts that are required to face a situation like this 
""
""
Provided he doesn't get a rush of blood to the head and do
something silly 
""
""
You know 
you've 
""
This is the longest that he has 
taken 
""
""
Yes 
""
First time 
""
Uh 
""
""
Actually what happens when a person is a very fast player
""
""
His reflexes are fast his uh  brain muscle coordination is
fantastic and  cope to the
slower situation that he has to 
""
""
So the score is 
O'Salavan 
""
And it certainly could be  a
winning situation 
""
All the reds are spread out fairly easily  fairly comfortably
and 
""
Just needs to keep his cool and  the rest will fall on place
""
""
""
Brushing some of the dust away from the  area of the pink
 obstruct the few
balls around

The following up for the black off a cushion  black ball on
the spot
