<I>
A very good afternoon to all our viewers from us here at the
Karnatak State Billiards Association match for 
The last and final session of the world under twenty-one 
snooker championship is about to commence 
And the man you see on your screens is Ronie O'Salavan of
England fifteen year old who has established a dominating nine
frames to four uhm lead in this finals 
 It's the best of twenty-one so he has to win just
two more frames to win the world under twenty-one 
snoo snooker crown 
His opponent who you see on your screen now is Patrick Yelston
of Belgium sixteen years old who is has 
uh amazed everyone with his tremendous sporting ability and is
 is in happy temperament 
Ronie Salavan on the first session of this match which was held
yesterday just managed to get into a four frame to three lead 
But this morning in the second session of the match he was
virtually unstoppable winning four out of the five frames that 
 was was were played 
And the centre piece of this morning session was a marvellous
break of a hundred and thirty-one total clearance except for the black
Uh that what you saw that was a mis clue for Ronie 
O'Salavan 
And uh he is uhm it's it's a bit
 it's a bit humid out there although the air
conditioning is on in the hall
 It's a bit humid and possibly uh that was the 
reason for that mis cue 
Now let's see here 
His opponent does well his opponent hasn't done much in fact
 he's left the red hanging over the corner pockets the
left corner pocket on your screen 
The black is clear so if Salavan can put this with a
ton of stunt which he has done 
He can set himself up for a useful opening break 
 There's a contrast in styles between these two players
with O'Salavan uhm certainly I would say the more gifted of
the two also being the more thoughtful of the two
And I think that that is the right approach 
Snooker is not a game which you can really uh play with any
degree of carelessness 
You can play of course but you have to be careful and I think
this is the difference between Ronie Salavan and his Belgium
opponent 
Certain loose reds open 
And uh O'Salavan can take a heavy toll of his
 opponent's careless safety shot cough 
Wondering if there is plant on after us black which is
going to Salavan 
A plant is a shot where you pick the first rid hit
it on to the second rid and make second rid travel into the pocket 
 It's a charge 
That was a beautiful shot applause 
He brought out the pink and he has now sink it in the
centre pocket and come back towards this end of the table 
And position for any of the open rids on the right hand 
right hand side of the screen that is the one he's come for now
is next to the pink spot 
From where we are seating in the commentators box it seems as
if that red his might not be free or yes it is 
 it is free only it doesn't look like from this angle
And here's his chance to put the blue and turn it
into the cluster of edge to open them up 
 That's not exactly what he had intended 
But I think may be useful forty-five break
Perhaps he will now opt for a safe shot 
Sending the ball towards the bob cushion applause 
So that's got to Ronie Salavan with a good break
of forty-five 
Nothing to play except safer 
 It's the one word shot extraordinary and
lovely hand between if the ball has enough run in it 
Uhm that's the kind of thing that Yelston who
want to avoid if he has any hope of getting back into this match 
Cannot afford to play careless shots and open up the edge to an
opponents who's playing in a good form 
Will you agree with that Arvind ?
Definitely but at the moment the way he has played
that rid it might have been a shot to nothing shot whether he 
took a wild swing
He has gone back to the bottom of the table 
So he may not have just a intellect to pot it 
He might have intended to pot it as well as end up towards the
bottom because the ball had sufficient run in it 
Anyway a shot that is being played now by Salavan leaves
him a red which is reasonably easy for his potting skill 
And now this will show whether the young man is going for his
 game or whether he's going to be play playing
 KG 
He can pot to brown in the corner pocket or snooker in behind the
brown 
 He's slumped didn't had a good follower 
He knows that though his opponent has got forty points
ahead and may be he can possibly make up his by sneaking 
well few points 
 Well 
That was a very good shot 
But 
His intention in that particular shot was to play it with a
lot of left hand spin to take the ball off the cushion closer to the blue
so that the blue could be potted in the centre pocket 
But he hit it so hard that the spin didn't really have time to
react 
Anyway he did a marvellous job in that uh clean pot on the
blue ball 
He just landed it in into the bottom
pocket 
He is attempting a similar shot now in the corner pocket now 
May be worry of uh his waist coat or his sleeve touching
the yellow he played that in very much of hurry and missed it 
And that's the first decent uh opening 
Salvan has really left this shot with that careless shot for he
should have easily potted that rid 
Uh now the Bel Belgium 
player definitely should level scores or go further because all the
reds are in a position that he can manoveur them open 
And he has opened out one red comfortably except that
he has to play it with the rest because he might not be able to reach it
being a left hander 
There again he went to playing with the rest with his right
hand instead of now the normal left hand that he uses to play his uh 
a inactive pots 
Going for the pink ball clean as a whistle follows without
those two reds 
Now left on with the red in the centre 
Very well done 
Perfectly in position for the pink 
A soft stunt loosen the a red into the corner 
Perfectly in position for the black 
And this is uh said for certain viewers viewing this game 
on your black and white screens 
A frame which should have uh for all practical purposes 
gone to Ronie Salavan is now coming back towards the Belgium 
player 
 There's no place for the black ball to be spotted on his
own spot
The red is occupying the black spots uh blacks' area
 and as such is been the black still spotted on the yellow spot
Now beautiful shot there and he is right in possession for
that ball applause 
Break of thirty-five which puts him five points ahead of uh 
 Ronie's score 
Uh ah applause beautiful shot he played well for
remaining position for the blue 
He might even attempt the black because he got the angle to come up
comfortably 
That was a very hard shot that he played on the black but the
ball didn't really travel as much as he wanted to 
 He's done a damn good practice of play that 
damn good shot on that actually he could have uh this was a careless
shot because he couldn't reach and he played a haphazard shot 
 It's a pity that after that I think that that he
should have played this shot over reaching with the rest and giving
Salavan a chance to uh get back straight away 
Of course as you can see the yellow is tied against the 
cushion the bob cushion 
And uh it will require some effort to to pot it in
position uh correctly for the green 
Well I think Salavan has done quite well to get where he is and
he can stun it off the bob cushion 
And I'm sure that Yelston must be kicking himself
right there because he could have wrapped up this frame if he had just
taken a few seconds more over that safety shot 
Now this is a crunch ball the green he can get this 
It has come a little too much for Salavan has to use the
wrist 
One point behind 
Yes indeed applause 
Ronie Salavan has tasted blood and he wants to get this match
over as quickly as possible 
So he's now gone into the lead by three points 
he needs the blue and the pink to wrap up the frame 
Oh that's it applause before two frames of
the match and the first frame of the last session has gone O'Salavans'
 way
 He's now just one frame away from winning the
under twenty-one world snooker championship 
And uh there you see Yelston with his left hand over his
eyes
 I'm sure he's rueing that rather dreadful
safety shot 
Uh looking a bit dejected but that's only to
be expected
If he had to have any sort of chance of getting back into this
match it was important for him to win this first frame and he certainly
had an outstanding opportunity of doing so that as we said before
 that hasty shot cost him the frame 
Well he is off some of the yes and now beautiful first our
view of the whole arena very handsome arena 
The Karnataka State Billiards Association is very fortunate in
having its own premises and having such a wonderful match room 
where the scores of the famous that's been played in the
final 
First sessions score as you can see on the board 
thirty-nine sixty-two loosing the first frame and uh 
subsequently twenty-four seventy three 
The scores actually are the other way round 
Uh some of them have gone 
Yes there's the scores are quite right because it
was 
No the scores
Yeah you are right you are right 
First two frames were taken by Yelston 
 Yesterday's score 
 Yesterday's score 
Not todays' first sessions' but 
yesterday's and then it was uh Salavan who got that got
the 
Yelston has just broken up for the fifteenth frame
of the match and should he loose this of course young Ronie
fifteen year old Ronie O'Salavan will be the nineteen
ninety-one world under twenty-one snooker champion 
Feels extremely the pity but uh there is an applause
that brilliant shot on the last but one red 
Fouled uh spoiled his safety shot and what could
have been very interesting match is now going to be possibly 
Salavans uh very easy manner now that the fight is obviously out of
Yelston applause 
He has tied our equation and and it is
great but as such
No doubt about it 
Now let's see what what he does I mean he is
quite remarkable this man 
For his adolescent as I should call him being sixteen years old
 sixteen years of age 
Looking for the plant and trying to slam it now
this was the shot which uh if played a little carefully could have
uh brought him back very much into the game 
But the way he is has burst the
back he's still not run left Ronie a little easy on this
 He's lost the black alright and if Ronie goes for
this last set of the screen on your left hand side as you see or the 
one level black spot the second one 
 That's the one I mean and he's got it well
If he gets that now that he's got this a colour 
bringing him back up the table will probably put that to any
sort of a challenge that the Belgian might have had in mind 
With all those reds spread out on the table it looks like a
Christmas tree and uh here O'Salavan his now in a in a
difficult position because he's right on the cushion and 
he's attempting a slice which he has got in fact and uh 
this must be uh well
 Two words 
So not much damage done uh from Yelston's point
of view uh as a result of that wide slash that he took at the red
 applause 
Round of applause for getting himself out of that self
imposed snooker 
Ronie O'Salavan five Patrick Yelston six 
And as I said before O'Salavan needing just this
frame to win the title 
Now well planned safety shot but he got the edge on
that rid still didn't uh remain in the centre area 
However the long pot was won and it was played well by 
Patrick Yelston 
This is again an opening from which the Belgian can make 
a good number of points that depends whether he can muster up all
the guts that are required to face a situation like this 
Provided he doesn't get a rush of blood to the head and do
something silly 
You know it's uh is quite possible because 
you've seen him break down on the easiest of shots 
This is the longest that he has take 
taken to plan a break if you noticed Mike 
Yes same stroke that strike me I must confess 
First time we've seen him thinking so much 
Uh this is just just he stress at that 
Actually what happens when a person is a very fast player
 tries to think and play a slow game 
His reflexes are fast his uh brain muscle coordination is
fantastic and uh he doesn't have the ability to cope to the
slower situation that he has to at times plan and do 
So the score is Patrick Yelston twenty-two Ronie 
O'Salavan five with with this break in hand 
And it certainly could be by the looks of it uhm a
winning situation 
All the reds are spread out fairly easily fairly comfortably
and 
Just needs to keep his cool and the rest will fall on place
Brushing some of the dust away from the area of the pink
 must have felt that there is something which might obstruct the few
balls around 
The following up for the black off a cushion black ball on
the spot comfortably to go round off a cushion
