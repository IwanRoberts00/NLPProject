<I>
""
""
Well alternatively we also have the  long jump
""
eight hundred metres 
""
""
Just look out for that man in the full black  William Tanui
""
""
If Natalia  uh went full ahead after the first lap
in full red 
""
This time it is William Tanui  in full black
""
But mind you  there are five Kenyans in this race
""
You really can't say 
""
They just run and run 
""
There goes the start 
""
The first hundred  when
you cut into 
""
William Tanui 
""
Two Kenyans in the track 
""
But looks like Vincent Malakawen 
""
But running very easily  is William Tanui the man in full black
""
""
You see that old bunch of there  and here is Avtaar Singh coming
in there on your screen 
""
First is the Kenyan 
""
Now look in second position William Tanui  interruption
""
""
Here is they all running crowded 
""
Now that is William Tanui now 
""
Two hundred metres 
""
Another Kenyan in the front 
it's 
William Tanui 
""
Oh the great fight between three Kenyan 
""
William Tanui has fallen behind  and another one has come
through 
""
Robert Kibbet of Kenya 
""
So as uh  they say in Kenya one runner after another comes
through 
""
Now look at this Robert Kibbet coming from behind 
""
He was in third position 
and went on 
""
William Tanui 
""
He did manage to come through  but Kibbet
had made  Robert
Kibbet the winner 
""
""
But you couldn't have asked for any finer isn't it John ?
""
""
Oh yeah  uh they keep saying in the
interview last evening  William
Tanui 
today and who can win tomorrow 
""
""
Well  the stuff that the Kenyans are made up of
 acknowledging the greetings
from uh this very hospitable crowd here in Pune 
""
I think they will be acknowledging everything that has been good
 John this has been the best race of the day so far
""
""
""
Yes this was a very good race because uh  he came right
from the outside and came in 
""
""
Well what is it that uh makes the Kenyans uh  keep on
clicking in these races  ?
""
""
Now 
""
""
Well  from
the score board end 
""
""
 as we welcome you viewers uh
""
Vladimir Dubrovschik  he has the personal best of sixty-eight point eight
zero metres  he
obviously has 
""
""
Well John I think 
what happened  the hot
favourite Jurgen Schultz of Germany  and over the last ten to fifteen
minutes he has been full of joy and ecstasy 
""
 of his T-shirts and given
them away to the crowd 
""
And the joy is written clearly all over his face and body 
""
For a man of his stature  he is doing the
laugh of honour 
""
And what a happy moment this is for him 
""
Well the Germans have been a  great favourite in the discus but
uh 
""
Jurgen Schultz  one
word 
""
And that that will be victory ceremony for the  long
jump
""
The winner  clearing
seven point eight two metres 
""
So the Chines uh 
""
In second spot Vladimir 
seven point seven seven metres 
""
And uh taking the bronze uh 
Obed Bashir 
""
So the uh Chinese uh  continuing with the success story here at
the  winning one more gold medal
""
""
And uh  fifteen
hundred metres  ended in victory for the Irish girl Sonia
 the hot favourite for this event as John describe
earlier on 
""
""
Yeah Sonia 
but I would like to  since she has is in the way to winning
streak at the moment 
""
And you can see what a lovely play she  over through to Roja
Kutty  she was
the only challenger for her  as
well 
""
That was the 
""
""
Seven of them in contention 
""
Three from India  Verghese and
uh 
""
The uh  national record is in the name of Satbir Singh
seventy-five point two two
""
 uh

""

screen now 
""

and uh while we 
the  it was expected from
her 
""
There has been an upset in  discus which we announced
earlier on  the official result having
come in 
""
And uh  with uh Nick Winnie of
Irelend finishing second  and uh the German
the world record holder Jurgen Schultz  uh in third spot sixty-one point
three eight 
""
So on a day when Merelene Ottey John  the
expected title Jurgen Schultz has lost out
""
""
Jurgen Schultz uh  but he was not in the best
streak of the moment  the seventy-four which
he felt 
but uh he himself  did not dream that he could throw seventy-four point
zero eight 
""
And even convinced I beleive  for the judges were lying when
they said that that was the world record 
""
But Jurgen Schultz as I said earlier  between
 in his sports
promotion business  because
uh 
Whooker 
""
""
Well John uh the action is now centred at uh 
""
""
The hundred metre
""
""

long long time  Adil Somadiwala isn't it ?

Now  Chinese man is going to
do  even with the very
few that have come out to  that uh they have some good
stuff in their country  they are going to
do or not uh  I mean uh they have not got of course the best
from out there

But even those that have come here 
""

 because he came out at the time when the
American 
""

Rajiv Balakrishnan from India

Rajiv Balakrishnan is not on the list of runners  but uh
""

And  he could come in because he
is training more for the two hundred metres  the Indian

fight between  China

""
And here is the replay 
""
On the first lane is uh  and
