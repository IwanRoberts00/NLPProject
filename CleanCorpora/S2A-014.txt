<I>
Well alternatively we also have the women's long jump
 at the other end but we shift our attention to the men's 
eight hundred metres all is set now and uh 
Just look out for that man in the full black William Tanui
If Natalia Dukhnova uh went full ahead after the first lap
in full red 
This time it is William Tanui in full black
But mind you there are five Kenyans in this race
You really can't say about these Kenyans 
They just run and run 
There goes the start interruption 
The first hundred on the track and then shifting it by when
you cut into the first lane 
William Tanui in third position at the moment 
Two Kenyans in the track 
But looks like Vincent Malakawen and Henry Lebo 
But running very easily is William Tanui the man in full black
 applause interruption 
You see that old bunch of there and here is Avtaar Singh coming
in there on your screen interruption 
First is the Kenyan interruption 
Now look in second position William Tanui interruption
Here is they all running crowded interruption 
Now that is William Tanui now 
Two hundred metres free row 
Another Kenyan in the front let's see now whether 
it's going to be like Kiptanui who was beaten but this time 
William Tanui still there applaud interruption 
Oh the great fight between three Kenyan 
William Tanui has fallen behind and another one has come
through at number one one two interruption 
Robert Kibbet of Kenya was a surprise winner here 
So as uh they say in Kenya one runner after another comes
through so here is another champion coming 
Now look at this Robert Kibbet coming from behind 
He was in third position and he stretch right through 
and went on to first position 
William Tanui came in too late 
He did manage to come through to second position but Kibbet
had made the break through at the right moment and thus Robert
Kibbet the winner of the eight hundred metres 
But you couldn't have asked for any finer isn't it John ?
Oh yeah it's because uh they keep saying in the
interview last evening both this uh uh Kip Tanui and William
Tanui that you can never say in Kenya who can win and who can't 
today and who can win tomorrow 
Well that's the stuff that the Kenyans are made up of
 and there they are the three of them acknowledging the greetings
from uh this very hospitable crowd here in Pune 
I think they will be acknowledging everything that has been good
 and I think uh John this has been the best race of the day so far
Yes this was a very good race because uh he came right
from the outside and came in 
Well what is it that uh makes the Kenyans uh keep on
clicking in these races ?
Now recording broken 
Well it's going to be Steve Watt continue from
the score board end 
 Men's javeline uh as we welcome you viewers uh
 back to the Shiv Chhattrapati Sports Complex and here is 
Vladimir Dubrovschik he has the personal best of sixty-eight point eight
zero metres and he's really gone mad because he
obviously has shown he can be a discus to the best stretch 
Well John I think he's happy because that's 
what happened he won look likes the discus edging out the hot
favourite Jurgen Schultz of Germany and over the last ten to fifteen
minutes he has been full of joy and ecstasy 
 He's taken out two or three of his T-shirts and given
them away to the crowd 
And the joy is written clearly all over his face and body 
For a man of his stature top as he is now he is doing the
laugh of honour Vladimir Dubrovschik of the Ukraine 
And what a happy moment this is for him 
Well the Germans have been a great favourite in the discus but
uh it's uh an upset for uh the Germans here 
Jurgen Schultz beaten by his own game Toto of mix one
word 
And that that will be victory ceremony for the men's long
jump
The winner once more a Chinese Lan Jong of China clearing
seven point eight two metres 
So the Chines uh bringing a few surprises John 
In second spot Vladimir Maleiwind of Turkmenistan 
seven point seven seven metres 
And uh taking the bronze uh the jumper from Oman Ahmed 
Obed Bashir seven point four five metres 
So the uh Chinese uh continuing with the success story here at
the Shri Shiv Chattrapati Sports City winning one more gold medal
And uh that's the finish of the women's fifteen
hundred metres which uh ended in victory for the Irish girl Sonia
 O'Sullivan the hot favourite for this event as John describe
earlier on 
Yeah Sonia O'Sullivan has has gone to win 
but I would like to after since she has is in the way to winning
streak at the moment 
And you can see what a lovely play she over through to Roja
Kutty and then third to run and of course two words she was
the only challenger for her and she kept away two words as
well 
That was the women's 
Seven of them in contention 
Three from India Jagjit Singh Tony Verghese and
uh Satbir Singh 
The uh national record is in the name of Satbir Singh
seventy-five point two two
 Let's pick up action in the women's uh uh
long jump 
Elena Govorou of Ukraine she's on your
screen now 
The uh women's uh long jump record the uh meet
record in the name of Lalita Brednaya of Russia six point eight nine
 Let's get back to men's juveline again 
Two of the field events uh going on at uh the same time at
different parts of the ground 
The women's uh long jump and uh the men's
 juveline 
Well we coming on late 
The other meet is coming on now first will be the B wing
And then we come on straight Carl Lewis Emmanuel Tuffour of
Ghana 
Well while we are at the men's juveline uh we
and uh while we did describe about Merelene Ottey holding on to uh 
the women's two hundred metres where uh it was expected from
her 
There has been an upset in men's discus which we announced
earlier on and uh the winner there the official result having
come in is uh Vladimir Dubrovschik in eight metres 
And uh he upset the apple cart with uh Nick Winnie of
Irelend finishing second sixty-one point nine two and uh the German
the world record holder Jurgen Schultz uh in third spot sixty-one point
three eight 
So on a day when Merelene Ottey John held on to the
expected title Jurgen Schultz has lost out
Jurgen Schultz uh did say but he was not in the best
streak of the moment and he was not throwing the seventy-four which
he felt when he set the world record in nineteen eighty-seven 
but uh he himself did not dream that he could throw seventy-four point
zero eight 
And even convinced I beleive for the judges were lying when
they said that that was the world record 
But Jurgen Schultz as I said earlier is alternating between
 grip practices for the discus throw and also in his sports
promotion business because as he said I want to get money because
uh he doesn't make as much money as the Carl Lewis or Sir Jack 
Whooker 
Well John uh the action is now centred at uh 
The hundred metre
 That's right the blue ribband of uh all
athletic races and the name which is uh going to be there where all
eyes are going to be focused is uh the eight times Olympic gold
medal winner and uh the same time that he won the world championship 
uh Carlson Fredrick Lewis better known to all of us as Carl Lewis 
He is uh drawn in the second of the uh men's one
hundred metres 
The uh You have Permit meet record for the
hundred metres in the name of uh Thomas Jefferson another fine U S
athlete set way back in nineteen eighty-nine ten point two zero 
And uh the Indian record in the name of R uh Gyanshekaran 
uh ten point six zero 
 You have 
Now in the first hundred metres which is schedule for now 
you have two Oman runners and in lane three you have Gurvinder Singh
 of India 
Now these 
And I was telling you uh you have two runners from Oman 
in this first three hundred metres race 
And these Oman runners are good uh for the four
hundred eight hundred fifteen hundred but uh these days uh in the
Middle East we are having some of the best best coaches from abroad to
push their talent 
But you could expect uh some of these boys to do well 
in uh the Asian Games at Hiroshima 
This uh first race in the hundred metres of course will be uh
 just uh a teaser for you because in the next one comes Carl
Lewis Patrick Stevens Emmanuel Tuffour Donald and Sherry all great
sprinters today on the grand Prix circuit 
Patrick Stevens of Belgium 
Well John if you remember uh uh there can always be an
upset if you remember one of the first but uh beaten by a lesser known
 Austr Austria 
 Aust 
As uh I as Carl himself said I know that the
contest is going to be very good 
And this boy from Ghana Emmanuel Tuffour running in lane five
 for that kick ten 
And here is the victory ceremony for the eight hundred metres
You have Shiny Wilson the the former record holder for the
event which she lost when Jyoti Mohit Sikdar set the new record at
 the European circuit 
Well there is the winner of the women's eight hundred
metres Natalia Dukhnova of uh Belarus two minutes zero two
point one zero second 
And what a fine run she had sporting the uh very famous
sunglasses uh which has now become a part of International sport 
whether it's athletics football or cricket

And uh Shiny gets a a warm kiss from uh the one who
finished first in the race 
And that's the bronze medal winner uh Cydesen Karen of
Denmark the Dane winning uh coming in third spot two minutes O
seven point three one second 
All squad there in fact everybody thinking as Gurvinder
Singh in the screen from India 
He is one of the upcoming hundred metres runners 
John and this reminds us of uh the man who lit the flame
today uh the man who held his national record and the title for a
long long time Adil Somadiwala isn't it ?
Yeah 
We have a Chinese in lane five 
Now let's see what this Chinese man is going to
do because already the Chinese have shown even with the very
few that have come out to Pune here that uh they have some good
stuff in their country even present uh well uh they are going to
do or not uh well uh I mean uh they have not got of course the best
from out there 
But even those that have come here have done well 
John the Americans have all these uh health way in the 
hundred metres strength for 
Yes of course 
You see has come in 
And of course uh everybody has read that uh Dimple
Christly incidently is also from Jamaica but now uh is uh
settled in England 
And a good one word citizen today 
And another name which we can't forget is Baleri Bourgoef
with one hundred and two hundred 
Yeah the only Russian to be a sprinter which gone
 who has become immortal because he came out at the time when the
American were in full sway 
Rajiv Balakrishnan from India 
He is running in the hundred metres here 
Rajiv Balakrishnan is not on the list of runners but uh
 he is doing the hundred metres free race 
And let's see if he he could come in because he
is training more for the two hundred metres because uh if the Indian
team goes to Hiroshima then Rajiv Balakrishnan will run both the 
fou hundred four hundred metres relay as well as the four hundred
metres uh 
So let's see if he can win this the hundred metres
free race uh in the National games here interruption 
 That's one close start Rajiv Balakrishnan and
 that's Gurvinder Singh in your feature screen 
The Chinese there also 
John and the tension Lying it's not
only on the athletes but everyone out here as well 
 Lying 
Yeah the hundred metre is always does that to everybody 
because that is the race everybody looks ahead to and uh of course
that is a day of great spectacle in any athletic meeting 
anywhere in the world 
There is another Chinese in the second hundred metres race as
well and that is that tall person standing behind in second lane
 waiting for his trial to come over 
And the Chinese in the first year in this race you can
see in lane two 
 That's Merlene Ottey is here 
Sweet talking to the sports men of Slovak Vasnaik 
applause 
It looks like the Chinese in the front here is the great
fight between Korea yes it is looks like that the Chinese China
athlete who has won 
And he did it so nicely one hundred and ten 
Strangely enough his name is not on the list of
competitors
Yeah 
That was Rajiv Balkrishnan in the blue shorts one seven

And here is the replay 
On the first lane is uh Al Maksai Saidewoma and
the Chinese runner down in the middle with Gurvinder Singh 
struggling there to keep in the forefront 
And look at the end as the Chinese runner surges ahead
