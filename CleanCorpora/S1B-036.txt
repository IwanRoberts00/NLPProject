With the end of the cold war  and the dismemberament of the
""
""
""
""
relations between India 
""
""
number of issues had forward our relations 
""
Foremost amongst those 
""
""
place 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  of exchanging
""
""
Dr Singhavi how do you  one word
""
""
""
""
of Indo-British togetherness 
""
""
longer wrangle 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
for each others concerns
""
""
So what is the attitude  in
""
""
""
When I went there I found that  was
considerably confused  in the Labour Party
there was an inadequate appreciation  of
""
""
""
""
""
unambiguous statements 
""
There is no doubt that they are very much concerned  about
allegation of human rights 
""
But there is also no doubt  Kashmir as an
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But I must say in fairness  that Mr Jerim Cockson eventually
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
share a lot of our perspective 
""
""
""
""
""
""
England itself now 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
with the evidence that we have  of our neighbouring
""
terrorist 
""
And we share that openly  with the British government
""
""
Yes this was an issue which was always rankling  uh
""
extremely significant and important one 
""
And I am glad that they do  importance that we
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No  the
""
""
""
""
""
terrorist 
""
""
question of terrorism 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
well pave the way for India 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And our nationals have  uh
creditably 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
They would be a useful catalyst 
""
""
""
""
""
Now  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
before long 
""
But the  has a tremendous contribution to make
""
of contributing to  in our
country
""
""
""
""
""
""
major role 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes 
""
""
On the political side
""
 they are a group of
people  or people of Indian origin I
""
""
""
attention to and I  glad that we are doing so
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
support 
""
""
""
""
And in the modern world diplomacy has to relate to people  and
not only to the government 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
they can 
""
About the other hand 
""
held that today because  in the
""
""
But had to understand that in this recessionary phase  you
cannot have received 
""
""
during the time when our foreign exchange reserves were at the rock bottom
""
""
""
That  or less
""
""
This is the situation to which NRI have made a very useful
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And we have  on
""
investors  that they cannot afford to miss the
""
""
Last year  brought a very large group
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
longer  happening
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah they are 
""
""
""
""
""
concerned  we
""
""
""
word  therefore
everything is there very conducive for  uh increasing this
""
""
Yes we  two countries relate very closely to
each other 
""
This is tremendous awareness of the thing  that the India is a

""
""
""
""
I think during the recessionary phase also  the number of
""
very large 
""
But 
""
""
And we will have to  a little more
""
""
""
""
I am certain that joint ventures between Britain and India would
""
""
""
the reasons you 
""
But I think  during a short
""
""
""
""
There is tremendous positiveness in the climate 
""
It will take some time before we can uh 
""
""
massive 
""
""
""
""
""
""
good-will 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  very major role
""
""
""
""
objectivity  these are the India and Pakistan
""
""
""
""
""
""
would not have imagined  would be the

important visits  would also pave the way for much greater and more
intensive  as also much better
