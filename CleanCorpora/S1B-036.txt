With the end of the cold war and the dismemberament of the
Soviet Union there have been many dramatic changes in the
international scenario 
One of the healthy developments has been the change in the
relations between India and Britain 
As they were our colonial past and after independence a
number of issues had forward our relations 
Foremost amongst those was the question of Kashmir 
Just next month two very significant results are going to take
place 
The British Home Secretary their Home Minister that is Mr
Kenneth Clerk will be coming in the first week of January 
And this visit will be followed by that of the their
Prime Minister Mr John Major 
We have here with us Dr L M Singhavi our High Commissioner
to Britain 
He is here for pre-visit consultations 
And we're going to take this opportunity of exchanging
some views about the significance of the visit 
Dr Singhavi how do you view this visit of what one word
 ?
These visits represents a remarkable new phase 
of Indo-British togetherness 
As the British Foreign Secretary once said we no
longer wrangle about problems 
We sit together and resolved them 
And I think these uh uh that the year and a half 
that is there had experienced a progressive phase for a qualitative
change in that relationship 
We have been trying to resolve problems 
We are trying to evolve that equation which is durable 
and meaningful 
And where we both share or uh view points and we care
for each others concerns
So what is the attitude now as one word in
regard to the Kashmir problem ?
When I went there I found that the situation was
considerably confused partly because I think in the Labour Party
there was an inadequate appreciation of the historical background of
the legal implications and of the ground situation 
Today we have a situation when the shadow Foreign Secretary
 Mr Jack Cunningham called on me some time ago at the High Commission
 held the press conference and made very positive clear-cut 
unambiguous statements with regards to Kashmir 
There is no doubt that they are very much concerned about
allegation of human rights violations 
But there is also no doubt that they regard Kashmir as an
integral part of India 
But this is very different to what the former shadow 
Foreign Minister of the Labour Party said after his visit to India 
He was rather critical about it
Uh well Mr Jerim Cockson was very critical
about us before he came here 
But after he came he had made a considerable change in
the position that he has taken earlier 
But I must say in fairness that Mr Jerim Cockson eventually
came to a position 
Which is very much more favourable to India than it
ever was 
In fact when I went there he used the word occupying part for
India 
When I took exception to it yeah he was good enough
 to say I am extremely sorry that I used that expression 
On the whole during this period not only the Labour Party
 not only the ruling part not only the Liberal Party but the
people as a whole has come to understand our position better 
They sympathise with our opposition much more and they
share a lot of our perspective in these matters 
 Yeah 
To what extent uh would you attribute this uh to
England itself now emerging more and more as a multi 
 multi ethnic community 
Because this was a common base to me that the British uh 
government and people are also very concern of containing religious 
racial and ethnics rights in England 
And therefore they better understand uh the problems
countries like India face 
Uh when uh forces for their own aim try to use religion
 or language or race to try and divide and create conflict 
But that's only one of the many dimensions 
It is an input no doubt
But I think the more direct input in this whole situation
is their coming closer towards understanding of our position 
Therefore it's the question of terrorist 
I decide in to put my case directly as a case has to be put
We decided that they must have a full encounter
with the evidence that we have of the involvement of our neighbouring
country in the export of terrorrism in the funding and training of
terrorist 
And we share that openly with the British government
Yes this was an issue which was always rankling uh
between us and the the signing of the Expression Treaty is an
extremely significant and important one 
And I am glad that they do realize the importance that we
 attach to the type of systems perhaps perceived by us and not
actually happening there 
There assistants that was being given or at least the 
Nelson's eye being turned to the activities of terrorist in uh
in Britain 
Uh how do you uh evaluate this yourself ?
No I put before the British government the
perceptions that both India and Britain are victim states of terrorist
That both of us have to face the situation in a similar
manner and that both of us us must collaborate in meeting
terrorist 
Now Britain came out clearly large and clear on the
question of terrorism 
The question was what do we do about it 
When I reopened what was regarded as a close chapter on the
Extradition Treaty 
And what is more important the agreement on the confiscation
of terrorist related and drug related ethics 
I found for the first time when we had prepared the ground
 and openess and there is activity in Britain 
And we have established a bi-lateral arrangement which may
well pave the way for India to contribute to a global regime 
against terrorism 
This is very healthy very good 
There are sir now also to the economic side
I think that is yeah uh foremost in or mind 
 We'll have such old ancient economic links with
 Britain special ones 
Uh could you give us your own thoughts on this ?
How do you see increase possibilities of increased 
investments from uh British Industries ?
Now I want to put them a little seperate to the NRI 
Because the NRI's have now become extremely important
in England 
And our nationals have really contributed very uh
creditably to the development of Britain's economy 
And they're also greatly interested in India 
Perhaps uh some comments from you on both the sides
 Yeah 
Yes uh first let me speak about the NRI and then the main
stream investment potential from Britain 
Uh to this acronym NRI I've given I've
 spelt it out as the national result of India 
Uh they are a tremendous resource for Indian diplomacy 
Long ago when I was in Parliament in nineteen sixty-two I
took up this issue with the government 
Well the government did not regard it any part of their
obligation to cultivate them or to regard them as Indians
Now I felt that these children of mother India must be
acknowledged because I found that in their heart there was very
deep love and attachment to India 
Now NRI's have done well 
They would be a useful catalyst in our country 
They would like to have a relationship which enables them to
stay where they are and to do something for our country which
they regard also as their mother country 
Now from that point of view they won't one word a
nationality
I have placed several proposals with regard to this
whole concept to one word nationality and how it can be made
operational
I do hope that some decisions should be taken
before long 
But the NRI's has a tremendous contribution to make
both in terms of technology transfer in terms of investments in terms
of contributing to the general climate for investments in our
country
 Yeah 
I would also say I would also say they have a very
major role to play in improving Indo-British relations in general 
 very much because they've become they've 
become fairly active also on the
 Very much 
Yes yes 
On the political side
 And I think they're they are a group of
people whether you call them NRI's or people of Indian origin I
mean this what you call is debatable 
But this group are ones which we should pay very much more
attention to and I I'm glad that we are doing so
 Yes 
 That's true I made this my business to cultivate
them 
Uh a very large significance uh eternal constituency of
support 
Even if I take my job to be a credit to the people of Great Britain
 they are a segment of that population 
And in the modern world diplomacy has to relate to people and
not only to the government 
And they're a very important positive group for India 
But that apart the NRI have also one very important
contribution to make and that is the constant positive projection of
India among the people they live 
And that is something which we cannot do on the same scale as
they can 
About the other hand the main stream investments here 
about which I have great enthusiasm and great expectations or
held that today because of a strong recessionary phase in the
Europian and the British economy 
But had to understand that in this recessionary phase you
cannot have received buoyancy 
On the other hand for instance when it comes to NRI 
during the time when our foreign exchange reserves were at the rock bottom
 ah Britain the sterling area contributed in such an enoromous
measure and such an unexpectedly large way
That today from a reserve of one million or less
which was very small we have a reserve of eight point eight million 
This is the situation to which NRI have made a very useful
contribution 
Now the main stream investors the money managers the
bankers or one word 
But it takes a lot of time 
Britain is not only Britain's financial market is a
world financial market 
And we have been able to make considerable impact on
the city of London on the money managers on the potential
investors to all thing that they cannot afford to miss the
opportunity of investments in India 
Last year Mr Bhandari I've brought a very large group
 of British investors uhm the top of the shares company
 with their chairman their managing directors their financial advisors
then attorney to all see India 
And they went back with nothing but the most positive
and optimistic reform 
It had to take time 
When this recessional the period of one word is much
longer yeah but it's happening
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
Well I would have thought may be because there is a recession
 uh British industries and financial insitutions would be looking our
for other markets and India
Yeah they are 
India is the natural massive market
And we have very weak advantage as far as Britain is
concerned that there is the uh the language is not a barrier we
know each other 
In fact we still adopt their own standard uh we have a one
word their judiciary the one word administration therefore
everything is there very conducive for uh increasing this
Yes we we and two countries relate very closely to
each other and that is very important 
This is tremendous awareness of the thing that the India is a
natural ally India ia a natural country where to go for investments
And this is a tremendous help 
I think during the recessionary phase also the number of
approvals applied for and granted or industries one word is
very large 
But so far as the economic one word is concerned 
it would have to take a little more time
And we will have to one word here a little more
I have also hopes for relocations of industries from Europe
 into India 
I am certain that joint ventures between Britain and India would
be a interesting reality in the world market 
We will do very well if we established these joint ventures for
the reasons you just now mentioned 
But I think you cannot merely add up during a short
period time play 
The results of what we've already achieved 
There is tremendous positiveness in the climate 
It will take some time before we can uh harvest the crops 
Which will come out of this uh ma 
massive efforts that we have made particularly in this 
Well the most important fact that is the question of the
climate 
If it is a climate of understanding and of co-operation of
good-will of wanting to co-operate with each other 
 There'll be other exchanges follow automatically
And I think it is in the interest of both Britain and India
 that we have a much closer understanding with each other 
Uh Europe is going in uh for unification
Here there'll be problems 
But the unification of Europe uh with Britain being a
part of it will create uh both problems 
And I think also opportunities 
And uh relations with Britain would play very major role
not only on the bi-lateral side but also in regard to India's 
co-operation and exchanges with Europe 
At the same time I think that greater understanding greater
objectivity in the a few words these are the India and Pakistan
 is welcome and we see much greater objectivity now 
This is welcome as such the visits of the Home Secretary and
the Prime Minister are going to be extremely significant 
Uh it is also worth noting that even three years ago one
would not have imagined that the British Prime Minister would be the
guest of honour at the Republic Day 
But he is going to be there in nineteen ninety-three 
I have no doubt that he will receive a very warm welcome 
And I also sincerely hope that uh these two uh very
important visits would also pave the way for much greater and more
intensive economic and other exchanges as also much better
understanding between India and Britain
