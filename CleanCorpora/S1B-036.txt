With the end of the cold war  and the dismemberament of the
Soviet Union  in the
international scenario 
""
One of the healthy developments has been the change  in the
relations between India 
""
As they were our colonial past  a
number of issues had forward our relations 
""
Foremost amongst those 
""
Just next month  two very significant results are going to take
place 
""
The British Home Secretary  their Home Minister that is Mr
Kenneth Clerk 
""
And this visit will be followed  their
Prime Minister 
""
We have here with us  our High Commissioner
to Britain 
""
He is here for 
""
And  of exchanging
some views 
""
Dr Singhavi how do you  one word
 ?
""
""
These visits represents 
of Indo-British togetherness 
""
As  we no
longer wrangle 
""
We sit together and resolved them 
""
And I think these uh 
that is there  had experienced a progressive phase for a qualitative
change 
""
We have been trying to resolve problems 
""
We are trying to evolve that equation 
and meaningful 
""
And where we both  and we care
for each others concerns
""
""
So what is the attitude  in
regard to the Kashmir problem  ?
""
""
When I went there I found that  was
considerably confused  in the Labour Party
there was an inadequate appreciation  of
the legal implications 
""
Today we have a situation when  Foreign Secretary
 called on me some time ago at the High Commission
""
unambiguous statements 
""
There is no doubt that they are very much concerned  about
allegation of human rights 
""
But there is also no doubt  Kashmir as an
integral part of India 
""
""
But this is very different to 
Foreign Minister of the Labour Party said after his visit to India 
""
He was rather critical about it
""
""
Uh  was very critical
about us before he came here 
""
But after he came he had made  in
the position that he has taken earlier 
""
But I must say in fairness  that Mr Jerim Cockson eventually
came to a position 
""
Which is  it
ever was 
""
In fact when I went there  he used the word occupying part for
India 
""
When I took exception to it  he was good enough
""
""
On the whole during this period  the Labour Party
 the
people as a whole has come to understand our position better 
""
They sympathise with our opposition  and they
share a lot of our perspective 
""
""
""
""
""
To what extent uh  uh to
England itself now 
""
""
Because this was a common base to me 
government and people are also very concern 
racial and ethnics rights in England 
""
And therefore they  uh the problems
countries like India face 
""
Uh when uh  try to use religion
""
""
""
But 
""
It is an input no doubt
""
But I think  this whole situation
is 
""
Therefore 
""
I decide in to put my case directly  as a case has to be put
""
""
We decided  full encounter
with the evidence that we have  of our neighbouring
country  in the funding and training of
terrorist 
""
And we share that openly  with the British government
""
""
Yes this was an issue which was always rankling  uh
between us  an
extremely significant and important one 
""
And I am glad that they do  importance that we
 and not
actually happening there 
""
There assistants that 
Nelson's  uh
in Britain 
""
Uh how do you  ?
""
""
No  the
perceptions that both India and Britain  are victim states of terrorist
""
""
That both of us  in a similar
manner  in meeting
terrorist 
""
Now Britain  on the
question of terrorism 
""
The question was 
""
When I reopened  on the
Extradition Treaty 
""
And what is more important the  agreement on the confiscation
of terrorist related 
""
I found  when we had prepared the ground
""
""
And we have established a bi-lateral arrangement  which may
well pave the way for India 
against terrorism 
""
""
This is very healthy 
""
There are sir now also to the economic side
""
I think that is 
""
 economic links with
""
""
Uh could you give us  ?
""
How do you see 
investments  British Industries ?
""
Now I want to put them a little seperate to the NRI 
""
Because the  extremely important
in England 
""
And our nationals have  uh
creditably 
""
And 
""
Perhaps  uh some comments from you on both the sides
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  uh first let me speak about the NRI and then the main
stream 
""
Uh to this acronym  I've
""
""
Uh they are a tremendous resource for Indian diplomacy 
""
Long ago when I was in Parliament  I
took up this issue with the government 
""
Well the government did not regard it  any part of their
obligation  Indians
""
""
Now I  felt that these children of mother India must be
acknowledged  in their heart there was very
deep love and attachment to India 
""
Now 
""
They would be a useful catalyst 
""
They would like to have a relationship  which enables them to
stay where they are  which
they regard 
""
Now  a
nationality
""
I have placed  this
whole concept to  and how it can be made
operational
""
I do hope  should be taken
before long 
""
But the  has a tremendous contribution to make
both in terms of technology transfer  in terms
of contributing to  in our
country
""
""
""
""
""
I would also say  very
major role 
""
become fairly active also on the
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes 
""
""
On the political side
""
 they are a group of
people  or people of Indian origin I
mean 
""
But this group  are ones which we should pay very much more
attention to and I  glad that we are doing so
""
""
""
""
""
 I made this my business to cultivate
them 
""
Uh  of
support 
""
Even if I take my job to be a credit to the people of Great Britain
""
""
And in the modern world diplomacy has to relate to people  and
not only to the government 
""
And 
""
But that apart  one very important
contribution to make  the constant positive projection of
India 
""
And that is  something which we cannot do on the same scale as
they can 
""
About the other hand 
about which  or
held that today because  in the
Europian and the British economy 
""
But had to understand that in this recessionary phase  you
cannot have received 
""
On the other hand 
during the time when our foreign exchange reserves were at the rock bottom
 in such an enoromous
measure  and such an unexpectedly large way
""
That  or less
which was very small 
""
This is the situation to which NRI have made a very useful
contribution 
""
Now the main stream investors  the
bankers 
""
But 
""
Britain is not only  is a
world financial market 
""
And we have  on
the city of London  potential
investors  that they cannot afford to miss the
opportunity of investments 
""
Last year  brought a very large group
 the top of the shares company
 their managing directors their financial advisors
then attorney to all see India 
""
And they went back  the most positive
and optimistic 
""
It had to take time 
""
When this recessional  is much
longer  happening
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well I would have thought may be because there is a recession
 and financial insitutions would be looking our
for other markets  and India
""
""
Yeah they are 
""
""
India is the natural  massive market
""
And we have  as far as Britain is
concerned  we
know each other 
""
In fact we still adopt their own standard  one
word  therefore
everything is there very conducive for  uh increasing this
""
""
Yes we  two countries relate very closely to
each other 
""
This is tremendous awareness of the thing  that the India is a
natural ally  country where to go for investments
""
""
And this is a tremendous help 
""
I think during the recessionary phase also  the number of
approvals  is
very large 
""
But 
it would have to take a little more time
""
And we will have to  a little more
""
I have also hopes for  relocations of industries from Europe
""
""
I am certain that joint ventures between Britain and India would
be 
""
We will do very well if we established these joint ventures for
the reasons you 
""
But I think  during a short
period time play 
""
The 
""
There is tremendous positiveness in the climate 
""
It will take some time before we can uh 
""
Which will come out of this uh 
massive 
""
""
Well the most important  fact that is the question of the
climate 
""
If it is a climate of understanding and of co-operation  of
good-will 
""
 follow automatically
""
""
And I think it is in the interest of both  Britain and India
""
""
Uh Europe is going in  unification
""
""
Here 
""
""
But the unification of Europe  a
part of it will create 
""
And I think also opportunities 
""
And  very major role
not only on the bi-lateral side 
co-operation and exchanges 
""
At the same time I think that greater understanding  greater
objectivity  these are the India and Pakistan
""
""
This is welcome  as such the visits of the Home Secretary and
the Prime Minister are going to be 
""
Uh it is also worth noting  three years ago one
would not have imagined  would be the
guest of honour at the Republic Day 
""
But he is going to be there 
""
I have no doubt that he will receive a very 
""
And I also sincerely hope  very
important visits  would also pave the way for much greater and more
intensive  as also much better
understanding
