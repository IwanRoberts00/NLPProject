<I>
Uh you know the University
 A few words as it is
Of course we speak on one or two words 
Uh
So specially when I heard about this Indian English today
morning I felt uh that uh he did not specifically point
out uh what exactly is Indian English 
Because uh in our room there is a Maharashtrian and uh
there is a Punjabi Kannadian Kannadiga and 
 we've some of Telugu speaking people 
But when all of us were speaking conversing in the conversation 
I didn't find much difference one from the other 
But uh in the class room situation sometimes uh we find 
students they're trying to speak in English uh they bring
in that uh Telugu accent but uh they don't have much to refer 
Uh when I teach also whenever I teach use the correct accent
 sometimes I've to come down to their level and uh speak
otherwise they may not be able to learn from this
Yes yes 
They make take up for example word like uh work uh
 you know unless they spell it sometimes they may not be able to read
it up even when I read
 Uh 
So at that level uh sometimes uh a butler 
speaking uh somebody who are influenced by people who are speaking
English picked up words 
Such people when they are speaking there may be some difference
in accent or uh their use in the words 
But generally the educated uh people I don't find much
variation but in uh accent there may be a variation 
So what do you think about that variation ?
Of course I agree with you to so many time 
But still I think the influence of the vernacular language
 is there on Indian English 
For example the latters are not in the habits of 
pronouncing the for example there is a a a 
jocular statement also 
If anyone is going there in the veranda 
if a a Bengali happens to see him he just says
like this He's wandering in the verandah
 
He won't pronounce the V such a differences may be there
Of all all the accents
Accent
That accent may be different
Accent may be different but as far as the language and
other parts are concerned there may not be much difference 
Only accent and intonation may be different because 
every individual is habituated to a particular accent and intonation 
depending upon the vernacular language which he is say have just
habituated to use from the time of birth till the end 
These vocal chords should be adjusted in such a way that
uh they always uh they're in favour of a such a kind
of particular intonation and accent 
 That's why the difference if at all is the
difference is there in Indian English depending on the various
states in this country 
It is mainly as you said it is mainly which is not an
intonation and accent as far as the language part is concerned 
vocabulary is concerned one need not find uh
Naturally you won't find much difference 
So what I wanted to impress upon you is uh the
influence of English on vernacular languages definitely is there 
 yeah 
In even in Telugu sometimes when we use the word like uh
master yes English word
 Yeah 
 Yes 
But it has come down to the level of uh becoming
completely vernacular word master
I know
So that difference is there and I can understand that
And the same way these languages uh might be influencing
English 
And the Indian writers writing in English especially persons
like R K Narayan and uh Raja Rao then come down to one word 
Raja Rao made an experiment
He made an experiment 
Even uh R K Narayan was writing he tried specifically to
bring in Indian humour flavour Indian kind of words in Indian English
Uh so that way deliberately or unintentionally these people
might have brought some words of Indianism or Indian words into the 
literature part 
But Indian English as it is because whole India is filled by
speaking English English in India 
So Indian English as it is gramatically or uh 
vocabulary wise or lexican uh what you call it 
Then I don't mind such difference 
See because uh we were taught only what is the standardise
English 
And you know the newspapers magazines so magazines is just uh
mostly trying to imitate uh American English 
Specially these uh film magazines or uh the one word 
Then American English because they are more uh stylish 
Stylish 
So British English is easier than
Easier because they have brought such a changes which you
which uh which adopt and make you easy
But then uh another kind of uh people we come across these
days uh the children special who are taken in uh uh christian schools
or uh
Missionary
Uh urbanised schools say public schools that we all
know means special group their accent pronunciation is something very
artificial
Yes
You see most note particular group and particular group
they alone can understands what they speak 
But in general if they rightly try to speak to other people uh
those sentences mean their sometimes artifical pronunciation 
 They're trying to drag a new word in the conversation
unnecessary accent and something attracting something 
Means that is another kind of trend which going on
Going on in all Catholics
So another thing is uh they isolate themeselves 
feeling that they are uh quiet superior because they are able to speak so
fluently that language and American American 
language 
So that trend is formed 
But what I what really to grasp from uh from
his lecture from this lecture 
What exactly is the meaning of English ?
Mean how really it differs from this standardized British English
or uh whatever you may call it 
 From his lecture 
 Nei the language as people say there is
nothing like real standard because uh people use it as uh I mean
if you come to Telugu Telugu is spoken in different styles and 
different ways and though we mannerise literature in Telugu and
cinemas in Telugu is using a particular kind of standerdised English
Telugu 
 Yes there's different styles 
That way some people are influenced 
But if you come to a place like uh Hyderabad and it's
 mostly more uh your accent is completely Urdu kind 
When you go to Orissa in uh Berrakpur uh
In Orissa oriya
Oriya is there completely 
When you go to Chittoor definitely you'll find the 
southern influence is there 
See the word completely one word uh one or two
words in Telugu in in Telugu we use it 
 Kannada influence 
Yes so that dialectical differences you find in every
language and otherwise the language cannot survive 
Yeah 
You heard some time ago as you made it into request
But what exactly is Indian English ?
 I'm unable to ring with that 
Yes of course this is how from his speech we would gain
 uh I think one word but to uh we can try and analyse 
Indian English I think it is more identifiable based
on literature other than languages uh I know correct
 Uh I know 
Yeah that's my point
As far as language is concerned uhm we cannot
find much difference except this latest information that are going on
there in in England or in American whose mother tongue is English
Basically the vocabulary grammar part and all those things 
 they they remain constant 
Yet even in those things there may be some slight changes
because their mother tongue is uh English and they are
authorised to bring changes depending upon the daily usage 
 Uhm 
 English 
Whereas it is our cultivated language foreign language 
we are not authorised to bring changes in grammar and all those things
 That's why we remain as we were 
Where did you get those uh wood laws entry the grammar
vocabulary and all those things were uh almost all standardised in a
particular way 
Still we carry on those things without bringing any uh
latest changes 
As far as the language is concerned that's true 
But in my opinion Indian English differs completely in
a way in all literature Indo-Anglican literature 
That makes all the difference uh about this Ind 
Indian English 
Because it cannnot survive without uh literature of course 
What I think is spoken English
If someone has uh gradual tone in his speech
That spoken English
As far as spoken English
Spoken English accent will be different some new words
might have come some of the Indianism might have come in there 
But basically English language as it is I don't think we
can go for transform very much to, branding of Indian English as much as
we brand American English
American English 
There is much difference in American
Because uh they specifically they took a lot of efforts 
they changed it
Intentionally they did it 
Uhm I mean they created their own dictionary 
Means they don't like to call it an American English they want to
call it American language
American language 
But uh i in America also they have various kinds
of influence Spanish language you know mean the Negroes going they have their
own kind of accent 
So even there the difference is there but uh they are
identified themselves with American language 
That way if compared to that I don't find anything uh
very much significant in Indian English 
Uh I think Indians pronounce or the accent of Indians are
much better than the French men speaking English or right yet
 speaking English 
 Yes 
But in the African continent there is a specific uh
influence of their own language and their own accent kind of English 
If you read uh article in English novels you find that
But in India I don't think it has gone to that extent to
brand the Indian English 
May be I don't know anything
Eh no no you are correct totally correct 
What I'm asking is there's no much uh
difference as far as the language part is concerned grammar vocabulary and
all those things are concerned 
We can't find any difference between English English and the
Indian English 
But Indian English English can claim to
be different can claim to be unique basically literature that is
these brought out from here because the whole Indo-Anglican literature is
based mainly of course mainly I have stressed on the
Indian tradition Indian things Indian culture over whatever a piece
of creative creative literature that uh so called Indo- Anglican
literature if you refer to it prose poetry novel whatever it may be 
basically
 Of course 
But there also you have to differentiate uh see if a
person like Naipaul
Uhm
Nobody call him like language might have very much
lived in the west
Yes
Then take another Manohar Mazumdar very much lived in the
 western west and his writing developing means you
don't find much of the Indianism 
Though he treats Indian uh characters in Indian
English but his language and the flow of language I mean you don't
find uh anything convertible like R K Narayan ah means
means they like you let a autobiography of Nehru and autobiography of
Gandhi 
There is a vast difference 
 Nehru's style is something very naturally flowing
