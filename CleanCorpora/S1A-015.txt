<I>
""
""
Uh you know the University
""
""
 as it is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
morning  point
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh in the class room situation sometimes 
""
""
""
""
""
otherwise  they may not be able to learn from this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it up  even when I read
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
variation 
""
So what do you think about that variation ?
""
""
""
""
But still I think  language
""
""
""
pronouncing the 
""
""
If anyone is going there 
if  he just says
""
""
""
""
""
""
Of  the accents
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
other parts are concerned 
""
""
every individual is habituated to a particular accent and intonation 
depending upon the vernacular language  which he is say have just
""
""
""
""
of particular intonation and accent 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Naturally you won't find much difference 
""
""
So what I  the
influence of English on vernacular languages 
""
""
In even in Telugu sometimes when we use the word like  uh
master  English word
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Raja Rao made an experiment
""
""
""
""
Even uh  he tried specifically to
""
""
""
Uh so that way deliberately or  these people
""
literature part 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
English 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which uh which adopt and make you easy
""
""
""
""
or uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
You see most note particular  group and particular group
""
""
But in general if they rightly try to speak to other people  uh
""
""
""
""
""
Means that is another kind of trend which going on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But what I  from
""
""
""
""
Mean how really it differs from this standardized British English
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
cinemas in Telugu  is using a particular kind of standerdised English
Telugu 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if you come to a place like uh  it's
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
southern influence is there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Indian English  identifiable based
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As far as language is concerned  we cannot
find much difference  except this latest information that are going on
""
""
""
Basically the vocabulary 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Whereas it is our cultivated language 
""
""
""
""
""
""
particular way 
""
""
latest changes 
""
""
""
But  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
can go for transform very much to, branding of Indian English  as much as
""
""
""
American English 
""
""
""
""
""
they changed it
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
Means they don't like to call it an American English they want to
""
""
""
American language 
""
""
""
of influence Spanish language you know mean the Negroes going they have their
own kind of accent 
""
So  even there the difference is there but uh they are
identified themselves with American language 
""
""
very much significant in Indian 
""
Uh I think Indians pronounce or  are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But in the African continent  uh
""
""
If you read uh  you find that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Eh no no 
""
What  uh
""
all those things are concerned 
""
We can't find any difference  between English English and the
Indian English 
""
But Indian  can claim to
""
""
based  on the
""
of creative creative literature  that uh so called Indo- Anglican
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
don't find much of the Indianism 
""
""
English  I mean you don't
""
means they like you let a autobiography of Nehru  and autobiography of
Gandhi 
""
""
""
