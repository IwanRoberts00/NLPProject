<I>
""
""
Uh you know the University
""
""
 as it is
""
""
Of course we speak on 
""
""
Uh
""
""
So specially  when I heard about this Indian English today
morning  point
out uh 
""
Because uh  and uh
there is a Punjabi 
""
""
But when all of us were speaking conversing in the conversation 
I didn't find much difference 
""
But uh in the class room situation sometimes 
students  bring
in that 
""
Uh when I teach also  whenever I teach use the correct accent
 to come down to their level and uh speak
otherwise  they may not be able to learn from this
""
""
Yes yes 
""
""
They make take up for example word like uh work  uh
 sometimes they may not be able to read
it up  even when I read
""
""
""
""
""
So 
speaking uh somebody who are influenced by  people who are speaking
English 
""
Such people when they are speaking  there may be some difference
in accent or 
""
But generally the educated uh  people I don't find much
variation 
""
So what do you think about that variation ?
""
""
Of course I agree with you to so many time 
""
But still I think  language
""
""
For example 
pronouncing the 
jocular statement also 
""
If anyone is going there 
if  he just says
like this  verandah
""
""
He won't pronounce the V such a differences may be there
""
""
Of  the accents
""
""
Accent
""
""
That accent may be different
""
""
Accent may be different  but as far as the language and
other parts are concerned 
""
Only accent and intonation 
every individual is habituated to a particular accent and intonation 
depending upon the vernacular language  which he is say have just
habituated to use 
""
These vocal chords should be adjusted  that
uh they always  a such a kind
of particular intonation and accent 
""
""
 if at all is the
difference is there  depending on the various
states 
""
It is mainly as you said  it is mainly which is not an
intonation and accent 
vocabulary is concerned  one need not find uh
""
""
Naturally you won't find much difference 
""
""
So what I  the
influence of English on vernacular languages 
""
""
In even in Telugu sometimes when we use the word like  uh
master  English word
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But it has come down to the level of uh  becoming
completely vernacular word  master
""
""
I know
""
""
So  and I can understand that
""
""
And the same way these languages uh  might be influencing
English 
""
And the Indian writers writing in English  especially persons
like R K Narayan and uh 
""
""
Raja Rao made an experiment
""
""
He made an experiment 
""
Even uh  he tried specifically to
bring in Indian humour  flavour Indian kind of words in Indian English
""
""
Uh so that way deliberately or  these people
might have brought some words of Indianism 
literature part 
""
But Indian English as it is  because whole India is filled by
speaking 
""
So Indian English as it is 
vocabulary wise 
""
Then I don't mind such difference 
""
See because uh  we were taught only what is the standardise
English 
""
And you know the newspapers magazines  so magazines is just uh
mostly trying to imitate uh American English 
""
Specially these uh 
""
""
Then American English because they are more uh stylish 
""
""
Stylish 
""
""
So  British English is easier than
""
""
Easier because they have brought such a changes  which you
which uh which adopt and make you easy
""
""
But then uh another kind of uh people we come across these
days  uh christian schools
or uh
""
""
Missionary
""
""
Uh urbanised schools  that we all
know means special group their accent pronunciation is something very
artificial
""
""
Yes
""
""
You see most note particular  group and particular group
they alone can understands what they speak 
""
But in general if they rightly try to speak to other people  uh
those sentences mean their sometimes artifical pronunciation 
""
 trying to drag a new word in the conversation
unnecessary accent and something attracting something 
""
Means that is another kind of trend which going on
""
""
Going on  in all Catholics
""
""
So 
feeling that they are uh quiet superior  because they are able to speak so
fluently that language and 
language 
""
So that trend is 
""
But what I  from
his lecture 
""
What exactly is the meaning of English  ?
""
Mean how really it differs from this standardized British English
or uh 
""
""
""
""
""
 the language as people say there is
nothing like real standard  I mean
if you come to Telugu Telugu is spoken in different styles and 
different ways  and
cinemas in Telugu  is using a particular kind of standerdised English
Telugu 
""
""
""
""
""
That way some people are influenced 
""
But if you come to a place like uh  it's
""
""
When you go to Orissa  uh
""
""
In Orissa oriya
""
""
Oriya is there completely 
""
When you go to Chittoor definitely 
southern influence is there 
""
See the word  one or two
words in Telugu 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  so that dialectical differences you find in every
language 
""
""
Yeah 
""
You heard some time ago as you made it into request
""
""
But what exactly is Indian English  ?
""
""
""
""
Yes of course  this is how from his speech we would gain
""
""
Indian English  identifiable based
on literature other than languages  correct
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  my point
""
""
As far as language is concerned  we cannot
find much difference  except this latest information that are going on
there in  whose mother tongue is English
""
""
Basically the vocabulary 
""
""
Yet even in those things  there may be some slight changes
because  and they are
authorised to bring changes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Whereas it is our cultivated language 
we are not authorised to bring  changes in grammar and all those things
""
""
""
Where did you get those  the grammar
vocabulary and all those things  almost all standardised in a
particular way 
""
Still we carry on those things  uh
latest changes 
""
As far as the language is concerned 
""
But  in
a way in all literature 
""
That makes all the difference 
Indian English 
""
Because 
""
""
What I think is  spoken English
""
""
If someone has uh gradual  in his speech
""
""
That spoken English
""
""
As far as spoken English
""
""
Spoken English accent will be different  some new words
might have come 
""
But basically  I don't think we
can go for transform very much to, branding of Indian English  as much as
we brand American English
""
""
American English 
""
There is much difference in American
""
""
Because uh they specifically they took a lot of efforts 
they changed it
""
""
Intentionally they did it 
""
""
Uhm 
""
Means they don't like to call it an American English they want to
call it American language
""
""
American language 
""
""
But uh  in America also they have various kinds
of influence Spanish language you know mean the Negroes going they have their
own kind of accent 
""
So  even there the difference is there but uh they are
identified themselves with American language 
""
That way if compared to that  uh
very much significant in Indian 
""
Uh I think Indians pronounce or  are
much better than the French men speaking English  right yet
""
""
""
""
""
""
But in the African continent  uh
influence of their own language and their own accent kind of English 
""
If you read uh  you find that
""
""
But in India  I don't think it has gone to that extent to
brand the Indian English 
""
May be I don't know anything
""
""
Eh no no 
""
What  uh
difference as far as the language part is concerned grammar vocabulary and
all those things are concerned 
""
We can't find any difference  between English English and the
Indian English 
""
But Indian  can claim to
be different  literature that is
these brought out from here  because the whole Indo-Anglican literature is
based  on the
Indian tradition Indian things Indian culture  a piece
of creative creative literature  that uh so called Indo- Anglican
literature if you refer to it prose poetry novel whatever it may be 
basically
""
""
""
""
""
But there also you have to differentiate uh  see if a
person like Naipaul
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Nobody call him like  very much
lived in the west
""
""
Yes
""
""
Then take another Manohar Mazumdar  very much lived in the
 and his writing developing means you
don't find much of the Indianism 
""
Though he treats Indian  Indian
English  I mean you don't
find  means
means they like you let a autobiography of Nehru  and autobiography of
Gandhi 
""
There is a vast difference 
""
""
