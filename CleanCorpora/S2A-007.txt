The contribution of All India Radio the communication in
the country has been invaluable 
However often forgotten are the people and the action behind the
scene that goes in making these programmes 
In other sense to highlight the significant contribution of
these individuals the All India Radio has instituted the Akashwani
annual award to the best radio production and technical excellence is
here 
The awards for the year nineteen-ninety represented at a function
 in the capital's Siri Fort auditorium on the sixteenth of
February 
Here are some excerpts from the function 
It is gratifying that this year too as yesteryears we
have received a large number of entrance 
There were in all two hundred and sixty-four entries in
nine disciplines 
The number of contenstants in the technical arena was also
quite high and the competition formidable 
From this year we have Nasakant award for the
best entry on national integration instituted in the memory of the
valiant broadcaster who led down his life in the course of his duty
Yet another award instituted this year is for the
correspondence of the year award to recognize the contribution of
AIR corrospondents both at home and abroad one word being
one of the important components of the broadcasting activity 
It is my present duty on this occasion to gratefully
acknowledge the commendable efforts put in by the jury 
comprising eminent broadcasters critics journalist and artist 
We in All India Radio are conscious of the vital role AIR has
to play in the lives of the people recognizing the inherents 
sequence for the strong medium 
The greater effectively to the common man and to integrate
local communities AIR has launched local Radio Stations may be a
new trend in broadcasting 
The Assam Radio station which may be termed a one word 
Radio station 
We present a new concept in the broadcasting in India 
Each local radia station will one word needs 
talent and aspiration of the local community 
It allows greater participation by the natives and as far
as the role two words concerned it is for them the modern day
 one word 
Local Radio motivation the masses to strife for better quality of
life in search of freedom for hunger better one word 
adequate housing clean environment good education one word 
health and above all self esteem and dignity 
I once again express my sincere gratitude to all the members
of the jury and especially for the broadcasting 
Shree two words for being with us in this event 
May I now request you sir to address the gathering and
give away the prizes to the winners applaud 
 Shri Shinde Shri 
Bhatikar and distiguished members of the audience 
Today is a proud day 
For radio professionals a day where a good number of them
 will receive the Akashwani Award 
They have won after giving up their best their year's
 best in effort and in excellence 
I am therefore very happy to be in your midst and to
exchange greetings with all of you and with the award winners 
in particular 
AIR has indeed broken new ground in our ideal fields
 and great many strikes 
The gulf war has only added to our challenges even though
 we are not the actual theatre of war 
AIR I must say has reason to be challenge admirably 
by not only providing to the listening public news from the battle
fronts but also by promoting public awareness on the
importance of conserving energy petrolium products one
word economy in national expenditure as well as of 
fighting the evils of hoarding and black marketing 
The media for becoming more and more vulnerable and media
management is therefore becoming increasingly complex 
On the one hand is the paradox of care air time being
available and an insatiable demand for more radio time 
from ever larging ever enlarging an interested groups 
The promoters of anti-cosumerism the environmentalist
 and a host of other social activists 
On the other hand there is the growing recognition 
of the importance of media and their autonomy and a constant threat
 by extremist elements the millitants promoters of violence
 and other anti-social elements to silence the media 
All of us are aware of how this was brought home to us in
the tragic assassination of Lasa Kaur who like Casa Blanca
 the boy on the burning death is too dumb in the cause of 
keeping the transmission on and the media flag flying 
You may even try this when you try to produce better
programmes than your fellow workers your seniors your juniors
 and your equals can do 
This is competition 
Competition is when you perform in comparison with
another 
What you must try for is excellence 
Excellence for its own sake 
You achieve excellence ga by competing with yourself
 and not with another 
You achieve excellence when your sub every subsequent
work is recognized to be greater than your previous work 
I wish you all every success 
Thank you applaud
