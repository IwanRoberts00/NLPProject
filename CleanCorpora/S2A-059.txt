Suddenly pain in the chest occurs unexplained sweating is here
 suddenly or within a few
hours 
""
Now this death 
and this is uh 
""
It means  and
there is no respiration the person is not breathing 
""
So that is but 
""
So till the brain is functioning 
""
He is not really 
""
So 
""
If during this four period of four minutes 
 we can revive the
person we can make his heart beat again and his respiration come up  again
""
""
Now it has been 
for any doctor 
this 
""
You are in the factory you are in the office  you are in the
college 
this sort of thing can happen at any time 
""
Now when it happens  to do
anything 
""
So it is the passerby  the standers-by the people in the house
 and follow the
technique of  C P R that is cardio pulmonary resuscitation
""
It is a very very simple technique  and anybody can learn it
""
""
""
So friends  just learn the technique of
cardio pulmonary resuscitation 
""
By cardio I mean heart  and
resuscitation means revival 
""
Learning the technique  of reviving heart and lungs when it
fails 
""
Before we actually learn  what is C P R or cardio pulmonary
resuscitation is  as
to where the heart is situated 
""
That heart  and is situated
in the centre of the  with the strenum or the breast bone in
front 
""
And uh 
almost trillions of cells of the body  and the main target organs like
brain  the
kidneys liver and heart itself 
""
If the heart fails  the
death ensues 
""
And this death  or what
we call a temporary death  or a permanent
death 
""
The time interval  and the
permanent death 
""
It is this time interval which is crucial  and we have to take
all the measures 
""
Now  it is very very
essential for us to know 
""
If alive  and there
are certain parameters by which we can easily determine  whether the
individual is dead or alive 
""
Like for example  to say ask some question to
the patient  ?
""
If he is not  then we can just
pinch the skin  upper portion of the eyes we
can just have a deep pressure 
""
If there is no response 
uh not in a sleeping state 
""
Now how to distinguish whether he is dead  he is
unconscious 
""
We can easily see  or the breathing
movements 
""
If a person is unconscious we can see there is a breathing movement
or you can bring the palm of your  hand and put it just in front of the
nostrills or over the 
""
""
Or  in front of the mouth and
the nose
""
And if we can  we can say that
the individual is unconscious 
""
And the third thing commonly which we should feel is  we can see
the carotids  which is very close to the adams
apple or what we call as the voice box or a sound box  there is a groove
on the side of this apple 
""
Uh this uh  we can just feel the
pulsation 
""
If we can feel the pulsation  we can say that the individual is
unconscious but not dead 
""
If you are not able to perceive the pulsation  and we say there
are no chest movements no signs of respiration and  uhm uh pulsation or
heart pulsation we can say that the individual is dead 
""
And then we have to keep certain  and
""
""
For example  we should never try to keep a pillow under the
head 
""
Now why it is so  ?
""
The principle is 
""
Whenever a individual breathes he breathes either from the nostrils
or from the mouth  it goes through the
windpipe and goes into the lungs  goes
into the windpipe and the lungs expand 
""
If  for example we just keep for example we are keeping a
pillow under the head  and there is a
narrowing of the windpipe
""
You can see here  this red one this is windpipe it gets choked
 and an
individual instead of saving him  he can just uh go into a sudden death
""
""
So we must make an effort never to put any pillow under the head
""
""
The second thing which we must keep in mind  we can put any
pillow or anything 
""
By doing so  the effect
of  two to three bottles
of blood 
""
And just by doing so  a patient may have a enough circulation
in the brain and he can be easily revived 
""
Just by a simple technique  or raising
the 
""
The third thing  or any
""
""
There is a risk  as the individual is either in a temporory
death or in a permanent death  whatever you put in the mouth will go into
the windpipe  and the windpipe will get choked and there will not be any
passage of air into the windpipe and person may die suddenly 
""
If at all we find  or there are
any secretions  any throat secretions lying in the mouth or there is some
foreign body or there is a  or there is water
accumulated in the mouth our effort should be 
and  or the individual
 or the left
side 
""
The next thing which we must keep in mind is  we must assure
 if
there is a lot of crowd  obstruct the air to go into the patients
uh  vicinity
""
And we should see that there is a free entry of air  into the
individual or who is a victim who is almost in a process of death 
""
So these are certain 
don'ts  which we must keep in mind
""
Once  that still there are no signs
of life  C
P R or cardio pulmonary resuscitation  this can be remembered
 and C
""
By A 
means circulation 
""
Once I say A A  means how to take care of the airway
 by which we can
blow air into the individuals lungs  and C is the
circulation  we can revive the heart which
has failed so as to achieve the circulation in the brain and all the vital
top parts of the body 
""
This is what I meant by A 
""
Now how to  we'll
""
""
The first and the foremost  care of the airway
""
""
Our aim is  to keep this windpipe which you have already seen
""
""
But we must see the patency of the airway or the windpipe 
""
So we have to keep the  in that
fashion  and we can do
so 
""
Means we can give this you have to elevate the chin  and just
""
""
By doing this doing so like chin lift and head tilt position the
wind pipe becomes absolutely patent 
""
This is what I mean by A
""
It is very very simple 
""
And just by doing so atleast twenty percent of the lives can be
saved 
""
""
""
And after doing so if you find 
breathing  then we are not to worry much
about it 
""
And if you find  and
there is no signs of  with another
step of B 
""
Now this breathing 
""
Like uh  or a
mouth to nose breathing 
""
And one should never feel shy  that may be of a opposite sex
may be a male female may be young or a old individual
""
Our aims and objective is only one  to save the
life  irrespective of the sex and irrespective of the age of an individual
""
""
And this can be achieved by  in front of
the  absolutely airtight
seal 
victim's 
""
And we must ensure before doing so that we 
individual's 
""
And the second thing is 
individual's 
""
If we do not do so 
individual's  will leak out from the nose and we will not
achieve the goal 
""
 very very important and simultanously we must watch
for the chest movements  of giving
the air is alright 
""
And if it is not so you will see there are no chest movements 
or there is some leakage of air  or
from the nostrils 
""
And this can be done 
there is only one rescuer  then we have to give a
mouth to mouth breathing by  clinch the
nostrils 
short  victim's
""
""
For example if there is a fracture  or there is a bleeding from
the mouth  or there is some foul smelling
coming from the mouth then you can start with  mouth to nostril breathing
""
""
And our aim is again same our objective is same that we have to
keep  chin
lift 
""
And we have to see that the mouth is closed 
mouth to nostril breathing like this 
""
Once you do so we must always watch  for the chest movements
""
""
If our technique is right  and we will
be sure that we have given the blow or breath  exactly into the wind-pipe
""
""
""
Once you do so  and we find there are still no sings of
breathing there are no signs of uh 
""
By C I mean circulation 
""
Now how to achieve the circulation
""
The technique is very very simple 
""
Like for example you can use your middle finger  and the index
finger 
""
There is a notch here 
""
If you see here carefully 
""
Here the two halves of the  bony
cage they meet
""
This is the notch  the
index finger 
""
Bring the palm of the other hand  and keep it over the breast
bone 
""
Remove this hand  other hand and
interlock it 
""
And you have to make sure  that you give this procedure of
what we call as  or what we call as compressions over
the heart 
""
You have to see that you just lie absolutely in a  straight
position  and you give enough
pressure 
to one and a half inch 
""
We should not go 
""
And you can start giving compression
""
Like for example  one
thosand one  one thousand four
 one
thousand eight  one thousand
eleven  one thousand
fourteen  straight away
start the same position  clinch the nose
""
""
Then continue this procedure  you see the signs of
life  uh circulation
achieved 
""
If you find that still no signs of respirations  we must
continue the technique  carotids artery here main
artery here  or
 some sort of regaining of consciousness
""
If it is not there  we have to continue it there are certain
things which we have to keep in mind  when we do this technique of what
we call as a close cardiac massage
