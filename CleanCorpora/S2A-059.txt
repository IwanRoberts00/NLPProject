Suddenly pain in the chest occurs unexplained sweating is here
 and breathlessness may be there and suddenly or within a few
hours or the same day at any time a person can die suddenly 
Now this death when we say death this is apparent death 
and this is uh clinical death there are various names for it 
It means that the heart has stopped beating say and
there is no respiration the person is not breathing 
So that is but the brain is still functioning 
So till the brain is functioning the man is not dead 
He is not really dead so he is not biologically dead 
So that period is only about four minutes or so 
If during this four period of four minutes before the 
 br brain death occurs we can revive the
person we can make his heart beat again and his respiration come up again
 then the man can be revived and he survives 
Now it has been this period of four minutes is too short 
for any doctor to reach any place because th 
this sort of death can occur at any situation 
You are in the factory you are in the office you are in the
college wherever you are you see wherever you are on the road side 
this sort of thing can happen at any time 
Now when it happens and there no doctor can reach to do
anything 
So it is the passerby the standers-by the people in the house
 who can do everything to save the life and follow the
technique of C P R that is cardio pulmonary resuscitation
It is a very very simple technique and anybody can learn it
 music for sometime 
So friends we'll just learn the technique of
cardio pulmonary resuscitation 
By cardio I mean heart pulmonary means lungs and
resuscitation means revival 
Learning the technique of reviving heart and lungs when it
fails is what we call as cardio pulmonary resuscitation 
Before we actually learn what is C P R or cardio pulmonary
resuscitation is it's uh imperative that we should know as
to where the heart is situated and what exactly is its function 
That heart is just like a size of the fist and is situated
in the centre of the chest with the strenum or the breast bone in
front and the spine or the backbone behind 
And uh it pumps the blood to all the tissues of the body 
almost trillions of cells of the body and the main target organs like
brain which is the master controlling function of the body the
kidneys liver and heart itself 
If the heart fails that is the pumping action fails the
death ensues 
And this death is of two types a clinical death or what
we call a temporary death and a biological death or a permanent
death 
The time interval between this temporary death and the
permanent death is just four to five minutes 
It is this time interval which is crucial and we have to take
all the measures of C P R at this junture 
Now before we learn the technique of C P R it is very very
essential for us to know is the individual alive or dead 
If alive is he sleeping or he is unconscious and there
are certain parameters by which we can easily determine whether the
individual is dead or alive 
Like for example we must try to say ask some question to
the patient are you okay ?
If he is not if it there is no response then we can just
pinch the skin or we can press over the upper portion of the eyes we
can just have a deep pressure 
If there is no response that means the individual is not 
uh not in a sleeping state but he is unconscious or he may be dead 
Now how to distinguish whether he is dead or he is
unconscious 
We can easily see the chest movements or the breathing
movements 
If a person is unconscious we can see there is a breathing movement
or you can bring the palm of your hand and put it just in front of the
nostrills or over the uh mouth and we can fe 
 feel some warmth of the air 
Or we can just bring the cheek in front of the mouth and
the nose
And if we can feel the warmth of the air we can say that
the individual is unconscious but not dead 
And the third thing commonly which we should feel is we can see
the carotids the one of the arteries which is very close to the adams
apple or what we call as the voice box or a sound box there is a groove
on the side of this apple 
Uh this uh uh adams apple we can just feel the
pulsation 
If we can feel the pulsation we can say that the individual is
unconscious but not dead 
If you are not able to perceive the pulsation and we say there
are no chest movements no signs of respiration and uhm uh pulsation or
heart pulsation we can say that the individual is dead 
And then we have to keep certain do's and
 don'ts in mind 
For example we should never try to keep a pillow under the
head 
Now why it is so ?
The principle is I'll just explain you 
Whenever a individual breathes he breathes either from the nostrils
or from the mouth and whatever air he inhales it goes through the
windpipe and goes into the lungs and the air which is inhaled goes
into the windpipe and the lungs expand and the chest moves 
If for example we just keep for example we are keeping a
pillow under the head this windpipe is obstructed and there is a
narrowing of the windpipe
You can see here this red one this is windpipe it gets choked
 and there is no free passage of air into the windpipe and an
individual instead of saving him he can just uh go into a sudden death
So we must make an effort never to put any pillow under the head
The second thing which we must keep in mind we can put any
pillow or anything under the legs 
By doing so wi with the effect
of gravitation we can push in atleast two to three bottles
of blood into the brain 
And just by doing so a patient may have a enough circulation
in the brain and he can be easily revived 
Just by a simple technique of raising the legs or raising
the pelvis of an individual 
The third thing we must never put in any water or any
 sol any solid in the individuals mouth 
There is a risk as the individual is either in a temporory
death or in a permanent death whatever you put in the mouth will go into
the windpipe and the windpipe will get choked and there will not be any
passage of air into the windpipe and person may die suddenly 
If at all we find that there is any vomitous or there are
any secretions any throat secretions lying in the mouth or there is some
foreign body or there is a uh food material or there is water
accumulated in the mouth our effort should be to put in the finger 
and wipe out the whole mouth and keep the patient or the individual
 uh head on the lateral side either on the right side or the left
side whatever is a convenient 
The next thing which we must keep in mind is we must assure
 that there is not a inch of crowd around the individual if
there is a lot of crowd we obstruct the air to go into the patients
uh vicinity
And we should see that there is a free entry of air into the
individual or who is a victim who is almost in a process of death 
So these are certain do's and 
don'ts which we must keep in mind
Once we do so and we find that still there are no signs
of life then we should start the technique of what we call as C
P R or cardio pulmonary resuscitation and uh this can be remembered
 by simple words of A B and C
By A I mean airway and B is breathing and C 
means circulation 
Once I say A A airway means how to take care of the airway
 and B is breathing is the process or the method by which we can
blow air into the individuals lungs to give him life and C is the
circulation that the technique by which we can revive the heart which
has failed so as to achieve the circulation in the brain and all the vital
top parts of the body 
This is what I meant by A B and C 
Now how to do this technique of A B and C we'll
 learn in a step wise fashion 
The first and the foremost A means care of the airway
Our aim is to keep this windpipe which you have already seen
 in that model 
But we must see the patency of the airway or the windpipe 
So we have to keep the victim's position in that
fashion so that the windpipe is absolutely patent and we can do
so by chin lift or head tilt position 
Means we can give this you have to elevate the chin and just
 you have to press back the forehead of the individual 
By doing this doing so like chin lift and head tilt position the
wind pipe becomes absolutely patent 
This is what I mean by A
It is very very simple anybody can learn it 
And just by doing so atleast twenty percent of the lives can be
saved 
 It's such a simple technique 
And after doing so if you find there are any signs of 
breathing or any signs of circulation then we are not to worry much
about it 
And if you find there are no signs of respirations and
there is no signs of uh circulation we should start with another
step of B what we call as breathing 
Now this breathing can be uh learnt in two ways 
Like uh we can give either a mouth to mouth breathing or a
mouth to nose breathing 
And one should never feel shy that may be of a opposite sex
may be a male female may be young or a old individual
Our aims and objective is only one and that is to save the
life irrespective of the sex and irrespective of the age of an individual
And this can be achieved by bringing our lips in front of
the victim's lips and make it a absolutely airtight
seal so that when we blow the air into the patient into the 
victim's mouth it goes straight away into the lungs 
And we must ensure before doing so that we keep the 
individual's position in the chin lift and the head tilt position 
And the second thing is whenever we blow air into the 
individual's mouth we must clinch at the nostrils 
If we do not do so then whatever air is blown into the 
individual's mouth will leak out from the nose and we will not
achieve the goal 
 It's very very important and simultanously we must watch
for the chest movements that is our technique or procedure of giving
the air is alright 
And if it is not so you will see there are no chest movements 
or there is some leakage of air either from the sides of the lips or
from the nostrils 
And this can be done suppose for example if I am alone 
there is only one rescuer instead of two then we have to give a
mouth to mouth breathing by chin lift head tilt position clinch the
nostrils and bring your mouth so you have to give sudden 
short blow of breath into the individual's or victim's
 mouth 
For example if there is a fracture or there is a bleeding from
the mouth or there is a vomitous or there is some foul smelling
coming from the mouth then you can start with mouth to nostril breathing
And our aim is again same our objective is same that we have to
keep the individual's position in the same fashion chin
lift and head tilt position 
And we have to see that the mouth is closed when we give a 
mouth to nostril breathing like this 
Once you do so we must always watch for the chest movements
If our technique is right the chest will move and we will
be sure that we have given the blow or breath exactly into the wind-pipe
 That's how the lungs expanded and the chest moved 
Once you do so and we find there are still no sings of
breathing there are no signs of uh circulation we start with C 
By C I mean circulation 
Now how to achieve the circulation
The technique is very very simple 
Like for example you can use your middle finger and the index
finger you can keep it exactly in the centre of the lower chest 
There is a notch here 
If you see here carefully that is a notch 
Here the two halves of the two halves of the chest bony
cage they meet
This is the notch here you have to keep your fingers the
index finger and the middle finger 
Bring the palm of the other hand and keep it over the breast
bone 
Remove this hand and put it over the other hand and
interlock it 
And you have to make sure that you give this procedure of
what we call as heart massage or what we call as compressions over
the heart to revive it 
You have to see that you just lie absolutely in a straight
position you do not bend your elbow joints and you give enough
pressure so that there is a compression of about half inch 
to one and a half inch just indepth 
We should not go beyond that 
And you can start giving compression
Like for example you can give compressions like this one
thosand one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four
 one thousand five one thousand six one thousand seven one
thousand eight one thousand nine one thousand ten one thousand
eleven one thousand twelve one thousand thirteen one thousand
fourteen one thousand fifteen and after doing so straight away
start the same position chin lift head tilt position clinch the nose
 and give mouth to mouth breathing 
Then continue this procedure till you see the signs of
life in the form of respiration or in the form of uh uh circulation
achieved 
If you find that still no signs of respirations we must
continue the technique till we feel the carotids artery here main
artery here or we see some sort of breathing and the pa or
 some sort of regaining of consciousness
If it is not there we have to continue it there are certain
things which we have to keep in mind when we do this technique of what
we call as a close cardiac massage or a compression
