Suddenly pain in the chest occurs unexplained sweating is here
""
""
""
""
and this is uh 
""
""
there is no respiration the person is not breathing 
""
So that is but 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now it has been 
""
""
""
""
""
this sort of thing can happen at any time 
""
Now when it happens  to do
""
""
So it is the passerby  the standers-by the people in the house
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fails 
""
Before we actually learn  what is C P R or cardio pulmonary
""
to where the heart is situated 
""
""
""
front 
""
And uh 
almost trillions of cells of the body  and the main target organs like
""
kidneys liver and heart itself 
""
""
death ensues 
""
""
we call a temporary death  or a permanent
death 
""
The time interval  and the
""
""
It is this time interval which is crucial  and we have to take
""
""
""
""
""
If alive  and there
""
""
""
""
""
""
If he is not  then we can just
""
can just have a deep pressure 
""
""
uh not in a sleeping state 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if we can  we can say that
the individual is unconscious 
""
And the third thing commonly which we should feel is  we can see
the carotids  which is very close to the adams
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
heart pulsation we can say that the individual is dead 
""
""
""
""
""
head 
""
""
""
""
""
Whenever a individual breathes he breathes either from the nostrils
""
windpipe and goes into the lungs  goes
""
""
""
pillow under the head  and there is a
narrowing of the windpipe
""
You can see here  this red one this is windpipe it gets choked
""
individual instead of saving him  he can just uh go into a sudden death
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of blood 
""
And just by doing so  a patient may have a enough circulation
""
""
""
""
""
The third thing  or any
""
""
There is a risk  as the individual is either in a temporory
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and  or the individual
""
side 
""
""
 if
""
uh  vicinity
""
""
individual or who is a victim who is almost in a process of death 
""
""
""
""
""
of life  C
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
top parts of the body 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Our aim is  to keep this windpipe which you have already seen
""
""
But we must see the patency of the airway or the windpipe 
""
So we have to keep the  in that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And just by doing so atleast twenty percent of the lives can be
saved 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if you find  and
""
step of B 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
may be a male female may be young or a old individual
""
Our aims and objective is only one  to save the
life  irrespective of the sex and irrespective of the age of an individual
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
individual's  will leak out from the nose and we will not
achieve the goal 
""
 very very important and simultanously we must watch
""
the air is alright 
""
""
or there is some leakage of air  or
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For example if there is a fracture  or there is a bleeding from
""
coming from the mouth then you can start with  mouth to nostril breathing
""
""
And our aim is again same our objective is same that we have to
""
lift 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
breathing there are no signs of uh 
""
""
""
Now how to achieve the circulation
""
""
""
""
""
""
There is a notch here 
""
""
""
""
cage they meet
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
interlock it 
""
And you have to make sure  that you give this procedure of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
thosand one  one thousand four
""
thousand eight  one thousand
""
""
start the same position  clinch the nose
""
""
Then continue this procedure  you see the signs of
""
""
""
If you find that still no signs of respirations  we must
""
artery here  or
""
""
""
things which we have to keep in mind  when we do this technique of what
