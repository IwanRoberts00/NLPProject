And a nice make-up kit also 
Oh really
And in the afternoon we went to Poona Poona city
because he's staying twenty-five kilometres away from Poona 
Uh uhn 
Then they had many
So how many days did you stay there 
I stayed there for ten days 
How much did you study there 
 You'd been for study there
Yeah but then I didn't study much 
As I kept falling sick didn't sit I didn't
She has got to the trip for falling sick only
So you had good health for eight days or so 
Ah uhm 
So what did you do 
Kept waiting for you 
Ah 
You must have done something useful you no
I mean I've been to Shirdi
Ah Shirdi uhm so 
I came back with the 
 At shirdi na it's uh
uh Shi Saibaba's shrine 
 Right 
Is there any other god other than Saibaba
No in Shirdi no 
This is Shir di Saibaba
Saibaba I've I've 
heard that 
You have heard about it
Very powerful no 
Actually he is a I think he's a m his
religion is unknown uhm uhm 
His uh
 Uhm uhm 
 What's his actual story 
Which story behind him
He was just some saint moving around having uh
alms and all uhm 
And he used to help people poor people around
Once a he used to celebrate diwali at his
place 
Too much uh with too much of lighting lighting of the lamps
and all
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm
 O once one year British Government refused to
give oil 
Uhm uhm 
And he asked these cough people You 
put water instead of oil 
So people said ki water how will it
burn 
He put uhm they put water and then he he
said okay now burn like that 
So they light the lighting of the lamps with water uh
 on diwali made him very much famous
 Uhm 
 Uh 
Uhm I see that's how he's one word
 and from them
The Lata Mangeshkar is the person who has uh personally
seen him
Uhm uhm
One of my aunty who's personally seen him
She is no more now she died last year i see 
 She's personally seen that fellow uhm uhm 
They used to go to that saint
 I see 
 Uhm uhm 
When did he first arrive 
No in the nineteenth century only uhm I
think
 Uhm 
And uh uh this he had predicted about uh Lata
Mangeshkar being too famous you know uh 
In fact uh she is the prasad that uh
god has given to you told his mother her mother actually 
uhm got it
 Uh 
 Uhm 
This is the basic story about him
And I think even my father experienced he never believes in
many god but he believes in the Saibaba 
Uhm 
Well he had to collect too much of funds in the office
only he has put office only 
The party that didn't seem to be giving money and all 
We were passing through Shirdi and he just said that if uh fair
work is no more uhm 
We have to accomplish the back uhm I will come to you
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
I see 
And those party that party which never gave money 
 uhm gave shelled out money like that 
 Uhm 
Shelled out 
He came back and then he said two words 
But actually my father never believes in 
What about you you are a firm believ believer 
Firm believer I told you no after coming like 
we've seen about this Saibaba from one word 
Uhm 
As you like do you know Tamilians give more importance to
this Saibaba of their south Indian gives importance to the Bangalore
Saibaba uhm 
 You've heard about him na 
 Uhm 
Yes I've heard of him
Uhm that but then we don't believe in ah 
We believe in direct contact with God 
 Ah 
No does it seem
 It's just like that so there are lot of
followers in Trivandrum specially Saibaba's this
But
Bangalore Saibaba and that I've heard 
I've heard many stories about his far and this thing you know 
Oh like 
From his main devotees of course they have very good
stories about him
But from other people I have heard bad stories also about the
Saibaba 
So anyway we uhm we prefer to remain neutral on this
subject as such you know 
No but uh even I have heard but I have heard only good
events 
Uhm got it
Just like about Rajneesh 
Ah Rajneesh I know him 
 Devout neg negative
Right right
See even about him quite it is quite negative like 
He is also using like something about his political powers and all
that Chandraswami then again
 Ah ha Chandraswami 
But then like we don't go to that Sai you know please if you
want to follow that's fair like yeah present 
 Yeah 
 It's only that we don't interfere 
But those people who've actually established
themselves this uh at this Saibaba
Uhm uhm 
He said he is a one word because he never had money
he never had power
Right that's the thing that's the thing
we need
Then the moment he died
Uhm uhm 
And when he died they were saying was Hindus fought 
that he was a Hindu 
Mohammedans fought that he was a Mohammedan and now what to do
with that
I see 
When they came back to his grave 
 Uhm uhm 
They removed that cloth that cloth garment garment
and uh saw 
There was uh no body there was only flowers 
So half flowers were taken in bunch uhm uhm 
and half flowers were put in Mazar that Mazar
 is made in like uh Shirdi 
 Uhm uhm 
Oh that's it 
And now they have uh literally shown that uh uhm direct
telecast uh everywhere in every corner of the temples you know 
 ah they are having uh T V 
 Ah 
Oh yes
 They've shown the whole pooja going
on uhm in the temple 
Uhm they have arrangement about it carrying of the Palanquin
 uhm uhm nine fifteen to ten pm 
I stayed uh by nine I had finished uhm so I thought
 I will wait then I just couldn't wait because because I'll
 miss the bus
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm 
How many hours does it take to go there 
Twelve hours 
Twelve hours 
Near near if you have a vehicle you can uh reach
within eight hours
Uhm uhm 
 Eig not eight nine hours nine nine
 Over night journey 
Over night you'll manage 
Eight thirty you start from here uhm you'll 
reach Poona at four no yeah 
Then from Poona you go to Ahmednagar three hours journey 
 uhm uhm it's about four and a half hours
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Uhm uhm 
Ah do we get straight uh buses from here direct buses
Direct bus is eight thirty bus is here 
Evening evening bus
Morning morning eight thirty
Yeah
Night ten O'clock a bus is there but it is 
inter- state bus 
So very difficult to get that 
But you can go by this uh bus also at nine uh eight
eight thirty 
Go at eight thirty and uh reach by about eight 
O'clock uhm and it's better you know and
you get a chance to come back on very same day 
 Uhm 
Yeah that's right
Because ten at ten O'clock there is a bus coming
from uh Kopargaon to Hubli 
Right
Inter-state
Uhm
And it's for five minutes stay there stand there
So how long did you spend there 
Just one hour or two hours or so 
Ah one hour
Uhm uhm
We caught we caught the next bus came 
You got the bus and came back 
 It's because I was alone and I've got some
company in Shirdi uhm 
They I can mean of coming in the morning na
 so alone means
 Uhm 
 Right 
How this place is Shirdi 
Uh in the sense 
Uh either like uh business other than that 
other than being no its Saibaba's place or it is
developed or 
 Business 
 No its 
Before it is Saibaba's place it was too
different too much now a five star hotel was there
 It become developed 
Really
They are making more arrangements
Not bad
Beautiful buildings now
Uhm uhm 
And quite a lot changing you know
Uhm uhm
The all office buisness people are business
people 
They loot out uhm too much
 Office 
 Uhm 
And other people 
So it's a well developed place no
Yes it is 
Now it's well developed place before it was not
To like it you know about that place through the Saibaba
only 
Hey you know I don't watch movies and others 
right other than that I've never heard of this place at all
 It is famous place 
And there's one more place it's called
 Shaneshwar math form here 
Uhm
That uh village got a speciality uh 
And that is being tested my my father was in one word 
and said 
He was going on tour some driver told ki 
here there is a place uhm 
No robbers and no one came do robbering robbery
 over that place
 Uh 
 Uhm 
Vow 
And if somebody robs or something uhm uhm 
from this village uhm and after seventeen kilometer 
circumference of that village uh he'll go blind 
And until he replaces the thing he can't get his eyes 
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uh 
That is that day
And uh many examples have been cited but uh I don't
know whether it's true or not 
Only thing true is that my father went to the village 
 uh 
He saw uh the house that was having just a door to
keep the cats and uh dogs away from the house 
No lock no house was having a lock 
He went inside the house 
Old man he saw the old man and he got up saw him because he
didn't recognise my father so he went to sleep back again 
 Uhm 
Ahn uhm
He he knows that nobody can take out anything 
Yes that's also world for this place to be invited
Uhm that's true 
This uh same story I've heard is in Trivandrum there is a
temple uhm uhm goddess goddess temple it's 
called a Archaga devi temple 
And there also we've heard stories like uh two men
trying to get in 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
And uh these two robbers you know suddenly they got in the
temple trying to steal the goddesses you know deity as such 
And then suddenly they were blind and 
And the main priest of this temple in his dream you know
 like it it's as if goddess came to him and said see
there are robbers in the temple go fast 
He went he saw these two men you know and they were lying down
blinded 
They were you know motionless as he didn't know what to do 
Then immediately he called the police and they were caught
See no robbery can take place uhm in that
temple as such 
 Uhm 
So which is that temple 
 Archagadevi temple 
 Archagadevi 
Yeah it's very very powerful also
 Nei and we feel there is nothing like
something like God but there's something some superpower
 But there is you know there is there is 
Even in Ajmer you know uhn what you go and
tie a thread uhm 
And you say what you want 
 Uhn 
 Uhm 
Uh you mean uh the one uh the temple
where you can tie a thread around a tree or something like that
 Mean there're 
Uhm
 I've seen that only in movies
I told you know how these things
 It's there it's there in Ajmer you know
It is 
Uh it is actually uh Moinuddin Chisti and Ak Ak
 Akbar made that uh mazar and a temple there 
 uh uh <,. Masjid you call that you know uh
 and that's too famous 
You go uh you want you want to tie 
and when it is full you turn back and fulfilled you come back 
 Uh uh 
 Uh 
 Uh 
 Tie 
Oh it's like that
And people believe that it is like it is true 
And even in Vaishnavadevi uhm 
north you know they say we hear in that all this no they say until
and unless you are not called you can't go I see 
Cannot go if any body wants to go also you'll meet with
an accident something will happen 
 Uhm 
 I see 
 It's like that
Uhm I mean you just can't go
Why can't we Still going on
Uhn
I doesn't mean a few words 
There also people say like 
You can go only when the goddess wants you and there's
 one more uh area called Garbyodh 
And even a fat person double fat uh anybody even that Sumati
 you've seen no 
If uh she's pure bhakt 
She wants to cross she will cross 
And even if a slim person like you any slim lady you can take
also even if you take Jayshree for sake she goes she cannot go 
 There's a big or you can go go inside and 
you've to come out 
If you come out uhm if you go and come out 
uhm that means uh you are a very pure person in heart like
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Pure person at heart means uhm you really haven't done
anything bad and you just you've got a free free from this life
but after that there'll be no life for you like no more births
They speak of the deeds
Yeah yeah
After this there's going to be no re 
reincarnation
Ah I see
