""
Ah Shirdi uhm 
""
""
I came back 
""
""
 uh
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Is there any other god other than Saibaba
""
""
No 
""
This is Shir  di Saibaba
""
""
Saibaba 
heard that 
""
""
You have heard about it
""
""
Very powerful no 
""
""
Actually he is a  his
religion is unknown 
""
His uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Which story behind him
""
""
He was just  uh
alms and all 
""
And  poor people around
""
Once  at his
place 
""
Too much  lighting of the lamps
and all
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
 one year British Government refused to
give oil 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And 
put water instead of oil 
""
So people said  how will it
burn 
""
He put  he
said 
""
So they light  uh
 made him very much famous
""
""
""
""
Uhm  one word
 and from them
""
""
The Lata Mangeshkar is the person who has  uh personally
seen him
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
One of my aunty  personally seen him
""
She is no more now she died last year 
""
""
""
They used to go to that saint
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
When did he first arrive 
""
""
No  I
think
""
""
""
""
""
And  uh Lata
Mangeshkar being too famous you know 
""
In fact  that uh
god has given to you 
uhm  got it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is the basic story about him
""
And I think  he never believes in
many god but he believes in the Saibaba 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Well he had  in the office
only he has put office only 
""
The party that didn't seem to be giving money and all 
""
We were passing through Shirdi and he just said that if uh  fair
work is no more 
""
We have to accomplish the back  I will come to you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I see 
""
""
And those party 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Shelled out 
""
""
He came back and then he said 
""
But actually my father never believes in 
""
What about you 
""
""
Firm believer 
we've 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
As you like do you know Tamilians give more importance to
this Saibaba  of their south Indian gives importance to the Bangalore
Saibaba 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes  heard of him
""
""
Uhm 
""
We believe in direct contact with God 
""
""
""
""
""
No does it seem
""
""
 so there are lot of
followers in Trivandrum specially  this
""
""
But
""
""
Bangalore Saibaba 
I've 
""
""
Oh like 
""
""
From his main devotees  of course they have very good
stories about him
""
But from other people I have heard bad stories also about the
Saibaba 
""
So anyway  remain neutral on this
subject as such you know 
""
""
No but uh  even I have heard but I have heard only good
events 
""
""
Uhm got it
""
""
Just like about Rajneesh 
""
""
Ah Rajneesh 
""
""
 negative
""
""
Right right
""
""
See even about him quite it is quite negative like 
""
He is also using like something about his political powers and all
that  Chandraswami then again
""
""
""
""
But then like we don't go to that Sai you know please  if you
want to follow 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But those people  actually established
themselves this  uh at this Saibaba
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
He said he is a  because he never had money
he never had power
""
""
Right  the thing
we need
""
""
Then the moment he died
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And when he died they were saying was 
that he was a Hindu 
""
Mohammedans fought that he was a Mohammedan  and now what to do
with that
""
""
I see 
""
""
When they came back to 
""
""
""
""
""
They removed that cloth that cloth  garment
and uh 
""
There was uh no body there was only flowers 
""
So half flowers were taken in 
and half flowers were put in  Mazar
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh 
""
""
And now they have uh literally shown that  uh uhm direct
telecast 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh yes

""
And until he replaces the thing 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

That is that day
""
""
And  uh I don't

Only thing true is that 
""
""
He saw  door to
