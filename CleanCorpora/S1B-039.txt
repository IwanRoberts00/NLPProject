<I>
Mr Boris Yeltsin of Russia had an extremely successful
visit to India last week 
And such were the one word reception he got in the
central hall of Praliament when he addressed that August body that
people were asking whether he is more popular in India than he is
back in Russia 
During his visit he signed ten agreements 
And it appeared that the old relationship between India and
the Soviet Union which has collapsed with that counrty 
Now there appeared to be a new beginning with the new Russia 
Now obviously Russia is not the Soviet Union 
 India's relationship with Russia has to be on a new
basis uh completely different basis from that with the old Soviet
Union 
To discuss this we have with us two distinguished panelist 
They are Mr Jagjeet Singh who is the director of the
Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis 
We have Mr Vijay Karan former Director of the CBI 
Jagjeet tell us over all in the ter te 
 terms of structuring a new relationship between the two
countries 
In terms of the totality of the vision where do you think we
stand with Russia ?
And how is this different from the old relationship with the Soviet
Union ?
Well I think obviously as you mentioned very rightly 
 tha that there is something we also need to
keep reminding ourselves that there is no Soviet Union 
Uh this is uh not totally a new country but substantively 
new leadership new system new approaches have and which has 
substantial amount of domestic problems the economic social political
Uh in the larger context of course it remains one of the 
key uh great powers of the world much depends on how it's
 own cohesiveness in all respects shapes up 
Uh but what what would have imagined uh Swami that uh given the
nature of the previous relationship and the fact that most of the people
still are similar and the some fundemental uh
geo-political realities 
In fact this sort of visit should have taken place much earlier
But still I think uh uhm coming as it does it is time does
reflect hopes return to realism in Moscow as well as a certain amount of
 fresh thinking on both sides to to look at this relationship and try
to build it up uh with the changed circumstances on the changed
parametres 
Yes in fact I think the internal affairs ministry had
made an official announcement about Boris Yeltsin coming almost one year ago
 That's right
And he never came and it was a matter of some embarassment 
And I think a very large number of people had come to the
conclusion look this is a terrible mistake Mr Boris Yeltsin
 no longer heads a super power he now head merely a poor country
 and a one word of Europe 
That his main priority right now is to get as much aid and other
systems as he can get from the USA from Europe investment if he
can from Japan 
And that he is now going to be in the struggle to re-establish
himself with the West and Japan and that he is no longer going to
worry about old geo-political strategy which made India a national
ally of the Soviet Union 
And yes now that he has come in a sense people are once again
 getting a whip of old nostalgia saying haan 
 that even if it's not quite the same love affair can we
atleast hold hand 
Uh Mr Vijay Karan how do you see this new affair developing
 ?
 Haan 
Well I agree with you there were there was a state of
uncertainty before he came because of the announcement that he will come
earlier but he didn't come 
At least that uncertainty has been re 
removed and his visit has shown a certain degree of
keenness on the part of the Russian to continue good relations with India
Otherwise I doubt them first 
The Russians would have been so forth the Russian President for
instance so forth right on India's territorial integrity on
 the Kashmir on Pakistan etcetera
So I think also I would rather take the first step Russia
when you think in terms of uh may be uh another regional grouping in
in the long term if it one word off
The emerges of any other threat in Islamic law emerging in the
 one word in the horizon or the western powers again there are
some problem
So may be they wants want to keep
India on the right side you know good relationship India a good
relationship with India as as a long term measure 
It is interesting point you're raising 
Alright suppose Russia feels some kind of threat from an Islamic
block what role would it expect India to play then 
Well may be if let's say an Islamic block
emerges and it it becomes enemical to India because of say
Pakistan or Bangladesh or together they
Otherwise I do not see an Islamic block really posing a
serious threat to India
But because of Pakistan and Bangladesh if it poses a threat to
India and if it also poses a threat to Russia than there are there is
we can do something one word 
Jagjeet do you think I mean there was an old 
ge geo-political relationship based on the USSR
as a global power yes actually Russia is not a global power
 and yet there is a point which Vijay has just said about the
potential of trouble in Central Asia 
Uh which is an area which so to speak divide Russia from
India 
Do you think this have a serious issue uh which has agitating
minds in Moscow and does it have anything to do with the new relationship ?
 Yes 
Uhm well yes and n n no 
 in the sense that yes there is a different sort of perception about
Central Asia uh let's say about a year ago in Moscow 
Uh but I don't think that's the reason for uh the 
type of attempt to build up a new relationship
It is perhaps just one more factor in that 
Uh the the fundamental has not really change 
Russia in fact they are not one or two words global
power just any way except the United States
From from their point of view especially particularly in that
respect so 
Uh that way it is not too difficult to look at Russia uh
more in the nature of uhm another great country uh great power 
whatever terms you want to use it which has not only its own interest
but which needs to co-operate with the larger number of uh centres of
powers and areas and regions uh then just Japan uh North America and
and West Europe and that's realism I was talking of
That there is a return to realism which then uh makes the
whole thing possible to establish a new relationship 
Central Asia is certainly an important point 
But not that that that's the driving force I I won't
say it's the driving force 
Well I said that because I think the Russian President did
mentioned that may be Russia China and India could emerge as
a force together and could work together that's what he
mentioned in the press conference
Well much depend that one word certain significant
 You'll know that the number of people who were very
upset in India with the end of the cold war threat 
 We'll now be in a uni-polar world dominated by the USA
Alas Rus the Soviet Union is no
more 
Some of the thing to be getting excited about Russia I think or
perhaps we will no longer be a uni-polar world perhaps we'll be
able to use Russia or some other people 
Ally with them or with you're searching a broader
 group along with China 
But does it is is that realistic ?
I mean is there any sense in which the uni-polarity of the world
I mean I don't think the world is really uni-polar but
clear 
 To the extent 
Right to the extent that the the USA is substantial 
doc uh if not do not completely dominant power 
Do you think Russia can be used by us in any sense
 to break whatever dominancy USA may have ?
Well first of all uh uh as you've said I mean 
I'm one of the people who believes that there was never this thing
called a uni-polar world
I one or two words 
Except the United States always always even during the
cold war held the primacy amongst states and that primacy continues 
And the question was Soviet Union has uh created a capability
mostly military to countervail that that one
So that's one that has disappeared 
What he take the military power and the balance of power
unfortunately was being seen in terms of military power
Once you take that factor away then you will start looking at
the uh strategic and security economic political interest of states 
Uh I personally if I think which which we're which mean
inclined to look at this issue from the point of view can we use a
country of against different country
I I think there are natural areas on which co-operation
will take place whether the scope of co-operation is greater let us
say between Russia and India than it could be between Aryo -
Russia and United States or India and the United States 
Uh if the the whole uh thing is there is in a way uh
you know prosperity has become one of the new urgent necessity
throughout the world in Russia and India and in whole of Asia and
even in the United States for that matter 
And that's been altering the the whole structure 
I think that we need to look at the whole situation more in
terms of areas on which co-operation will continue and areas on which 
 they there will be differences of opinion 
Our challenges are really how best to strengthen the areas of
co-operation whether it is United States or with Russia or China or Japan or
whatever 
And to ensure that the areas of differences or divergences 
 do not are not allowed to become uh sources of
controversial matter that's that's the only way of I look
at it
Yes fine
I mean as it's very very clear that there is no
sense in which India can aligned itself with Russia against the USA
I mean Jagjeet has gone out of his way to say any friendship
 we've is not you can not be aimed against anybody else
 Haan 
Okay lets get to some nuts and bolt of the agreement
signed here and of the specific policy statements made by Yelstin here
The obvious one is Kashmir 
Earlier there was considerable uncertainty as to what was going
to be Russia's new position 
We had even indicated if I'm not mistaken sometime ago 
are don't expect that we shall continue what the Soviet
Union use to do 
And yet it would appear during his visit here unambiguously
came out with support to the Indian position 
Two questions first does it make any difference ?
In other words given that the USA has given one word
 to India's position various other all security council were
driven to India's position 
Does it really make much of a difference that Mr Yelstin has
 one word around to one word 
Question question number two uh since this is clearly a message
in trying to get through to us 
What is their willingness which take the climate which we can
capitalize on ?
Mr Vijay Karan
Yeah I think that the first question that is about uh
Doesn't matter
Uhm the fact matter because you can't uh wish away I mean
the Soviet Union is not irrelevent I mean it's one mustn't
obtained that after the break up of the Soviet Union Russia has become
irrelevent
As you mentioned it's still a strong military power 
because as member of the United uh Security Council that does count
in the world
It might be weak economically
 A few words it's own problem
 A few words 
And uh apart from the Russian the American the
American question is there on what they want from Pakistan for instance
Pakistan has I mean U USA 
has sent a signal to Pakis a clear signal to Pakistan on terrorism
If a similar signal can go from the Sovi 
from Russia to Pakistan
 That's a few words 
Yes it is good uh I think we need to move on to 
one word somewhere to centre pace of the visit 
This should be the resolution of the rupee 
 rubel dispute between the two countries 
And I think if this had not been resolved co-operation and
trade co-operation military measures would have been held up 
And this is such a complex affair that it might be a mistake
to get too deeply into it 
But as I understand this extremely complex affair roughly
twenty percent uh of the increase in the rupee value
which should have taken place after December thirty first nineteen
ninety-one has not taken place 
To that extent there is a kind of rise of thirty percent of the
debt which nobody is talking about 
 One word were given not talked about 
Of the debt that remains roughly one third has been 
reschedule on extremly softer terms 
Where our debt servicing liability comes down by about two
third 
This has been held as an arrangement that is fair to all and
 will arrange will enable our bilateral relations now to go ahead on
the trade side on the credit side on the defence side
