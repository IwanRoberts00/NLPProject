Mr Boris Yeltsin  had an extremely successful
visit to India last week 
""
And such were  reception he got in the
central hall of Praliament when he addressed that  that
people were asking whether he is  than he is
back in Russia 
""
During his visit he signed ten agreements 
""
And it appeared  between India and
the Soviet Union 
""
Now there appeared to be a new beginning with the new Russia 
""
Now obviously Russia is not the Soviet Union 
""
 has to be on a new
basis  from that with the old Soviet
Union 
""
To discuss this we have with us 
""
They are  the director of the
Institute 
""
We have Mr Vijay Karan 
""
Jagjeet 
 of structuring a new relationship between the two
countries 
""
In terms of the totality of the vision  where do you think we
stand with Russia  ?
""
And how is this different from the old relationship with the Soviet
Union  ?
""
""
Well I think 
 there is something we also need to
keep reminding ourselves that there is no Soviet Union 
""
Uh this is uh 
new leadership 
substantial  amount of domestic problems the economic social political
""
""
Uh 
key  it's
""
""
Uh but what what would have imagined uh Swami that  uh given the
nature of the previous relationship and the fact that most of the people
still are similar  uh
geo-political realities 
""
In fact this  sort of visit should have taken place much earlier
""
But still I think uh uhm  does
reflect hopes return to realism in Moscow  as well as a certain amount of
 to look at this relationship and try
to build it up  uh with the changed circumstances on the changed
parametres 
""
""
Yes in fact I think  had
made an official announcement about Boris Yeltsin coming almost one year ago
""
""
 right
""
""
And he never came and it was a matter of some embarassment 
""
And I think a very large number of people had come to the
conclusion  Mr Boris Yeltsin
 a poor country
""
""
That his main priority right now is to get as much aid and other
systems as he can get  investment if he
can from Japan 
""
And that he is now going to be in the struggle to re-establish
himself with the West  and that he is no longer going to
worry about old geo-political  strategy which made India a national
ally of the Soviet Union 
""
And yes now that he has come  in a sense people are once again
""
 the same love affair can we
atleast hold hand 
""
Uh Mr Vijay Karan how do you see this new affair  developing
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
Well I agree with you there were  there was a state of
uncertainty before he came because  of the announcement that he will come
earlier but he didn't come 
""
At least that uncertainty has been 
removed  degree of
keenness on the part of the Russian to  continue good relations with India
""
Otherwise I doubt them first 
""
The Russians would have been so forth the Russian President for
instance  territorial integrity on
 Pakistan etcetera
""
So I think  Russia
when you think in terms of uh  another regional grouping in
in the long term  off
""
The emerges of any other threat in Islamic law  emerging in the
 or the western powers again there are
some problem
""
So may be  to keep
India on the right side you know good relationship India  a good
relationship with India as as a long term measure 
""
""
It is interesting point 
""
Alright suppose Russia feels some kind of threat from an Islamic
block 
""
""
Well  say an Islamic block
emerges  because of say
Pakistan  or Bangladesh or together they
""
Otherwise I do not see an Islamic block  posing a
serious threat to India
""
But because of Pakistan and Bangladesh  if it poses a threat to
India  than there are there is
we can do something 
""
""
Jagjeet do you think I mean 
ge  the USSR
as a global power  actually Russia is not a global power
 the
potential of trouble in 
""
Uh which is an area  from
India 
""
Do you think this have a serious issue  uh which has agitating
minds in Moscow and does it have anything to do with the new relationship ?
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
 in the sense that yes there is a different sort of perception about
Central Asia 
""
Uh but I don't think 
type of  attempt to build up a new relationship
""
It is perhaps just one more factor in that 
""
Uh the 
""
Russia  global
power just any way  except the United States
""
From from their point of view especially particularly in that
respect so 
""
Uh that way it is not  uh
more in the nature of uhm another great country 
whatever terms you want to use it  not only its own interest
but which needs to co-operate with the larger number of  uh centres of
powers and  uh then just Japan uh North America and
and West Europe  realism I was talking of
""
That there is a return to realism  makes the
whole thing possible to establish a new relationship 
""
Central Asia is certainly an important point 
""
But not that that  I I won't
say 
""
""
Well  I said that because I think the Russian President did
mentioned that  Russia China and India could emerge as
a force together and could work together  what he
mentioned in the press conference
""
""
Well much depend that  certain significant
""
""
""
 know that the number of people who were very
upset in India 
""
 dominated by the USA
""
""
Alas  is no
more 
""
Some of the thing to be getting excited about Russia I think  or
perhaps  be
able to use Russia or some other people 
""
""
Ally with them  searching a broader
""
""
But does it  ?
""
I mean is there any sense in which the uni-polarity of the world
""
""
I mean I don't think the world is really uni-polar  but
clear 
""
""
""
""
""
Right to the extent that the 
doc 
""
""
Do you think  can be used by us in any sense
 ?
""
""
Well first of all uh uh as 
I'm  one of the people who believes that there was never this thing
called a uni-polar  world
""
""
I 
""
""
Except the United States always  always even during the
cold war 
""
And the question was Soviet Union has uh created a capability
mostly military  to countervail that that one
""
So 
""
What he take the military power and the balance of power
unfortunately was being seen in terms of military power
""
Once you take that factor away  then you will start looking at
the 
""
Uh I personally if I think which which  which mean
inclined to look at this issue from the point of view  a
country  against different country
""
I I think  areas on which co-operation
will take place  let us
say between Russia and India  -
Russia and United States or India and the United States 
""
Uh if the  uh
you know prosperity has become  urgent necessity
throughout the world in Russia and India and  and
even in the United States for that matter 
""
And 
""
I think that we need to look at the whole situation  more in
terms of areas on which co-operation will continue 
""
""
Our challenges are really how best to strengthen the areas of
co-operation whether it is United States or with Russia or China or Japan or
whatever 
""
And to ensure that the areas of differences 
 uh sources of
controversial matter  I look
at it
""
""
Yes fine
""
I mean as  there is no
sense in which India  can aligned itself with Russia against the USA
""
I mean Jagjeet has gone out of his way to say  any friendship
 can not be aimed against anybody else
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay lets get to some nuts and bolt  the agreement
signed here and of the specific policy statements  made by Yelstin here
""
""
The obvious one is Kashmir 
""
Earlier there was  considerable uncertainty as to what was going
to be 
""
We had even indicated if 
are  what the Soviet
Union use to do 
""
And yet it would appear  unambiguously
came out 
""
Two questions  ?
""
In other words  one word
 all security council were
driven to 
""
Does it really make much of a difference  that Mr Yelstin has
""
""
Question question number two  uh since this is clearly a message
in trying to get through to us 
""
What is their willingness  which take the climate which we can
capitalize on  ?
""
Mr Vijay Karan
""
""
Yeah  the first question that is about uh
""
""
""
Doesn't matter
""
""
Uhm the fact matter because  you can't uh wish away I mean
the Soviet Union  one mustn't
obtained that after the break up of the Soviet Union  Russia has become
irrelevent
""
As you mentioned 
because as member of the United  that does count
in the world
""
It might be weak economically
""
 own problem
""
""
""
""
""
And uh apart from  the
American question is there on  what they want from Pakistan for instance
""
Pakistan has 
has sent a signal to  a clear signal to Pakistan on terrorism
""
""
If a similar signal can go 
from Russia  Pakistan
""
""
""
""
Yes it is good 
one word 
""
This should be the resolution of the 
""
""
And I think if this had not been resolved  co-operation and
trade co-operation 
""
And this is such a complex affair  that it might be a mistake
to get too deeply into it 
""
But as I understand this extremely complex affair  roughly
twenty percent  value
which should have taken place after  December thirty first nineteen
ninety-one 
""
To that extent there is a kind of rise of thirty percent of the
debt which nobody is talking about 
""
""
""
Of the debt that remains 
reschedule 
""
Where our debt servicing liability comes down  by about two
third 
""
This has been held as an arrangement  that is fair to all and
 bilateral relations now to go ahead on
the trade side
