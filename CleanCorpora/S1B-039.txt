Mr Boris Yeltsin  had an extremely successful
""
""
And such were  reception he got in the
""
people were asking whether he is  than he is
""
""
During his visit he signed ten agreements 
""
And it appeared  between India and
""
""
Now there appeared to be a new beginning with the new Russia 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They are  the director of the
""
""
We have Mr Vijay Karan 
""
""
 of structuring a new relationship between the two
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 there is something we also need to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
key  it's
""
""
""
nature of the previous relationship and the fact that most of the people
still are similar  uh
""
""
In fact this  sort of visit should have taken place much earlier
""
But still I think uh uhm  does
reflect hopes return to realism in Moscow  as well as a certain amount of
""
to build it up  uh with the changed circumstances on the changed
""
""
""
Yes in fact I think  had
""
""
""
""
""
""
And he never came and it was a matter of some embarassment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
That his main priority right now is to get as much aid and other
""
""
""
""
""
worry about old geo-political  strategy which made India a national
ally of the Soviet Union 
""
And yes now that he has come  in a sense people are once again
""
""
atleast hold hand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
keenness on the part of the Russian to  continue good relations with India
""
Otherwise I doubt them first 
""
The Russians would have been so forth the Russian President for
instance  territorial integrity on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
India on the right side you know good relationship India  a good
""
""
""
""
""
Alright suppose Russia feels some kind of threat from an Islamic
""
""
""
""
""
Pakistan  or Bangladesh or together they
""
Otherwise I do not see an Islamic block  posing a
""
""
""
India  than there are there is
we can do something 
""
""
""
ge  the USSR
""
 the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh but I don't think 
""
""
It is perhaps just one more factor in that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
more in the nature of uhm another great country 
""
""
powers and  uh then just Japan uh North America and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a force together and could work together  what he
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
upset in India 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
able to use Russia or some other people 
""
""
Ally with them  searching a broader
""
""
""
""
I mean is there any sense in which the uni-polarity of the world
""
""
I mean I don't think the world is really uni-polar  but
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
doc 
""
""
Do you think  can be used by us in any sense
""
""
""
""
""
called a uni-polar  world
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
mostly military  to countervail that that one
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh I personally if I think which which  which mean
""
""
""
""
""
say between Russia and India  -
""
""
Uh if the  uh
""
throughout the world in Russia and India and  and
""
""
And 
""
I think that we need to look at the whole situation  more in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
controversial matter  I look
""
""
""
""
""
""
sense in which India  can aligned itself with Russia against the USA
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay lets get to some nuts and bolt  the agreement
""
""
""
The obvious one is Kashmir 
""
""
to be 
""
""
""
Union use to do 
""
""
came out 
""
""
""
In other words  one word
""
driven to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
capitalize on  ?
""
Mr Vijay Karan
""
""
Yeah  the first question that is about uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
obtained that after the break up of the Soviet Union  Russia has become
""
""
""
because as member of the United  that does count
""
""
It might be weak economically
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
American question is there on  what they want from Pakistan for instance
""
Pakistan has 
""
""
""
If a similar signal can go 
""
""
""
""
""
""
one word 
""
This should be the resolution of the 
""
""
""
trade co-operation 
""
""
to get too deeply into it 
""
""
twenty percent  value
""
ninety-one 
""
""
debt which nobody is talking about 
""
""
""
""
reschedule 
""
Where our debt servicing liability comes down  by about two
""
""
""
 bilateral relations now to go ahead on
