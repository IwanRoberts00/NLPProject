bottle of scotch

 Laughs 
Then decide one bottle of one or two words 
No we'll buy a good whisky that's no
problem but uh when we'll serve ordinary whisky
Okay 
 Accha what was that uh uh what was
that Mr Mane telling you that this time when they've sports what
do they want your help for 
As a common referee 
As a to 
Ah what do you've to do 
 To 
Look over the things 
What things uh 
What things
 Uh 
To know that everything is going properly or not 
No but for what programme
Or 
For sports
Their inter-school or intership or what 
 You're talking a few words 
National style you see 
Ah okay 
So inter-school sports when are they normally
I don't know 
So he wanted your help 
So funny you know
He he's so much faith in your expertise 
and he he was saying I don't bother you 
You were saying that you need that qualification was N I
L and he was saying we don't bother about all such things 
 Laughs 
 N I L 
So anyway but yesterday we had our inspection my god
so tiring 
We really had a tough time 
Uhm you don't have real qualified teachers 
But you you
That is the biggest problem in your school 
You don't get good 
 Don't talk your teachers are all
bastard teachers 
There is no hope 
You want to have a real good school here 
You don't get good teachers over here 
 There is no professional approach towards
teaching 
But that really we learnt in Bombay 
How to be a professional in your jobs 
 That's it
Shireen she was excellent at that 
She was very good 
She would just you know even even when there was bickering between
teachers and all that 
If ever we went to her with our problems ke 
so and so is you know she used to say just rise above all that 
Because if you just rise above all that just forget about it 
You don't be affected by it and don't even try
to solve it just rise above it
That means you can't have an understand but 
you should keep that others you have to solve that problem of with
management 
You should not neglect your teaching uh you know
No but I believe that we people are not 
 You should be honest with what you're 
teaching 
Not just because I'm I A S I'm appointed as a
teacher I have to go there teach there and teach them for thirty
thirty-five minutes whatever is in the book you know 
Most of your teachers are not well prepared 
 That's true
They should do the preparation at home
I feel its for school teaching you know all the people who
come there half of them are the one who you know haven't been
able to get in anywhere else so they've come into this profession
Look being a once you enter the
class na the teacher doesn't have to open a
book
If she is well prepared she doesn't have to open a book
 Being a 
 No 
She can carry on for one hour also without opening a book
 if she's so thorough 
 They 
 And it is not a question of you being
properly educated and you qualify
If you're honest with it then you can do it
And teaching is a knack
you can be very qualified but you can't communicate 
You can't have a rapport with the children
You just can't communicate what you're 
trying to say 
 That's true 
What is B Ed 
Those teachers are trained to teach 
 They're trained 
That gives you very basic outline you know on how to go about
things 
That basic line you have the 
 But that is also but that is also important
 na how to go about things
If you don't know how to go about things then what you
are going to do 
Uhm that's true
That's the stupid little boon which government has 
imposed on everybody 
And we've a
So all the management should follow the this guidelines 
Your problem is known you can get qualified English teachers 
Our management 
 Trained English teachers
English but not English teacher English
speaking
 But 
English speaking
They all educated through look Marathi medium
 so we can't we don't have to one-word 
 Look 
 You you can get it 
But then 
Look if you want the best then you've to give out the
best also 
They can
You know how to 
Put your hands into your pocket and shell out the money
We just want teachers teachers teachers don't run
like that 
Come on give them proper salaries no 
No what happens you know they know how to speak English
but they don't have the colloquial expressions 
They just you know corrupt they are they talk in very quaint
uh in a very quaint fashion 
They were it's not a sort of and they don't have
vocabulary is so limited that they can't express one thing into two
other ways also 
But then you have to use your expressions facial expressions
to explain things 
 You've to have a good command over the language
If you in in an English medium school 
No that way in a in any language then you should have a
command
Yes
If you want to teach just look 
Besides doing school work if you're fall falling
short on that particular language then you've to work on that
 lang language
Yeah you've to work at it 
But then what happens once you get a get set job they're 
okay
Then they become a bit uh 
Uh you've to do your self-improvement 
How many people really believe in that
And how many are really ready to do that 
How is Ajinkya today
I wonder he got temperature 
Body is slightly warm 
What shall we do now his exams are getting over by the end of
this month
