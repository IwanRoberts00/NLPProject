Okay

""
 uh uh what was
that Mr Mane telling you  sports what
do they want your help for 
""
""
As a common referee 
""
""
As a 
""
Ah what do 
""
""
""
""
""
Look over the things 
""
""
What things 
""
What things
""
""
""
""
""
To know that everything is going properly or not 
""
""
No but for what programme
""
Or 
""
""
For sports
""
""
Their inter-school or 
""
""
""
""
National style you see 
""
""
Ah okay 
""
So inter-school sports when are they normally
""
""
I 
""
""
So he wanted your help 
""
So funny you know
""
He 
and he he was saying I 
""
You were saying that you need that qualification was  N I
L 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So anyway  we had our inspection my god
so tiring 
""
We really had a tough time 
""
""
Uhm you 
""
""
But you you
""
""
That is the biggest problem in your school 
""
""
You 
""
""
 your teachers are all
bastard teachers 
""
There is no hope 
""
You want to have a real good school here 
""
""
You 
""
""
 no professional approach towards
teaching 
""
""
But that really we learnt in Bombay 
""
How to be a professional in your jobs 
""
""
 it
""
""
Shireen 
""
She was very good 
""
She would just you know even even when there was bickering between
teachers and all that 
""
If ever we went to her with our problems 
so and so is you know she used to say just rise above all that 
""
Because if you just rise above all that just forget about it 
""
You  even try
to solve it just rise above it
""
""
That means you 
you should keep that others you have to solve that  problem of with
management 
""
You should not neglect your teaching  uh you know
""
""
No but I believe that we people are 
""
""
""
teaching 
""
Not just because  appointed as a
teacher I have to go there  and teach them for thirty
thirty-five minutes whatever is in the book you know 
""
Most of your teachers are not well prepared 
""
""
 true
""
""
They should do the preparation at home
""
""
I feel its for school teaching you know all the people who
come there half of them are the one who  been
able to get in anywhere else so  come into this profession
""
""
Look  enter the
class  open a
book
""
If she is well prepared she  have to open a book
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She can carry on for one hour also without opening a book
""
""
""
""
""
""
 you being
properly educated and you qualify
""
If  then you can do it
""
""
And teaching is a knack
""
you can be very qualified but you 
""
You  have a rapport with the children
""
You just 
trying to say 
""
""
""
""
What is B Ed 
""
Those teachers are trained to teach 
""
""
""
""
That gives you very basic outline you know on how to go about
things 
""
That basic 
""
""
 but that is also important
 how to go about things
""
If you  know how to go about things then what you
are going to do 
""
""
Uhm  true
""
""
That's the stupid little boon which government has 
imposed on everybody 
""
""
And  a
""
""
So all the management should follow the this guidelines 
""
Your problem is known you can get qualified English teachers 
""
""
Our 
""
""
 English teachers
""
""
English  not English teacher English
speaking
""
""
""
""
""
English speaking
""
""
They all educated through  Marathi medium
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But then 
""
Look if you want the best then  to give out the
best also 
""
""
They can
""
""
You know how to 
""
Put your hands into your pocket and shell out the money
""
We just want teachers teachers teachers  run
like that 
""
Come on give them proper salaries no 
""
""
No what happens you know  they know how to speak English
but they 
""
They just you know  corrupt they are they talk in very quaint
uh in a very quaint fashion 
""
They were  sort of and they don't have
vocabulary is so limited that they can't  express one thing into two
other ways also 
""
""
But then you have to use your expressions facial expressions
to 
""
""
 to have a good command over the language
""
If you in in an English medium school 
""
""
No that way in a  in any language then you should have a
command
""
""
Yes
""
""
If you want to teach just look 
""
Besides doing school work if  falling
short on that particular language  to work on that
 language
""
""
Yeah 
""
But then what happens once you get a get set job 
okay
""
Then they become a bit uh 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
How many people really believe in that
""
And how many are really ready to do that 
""
How is Ajinkya today
""
I wonder he got temperature 
""
""
Body is slightly warm 
""
""
What shall we do now his exams are getting over by the end of
this month 
""
Then he is on holiday 
""
And I have exams
""
So how 
""
One month
""
""
My work is almost getting over
""
""
So when
""
""
By this weekend 
""
""
By this weekend 
""
Then
