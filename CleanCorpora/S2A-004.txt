<I>
Good afternoon 
We have once again a very hot day here but much more still than
it was yesterday 
And let me start once again by welcoming my colleagues Atul
Premnarayan Rakesh Sharma and our expert Sumant Mishra 
Atul are you going to sweat as you did yesterday watching
the match or in the heat ?
Well we did all enjoy the kind of Tennis Ravi that we are going
to watch as all the four players are going to battle out very very
exciting doubles match after one all last evening 
In fact the scoops of ice cream will be most popular and the scoops
of delicious uh soft drinks round
Soft drinks
Let me first uh inform all the viewers who are with us today
That there is some good news as far as India is concerned Leander
Paes is fit and is back on the court
He is going to partner Ramesh Krishnan in the crucial doubles
tie 
And uh with that uh good news with us I think 
it's a good idea if we start with Suman than lets see what he thinks
this match is going to be like 
Well to begin with I noticed Leander Paes has got those
 ankle fringe he is wearing when he went to Australia so
 lets come to the match of one word 
I think it's this is a crucial match although I feel
that they have played as with the same players 
We have a better than fifty fifty chance winning both singles
But they will both be tough matches
So the doubles in any case is very crucial 
This the Koreans have seem they were good reputation 
But they hadn't played I mean Ramesh there makes a bit
different because he he is one of those steady players which create the
opening and Leander has taken to finish them 
In a good doubles team there is always one person who is very
steady keeps getting everything opening the other finishing 
You had the examples of John Macandro and Kan and
Peter Flemming 
Flemming was a mm and so anyway so I think the
players are topping up now at the side 
Rakesh you tell our viewers would like to hear in
Hindi what this doubles is going to be like ?
Well it's always a bit of psychological
advantages uh you had a good victory behind you isn't it ?
But on the other hand Ramesh is an extremely experience
player with a vast number of uh victories of all kind behind him 
I think the most important point that we might like to watch today
is how he combines with Leander Paes 
Uh I rather imagine that Paes is going to take the forehand 
court Suman
Well I just got to mention this the way they standing the
first round they played in Jaipur about five weeks ago 
Ramesh took the right court 
Uh today I think they have decided so let us how this works
out 
I would have preferred Ramesh taking the left court because in
 the steady player always takes the left court
 Ramesh 
Also I think that uh we watched yesterday that this
tendency of Paes to block the backhand return uh can prove to be a bit
of disadvantage in in doubles
Because it gives a lot of time for the opponent to 
re recoup his uh stamina or run quickly or
get back to position quickly 
So I would imagine that uh uh more attacking left hand court
player is more vital aspect in this particular game 
So we will have to see how the strategy works 
Uh Ramesh and Leander Paes uh have played only once before
Rakesh
But they couldn't uh 
Atul uh may be you would like to comment a little bit but
I will ask you a question one possible reason for this uh strategy
of taking the left court by Ramesh Krishnan could be that the Koreans are
putting in a left hander 
And therefore really they will have two right court players
Exactly I was just going to say this Ravi 
In fact an hour before this programme began they were practising on
the outside courts 
And both the Korean stars were practising only serves from the left
court and not from the right court 
Now Ramesh particularly from the left court has a beautiful
backhand which he can tip chipping it very well bringing the 
opponent close to the net
Because the server will be at the base line and he will have to
come up for the server volley tandum 
Just one more thing for the viewers particularly the fact that
Leander Paes is wearinng ankle pads today 
He put them on almost about an hour and half back and he was
warming up with his father on the outside courts 
Trying it for the first time as I asked him 
And Ramanathan Krishnan told me that the minor trouble that he had
in the right ankle would not be a hindrance at all at this stage 
Uhm well that we'll have to see 
The other thing very important is the 
India is represented by Ramesh Krishnan and Leander Paes
 applause 
Korea is represented by Chang Jong and Lee Chong Wo 
applause 
India has won the toss and elected to serve 
Time till the pairs play 
The umpire is coming right 
And one of the uh interesting thing that that happen in
this Davis Cup ties I think that India has won the toss in every match
Haven't we so far ?
So far
Ramesh Krishnan won his toss Leander Paes won his 
and now the doubles team has gone across the court 
So Ramesh and Leander will play from the southern
end near commentators box end and probably Ramesh will serve we
will have to see in a minute 
In the meanwhile once again to the uhm to the Koreans Atul
 uh this is going to be very tough for the Indian because both the
players will play on their forehand 
And that's going to be uh a very much more attacking
combination than uh the normal right handed players
Well I think it will be very difficult for the Indian players
to pass them particularly Ramesh 
And uh the result that I could see yesterday in the two sets
that they played you know really serving very very powerfully 
And both of them with strong shoulders 
Both the Korean stars were reintroduce but they were one word
And Leander now is ready to serve 
The first service of the match crucial match important
match
I hope this can excite us 
And Leander ready to serve 
Love fifteen 
Very good volley there but rather unlucky
Yes 
Bit too long 
He played the shot and Leander he saw the ball all the way to
 saw Chang move 
And he was really good to chase that volley quite easily to an
empty court fifteen O 
Oh 
Fifteen O 
Another service take Chang goes there flack backhand
 down the line no mistakes at all 
Fifteen O 
Very confidently played by Leander
Thirty O 
He was back quick waiting for the volley 
Very good display at the match 
Ankle doesn't seem to be bothering him
Yes 
Seems to be running alright 
Thirty O 
Forty thirty 
The first time in the game Leander has gotten on to a lead 
forty thirty a good service
Serving wide on forehand 
Very easy smash for Ramesh Krishnan forty thirty first
game 
Leander forty 
A very good beginning for India no Suman 
But I like the way uh Leander change over to the forehand
got them on the forehand because one word been consisted in
being serving on the backhand 
But now when he won four and forty more 
The other point I think is important Korean going to do a lot
of interceptions 
You know self systems particularly
So let it will depend on the Indian service return also
how
What do you think of that very brave shot by Chang ?
Oh he's good
I thought that was a good shot
He he he came took the ball on the rise and hit a flak down the
line edge 
He got a good tactic good shot I mean he not the 
these are the player sort of Ramesh is trying to cut off he wanted
to keep it down 
In the beginning you try all those all such things
I don't think he will try
But that try that as this thirty all or so towards the
end of the 
May I we'll have to see whether it can be bad
attacking that bold as the games along but 
Fine 
The position at the moment is that India started serving
the match 
The doubles match first game 
Leander Paes and Krishnan are representing India 
And Chang and Lee are representing Korea in this very vital
doubles match this afternoon at the D L T A court 
India has won the first game
Leander Paes held the service after winning the toss 
And now Chang serves to Paes 
Chang of Korea to serve 
Fifteen love 
Oh that was that was a necessarily pass somewhat in
touch was there have a look there 
A nice return by Krishnan 
Paes could have done anything with that in in the event he
 steady infatuates put it wide outside the baseline 
A bit sure zoom for the rather unnecessary lapse 
They really dropped that return a good return
Chang couldn't do anything there 
So it's thirty fifteen to Korea 
Chang serving to Ramesh 
Forty fifteen
Uh Ravi did you notice this time when Chang was to serve
 Lee the right hander non-playing hand put it behind and held up
a couple of singles which shows that they are going to run across for singles
Yes it's it's a sort of 
You know signal
A signal 
A private signal system 
A very pretty shot by Lee 
In fact that return very beautifully 
Make Tennis look so easy like that doesn't it ?
In fact these are very difficult shots 
So it's one game all
First two games had been held by the server Leander Paes won
his first game 
Chang gave in the same performance 
One O first set in doubles tie 
Fifteen down 
Now there it seems to be some kind of misunderstanding
I thought Lee want to get couldn't get it slipped Chang ran
 almost got it but the net intercept intercepted that 
So Ramesh won the point 
Already tension is showing 
And there goes another gushing out 
Suman this is the fourth time in laughs since
yesterday
As you have mentioned little while line called for might
 wo wo wo uh would you see why Chang
miss that shot 
Why ?
The ball was low near the net
Yes 
And both the Indians had covered up the cross court
Right 
So he thought of going down the line
Going down the line
But but he can't run raise it so near the net 
You can't you can't have these totally inexplicable
errors while you getting too tense uh tense I think 
His serve stop by the net 
He anticipated that 
Rather good drive rather good sense
Have a look there 
Leander intercepts Chang hits another nice shot 
Krishnan stretches and makes it into a win 
Oh another lovely shot by Krishnan there 
A beautiful shot 
Good return and better volley 
An excellent return by Lee and even better volley by
Krishnan
Look at that good flak return by Lee 
And Krishnan stretches out meets a nice big volley 
And he puts it into the net 
Krishnan there serving over game 
Game is over India leads two games to one 
Perfect 
But although India has led has won this game and leading
two games to one 
I think we got to come back to those two point which uh 
Leander Paes seems to have missed up very early in the match
He he hit one volley up which was quite unnecessary and that
 very interesting smash
 It's improvising 
 I'm is it is it already the nerves catching up
with him 
No I think he is trying to prove himself that he he just
trying to overdo it which is sometimes nerves 
It won't be nerves he has played in this tournament 
particularly doubles before 
But here I think he is trying to prove a point and trying
to finish off too soon 
Now both both the shots were inex in 
inexplicable those errors particularly second one when he got so
near the net 
What and the point is that he has to cool down a little
bit because this is going to be a long game probably 
And uh if you stretch on to three or four hours of Tennis
 on a hot day like this you have to keep your cool more than anything
else I think
 Haan definitely I mean he he can't
afford to make those those errors because uh af 
 after a great an open you got a shot like this it is
a gift
Yeah and uh as Ramesh keeps the young lad in check
 comment by Suman and then to Rakesh Sharma 
Well I won't call that's a lead they are just
holding around because holding services 
Quite please quite please 
 Two words Leander Paes 
A very warm and enthusiastic crowd 
Greeting the performance of the two Indian players Ramesh
Krishnan and Leander Paes 
And facing the camera on the far side the Korean number one
star Chang Jong Ta 
Fifteen love 
Ah you notice Atul 
Yes 
That the Korean supporters are in greater numbers today
And with their flags waving there sitting out on the west end 
Very true
West end yeah
