Good afternoon 
""
""
it was yesterday 
""
And let me start once again by  welcoming my colleagues Atul
""
""
Atul  as you did yesterday watching
""
""
""
""
to watch  as all the four players are going to battle out very very
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Let me first uh inform all the viewers who are with us today
""
""
Paes is fit  and is back on the court
""
""
tie 
""
And uh 
""
""
""
""
""
 when he went to Australia so
""
""
I think  although I feel
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
different because  he he is one of those steady players which create the
opening and Leander has taken to finish them 
""
""
steady 
""
You had the examples of John Macandro and  and
Peter Flemming 
""
Flemming was a  I think the
""
""
""
Rakesh  our viewers would like to hear in
""
""
Well  a bit of psychological
""
""
""
player with a vast number of uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
first round they played in Jaipur 
""
""
Uh today I think they have decided so  let us how this works
out 
""
I would have preferred Ramesh taking the left court  because in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I would imagine that uh  uh more attacking left hand court
""
""
So we will have to see how the strategy works 
""
Uh Ramesh and Leander Paes  uh have played only once before
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And both the Korean stars were practising only serves from the left
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
come up for the server volley tandum 
""
Just one more thing for the viewers particularly the fact that
""
""
He put them on almost about an hour and half back and he was
""
""
""
""
""
in the right ankle 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
India is represented by  Ramesh Krishnan and Leander Paes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Time 
""
""
The umpire is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ramesh Krishnan won his toss 
""
""
So  southern
""
will have to see in a minute 
""
""
 both the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And Leander now is ready to serve 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh 
""
""
Fifteen O 
""
""
""
""
""
Fifteen 
""
Very confidently played by Leander
""
""
""
""
""
He was back quick 
""
Very good display at the match 
""
Ankle doesn't seem to be bothering him
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Thirty O 
""
""
""
""
""
The first time in the game Leander has gotten on to a lead 
""
""
Serving wide on forehand 
""
Very easy  forty thirty first
""
""
""
""
""
""
A very good beginning for India no Suman 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of interceptions 
""
""
""
""
how
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
line edge 
""
""
""
""
to keep it down 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But that try that as this thirty all or  so towards the
""
""
""
""
attacking that bold as the games along but 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The doubles match 
""
Leander Paes and Krishnan 
""
""
doubles match this afternoon 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Chang of Korea to serve 
""
Fifteen love 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Paes could have done anything with that in  in the event he
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Forty fifteen
""
""
Uh Ravi did you notice this time  when Chang was to serve
""
a couple of singles which shows that they are going to run across for singles
""
""
""
""
""
You know signal
""
""
A signal 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Make Tennis look so easy like that doesn't it ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
his first game 
""
Chang 
""
One O first set 
""
Fifteen down 
""
Now there it seems to be some kind of misunderstanding
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Suman this is the fourth time  since
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And  cross court
""
""
Right 
""
""
So he thought of going down the line
""
""
Going down the line
""
""
""
""
""
You can't you can't have these  totally inexplicable
""
""
""
""
He anticipated that 
""
""
Rather good drive  rather good sense
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh another lovely shot by Krishnan there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
An excellent return by Lee  and even better volley by
""
""
Look at that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Game is over 
""
""
""
""
""
""
two games to one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 is it is it already the nerves catching up
with him 
""
""
No I think he is trying to prove himself that he  he just
""
""
It won't be nerves he has played in this tournament 
""
""
But here I think he is trying to  trying
to finish off too soon 
""
""
""
""
""
""
What  and the point is that he has to cool down a little
""
""
And uh  three or four hours of Tennis
""
""
""
""
""
afford to make those those errors 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
holding around because holding services 
""
""
Quite please
