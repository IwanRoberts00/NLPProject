Good afternoon 
""
We have once again a very hot day here but  much more still than
it was yesterday 
""
And let me start once again by  welcoming my colleagues Atul
Premnarayan 
""
Atul  as you did yesterday watching
the match or in the heat ?
""
""
Well we did all enjoy the kind of Tennis Ravi that we are going
to watch  as all the four players are going to battle out very very
exciting doubles match after one all last evening 
""
In fact the scoops of ice cream will be most popular and the scoops
of  delicious uh soft drinks round
""
""
Soft drinks
""
""
Let me first uh inform all the viewers who are with us today
""
That there is some good news as far as India is concerned Leander
Paes is fit  and is back on the court
""
He is going to partner Ramesh Krishnan  in the crucial doubles
tie 
""
And uh 
it's  lets see what he thinks
this match is going to be like 
""
""
Well to  begin with I noticed Leander Paes has got those
 when he went to Australia so
""
""
I think  although I feel
that they have played as with the same players 
""
We have a better than  fifty fifty chance winning both singles
""
""
But  they will both be tough matches
""
So the doubles in any case is very crucial 
""
This 
""
But  they hadn't played I mean Ramesh there makes a bit
different because  he he is one of those steady players which create the
opening and Leander has taken to finish them 
""
In a good doubles team  there is always one person who is very
steady 
""
You had the examples of John Macandro and  and
Peter Flemming 
""
Flemming was a  I think the
players are topping up 
""
""
Rakesh  our viewers would like to hear in
Hindi  ?
""
Well  a bit of psychological
advantages uh  ?
""
But on the other hand  an extremely experience
player with a vast number of uh 
""
I think the most important point that we might like to watch today
is how he combines with Leander Paes 
""
Uh 
court Suman
""
""
Well I just got to mention this the way they standing  the
first round they played in Jaipur 
Ramesh took the right court 
""
Uh today I think they have decided so  let us how this works
out 
""
I would have preferred Ramesh taking the left court  because in
 the steady player always takes the left court
""
""
""
""
""
Also I think that uh  watched yesterday that this
tendency of Paes to block the backhand return  uh can prove to be a bit
of disadvantage in in doubles
""
Because it gives 
re  stamina or run quickly or
get back to position quickly 
""
So I would imagine that uh  uh more attacking left hand court
player is more vital aspect 
""
So we will have to see how the strategy works 
""
Uh Ramesh and Leander Paes  uh have played only once before
Rakesh
""
""
But they couldn't uh 
""
""
Atul uh  may be you would like to comment a little bit but
I will ask you a question  strategy
of taking the left court by Ramesh Krishnan could be that the  Koreans are
putting in a left hander 
""
And therefore really they will have two right  court players
""
""
""
Exactly I was just going to say this Ravi 
""
In fact an hour before this programme began they were practising on
the outside courts 
""
And both the Korean stars were practising only serves from the left
court 
""
Now Ramesh particularly from the left court has a beautiful
backhand which he can 
opponent close to the net
""
Because the server will be at the base line  and he will have to
come up for the server volley tandum 
""
Just one more thing for the viewers particularly the fact that
Leander Paes is wearinng 
""
He put them on almost about an hour and half back and he was
warming up with his father on the outside courts 
""
Trying it for the first time as I asked him 
""
And Ramanathan Krishnan told me that the minor trouble that he had
in the right ankle 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
The other thing very important is the 
""
""
India is represented by  Ramesh Krishnan and Leander Paes
""
""
Korea is represented by 
applause 
""
India has won the toss 
""
Time 
""
""
The umpire is 
""
And one of the  that happen in
this Davis Cup ties I think that  India has won the toss in every match
""
Haven't we so far  ?
""
""
So far
""
""
Ramesh Krishnan won his toss 
and now the doubles team has gone across the court 
""
So  southern
end  and probably Ramesh will serve we
will have to see in a minute 
""
In the meanwhile  to the Koreans Atul
 both the
players will play on their forehand 
""
And  going to be uh a very much more attacking
combination than uh  the normal right handed players
""
""
Well I think it will be very difficult for the Indian players
to pass them particularly Ramesh 
""
And uh the result that I could see yesterday in the  two sets
that they played you know really serving very very powerfully 
""
And both of them with strong shoulders 
""
Both the Korean stars were reintroduce but they were  one word
""
""
""
And Leander now is ready to serve 
""
The first service of the match  important
match
""
I hope this can excite us 
""
And Leander 
""
""
Love fifteen 
""
""
Very good volley there but  rather unlucky
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Bit too long 
""
He played the shot and Leander he saw the ball  all the way to
""
""
And he was really good to chase that volley quite easily  to an
empty court 
""
""
Oh 
""
""
Fifteen O 
""
""
Another service  Chang goes there flack backhand
""
""
Fifteen 
""
Very confidently played by Leander
""
""
Thirty O 
""
""
He was back quick 
""
Very good display at the match 
""
Ankle doesn't seem to be bothering him
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Seems to be running alright 
""
Thirty O 
""
""
Forty thirty 
""
""
The first time in the game Leander has gotten on to a lead 
forty thirty a good service
""
Serving wide on forehand 
""
Very easy  forty thirty first
game 
""
""
Leander 
""
""
A very good beginning for India no Suman 
""
""
But I like the way uh  Leander change over to the forehand
got them on the forehand  been consisted in
being serving on the backhand 
""
But now when he won four and forty more 
""
The other point I think is  important Korean going to do a lot
of interceptions 
""
You know self systems particularly
""
So  Indian service return also
how
""
""
What do you think of that very brave shot by Chang  ?
""
""
Oh  good
""
""
I thought that was a good shot
""
He he he came took the ball on the rise and hit a flak down the
line edge 
""
""
He got a good tactic 
these are the player  Ramesh is trying to cut off he wanted
to keep it down 
""
In the beginning you try all those  all such things
""
""
I don't think he will try
""
""
But that try that as this thirty all or  so towards the
end of the 
""
""
May I  bad
attacking that bold as the games along but 
""
""
Fine 
""
""
The position at the moment is that India  started serving
the match 
""
The doubles match 
""
Leander Paes and Krishnan 
""
And Chang and Lee  are representing Korea in this very vital
doubles match this afternoon 
""
India has won the first game
""
Leander Paes held the service 
""
And now Chang 
""
""
Chang of Korea to serve 
""
Fifteen love 
""
""
Oh that was  somewhat in
touch was there 
""
A nice return by Krishnan 
""
Paes could have done anything with that in  in the event he
""
""
A bit sure zoom for the 
""
They really dropped that return  a good return
""
Chang couldn't do anything there 
""
So 
""
Chang serving to Ramesh 
""
""
Forty fifteen
""
""
Uh Ravi did you notice this time  when Chang was to serve
 and held up
a couple of singles which shows that they are going to run across for singles
""
""
Yes 
""
""
You know signal
""
""
A signal 
""
A private signal system 
""
A very pretty shot by Lee 
""
In fact that return very beautifully 
""
Make Tennis look so easy like that doesn't it ?
""
In fact these are very difficult shots 
""
So  one game all
""
First two games had been held by the server  Leander Paes won
his first game 
""
Chang 
""
One O first set 
""
Fifteen down 
""
Now there it seems to be some kind of misunderstanding
""
I thought Lee want to get couldn't get it  slipped Chang ran
""
""
So 
""
Already 
""
And there goes another gushing out 
""
Suman this is the fourth time  since
yesterday
""
""
As you have mentioned little while line called for  might
 you see why Chang
miss that shot 
""
""
Why ?
""
""
The ball was low near the net
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And  cross court
""
""
Right 
""
""
So he thought of going down the line
""
""
Going down the line
""
""
But 
""
""
You can't you can't have these  totally inexplicable
errors while 
""
His serve stop by the net 
""
He anticipated that 
""
""
Rather good drive  rather good sense
""
Have a look there 
""
""
Leander intercepts 
""
Krishnan stretches and makes it into a win 
""
Oh another lovely shot by Krishnan there 
""
A beautiful shot 
""
""
Good return and better volley 
""
""
An excellent return by Lee  and even better volley by
Krishnan
""
Look at that 
""
And 
""
And he puts it into the net 
""
Krishnan there 
""
""
Game is over 
""
""
Perfect 
""
""
But although India has led  has won this game and leading
two games to one 
""
I think we got to come back to those 
Leander Paes  match
""
He  he hit one volley up which was quite unnecessary and that
 very interesting smash
""
""
""
""
""
 is it is it already the nerves catching up
with him 
""
""
No I think he is trying to prove himself that he  he just
trying to overdo it which is 
""
It won't be nerves he has played in this tournament 
particularly doubles before 
""
But here I think he is trying to  trying
to finish off too soon 
""
Now both both the shots were 
inexplicable  those errors particularly second one when he got so
near the net 
""
""
What  and the point is that he has to cool down a little
bit because this is going to be a long game probably 
""
And uh  three or four hours of Tennis
 more than anything
else I think
""
""
 he can't
afford to make those those errors 
 it is
a gift
""
""
Yeah  as Ramesh keeps the young lad in check
""
""
""
Well I won't call  a lead they are just
holding around because holding services 
""
""
Quite please 
""
""
""
""
A very warm and enthusiastic crowd 
""
Greeting the  Ramesh
Krishnan and Leander Paes 
""
And facing the camera on the far side  the Korean number one
star 
""
""
Fifteen love 
""
""
Ah you notice Atul 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
That the  Korean supporters are in greater numbers today
""
""
And with their flags waving there sitting out on the west end 
""
""
Very true
""
""
West end yeah
