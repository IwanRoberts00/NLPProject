What literature do you teach  ?
""
""
Uh  uh it starts
from the  to
the 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Uh  the
second year and the third year
""
""
Uhm  so your basic specialisation is actually literature
""
""
Literature yeah 
""
""
French literature
""
""
Yeah French literature  I did literature for
the M A  for my M Phil actually I changed I changed my
topic a little
""
I I did  then I
have  gone back to literature
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm Uhm 
""
Uh what authors do you normally read  ?
""
Are you working on some particular author or ?
""
""
Oh not at the moment 
""
I am not working on my Ph D at the moment though I have hoped to
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
But uh 
""
""
Who are the authors you are reading  ?
""
""
Well uh uh  ?
""
""
Teaching also
""
""
Teaching well we start from the 
""
So we start with Harbeley and  we go
on to  uhm
uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh  the realist Flau Bert
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Madame Bowary  well known
author
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  uh alright coming to your evening courses in the
certificate of proficiency course  uh what is the text book you are
following  ?
""
""
Uh we have this book called uh 
Alize
""
""
s de francais
""
""
""
Yeah  a a
very recent uh 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
but uh  it is a good book
""
""
""
""
""
Good book
""
""
Good book yeah 
""
""
Is it one  entire certificate
""
""
""
""
""
 yeah entire certificate
is one book 
""
I mean we have three 
""
The 
""
So those we use for the certificate uh the diploma and the advanced
""
""
""
""
""
""
 diploma
""
""
So we don't always uh  finish the entire book itself
""
 a little too much
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So we say about the  three fourth of the the book we do
with the C O P  then we continue with the diploma
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Three fourth of the second book and then we continue with the
third book uh  for the advanced
diploma
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Of course we supplement it with 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
What is the book uh you follow for  uh Russian ?
""
""
Uh you see we have several text books available but  uh I
normally use uh  Russki yuzik dlya vsekh
 Russian for everybody
""
""
""
""
 it has one text
book
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And there is one latest stock 
jokes 
""
Then a book of exercises 
""
These excercises they normally do at home
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Then we also have a book called 
Reader 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uh niya
 there are some stories etcetera
there
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
They read it like  non-detailed text
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Plus there is a  which gives all the
words which are used in the text book and all these books 
""
Plus there is one small reference grammar 
""
Now this grammar  you
know lesson-wise again
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So 
""
""
Yeah actually our courses has a casette which goes with it
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
It it has  guide for
the teacher
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh it has a book of exercises  like as
you said we do these excercises we give them these exercises to do at home
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh  the
lessons in those  uh in the books are recorded on the casettes plus there
are some oral exercises on the casette which we do in class uh
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Then which is not always very convenient because when we have
a very big class of about hundred students to get them to hear the whole
casette is  so
""
""
Our set also goes with a casette but it is optional
""
Sometimes casettes are available  sometimes they are not
available 
""
But when they are available they are very useful
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So that way  if there is a casette then you don't even
need a teacher
""
You can really learn the whole thing from the text book  from
the  whole set
""
You see it is a set which is very useful it is good 
""
I like that very much  but in fact I started this thing only to
ask you about this 
""
The problem we face is  there are good text books like this uh
 but they are simply not
available  and
all 
""
""
 uh our books are not
available either because uh  they
cost about three hundred fifty to four hundred  each
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Which is uh 
""
""
Very high
""
""
Too high  can't expect students to buy
them at all
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So what we do is we get them xeroxed 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Means we don't get the book of exercises xeroxed  those we
pick out exercise which  can be done by the students
""
We get them uh  just
a few of them
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh  the others we do in class
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But the book as such we get it xeroxed 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh that it works out much cheaper than  buying the
book
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Means cost about eighty 
 them xeroxed
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
I think okay  only thing you miss out of the colours and
uh  in the book
 you know
without uh  with the xeroxed copy
""
""
Uhm  always this is the greatest problem we are facing
""
We just can't buy books they are simply not available 
""
Library of course has several copies  but then these are all
part time students  so we cannot give the books to them
from the library 
it's  a terrible problem
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah they can sit and 
""
""
Right they can sit but at home you 
require  a text book when you are learning
""
So 
""
""
 uh have you
been xeroxing them or uh 
""
""
With some great difficulty last year we could get uh  a
couple of books for some students 
""
So they were even sharing books like uh  one book for two
students 
""
I don't know what will happen next year  next year
""
""
Can't you get xeroxed copies  I mean uh
""
""
Now xeroxing the whole set or whatever  you know there are
lots of pictures 
""
And you cannot avoid it because uh  are
going with the text 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
So every thing is  uh text is there photographs are there
 all these things are there
""
""
And if you want to take photocopies of the whole thing it become
very expensive 
""
""
Or may be you could  uh may be get out some copies from
the library and keep them with you and give them to the students in class 
""
Not let them take them home 
""
""
But if they don't  if they don't
return means it will
""
""
""
""
""
Ha no  you don't allow them to take it home
""
You allow them to read them in class
""
""
But at home
""
""
Atleast in class they will have a book 
""
""
But they 
yeah 
""
You have to kind of  after going home you have to revise your
lessons  you must read what has been taught in the class
""
""
""
""
""
Yes exactly 
""
""
So you have to have the text books
""
So 
""
I don't know what will be done in future maybe  they'll
""
""
""
 uh some other
book which  readily available
""
""
""
""
""
The reason uh  problem now is that in fact no book is
available  even those which are
popular
""
""
Not even Wagner is it 
""
""
""
and which is not available now 
""
""
I thought Wagner was available in uh  in uh
""
""
Yeah right now in advanced diploma I am using Wagner  and
even that is not available now 
""
""
Oh so 
""
""
Still I couldn't.
""
We are producing a possibility of it. 
""
Nobody has got 
""
""
So you are still continuing with Wagner you haven't thought
""
""
""
No Wagner I use for the advanced diploma course  third
year course  Russian for
everybody 
 and then uh I have
switched over to Wagner now  in higher
diploma
""
""
But that  to Wagner or
is it just one book  ?
""
""
One book 
""
""
 just one book
""
""
Wagner is a one book  sixty-two
lessons
""
""
""
""
""
I did my C O P to advanced diploma with Wagner 
yeah  Russian
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But for the C O P we found it was uh 
authentic 
""
""
Uhm  it is like an encyclopaedia
""
""
""
it's  like a dictionary
""
""
How exactly
""
""
With a list of words which are very difficult to learn by
heart and specially long Russian words which are impossible to remember
""
""
""
like  when
we were planning this  I
thought I will discuss this with you because you know you teach French and I
teach Russian 
""
I also read some French 
""
I did two years of French here  Shastri
taught me 
""
Anyway 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
See one observation I made always was  while doing this
French 
""
You know my observations are based on uh  not only just my
first hand experience  various
Universities  uh
Poona University 
syllabus 
""
What I  that in the French courses
 uh a little more uh emphasis on
the 
somehow gets slightly diluted  uh taught in such a
nice fashion as the oral skills are taught 
""
In the Russian 
""
""
Yeah  on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
given  doing
them like mathematics 
they write well  but when it
comes to free conversation like this oral conversation you know just speaking
like this in 
""
They can't do it  Russian students somehow just can't speak
Russian  uh commit
quite a number of mistakes you know  but when
they speak they are so fluent you know  very fluently speak
 even when nobody is watching even when there is
absolutely no need for it  uh they
love to speak French
