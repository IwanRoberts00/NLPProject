""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah French literature  I did literature for
""
topic a little
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm Uhm 
""
""
""
Are you working on some particular author or ?
""
""
Oh not at the moment 
""
I am not working on my Ph D at the moment though I have hoped to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well uh uh  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  the realist Flau Bert
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
following  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
very recent uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
but uh  it is a good book
""
""
""
""
""
Good book
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we don't always uh  finish the entire book itself
""
 a little too much
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
third book uh  for the advanced
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
book
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And there is one latest stock 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Then we also have a book called 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 there are some stories etcetera
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this grammar  you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
It it has  guide for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  the
lessons in those  uh in the books are recorded on the casettes plus there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
casette is  so
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But when they are available they are very useful
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So that way  if there is a casette then you don't even
need a teacher
""
""
the  whole set
""
You see it is a set which is very useful it is good 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh our books are not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Very high
""
""
""
them at all
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So what we do is we get them xeroxed 
""
""
""
""
""
Means we don't get the book of exercises xeroxed  those we
""
""
""
a few of them
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh  the others we do in class
""
""
""
""
""
But the book as such we get it xeroxed 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh that it works out much cheaper than  buying the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think okay  only thing you miss out of the colours and
""
 you know
""
""
""
Uhm  always this is the greatest problem we are facing
""
""
""
""
""
from the library 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right they can sit but at home you 
""
""
So 
""
""
 uh have you
been xeroxing them or uh 
""
""
With some great difficulty last year we could get uh  a
""
""
So they were even sharing books like uh  one book for two
""
""
I don't know what will happen next year  next year
""
""
Can't you get xeroxed copies  I mean uh
""
""
""
""
""
And you cannot avoid it because uh  are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 all these things are there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if they don't  if they don't
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ha no  you don't allow them to take it home
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
I don't know what will be done in future maybe  they'll
""
""
""
 uh some other
""
""
""
""
""
""
The reason uh  problem now is that in fact no book is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
even that is not available now 
""
""
Oh so 
""
""
Still I couldn't.
""
""
""
Nobody has got 
""
""
So you are still continuing with Wagner you haven't thought
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
One book 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
yeah  Russian
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
authentic 
""
""
Uhm  it is like an encyclopaedia
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
like  when
""
""
teach Russian 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
See one observation I made always was  while doing this
""
""
You know my observations are based on uh  not only just my
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh a little more uh emphasis on
""
somehow gets slightly diluted  uh taught in such a
""
""
In the Russian 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
they write well  but when it
comes to free conversation like this oral conversation you know just speaking
like this in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
