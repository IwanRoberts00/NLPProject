<I>
Uh uh well Anjali you have been uh teaching French here
 uh what courses are you taking right now ?
Uh I am taking uh C O P course uhm 
that's in the morning and I'm also taking the advanced diploma
courses in the evening
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm what about M A do you teach M A also ?
Yeah I teach uh literature at uh the M A level
Literature you teach
Yeah 
What literature do you teach ?
Uh well mainly classical literature and uh it starts
from the sixteen century to the the middle ages uhm to
the nine ninteenth century 
 Uhm 
Uhm
Uh I mean we do that over a span of two years the
second year and the third year
Uhm so your basic specialisation is actually literature
Literature yeah 
French literature
Yeah French literature that is I did literature for
the M A but uh I for my M Phil actually I changed I changed my
topic a little
I I did uh teaching of French uhm uhm then I
have come back to I've gone back to literature
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm Uhm 
Uh what authors do you normally read ?
Are you working on some particular author or ?
Oh not at the moment 
I am not working on my Ph D at the moment though I have hoped to
 uhm very soon 
 Uhm 
Uhm
But uh 
Who are the authors you are reading ?
Well uh uh ma reading or uh teaching ?
Teaching also
Teaching well we start from the middle ages 
So we start with Harbeley and uh uhm we go
on to uh the eighteenth century Voltaire Rousseau uhm
uhm uhm then ninteenth century we have all the Romantic poets 
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm 
And uh the realist Flau Bert
Uhm uhm 
Madame Bowary oh this this uh well known
author
 Oh 
Uhm uh alright coming to your evening courses in the
certificate of proficiency course uh what is the text book you are
following ?
Uh we have this book called uh 
Alizee-acutes de francais 
 Alizee-acutes de francais
 
Yeah it's a it's a it's a a
very recent uh book 
Uhm uhm they stated all the new methods 
 Taken in all the new methods and did well 
but uh uhm it is a good book
 Uhm 
Good book
Good book yeah 
Is it one book for the entire certificate
 No it's the three 
 It's no it's uh yeah entire certificate
is one book 
I mean we have three uh three volumes 
The first one second one third one 
So those we use for the certificate uh the diploma and the advanced
 diploma 
 Oh you have 
 Advanced diploma
So we don't always uh finish the entire book itself
 It's a little too much
Uhm
So we say about the three fourth of the the book we do
with the C O P uhm then we continue with the diploma
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Three fourth of the second book and then we continue with the
third book uh the second and the third book uh for the advanced
diploma
Uhm
Of course we supplement it with our own materials 
Uhm uhm 
What is the book uh you follow for uh Russian ?
Uh you see we have several text books available but uh I
normally use uh a book called Russki yuzik dlya vsekh
 that means you know Russian for everybody
 
 It's called Russian for everybody 
 It's a whole set of books actually it has one text
book
Uhm 
And there is one latest stock so a lot of conversation 
jokes anecdotes they are all there 
Then a book of exercises 
These excercises they normally do at home
Uhm 
Then we also have a book called you know 
Reader 
Uhm 
Uh KNiga dlya chtee- acuteniya
 this is a book there are some stories etcetera
there
Uhm 
They read it like non-detailed text
Yeah 
Plus there is a small dictionary which gives all the
words which are used in the text book and all these books 
Plus there is one small reference grammar 
Now this grammar uh explains all the grammar used in you
know lesson-wise again
Yeah 
So that way it's a nice compact one 
Yeah actually our courses has a casette which goes with it
Uhm 
It it has uh uh book meant for the teacher guide for
the teacher
Uhm 
And uh it has a book of exercises uhm like as
you said we do these excercises we give them these exercises to do at home
 Uhm 
Uhm 
And uh there is a casette which goes with all the
lessons in those uh in the books are recorded on the casettes plus there
are some oral exercises on the casette which we do in class uh
Uhm uhm 
Then which is not always very convenient because when we have
a very big class of about hundred students to get them to hear the whole
casette is uh it's quite difficult so
Our set also goes with a casette but it is optional
Sometimes casettes are available sometimes they are not
available 
But when they are available they are very useful
Yeah 
So that way if there is a casette then you don't even
need a teacher
You can really learn the whole thing from the text book from
the whole set
You see it is a set which is very useful it is good 
I like that very much but in fact I started this thing only to
ask you about this 
The problem we face is there are good text books like this uh
 Russian for Everybody but they are simply not
available now because of the Soviet Union one word and
all 
 Yeah nor did our books uh our books are not
available either because uh I mean they are available but uh they
cost about three hundred fifty to four hundred rupees each
Uhm 
Which is uh 
Very high
Too high students can't expect students to buy
them at all
Uhm 
So what we do is we get them xeroxed 
Uhm uhm
Means we don't get the book of exercises xeroxed those we
pick out exercise which can be done by the students
We get them uh typed photo copies uhm uhm just
a few of them
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm 
And uh the others we do in class
Uhm 
But the book as such we get it xeroxed the main book 
Uhm uhm 
And uh that it works out much cheaper than buying the
book
Uhm uhm 
Means cost about eighty rupees to get 
 the them xeroxed
Uhm 
I think okay only thing you miss out of the colours and
uh means there is a lot of play on colours etc., in the in the book
 pictures full of pictures you lose out on all that you know
without uh with the xeroxed copy
Uhm always this is the greatest problem we are facing
We just can't buy books they are simply not available 
Library of course has several copies but then these are all
part time students yeah so we cannot give the books to them
from the library if they take and if they don't return 
it's a terrible problem
 Yeah 
 In fact they are not even among uh 
Yeah they can sit and read it 
Right they can sit but at home you required 
require a text book when you are learning
So text book has a 
 So what have you been doing uh have you
been xeroxing them or uh 
With some great difficulty last year we could get uh a
couple of books for some students 
So they were even sharing books like uh one book for two
students whatever was available 
I don't know what will happen next year next year
Can't you get xeroxed copies I mean uh
Now xeroxing the whole set or whatever you know there are
lots of pictures photos etcetera 
And you cannot avoid it because uh you know photos are are
going with the text 
Yeah
So every thing is uh text is there photographs are there
 pictures are there diagrams are there all these things are there
And if you want to take photocopies of the whole thing it become
very expensive extremely expensive 
Or may be you could uh may be get out some copies from
the library and keep them with you and give them to the students in class 
Not let them take them home 
But if they don't return if they don't
return means it will
 But uh 
Ha no you don't allow them to take it home
You allow them to read them in class
But at home
Atleast in class they will have a book 
But they badly require a text book at home 
yeah how will you do the exercise how will you study 
You have to kind of after going home you have to revise your
lessons you must read what has been taught in the class
 Yeah 
Yes exactly 
So you have to have the text books
So it's a great problem we are now facing 
I don't know what will be done in future maybe they'll
 
 But couldn't you have chosen uh some other
book which is uh or readily available
 Now the other 
The reason uh problem now is that in fact no book is
available not a single book is available even those which are
popular
Not even Wagner is it 
 Wa even Wagner which is published in Delhi 
and which is not available now 
I thought Wagner was available in uh in uh
Yeah right now in advanced diploma I am using Wagner and
even that is not available now 
Oh so you've you've still uh 
Still I couldn't.
We are producing a possibility of it. 
Nobody has got 
So you are still continuing with Wagner you haven't thought
No Wagner I use for the advanced diploma course third
year course first year second year I follow this Russian for
everybody that's what I did do 
 with my students now same batch which I now and then uh I have
switched over to Wagner now now they are doing on Wagner in higher
diploma
But that is it the other two uh volumes to Wagner or
is it just one book ?
One book 
 It's just one book
Wagner is a one book of the huge sixty-two
lessons
 It's huge 
I did my C O P to advanced diploma with Wagner 
yeah Russian
 Yeah 
Uhm 
But for the C O P we found it was uh too too 
authentic 
Uhm it is it is like an encyclopaedia
 It's like an encyclopaedia it's uh 
it's like a dictionary
How exactly
With a list of words which are very difficult to learn by
heart and specially long Russian words which are impossible to remember
 It's full of words words words words it's 
like one word in Telugu and then actually when
we were planning this there was one problem I was thinking about I
thought I will discuss this with you because you know you teach French and I
teach Russian 
I also read some French 
I did two years of French here uh Tutkar taught me Shastri
taught me sometime Nelu also taught me for sometime 
Anyway and you read some Russian 
Yeah 
See one observation I made always was while doing this
French and while teaching Russian 
You know my observations are based on uh not only just my
first hand experience but also looking at the syllabi various
Universities I know the syllabi of uh Nagpur University uh
Poona University I've seen uh even J N U's 
syllabus our own syllabus of Osmania University I know very well 
What I somehow you know see is that in the French courses
 there is some what uh of you know uh a little more uh emphasis on
the oral skills speaking skills where as the written part 
somehow gets slightly diluted it's not uh taught in such a
nice fashion as the oral skills are taught 
In the Russian it is the other way round 
Yeah there is emphasis on the wri on
 the written uh yes 
 In Russian 
 On the written skill 
Yeah in the Russian classes uh you see we 
given give them so many exercises they go on doing
them like mathematics so they are very good at reading and writing 
they write well they answer questions they do exercises but when it
comes to free conversation like this oral conversation you know just speaking
like this in uh among people they are so shy of doing it 
They can't do it Russian students somehow just can't speak
Russian whereas French students I feel when they write they uh commit
quite a number of mistakes you know lots of mistakes but when
they speak they are so fluent you know they just very fluently speak
 even among themselves even when nobody is watching even when there is
absolutely no need for it I feel French students you know uh they
love to speak French
