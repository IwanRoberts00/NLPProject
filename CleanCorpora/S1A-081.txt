I am uh Professor Prem Singh of the Department of the
Linguistics University of Delhi 
I am Ravindra Gargesh also of the Department of Linguistics
University of Delhi 
Uh well since uh we were talking about the
problems uh that we face in analysis of literary text 
Uh you see besides you know the text in stylistic analysis
 uh what other things you are paying attention to ?
You see I am also engaged along with that the whole problem of 
uh uh translation and uh and in that you see I have told you that 
I've been dealing with this problem that all translations are at
the le level of parole not at the level of langue 
Now how does this fitting include your theory of stylistics and
understanding of a text ?
Ah that's very interesting you see uh first
of all what comprises textual analysis because coming from the 
dis discipline of linguistics we have to be micro approach to begin
with the micro approach 
Now in the micro approach we have to see what the text is
constituted of
Uhm uhm 
That is the text is a larger uhm uhm symbol
 Uhm uhm 
But what is that symbol made of
Uhm uhm 
And when we break it into its uh constituent parts 
 uhm uhm then we have to look at it in terms of its language
structures
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm 
Language structures in the sense of in linguistic terms
 as well as in let us say metalinguistic terms 
Uhm uhm 
In the linguistics terms what are the patterns what are the
 uh how the uh particular sensitivities are issues are coded or
certain concepts are coded 
And then how that codification does not remain only the prime
way does not contain only primary limits but it is to have secondary
limits within a larger context 
Uhm uhm
So we have to look at uh the language at two levels 
First level is the level of linguistic structures 
Uhm uhm 
And in second level will be level of lexical significations
Significations within textual context 
So what your significance is not really significant in the
sense of uh the contemporary or French school in the sense that a
particularly there is an a company where they are
trying to deconstruct the text 
You don't seem to be deconstructing the text in any significant
way where either the the entire structuation of signification uh
 falls apart in a way but at the same time it gives you the peep 
a peep into human minds
It also believes a kind of psychological and philosophical and
historical forces involved in understanding of a text 
Very right very right 
Uh we are I mean the kind of analysis that I am doing these
are variants between French school different way 
But that was primarily because I think the text as way odd
identity 
And uh perhaps I would not like to begin analysis wherever I
want 
So that is one defect because for the in the deconstruction
 one can bring in anything 
You can bring in your subjectivity to interpret the text 
Whereas if text is structured if human mind is structured
 or if language is structured then definitely the text must also uh
 get restructured 
And if the text has a structure we have to go from some recent
structure towards the end or towards significations 
Basically what you are trying to establish is a kind of a 
grammar of of stylistics and grammar of analysis 
And you know if I quote uh that these all grammars leak
So what are the leakages in your laughter 
Yes the grammar is weak and there are major weaks in this
grammar so that 
 Even even you see though in all linguistic
analysis we know that in Panini grammar which is called the perfect
grammar is is really an imperfect grammar otherwise yeah
 Katyayana would not need to write uh would not have needed to write
separately and then openly didn't need to get up and defend Panini
against Katyayana
And sometimes uh you know one word makes a uh fun of
himself
 Yeah 
Oh alright 
 Two words fool of himself when defending Panini
Ahn
Uh so one word worried about is what are the
leaks in your grammar of style and your grammar of literary analysis ?
Well there are many leaks
Ahn 
 It's leaving of it's leaving everywhere
Because firstly there is no comprehensive that the grammar of uh
 literary analysis that one word you can put it like that 
There is no comprehensive 
For example for poetry for poetic analysis we require a
separate set of parametres for analysis 
For drama which may be a non-poetic text particularly 
we'll require separate uh uhm parametre for analysis 
And for stories or narratives we would require still separate
parametres of analysis 
So you see there are multiple levels of analysis
I I and could say to catch that I say one
is the phonological one is the morphological level third is a
syntactic level in that way you can't you want to say that at this
parametre of poetry in these parts fiction then these for drama 
I say alright poetry is a kind of one word level 
phonology and uh a drama at the level of uh morphology and and
text analysis of a a fiction is at the level of syntax
How would you defend uh your position against mine this this
 your view 
 And 
 Yes that would be uh my position will be at
variance somewhat 
Uh for poetic analysis I would agree with you that uh 
phonological patterns are significant morphological pattern are
significant syntactic patterns are significant semantic
configurations will be in the sense of figurative language are
significant 
And how these interact and lead down to larger meaning larger
meaning constructs 
But in drama things are going to be different because by
and large we may have sentences which are incomplete 
So there the unit of analysis cannot be a line because poetry would
be line laced or stanzas 
But in drama we'll have to be very different 
 We'll have to bring in discourse 
 We'll have to talk about speech events and we will
have to analyse language as constituting speech event 
And the drama would have to be seen as a series of speech events
put together 
And we will have significations speech that's all about it
Well I think there are but I still think uh that 
one word more and more about it that most of this analysis is
at the le at the level of parole not at the level of langue
because it doesn't go into the soul of literature 
Uh so then I think there needs to be some compromise between old
 what you call philosophical or historical analysis of the text
There must be now two words now just say it's 
a phenolo it's phonologian don't want to touch it
Uhm
Uh if we do that then your analysis is primarily based on
the theories of Roman Jacobs 
Uhm
And over Jacob's and Bob's to a most of
the time what you will what modern people will dismiss as
phonological analysis so that Roman Jacob's and one word
 pushed in it's nothing 
Yeah 
But uh but phonological analysis so we have one needs
to kind of going to uh certain other aspects and we need to broaden 
uh uhm from or your uh uh your theory of style uh then say 
you're basically what's you're doing is as a
modifying partial position 
Ah yes in a way you can say that for Ra Roman
Jacobsan I would say that his theory was a brilliance with it's 
practice 
In practice he was a grammarian cough in theory he was
a phonetician 
And the two well there was a significant between the two 
Uh whereas uh uhm for Bob Bob's known known uh
linguistic facts as well
He would account for known linguistic facts like uh uh 
 For the present one word yes Bob was
not interested in language for say Roman Jacobson was interested
primarily and in a very fundamental way Uh uh the uh the 
language yes or the one word work uh verbal
shiftance yes in Russian
Uh Russian phonology yes or French phonology
 Phonographs like uh like 
 Yeah uh in a way yes 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Yes 
History of French phonology and uh you know and
uh his you know work on Lithuvanian and Latin accent
 Yes yes 
Yes
They all you know basically he was concerned with
language
Even his work on one word is basically how we as a
linguist can handle and help those unfortunate people for this uh
uh speech disorders
Yes we generalise the metaphoric mood and the one word
 mood
But uh but I think Bob's was not concerned about any
of these things
And needed needed and a few words any of them is
concerned with these issues 
So they're actually they should be separated in a way
totally as to separate theorotically approaches to our understanding
of literary texts
Am I right ?
Well as far as uh the scholars themselves are concerned
surely they are talking different things 
But when we approach uh a problem theoritically surely we
have a right to sympathise 
And uh I for one would like to sympathise Simpson's side
 rather extend the Jacobsonian model 
Because if you see the different analysis that Jacobson has made
 of the different texts in French and English and so on 
Always what he has done is he has broken down a text books
grammatical structures and simply partition the grammatical practice 
And that was the one word against him 
That the elements that Roman Jacobson formed in a two words
 could be found in a pattern of a newspaper as well 
So he has dramatical patterning or he does not wants
 want to do the text
I don't think that that the correct position as for as
 Roman Jacobson is concerned because Roman Jacobson is very much
concerned about metres 
You can't have him that cut a newspaper text and say there is
a one word constructed every year
Say for example his analysis of uh great French poet one
word alright where he talks about metres
Pushkins he talks about metres 
You know while no where Bob doesn't mentioned metres 
 Yeah 
So while he had laughs 
That you also have been uh they have been doing it but
trying to escape metres 
No I have not never try to escape metre 
In fact I begin with metrical analysis I begin in phonological
analysis 
That the first level of one word 
The look what I mean is this is that you have not started
 yes building a theory new theory of metres
Specifically using the same old metrical Hollan and
metrical structures and trying to apply them in new thing
This kind of thing was done by Kaiser and Holla in here 
 very interesting book on you know that they have book on
English metres
 Yes 
 Yes yes 
 Yes Kaiser and Holla 
Yes
Alright so what do we do probably how do we my my
concern is how to integrate all these things into main theory of
linguistic analysis 
Yes 
And we must sit down must you know put our minds 
into understanding these problems 
I agree with you basically uh but with one difference
Role of ours is uh analyse is given the uh theoritical
perspective of the analysis of narratives
Uhm uhm 
take for example Chaucer to come back 
So we can't say that he was not language one word or
he was not uh doing literary kind of analysis he was not taking
literature as part of his one word 
He was taking literature as well
But of course his preoccupations much large 
Uhm 
And uh what I mean to say is that of course there is need
to integrate everything
Integrate more into this stylistic theory 
What we have done so far is not that sufficient 
Metre must be seen afresh from new perspective I do agree with you
And uh laughs 
 Let's move back to again
Yes
 Let's try to understand uh the relationship of
Saussure with all these people particularly Saussurian type one word
Yes
And how people have been using them and now and then 
sometime literary people without even understanding uh what is meant by
it you know contrast and opposition it 
What is meant by the Saussure thing that uh all linguistic
analysis is basically an algebra of oppositions and contrasts
Yes
Alright uh even if we leave out all other
But this is exactly
And if really think of that uhm two things
come out of Saussurian analysis very clearly
 Uhm 
Yeah
One is that people don't understand
That this whole theory is based upon two words theory
of one word 
Ah ha 
And other thing that come up very clearly uh all sort
of Sassurian these people are not kind to uh one word I don't
understand that the concept of opposition is basically again Red
Indian and foreigners 
 It's not Saussure
Would you like to elaborate on that ?
Ah yes I can
See uh when you when Saussure talks about that X and Y 
and G uhm are in opposition
And they are in a net net one word of contrast is
there
 Uhm 
Uhm 
Alright
Then the same kind of thing was being said by pre-Paninian 
uh two words authentic
Uhm
That sounds are primarily in a system of contrast and
opposition they do not exist by themselves
Ah that's wonderful
