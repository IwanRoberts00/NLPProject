I am uh Professor Prem Singh of the Department of the
Linguistics University of Delhi 
""
""
I am Ravindra Gargesh  also of the Department of Linguistics
University of Delhi 
""
""
Uh well  the
problems 
""
Uh you see besides  the text in stylistic analysis
 uh what other things you are paying attention to ?
""
You see I am also engaged along with that the whole problem of 
uh uh translation and 
I've  all translations are at
the 
""
Now how does this fitting include  your theory of stylistics and
understanding of a text  ?
""
""
Ah  uh first
of all what comprises 
dis  we have to be micro approach to begin
with the micro approach 
""
Now in the micro approach  we have to see what the text is
constituted of
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
That is the text is a larger  symbol
""
""
""
""
""
""
But what is that symbol made of
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And when we break it into its uh 
 in terms of its language
structures
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Language structures in the sense of  in linguistic terms
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
In the linguistics terms what are the patterns what are the
 or
certain concepts are coded 
""
And then how that codification  does not remain only the prime
way does not contain only primary limits  but it is to have secondary
limits 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
So we have to look at 
""
First level is the level of linguistic structures 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And in second level will be level of lexical significations
""
""
Significations within 
""
""
So what your significance is not really significant in the
sense of  a
particularly there is  company where they are
trying to 
""
You don't seem to be deconstructing the text in any  significant
way where either the  of signification uh
""
a peep into human minds
""
It also believes  a kind of psychological and philosophical and
historical forces involved 
""
""
Very right 
""
Uh we are  these
are variants between French school different way 
""
But that was primarily  because I think the text as way odd
identity 
""
And uh  perhaps I would not like to begin analysis wherever I
want 
""
So that is one defect  in the deconstruction
""
""
You can bring in your subjectivity to interpret the text 
""
Whereas  if human mind is structured
 then definitely the text must also uh
""
""
And if the text has a structure  we have to go from some recent
structure towards the end 
""
""
Basically what you are trying to establish is a kind of a 
grammar of 
""
And you know if I quote uh that these  all grammars leak
""
""
So what are the leakages in your 
""
""
Yes the grammar is weak and there are  major weaks in this
grammar 
""
""
 though in all linguistic
analysis we know  in Panini grammar which is called the perfect
grammar  yeah
 uh would not have needed to write
separately  and then openly didn't need to get up and defend Panini
against Katyayana
""
And sometimes uh you know  uh fun of
himself
""
""
""
""
""
Oh alright 
""
""
 Panini
""
""
""
Ahn
""
""
Uh  what are the
leaks  ?
""
""
Well there are many leaks
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
 leaving everywhere
""
Because firstly there is no comprehensive that the grammar of uh
""
""
There is no comprehensive 
""
For example  a
separate set of parametres 
""
For drama 
we'll 
""
And for stories  or narratives we would require still separate
parametres of analysis 
""
So you see there are multiple levels of analysis
""
""
I I  to catch that I say one
is the phonological one is the morphological level  a
syntactic level in that way  say that at this
parametre of poetry in these parts fiction then these for drama 
""
I say alright 
phonology and  and
text  a fiction is at the level of syntax
""
How would you defend  uh your position against mine this this
""
""
""
""
""
""
 would be uh my position will be at
variance 
""
Uh for poetic analysis I would agree with you that uh 
phonological patterns are significant  morphological pattern are
significant  semantic
configurations will be in the sense of figurative language  are
significant 
""
And how these interact and lead down to larger meaning larger
meaning constructs 
""
But in drama  because by
and large we may have sentences which are incomplete 
""
So there the unit of analysis cannot be a line because poetry would
be line laced or stanzas 
""
But in drama 
""
""
""
 and we will
have to analyse language 
""
And the drama would have to be seen as a series of speech events
put together 
""
And we will have significations speech  all about it
""
""
Well I think there are 
one word  is
at the  not at the level of langue
because it doesn't go 
""
Uh so then I think there needs to be some compromise between old
 what you call philosophical or historical analysis of the text
""
There must be now 
a  don't want to touch it
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Uh if we do that  then your analysis is primarily based on
the theories of Roman Jacobs 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And over  to a most of
the time  what modern people will dismiss as
phonological analysis  one word
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But  so we have one needs
to kind of going to uh 
uh uhm from or your uh uh 
you're  as a
modifying 
""
""
Ah yes  Roman
Jacobsan I would say that his theory was a brilliance with 
practice 
""
In practice he was a grammarian  in theory he was
a phonetician 
""
And the two well there was a significant between the two 
""
Uh whereas uh uhm for Bob  known known uh
linguistic facts as well
""
He would account for known linguistic facts like uh uh 
""
""
 yes Bob was
not interested in language for say  Roman Jacobson was interested
primarily and 
language  work uh verbal
shiftance  in Russian
""
Uh Russian phonology  or French phonology
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
History of  and uh you know and
uh his you know work on Lithuvanian and Latin accent
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
They all  concerned with
language
""
Even his work on  we as a
linguist can handle and help  uh
uh speech disorders
""
""
Yes we generalise the metaphoric mood and the  one word
 mood
""
""
But uh but I think  was not concerned about any
of these things
""
And needed  any of them is
concerned with these issues 
""
So  actually they should be separated in a way
totally  theorotically approaches to our understanding
of literary texts
""
Am I right  ?
""
""
Well as far as uh the scholars themselves are concerned
surely they are talking different things 
""
But when we approach uh  surely we
have a right to sympathise 
""
And uh I for one would like to sympathise  side
""
""
Because if you see the different analysis that Jacobson has made
""
""
Always what he has done is  he has broken down a text books
grammatical structures and simply partition the grammatical practice 
""
And that was the 
""
That the elements that Roman Jacobson formed in a  two words
""
""
So he has dramatical patterning  wants
 to do the text
""
""
I don't think that  that the correct position as for as
 Roman Jacobson is very much
concerned about metres 
""
You can't have him  that cut a newspaper text and say there is
a  every year
""
Say for example his analysis of uh  one
word  he talks about metres
""
Pushkins he talks about metres 
""
You know while 
""
""
""
""
""
So while he had 
""
""
That you also have been uh they have been doing it  but
trying to escape 
""
""
No I have not never try to escape metre 
""
In fact I begin with metrical analysis  I begin in phonological
analysis 
""
That the first level of 
""
""
The look what I mean is this is  that you have not started
 of metres
""
Specifically using the same old metrical  and
metrical structures and trying to apply them  in new thing
""
This kind of thing was done by 
 you know that they have book on
English metres
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
Alright  probably how do we my my
concern is  into main theory of
linguistic analysis 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And we must sit down 
into understanding 
""
""
I agree with you basically  uh but with one difference
""
""
Role of ours is  uh theoritical
perspective of the analysis of narratives
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
take for example Chaucer to come back 
""
So we can't say that he was not language  or
he was not  he was not taking
literature as 
""
He was taking literature as well
""
But of course his preoccupations much large 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh  what I mean to say is that of course there is need
to integrate everything
""
Integrate 
""
What we have done so far is not that sufficient 
""
Metre must be seen afresh from new perspective I do agree with you
""
""
And uh 
""
""
 move back to again
""
""
Yes
""
""
 uh the relationship of
Saussure with all these people  one word
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
And how people have been using them 
sometime literary people without even understanding  uh what is meant by
it 
""
What is meant by the Saussure thing that  uh all linguistic
analysis  is basically an algebra of oppositions and contrasts
""
""
Yes
""
""
Alright  uh even if we leave out all other
""
""
But this is exactly
""
""
And if really think of that  two things
come out of Saussurian  very clearly
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
One is  people don't understand
""
That this whole theory is based upon  theory
of 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
And other thing that come up  uh all sort
of Sassurian these people are not kind to uh  I don't
understand  is basically again Red
Indian and foreigners 
""
 not Saussure
""
""
Would you like to elaborate on that ?
""
""
Ah yes I can
""
See 
and G  are in opposition
""
And they are in a net  of contrast is
there
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Alright
""
Then the same kind of thing was being said by 
uh  authentic
""
""
Uhm
""
""
That sounds are primarily  in a system of contrast and
opposition they do not exist by themselves
""
""
Ah
