I am uh Professor Prem Singh of the Department of the
""
""
""
""
University of Delhi 
""
""
Uh well  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah  uh first
""
""
with the micro approach 
""
""
constituted of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in terms of its language
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Language structures in the sense of  in linguistic terms
""
""
""
""
""
""
In the linguistics terms what are the patterns what are the
""
certain concepts are coded 
""
""
way does not contain only primary limits  but it is to have secondary
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
First level is the level of linguistic structures 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And in second level will be level of lexical significations
""
""
Significations within 
""
""
So what your significance is not really significant in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh we are  these
are variants between French school different way 
""
But that was primarily  because I think the text as way odd
identity 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Basically what you are trying to establish is a kind of a 
""
""
""
""
""
So what are the leakages in your 
""
""
""
grammar 
""
""
 though in all linguistic
""
grammar  yeah
""
separately  and then openly didn't need to get up and defend Panini
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 Panini
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
separate set of parametres 
""
""
we'll 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is the phonological one is the morphological level  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
phonological patterns are significant  morphological pattern are
""
""
significant 
""
And how these interact and lead down to larger meaning larger
""
""
But in drama  because by
""
""
So there the unit of analysis cannot be a line because poetry would
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
have to analyse language 
""
And the drama would have to be seen as a series of speech events
put together 
""
""
""
""
""
one word  is
""
because it doesn't go 
""
""
""
""
""
a  don't want to touch it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to kind of going to uh 
""
you're  as a
modifying 
""
""
""
Jacobsan I would say that his theory was a brilliance with 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh whereas uh uhm for Bob  known known uh
""
""
He would account for known linguistic facts like uh uh 
""
""
""
not interested in language for say  Roman Jacobson was interested
primarily and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh his you know work on Lithuvanian and Latin accent
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes we generalise the metaphoric mood and the  one word
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of literary texts
""
Am I right  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because if you see the different analysis that Jacobson has made
""
""
""
grammatical structures and simply partition the grammatical practice 
""
And that was the 
""
That the elements that Roman Jacobson formed in a  two words
""
""
""
 to do the text
""
""
I don't think that  that the correct position as for as
 Roman Jacobson is very much
concerned about metres 
""
You can't have him  that cut a newspaper text and say there is
""
""
""
""
""
Pushkins he talks about metres 
""
You know while 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
trying to escape 
""
""
""
""
""
analysis 
""
That the first level of 
""
""
The look what I mean is this is  that you have not started
""
""
""
""
""
""
 you know that they have book on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
concern is  into main theory of
linguistic analysis 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And we must sit down 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
take for example Chaucer to come back 
""
""
he was not  he was not taking
literature as 
""
He was taking literature as well
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to integrate everything
""
""
""
What we have done so far is not that sufficient 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sometime literary people without even understanding  uh what is meant by
it 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
Alright  uh even if we leave out all other
""
""
But this is exactly
""
""
And if really think of that  two things
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
of Sassurian these people are not kind to uh  I don't
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah yes I can
""
""
and G  are in opposition
""
""
there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then the same kind of thing was being said by 
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
