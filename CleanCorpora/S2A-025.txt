<I>
Good morning 
Uh this is a short paper called Teaching classics in an
unclassical situation 
Uh I didn't know what to do when I received a letter from uh
Professor Vanikar uh asking me to participate in a lecture
series 
So I thought that I must write a lecture 
But I didn't know that this is all this 
But anyway I I hope you'll bear uh these peculiar
things from a teacher who has been trying to teach something impossible
 uh for several years 
When the Indira Gandhi Open University was
launched some years ago somebody mentioned to me why an open university
was needed then 
Most of the Northern universities had to be closed for long
spells of time owing to one agitation or the other 
And they had been sealed closed 
The only university that could be open then was the open one
 which could not be closed 
When I asked in a time honoured university a few years ago 
where was the student ?
The teacher said since attendance was voluntary the
students were not around 
This had shocked me then thoroughly 
But when the same reason was given by another set of teachers 
in another university equally respected just a few days ago I
was not so much dismayed as amused 
A university now was getting one word of becoming 
a fossil 
A discarded image and a discreditable model 
We say the teacher you have to squeeze the university into
museum and a teacher into a zoo now 
When teaching itself has become a well-nigh lost art practised
 before the modern stone age teaching a classic should be a gargantuan
to an absurdity or a quixotic misadventure 
But though the teaching of a classic really belong to the realm
of such a dark and hopeless comedy my experience with both the
classics and the teaching has been mercifully otherwise 
I may be allowed to boast that even like the classics
themselves I've survived as a teacher teaching classics
 that too in an Indian situation 
At the movement I need not define a classic since everyone
knows what it is since you have to know what a thing is even to
reject it 
 I'll rather explain what an unclassical situation is
Apart from the unclassical situation in the West itself 
which even Milton feared in his own time whether he was writing his epic
in an age too late in a cold climate my damp is intended flight 
The Indian situation for the western classics especially the
ancient one is apparently precarious 
Homer or Virgil Dante or Milton are not only not read in
the schools or undergraduate classes here perhaps with exception of some
Milton but well are unheard of 
There is no grounding or even interest in pagan mythology or
christian thought of any real depth before the students join the
post graduate classes 
Nor is there any serious attention to the history of ideas 
or evolution of the western culture is Greek or Roman Christian texture
Any knowledge of Greek and Latin or even a gentle fascination
for them is anywhere in sight is nowhere in sight 
Again there is no knowledge or sense of the genuises rise
evolution and decay of the stars of epic tragedies romance 
allegory etcetera 
Nor is there a critical awareness or discuss 
 discussions or the matters involved in the study of
the classics among the extremist either 
In short as far the teaching of the classics is concerned you
are working in a thorough vacuum 
Though your teacher's nature may abhor it 
If you have to reach the students with your classics in your uh
 ah in your hand you have to undertake the adventure of piercing
through a silence of seven-fold or nine-fold or manifold ignorance 
But should you despair and give up the sword of teaching then
as a sheer wild goose chase 
 I've an emphatic no to say to this
pessimism 
It is possible to put those classics across to the students 
Indian students not because they are the one word or credilous
 but because the classics have an intrensic power in themselves
 on the one hand and students have an intrensic an instinctive
responsiveness to them on the other 
Should a classic fail it's a pity 
Something must be wrong either with the teacher or with the
student and between them they have missed an opportunity of a life-time
It is a challenge for any teacher to steer an ancient classic
through successfully in a class without being assisted by a cultivated
response in it 
But I think the solution to the problem should be divide
another way 
Instead of being exasperated by a classical innocent class a
teacher has to exploit the virgin field and convert innocence into an
advantage 
The basic wealth he should realize lies in the
responsiveness of the class to any literature our literature British
or one's own 
Once he's sure of the aesthetic or literary sensibility
 so he can find a way for the classic into the imagination of his students
When I say that a literary awareness is the most vital factor I
do not employ that a classic should be reduced to an easily knowable text
The teacher should have a complex economy at his command 
He must know uh the right dosage of each element before he
administers a classic to the open minded class students of
the class 
Were one to teach for example Homer's 
Illiad I I've taken just one example 
One must know how much of the theory of the epic of growth or
archeology he must give to his students 
If you get lost in the theory of the oral or authentic epic you
may not reach Homer at all 
On the contrary you may raise serious suspicion in the
minds of the students whether a poet called Homer ever existed at all 
Having introduced the term authentic oral epic you gently
pass on to the Homeric age or the heroic age not as a fossil of
history but as a genuine milieu for the creation and sustenance of the
kind of epic that Illiad is 
If the students know nothing of the heroic age Achilles would
cut an utterly sorry figure before them a spoiled child a wilful
imbecile 
Personal honour then was supreme and dying for glory the
consummation devastly wished by a hero was his name 
The co-ordinates of the age co-ordinate coincide with the
co-ordinates of the morality of the hero 
The Lords have donned a heroic society have to be 
ac accepted in a spirit of willing suspension of
disbelief or of a voluntary poetic accent 
By this the epic is saved an enormous infancy of
primitivity 
With a select historisity in mind you go straight to the human
condition 
So that given differing historical co-ordinate 
There is an unerring core of the human fate involved 
Once the right key note is struck the classic is preserved 
Similarly you have to introduce them to the rules of the epic
game the conventions the invocation the catalogues of men and
ships and so on 
The strolling epic simile the ruthlessly delightful
battlefields the feudal games the lamentations etcetera 
And then the gods their politics their devious ways 
their over-determinations of human affairs and man's constant
negotiations with them 
The supernatural frame-work not to be reduced to the
supernatural machinery that they use one word but to be kept 
as a mysterious divine environment in which man has to struggle rise
afore 
You have to identify and establish the force of gravity 
that holds in tension the fears of men 
All this has to be done not in a spirit of solemn scholarship 
but as a matter of enlighten information to hinder the hindrances to
enjoying such works 
But this is only half the work 
You have to get the work closer to the world of the students'
 own experience or sensibility 
I have been trying to do this task not by denuding Homer of its
specific but by gathering him to a vision of what I might describe as
 poets' perennial 
The perennial poetry which refuses to divide poetic experience
or vision in a parochial way and reduce reduce it to a poets'
 parochialist uh provincial poetry 
Explain the unknown Homer in terms of the known of
 the Upanishadas the Vedas the Bhagwatgeetas the
Mahabharat and the Ramayan and the Bhagwat 
Do not tell me that our own works are less known to our
students than the western classics 
I have been doing in this way from long before the TV's
 had serialised the Mahabharat and 
the Ramayan 
Our work the culture that they are embodiments of our
already embedded in the instinctive responses of our students 
And they have to be carefully and convincingly evoked by the
teacher 
Let me give just a couple of examples in a characteristically
comprehensive Homeric statement 
In the thick of the battle Dimades challenges Glocus and Glocus
replies what does any lineage matter to you 
Men in the generations are like the leaves of the tree 
The wind blows and one years leaves are scattered on the ground
 but the tree is burst into buds and put on fresh ones when the
spring comes round 
In the same way one generation flourishes and the another nears
its end 
This inevitably reminded me of the statement from the 
Katho Upanishad Satya mevap madhya pakshatye sasya mev
tasya mev ajayte punha 
The muscle hyphens and ripens ends like corn and stalks
up again like corn 
The metaphor of the leaves in Homer corresponds greatly with
metaphor of the corn in the Katho Upanishad 
And both bring out vividly and crystalize the phenomenon of
mutability 
The cycle of birth death and rebirth 
The Homeric metaphor as that of the Upanishadic unites
human experience so effectively that you cease to separate the west from
the east and start inhabiting a common state of human faith 
To cite another example from the Illiad itself
 here is Andromache Illiad book six trying to
persuade her husband Hector not to go to the fatal battlefield 
 So you Hector are father and mother and brother to
me as well as my beloved husband 
Have pity on me now stay here on the tar 
Put beside this a statement from the Ramayana
 made by Seeta as a confession of Rama's love for her
 before Anusuya 
This is Ayodhyakand one eighteen four uh
 Seetanurago dharmatma matrivat pitravat priyah 
With this kind of a parallel so this is I think you will know
this Sanskrit I mean the student 
Seeta in love righteous dear like the father the mother 
With the kind of a parallel in mind you do not wish to separate
the two works the two culture and see them in isolation a bridge
is flown across the two 
And the one text reinforces and illuminates the other the
phobia that a stranger one word is dissipated and an Indian
reader student teacher is gratified that a common humanity pervades text
apparently separated by differing cultures and languages 
When I say this I am not way laying the students into the
phony field of the comparative literature as such but only knocking down
walls or barriers that separates two literatures 
It is a matter of of nativising alien an alien
literature not by sipping it of its specifics but by opening a new
channel of communication 
So many problems of interpretation both literary and
theological can be lightened by calling to aid works like the
Mahabharat Ramayan Bhagwat and pressing them to a
service to to into service to gain and access into a pre-Christian
work like Illiad which raises insoluble problems in
the mind of western Christian reader 
I have tried to put across Illiad without
tearing off its Roman roots to my students by a free use of material 
from our ancient texts 
The benefit has been double if not multiple 
Our students have freely enter the western classics with a native
appreciation of them on the one hand and I've seen the relevance
 and significance of our own work on the other 
There was a time when the professor of English looked down
upon our works in a bid to outer English to English 
Those days I wish to believe are behind us but that
also implies a responsibility a need to emancipate oneself from
bookishness into a heaven of genuine learning 
 I've been tackling works like the Illiad 
Paradise Lost The Divine Comedy with an amount of freedom
to release the classics from the prison of impenetrability or mere tacit
riven and make them speak to us as living works 
 I've also been trying to light up areas of darkness 
in interpreting our own works like the Mahabharat Ramayan
the Bhagwat all these or the Bhagwatgeeta 
by a constant reference to the Illiad the Aeneid Paradise Lost
or The Divine Comedy so that a new discourse is generated 
by the free jostling together of great works 
This has helped remove to a great extent the grimness 
or the the gravity the solemnity that seem to weigh upon our own works
 fallen on the trodden ways of orthodoxy 
The use of the Bible both the old and the new Testament 
the entire western mystical tradition uh has been of great benefit in
the interpretation of our own works too 
Here again the walls of prejudice and wooden scholarship collapse
 and the great work starts becoming parts of the same space the
aesthetic and the ethical 
 I've also been getting appreciable success bringing
together the Greek and the Shakespearian tragedies 
Understanding a Greek phenomenon with a Shakespearian example 
or vice-versa 
Should I read more and be conversant with Sanskrit drama I
hope to understand the more by a kind of a cross irradiation 
What I've uh been doing with the ancient classics 
classics should be possible with the post- renaissance modern and
post-modern works too 
But one needs to be sailing the razor edge path of one if one were
not to mess up things 
This kind of activity needs a great expansion of mind an
intellectual tolerance that makes holding many peaks of excellance or
phenomenon of significance together simultaneously without reducing or
abolishing the uniqueness of each 
I also felt always that a teacher needs to be free from any
obsession with one particular theory of literature or or
criticism
If you they want to save themselves
from the dangers of distortion 
At the same time he must be fully aware of the whole plethora
of the theory so that he is able to make use of them freely 
even as an electronics engineer uses a thousand of keys to produce a
unified effect 
I may however say that my key to the classics is only a key a
key and I do not know of a master-key which can unlock uh the
treasures of all literature 
I do not exactly know where I stand as regard to theme of the
lecture series creative writing and literature teaching interphase 
But this much I can say that literature teaching is not 
much less creative than creative writing itself 
In fact you create as you teach 
And a creative work unless it is creatively read remains just
a close book it does not become a text to borrow a term from Burke
It is a teacher who stigmaties to teach a text can really
transform it into what it really is a text which requires as
Burke would say an attempt to abolish or atleast to lessen the
distance between writing and reading not by intensifying the readers 
projection into the work but by linking the two together in a single
signifying process 
A teacher if he succeeds does reduce the distance between
writing and reading 
He rewrites the works and reincarnate the text everytime
 he successfully performs in a class 
Thank you
