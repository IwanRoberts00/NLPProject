Good morning 
""
""
unclassical situation 
""
Uh I didn't know what to do when I received a letter from  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But anyway I  these peculiar
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The only university that could be open then  was the open one
""
""
When I asked in a time honoured university a few years ago 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But when the same reason was given by another set of teachers 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
When teaching itself has become a well-nigh lost art  practised
""
to an absurdity 
""
But  though the teaching of a classic really belong to the realm
of such a dark and hopeless comedy  both the
""
""
I may be allowed to boast  that even like the classics
themselves  teaching classics
""
""
""
knows what it is  even to
""
""
 what an unclassical situation is
""
""
Apart from the unclassical situation 
which even Milton feared in his own time  whether he was writing his epic
""
""
""
ancient one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
christian thought  join the
""
""
Nor is there any serious attention 
""
""
""
Any knowledge of Greek and Latin  or even a gentle fascination
""
""
""
""
allegory etcetera 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 of piercing
""
""
But should you despair and give up the sword of teaching  then
as a sheer wild goose chase 
""
""
pessimism 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
another way 
""
""
""
""
""
The basic wealth  lies in the
""
or 
""
Once  sure of the aesthetic or literary sensibility
""
""
""
""
do not employ that a classic should be reduced to an  easily knowable text
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
archeology 
""
If you get lost in the theory of the oral or authentic epic  you
""
""
""
""
""
Having introduced the term authentic  you gently
""
""
kind of epic that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The co-ordinates of the age  coincide with the
""
""
""
""
disbelief 
""
By this  of
""
""
With a select historisity in mind  you go straight to the human
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Similarly you have to introduce them  to the rules of the epic
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
negotiations 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All this has to be done not in a spirit of solemn scholarship 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

Mahabharat

Do not tell me that our own works  are less known to our
students 
""
""
""
""
""
Our work  our
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
replies what does any lineage matter to you 
""
Men in the generations 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
up again like corn 
""
The metaphor of the leaves in Homer  corresponds greatly with
metaphor of the corn 
""
And both bring out  vividly and crystalize the phenomenon of
""
""
The cycle of birth death and rebirth 
""
The Homeric metaphor  unites
""
the east 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Put beside this  Ramayana
""
""
""
This is Ayodhyakand  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is flown across the two 
""
And the one text reinforces and illuminates the other  the
""
reader student teacher is gratified  that a common humanity pervades text
""
""
When I say this  into the
phony field of the comparative literature  as such but only knocking down
""
""
It is a matter of  an alien
""
""
""
So many problems of interpretation  both literary and
""
""
service to to  into service to gain and access into a pre-Christian
""
the mind of western Christian reader 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
appreciation of them  seen the relevance
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in interpreting our own works  Ramayan
""
by a constant reference to the  the Aeneid Paradise Lost
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the interpretation of our own works 
""
Here again the walls of prejudice and wooden scholarship collapse
""
aesthetic and the ethical 
""
 appreciable success bringing
""
""
""
or vice-versa 
""
Should I read more  I
hope to understand the more by a kind of a cross irradiation 
""
What 
classics should be possible  and
post-modern works too 
""
But one needs to be sailing the razor edge path of one if one were
""
""
""
""
phenomenon of significance together  simultaneously without reducing or
abolishing the uniqueness of each 
""
I also felt always  that a teacher needs to be free from any
""
criticism
""
""
from the dangers of distortion 
""
""
""
""
unified effect 
""
I may however say that my key to the classics is only a key  a
""
treasures 
""
I do not exactly know  where I stand as regard to theme of the
""
""
""
much less creative 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is a teacher  can really
""
""
distance between writing and reading 
""
signifying process
