Good morning 
""
Uh  Teaching classics in an
unclassical situation 
""
Uh I didn't know what to do when I received a letter from  uh
Professor Vanikar  lecture
series 
""
So I thought that I must write a lecture 
""
But I didn't know that this is all this 
""
But anyway I  these peculiar
things from a teacher  who has been trying to teach something impossible
""
""
When the  was
launched some years ago  somebody mentioned to me why an open university
was needed then 
""
Most of the Northern universities had to be closed  for long
spells of time 
""
And they had been sealed closed 
""
The only university that could be open then  was the open one
""
""
When I asked in a time honoured university a few years ago 
where was the student  ?
""
The teacher said  the
students were not around 
""
This had shocked me 
""
But when the same reason was given by another set of teachers 
in another university  I
was not so much dismayed 
""
A university now was getting 
a fossil 
""
A discarded image 
""
We say the teacher  you have to squeeze the university into
museum 
""
When teaching itself has become a well-nigh lost art  practised
 teaching a classic should be a gargantuan
to an absurdity 
""
But  though the teaching of a classic really belong to the realm
of such a dark and hopeless comedy  both the
classics 
""
I may be allowed to boast  that even like the classics
themselves  teaching classics
""
""
At the movement  since everyone
knows what it is  even to
reject it 
""
 what an unclassical situation is
""
""
Apart from the unclassical situation 
which even Milton feared in his own time  whether he was writing his epic
in an age too late 
""
The Indian situation for the western classics  especially the
ancient one 
""
Homer or Virgil  are not only not read in
the schools or undergraduate classes here  perhaps with exception of some
Milton 
""
There is no grounding or even interest in pagan mythology  or
christian thought  join the
post graduate classes 
""
Nor is there any serious attention 
or evolution of the western culture  is Greek or Roman Christian texture
""
""
Any knowledge of Greek and Latin  or even a gentle fascination
for them 
""
Again  rise
evolution and decay of the stars of epic 
allegory etcetera 
""
Nor is there a critical awareness 
 or the matters involved in the study of
the classics 
""
In short as far the teaching of the classics is concerned  you
are working in a thorough vacuum 
""
Though your 
""
If you have to reach the students with your classics  in your uh
 of piercing
through a silence of seven-fold or nine-fold 
""
But should you despair and give up the sword of teaching  then
as a sheer wild goose chase 
""
 to say to this
pessimism 
""
It is possible to put those classics across 
Indian students  or credilous
 in themselves
 and students have an intrensic an instinctive
responsiveness 
""
Should a classic fail 
""
Something must be wrong either with the teacher  or with the
student  and between them they have missed an opportunity of a life-time
""
""
It is a challenge for any teacher  to steer an ancient classic
through successfully  in a class without being assisted by a cultivated
response in it 
""
But I think the solution to the problem should  divide
another way 
""
Instead of being exasperated by a classical innocent class  a
teacher has to exploit the virgin field  and convert innocence into an
advantage 
""
The basic wealth  lies in the
responsiveness of the class to any literature  British
or 
""
Once  sure of the aesthetic or literary sensibility
 so he can find a way for the classic into the imagination of his students
""
""
When I say that a literary awareness is the most vital factor  I
do not employ that a classic should be reduced to an  easily knowable text
""
""
The teacher should have a complex economy at his command 
""
He must know  before he
administers a classic  students of
the class 
""
Were one 
Illiad 
""
One must know how much of the theory of the epic of growth  or
archeology 
""
If you get lost in the theory of the oral or authentic epic  you
may not reach Homer at all 
""
On the contrary  in the
minds of the students 
""
Having introduced the term authentic  you gently
pass on to the Homeric age  not as a fossil of
history  but as a genuine milieu for the creation and sustenance of the
kind of epic that 
""
If the students know nothing of the heroic age  Achilles would
cut an utterly sorry figure before them  a wilful
imbecile 
""
Personal honour then was supreme  the
consummation 
""
The co-ordinates of the age  coincide with the
co-ordinates of the morality of the hero 
""
The Lords have donned a heroic society 
ac  in a spirit of willing suspension of
disbelief 
""
By this  of
primitivity 
""
With a select historisity in mind  you go straight to the human
condition 
""
So that given 
""
There is an unerring core of the human fate involved 
""
Once the right key note is struck the classic is preserved 
""
Similarly you have to introduce them  to the rules of the epic
game  the catalogues of men and
ships and so on 
""
The strolling epic simile  the ruthlessly delightful
battlefields 
""
And then the gods 
their over-determinations of human affairs  constant
negotiations 
""
The supernatural frame-work  not to be reduced to the
supernatural machinery 
as a mysterious divine environment in which man has to struggle  rise
afore 
""
You have to identify and establish 
that holds in tension 
""
All this has to be done not in a spirit of solemn scholarship 
but as a matter of enlighten information  to
enjoying such works 
""
But this is only half the work 
""
You have to get the work closer to the world of the  students'
""
""
I have been trying to do this  task not by denuding Homer of its
specific  as
""
""
The perennial poetry  which refuses to divide poetic experience
or vision in a parochial way and reduce  poets'
""
""
Explain the unknown Homer  of
 the
Mahabharat 
""
Do not tell me that our own works  are less known to our
students 
""
I have been doing  TV's
""
the Ramayan 
""
Our work  our
already embedded in the instinctive responses of our students 
""
And they have to be carefully and convincingly evoked by the
teacher 
""
Let me give just a couple of examples  in a characteristically
comprehensive Homeric statement 
""
In the thick of the battle  Dimades challenges Glocus and Glocus
replies what does any lineage matter to you 
""
Men in the generations 
""
The wind blows  and one years leaves are scattered on the ground
 when the
spring comes round 
""
In the same way  one generation flourishes and the another nears
its end 
""
This 
Katho Upanishad  Satya mevap madhya pakshatye sasya mev
tasya mev ajayte punha 
""
The muscle hyphens and  and stalks
up again like corn 
""
The metaphor of the leaves in Homer  corresponds greatly with
metaphor of the corn 
""
And both bring out  vividly and crystalize the phenomenon of
mutability 
""
The cycle of birth death and rebirth 
""
The Homeric metaphor  unites
human experience  so effectively that you cease to separate the west from
the east 
""
To cite another example from the  itself
 trying to
persuade her husband Hector not to go to the fatal battlefield 
""
 and brother to
me 
""
Have pity on me now 
""
Put beside this  Ramayana
 love for her
""
""
This is Ayodhyakand  uh
""
""
With this kind of a parallel  so this is I think you will know
this Sanskrit 
""
Seeta in love 
""
With the kind of a parallel in mind  you do not wish to separate
the two works  a bridge
is flown across the two 
""
And the one text reinforces and illuminates the other  the
phobia that a stranger  and an Indian
reader student teacher is gratified  that a common humanity pervades text
apparently separated by differing cultures 
""
When I say this  into the
phony field of the comparative literature  as such but only knocking down
walls or barriers that separates two literatures 
""
It is a matter of  an alien
literature  but by opening a new
channel of communication 
""
So many problems of interpretation  both literary and
theological  the
Mahabharat  to a
service to to  into service to gain and access into a pre-Christian
work  which raises insoluble problems in
the mind of western Christian reader 
""
I have tried to put across  without
tearing off its Roman roots 
from our ancient texts 
""
The benefit has been double if not multiple 
""
Our students have freely enter the western classics with a native
appreciation of them  seen the relevance
""
""
There was a time when the professor of English  looked down
upon our works 
""
Those days  but that
also implies a responsibility  a need to emancipate oneself from
bookishness 
""
""
Paradise Lost  with an amount of freedom
to release the classics from the prison of impenetrability  or mere tacit
riven 
""
""
in interpreting our own works  Ramayan
the Bhagwat 
by a constant reference to the  the Aeneid Paradise Lost
or The Divine Comedy 
by the free jostling together 
""
This has helped remove 
or the the gravity  the solemnity that seem to weigh upon our own works
""
""
The use of the Bible 
the entire western mystical tradition  has been of great benefit in
the interpretation of our own works 
""
Here again the walls of prejudice and wooden scholarship collapse
 the
aesthetic and the ethical 
""
 appreciable success bringing
together the Greek and the Shakespearian tragedies 
""
Understanding a Greek phenomenon with a Shakespearian example 
or vice-versa 
""
Should I read more  I
hope to understand the more by a kind of a cross irradiation 
""
What 
classics should be possible  and
post-modern works too 
""
But one needs to be sailing the razor edge path of one if one were
not to mess up things 
""
This kind of activity needs a great expansion of mind  an
intellectual tolerance  that makes holding many peaks of excellance or
phenomenon of significance together  simultaneously without reducing or
abolishing the uniqueness of each 
""
I also felt always  that a teacher needs to be free from any
obsession  or
criticism
""
If  want to save themselves
from the dangers of distortion 
""
At the same time  he must be fully aware of the whole plethora
of the theory 
even as an electronics engineer  to produce a
unified effect 
""
I may however say that my key to the classics is only a key  a
key  uh the
treasures 
""
I do not exactly know  where I stand as regard to theme of the
lecture series 
""
But this much I can say 
much less creative 
""
In fact 
""
And a creative work unless it is creatively read  remains just
a close book  to borrow a term from Burke
""
""
It is a teacher  can really
transform it into what it really is  as
Burke would say  or atleast to lessen the
distance between writing and reading 
projection  in a single
signifying process 
""
A teacher  does reduce the distance between
writing and reading 
""
He rewrites the works  everytime

Thank you
