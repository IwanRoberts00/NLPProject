<I>
Anything which is spoken in India will be Indian English or
 a particular type of English will be called Indian English 
No I think English spoken here in the Indian context 
 in on the Indian soil that's what we 
 saying say India English 
And there will be different types of Indian English 
Indian English one two three and so on
There must be different types of Indian Englishes because we
have different varieties of languages spoken here in India varieties
means different families of languages spoken here in India
Or how many of this is the most Indian of all these Indian
Englishes again becomes a question 
Yeah that's true 
I think that is one of his task to find out 
 We can ask him also
 So when was 
When was this when was this started this subject of
Indian English 
I think it started around sixtees so I feel
I remember in the college uh Mr uh I forgot
the name of this English teacher but it is on my tongue
Yes 
He brought the book uh Common Errors in in
Indian Literature he mentioned certain things like
 a big size a big big size 
What is that that's like
 Nahi big size 
 Achha what's that one
An Arab stays in the big size what you say
I see 
But he said it's a wrong English 
it's a wrong English and it should be like he he
 he recommended some other books for the use
So what are what is the what books did you have
I forgot I was giving an example
Okay 
So that kind of thing with Indian English or what is
Indian English that wrong wrong one so called wrong one in
Indian English or right one in Indian English 
No no you cannot say wrong one or right one not I think
there are some influences and interferences from the mother tongues 
Oh
The newspeak English it's a 
one word 
 So the concept is changing those days 
certain things spoken in Indian English were considered wrong
Wrong that's it
And now even a wrong ones are Indian English I think
So whatever English which is spoken here in India I think
these are all rule governed because there is no language which is not
rule governed 
So in that way you cannot say that Indian English is spoken here in
India is wrong
But uh many people in India speak English with
the 
Yeah even we will make one of
No no I what I mean to say is uh many people in India
speak English in the wrong tense uh wrong wrong construction 
 yeah that kind of thing
 Yeah 
So how do you 
And the one word is where past participle to be
used yeah present is used that kind of a yeah
 that kind of thing
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
That kind of thing 
So how many speak English 
So that is that is
Is it is it to be categorised as wrong English or Indian
English 
It can't be categorised as wrong English it is to be
categorised as Indian English
But you must remember is 
Yes 
You remember your collegues 
Yes 
And uh his English laughter 
So uh I want to say I want to tell something I
want to say something or the other to you means
No I can teach English uh I don't know what kind of
English is this but that's sometimes there are
Englishes which are spoken by local people which are quite intolerable like
 That means 
 Haan if you can consider it as a very very
extreme form of Indian English or 
I think
No you have to you will define a range
Yeah that's yes that's what
 You've to define your range or to which you can
consider something as Indian English yes so I think that
 Yes 
So even even Indian English no there must be
established Indian English I think that uh should be
brought out
 No 
 Uh 
Something as Indian English
So that will be taken as a variety of Indian English 
So you say like an example I remember uh a song
 which was uh uh written in Kannada when I was in Bangalore 
several years back this song was very popular uh this this 
English song uh this song is sung by a gardener or a helper 
to a rich maiden uh rich lady 
So the song goes in Kannada mixed with English 
Kannada Kannada interspersed with English English uh English
words broken English words so the language goes madam giving giving
money
Without any word without any one word 
 Haan madam madam give me money I bring in
clouds 
So suppose and this is not a concocted example 
many people 
Yeah
Specially helpers who know something this is they
are going to speak
Yes
So this is cooked up in your mind some certains
 certain words it is simple
I think that that why
So we we consider Indian
Kannada English or will we consider is something which can be
considered English 
So that we have to decide up upto what level you
can considered it an English proper I mean uh proper English or even
proper language 
Yes 
Because unless you define a range anything which is
cooked up even a a monkey or a even a computer which stores
certain things jumbled up
Yeah 
You mix words jumble it up and what whatever comes
out you'll say is Indian English or African English 
depending on where it is spoken 
Yeah the interference is from mother tongue that they
have all this interference is like people used to consider is uh as
a mistake but those mistakes uh they they used to sort of reject the
mistakes 
Now these mistakes are normal considered as unwanted element 
they in fact on the basis of error which are made by the speakers 
of different communities are tak taken as a strategy 
So that uh after chronicling this strategy they can
 uh what to say they can make uh plan
Yeah I remember uh another form of very interesting Indian
English which was spoken in J N U where I studied 
Uh J N U in the evening uh you have to see the J N U uh
you can visit until seven people thronging the bus and they talk
Marxism art cultural dance debating so all those uh smart
 girls and boys in J N U used to sit together and they used to talk
as not all not all of them 
But certain classes among them
Yeah 
Who had rich fathers or you know with uh uhn higher
incomes or you know where a certain kind of life style 
Yes yeah 
Yes this this one includes there 
 Yeah this one like 
Pardon uh 
You cannot have to bring the tea here no 
Yes 
No you tell him to bring it you bring it here
Ah here here one ah here it is there
What form of two words 
Oh sorry
 That's too much one word know you should
 one or two words 
When I think of two this thank you haan
 
So I think it's already two min 
it's already ten minutes more than ten minutes no
 Let's hope another another few lines and this
Okay
It will be over so I remember 
Uh
I was just pacing out wherin
Yeah 
So there names speak some changes like uh you know 
uh uh one word yesterday you know uh in Hindi 
You know he's wear the jean he brought was impressing you
know
 That's I think that's uh
That kind of thing you see 
Then uh I saw with my friend uh you know what what Michael
says in Hindi but but you know I can write it one word that
kind of so mixed English
Yeah got one
You know we you know what happened when you say something 
 uhn in Hindi then you continue with English
 Uhn 
 That's what you call code mixing 
So what is it is it Indian Hindi English or Indian Hindi
English ?
So that's what makes a construction
And there is something called
 One or two words 
I wanted to ask professor Shastri here something is called
Hinglish 
Hinglish
Uhn
I know Hinjali 
Not Hinjali Hinglish Hinglish
Hinglish means 
H I N
Yeah I know Hinglish 
Yeah
Hindi English
Yeah 
Combined 
English spoken by you know 
Hindi speakers 
Hindi speaking but of course they won't be speaking these
people 
 Accha 
Where you know Hinglish is modified according to their
convenience 
 Haan uh so where did you come across
this English 
This comes in newspapers in printed news 
Hinglish once I came across like Hinjali 
isn't it
 Hinjali I don't know 
Hindi you remember I think uh 
So in English I have come across but Hinjali I don't
know
 Hinjali it's uh I think their argument
influences in Punjabi from I think nil the other way round there are
some influences of Punjabi songs in Hindi 
Uhm that way it could be 
But it's 
That 
But there is something different na 
Yeah that is also something different 
 That 
Their way
I just remember that uh that one
And we
I remember the words 
Yeah another form of variants of English
Yeah but what is it 
 Indian English will be considered as a
variant of English or variety of English 
It is a variety spoken here in India
And variant and va variety say I think they are
 quite different
Yeah they are just
 Variant 
Variant
Uh so that it's uh 
Variant variant is uh
Variant is 
Is a little different from I think variant 
Uhn 
Varieties of these very necessarily main influences 
I think it differs on which perspective you are trying to say
that no 
No that 
Variant means uh Hinglish 
No I variant in fact it contains
I can yes some sudden
It can
Uhn
It can have some substance of you know that makes
Yeah yeah that's true
 Substance or you know away from the north
 Haan yeah that's one 
But I think it is a very vast topic so unless you define
some range 
Yeah 
Unless you bring certain 
But you
Uh certain certain acceptable you know criteria
A rough 
Uh this Indian English will be too hard and uh you note a
 useless for an Indian English
I think regarding this we have to take other exam with
faculty no you know Sushil Kumar one word will it go
straight uh
 No 
So we pick up a case Indian English in Manipur or
what is called Indian English in Manipur or Manipuri Indian English 
You take up that case 
Even though Manipur is a small state uh most Indians don't
know about Manipur very less it speaks more 
But even though it is a small state tiny state so called tiny
state you have to take up a project like Indian English spoken in
Manipur you will see how many varieties how many different forms 
I do remember Hindi spoken by these people like Kukis once 
already there are friends and colleagues and the Primoga 
even that those two Americans 
I know as far as that two words
 error is displayed
 That then uh 
 Then uh 
See in the in the case of uh Doctor uh you know that
uh or Economics professor Muslim professor they will speak in a
different there use and way you know it's been the way they
speak English is different 
So it's a English academy which is
No the way they speak is Manipur is a in Uttar
Pradesh they speak Manipur uh English is not so different as no
 this
 There is a 
 No 
I think I think there is some differnce 
Then uh
I don't see there is much 
Dr N Loken the elder brother of Dr. Loken 
uh he'll speak in a typical so called intellectual student like
intellectual way 
All this is higher 
What is it?
What is your opinion
Ah they are smaller in one na it will uh 
They are tribals for example uh uh
Yeah that's true
Or professor
Ha literateurs are there 
Henry
Ah 
They speak in English in a different way and again 
even now this Kukis speak English in a different way from Tamkuls or
other Nagas 
I think yeah you may think that I am a Kuki upper
 Yeah 
Ahn
I was just I was just
 That's not a one word difference are 
 so bound to come 
 So 
Then 
 That's what there is the the debate of Indian
English 
Uh you take up even in a tiny state there are so many
varieties
Yeah 
So how many we work at it 
You have to you have to define a range 
Yeah here 
Upto which you can consider certain things 
There is English for part of what I can which is considered as
certain range 
Upto which you can consider certain things
I mean it's sort of fresh or 
 Something a language something a language
 for a suitable language 
Then after area you have to decide define certain things 
acceptable English see
Acceptable norms 
Ahn whether it is Indian English call English Hindi 
just forget that but what you have to define
Uhn 
Then only you can take up
As as you have American started earlier English na
 I think we should although we I think we already have a 
Indian style we have it you know 
We have to have considered a limit na extreme limit
 Yeah 
Yes 
And then whatever falls
Arrange 
Whatever falls 
Within that range
Within within range in that range then on then only
you speak up in Indian English 
Otherwise you continue with that English
I think if we get an influence 
 Haan 
Rush 
With English spoken like
 one word 
Manipuri special dialect all that you have to include
Yeah 
If you want to represent a model of India
Ah that's 
 That's true 
It will become an impossible to yeah do that kind
of
 Yeah 
English that that's spoken here in Indian no 
So it is a it is a vast topic 
I think we can somehow please stop here
Ahn
