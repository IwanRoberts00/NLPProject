Anything which is spoken in India will be Indian English or
""
""
""
No I think English spoken here in the Indian context 
""
""
""
""
And there will be 
Indian English one two three and so on
""
""
There must be different types of Indian Englishes because we
have different varieties of  varieties
means different families of languages spoken here in India
""
""
Or how many of this is the most Indian  of all these Indian
Englishes 
""
""
Yeah 
""
I think 
""
 ask him also
""
""
""
""
""
When was this  this subject of
Indian English 
""
""
I think it started around sixtees  so I feel
""
""
I remember  I forgot
the name of this English teacher  but it is on my tongue
""
""
Yes 
""
""
He brought the book  Common Errors in in
Indian Literature  like
""
""
""
What is that  like
""
""
""
""
""
 that one
""
""
An Arab stays in the big size what you say
""
""
I see 
""
""
But he said 
it's  he he
 recommended some other books for the use
""
""
So what are  what is the what books did you have
""
""
I forgot  I was giving an example
""
""
Okay 
""
""
So that kind of thing with Indian English or  what is
Indian English  so called wrong one in
Indian English 
""
""
No no you cannot say wrong one or right one not  I think
there are some influences and interferences from the mother tongues 
""
""
Oh
""
""
The 
one word 
""
""
""
certain things  were considered wrong
""
""
Wrong  it
""
""
And now even a wrong ones are Indian English  I think
""
""
So whatever English  which is spoken here in India I think
these are all rule governed  because there is no language which is not
rule governed 
""
So in that way you cannot say that Indian English is spoken here in
India is wrong
""
""
But uh  with
the 
""
""
Yeah even we will make one of
""
""
No no I  uh many people in India
speak English 
 that kind of thing
""
""
""
""
""
So how do you 
""
""
And the  past participle to be
used  yeah
 that kind of thing
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That kind of thing 
""
So 
""
""
So that is  that is
""
""
Is it  is it to be categorised as wrong English or Indian
English 
""
""
It can't be categorised as wrong English  it is to be
categorised as Indian English
""
""
But you must remember is 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
You remember your collegues 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And uh his English 
""
So  I
want to say something or the other to you  means
""
""
No I can teach English  uh I don't know what kind of
English is this  there are
Englishes which are spoken by local people which are quite intolerable like
""
""
""
""
""
 if you can consider it as a very very
extreme form of Indian English or 
""
""
I think
""
""
No  you have to you will define a range
""
""
Yeah  what
""
""
 to define your range or to which you can
consider  so I think that
""
""
""
""
""
So even even Indian English  there must be
established Indian English  should be
brought out
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Something as Indian English
""
""
So that will be taken as a variety of Indian English 
""
""
So you say  a song
""
several years back 
English song 
to a rich maiden 
""
So the song goes 
""
Kannada Kannada interspersed with English  English uh English
words broken English words  giving
money
""
""
Without any word without any 
""
""
 I bring in
clouds 
""
So suppose 
many people 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Specially  this is they
are going to speak
""
""
Yes
""
""
So this is cooked up  certains
 it is simple
""
""
I think that  that why
""
""
So  Indian
Kannada English  which can be
considered English 
""
So that we have to decide  what level you
can considered it an English proper  I mean uh proper English or even
proper language 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Because  anything which is
cooked up  even a computer which stores
certain things  jumbled up
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
You mix  and what whatever comes
out 
depending on where it is spoken 
""
""
Yeah  the interference is from mother tongue that they
have  uh as
a mistake  uh they they used to sort of reject the
mistakes 
""
Now these mistakes are normal considered as unwanted element 
they 
of different communities are 
""
So that  this strategy they can
 uh plan
""
""
Yeah I remember uh another  form of very interesting Indian
English which was spoken in J N U where I studied 
""
Uh J N U in the evening  uh
you can visit until seven  and they talk
Marxism  smart
 used to sit together and they used to talk
as 
""
But certain classes among them
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Who had rich fathers or you know with  higher
incomes 
""
""
Yes 
""
Yes this 
""
""
""
""
""
Pardon uh 
""
""
You cannot have to bring the tea here no 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
No you tell him to bring it  you bring it here
""
""
Ah here here one  ah here it is there
""
""
What form of 
""
""
Oh sorry
""
""
 know you should
""
""
""
When I think of two  haan
""
""
""
So I think 
it's  already ten minutes more than ten minutes no
""
""
 another another few lines and this
""
""
Okay
""
""
It will be over 
""
""
Uh
""
""
I was just pacing out wherin
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So there names speak some changes like 
uh uh 
""
You know  wear the jean he brought was impressing you
know
""
""
 uh
""
""
That kind of thing 
""
Then uh  uh you know what what Michael
says  that
kind of  so mixed English
""
""
Yeah got one
""
""
You know we you know what happened when you say something 
 then you continue with English
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So what is it  is it Indian Hindi English or Indian Hindi
English ?
""
""
So  what makes a construction
""
""
And there is something called
""
""
""
""
""
I wanted to ask professor Shastri here something is called
Hinglish 
""
""
Hinglish
""
""
Uhn
""
""
I know 
""
""
Not  Hinglish Hinglish
""
""
Hinglish means 
""
""
H I N
""
""
Yeah I know Hinglish 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Hindi English
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Combined 
""
""
English spoken by you know 
""
""
Hindi speakers 
""
""
Hindi speaking  but of course they won't be speaking these
people 
""
""
""
""
""
Where you know Hinglish  is modified according to their
convenience 
""
""
 uh so where did you come across
this English 
""
""
This comes 
""
""
Hinglish 
isn't it
""
""
""
""
""
Hindi you remember 
""
""
So in English I have come across but  I don't
know
""
""
 I think their argument
influences in Punjabi from  I think nil the other way round there are
some influences of 
""
""
Uhm 
""
But 
""
""
That 
""
""
But there is something 
""
""
Yeah that is also 
""
""
""
""
""
Their way
""
""
I just remember that uh that one
""
""
And we
""
""
I remember the words 
""
""
Yeah another form of  variants of English
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 will be considered as a
variant of English or variety of English 
""
""
It is a variety spoken here in India
""
""
And variant and  I think they are
 quite different
""
""
Yeah  just
""
""
""
""
""
Variant
""
""
Uh so that 
""
""
Variant variant  is uh
""
""
Variant is 
""
""
Is a little different from I think 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Varieties of these 
""
""
I think it differs on which perspective you are trying to say
that no 
""
""
No that 
""
""
Variant means uh 
""
""
No I  in fact it contains
""
""
I can yes some sudden
""
""
It can
""
""
Uhn
""
""
It can have some  of you know that makes
""
""
Yeah  true
""
""
 or you know away from the north
""
""
""
""
""
But I think it is a very vast topic  so unless you define
some range 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Unless you bring certain 
""
""
But you
""
""
Uh  certain certain acceptable you know criteria
""
""
A rough 
""
""
Uh this Indian English will be too hard  and uh you note a
 useless for an Indian English
""
""
I think regarding this we have to take other exam with
faculty  will it go
straight uh
""
""
""
""
""
So we pick up a case  or
what is called Indian English in Manipur or Manipuri Indian English 
""
You take up that case 
""
Even though Manipur is a small state  uh most Indians don't
know about Manipur 
""
But even though it is a small state tiny state  so called tiny
state  spoken in
Manipur 
I do remember 
already there are friends and colleagues 
even that 
""
""
I know  two words
 error is displayed
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See in the in the case of uh  you know that
uh  they will speak in a
different  been the way they
speak English is different 
""
So  a English academy which is
""
""
No the way they speak is Manipur is a  in Uttar
Pradesh  no
 this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think I think there is some differnce 
""
Then uh
""
""
I don't see there is much 
""
""
Dr N 
uh  typical so called intellectual student like
intellectual way 
""
""
All this is higher 
""
""
What is it?
""
What is your opinion
""
""
Ah they are smaller in one 
""
""
They are  uh
""
""
Yeah  true
""
""
Or professor
""
""
Ha literateurs 
""
""
Henry
""
""
Ah 
""
""
They speak in English in a different way 
even now this Kukis speak English in a different way from  or
other Nagas 
""
I think  you may think that I am a Kuki upper
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn
""
""
I was just  I was just
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then 
""
""
 the debate of Indian
English 
""
""
Uh you take up  even in a tiny state there are so many
varieties
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So how many we work at it 
""
You have to 
""
""
Yeah here 
""
""
Upto which you can consider certain things 
""
There is English for part of what I can which is considered as
certain range 
""
Upto which you can consider certain things
""
""
I mean 
""
""
 something a language
""
""
Then after area you have to decide define certain things 
acceptable  English see
""
""
Acceptable norms 
""
""
Ahn 
just forget that but what you have to define
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Then only you can take up
""
""
As as you have American started earlier English  na
""
Indian style 
""
""
We have to have considered a limit na extreme  limit
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And then whatever falls
""
""
Arrange 
""
""
Whatever falls 
""
""
Within that range
""
""
Within within range in that range then  then only
you speak up in Indian English 
""
Otherwise you continue with that English
""
""
I think if we get an influence 
""
""
""
""
""
Rush 
""
""
With English spoken like
""
""
""
""
""
Manipuri special dialect  all that you have to include
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
If you want to represent a model of India
""
""
Ah 
""
""
""
""
""
It will become an impossible to  do that kind
of
""
""
""
""
""
English that 
""
""
So it is a it is a vast topic 
""
I think we can somehow please stop here
""
""
Ahn
