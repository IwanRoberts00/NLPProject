uh  the
former prime minister of India

The uh  city of course has been indeed one professional paradise
 and uh has been the hosting of
uh 
""
Uh we also witnessed the third National Games successfully 
concluded at the start of the year

And uh  start of the Seventh

Uh Just before we uh  we spoke to the
President of the  uh Mr Suresh

The president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India  and uh
he is responsible for the Seventh International Permit Meet here in Pune 
Mr Suresh Kalmadi
""
Mr Kalmadi nervous 
""
""
Not at all 
""
""
Uh tell me  the meet for the first time is being held in
Pune  ?
""
""
Well uh  and
 synthetic tract
""
So we thought uh  should have first
international event 
""
Plus the  at New Delhi
 been asking them to lay a new
track  we can not have a international meet
there 
""
""
Uh  you are also asking uh looking forward to recognition
from the world for the grand 
""
Now  and uh we are wishful and hopeful that you
get it next year 
""
Would you then be holding it here  ?
""
""
Well uh  that will have to be decided by the federation
""
""
Uh  you are aware
that uh  in the
last meeting he had said that  will be extended
to Asia 
where the grand 
""
So then 
lot of us  they
will have to come here 
""
So earn their points point world wise 
""
So that will be 
""
""
And talking of this uh permit meet  what do we have in
store  ?
""
""
Well 
athletic event so far held in India 
""
 the level of competition we will be
seeing here today 
""
We have got over ten  the
competition is going to be so good because  a very good crop of athletes
are here today 
""
You are aware that Carl Lewis and Merlene Ottey are heading the 
list of world champions 
""
We have started this permit meet  not to give so much
competition to Indian 
""
We as a country go more to cricket 
been just watching the match 
""
But I think what is  for
athletes that 
why we get people like 
""
So the youngster in this country look towards Olympic spot 
""
""
And uh 
this as a preparation for  uh Asian
games
""
""
""
""
You see luckily this timed well  uh on
its  the Asian games Hiroshima they are going to get
tremendous competition here  Shiny
Ibrahim Saramma  uh also relay teams will get tremendous
""
""
So it will be very good uh 
where the  standard of the Asian games will not be as high as the standard
you will see here today

hours 
""
""
This Seventh edition of the  is an
inspirational excercise 
""
Bringing these foreign athletes to India  to
give them an exposure  and
running aganist them 
""
These men and women who are  both in
India and abroad 
""
Now 
rarely get a chance to take their to take part against  some of the best
performers in the world 
""
Now this happens  where you have
world champions  and uh some of the best performers
""
""
And the exposure definitely  is helpful
""
And which  with the Asian games
coming around the corner  will certainly help our men
and women  whatever performances
 then probably the same could come at Hiroshima or even
better  because all depending on the morale

""
""
""
""
Very hard chase this 
""
Katherine Maenhout Belgium  in the first position at the
moment 
""
Shiny Wilson in third position

Shiny coming up now let us see what she is going to do now

Oh that looked like big break of Shiny Wilson  let's
""
""
Striding strongly 
second in the world championship  silver medalist in the world
championship 
""
And Shiny going for all she can 
""
 Europeans on European
circuit 
can do it just now 
""
Dukhnova striding back Shiny also coming through  only a little
bit more for a stride 
but she just cannot make it 
""
 the second in the world
championship and 
number two two six Natalia Dukhnova 
""
Second 
""
Normally Shiny never comes up  but it
definitely looks like that she has improved in the finishing business 
""
And the  European circuit has done her well
""
""
Well  the action replay for you I think Shiny
is  Dukhnova
of Belarus

uh 
""
 record holder at the
discus in the world  and the Germans have always dominated this event
""
""
""
They all set for the eight hundred metres  which has
record 
""
Willaim Tanui is  alternating
between the eight hundred and the fifteen hundred metres 
""
 didn't
finally come 
""
Otherwise it would have been a sensational race  between one
the world champion 
""
But we have William Tanui here  interruption
 the best
for the four hundred metres in India 
""
They are  both of these
Indian runners together in three hundred  Avtaar Singh
probably  basically the relay for
India  is very important four by two hundred metres relay and of course
both the women  four by hundred and four by two hundred metres relay
""
""
And just for the statistical minded the meet record  in
the name of Billa Contella of Kenya  one minute forty-five point nine
three 
quite old  Ram Sing one forty-five point seven seven
