<I>
Good afternoon and uh greetings to Doordarshan
 viewers and uh welcome to the Shiv Chhatrapati sport city
 at Balewadi the outskirts of uh Pune 
Uh Pune of course one considers something to a paradise and
uh the speech of course dedicated to the late Rajiv Gandhi the
former prime minister of India on his uh fiftieth uh birthday 
The uh city of course has been indeed one professional paradise
 is uh today labelled as a sport city and uh has been the hosting of
uh the International Marathon over the last ten years 
Uh we also witnessed the third National Games successfully 
concluded at the start of the year 
And uh we're now watching the start of the Seventh
International uh uh Permit Meet here at the Shiv Chhatrapati 
Sport City Complex 
Uh Just before we uh came onto the air we spoke to the
President of the uh Amateur Athletic Federation of India uh Mr Suresh
Kalmadi 
The president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India and uh
he is responsible for the Seventh International Permit Meet here in Pune 
Mr Suresh Kalmadi
Mr Kalmadi nervous 
Not at all fully prepared 
Uh tell me the meet for the first time is being held in
Pune why is that you got it here ?
Well uh Pune has got this beautiful sport city and
 manifold athelitic stadium with uh synthetic tract
So we thought uh this sport city should have first
international event in the form of a permit meet 
Plus the track at Jawaharlal Nehru stadium at New Delhi
 is not up the mark we've been asking them to lay a new
track till they lay a new track we can not have a international meet
there 
Uh you are also asking uh looking forward to recognition
from the world for the grand feat 
Now uh in case and uh we are wishful and hopeful that you
get it next year 
Would you then be holding it here ?
Well uh that will have to be decided by the federation
Uh we are in a run for the grand feat you are aware
that uh Mr Primo Nebolio is the world president in the
last meeting he had said that the grand feat will be extended
to Asia and he has named India and Japan as the next country 
where the grand feat will be held 
So then this time athletic come to India and you see 
lot of us uh champions coming here as part of their routine they
will have to come here 
So earn their points point world wise 
So that will be really good 
And talking of this uh permit meet what do we have in
store ?
Well uh this is uh no doubt the greatest 
athletic event so far held in India 
 We've never had the level of competition we will be
seeing here today 
We have got over ten world champions here and the
competition is going to be so good because a very good crop of athletes
are here today 
You are aware that Carl Lewis and Merlene Ottey are heading the 
list of world champions 
We have started this permit meet not to give so much
competition to Indian but to popularise athletics in the country 
We as a country go more to cricket as if we've 
been just watching the match 
But I think what is needed today two words for
athletes that more attention to be put to athletics that's 
why we get people like Carl Lewis and Merlene Ottey here 
So the youngster in this country look towards Olympic spot 
And uh obviously uh you are also looking at uh 
this as a preparation for the Indian contingent for the uh Asian
games
 That's right 
You see luckily this timed well so the Indian team is uh on
its last lap to the Asian games Hiroshima they are going to get
tremendous competition here especially Bahudar Prasad and Shiny
Ibrahim Saramma Shakti Singh uh also relay teams will get tremendous
 uh competition here today 
So it will be very good uh for them at the Asian games 
where the standard of the Asian games will not be as high as the standard
you will see here today
Mr Kalmadi thank you very much
We wish you the very best and we hope that under your guidance
 Indian athletes continue to grow from stature to stature thank
you very much
Thank you 
Well uh the uh guest of honour uh Shri 
Vidya Charan Shukla the Union Minister for water resources along with uh
 uh Shri Mukul Vasnik the Union Minister for sports and
cultural affairs uh are here 
The festivities would get under way soon 
Uh but uh to uh tell you what scheme store over the next four
hours uh is my colleague commentator John Castro 
This Seventh edition of the I T C international is an
inspirational excercise 
Bringing these foreign athletes to India is basically to
give them an exposure where watching the others in action and
running aganist them will help our own boys and girls 
These men and women who are representing India both in
India and abroad to do better 
Now it's very obvious that Indian athletes 
rarely get a chance to take their to take part against some of the best
performers in the world 
Now this happens in this I T C meet where you have
world champions olympic champions and uh some of the best performers
 in the grand feat circuit 
And the exposure definitely is helpful
And which especially in this exercise with the Asian games
coming around the corner the exposure will certainly help our men
and women to hopefully do better because whatever performances
 we record here then probably the same could come at Hiroshima or even
better because all depending on the morale
Well John just breaking away from you for a movement
These are the uh girls from Dastur High School Pune 
Hundred of them and uh they start the march past 
 They're going to display the rainbow uh the colours
which we all know as VIBGYOR 
As the cheer goes up for a fine display we are marching
 as one would say kadam se kadam milaye jaa 
the band in attendance here is uh from the National Defence Academy 
uh just a few kilometres away from the sports complex 
And uh along with the band from the National Defence Academy uh
is the band of the Maratha light infantry Belgaum 
The band masters uh Subedar Major Sumer Singh and band
master Subedar Major uh Kishan Shetty 
They are playing kadam badhaye ja 
We have a host of dignitories present here 
And I said earlier on the guest of honour the uh
Honourable Minister for water resources uh Shri 
Vidyacharan Shukla along with uh uh Shri Mukul
Vasnik the Union Minister for sports are here 
And this is the march past 
John a little deviation they're marching in a jumbled
formation 
Yeah because uh it's uh just had especially we
have an opening ceremony in say the Asians games or the Olympic
games 
But here more it is a friendly exercise but of course 
not in competition 
That is why it is uh it has been decided here that they
walk uh without the regular marching regimentation that we have
normally 
Well a broad moment for the girls and that's the 
section of the V I P box uh you watch uh the Union Minister for
water resources Shri Vidya Charan Shukala uh along with
Mukul Vasnik the president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India 
 Shri uh Suresh Kalmadi 
The uh G O C M C southern command Lieutenant General Moti Dhar is
also here 
Six from Belarus two from Belgium six from China John
there you are for the first time 
Yes the Chinese are here for the first time and you we
really do not know much about their performances
It is when you ask them something about what they're 
really doing they don't understand our language 
Yes we're certainly uh look for a surprise and
 that's VIBGYOR which goes up for the uh Indian contingent 
This is a big meet for them 
Just a few weeks uh before they depart for the Asian Games in
uh Hiroshima uh P T Usha the darling of the crowd she is there 
 She's going to be running today as well along with uh
 Shiny Wilson and uh 
And of course you can't miss out uh Bahadur Prasad who's
 won laurel's uh for India in the International Circuit 
A proud moment for the girls from Dastur High School Pune a
hundred strong as they march up in unison and uh that goes
to prove that uh we in India are all one as they march together
This Indian team which is here comprises those 
who're going to Hiroshima as well as some of the prominent
youngsters who are in the A A F I camp that's the Amateur
Athletic Federation of India camp those youngsters are getting the
exposure so that uh they also get a chance amongst against these
world champions and it could helpful be helpful 
 to them 
Between John yes uh this is uh the thing in the right
direction isn't it ?
Right you have to give them exposure well as cheer or with
applaud and thankfully are the Indian athlete have had the quite
a good measure of exposure in Europe and elsewhere this season and
hopefully they should uh come with some medals at uh from
Hisroshima like at Beijing where it was all silver and a couple
of bronze 
But uh this time we are expecting better much uh you
also have to be a very realistic about the fact that the Chinese and
the athlete from the Middle East have uh gone away away from us
and uh it is going to be difficult 
John the presence of uh Carl Lewis and uh Merlene Ottey
here is certainly going to be a big inspiration uh not only for the
athlete but uh the thousands of youngsters who have gathered 
To Kipta I mean Kiptanui the uh Moses Kiptanui of
Kenya 
He is the world record holder for the two miles and uh
also for the two thousand metres in one word and he will be
running here shortly this afternoon 
He says my hero is a few words who came to India
 and previously in previous years and he says that in Kenya we
all these old athletes who are greats and greats in their own way 
as ideal which is at one time I used to look to Crieno 
And uh my ideal and uh first to do I'd like to feel
like and today he says everybody in Kenya says we'd like to
be like Moses Kiptanui if he is wearing a new hairstyle then but uh
 you'd like to see him better when he runs 
Well they all trooping in here the youngsters uh 
along with the mothers and I'm sure they are going to be the 
stars of the future 
They are coming here to watch the big stars in action 
 They're going to go back home wondering what they
must do 
And uh we have the president of the Amateur Athletic
Federation of India Mr Suresh Kalmadi now addressing the uh athletes
Well that was uh Mr Suresh Kalmadi the president of the uh
 Amateur Athletic Federation of India 
Uh his words uh to the congregation here at uh the Sports
Complex 
A complex which of course uh is a city by itself with uh
so many beautiful stadium uh which are capable of hosting almost 
all the sports
During the last National Games the last National Games which were
held in uh uh January uh start of the year uh only six of
them were held in uh Bombay 
Mr Mukal Vasnik the Union Minister for sport uh looking at a
vision in the distant future 
Uh he spoke of a four year plan for all the federations of
sports 
And uh this mission would take India from uh strength to
strength as we march on into the 
And uh the national record is in the name of Shakti Singh at
uh sixty-one point seven two 
We are watching the start of the women's three hundred
metres 
Which has two Indians here 
We have Rosa Kutty we got Shiny Wilson 
Now that's the well Shiny Wilson has got about 
a good rate yesterday where you have some good athletes you come to
win here again come to gain gold medal 
 A few words 
Chinese second position at the moment 
But the national record is in the name of Jyoti Sikdar
 at two minutes O one point six zero a beat record in the name of
Yuan Grabbermine of Germany 
 It's very hot chase 
Very hard chase this 
Katherine Maenhout Belgium in the first position at the
moment 
Shiny Wilson in third position 
Shiny coming up now let us see what she is going to do now 
Oh that looked like big break of Shiny Wilson and let's
 see now whether she is going through 
Striding strongly is Natalia Dukhnova she's 
second in the world championship silver medalist in the world
championship 
And Shiny going for all she can 
 She's done better in uh Europeans on European
circuit and it's Shi Shiny 
can do it just now 
Dukhnova striding back Shiny also coming through only a little
bit more for a stride got through the back stride very close 
but she just cannot make it 
 That's Dukhnova Natalia the second in the world
championship and champion here the one with the dark glasses 
number two two six Natalia Dukhnova of Belarus 
Second close second was Shiny Wilson 
Normally Shiny never comes up with such a finish but it
definitely looks like that she has improved in the finishing business 
And the European circuit has done her well
Well that's the action replay for you I think Shiny
is starting a wee bit uh at the bitter end and uh Dukhnova
of Belarus full of experience striding away 
It looked so near for Shiny but uh it wasn't to be as uh
 Natalia Dukhnova of Belarus there she breaks the tape now to win
the women's eight hundred metres final and uh edging out 
Shiny Wilson from India and to complete uh the event uh in third spot
was uh Cydesen Karen of Denmark 
So the teams here uh taking there first medal 
And we're watching the uh prize distribution of the
 women's four hundred metres 
The uh prizes being handed out the medals by the Union
Minister for sports Shri Mukul Vasnik uh to Anja Rooker
of Germany who won with the time of fifty-two point two zero 
Richa Hedid of the United States fifty-two point five eight
takes the silver 
And Bi Ziagun of China coming in third spot uh 
happiness all over her face fifty-two point nine zero 
And uh that certainly makes a very happy picture for uh the
albums of these three athletes posing with uh Shri Mukul
Vasnik the youthful minister for sports 
Remember we are here at uh the Shri Shiv
Chattrapati Sports City in Pune for the seventh addition of the
International Permit Meet 
Held on six earlier occasion in uh New Delhi at the
Jawaharlal Nehru stadium 
And uh it's this is the first time that uh it being
hosted at Pune 
As we move over to the uh men's discus 
A hundred and seventy-one Ajit Bahduria of India 
The crowds on their toes at the far end trying to see the
 finest athletes uh in action 
 That's Ajit Bahduria with the discus 
Jurgen Schultz the world record holder much expected from
him 
And uh these children in colourful clothes just going off your
screen watching uh Jurgen Schultz at the discus 
interruption 
We had a very colourful opening uh today here at Pune
 That's Jurgen Schultz a fine action replay his
uh body coordination 
 That's what has made him uh record holder at the
discus in the world and the Germans have always dominated this event
 interrupton 
They all set for the eight hundred metres which has
record Olympic champion William Tanui in full black 
Willaim Tanui is one great sensational runner alternating
between the eight hundred and the fifteen hundred metres 
 It's unfortunate that Paul Ruto expected here didn't
finally come 
Otherwise it would have been a sensational race between one
the world champion and the other the Olympic champion 
But we have William Tanui here and in the interruption
 here the six uh we have two Indian runners Avtaar Singh the best
for the four hundred metres in India and Jercy Matthew 
They are organised deliberately put put both of these
Indian runners together in three hundred because Avtaar Singh
probably could come in in the relay basically the relay for
India is very important four by two hundred metres relay and of course
both the women four by hundred and four by two hundred metres relay
And just for the statistical minded the meet record in
the name of Billa Contella of Kenya one minute forty-five point nine
three and uh once again surprising John the Indian record still 
quite old Shri Ram Sing one forty-five point seven seven
Yeah they don't make them like Shri Ram
Singh and Milkha Singh these days
