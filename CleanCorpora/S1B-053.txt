The past  uh
bringing the gap between the developed and backward regions in the country
""
""
This budget does not hold on  for
backward state  with the
rest of the country
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah every region 
""
""
""
communication
""
""
Before three we should finish 
""
""
Assam and Bodo  the entire
north eastern region  and
mineral 
""
There are no provisions in the  to combat the
waste 
and tapping the natural resources 
benefit 
""
""
""
""
""
 your party
time is sixty-two minutes 
""
""
And bringing material welfare to them 
""
Assam is a state  where eighty percent of the people live on
agriculture 
""
 where ceiling on land
holding act was passed 
""
""
""
""
""
The maximum amount of land  which an agriculturist can hold
""
""
In the presence of decay  the
areas in possession of  making the land
with farmers  making more and more
farmers marginal 
""
General provision in the budget for improvement of agriculture 
will not help  uh ah will not help the farmers of the state and special
provisions  has to be made
""
Special agriculture in the field in the state it is the team 
one or two words 
""
There are no provisions  no
provisions for irrigation  to make agriculture
""
""
In the field of industry  is the most backward
""
""
The industries in the state  exploitative
character 
""
The British  exploited the natural resources in
the state to their best 
only 
""
Local  in their
attempt  one or two words
""
""
Industrialists operating in Assam exploit the natural wealth 
resources  without
contributing to the welfare of the people 
""
The Industries also do not help  of the
unemployment programme  to employ local people
""
""
They  for industries in the north
eastern region  to the people of
the state  and the region
""
""
local entrepreneur  as part of industries by offering special concession
and in  to enter the
field 
""
There are  for rehabilitation of
the non-employed 
agro-based 
""
They are 
progressive unemployment  and number of announcement being
in medium  by last every year
""
The problem 
""
The use of the state  are straight away
emerging out of 
""
Large numbers of youth  others have taken
recourse to 
""
""
We are going to lose an entire generation 
""
Militancy  have
been  and large numbers of people are
behind the bars under TADA 
""
Development was 
""
The Government has  that strong arm tactics is
not going to help 
""
There should be  the
terrorist  to
ensure economic development 
""
""
B) V M Jadhav 
""
""
You know and everybody knows  that in June nineteen
ninety-one 
economy was totally paralysed 
""
Unprecedent balance of payment crisis was there 
""
International confiderate has been total collapse  and
industrial production was falling  on right thing
""
""
And then  honourable Narasimha Rao taken up the leadership of
this country as a prime minister 
""
And Mr Manmohan Singh  when he became the finance minister of
this country  for such largest
populated country of the world  and he
has brought out the reforms 
""
And we are today 
those reforms 
""
Madam you know  and I also know we talked on the state to state
""
""
You know that our Maharashtra is most agriculturally and
economically advance state 
""
It is not only due to Bombay 
""
We are running about one hundred and ten co- operatives sugar
factories more successfully 
""
We are producing forty percent of the national sugarcane 
""
We are producing the forty percent total of the national cotton 
and then most of the cotton mills and textile mills are concentrated in
Bombay 
""
And if something goes wrong in Bombay  if war started somebody
""
""
This is the wrong policy  please for the one state you adopt
this policy of the decentralisation  of the industries to the rural and
economically backward areas of this country 
""
Unless you do that  they will
never excuse you  one or two
words  has no
meaning 
""
But the main significant thing is that  then important thing is
that the people of this country must get equal benefit of our economic
policies 
""
That should be main concern about the country 
""
I was reading in todays one of the press about the Duncan Agreement
""
""
Government is going to accept the Duncan Agreement 
""
I don't know  fully studied the Duncan
Agreement 
""
But government how they discuss about the Duncan Agreement 
""
What is the Duncan Agreement  ?
""
What it is going to do harm  ?
""
How it will be beneficial to the farmers  ?
""
Farmers are against Madam for  but
the thing is that you please see first what is their economic situation 
""
How much he is getting in his farm  ?
""
Or how much output he is getting  ?
""
We have categorically demanded in this house  this agriculture
commodity should be given the regulatory prices 
""
You  you allow us to
increase the prices of agriculture commodity by the standard move  when
you  but
at one  side you are not allowing to increase the agriculture
""
""
Madam about the modernisation of the industry 
""
So about the modernisation of industry 
""
But I must say that 
 the
National Textile Corporation 
""
See modernisation process is a continous process  and any
industry is coming out  licence are delicenced
but it must be made compulsory that  they must have their own research
laboratory 
""
They must find out their own technology  and they must try to
modernise their industry  as and when required
""
That is very essential
""
Our budget should not be the deficit budget  it must be the
surplus budget 
""
Our export must be much more greater than the 
""
We are given several concession for the import 
""
We are giving several concession for the export also 
""
But we must  at the same time we must see
that 
""
And we must push the export of agriculture commodity 
""
Because in Maharashtra we are trying our level best to export the
mangoes  we are demanding
that you can give us the concession  to export five to fifteen lakhs of
cattle milk 
""
And if we export something 
then we can give better prices to the farmers also 
""
So now the time has come 
we have to give this top priorities for the export of the agricultural
commodity 
""
Madam I did not  in the detail but I wanted
to demand in this house  on the budget
""
development of economically backward region  for Marathwada Vidarbha and
parts of Konkan in Maharashtra 
""
In this very house  in this very house we have
several time demanded  category development board should be
created for the backward regions of  Marathwada Vidharba
and parts of Konkan 
""
Government has never agreed 
""
But at least you must make this situation higher than provision 
""
What is backlog of those region  ?
""
Others is  then when you have to mention this special
financial assistance is given for the development of the economically
backward regions of this country 
""
Another important thing is that  industrialisation of sugar
factory  horticulture
development programme 
""
Whatever demands are from Maharashtra they should be solved within
no time 
""
Creation of proper road communication  conversion of state
highways into national highways  they are demanding this from Maharashtra
for the last so many years 
""
Special financial assitance for irrigation 
""
As the Krishna and Godavari valley projects are not completed 
""
If we could not complete those projects by two thousand AD our plan
will go 
""
So the special financial assistance should be given for the
irrigation project which are to come up in Krishna and Godavari valley 
""
And laying out a special pipeline
""
Now  in this house we have this is the last discussion I am
taking Madam
""
The 
questions and some other uh items  in this house I have said that I did
not take down the LPG pipe line 
coming  and even your
enquiry  said
""
On the same line  we demanded in this house that we must have
some  from Maharashtra
to southern India 
""
It must go from the Maharashtra  then
Karnataka  so like this the several
pipelines which can carry the Bombay High  inspite of
clearing up the gas 
per year
""
You please have the another pipeline and carry out the gas in the
southern India 
""
So that our  farmers of the southern India will be benefitted
""
With this few lines I I suppose this so 
and thank you very much for
