 A) JARACHARAN M 
The past much sounded programme of bringing uh
bringing the gap between the developed and backward regions in the country
This budget does not hold on to the hope for
backward state like Assam for bringing the region at par with the
rest of the country
 One or two words 
Yeah every region should be considered 
 One or two words industry 
communication
Before three we should finish 
Assam and Bodo one or two words land the entire
north eastern region is full of untapped natural resources and
mineral 
There are no provisions in the budget to combat the
waste to find out for the purpose of finding out 
and tapping the natural resources for the beneficial 
benefit of the people 
 As to a few words 
 No no finance a few words your party
time is sixty-two minutes 
And bringing material welfare to them 
Assam is a state where eighty percent of the people live on
agriculture 
 Assam perhaps was the first state where ceiling on land
holding act was passed in the mid fifties 
 A few words 
The maximum amount of land which an agriculturist can hold
 is fifty bighas 
In the presence of decay and natural division of family the
areas in possession of farmers are diminishing making the land
with farmers progressively uneconomic making more and more
farmers marginal and landless 
General provision in the budget for improvement of agriculture 
will not help uh ah will not help the farmers of the state and special
provisions uh for making industrial planning has to be made
Special agriculture in the field in the state it is the team 
one or two words 
There are no provisions of mechanical agriculture no
provisions for irrigation and other two word to make agriculture
 one word economically viable 
In the field of industry my state is the most backward
The industries in the state has not taste its exploitative
character 
The British uh colonial exploited the natural resources in
the state to their best and the Indian which is that has taken over 
only saves exploitative assault 
Local enterpreneur are being discouraged in their
attempt to enter the field and there are one or two words
 incentives to them not to try healthy one or two words 
Industrialists operating in Assam exploit the natural wealth 
resources all profit take this out of the state without
contributing to the welfare of the people 
The Industries also do not help in the solution of the
unemployment programme as they are reluctant to employ local people
They one or two words for industries in the north
eastern region would not confirm anybody with to the people of
the state and the region
 One or two words provisions are made to encourage 
local entrepreneur as part of industries by offering special concession
and in one or two words for encouraging them to enter the
field 
There are no provisions in the budget for rehabilitation of
the non-employed and one or two words by starting 
agro-based heavy industry 
They are uh no provisions for meeting to the 
progressive unemployment programme and number of announcement being
in medium and it is uh increasing by last every year
The problem is a real one and a serious one 
The use of the state discoverings on are straight away
emerging out of uh deep sense of deprivation 
Large numbers of youth have taken up arms others have taken
recourse to extortion one word as national a few words 
We are going to lose an entire generation 
Militancy and militarian para military forces have
been a permanent picture in the state and large numbers of people are
behind the bars under TADA 
Development was uh kept to a standstill for years 
The Government has to realise that strong arm tactics is
not going to help 
There should be special provision for removal of the
terrorist and the development of the state and special measure to
ensure economic development should be started 
 
B) V M Jadhav 
You know and everybody knows that in June nineteen
ninety-one when our government has come into power that time 
economy was totally paralysed 
Unprecedent balance of payment crisis was there 
International confiderate has been total collapse and
industrial production was falling and inflation was on right thing
And then honourable Narasimha Rao taken up the leadership of
this country as a prime minister 
And Mr Manmohan Singh when he became the finance minister of
this country then whatever economically beneficial for such largest
populated country of the world he has sort out properly and he
has brought out the reforms 
And we are today we are getting the fruits of for 
those reforms 
Madam you know and I also know we talked on the state to state
You know that our Maharashtra is most agriculturally and
economically advance state 
It is not only due to Bombay 
We are running about one hundred and ten co- operatives sugar
factories more successfully 
We are producing forty percent of the national sugarcane 
We are producing the forty percent total of the national cotton 
and then most of the cotton mills and textile mills are concentrated in
Bombay 
And if something goes wrong in Bombay if war started somebody
 from Bombay so total economy will be collapsed 
This is the wrong policy please for the one state you adopt
this policy of the decentralisation of the industries to the rural and
economically backward areas of this country 
Unless you do that our countrymen our people they will
never excuse you either BJP will be one or two
words or any other party will be one or two words has no
meaning it is totally insignificant 
But the main significant thing is that then important thing is
that the people of this country must get equal benefit of our economic
policies that is the main concern 
That should be main concern about the country 
I was reading in todays one of the press about the Duncan Agreement
Government is going to accept the Duncan Agreement 
I don't know I have not fully studied the Duncan
Agreement 
But government how they discuss about the Duncan Agreement 
What is the Duncan Agreement ?
What it is going to do harm to the farmers ?
How it will be beneficial to the farmers ?
Farmers are against Madam for taxing the agriculturists but
the thing is that you please see first what is their economic situation 
How much he is getting in his farm ?
Or how much output he is getting ?
We have categorically demanded in this house this agriculture
commodity should be given the regulatory prices 
You one or two words industry you allow us to
increase the prices of agriculture commodity by the standard move when
you you you you just gather sympathy to pretend but do not hike but
at one at one side you are not allowing to increase the agriculture
 pro prices of agriculture commodity 
Madam about the modernisation of the industry 
So about the modernisation of industry much help needed 
But I must say that as I have stated yesterday also 
 wh while discussing about the NTC the
National Textile Corporation 
See modernisation process is a continous process and any
industry is coming out any licence is given licence are delicenced
but it must be made compulsory that they must have their own research
laboratory 
They must find out their own technology and they must try to
modernise their industry as and when required
That is very essential
Our budget should not be the deficit budget it must be the
surplus budget 
Our export must be much more greater than the import 
We are given several concession for the import 
We are giving several concession for the export also 
But we must do all this at the same time we must see
that what we are exporting 
And we must push the export of agriculture commodity 
Because in Maharashtra we are trying our level best to export the
mangoes to export the grapes to export the we are demanding
that you can give us the concession to export five to fifteen lakhs of
cattle milk 
And if we export something and we get this foreign exchange 
then we can give better prices to the farmers also 
So now the time has come we are not to think twice that 
we have to give this top priorities for the export of the agricultural
commodity 
Madam I did not I will not go uh in the detail but I wanted
to demand in this house as the discussion is going on on the budget
 so that special financial provisions have to be made for the 
development of economically backward region for Marathwada Vidarbha and
parts of Konkan in Maharashtra 
In this very house I'm in this very house we have
several time demanded that uh category development board should be
created for the backward regions of Maharashtra Marathwada Vidharba
and parts of Konkan 
Government has never agreed 
But at least you must make this situation higher than provision 
What is backlog of those region ?
Others is if then when you have to mention this special
financial assistance is given for the development of the economically
backward regions of this country 
Another important thing is that industrialisation of sugar
factory spinning mills food processing industries horticulture
development programme 
Whatever demands are from Maharashtra they should be solved within
no time 
Creation of proper road communication conversion of state
highways into national highways they are demanding this from Maharashtra
for the last so many years 
Special financial assitance for irrigation 
As the Krishna and Godavari valley projects are not completed 
If we could not complete those projects by two thousand AD our plan
will go and whole Maharashtra will not get any water 
So the special financial assistance should be given for the
irrigation project which are to come up in Krishna and Godavari valley 
And laying out a special pipeline
Now in this house we have this is the last discussion I am
taking Madam
The uhm while discussing the one or two words 
questions and some other uh items in this house I have said that I did
not take down the LPG pipe line which is co 
coming from Bombay High to the Jagdishpur and even your
enquiry a few words said
On the same line we demanded in this house that we must have
some a pipe line which can carry the Bombay High gas from Maharashtra
to southern India 
It must go from the Maharashtra Vidarbha Marathwada then
Karnataka then Andhra then Tamil Nadu so like this the several
pipelines which can carry the Bombay High surplus gas inspite of
clearing up the gas worth upto fourteen hundred crores 
per year
You please have the another pipeline and carry out the gas in the
southern India so that the farmers there two words 
So that our farmers of the southern India will be benefitted
With this few lines I I suppose this so one or two words 
and thank you very much for one word
