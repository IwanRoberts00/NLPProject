Justice Dinshaw Mehta  honourable
""
""
Academic Councils  members of
""
who are graduating today  ladies and gentleman
""
""
I am deeply thankful for the invitation extended to me by the
""
this great University  I was very happy to hear
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 lived the better part of my life in Bombay where I
""
""
My most favourite hill stations are Matheran and Mahabaleshwar 
""
""
""
""
Marathi 
""
""
my hero 
""
""
and immensely enjoyed the visits to Pratapgarh fort  from Maharashtra we
""
""
Pratapgarh fort and its surroundings  which never failed to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I had my own race horses 
applause 
""
""
""
Now may I extend before I go further my congratulations my hearty
congratulations  to those students who are graduating
out today 
""
I have no doubt  and
""
""
""
Friends I believe  belongs to the young
""
""
The future of India 
""
I have great faith in the youth of India 
""
Youth  and which is
not being corrupted by the curse of consumerism  or the malady of
""
""
""
""
""
concerned 
""
""
pride when I go abroad 
""
""
and respect for human rights  by and large are preserved and respected in
our country 
""
And I think that is something about which every Indian  should
""
""
The topic of my address is  The role of lawyers and the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
control itself 
""
""
obliging 
""
The great difficulty mentioned by Madison confronts our country in
""
decencies to all persons  and the
independence of the judiciary 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
constitutional edifice 
""
""
""
""
""
And the essence of independence of judges is  there is
""
""
""
""
""
What kind of persons did our founding fathers visualised  for
""
""
""
 but should be
""
integrity 
""
""
government 
""
Now in order to ensure the independence of the  higher judiciary
""
years in the case of High Court judge  and sixty-five years in the case
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
executive  but only by a procedure provided in the Constitution which is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
government 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is my view  and High Court
""
appointed to any body or tribunal  which is subordinate to the High Court
""
""
It is an unseemly sight  to witness legal challenges to the
""
Court 
""
""
 today they don't even get full
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
experience 
""
""
In most countries following the common law tradition  the usual
""
""
""
""
""
But the foremost quality required  in deciding constitutional
issues is  to the philosophy of our
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Australia  another developing country
""
""
It is important to have exposure  to judgements of national
""
international tribunals  to the
""
""
But ultimately we have to work out our own constitutional salvation
""
""
of himself or herself 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
judge 
""
Let us be realistic  judges like you and me are human beings
 to completely shed their predilections
""
""
""
""
""
process 
""
Our great Chief Justice Patanjali Shastri frankly acknowledged 
""
""
""
""
""
not meant only for the people  but for all
""
""
""
read their preferences into statutory and constitutional provision 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All reflects of social and moral philosophy of these judges 
""
Strong views for the rights of labour certainly influenced the
decisions of Justice Gajendragadkar 
""
Justice D. A.  that landlords
""
solicitude was transparent in his judgements 
""
""
majority of cases  have not acted as knight-errants
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
By and large  judges do make a conscientious effort to
""
""
If a law prohibiting consumption of alcohol is challenged  the
""
legislation 
""
And it cannot invalidate the law because in its opinion  the
evil of drink cannot be effectively tackled by legislation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 of the court striking down the
""
""
""
much  the
""
""
""
They said it is not for the Supreme Court to go into that  they
""
""
provision 
""
""
nationalisation of banks was effectuated 
""
""
""
preventive detention of certain communists 
""
Now mind you 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
judgement 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Although it is necessary to remove certain view you hear this very
""
""
""
misconception  of the judiciary in our constitutional
""
""
One of the essential features of our Constitution is division of
""
""
""
""
""
""
A central feature of our Constitution  flowing from the division
""
""
""
power 
""
Moreover the limits of power cannot be determined by the limited
""
""
""
and prescribes limitations of the powers of Parliament the State legislature
""
umpire  to resolve the
inevitable disputes over the boundaries of the constitutional power  which
""
""
And please remember  that our Constitution has guaranteed
certain fundamental rights  that any law
""
""
""
of Parliament and the State legislatures and the executive  and the
