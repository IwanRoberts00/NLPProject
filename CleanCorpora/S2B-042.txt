Justice Dinshaw Mehta  honourable
Chancellor of the University  Vice- Chancellor
Professor Dhanagare  and
Academic Councils  members of
the senate  young students of the university
who are graduating today  ladies and gentleman
""
""
I am deeply thankful for the invitation extended to me by the
Shivaji University  Annual Convocation of
this great University  I was very happy to hear
 when the Vice- Chancellor presented his report both in Marathi and in
English 
""
I consider it a previlege  and feel greatly honoured for the
invitation to give the Convocation Address 
""
And let me tell you  I think it a greater previlege than the
""
""
""
I am no stranger to Maharashtra 
""
 lived the better part of my life in Bombay where I
still have a home 
""
My most favourite hill stations are Matheran and Mahabaleshwar 
""
In Mahabaleshwar I have a country home 
""
I am in every sense a Maharashtranian  a few words in
Marathi 
""
From my younger days Shivaji  has been
my hero 
""
And I keenly  and I keenly look forward to
and immensely enjoyed the visits to Pratapgarh fort  from Maharashtra we
used to go 
""
Pratapgarh fort and its surroundings  which never failed to
inspire me  the wise statesmanship
""
""
I repeat  Chhatrapati
Shivaji Maharaj  in
this present age 
""
I have a certain association at Kolhapur 
""
 of Kolhapur had his racing horses in uh
""
""
I had my own race horses 
applause 
""
So Kolhapur has this association to hang 
""
Now may I extend before I go further my congratulations my hearty
congratulations  to those students who are graduating
out today 
""
I have no doubt  and
the traditions  will serve them
well 
""
Friends I believe  belongs to the young
""
""
The future of India 
""
I have great faith in the youth of India 
""
Youth  and which is
not being corrupted by the curse of consumerism  or the malady of
materialism 
""
Preservation of democracy and democratic values  and protection
and promotion of human rights  are matters with which everyone of us not
merely lawyers and judges and journalists  everyone of us is or should be
concerned 
""
It is the legitimate pride of every Indian  and I feel that
pride when I go abroad 
and conventions  turmoils and tribulations
""
and respect for human rights  by and large are preserved and respected in
our country 
""
And I think that is something about which every Indian  should
feel proud of 
""
The topic of my address is  The role of lawyers and the
judiciary in upholding the constitution democracy and human rights 
""
""
Now the problems  of orderly
government were perceptively discerned about two centuries ago by Madison
""
""
He stated  In
framing a government 
the great difficulty lies in this  you must first enable the government
to control the governed  and in the next place oblige the government to
control itself 
""
Over the years experiences demonstrated that governments are not
obliging 
""
The great difficulty mentioned by Madison confronts our country in
a large measure  as we try to ensure fundamental freedoms and elementary
decencies to all persons  and the
independence of the judiciary 
""
Despite the  and a multitude
of deficiencies which plague the Indian legal system 
but also heartening  that the public still retains confidence in the
judiciary 
""
It is to the judiciary that the citizens turn for protection from
legislative excesses  and for vindication of his
or her rights against the State 
""
An independant judiciary is one of the pillars  of our
constitutional edifice 
""
It is a constitutional  and a moral imperative for the
protection of human rights of the citizens  for maintenance of the rule
of law 
""
And the essence of independence of judges is  there is
adjudication of disputes between citizens  and between citizens and the
State  judges must act
impartially 
emanating from any source 
""
What kind of persons did our founding fathers visualised  for
the high judicial office?
""
Pandit Nehru spoke for all of them when he said  and I quote
 but should be
acknowledged  and of the highest
integrity 
""
And if necessary  people who can stand up against the executive
government 
""
Now in order to ensure the independence of the  higher judiciary
 sixty-two
years in the case of High Court judge  and sixty-five years in the case
of a Supreme Court judge 
""
Frankly I have not been able to understand this sixty-two and
sixty-five 
""
I don't think there is anything in the High Court  wherby at
sixty-two the judge become  and at sixty-five the Supreme
Court judges still go on 
""
Judges  at the pleasure of the
executive  but only by a procedure provided in the Constitution which is
popularly known 
""
Remuneration of the judges is guaranteed by the constitution cannot
be altered by the government of the day  except by constitutional
amendment 
""
So these are the main bulwarks  to insulate judges from
executive pressure  and to relieve them from being dependent on the
government 
""
But executive  influences operate in a variety of subtle ways
""
""
For example the prospect of appointment after retirement  to
some statutory body  and sometimes the
prospect 
""
It is my view  and High Court
judges after retirement  nor
appointed to any body or tribunal  which is subordinate to the High Court
or the Supreme Court 
""
It is an unseemly sight  to witness legal challenges to the
orders of former Supreme Court judges  in the High Court or in the Supreme
Court 
""
The proper course is to give full pension to judges on retirement
 today they don't even get full
pension 
""
And to avail of their services in national interest  for
example heading a commission of enquiry  in a matter of vital national
importance 
""
It is also my view  that the present retirement age of the High
Court and Supreme Court judges  so that the
experience 
rather than lose them 
""
In most countries following the common law tradition  the usual
retirement age is seventy years 
""
Friends I do not desire to list  all the qualities a judge
should possess 
""
But the foremost quality required  in deciding constitutional
issues is  to the philosophy of our
 and
admirably encapsulated in the Preamble  and amplified in the chapter on
 which
taken together  the core and conscience of our Constitution
""
""
We may and should  from judgements of
the courts in the United Kingdom 
Australia  another developing country
""
""
It is important to have exposure  to judgements of national
courts of other country  as also the judgements of regional and
international tribunals  to the
solution of problems 
""
But ultimately we have to work out our own constitutional salvation
in the light of our historical background 
independence is  judge must be independent
of himself or herself 
""
In other words in deciding cases the judges should consciously
avoid 
""
It is a difficult task 
""
Have judges maintained  the cold neutrality of an impartial
judge 
""
Let us be realistic  judges like you and me are human beings
 to completely shed their predilections
and preconceptions 
""
The individual tone of the mind  the colour of past experience
 the socio-economic
background of the judge  in the decision making
process 
""
Our great Chief Justice Patanjali Shastri frankly acknowledged 
that  that the so called social philosophy and
the scale of values of the judges 
""
""
At the same time he recognised  The constitution is
not meant only for the people  but for all
""
""
Now there have been occasions  when judges have
read their preferences into statutory and constitutional provision 
""
For example 
declaring gambling as an immoral trade  beyond the pale of constitutional
protection 
""
Justice  view that certain advertisements for
sexual disorders were not protected by the fundamental rights of free speech
""
""
And Justice  I have never
understood that  Lover
""
""
All reflects of social and moral philosophy of these judges 
""
Strong views for the rights of labour certainly influenced the
decisions of Justice Gajendragadkar 
""
Justice D. A.  that landlords
were a rapacious lots  and all tenants deserved the courts utmost
solicitude was transparent in his judgements 
""
But  that in the overwhelming
majority of cases  have not acted as knight-errants
""
""
Cases are decided as if the parties before them were anonymous 
and the issues are legal and constitutional 
""
Judges as a rule  do not intentionally take a view against their
conscience or their oath  nor do they take any cue from the sentiments of
the ruling party 
""
By and large  judges do make a conscientious effort to
neutralise their personal beliefs 
""
If a law prohibiting consumption of alcohol is challenged  the
court is not concerned with the wisdom of the policy underlying the
legislation 
""
And it cannot invalidate the law because in its opinion  the
evil of drink cannot be effectively tackled by legislation 
""
Again when legislation involving nationalisation of road transport
 the individual notions of
the Justices over the policy of nationalisation are irrelevant  in
deciding whether there has been  breach of any constitutional provision
""
""
The decision of the Supreme Court in the bank nationalisation case
 of the court striking down the
legislation because of its disapproval of the policy underlying it 
""
I am afraid what is overlooked is  in the criticism of this
much  the
basic and formidable argument  that nationalisation of banks was not in
the public interest 
""
They said it is not for the Supreme Court to go into that  they
upheld that 
did not provide compensation as required under the then  constitutional
provision 
""
Consequence was  and
nationalisation of banks was effectuated 
""
The general judicial attitude  is aptly and correctly summed up
 in a case of
preventive detention of certain communists 
""
Now mind you 
quashed the orders of detention of the communists 
""
But the statement which I want to read in which I  which I would
like to read is this  It is
perhaps ironical  that I should struggle to oppose this freedoms in
favour of a class of person  and if
the list of their activities furnished to us is a true guide  would be
the first to destroy them if they but had the power 
""
But I cannot allow  to sway my
judgement 
""
Now let me come to another subject 
""
Is there any antithesis between democracy  and an independent
judiciary? 
""
Is judicial review-on undemocratic? 
""
Does judicial invalidation of laws thwart the will of the people?
""
""
Although it is necessary to remove certain view you hear this very
often 
""
I think  to remove certain
misconception  of the judiciary in our constitutional
scheme 
""
One of the essential features of our Constitution is division of
power  between different institutions namely the three wings of the State
""
""
The Parliament and the State legislature  the Executive and the
Judiciary 
""
A central feature of our Constitution  flowing from the division
of powers is 
""
Consequently no authority or branch of the State can have absolute
power 
""
Moreover the limits of power cannot be determined by the limited
power itself 
""
Since our Constitution divides power between different organs 
and prescribes limitations of the powers of Parliament the State legislature
and the Executive  it is imperative that there should be an impartial
umpire  to resolve the
inevitable disputes over the boundaries of the constitutional power  which
arise in the process of government 
""
And please remember  that our Constitution has guaranteed
certain fundamental rights  that any law
or executive action which abridges any fundamental right is void 
""
The fundamental rights constitute a limitation  on the powers
of Parliament and the State legislatures and the executive  and the
question whether any legislation  or executive action is violative of any
fundamental right
