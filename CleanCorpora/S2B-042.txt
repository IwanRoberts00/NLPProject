I am deeply thankful for the invitation extended to me by the
Shivaji University to address the thirty-fifth Annual Convocation of
this great University whose achievements I was very happy to hear
 when the Vice- Chancellor presented his report both in Marathi and in
English 
I consider it a previlege and feel greatly honoured for the
invitation to give the Convocation Address 
And let me tell you I think it a greater previlege than the
 Padmavibhusan which you may here not be concerned 
 laughter 
I am no stranger to Maharashtra 
 I've lived the better part of my life in Bombay where I
still have a home 
My most favourite hill stations are Matheran and Mahabaleshwar 
In Mahabaleshwar I have a country home 
I am in every sense a Maharashtranian a few words in
Marathi laughter a few words in Marathi 
From my younger days Shivaji Maharaj has been
my hero 
And I keenly applause and I keenly look forward to
and immensely enjoyed the visits to Pratapgarh fort from Maharashtra we
used to go Mahabaleshwar 
Pratapgarh fort and its surroundings which never failed to
inspire me and remind me of the brave deeds the wise statesmanship
 and the spirit of tolerance 
I repeat the spirit of tolerance of Chhatrapati
Shivaji Maharaj which should guide us and inspire us all in
this present age 
I have a certain association at Kolhapur 
 Maharaja of Kolhapur had his racing horses in uh
 he used to race in Bombay 
I had my own race horses and Pandu Khade was my Jockey 
applause 
So Kolhapur has this association to hang 
Now may I extend before I go further my congratulations my hearty
congratulations and best wishes to those students who are graduating
out today from the halls of these great university 
I have no doubt that the training they have received and
the traditions they have imbibed in this university will serve them
well in facing the challenges of life hereafter 
Friends I believe that the future belongs to the young
The future of India is in the youth of India 
I have great faith in the youth of India 
Youth which has ideals which has vision and which is
not being corrupted by the curse of consumerism or the malady of
materialism 
Preservation of democracy and democratic values and protection
and promotion of human rights are matters with which everyone of us not
merely lawyers and judges and journalists everyone of us is or should be
concerned 
It is the legitimate pride of every Indian and I feel that
pride when I go abroad and an uh attend international conferences 
and conventions that despite the trials turmoils and tribulations
 which our nation has undergone democracy the rule of law 
and respect for human rights by and large are preserved and respected in
our country 
And I think that is something about which every Indian should
feel proud of 
The topic of my address is The role of lawyers and the
judiciary in upholding the constitution democracy and human rights 
Now the problems the perennial problem of orderly
government were perceptively discerned about two centuries ago by Madison
 who was one of the founding fathers of the American Constitution 
He stated in the Federalist and I quote In
framing a government which is to be administered by men over men 
the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government
to control the governed and in the next place oblige the government to
control itself 
Over the years experiences demonstrated that governments are not
obliging and do not control themselves 
The great difficulty mentioned by Madison confronts our country in
a large measure as we try to ensure fundamental freedoms and elementary
decencies to all persons whilst respecting the rule of law and the
independence of the judiciary 
Despite the law's horrendous delays and a multitude
of deficiencies which plague the Indian legal system it is curious 
but also heartening that the public still retains confidence in the
judiciary 
It is to the judiciary that the citizens turn for protection from
legislative excesses and executive abuses and for vindication of his
or her rights against the State 
An independant judiciary is one of the pillars of our
constitutional edifice and is indispensible to a democracy 
It is a constitutional and a moral imperative for the
protection of human rights of the citizens for maintenance of the rule
of law and for preservation of democratic values 
And the essence of independence of judges is there is
adjudication of disputes between citizens and between citizens and the
State and the State is the biggest litigant today judges must act
impartially and be free from pressure or influence of any kind 
emanating from any source 
What kind of persons did our founding fathers visualised for
the high judicial office?
Pandit Nehru spoke for all of them when he said and I quote
 Judges should be not only first rate but should be
acknowledged to be first rate in the country and of the highest
integrity 
And if necessary people who can stand up against the executive
government and whoever may come in their way 
Now in order to ensure the independence of the higher judiciary
 our Constitution provides for security of tenure namely sixty-two
years in the case of High Court judge and sixty-five years in the case
of a Supreme Court judge 
Frankly I have not been able to understand this sixty-two and
sixty-five 
I don't think there is anything in the High Court wherby at
sixty-two the judge become one word and at sixty-five the Supreme
Court judges still go on but that's another thing 
Judges as you know cannot be removed at the pleasure of the
executive but only by a procedure provided in the Constitution which is
popularly known or called the process of impeachment 
Remuneration of the judges is guaranteed by the constitution cannot
be altered by the government of the day except by constitutional
amendment 
So these are the main bulwarks to insulate judges from
executive pressure and to relieve them from being dependent on the
government 
But executive influences operate in a variety of subtle ways
For example the prospect of appointment after retirement to
some statutory body or council or commission and sometimes the
prospect of the office of the governor 
It is my view that the Supreme Court and High Court
judges after retirement should not be given any assignment nor
appointed to any body or tribunal which is subordinate to the High Court
or the Supreme Court 
It is an unseemly sight to witness legal challenges to the
orders of former Supreme Court judges in the High Court or in the Supreme
Court 
The proper course is to give full pension to judges on retirement
 and to avail of their services today they don't even get full
pension they get only half pension 
And to avail of their services in national interest for
example heading a commission of enquiry in a matter of vital national
importance as and when the occasion arises 
It is also my view that the present retirement age of the High
Court and Supreme Court judges needs to be increased so that the
experience and abilities of the serving judges may be utilised 
rather than lose them at the early age of sixty-two and sixty-five 
In most countries following the common law tradition the usual
retirement age is seventy years 
Friends I do not desire to list all the qualities a judge
should possess 
But the foremost quality required in deciding constitutional
issues is that the judge must be attuned to the philosophy of our
 philosophy of our constitution which is succinctly and
admirably encapsulated in the Preamble and amplified in the chapter on
 Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles which
taken together constitute the core and conscience of our Constitution
We may and should should seek lights from judgements of
the courts in the United Kingdom in the United States Canada 
Australia New Zealand South Africa another developing country
It is important to have exposure to judgements of national
courts of other country as also the judgements of regional and
international tribunals and understand their approach to the
solution of problems specially in the field of human rights 
But ultimately we have to work out our own constitutional salvation
in the light of our historical background recording broken 
independence is that the judge must judge must be independent
of himself or herself 
In other words in deciding cases the judges should consciously
avoid being influenced by the preconceived notions 
It is a difficult task 
Have judges maintained the cold neutrality of an impartial
judge as was Edmund Burke's perception? 
Let us be realistic judges like you and me are human beings
 cannot expect them overnight to completely shed their predilections
and preconceptions 
The individual tone of the mind the colour of past experience
 the character and variety of interests the socio-economic
background of the judge inevitably play a role in the decision making
process 
Our great Chief Justice Patanjali Shastri frankly acknowledged 
that It is inevitable that the so called social philosophy and
the scale of values of the judges should play an important part 
At the same time he recognised that The constitution is
not meant only for the people of their way of thinking but for all
 
Now there have been occasions no doubts when judges have
read their preferences into statutory and constitutional provision 
For example the judgement of Chief Justice S. R. Das 
declaring gambling as an immoral trade beyond the pale of constitutional
protection 
Justice Kapur's view that certain advertisements for
sexual disorders were not protected by the fundamental rights of free speech
And Justice Hidayatullah's decision I have never
understood that that Lady Chatterley's Lover
 was obscene 
All reflects of social and moral philosophy of these judges 
Strong views for the rights of labour certainly influenced the
decisions of Justice Gajendragadkar in the field of industrial law 
Justice D. A. Desa's inveterate belief that landlords
were a rapacious lots and all tenants deserved the courts utmost
solicitude was transparent in his judgements 
But it can be safely affirmed that in the overwhelming
majority of cases judges in India have not acted as knight-errants
 on white chargers in quest of their individual notions of justice 
Cases are decided as if the parties before them were anonymous 
and the issues are legal and constitutional 
Judges as a rule do not intentionally take a view against their
conscience or their oath nor do they take any cue from the sentiments of
the ruling party 
By and large judges do make a conscientious effort to
neutralise their personal beliefs and predilections 
If a law prohibiting consumption of alcohol is challenged the
court is not concerned with the wisdom of the policy underlying the
legislation 
And it cannot invalidate the law because in its opinion the
evil of drink cannot be effectively tackled by legislation 
Again when legislation involving nationalisation of road transport
 is challenged in fact was challenged the individual notions of
the Justices over the policy of nationalisation are irrelevant in
deciding whether there has been breach of any constitutional provision
The decision of the Supreme Court in the bank nationalisation case
 is frequently cited as an instance of the court striking down the
legislation because of its disapproval of the policy underlying it 
I am afraid what is overlooked is in the criticism of this
much maligned judgement is that the Supreme Court rejected the
basic and formidable argument that nationalisation of banks was not in
the public interest 
They said it is not for the Supreme Court to go into that they
upheld that but court ruled that certain provisions of the Act 
did not provide compensation as required under the then constitutional
provision 
Consequence was that these provisions were amended and
nationalisation of banks was effectuated 
The general judicial attitude is aptly and correctly summed up
 in the classic statement of Justice Vivian Bose in a case of
preventive detention of certain communists 
Now mind you he gave a dissenting judgement in which he 
quashed the orders of detention of the communists 
But the statement which I want to read in which I which I would
like to read is this and this was Justice Bose then It is
perhaps ironical that I should struggle to oppose this freedoms in
favour of a class of person who if rumour is to be accredited and if
the list of their activities furnished to us is a true guide would be
the first to destroy them if they but had the power 
But I cannot allow personal predilections to sway my
judgement of the Constitution 
Now let me come to another subject 
Is there any antithesis between democracy and an independent
judiciary? 
Is judicial review-on undemocratic? 
Does judicial invalidation of laws thwart the will of the people?
Although it is necessary to remove certain view you hear this very
often 
I think it's necessary to remove certain
misconception about the role of the judiciary in our constitutional
scheme 
One of the essential features of our Constitution is division of
power between different institutions namely the three wings of the State
The Parliament and the State legislature the Executive and the
Judiciary 
A central feature of our Constitution flowing from the division
of powers is that of a limited government 
Consequently no authority or branch of the State can have absolute
power 
Moreover the limits of power cannot be determined by the limited
power itself 
Since our Constitution divides power between different organs 
and prescribes limitations of the powers of Parliament the State legislature
and the Executive it is imperative that there should be an impartial
umpire in the shape of an independent judiciary to resolve the
inevitable disputes over the boundaries of the constitutional power which
arise in the process of government 
And please remember that our Constitution has guaranteed
certain fundamental rights and has expressly provided that any law
or executive action which abridges any fundamental right is void 
The fundamental rights constitute a limitation on the powers
of Parliament and the State legislatures and the executive and the
question whether any legislation or executive action is violative of any
fundamental right has to be decided by some independent body
