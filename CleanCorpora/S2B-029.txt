In the last programme  four basic consumer
rights  right to choose
""
""
In this programme 
consumers'  of all
consumer rights 
""
Now  where wide range
of goods and services  in
relation to health hazard 
""
Take a small item 
""
If the drinking water is not wholesome and potable  and free
from germs and bacteria  run
into 
""
We had the situation last year in Ahmedabad  where three hundred
and fifty people died 
""
Take uh 
""
We do not realise but  the poor or unsafe quality
of detergent  and it also
affects 
""
Now  where all
the passengers flying by the plane 
""
Or take the  running out of the hazardous
chemical industry 
""
The  of the Bhopal gas tragedy
""
 the leak of M
I S 
""
Now therefore in this context  as
to how the consumers  both their health
""
""
Now  we should look
at some of the other items of domestic or day to day use 
""
Take for example domestic gas cylinder 
""
There are cases where  and
resulting into 
the babes in their arms 
""
Take other areas  Domestic electrical appliances
""
""
These are of day to day use  and there are cases of
electrocution  person gets a
shock 
""
Now  uh the hazardous
chemicals are involved 
""
When  leakage or spillage
 so far the factories are concerned
""
""
Or people travelling on the highway  when transportation of
hazardous chemicals is involved 
""
Or people living in far away distances  where the hazardous
chemicals are stored  and something goes
wrong 
""
Or take another area 
""
If the housing is not properly designed  and the construction or
""
unsafe housing 
""
Apart from the most obvious one  like the collapse of the house
""
 if
the  latrines or
urinals begin to  then that
leads to a different kind of health hazard 
and arising out of 
""
Now  more obvious known cases of safety of housing happen to be
""
where a part or whole of the house collapses  and as a result of which
large number of people 
""
And this kind of things we have to see even  more often in case
of public buildings  dams and things of
that kind 
""
So therefore the question that arises is  that if this is the
 so far as their health
""
""
Now one can talk of some measures that the consumers can take 
""
For example  you should ensure
to see that  are not likely to cause
cancer 
""
Or if you take the examples of domestic electrical appliances 
whether do they carry  bureau of Indian
standards in the country 
""
Or  whether they happen to be
of a good quality  nor
the life of the garments are likely to be affected 
""
So  the consumers themselves can
take care  following the
instructions 
even before buying the products  one can take certain measures to see that
""
""
There is another area of consumer safety  namely the
adulteration of food 
""
And there are cases reported time and again in the news papers 
where because of the food poisoning people tend to die  or run into far
more serious 
""
There are also very subtle kinds of cases  there are
some articles or some components in the food  to which certain people
might be alergic  they tend to suffer a great
deal 
""
Take another area 
""
Now ordinarily all of us understand  that medicine is supposed
to help us 
""
But there are 
""
Take those medicines  which are available across the counter
""
""
So in a sense 
when these medicines are purchased across the counter 
how much information 
when he uses those medicines as such 
""
You must have seen the reports of  when
because of the adulterated 
about fourteen children died 
""
Now  across the counter which look
very innocent  in respect of
certain categories of patients like  or
aged people suffering from 
""
So therefore  which normally supposed
to help us  or the problems of
safety 
""
Now let us take  you are not able to
immediately connect  the use of the product or the existance of the
product with the safety 
""
Take for example asbestos 
""
Now the people who have been working in the asbestos factory 
there has been situations where  after five years of the retirement or ten
years of the retirement 
and by that time they might have not only left the factory but they might
have left even the city where they were working  and might have gone to
their respective villages  that this
particular 
to 
""
Not only that  even the people who happen to come in contact
with the workers 
""
Even 
material is used 
roofing  and in the course of time they
disintegrate and they affect the consumers as well 
""
And this is such a slow process  that it may take place after
six months after five years or fifteen years  and one is not able to
realise 
""
Take another example  the disposal of toxic waste or
disposal of uh 
""
They might  on the
 might be
found thirty forty miles away  from the place where they were discharged
""
""
Or  and may be
after fifteen years  and the ground
water gets affected 
""
So therefore 
kinds of situations that I have described  that the area of consumer
safety is so wide and so large  that one has to be extremely careful or
cautious 
""
Now  that all this is
fine 
""
Now there are number of things that can be done and one can only
illustrate 
""
Say for example  take domestic electrical appliances and some
of the items that we use 
""
Because of the public opinion pressure  the
government of India came forward  the I S I
standards  for these
domestic electrical appliances  but now in respect of some items for the
country as a whole  now called B I
S 
these electric irons 
a 
""
Now those about eight items 
 but even
certification  unless
these items carry I S I certification mark  they cannot be sold in the
country 
""
Now at least one thing  that I S I certification assures you is
 at least they are safe
products 
""
They may or may not be of extraordinarily high quality  but
certainly they give you an assurance 
""
If by chance  though he is carrying an I S
I mark  then his
liability becomes much bigger 
""
And in any case  helps you in
respect of dealing with that kind of situation  either in terms of
replacement of goods or any other remedy that may become available 
""
Uh in case of Gujarat  the state has gone even a step further
 I S I
standards were made mandatory  way back in nineteen seventy-six and
further amended in nineteen eighty-one  are
required to carry an I S I certification mark  before they are being sold
or marketed 
""
Uh  that either they carry I S I
certification mark  provided by
chief electrical engineer 
""
So this is one measure  where the consumers can feel reassured
that if they use the I S I certificated marks  electrical goods in the
home 
""
Another example that I want to you give is very interesting one 
uh but is a foreign one 
""
This happened  in United States and particularly in the state of
California 
""
Uh somewhere around nineteen seventy-one  or meaning around that
decade  uh in the short words it
was called des D E S 
""
Now this particular brand of medicine  was introduced in the
market 
""
The drug was found to be effective  so far as prevention of
miscarriage 
""
But  not on the
pregnant women who took the medicine  born of
those pregnancies  reached the age
of puberty 
""
And those daughters were found to suffer from cancer  and an
interesting question of law arose  born
of these pregnancies  the pharmaceutical
companies 
""
You can imagine the difficulty involved  that the daughters who
are the victims  the consumers
of the medicine 
""
And their mothers had consumed this medicine  before fifteen
twenty years 
""
And the matter went to the 
California  and the court found a
solution to this problem  was
manufactured and marketed  by a large number of pharamceutical companies
 the total sale of
the medicine  how
much was the share  of each of this particular
products by each of the pharmaceutical companies  and depending upon the
market share 
during seventies  let us say may
be 
""
And and then  on the principles of
apportionment  as to how much money shall
be paid  to these daughters who
had suffered from cancer because of  the adverse effect of this medicine
""
""
As for a statistical information I can tell you  that there are
about one thousand such suits 
""
Now of course this particular drug has been withdrawn from the
market 
""
So what one would like to look at  that
there are preventive measures  which can be taken by the consumers and or
the authorities concerned  unfortunate
event  there are remedies
available 
""
And  or a large
unusual kind of condition  the
cause effect relationship  and its
consequence and yet  substantial
amount of damages from the pharmaceutical companies 
""
Let us now come to the Indian scene 
""
If on account of  of any unsafe goods or
 of which I gave a number of illustrations or examples
""
""
If the consumer  what remedies are
available to him  ?
""
Under the Consumer Protection Act 
three tier  consumer
grievence  state commission and
national commission 
""
Now if the consumer is able to prove  the loss or
injury 
was on account of  of the people who provided the
goods or services  in
respect of loss or injuries suffered by him 
""
So therefore  not only provide the remedy
 and least time
consumings  and they are
specialised tribunals
