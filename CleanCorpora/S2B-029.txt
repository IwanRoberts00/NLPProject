In the last programme  four basic consumer
""
""
""
""
consumers'  of all
""
""
Now  where wide range
""
relation to health hazard 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We do not realise but  the poor or unsafe quality
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
chemical industry 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the babes in their arms 
""
Take other areas  Domestic electrical appliances
""
""
These are of day to day use  and there are cases of
""
""
""
Now  uh the hazardous
chemicals are involved 
""
""
 so far the factories are concerned
""
""
Or people travelling on the highway  when transportation of
hazardous chemicals is involved 
""
Or people living in far away distances  where the hazardous
chemicals are stored  and something goes
""
""
""
""
If the housing is not properly designed  and the construction or
""
""
""
""
""
 if
""
""
leads to a different kind of health hazard 
""
""
Now  more obvious known cases of safety of housing happen to be
""
""
large number of people 
""
""
of public buildings  dams and things of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
standards in the country 
""
Or  whether they happen to be
""
the life of the garments are likely to be affected 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
more serious 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But there are 
""
Take those medicines  which are available across the counter
""
""
""
when these medicines are purchased across the counter 
how much information 
""
""
""
because of the adulterated 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
immediately connect  the use of the product or the existance of the
""
""
""
""
""
there has been situations where  after five years of the retirement or ten
""
""
have left even the city where they were working  and might have gone to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
material is used 
""
disintegrate and they affect the consumers as well 
""
""
six months after five years or fifteen years  and one is not able to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or  and may be
""
""
""
""
""
safety is so wide and so large  that one has to be extremely careful or
""
""
""
""
""
Now there are number of things that can be done and one can only
illustrate 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
country as a whole  now called B I
""
""
a 
""
Now those about eight items 
""
""
these items carry I S I certification mark  they cannot be sold in the
""
""
Now at least one thing  that I S I certification assures you is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I mark  then his
liability becomes much bigger 
""
And in any case  helps you in
""
""
""
""
""
standards were made mandatory  way back in nineteen seventy-six and
""
required to carry an I S I certification mark  before they are being sold
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that if they use the I S I certificated marks  electrical goods in the
""
""
Another example that I want to you give is very interesting one 
""
""
""
""
""
""
decade  uh in the short words it
""
""
""
""
""
The drug was found to be effective  so far as prevention of
""
""
But  not on the
""
those pregnancies  reached the age
""
""
And those daughters were found to suffer from cancer  and an
""
of these pregnancies  the pharmaceutical
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the matter went to the 
""
solution to this problem  was
manufactured and marketed  by a large number of pharamceutical companies
""
the medicine  how
""
products by each of the pharmaceutical companies  and depending upon the
market share 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
about one thousand such suits 
""
Now of course this particular drug has been withdrawn from the
""
""
So what one would like to look at  that
there are preventive measures  which can be taken by the consumers and or
""
""
available

unusual kind of condition  the
cause effect relationship  and its
