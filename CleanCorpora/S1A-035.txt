Uh ah it is nice to meet you Mr Thomas 
Especially in this circumstances
Ah uh uhm I thought and I'll tell you
something about my experience as a teacher
Very glad to hear sir
Uh 
Where were you working ?
 For after my M A M A in English in nineteen
sixty-eight I started teaching in a prestigious college in Trivandrum
 Marvine co 
 Sir you have a very long experience sir 
as a teacher 
 That is that is true 
About more than twenty-five years now uh
 I've been teaching for the last fifteen years 
Fifteen years yeah 
Uh you you have taught only in one college
Only in one college 
But my experience is varied 
I taught for uh nine plus C S in Trivandrum in
Marvines College Trivandrum 
Then uh
So naturally you are familiar with the Trivandrum politics and
such a things 
Yes yes uh lot you know because it was at the prime of
my youth you know I was in Trivandrum
So ?
So I was very much interested in the uh student politics
in watching how students take part in politics
Very good sir 
And also the various developments you know the 
Communist government in Kerala 
In sixty-eight you mean 
That is true
Uh in sixties-seven second communist ministry came into
power
Power in Kerala 
Then uh the emergency period you know all this uh
happened when I was
During that emergency period you are were
 in Trivandrum ?
I was in Trivandrum 
Infact I appreciated one aspect of emergency know our
people were all disciplined
 Haan disciplined 
But of course freedom was curtailed you know 
Some could arrest you and take you to the prison without
questioning 
But there was one thing I saw
See one aspect is that in our state there was
not not such a misuse of emergency
 Yeah yeah 
Ah ha ha that is true 
Uhm I saw people you know in offices all going on time coming back
on
For we we didn't find it ve too much uh that
troublesome
Yes yes yes 
I would like to tell you something about my experience as a
teacher 
 Yes sir continue sir 
Uhm then perhaps you may you will tell me uh your
experience about a teacher 
Uh I told you that I taught for nine years in Trivandrum
Yes sir 
Then uhm I registered my name in the ministry of external
affairs uh foreign assingnment section and uh when
there was a chance for teachers in Nigeria the ministry supplied the
names of teachers who have registered their names with the ministry 
And I was called for an interview 
Uhm they submitted the name in the Nigerian High Commission in
Delhi and people from the High Commisssion came to Trivandrum to
interview 
And uh I was interviewed and I was selected for
 Yes 
Oh you were in Ni Nigeria
Yes that is true uh for a teaching post
Hey that is very nice experience
Yeah 
It was a very nice experience you know you are true 
How many years did you spend there ?
Uh I spent uh ten years
Ten years
Ten long years a decade 
It was a pleasant experience because that uh there have
been an opportunity to get exposed to people from different parts of the
country
Uhm in the past many teachers from our state went to Nigeria
Ah ah some perhaps some of your relatives are
there
Yes them
 Haan haan 
 They've spent five years or at the maximum ten years
there
Ah ha ha 
Then one one thing I enjoyed about my uh work in Nigeria
was we had annual leave you know 
After ten years we got two months leave and we could come
home during those two months 
And that Nigerian government paid for our travel and
The other leave allowances
Yes yes and other leave allowances
So every year you had three or two months stay 
 Every year I used to come yes yes 
And it is not only for me for my whole family
Ah yeah
My wife and two children uh to and fro tickets 
And uh that gave me an opportunity to travel through different
countries visit uh
Oh you visited other countries also
Yes yes 
If I number the countries I visited I think it is about
twenty-three
How laughs surprising
Yeah that was one uh privilege I enjoyed uh uh by
my service overseas 
I could travel I could go to U S A to Canada to England 
European many countries in Europe many countries in 
Middle East and some countries in Africa 
Apart from Nigeria I could travel through some other countries
in Africa that there have been opportunity to visit many uh
countries 
So that gave me an opportunity to get exposed to 
people 
 Very good 
 Then after that ten years service you
returned to Trivandrum ?
Yes yes 
I went in the year nineteen seventy-seven and uh I returned
in nineteen eighty-seven 
And uh I was planning to settle down in Trivandrum I started
constructing my house 
There 
Then yes that is true
Then what happened ?
Uh then something very providential happened
 I'll call it providential because I never expected
that such a thing will happen
You are a believer 
Yes I believe in uh God's plan in my life 
And uh I saw an advertisement in one of the Indian Kerala
newspaper about a post in Karnataka 
And uhm naturally when I found that it was a post in ke
 in a college in a degree college and I was eligible to apply
I applied for it 
And I waited for two months you know
There was no reply but all of a sudden I got an invitation for
interview 
That happened
Then the Karnataka college
From Karnataka college 
I had never travelled to Karnataka 
It was the first time I travelled to Karnataka 
Though you have visited twenty-seven foreign nations
Yes yes I I visited many countries in uh all
over the world but I I had yet to discover India you know 
So I got an opportunity to travel to Karnataka for my
interview 
That was in the month of May ninety
Seventy-seven
Uh nineteen eighty eighty-eight
Eighty-eight
Yes 
Then after the interview they asked me to join in the
month of July 
So I joined the college 
As principal ?
Uh not exactly
I was appointed as a Reader in English 
There was another principal when I joined
They had another principal means two principals laughs
That is no I was not appointed as a principal then 
And it also happened providentially I will say because the 
then Principal he wanted to go for higher studies in England 
He took one mon one years leave and uh went to
England 
Then uh I was the senior most person in the college and so 
they asked me to
So you were promoted 
Uh yes I I was asked to be the acting Principal for one
year until he returned 
Then uh when he returned he didn't want to take charge as a
Principal 
He did not receive his responsibility 
Did he continued as a teacher ?
Uh uh beg your pardon
The that that fellow
No no no uhm he he returned and the management was
running a school 
Uh infact the school is a prestigious school uh with more
than two thousand students 
And he took over as the Principal of the school
And the mantle fell on me and I became the Principal
 In charge 
 Principal yes
So that was in nineteen eighty-nine 
And from eighty-nine onwards I'm the Principal in that
college 
Then you tell me something about your experience as 
teacher as a teacher ?
 Yeah yeah sir 
My experience is not that of a Principal laughs or
anything like that you know the background
Yes 
And the situation in Kerala 
There are many teachers there
 Accha 
I got this appointment in nineteen eighty-one 
As a lecturer there
Yes 
After taking my degree from Indore 
Ah ha you told me once you told me that 
I took my M A from Indore University

Then naturally I had to seek for a job for a four
years
Ah ha 
So I got this appointment in eighty-one 
Ah ha 
Then joined as a lecturer ju junior lecturer

Yeah 
And for last fifteen years I've been working

happened in nineteen ninety
Ah ha 
And you know uh everything about uh 
this Kerala and our Raichin our that particular aspects 
 yeah though you were away from Kerala for a long time
 Uh 
 Yeah 
Yes every year I was coming and I uh sliding down 
And we are very happy or we are actually proud of our
state uhm because people are there all over the world from
our state uhm uhm 
Then if you go to every part of India to any part of India you
can notice that there are Malyalis
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
Uh not only India every part of the world you know 
 ahn 
Some people commented that if you go to the moon you know there

 political alliance there ah ha 
This time the Left Front have came in power
Once again our Nayanar he is the chief minister there

Actually this people expected that some other would be the
chief minister ah ha but in politics you can not expect
anything
 Ah ha

 Yeah 
 Ah ha

So but this the samething is happening there you just see 
do you know the dilemma of the Kerala politicians now or that the
Congress is in opposition there ah ha 
The Marxist are ruling yeah but at the same time
 they are both these parties are supporting the 
yeah I know Deve Gowda ministry yeah in the centre

Ah ha coconuts you know in in our place Karnataka

But in Kerala we do not use that much tender one sir
Ah yes yes and even a doctors say when you go
the hospital uhn they'll prescribe tender
