Uhm uhm
""
""
Then uh  you know still little
bit ahead of time
""
""
Uh 
""
""
And 
will go to  to bring him
""
""
I see 
""
""
I was looking at the airport  whether he
wants anybody to come there
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Or  come earlier
""
""
Yeah 
""
Now uh 
""
""
No  the
taperecorder doesn't seem to be working
""
""
""
""
""
Uh
""
""
Do you have a transistor recorder  ?
""
""
Uhn  I don't have a transister
recorder  friend as you know Dr S V Shastri
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Uh he has come here for today
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And he is doing some  U G C Project
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""

For which spoken English  so he wants to record
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
So he has got a taperecorder and everything 
so he was keen to record that 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh you see the he  and the text
of his speech is ready  suppose to
bring it to the airport  but still he will deliver it
""
""
So you can bring it  it may be good if you can record it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  but only I wanted your permission
""
""
No  because
university is saying this thing is not working  so if you
 then they can
plug in and  that mike
condition system we don't know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
 uh before four thirty
""
""
""
""
""
Very good  be nice
""
""
Uh 
""
""
I will be there and  Muralidhar and Gosaval
""
""
Yeah  but your those people will have to be told
""
""
Yeah oh yes  not there
""
untill Muralidhar 
everything starts
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And he has got a  very sophisticated system like in the T V
 to his shirt
""
""
That is how he recorded for the last time
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No but in this  in this case
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Uh I don't know whether that would be possible 
""
We have a system whereby  see it is connected
from the mike 
""
""
""
""
""
Mike
""
""
That type  that will be better
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Because  mike
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
Supposing his equipment has separate mike
""
""
Uhm
""
""
That also can be put it  put there
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And we can put it somewhere  some side table
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
It will be good if he comes a little early  uhm
 so it can be tested
""
""
""
""

won't match
