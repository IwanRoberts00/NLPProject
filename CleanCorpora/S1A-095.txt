Which you know four thirty 
And where is he staying ?
 Raj Bhavan 
 Raj Bhavan 
Now I called your residence

Right 
So uh you will be coming there along with him or
No no no uhn he is going to Raj
Bhavan 
 Uhn 
Ah
 I'll come back to campus
Uhm uhm
Then uh I'll probably you know still little
bit ahead of time
Uh 
And then somebody will go to Dr one word 
will go to Raj Bhavan to bring him
I see 
I was looking at the airport uhm whether he
wants anybody to come there
 Uhm 
Yeah 
Or he'll come earlier
Yeah 
Now uh you see is the speech going to be recorded 
No we wanted to record uhm the
taperecorder doesn't seem to be working
 Uhm 
Uh
Do you have a transistor recorder ?
Uhn I've uh I don't have a transister
recorder but you know my friend as you know Dr S V Shastri
Uhm uhm 
Uh he has come here for today
Uhm
And he is doing some U G C Project
Uhm uhm 
For which spoken English so he wants to record
Uhm uhm
So he has got a taperecorder and everything ah 
so he was keen to record that 
 Ah 
Uh you see the he Shivaraj Patil's and the text
of his speech is ready uhm and he's suppose to
bring it to the airport uhm but still he will deliver it
 yeah 
So you can bring it it may be good if you can record it
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
Yeah but only I wanted your permission
No it'll be a welcome uhm because
university is saying this thing is not working ah so if you
 maybe come a little bit earlier yeah then they can
plug in and test it yeah because you that mike
condition system we don't know
 Uhm 
 Ah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 That's right 
So he'll be there before I will you know come with him 
 ahn or he may come directly uh before four thirty
 Ahn 
Very good that'll be nice
Uh so you will be there 
I will be there and Muralidhar and Gosaval
Yeah but your those people will have to be told

 uhm you'll have to wait yeah 
untill Muralidhar yeah because he will be there till 
everything starts
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
And he has got a very sophisticated system like in the T V
 uhm the person you know if he puts that uh to his shirt
 uh uh then the voice is recorded very accurately 
That is how he recorded for the last time
 Uhm 
 Ah 
No but in this in this case
Uh 
Uh I don't know whether that would be possible 
We have a system whereby uhn see it is connected
from the mike 
 Uhn 
Mike
That type uhn that will be better
 Uhn 
Yeah
Because he'll be speaking into the mike
Yeah any way if uh will he will 
 Let him bring it 
Supposing his equipment has separate mike
Uhm
That also can be put it put there
Yeah
And we can put it somewhere some side table
Uhm uhm 
It will be good if he comes a little early uhm
 so it can be tested
 Uhm 
Yeah 
Sometimes uhm instruments of this and that
won't match
 Uhm 
 That's right
