""
Let me start 
""
One  laws of mathematics refer to reality
""
""
As far as they are certain  they do not refer to reality
""
""
This is by 
""
 and
logic 
""
All traditional logic  are
employed 
""
It is therefore not applicable to this 
but only  celestial
existence 
""
That is 
""
 our ability
to make  about its
behaviour 
""
Until a threshold is reached  precision and
significance 
""
This is Lotsizadeh  Fuzzy
sets 
""
The first is 
""
The second is 
""
And the third 
""
So 
""
""
What was his name  ?
""
""
Lotsizadeh  B B writing
""
""
The scientist  are unanimous
 far short of their
expectations 
""
Let us probe a little deeper 
""
Consider the following three questions 
""
Question one  What will be the distance of the planet
Neptune  two thousand and one
 ?
""
Question two  Who will win maximum world medals in the
forth coming Olympics  ?
""
Question three  to live
in  ?
""
The first question  the question about distance
 and it is possible to
give 
""
In some cases  may not be possible at the
present level of technological development  a general
consensus about the theoritical existence of such answers 
""
The questions of this type  with admirably
adequate efficiency by present day mathematics 
""
The second question  in the
different category 
""
Though the question is precise  the precise answer is not
possible 
""
These are speculating questions 
""
And there probablistic answers can be given  with the help of
""
""
However  it is the third type of question which is of primary
importance 
""
 by the turn
of the century  ?
""
Such type of questions  cover very vast areas of our cognition
""
""
Most of the real life problems 
""
The formulation  in a
very vague language 
""
The meaning of the question  not only from
person to person  and
yet the question is quite meaningful 
""
All of us will agree  much to be
desired 
""
But the prescription of the 
betterment 
""
""
 ?
""
Let us not labour on happiness 
""
Philosophers have written volumes 
and the ways to achieve it 
""
But nobody seems to have been benefitted  reading
 and possibly their
authors 
""
But  ?
""
The word 
""
But 
""
How much wealth one should amass  so that one is called rich
""
""
Rockfeller is rich  an average Indian is not
rich 
""
So  all of
us agree 
""
But such agreement 
""
A person  may be an average
middle class commoner 
""
Thus the concept of richness  highly subjective
""
""
Besides  ?
""
One whose annual income is 
""
And if 
whose income is little less than that  ?
""
Say 
""
And 
where one cannot decide  getting the specific amount
would be placed 
""
For one may seek  the richness
 need not be
considered non-rich 
""
Thus  is not only highly arbitrary
""
""
And still the question is meaningful 
""
Most of the questions of real world are of this nature 
""
They are fuzzy 
""
So what causes fuzziness  ?
""
There are several factors 
""
Let me mention 
""
Natural language  and foremost among the causes
of fuzziness 
""
Again  a
""
""
But  one
word 
""
Consider for example  uh
 intelligent lady
 or for that matter
""
""
 you will get much
more 
""
Heavier vehicle 
""
The more  the more they are the same
""
""
Though  all these are very much meaningful sentences their
meaning is never precise 
""
The second factor 
subjective 
""
Added to intrinsic fuzziness of  there is some
subjective element related 
""
The same word  at different
places  and in different
circumstances 
""
A young man of twenty-five year  will consider a fifty year old
 the fifty
year old  he's
""
""
Uh there is a very beautiful story about uh  in
""
""
Well it is not 
""
Prajapati  the supreme
 and
monster 
""
Prajapati created them all  in his
world 
""
So they asked him 
""
Prajapati said  capital
""
""
The 
""
They wanted everything for themselves  that must be the cause
of their grief 
""
So Prajapati must have told them 
""
Charity starts with C 
""
 that they
were 
drinking nector 
""
So  to control
themselves  take better
of them 
""
Monsters thought 
""
They did not care for miseries of others 
""
That must be the cause of their own misery 
""
So Prajapati 
""
Thus 
compassion 
""
Well  that in this type of questions some
psychological factors are 
""
""
So let us consider the problem of  warmness of
water 
""
Here the concept of warmness depends on the particular person 
particular time particular place particular season  and above all the
particular mental or physical condition of the user 
""
Note that  is not
of academic interest  but of economic interest of manufacturers of shower
bath 
""
And hence 
""
The third factor that contributes to fuzziness  is inadequacy of
information 
""
Many a time  of the
system 
""
For example  he knows
no final truth 
""
He may be sceptic even about well established theory 
""
On the frontiers of knowledge  he is always on slippery ground
""
""
If in addition 
inadequate  guess work
""
""
Then all he has to rely upon 
based on  unprovable basic
assumptions 
""
These assumptions 
perceptions 
""
Sometimes  insufficient data
""
""
For example if you are working with  strategies in the
battlefield 
""
Next factor  is
interdependence 
""
A cyclical behaviour of natural phenomena 
favourite concept of  ancient
Indian 
""
And cycle has no cut points 
""
The seeds of decay 
in the growth itself 
""
The transformation of growth into decay  that
you cannot put a demarcation line between them 
""
Or let us be more plain 
""
If the demand of certain commodity increases 
rises 
""
But the rise in price 
""
The end affects the means 
""
To win elections  some
populist measures 
""
But  deficit
financing 
""
And prices rise 
""
If the prices rise  difficult to win in the elections
""
""
This interdependents of concepts  causes fuzziness in decision
""
""
In complex systems like human body  ec
""
very easily 
""
Complexity of the system is one more cause of fuzziness 
""
In many real life problems  specially where human element is
involved  or
even to take into account all the 
""
Then it becomes a matter of personal choice  to decide which
factors are to be considered and which are 
""
And 
""
Then 
""
Many a time 
all the parametres of the system 
""
But 
it is more profitable to ignore certain factors  and the choice of
relevant factors depends 
""
This causes 
""
Fuzziness of concept  to paradoxes
""
""
Here are 
""
Suppose 
small italics 
""
""
""
If we uh remove stones from heap  it will be
a smaller 
""
But even if we add a stone to a small heap  it will remain
small 
""
Now let us start 
which is definitely small 
""
Since addition of the stone  does not affect the smallness of
the heap 
""
One stone at a time 
""
And still continue to get a small heap  to the
paradoxical situation 
""
Another uhm paradox which I am going to  state here is
""
""
We all know 
""
In this order  that
""
""
One can easily observe 
and  however close to each
other  B
""
""
In fact  there are uncountably many of them
lying between 
""
Real numbers  on an infinite
continual 
""
Any two adjacent points  on
the continuum 
that they almost overlap 
""
The last universalist  described this
situation by the following formula 
""
""
""
""
""
But 
""
""
Uh  may be
""
""
Suppose  a whole spectrum of different shades of
colours 
of lightness of or 
""
The change in two consecutive shades is so  and
gradual 
""
If  are three
neighbouring shades  cannot be separated
from  S two from S three
""
""
However  can be separated from
""
""
And in this sense 
S two  S three
 S three
""
""
Finally 
""
This is an ancient paradox 
""
Also know as a paradox of a lier 
""
 a
""
""
Now if  then being a
lier himself 
""
On the other hand if his statement is fuzz  then he not being a
lier 
""
Thus the statement is true if and only if it is fuzz 
""
These paradoxes are the results of our attempt to put  in
precisely 
""
The classic case of fitting  a square pet in the round hole
""
""
Naturally  between the two
""
""
The deductive method  that we employ to derive theorems in
mathematics and logic  is based on the following three basic Aristotlian
laws 
""
""
""
""
""
""
The second law 
""
""
 X
 Y
""
""
""
""
No proposition  X
 Y
""
""
Just as in a soap opera a character is all good or all bad  we
have  the whole untruth
""
""
There is no room for partial truth 
""
For this reason Aristotlian logic is called  two valued logic
