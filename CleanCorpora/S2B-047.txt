Let me start 
""
""
""
""
As far as they are certain  they do not refer to reality
""
""
This is by 
""
 and
""
""
All traditional logic  are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to make  about its
""
""
Until a threshold is reached  precision and
""
""
This is Lotsizadeh  Fuzzy
""
""
""
""
The second is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
expectations 
""
Let us probe a little deeper 
""
Consider the following three questions 
""
""
""
 ?
""
Question two  Who will win maximum world medals in the
forth coming Olympics  ?
""
Question three  to live
""
""
The first question  the question about distance
 and it is possible to
""
""
In some cases  may not be possible at the
""
consensus about the theoritical existence of such answers 
""
The questions of this type  with admirably
adequate efficiency by present day mathematics 
""
""
""
""
""
possible 
""
""
""
""
""
""
However  it is the third type of question which is of primary
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But the prescription of the 
betterment 
""
""
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
us agree 
""
But such agreement 
""
A person  may be an average
""
""
Thus the concept of richness  highly subjective
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 need not be
""
""
""
""
""
And still the question is meaningful 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Natural language  and foremost among the causes
""
""
""
""
""
""
word 
""
""
 intelligent lady
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The more  the more they are the same
""
""
Though  all these are very much meaningful sentences their
""
""
""
""
""
Added to intrinsic fuzziness of  there is some
subjective element related 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well it is not 
""
""
 and
""
""
Prajapati created them all  in his
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The 
""
They wanted everything for themselves  that must be the cause
of their grief 
""
""
""
""
""
 that they
""
drinking nector 
""
""
""
""
""
Monsters thought 
""
They did not care for miseries of others 
""
That must be the cause of their own misery 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
psychological factors are 
""
""
""
""
""
Here the concept of warmness depends on the particular person 
""
particular mental or physical condition of the user 
""
""
of academic interest  but of economic interest of manufacturers of shower
""
""
And hence 
""
The third factor that contributes to fuzziness  is inadequacy of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
inadequate  guess work
""
""
Then all he has to rely upon 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
battlefield 
""
Next factor  is
""
""
A cyclical behaviour of natural phenomena 
favourite concept of  ancient
""
""
And cycle has no cut points 
""
""
in the growth itself 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
populist measures 
""
But  deficit
""
""
And prices rise 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
even to take into account all the 
""
""
factors are to be considered and which are 
""
""
""
Then 
""
Many a time 
""
""
""
it is more profitable to ignore certain factors  and the choice of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Suppose 
small italics 
""
""
""
If we uh remove stones from heap  it will be
""
""
But even if we add a stone to a small heap  it will remain
small 
""
Now let us start 
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

We all know
