Let me start with some quotations 
One As far as laws of mathematics refer to reality
 they are not certain 
As far as they are certain they do not refer to reality
 
This is by Albert Einstein 
 Introduction of exactness in mathematics and
logic is artificial and forced 
All traditional logic assumes that precise symbols are
employed 
It is therefore not applicable to this terrestrial life 
but only can imaginal imaginary celestial
existence 
That is Burtrend Russell 
 As the complexity of the system increases our ability
to make precise and yet significant statements about its
behaviour diminishes 
Until a threshold is reached beyond which precision and
significance become mutually exclusive characters 
This is Lotsizadeh the founder or discoverer of Fuzzy
sets 
The first is a physicist scientist 
The second is a philosopher mathematician logician 
And the third is a technocrat 
So 
What was his name ?
Lotsizadeh L O T S I Z A D E H B B writing
 
The scientist philosophers and technologist are unanimous
 on one point Mathematics falls far short of their
expectations in coping with reality 
Let us probe a little deeper 
Consider the following three questions 
Question one What will be the distance of the planet
Neptune from Earth on March twenty-eight two thousand and one
 ?
Question two Who will win maximum world medals in the
forth coming Olympics ?
Question three Will the world be better to live
in by the turn of the century ?
The first question the question about distance
 is precise and is and it is possible to
give a reasonably precise answer 
In some cases a precise answer may not be possible at the
present level of technological development but there is a general
consensus about the theoritical existence of such answers 
The questions of this type can be handled with admirably
adequate efficiency by present day mathematics 
The second question about the medals falls in the
different category 
Though the question is precise the precise answer is not
possible till the event actually takes place 
These are speculating questions 
And there probablistic answers can be given with the help of
 statistical theory 
However it is the third type of question which is of primary
importance to me in my today's talk 
 Will the world be a better place to live in by the turn
of the century ?
Such type of questions cover very vast areas of our cognition
Most of the real life problems belongs to this category 
The formulation of these types of question is in a
very vague language 
The meaning of the question may change not only from
person to person but from time to time for the same person and
yet the question is quite meaningful 
All of us will agree that this world needs much to be
desired 
But the prescription of the better 
betterment of the world changes from person to person 
 Will everybody be happy if he or she is rich 
 ?
Let us not labour on happiness 
Philosophers have written volumes on the state of happiness 
and the ways to achieve it 
But nobody seems to have been benefitted from the reading
 of those books except their publishers and possibly their
authors 
But what about the richness ?
The word richness has many shades 
But I'm using it in a very mundane earthly sense 
How much wealth one should amass so that one is called rich
Rockfeller is rich so is Ford an average Indian is not
rich 
So I think there is some standard on which all of
us agree 
But such agreement does not last long 
A person whom I consider very rich may be an average
middle class commoner in the sense of Rockfeller 
Thus the concept of richness seems to be highly subjective
 relative or self referential 
Besides who should be call rich ?
One whose annual income is say five million 
And if the answer is affirmative what about the one 
whose income is little less than that ?
Say forty-five hundred thousand 
And this argument will continue till a stage is reached 
where one cannot decide whether a person getting the specific amount
would be placed in the category of rich persons or not 
For one may seek any threshold for deciding the richness
 but a person earning little less than the limit need not be
considered non-rich 
Thus the so called threshold is not only highly arbitrary
 but extremely foggy and indiscernible 
And still the question is meaningful 
Most of the questions of real world are of this nature 
They are fuzzy 
So what causes fuzziness ?
There are several factors which contribute to fuzziness 
Let me mention some of them 
Natural language the first and foremost among the causes
of fuzziness is the intrinsic weakness of natural languages 
Again it is very much debatable whether it is a
 the strength or the weakness 
But there are no two opinions that there is some one
word vagueness in all natural languages 
Consider for example the following adjectives uh
 tall fellow an intelligent lady
 a handsome youth or for that matter
 the following sentences 
 If you work a little harder you will get much
more 
Heavier vehicle should be driven more cautiously 
The more they change the more they are the same
 
Though all these are very much meaningful sentences their
meaning is never precise 
The second factor contributing to fuzziness is 
subjective preferences 
Added to intrinsic fuzziness of a language there is some
subjective element related to the user 
The same word may have different meanings at different
places to different persons at different times and in different
circumstances 
A young man of twenty-five year will consider a fifty year old
 man a old man but if you ask the opinion of the fifty
year old on the same question he will say that he's
 quite young and energetic 
Uh there is a very beautiful story about uh this in
 Vedas 
Well it is not written here uh completely 
Prajapati the sup the supreme
 Creator was once approached by humans god and
monster 
Prajapati created them all but they were unhappy in his
world 
So they asked him to advise them 
Prajapati said C C C I mean capital
 C 
The human thought that they were greedy 
They wanted everything for themselves that must be the cause
of their grief 
So Prajapati must have told them to show charity 
Charity starts with C 
 G god thought that they
were pleasure seekers they all the time sitting in the heavens 
drinking nector and engaged in sensual pleasure 
So god uh the Prajapati asked them to control
themselves and not to allow their passions to take better
of them 
Monsters thought that they were cruel and unkind 
They did not care for miseries of others 
That must be the cause of their own misery 
So Prajapati asked them to show compassion 
Thus C became charity for men control for god 
compassion for monsters 
Well let us assume that in this type of questions some
psychological factors are in involved 
So let us consider the problem of controlling warmness of
water in shower bath 
Here the concept of warmness depends on the particular person 
particular time particular place particular season and above all the
particular mental or physical condition of the user 
Note that this problem unlike the earlier one is not
of academic interest but of economic interest of manufacturers of shower
bath equipments 
And hence for control engineers 
The third factor that contributes to fuzziness is inadequacy of
information 
Many a time there is no sufficient knowledge of the
system 
For example scientist is always aware that he knows
no final truth 
He may be sceptic even about well established theory 
On the frontiers of knowledge he is always on slippery ground
If in addition the data is ana 
inadequate everything becomes a matter of guess work
Then all he has to rely upon is a working hypothesis 
based on state of the aa knowledge and unprovable basic
assumptions 
These assumptions can be a matter of verbal 
perceptions as in medical and social problems 
Sometimes one has to infer not only from insufficient data
 but also from information which is not wholly reliable 
For example if you are working with strategies in the
battlefield 
Next factor that contributes to fuzziness is
interdependence of concepts 
A cyclical behaviour of natural phenomena is a very 
favourite concept of Indian a ancient
Indian philosophers 
And cycle has no cut points 
The seeds of decay for an Indian philosopher are present 
in the growth itself 
The transformation of growth into decay is so subtle that
you cannot put a demarcation line between them 
Or let us be more plain 
If the demand of certain commodity increases its price 
rises 
But the rise in price results in decrease in the demand 
The end affects the means and the means affect the end 
To win elections a political party has to take some
populist measures 
But such measures result into deficient deficit
financing and causes inflation 
And prices rise 
If the prices rise it is difficult to win in the elections
This interdependents of concepts causes fuzziness in decision
In complex systems like human body or national ec
 economy the effects of this fuzziness can be 
very easily observed 
Complexity of the system is one more cause of fuzziness 
In many real life problems specially where human element is
involved the system is so complex that it is impossible to control or
even to take into account all the affecting factors 
Then it becomes a matter of personal choice to decide which
factors are to be considered and which are to be ignored 
And such a choice in general is not easy 
Then cost effectiveness 
Many a time it is theoritically possible to quantify 
all the parametres of the system 
But the cost involved in doing so is so huge that 
it is more profitable to ignore certain factors and the choice of
relevant factors depends many times on personal preferences 
This causes fuzziness 
Fuzziness of concept is an open invitation to paradoxes
Here are some of them 
Suppose we have a small heap of stones 
small italics 
 Smallness is a fuzzy concept 
If we uh remove stones from heap then of course it will be
a smaller heap 
But even if we add a stone to a small heap it will remain
small 
Now let us start with the heap of a single stone 
which is definitely small 
Since addition of the stone does not affect the smallness of
the heap one can go on adding a stone 
One stone at a time 
And still continue to get a small heap this leads to the
paradoxical situation where every heap is small 
Another uhm paradox which I am going to state here is
 Bonkare paradox 
We all know that real numbers are totally ordered 
In this order they are so densely close to each other that
 it is impossible to separate consecutive real numbers 
One can easily observe that if A 
and B are two real numbers however close to each
other there is a number A plus B
 by two that lies between them 
In fact they're there are uncountably many of them
lying between A and B 
Real numbers can be represented as points on an infinite
continual uh a straight line 
Any two adjacent points on the con on
the continuum are so indistinguishable from each other 
that they almost overlap 
The last universalist Henry Bonkare described this
situation by the following formula 
 A is equal to B 
 B is equal to C 
But A is not equal to C 
Uh an analogy of this mathematical contridiction may be
 described in the following way 
Suppose we have a whole spectrum of different shades of
colours say red anything arranged in order 
of lightness of or the percentage of the redness 
The change in two consecutive shades is so minute and
gradual that even a trained eye can not distinguish them 
If S one S two S three are three
neighbouring shades then S one cannot be separated
from S two nor can S two from S three
 
However S one can be separated from
 S three 
And in this sense S one is equal to 
S two S two is equal to S three
 but S one is not equal to S three
 
Finally I talked of Bonkare paradox 
This is an ancient paradox 
Also know as a paradox of a lier 
 Etimonised Etimonised who himself a
 Cretin says that all cretin are liers 
Now if Etimonised statement is true then being a
lier himself his statement is fuzz 
On the other hand if his statement is fuzz then he not being a
lier may say true statement 
Thus the statement is true if and only if it is fuzz 
These paradoxes are the results of our attempt to put in
precisely expressed concepts into the rigour of Aristotlian logic 
The classic case of fitting a square pet in the round hole
Naturally there is an unbridgeable gap between the two
The deductive method that we employ to derive theorems in
mathematics and logic is based on the following three basic Aristotlian
laws 
 Law of Identity 
 A proposition is what it is or in symbols 
 S is X 
The second law Law of Excluded Middle 
 A proposition is either true or false X
 is either Y or not Y
 
 The Law of Contridiction 
No proposition can be both true and false X
 can not be Y and not Y
 
Just as in a soap opera a character is all good or all bad we
have in our above logic either whole truth or the whole untruth
There is no room for partial truth 
For this reason Aristotlian logic is called two valued logic
