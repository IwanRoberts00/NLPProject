the power of yen 
""
So 
""
""
Uh having said that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
unable to 
""
But I think I am going to think of it  what I would have
""
""
I am going to cover  in these two
""
""
The first topic 
""
""
literature 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
scholar  to have collected a degree in the United States of America
""
Pennsylvenia  had
uh  on Indian writing in English
""
""
to be  I wanted to
pursue  my research
""
But uh  in the department itself there was a good deal of
""
""
""
""
writing or uh  writing and ultimately
Iyengar thought that Indian writing in English 
""
""
And Raghavacharlu introduced American literature
""
So we belong to the first generation of students who were exposed
""
""
And surprisingly we also had the  every
""
""
""
""
""
what we had done was to  various aspect
""
""
""
""
""
And there was a confluence of influence  between the political
happenings and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
path 
acquired a particular  in the year eighteen
hundred and thirty  delivered that
""
even it is cool  uh which
was later on come to be known as American  speech
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
passage to India  new world
""
""
""
""
""
King Ferdinand to undertake this uh  trip
""
And uh  formed the source
""
 even the name of the person who discovered America had been
""
""
His name is Christopher Columbus 
""
Christopher meaning Christ bearer  Columbus meaning the person
""
""
""
discovering America  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
says that uh  uh Plymouth
""
things would have been much better there won't have been any genocides of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
concerned mainly because of the radical differences of perception 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
consequence of this  Calvanistic street
""
They  the founding of America was a new
""
""
and Herzegovina  gave rise to the first world war
""
forces which resulted in  the beginning of the First World War
""
""
would spread all over Europe and who knows  the Third World War might
""
""
""
""
""
Puritans
""
""
 and all these things
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
mainly because they thought that uh  uhm the discovery of America opened
up possibilities  one
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
After uh Jesus  got back the Paradise that was lost because of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
opportunity for the redemption of mankind
""
So  in the
early American literture
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And it was transmiter  but then it represented the new
""
""
""
 Whitman
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
writing a particular variety of English employed many of their literary
""
""
""
""
""
But the great  Mark
""
""
 one normally says that Mark Twain is the
""
""
""
happened in politics  and what happens in literature here
""
""
""
""
president of the United States of America  Washington is modelled after
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
one call Lincoln  a person built on the classical mode
""
He had 
homespun  but then there was a certain dignity
""
 and the
""
""
So  balance of power
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of uh  America
""
Whereas  they came from the old
""
""
""
""
""
America was still expanding westward California had to be populated
""
""
The so called resting movement had not taken place by that time
""
""
And uh  became the president
possibly the most important president  in the United States of America who
""
""
""
""
rooted in  the indigenous genius of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
after  particularly in Bengal I have been
""
whether it is well received or not 
""
""
British Raj  simultaneous movement of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
various other religious sources  in order to bring about meaningful
""
""
""
 various other irrational
""
""
So  revival of

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And as a concequence they started a movement known as the

""
our own reformation 
""
""
""
So these  speak Tilak Ranade Gokhale
""
 Pune
""
""
in Hinduism and they wanted to rationalise an ancient religion  and of
course later on  we had people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa although he was
totally illiterate  were Christ like
