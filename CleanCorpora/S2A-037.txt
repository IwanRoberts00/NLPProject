Uh prof Deshpande  this particular
course in English of the  Academic Staff college Marathawada University
""
""
Professor Deshpande of course  apply
cosmetics 
""
And he was praising many of the things which I don't deserve  to
the power of yen 
""
So 
pinch of salt if not with a ton of salt 
""
Uh having said that 
I wanted to become  of the Marathwada
University  non-teaching employee of a non- Agricultural
University 
""
So 
""
And uh  and
uh as a consequence I am here  trying to discuss things with you share
some of my thoughts with you 
""
But anyway it gives me a lot of pleasure  to meet many of my old
students and old friends in this congregation 
""
Although I had initially promised to  of a
 seven hours in a weeks time unfortunately because of various factors I am
unable to 
""
But I think I am going to think of it  what I would have
normally spoken in seven hours in just two lecturing units 
""
I am going to cover  in these two
lectures
""
The first topic 
Conventions in American Literature  by the
various Fictual concepts  that are employed in any discussion of American
literature 
""
Now  comparative frame
of uh  and American
literature 
""
I fondly recall  that both these topics were introduced at my
old Alma mater Andhra University way back in the year nineteen hundred and
sixty-two 
""
That was the year when 
scholar  to have collected a degree in the United States of America
professor Raghavacharalu had come back with a Ph D from the University of
Pennsylvenia  had
uh  on Indian writing in English
""
So these two streams  came to a head and we were very fortunate
to be  I wanted to
pursue  my research
""
But uh  in the department itself there was a good deal of
discussion  about Indian writing in English
""
Even the topic itself 
they were toying with the idea of  employing the term Indian English
writing or uh  writing and ultimately
Iyengar thought that Indian writing in English 
descriptive and proper
""
And Raghavacharlu introduced American literature
""
So we belong to the first generation of students who were exposed
to these two 
""
And surprisingly we also had the  every
fourth year  so easy
for  people belonging to the various science faculty to display all their
technological wonder and innovation
""
But then  so
what we had done was to  various aspect
of American literature  Indian writing in English and we had drawn various
charts 
""
And 
""
And there was a confluence of influence  between the political
happenings and 
development 
""
A crucial periods of time  remarkable text was produced that was
the end result of our own  research
""
I wish I had kept an old copy of uh that visual display 
""
And one would notice that in many respects  development
and the growth of Indian writing in English  American
literature seems to have taken  a particular
configuration which is comparable 
""
And uh  you would notice that uh
 they
were given the necessary  mainly because of the famous
minutes 
""
And uh  you would
notice that uh  the usable
path 
acquired a particular  in the year eighteen
hundred and thirty  delivered that
famous 
even it is cool  uh which
was later on come to be known as American  speech
""
And now a days everybody come to this  this particular speech
delivered by  the literary declaration of independence
""
""
So  the importance that they give
""
So  the time sequence
 comparable although
America was  discovered technically within course because we are
celebrating  the discovery of America
""
Columbus  fourteen
hundred and ninety-two perhaps in the month of uh 
precisely on August sixth 
""
And uh  basic thing he was in search of a
passage to India  new world
""
""
And uh  the
literature was in the  of uh letters addressed to relatives
friends back home  in Portugal and in Spain because he was commissioned by
King Ferdinand to undertake this uh  trip
""
And uh  formed the source
of American literature but uh  most patriot Americans would like to claim
 even the name of the person who discovered America had been
rather Portugal 
""
His name is Christopher Columbus 
""
Christopher meaning Christ bearer  Columbus meaning the person
who illuminates column  light
""
So this is symbolically  speaking Christopher Columbus
discovering America  the
forces of darkness 
the significance of Columbus discovering America 
""
And uh the  later immigration took place in the early part of
the seventeenth century 
compact 
""
Apart from various jokes that are bandit about  one of the joke
says that uh  uh Plymouth
rock if the Plymouth were to land on the pilgrims  uh
things would have been much better there won't have been any genocides of
Indians in America  not to speak of the genocide that was committed in
Vietnam etcetera etcetera
""
Atleast the ugly Americans  would have been saved the image of
the ugly  Americans
""
So apart from these things one uh  perception about
the influence of religion  uh in so far as the American writing is uh
concerned mainly because of the radical differences of perception 
religious differences the interness and battles particularly between  the
Puritans and the Anglicans 
""
In England  the
immigration to America took place and  the initial writing was broadly
conditioned by these uh 
""
Uh the Calvanistic street became very very important  and as a
consequence of this  Calvanistic street
""
They  the founding of America was a new
opportunity for mankind  Europe had become totally
corrupt and 
and Herzegovina  gave rise to the first world war
because uh  that released various
forces which resulted in  the beginning of the First World War
""
And people are worried  ethnic strife
would spread all over Europe and who knows  the Third World War might
start from this particular cockpit  in Europe
""
Now  uh
refered in the broad denominational fight that took place all over Europe
between the Anglicans  who were one variety of uh Catholics and this
Puritans
""
And uh 
 and all these things
they percolated into the general psyche of uh  the American immigrant
there
""
And initial literature  uh this
sort of a 
conflict and strife  okay
""
We have uh  to establish
mainly because they thought that uh  uhm the discovery of America opened
up possibilities  one
word 
""
Because uh after  over a period
of time man has succumbed to evil forces 
""
Wherever man goes he carries the seeds of evil with him 
""
Man is corrupt and whatever he touches  is corrupted
""
So this was the broad belief  instead of the new
Maseih  the image of the new garden of Eden
""
""
After uh Jesus  got back the Paradise that was lost because of
stone passion crusification and sacrifice  here was another great
opportunity so they wanted to transform America into a new  garden of Eden
""
So this was the bold  in
America they thought there was a glorious opportunity for a new beginning 
""
So all the literature reflect the search of perception 
""
A new opportunity and with an advance fall with 
until a greater man redeemed us 
Jes  has not helped us
""
Now  they thought that America is going to provide another
opportunity for the redemption of mankind
""
So  in the
early American literture
""
Now  we had the
transcendentalist presenting their own point of view particularly uhm 
Thoreau and uh 
becomes a very crucial part of 
""
And one notices that after eighteen thirty  American literature
""
""
Whitman was not trying to immitate  he
had established a native idiom  and his rhetoric was filled with the
ringing world  that the Americans had employed
""
And it was transmiter  but then it represented the new
democratic 
""
So this is reflected in the 
 Whitman
""
I mean as though  it appears as though Whitman was just waiting
for somebody  he could publish
all his poetry 
there also one notices that the contemporary  Whitman
particularly Hawthorne  deep study
of Elizabethan literature the Renaissance 
writing a particular variety of English employed many of their literary
devices 
""
They were still tied to the apron string  of most of the
English  writer
""
But the great  Mark
Twain
""
 one normally says that Mark Twain is the
Lincoln 
""
We have uh  a conferable frame of reference between what
happened in politics  and what happens in literature here
""
I wanted to 
""
If anybody has seen the picture of uh  the first
president of the United States of America  Washington is modelled after
the classical pattern
""
He looks like one of those great Roman Senators wearing a show
guard  as though it is chiselled in
marble 
""
But when you come to Lincoln  by no stretch of imagination would
one call Lincoln  a person built on the classical mode
""
He had 
homespun  but then there was a certain dignity
""
 and the
writings of Mark Twain 
""
So  balance of power
 from the tide water region of
America that is the east coast  the
New England region to the interior of America the river  the Mississippi
Missouri river
""
So  Lincoln came from Ohio
""
He spent most of his time  in that particular region the heart
of uh  America
""
Whereas  they came from the old
aristocratic patricians families of Virginia or  New York
""
So in political terms balance of power has shifted from  the New
England region to the heart of  America
""
America was still expanding westward California had to be populated
""
""
The so called resting movement had not taken place by that time
""
""
And uh  became the president
possibly the most important president  in the United States of America who
""
emancipation of the Negros also  took place
""
So all these things gave rise to  a particular culture that was
rooted in  the indigenous genius of
the Americans 
""
So in literature and in politics this sort of a influence  is uh
discernable
""
And uh  a similar thing happening because I
started uh  our
own uh uh literature that is written in English 
after  particularly in Bengal I have been
pressing this thesis I don't know whether  acceptable or
whether it is well received or not 
""
In  provinces of the
British Raj  simultaneous movement of
uh what I call as uh 
""
Renaissance in literature  religious aspects
""
""
Mainly because uh people like Raja Ram Mohan Roy  and the other
""
consciously they thought many of the good things from Christianity and from
various other religious sources  in order to bring about meaningful
transformation of Hinduism 
""
What were the uhm  uh inadequacies of Hinduism
 various other irrational
forms of worship
""
So  revival of
interest in the ancient glories 
to bring about Reformation took place there 
""
Initially many of them underwent conversion to Christianity
""
But then  residuely good
""
""
And as a concequence they started a movement known as the 
Brahmo Samaj 
""
There are three movements which could be considered as  part of
our own reformation 
""
""
""
So these  speak Tilak Ranade Gokhale
etcetera were all  Prarthana Samaj
 Pune
""
So they were acutely conscious of uh 
in Hinduism and they wanted to rationalise an ancient religion  and of
course later on  we had people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa although he was
totally illiterate  were Christ like
