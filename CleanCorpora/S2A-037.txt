Uh prof Deshpande the coordinator for this particular
course in English of the Academic Staff college Marathawada University
 prof Shastri visiting professor here and my friends 
Professor Deshpande of course uh was attempting to apply
cosmetics to many of the short comings that I possess 
And he was praising many of the things which I don't deserve to
the power of yen 
So you've got to take everything that he says with a 
pinch of salt if not with a ton of salt 
Uh having said that uh God only knows how desperately 
I wanted to become what uh the standard coach of the Marathwada
University says as a non-teaching employee of a non- Agricultural
University laughter 
So that's what I wanted to become 
And uh unfortunately various development took place and
uh as a consequence I am here trying to discuss things with you share
some of my thoughts with you so that's the background 
But anyway it gives me a lot of pleasure to meet many of my old
students and old friends in this congregation 
Although I had initially promised to uh lecture to you of a
 seven hours in a weeks time unfortunately because of various factors I am
unable to meet you for this uh duration 
But I think I am going to think of it what I would have
normally spoken in seven hours in just two lecturing units 
I am going to cover most of the things in these two
lectures
The first topic would be on the Broad Fields and 
Conventions in American Literature and it would be followed up by the
various Fictual concepts that are employed in any discussion of American
literature 
Now to start with let me establish a comparative frame
of uh reference between Indian writing in English and American
literature 
I fondly recall that both these topics were introduced at my
old Alma mater Andhra University way back in the year nineteen hundred and
sixty-two 
That was the year when one of the earliest of one word 
scholar to have collected a degree in the United States of America
professor Raghavacharalu had come back with a Ph D from the University of
Pennsylvenia and my old teacher professor Shrinivas Iyengar had
uh written a pioneering book on Indian writing in English
So these two streams came to a head and we were very fortunate
to be students and that was the year when I graduated and I wanted to
pursue my research
But uh in the department itself there was a good deal of
discussion about Indian writing in English
Even the topic itself had become controversial debatable 
they were toying with the idea of employing the term Indian English
writing or uh Indo- Anglican or Anglian uh writing and ultimately
Iyengar thought that Indian writing in English would be broadly 
descriptive and proper
And Raghavacharlu introduced American literature
So we belong to the first generation of students who were exposed
to these two streams 
And surprisingly we also had the a sort of exhibition every
fourth year the University organises an exhibition it's so easy
for people belonging to the various science faculty to display all their
technological wonder and innovation
But then for students of literature what can they do so
what we had done was to graphically visually represent various aspect
of American literature Indian writing in English and we had drawn various
charts 
And I still remember uh we drew a X axis and a Y axis 
And there was a confluence of influence between the political
happenings and the li literary 
development 
A crucial periods of time remarkable text was produced that was
the end result of our own research
I wish I had kept an old copy of uh that visual display 
And one would notice that in many respects the development
and the growth of Indian writing in English and that of American
literature seems to have taken a broad pattern a particular
configuration which is comparable 
And uh if you go to the beginning you would notice that uh
 the elements of Indian writing in English were triggered off they
were given the necessary one word mainly because of the famous
minutes of Lord Macaulay in the year eighten hundred and thirty-five 
And uh if you are student of American literure you would
notice that uh we normally divide American literature into the usable
path and the the vibrant American literature which uh 
acquired a particular shape and a dimension in the year eighteen
hundred and thirty particularly when uh uh Emerson delivered that
famous speech addressed the Phi Betta Kappa association of Howard 
even it is cool the speech which is one word on uh which
was later on come to be known as American scholar speech
And now a days everybody come to this this particular speech
delivered by Emerson as uh the literary declaration of independence
So that's the importance that they give
So one notices that uh in terms of uh the time sequence
 the growth and uh progress they're comparable although
America was discovered technically within course because we are
celebrating the quincentenary year of the discovery of America
Columbus reached the shores of America in the year fourteen
hundred and ninety-two perhaps in the month of uh August and uh 
precisely on August sixth 
And uh you know the basic thing he was in search of a
passage to India and then he discovered a passage to the new world
And uh in the initial stages of course most of the
literature was in the nature of uh letters addressed to relatives
friends back home in Portugal and in Spain because he was commissioned by
King Ferdinand to undertake this uh trip
And uh this sort of a epistolary exercise formed the source
of American literature but uh most patriot Americans would like to claim
 that uh even the name of the person who discovered America had been
rather Portugal 
His name is Christopher Columbus 
Christopher meaning Christ bearer Columbus meaning the person
who illuminates column that's the unit which measures light
So this is symbolically speaking Christopher Columbus
discovering America established the influence of light over the
forces of darkness that's how they symbolically tried to explain 
the significance of Columbus discovering America 
And uh the later immigration took place in the early part of
the seventeenth century uh particularly with the myth lover 
compact and uh the pilgrims landing on the Plymoth rock 
Apart from various jokes that are bandit about one of the joke
says that uh instead of the Pilgrim father landing on the uh Plymouth
rock if the Plymouth were to land on the pilgrims one word uh
things would have been much better there won't have been any genocides of
Indians in America not to speak of the genocide that was committed in
Vietnam etcetera etcetera
Atleast the ugly Americans would have been saved the image of
the ugly Americans
So apart from these things one uh has a perception about
the influence of religion uh in so far as the American writing is uh
concerned mainly because of the radical differences of perception 
religious differences the interness and battles particularly between the
Puritans and the Anglicans 
In England it's one word over and uh the
immigration to America took place and the initial writing was broadly
conditioned by these uh denominational cause 
Uh the Calvanistic street became very very important and as a
consequence of this one word Calvanistic street
They thought that the founding of America was a new
opportunity for mankind it's uh Europe had become totally
corrupt and therefore people are saying what is happening in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina and Sarajevo which gave rise to the first world war
because uh Archduke Ferdinand was killed and uh that released various
forces which resulted in the beginning of the First World War
And people are worried that one word ethnic strife
would spread all over Europe and who knows the Third World War might
start from this particular cockpit in Europe
Now the root of uh the migration towards America uh
refered in the broad denominational fight that took place all over Europe
between the Anglicans who were one variety of uh Catholics and this
Puritans
And uh they believed in the Calvanistic dictum of 
 determin determinism and all these things
they percolated into the general psyche of uh the American immigrant
there
And initial literature in America is conditioned by uh this
sort of a uhm shall we say denominational and uh religious 
conflict and strife okay
We have uh various Calvanist fighting it out to establish
mainly because they thought that uh uhm the discovery of America opened
up possibilities of man going back to the condition of the pre one
word had 
Because uh after the saviour redeemed mankind over a period
of time man has succumbed to evil forces 
Wherever man goes he carries the seeds of evil with him 
Man is corrupt and whatever he touches is corrupted
So this was the broad belief and uh instead of the new
Maseih America itself provided the image of the new garden of Eden
After uh Jesus got back the Paradise that was lost because of
stone passion crusification and sacrifice here was another great
opportunity so they wanted to transform America into a new garden of Eden
So this was the bold possibilities that they envisaged in
America they thought there was a glorious opportunity for a new beginning 
So all the literature reflect the search of perception 
A new opportunity and with an advance fall with two words 
until a greater man redeemed us but even the sacrifice of 
Jes of Jesus has not helped us
Now they thought that America is going to provide another
opportunity for the redemption of mankind
So generally one notices this sort of a reflection in the
early American literture
Now thereafter one notices that uh we had the
transcendentalist presenting their own point of view particularly uhm 
Thoreau and uh Emerson but the speech that I was refering to 
becomes a very crucial part of the growth and development 
And one notices that after eighteen thirty American literature
 acquired a new vibrancy of its own where people like Whitman 
Whitman was not trying to immitate the Romantic poets he
had established a native idiom and his rhetoric was filled with the
ringing world that the Americans had employed
And it was transmiter but then it represented the new
democratic America 
So this is reflected in the Leaves of Grass 
 and in the Poetry of uh Whitman
I mean as though it appears as though Whitman was just waiting
for somebody to give the green signal so that uh he could publish
all his poetry without much of uh innovation and uh 
there also one notices that the contemporary of uh Whitman
particularly Hawthorne and Melville because of their deep study
of Elizabethan literature the Renaissance period they started uh 
writing a particular variety of English employed many of their literary
devices which uh had become important in the whole world 
They were still tied to the apron string of most of the
English writer
But the great divide occurs when it comes to Walt uh Mark
Twain
 That's why one normally says that Mark Twain is the
Lincoln of American literature 
We have uh a conferable frame of reference between what
happened in politics and what happens in literature here
I wanted to notice that one 
If anybody has seen the picture of uh Washington the first
president of the United States of America Washington is modelled after
the classical pattern
He looks like one of those great Roman Senators wearing a show
guard and even the face is so impressive as though it is chiselled in
marble 
But when you come to Lincoln by no stretch of imagination would
one call Lincoln a person built on the classical mode
He had none of the Gracian features he was uh 
homespun and homely and but then there was a certain dignity
 It's like the writings of Melville and the
writings of Mark Twain 
So even in politics one notices that the balance of power
 to use a jaded expression had shifted from the tide water region of
America that is the east coast the Applachian mountains and the the
New England region to the interior of America the river the Mississippi
Missouri river
So Lincoln came from Ohio
He spent most of his time in that particular region the heart
of uh America
Whereas the earlier presidents they came from the old
aristocratic patricians families of Virginia or New York
So in political terms balance of power has shifted from the New
England region to the heart of America
America was still expanding westward California had to be populated
 the gold rush had to take place later on 
The so called resting movement had not taken place by that time
And uh one notices that Lincoln became the president
possibly the most important president in the United States of America who
 brought about lots of changes and the civil war took place and uh 
emancipation of the Negros also took place
So all these things gave rise to a particular culture that was
rooted in the uhm genius of the people the indigenous genius of
the Americans 
So in literature and in politics this sort of a influence is uh
discernable
And uh one would notice a similar thing happening because I
started uh refering to Indian writing in English when you come to our
own uh uh literature that is written in English one notices that uh 
after Macaulay's Minute particularly in Bengal I have been
pressing this thesis I don't know whether uh it's acceptable or
whether it is well received or not 
In Bengal which is one of the oldest provinces of the
British Raj one notices that there is a simultaneous movement of
uh what I call as uh both the Reformation and the Renaissance 
Renaissance in literature Reformation in religious aspects
Mainly because uh people like Raja Ram Mohan Roy and the other
 who are acutely conscious of the decadent aspects of Hinduism 
consciously they thought many of the good things from Christianity and from
various other religious sources in order to bring about meaningful
transformation of Hinduism 
What were the uhm inseparable uh inadequacies of Hinduism
 Sati child marriages and various other irrational
forms of worship
So one notices that uh this sort of a revival of
interest in the ancient glories coupled with the conscious approach 
to bring about Reformation took place there 
Initially many of them underwent conversion to Christianity
But then they wanted to retain what ever was residuely good
 in Hinduism 
And as a concequence they started a movement known as the 
Brahmo Samaj 
There are three movements which could be considered as part of
our own reformation Brahmo Samaj in Bengal 
 Arya Samaj in erstwhile Punjab undivided Punjab 
 Prarthana Samaj based in Pune 
So these I mean I'll speak Tilak Ranade Gokhale
etcetera were all associated with the Prarthana Samaj
 based in Pune
So they were acutely conscious of uh various defeciency 
in Hinduism and they wanted to rationalise an ancient religion and of
course later on we had people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa although he was
totally illiterate many of the things that he spoke were Christ like
