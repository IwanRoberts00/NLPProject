Mr Vice Chancellor Mr Narayana Rao distinguished
members of the faculty ladies and gentlemen 
You know the great advantage of being Chief Election Commissioner of
India is that in the last few days and a last few months I have been
able to achieve life long ambitions 
Only last week I achieved the life long ambition of entering into
the Stella Mary's college in Madras laughter 
And today I have achieved the ambition of getting into the
Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages 
A kind of place of education academics and learning 
which would normally frown upon any bureaucrats much more a bureaucrat
whose name is synonymous with controversy 
The Vice Chancellor has been good enough or bad enough not to
give me a subject laughter 
In the trade which I follow once I get hold of the mike you
don't let go off it easily 
So if I don't let go off the mike Kamal Narayan will show me
some little symbols to show that it is getting late and that his blood
pressure is rising laughter 
Mr Narayana Rao gave you an introduction about myself
He said many nice things he said so many nice things that I thought
he was describing somebody else laughter 
He didn't tell you that I wrote the S S L C exam what used to be
the end of school exam twice laughter and applause 
He did not tell you that I wrote what in those days days the plus
two exam used to be called the Intermediate I wrote that twice 
laughter 
And when K Subramaniam taught me English at the Madras Christian
College in March Nineteen fifty-one I wrote the English preliminary exam
for the Physics honors twice laughter 
So how can you invite a person of this kind of academic
qualification to the most outstandingly academic circmustances of the
Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages
No no no I forgot to tell you I wrote those exams twice each
year because the question papers had leaked laughter and
applause 
Nineteen nineteen forty-seven was the first time the S S L C
queation papers leaked in Madras 
Nineteen forty-nine was the first year in which the
Intermediate question papers leaked in Madras
Nineteen fifty was the first time when a honors degree
preliminary examination question paper be it English or something else
 leaked in Madras 
So I wrote most of them twice
I am not going to tell you my academic abilities because they
are part of the history of an extinguished Civil Servant 
I have been in bonded labour with government for thirty-six years
from April nineteen fifty-five till December of Nineteen ninety when 
in a moment of extraordinary carelessness the then Prime Minister put
me into this job despite the warning laughter of a previous
Prime Minister who said this gentleman will still live to rule the day they
make you Chief Election Commissioner 
He did 
He did 
Roughly two and half years later speaking on the floor of
Parliament in February ninety-two Mr Chandrasekhar the former Prime Minister
said I've done many serious mistakes in my life
none has been so serious as the appointment of Mr Seshan as the Chief
Election Commissioner laughter and applause 
I have a feeling that Mr Chandrasekhar's feeling
towards me are slightly less frozen now because more recently I have
noticed the sign of thaw 
You basically are a set of teachers teachers and 
teacher's teachers and teacher's teacher's teachers
And who am I to speak to you about ?
What am I to speak to you about ?
The Vice Chancellor to some degree and Mr Narayan Rao to a
greater degree spoke of India and its democracy 
When you talk of India's democracy you can hold your
head up in great pride and say Where else in the world do
you get the democracy of this kind 
On the first of July last about two three months ago India's
 population was nine hundred and nineteen million people 
Of that about a five hundred and fifty million were voters above
the age of eighteen
Anybody who is above the age of eighteen who is an Indian citizen
 who is not a confirmed lunatic and who has not been declared disqualified
by some law is entitled to be a voter and he is entitled to be a
voter in a particular place if he is ordinarily resident in that place
That is what the law says 
The law was not passed by me it was passed in nineteen fifty
 when I was still studying Physics 
When we run a full national election in this country we run the
election in eight hundred thousand polling booths man by four million
civilian employees at the rate of five per polling booth
 We're going to shortly make it six 
Why are you suddenly increasing it five to six ?
Because we are going to have compulsorily atleast one woman
polling officer in each booth 
So that Mr Lalu Yadav who told the T V last week only 
He said in Hindi laughter who will be a lady 
 laughter 
And Mr Lalu Yadav will not be unhappy 
So I was saying We use four million employees in addition
to that we use a million and half policemen outside all kinds of
policemen state policemen state armed policemen state reserved policemen 
uh state home guards policemen state every kind of policemen central
policemen central reserve police border security force Indo-Tibetan border
police central Industrial security force Railway protection force 
laughter any number of forces we use one and half million policemen
to run a full election in this country 
When parliament run its election in nineteen ninety-one a few
months after I became the Chief Election Commissioner we had nine
thousand candidates for five hundred and odd parliamentary seats 
But what an average of about eighteen candidates per seat there
were some seats in which there were even a hundred candidates were 
per constituency 
In one part of India not necessarily for a parliament seat for an
assembly seat in Tamil Nadu at a place called Araba Puruchi we had three
hundred and seventy candidates for the assembly seat
So that the ballet did not look like a sheet out of India's
 todays newspaper it looked like todays edition of the newspaper
 laughter 
When parliament election runs in a normal course if there are nine
thousand candidates we consume twenty thousand tons of high quality paper
 and to each and every polling booth we reach seventy-five items like
Alice in Wonderland of ships and shoes and sealing wax of cabbages and
things of why the sea is boiling lots of ballet boxes and ballet papers
and sealing wax and the melting wax and wires and threads and uh all
kinds of things hurricane lantern if the Andhra Pradesh electricity board
to switch off electricity don't worry I can reach you without benefit of mike
 laughter 
Seventy-five items are reached to everyone of this places not all
of them are easily accessible to motorise transport there are places
where only the camel can reach as in Jaisalmer or in Bahmer or in Sawai
Madhavpur 
There are places like not only in Ladakh or Kargil but
also in Lahore and Spity where only the largest helicopter of the
Indian force the mig twenty-five can reach those polling booths with
the polling party and the polling material
There are parts of the Sunderban's jungle were only
elephant back will reach
There are parts of the island territories which only a boat
would reach 
And thanks to the extraordinary good arrangements made by
distinguished predecessors of mine I've had eight predecessors 
I'm the nineth Chief Election Commissioner of India 
Those arrangements are so good that they are the eighth
wonder of the world laughter 
Make no laughing statement about it 
Hold your head high 
Adult franchise was introduced at the point of time at which 
India's literacy was less than twenty percent 
Today gentlemen in-charge of education programmes in different
parts of the country put out lie after lie after lie all of governments
programmes are called crash programmes because they all crash 
laughter 
Crash programme in English education do you conduct those ?
 laughter and applause 
Crash programme in rat elimination laughter 
Every crash every programme is called ra crash programme
in malaria eradication crash programme in women's environment 
everything is called a crash programme 
But today at the end of all kinds of crash programmes literacy
amongst women in Bihar is still about four to five percent 
The Chief Minister will be angry to hear me say so
He says It is ten percent 
Doesn't matter I'll concede ten percent 
In Haryana they say It has reached thirty percent 
But brides are largely for burning still in Haryana 
In Haryana brides are largely still for burning 
If they don't produce a son they are burnt if they don't produce
dowry they are burnt 
Generally if they don't like the dau daughters-in-law they
are burnt 
First burn the daughter-in-law then ask the question 
laughter 
In their jest our fore-fathers the founding
fathers of our constitution decided to endow upon the people of this country
adult franchise that anybody who was twenty-one at that time now converted to
eighteen in the last four or five years has the right to elect the
government of this people of this country 
When you talk of India you're talking of Indian
democracy you talk of India what is the picture of India that you get
 ?
The picture of India taught to our children in our schools today
most of you are English teachers you don't know this but go and sit in
English class and the History classes whether in college or in school
are there any History teachers here ?
I hope not they will throw something at me laughter 
In fact there are twenty-five states and six union territories and
one national capital territory of Delhi there are Chief Minister and
there are air bus cabinets and eyebrow cabinets and air bus three twenty
cabinets in these places 
They teach you about the greatness of my literature in Telugu
and my literature in Tamil and my literature in Kannada and my literature
in Marathi and my literature in Gujrathi and my literature in something 
 There's hardly anybody to teach any of my children
 my literature in India 
But that is not all the history you got to teach people in
this country in bad English
If you go to the history classes Mr Ashoka dugged wells and he
builded hospitals laughter 
That is the kind of history being taught you know what is the
use of giving only the English teachers to this class what about the History
teacher who gets into the class and dictates notes saying Ashoka
dugged wells and he builded hospitals 
Justice India evoking you a feeling of an India which
made my grandfather's grandfather's grandfather look at a
little pot of water and say in Sanskrit 
That was long before somebody said Kaveri is my grandfather's
 river or my grandmother's river 
Today you and I have been taught English must be abolished
 the local language should be brought in in Hindi 
laughter and applause 
Have you taught the children of this country the greatness of this
country where there is a part of the country which get five hundred and
fifty inches of rain per year and still has drinking water problem for five
months in the year because they have rendered the total topography 
similar to my head laughter 
Do you know of Barmare and Rajasthan or Savai Madhavpur where the
annual rainfall is two inches ?
Do you know the Rann of Kuch where only the white wild ass and
the red Flemingo are available ?
Do you know the snow deserts of Ladakh where the snow leopard
alone lives ?
Do you know the rain forest of Kerala and of Arunachal where
botanical and uhm zoological diversity is at its acme of completion
 ?
Not of perfection but of completion 
What do you teach them ?
You teach them that the Kakatiyas were in Warangal and the
Chalukyas were in Badami 
Fact what lot of good it does to me to know that Kakatiya were
in Warangal and therefore Warangal University is named after Kakatiya is
that right ? laughter 
Oh fact lot of good it does to me if somebody comes and says
 What is the Kakatiya ? 
Now if I'm especially when the Doordarshan
 prouncer prounces it 
You don't know whether she is speaking English or French or what
foreign language she is speaking laughter 
Our Education system to which I shall come back which is going
to be the theme of what I want to say today is the greatest tragedy
which is available in this country today
Or in their greater tragedy there are there are any number of
tragedies in this country and those of you who're standing I
recommend warmly that you sit down otherwise you will get tired 
laughter
