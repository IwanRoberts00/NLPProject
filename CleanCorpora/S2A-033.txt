Madam  Department of
History  uh officers from the
university  different parts of
the Eastern regions  I am very
happy 
proficiency in English 
""
I am not uh myself a very proficient man in English  uh being a
student of uh mechanical engineering all throughout 
the technocrats and scientists 
""
You will say is equal to  write a two parallel lines
and it remain you see 
""
In fact uh any language 
""
You have a vocabulary  you combine
them in such a way 
""
The general concept of having proficiency in English  like a
common man you will say  uhm
difficult or  way they will say oh he is the man is very
proficient  in which you don't
follow most of the things  then you will say that he is a very learned
man we could not follow 
""
But my concept is uh I mean and I think the people will also agree
with me 
""
A man is having proficiency in any language  he is able
to convey 
""
If you are not in a position to convey your feeling  or your
thinking or your thoughts 
uh you are not 
""
So I think this type of courses  not
only for those who are doing courses in English  or uh those who have
taken  who
don't get opportunity 
done by other 
""
For example technocrats or doctors you will see  that these
technical people  say for example a doctor he will write a
prescription  otherwise
also 
""
I was very much surprised when you go to a compounder he will read
and give the appropriate medicine 
""
I was very much worried how that fellow can read and I can't read
it 
""
Then later on I don't know whether it is a fact or uh 
but somebody said  The doctor they can't write the name of the
medicine correctly  so
they just give some kind of symbol  uh dealing
with all these kinds of medicine in day today life  looking at the
prescription  they will
give you the appropriate medicine 
""
So that is the story for a technical people and you have I don't
know how you have invited me  either it is by virtue of the position I
occupy in the University  I mean unknowingly you consider me very
learned man that I can speak on any subject given to me 
""
Originally 
and I mean I was very happy  due to the simple reason that I will have
the opportunity of  people having proficiency in
English  learn how to write correct English
""
""
Anyway  a very
adverse  and uh
""
temperature uh mercury uh going up to forty-four degrees centigrade  I
think during this period itself 
""
Lot of variation in the temperature 
""
You have conducted the course  upto the satisfaction of the
participant 
uh given by  you must
I mean those who have come from outside  have faced lot
of difficulty I don't know whether you have taken them on some tour through
 uh
""
I don't know 
uh they must have taken you round  or
say Bodhgaya  tourist
interest 
""
I 
those faculty members 
""
By their presence 
they have been benefitted  will be benefitted in
the long run  uh only two and
""
""
Three weeks  week
 for this type of courses
""
""
I  the Institute
Central Institute of  selecting
Patna as one of the 
""
Normally now the concept outside the state is  Patna is a very
disturbed place  rather it is very difficult in most of the
situations to organise successfully 
""
I don't know whether it was well publicised or not  because most
of the participants are girls  students I could find
""
""
Uh so I believe it can be well publicise we can invite  teacher
 how to teach
English  ?
""
Or for that matter how to teach uhm  any
subject  ?
""
Now this English is uh  with the advent
of computer and  electronic
gadgets 
""
Actually now we have developed a language which can be understood
by a machine 
""
There  sorry
uh Sanskrit 
still there
""
Maybe  uh other
languages also 
""
But 
 to promote Hindi
or any other language 
""
Because it is a language  essential for at
least 
""
In the scientific world you can't do  with any other language
except English  in France or any other
country using some other kind of foreign language  to
write a computer programme in English 
""
So  actually mostly it is symbols
""
But even using symbol with proper grammar of the machine language
""
""
With all these words  all the participants
and congratulate 
a 
""
I am thankful  for giving me an
opportunity  scholars
 or mostly from the Eastern region
state 
""
Thank you very much
