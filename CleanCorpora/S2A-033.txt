Madam Principal Prof Surendragopal Department of
History and director I E S coaching Institute uh officers from the
university different teachers coming from different parts of
the Eastern regions students ladies and gentleman I am very
happy that the course has been organised for increasing 
proficiency in English 
I am not uh myself a very proficient man in English uh being a
student of uh mechanical engineering all throughout and as you know 
the technocrats and scientists they mostly do through symbols 
You will say is equal to we'll write a two parallel lines
and it remain you see even the same thing 
In fact uh any language is uh also a symbol 
You have a vocabulary and you use words you combine
them in such a way that it conveys your feelings 
The general concept of having proficiency in English like a
common man you will say if we get something written in a very uhm
difficult or one word way they will say oh he is the man is very
proficient or if you listen to a speech in which you don't
follow most of the things then you will say that he is a very learned
man we could not follow 
But my concept is uh I mean and I think the people will also agree
with me it's different 
A man is having proficiency in any language if he is able
to convey what he wants to 
If you are not in a position to convey your feeling or your
thinking or your thoughts then no matter which language you use 
uh you are not fulfilling your objective 
So I think this type of courses should we organised not
only for those who are doing courses in English or uh those who have
taken English as a subject but mostly for such persons who
don't get opportunity to use English uh to that extent as is 
done by other English student 
For example technocrats or doctors you will see that these
technical people even uh say for example a doctor he will write a
prescription except a few those who are very brilliant otherwise
also that you can't read the name of the medicines 
I was very much surprised when you go to a compounder he will read
and give the appropriate medicine 
I was very much worried how that fellow can read and I can't read
it 
Then later on I don't know whether it is a fact or uh not 
but somebody said The doctor they can't write the name of the
medicine correctly they will always commit a spelling mistake so
they just give some kind of symbol and a person who is uh dealing
with all these kinds of medicine in day today life looking at the
prescription that what is the disease what is the symptom they will
give you the appropriate medicine 
So that is the story for a technical people and you have I don't
know how you have invited me either it is by virtue of the position I
occupy in the University or I mean unknowingly you consider me very
learned man that I can speak on any subject given to me 
Originally I was asked to distribute the certificates only 
and I mean I was very happy due to the simple reason that I will have
the opportunity of listening to people having proficiency in
English and at least I can uh learn how to write correct English
 and increase uh some of my vocabulary 
Anyway I am very happy that inspite of a very
adverse social and political situation due to election and uh
 adverse weather condition this sweating and intense heat 
temperature uh mercury uh going up to forty-four degrees centigrade I
think during this period itself 
Lot of variation in the temperature 
You have conducted the course upto the satisfaction of the
participant as I could uh gather from the reaction survey 
uh given by to a student you have stayed here you must
I mean those who have come from outside they must uh have faced lot
of difficulty I don't know whether you have taken them on some tour through
 uh
I don't know I'm I am not aware but I I I hope 
uh they must have taken you round to the places uh like Rajgir or
say Bodhgaya or some other uh uh places of tourist tourist
interest 
I especially thanks thank uh 
those faculty members who have come from outside the state 
By their presence our students have been encouraged 
they have been benefitted and they uh will be benefitted in
the long run even the course duration was rather uh only two and
 three week 
Three weeks but a still a three week
 weeks are sufficient for this type of courses
I express my sincere thanks uh to uh the Institute
Central Institute of Foreign Language at Hyderabad for selecting
Patna as one of the centre centres 
Normally now the concept outside the state is Patna is a very
disturbed place and rather it is very difficult in most of the
situations to organise successfully uh such a course 
I don't know whether it was well publicised or not because most
of the participants are girls only few boys uh students I could find
 and mostly they are from Patna university mostly from here 
Uh so I believe it can be well publicise we can invite teacher
 actually we really need to teach teacher how to teach
English ?
Or for that matter how to teach uhm what you call any
subject ?
Now this English is uh so much essential with the advent
of computer and oth other electronic
gadgets 
Actually now we have developed a language which can be understood
by a machine if you are using mostly in uh computer side 
There a still either Hindi or English or for that uh sorry
uh Sanskrit or any other language they don't have any place 
still there
Maybe with further development we can do it uh uh other
languages also 
But inspite of all uh uh effort efforts 
 by the government or uh by other agencies to promote Hindi
or any other language we can't do away with uh uh English 
Because it is a language which is a essential for at
least scientific knowledge 
In the scientific world you can't do with any other language
except English even in Russia or uh in France or any other
country using some other kind of foreign language they've to
write a computer programme in English 
So they're actually mostly it is symbols
But even using symbol with proper grammar of the machine language
 becomes essential 
With all these words I again thank all the participants
and congratulate the student students for 
a participating in such type of course 
I am thankful to the authorities for giving me an
opportunity to be with the learned scholar scholars
 from all over the country or mostly from the Eastern region
state and the participants of the schools 
Thank you very much clapping
