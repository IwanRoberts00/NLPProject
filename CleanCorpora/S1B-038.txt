<I>
Count down to the Ayodhya climax is on 
And if you will stand for a mixed metaphor the 
 everything is about to reach a crescendo in the next 
four or five days
And we have in this panel uh Mr Soli Sorabjee a
very well known lawyer and Mr P Upendra member of Parliament
I wish we to balance the panel we also had somebody
 from the establishment and uh a member from the BJP that
could have probably made for a more more meaningful discussion 
But Soli why don't we get down to the the basic point the
legal aspect of it 
Uh the Supreme court has set certain things uh just to 
to clarify things for the viewers what is that the Supreme Court had said
 and what are the implication of what it has said ?
The Supreme Court has restrained any construction activity
 on the site 
Be it of a permanent nature or a temporary nature 
The Supreme Court has also directed that no construction
material or construction machinery should be brought at the sight 
At the same time having regard to the religious sentiments of
the people 
Having regards to the fact the sculpture about the Ram the
Supreme Court has clarified that this restraint will not prevent 
karseva in the form of singing of bhajan and
certain religious versions 
And that this part of the order the Supreme Court has emphasised
should be publicised and made clear to the kar sevak 
So that norm of the highest court of the land has prohibited and
what it is two words 
That is the net effect of the Supreme Court order as it is 
today in force
But even as you and I are talking uh there is a matter
being before the supreme court now just now yes and 
 which is which which which is on what
basically focussing on that issue
 Yes 
Well the petition is there I think you want to
know what contengency plan the state government has 
Because assuming sincerity on the part of the state government 
and assuming that they mean when they give an undertaking that they will
see that the mosque is not damaged no construction activity takes place
But the both thing they are out of hand 
Because after all all depends upon how many karsevak
 gather 
What sort of speeches are made by various leaders there ?
Suppose it leads to some kind of a frenzy or they result in a
situation thereby the supreme court order cannot be comply 
one word even despite the best efforts of the government 
Then what are the plans the government has I think that's 
the application which is being argued at the movement 
 What're the plans they have ?
How do they want to prevent any damage to the mosque
What is your reading Mr Upendra because uh Kalyan
Singh has said various things on this on this issue the chief
minister of U P ?
Uh do you get a cacophony coming out of the BJP
 camp ?
Or do you do you see a co-herent line of action being
outlined ?
No there doesn't appear to be very co-herent line of action
 even among themselves 
Uh different tones are being heard 
Apparently there is a difference of opinion also among the
 leaders of the BJP Vishva Hindu Parishad Bajrang Dal
 and others uh
As it is that must be within the Congress
 camp also I mean there must be difference of opinion
But more or less here the issue is very clear that 
the mosque should be protected and the karseva should
not be done in violation of the court's order 
This was on this side the line of action is very clear
Uhm 
But on the other side the matter has been complicated
with the supreme courts effective intervention 
And probably now the BJP the Vishva Hindu
Parishad the RSS and the others involved in this are
in a fix to decide what to do 
They can't abandoned the karseva straight away
And there has to be some action as announced by them 
Because by announcing the karseva even before
the talks have ended even before the final round of talks are over
on the November eight 
I feel they have got themselve into trouble inavoidable
trouble 
Had they waited for the final round probably this situation would
have been avoided 
And today a responsible particular leadership I have
great respect for the leaders of the BJP who are no
doubt patriots 
They are very clear minded 
And the BJP the major opposition party in
the parliament running four state governments 
For they can't turn down and say we don't uh accept the courts
order
So we'll defy the court orders 
 That's one predicament they are in 
At the same time they have to keep up their own mandate of
building the temple and going ahead with the construction 
So they're in a dilemma
Yes just now 
And two words 
Dilemma sorry one word go ahead
Yeah
Now it requires all the political sagacity on their part to
get out of the situation and uh I must say appreciate the effective
intervention of the Supreme Court 
 They've tried to save the situation both for the
government and the the the other party 
And one should take advantage of this position and wriggle
out of this situation
I don't know how they will do it in the next few days 
Do you agree with me that their intention now is to expand the
 the the whole uh arena of uh shall we say contest and now
mm Mr Advani is going to start from Kashi Kashi Vishvanath 
and I think Dr Murali Manohar Joshi is starting his Rath
Yatra from Mathura and they all converging converging in uhm
 Ayodhya on a certain date 
Is this do you think they're widening the area of
contention or is this the only uh diversionary move that they have
 ?
No they they did a lot of explaining also both for the
people and their cadres 
Uh in fact all they have to accept the supreme court orders and
turn down the uh contest and uh turn down the action 
They have to explain it to the people
Probably that is the part of is this part of their
campaign probably these people have are going round the from
the state 
But uh if you analyse the situatiion in its entirety two
years back when Mr name government fell on this very same
issue 
The main issue was how to protect the mosque and today 
the it has the problem has been extended outside the mosque 
to the land acquired by the U P U P government on which they want
to do the karseva 
But the already problem has been now uh extended to outside
the this
 Let's one word Soli the other other area
Soli there is another case before the Allahabad High Court 
On the acquisition of the land and the expectation was that a
judgement should come before the Dharam Sansad of the force
 uhm and therefore the one word 
But apparently they I they have been uh now they
are going to get the judgement only on the seventh 
 Is is is that your is that your 
understanding
 Uhm 
Well I don't know about fix case but in their acquisition
proceeding the acquisition proceedings have been challenged on the ground
that the land is not really acquired for a public purpose development of the
tourism
Uhm uhm
 It's challenged on the ground that it is for ulterior
purpose
But Syeed what I want to a
Why did they arrange that
The fact is that these orders are passed in interim
nations 
The Allahabad high court has passed this order in it gives a
decision 
And they've been one word December but it may
be soon thereafter 
So I don't see there should be any difficulty on the part of any
responsible political leader in complying with the supreme court orders
which they do not construct till that time 
And in the mean time as Upendrajee said there is a dilemma created
by their own uh uh doings and action which very well they were very
respectable way of getting out of the dilemma by complying with the
supreme court's order 
Because supreme court has announced us to its not its not
complete this of the karseva 
The karsevak's aspirations also can be
fulfill they don't feel frustrated that they have it will 
build up that they are going to karseva 
Okay have a karseva in a symbolic form 
Held in this particular manner 
My uh problem is that why does I say we do not dump the
sincerity of any of the person but suppose by their action or omissions
they allow a situation to be created whereby the protection of the mosque
may become very difficult 
What I am trying to drive at is that there is still the
responsibility on the part of the central government also to see that
the mosque is protected lest any untoward incident may lead to unleashing
of passions and argument 
 The state the state government in fact has
complained that you've been rushing in forces without taking the
state government into confidence
What is the constitutional position of that one ?
Well that it is a debatable point
Formally there was a provision in the constitution I think it
was article two fifty-seven A I may be mistaken I think it was that 
which authorise the deployment of military or other arm forces in the
state 
Now that has been deleted 
But at the same time there is another constitutional provision
which makes it the duty of the Union to protect the state against the
external aggression which is not here at all uhm uhm or
internal disturbance that also one word will know internal
distrurbance or to see that the government of the state is carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the constitution 
Now one of the provisions of the constitution certainly is that the
order of highest court has to be respected 
If you do not respect the highest court's order if you
flop the order of the supreme court then it is very arguable that you are
not carrying on in accordance to the provisions of the constitution and that
may enable the central government to take the forces
But as I said I would not like to be dogmatic about it 
But it's not a question if I can say so Syeed on
constitutional provision interpretation
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm
The whole question is to see that the whole things are very
subject matter of the dispute if I may say so is not damage or destroyed
when the decision is given 
Right
No there is another point which I want to add here 
On this very point today the Home Minister made a clarification in
the Rajya Sabha 
Uhm uhm
He said that the Utter Pradesh government was
informed of the deployment of this additional forces in the state
 
 That's why I don't think there is any scope for
controversy
No that mean it is a it's 
consent was not taken as a consent is necessary as I've said but
their one or two words really get great 
 But that a few words it's not
uh two words 
As far as that prior consent should be taken
The state government must be informed central can move its
forces wherever it want it wants 
But deployment and usage must be with the consent of the state
government 
 That's very clear 
Now the other question which you in fact did not answer 
answer fully Soli that this act interim order on the land acquisition
Now supposing this the high court says okay uh it it
was a you did acquired the land for the right purposes and we agree
with you 
Thereafter but the purpose for which the land was acquired was
tourism and religious tourism and so on and so forth
But if taking advantage of that you go ahead and do 
karseva then are you violating a court order even so ?
You know yeah the question is 
depends on the terms of the court order 
If the court order has restrained construction activity 
 uhm uhm till the decision is given then you violate the court
order if you do construction activity
 Yeah 
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm
But Syeed I think the crux of the matter is and 
that's another thing which I think we should all apply our minds to 
about why cannot the highest court either by way of a reference or under
article one thirty-eight by enlarging jurisdiction uhm 
decide that the basic issue 
Because now the controversy is narrowed 
Now the issue is a historical fact was there a temple on
the site ? 
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm
Was the temple destroyed ?
And has the mosque been built on that site after detroying the
temple ?
Because as far as I'm understood the muslim
leadership has also accepted the position that if it is established 
 uhm uhm that there was a temple and it was destroyed then the
mosque has no business to be on that place 
 Uhm uhm 
Now that's an issue which is capable of judicial
determination 
I can't understand people saying court can't decide that that
is something about religious 
We are not here trying to ask to determine the birth place of
Rama or whether he was there or not there nothing of the kind
Just a historical fact which can be established one way or the
other on the basis of evidence and 
 Now if we go back on that point
 I if last week I think it was that the whole debate
started
Whether one point reference can be made to the supreme court ?
