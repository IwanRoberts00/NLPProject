Count down 
""
And if you will stand 
""
four or five days
""
And we have  a
very well known lawyer  member of Parliament
""
I wish  the panel we also had somebody
 that
could have probably 
""
But Soli  the
legal aspect of it 
""
Uh the Supreme court 
to clarify things for the viewers  what is that the Supreme Court had said
 ?
""
""
The Supreme Court has restrained  any construction activity
""
""
Be it of a permanent nature 
""
The Supreme Court has also directed  that no construction
material or construction machinery should be brought at the sight 
""
At the same time  having regard to the religious sentiments of
the people 
""
Having regards to the fact  the
Supreme Court has clarified that this restraint will not prevent 
karseva  and
certain religious versions 
""
And that this part of the order the Supreme Court has emphasised
should be publicised and made clear to the 
""
So that norm of the highest court of the land has prohibited and
what it is 
""
That is the net effect of the Supreme Court order as it is 
today in force
""
""
But even as you and I are talking  uh there is a matter
being before the supreme court now 
 on what
basically focussing on that issue
""
""
""
""
""
Well the petition is there  want to
know what contengency plan the state government has 
""
Because assuming sincerity on the part of the state government 
and assuming that they mean when they give an undertaking  that they will
see that the mosque is not damaged  no construction activity takes place
""
""
But 
""
Because after all  karsevak
""
""
What sort of speeches are made by various leaders there  ?
""
Suppose it leads to some kind of a frenzy or they result in a
situation 
one word 
""
Then what are the plans the government has I think 
the application which is being 
""
 ?
""
How do they want to prevent any damage to the  mosque
""
""
What is your reading Mr Upendra  Kalyan
Singh has  the chief
minister of U P  ?
""
Uh  BJP
 ?
""
Or do you  being
outlined  ?
""
""
No there doesn't appear to be very co-herent line of action
""
""
Uh different tones are being heard 
""
Apparently there is a  among the
 Bajrang Dal
 uh
""
""
As it is  Congress
 I mean there must be difference of opinion
""
""
But more or less here the 
the mosque should be protected  should
not be done in violation of the 
""
This was  on this side the line of action is very clear
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But on the other side the matter has been  complicated
with the supreme courts effective intervention 
""
And probably now  the Vishva Hindu
Parishad the RSS  are
in a fix to 
""
They can't abandoned the  straight away
""
""
And there has to be some action as announced by them 
""
Because by announcing the  even before
the talks have ended  are over
on the November eight 
""
I feel they have got themselve into trouble  inavoidable
trouble 
""
Had they waited for the final round probably this situation would
have been avoided 
""
And today  I have
great respect for the leaders of the  who are no
doubt patriots 
""
They are very clear minded 
""
And the  major opposition party in
the parliament running four state governments 
""
For they can't turn down and say we don't uh  accept the courts
order
""
So 
""
""
""
At the same time they have to keep up their own mandate  of
building the temple 
""
""
So  in a dilemma
""
""
Yes just now 
""
And 
""
""
Dilemma  go ahead
""
""
Yeah
""
Now it requires all the political sagacity on their part  to
get out of the situation  effective
intervention of the Supreme Court 
""
 tried to save the situation both for the
government and the 
""
And one should take advantage of this  and wriggle
out of this situation
""
I don't know how they will do it in the next few days 
""
""
Do you agree with me that their intention now is to expand the
 and now
mm Mr Advani is going to 
and I think  Rath
Yatra  converging in uhm
""
""
Is this  widening the area of
contention or  uh diversionary move that they have
 ?
""
""
No they  both for the
people and their cadres 
""
Uh in fact all they have to accept the supreme court orders and
turn down the 
""
They have to explain it to the people
""
Probably that is the part of  their
campaign probably these people  from
the state 
""
But uh if you  two
years back when  on this very same
issue 
""
The main issue was 
the 
to the land acquired  on which they want
to do the 
""
But the already problem has been now uh  to outside
the this
""
""
 other area
""
""
Soli there is another case before the Allahabad High Court 
""
On the acquisition of the land  and the expectation was that a
judgement should come before the  of the force
""
""
But apparently  uh now they
are going to get the judgement only on the seventh 
""
""
understanding
""
""
""
""
""
Well I don't know about fix case  but in their acquisition
proceeding  the acquisition proceedings have been challenged on the ground
that the land is not really acquired for a public purpose development of the
tourism
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
 challenged on the ground that it is for ulterior
purpose
""
But Syeed what I want to  a
""
""
Why did they arrange that
""
""
The fact is that  these orders are passed in interim
nations 
""
The Allahabad high court has passed this order in it gives a
decision 
""
And  but it may
be soon thereafter 
""
So I don't see there should be any difficulty on the part of any
responsible political leader  in complying with the supreme court orders
which they do not construct till that time 
""
And in the mean time as Upendrajee said there is a dilemma created
by their own  uh uh doings and action which very well they were very
respectable way of getting out of the dilemma  by complying with the
supreme 
""
Because supreme court has announced us  to its not its not
complete this of the 
""
The  aspirations also can be
fulfill 
build up that they are going to 
""
Okay have a 
""
Held in this particular manner 
""
My uh problem is  why does I say we do not dump the
sincerity of any of the person  but suppose by their action or omissions
they allow a situation to be created  whereby the protection of the mosque
may become very difficult 
""
What I am trying to drive at is that there is still the
responsibility  on the part of the central government also to see that
the mosque is protected lest any untoward incident  may lead to unleashing
of passions and 
""
""
 the state government in fact has
complained  been rushing in forces without taking the
state government into confidence
""
What is the constitutional position of that one ?
""
""
Well that it is a debatable point
""
Formally there was a provision in the constitution  I think it
was article two fifty-seven A 
which authorise the deployment of military or other arm forces  in the
state 
""
Now that has been deleted 
""
But at the same time there is another constitutional provision
which makes it the duty of the Union to protect the state  against the
external aggression which is not here at all  or
internal disturbance  will know internal
distrurbance or  to see that the government of the state is carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the constitution 
""
Now one of the provisions of the constitution certainly is that the
order of highest court has to be respected 
""
If you do not respect the highest  if you
flop the order of the supreme court then it is  very arguable that you are
not carrying on in accordance to the provisions of the constitution and that
may enable the central government to take the forces
""
But as I said I would not like to be dogmatic about it 
""
But  not a question if I can say so Syeed on
constitutional provision interpretation
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
The whole question is to see that the whole things are very
subject matter of the dispute if I may say so  is not damage or destroyed
when the decision is given 
""
""
Right
""
""
No there is another point which I want to add here 
""
On this very point today the Home Minister made a clarification in
the 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
He said that  the Utter Pradesh government was
informed of the  deployment of this additional forces in the state
""
""
 why I don't think there is any scope for
controversy
""
""
No that mean 
consent was not taken as a consent is necessary as  said but
their 
""
""
 not
uh 
""
As far as that prior consent should be taken
""
The state government must be informed  central can move its
forces wherever it want it wants 
""
But deployment and usage must be with the consent of the state
government 
""
""
""
""
Now the other question which you in fact did not answer 
answer fully Soli  on the land acquisition
""
""
Now supposing this the high court says  it it
was  you did acquired the land for the right purposes and we agree
with you 
""
Thereafter but  the purpose for which the land was acquired was
tourism  and religious tourism and so on and so forth
""
But if 
karseva  ?
""
""
You know 
depends on the terms of the court order 
""
If the court order has restrained 
 till the decision is given then you violate the court
order if you do construction activity
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
But Syeed I think the crux of the matter is 
that's 
about why cannot the highest court  either by way of a reference or under
article one thirty-eight 
decide that the basic issue 
""
Because now the controversy is narrowed 
""
Now the issue is a historical fact  on
the site 
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Was the temple destroyed  ?
""
And has the mosque been built on that site after detroying the
temple  ?
""
Because as far as  the muslim
leadership has also accepted the position 
 and it was destroyed then the
mosque has no business to 
""
""
""
""
""
Now  an issue which is capable of judicial
determination 
""
I can't understand people saying court can't decide that  that
is something about religious 
""
We are not here trying to ask to determine the birth  place of
Rama or whether he was there or not there nothing of the kind
""
Just a historical fact  which can be established one way or the
other on the basis of evidence 
""
""
 if we go back on that point
""
 last week I think it was that the whole debate
started
""
Whether  one point reference can be made to the supreme court ?
