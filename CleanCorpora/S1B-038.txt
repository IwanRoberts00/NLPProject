Count down 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that
""
""
But Soli  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The Supreme Court has also directed  that no construction
""
""
At the same time  having regard to the religious sentiments of
""
""
""
""
karseva  and
""
""
And that this part of the order the Supreme Court has emphasised
""
""
So that norm of the highest court of the land has prohibited and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 on what
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
know what contengency plan the state government has 
""
Because assuming sincerity on the part of the state government 
and assuming that they mean when they give an undertaking  that they will
""
""
""
""
""
Because after all  karsevak
""
""
What sort of speeches are made by various leaders there  ?
""
Suppose it leads to some kind of a frenzy or they result in a
""
one word 
""
""
""
""
""
""
How do they want to prevent any damage to the  mosque
""
""
What is your reading Mr Upendra  Kalyan
""
""
""
Uh  BJP
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As it is  Congress
""
""
""
But more or less here the 
the mosque should be protected  should
""
""
This was  on this side the line of action is very clear
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because by announcing the  even before
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
have been avoided 
""
And today  I have
""
doubt patriots 
""
""
""
""
the parliament running four state governments 
""
For they can't turn down and say we don't uh  accept the courts
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  in a dilemma
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
government and the 
""
And one should take advantage of this  and wriggle
""
""
I don't know how they will do it in the next few days 
""
""
""
""
mm Mr Advani is going to 
""
""
""
""
""
contention or  uh diversionary move that they have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Probably that is the part of  their
campaign probably these people  from
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to the land acquired  on which they want
""
""
But the already problem has been now uh  to outside
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
understanding
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that the land is not really acquired for a public purpose development of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
purpose
""
But Syeed what I want to  a
""
""
Why did they arrange that
""
""
""
""
""
""
decision 
""
""
""
""
""
responsible political leader  in complying with the supreme court orders
""
""
And in the mean time as Upendrajee said there is a dilemma created
""
respectable way of getting out of the dilemma  by complying with the
""
""
Because supreme court has announced us  to its not its not
""
""
""
fulfill 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sincerity of any of the person  but suppose by their action or omissions
""
may become very difficult 
""
""
responsibility  on the part of the central government also to see that
""
of passions and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well that it is a debatable point
""
Formally there was a provision in the constitution  I think it
""
which authorise the deployment of military or other arm forces  in the
""
""
Now that has been deleted 
""
""
""
external aggression which is not here at all  or
""
""
accordance with the provisions of the constitution 
""
""
""
""
""
flop the order of the supreme court then it is  very arguable that you are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
He said that  the Utter Pradesh government was
""
""
""
 why I don't think there is any scope for
""
""
""
No that mean 
""
their 
""
""
""
uh 
""
As far as that prior consent should be taken
""
""
forces wherever it want it wants 
""
But deployment and usage must be with the consent of the state
""
""
""
""
""
""
answer fully Soli  on the land acquisition
""
""
Now supposing this the high court says  it it
""
with you 
""
""
tourism  and religious tourism and so on and so forth
""
""
""
""
""
""
depends on the terms of the court order 
""
If the court order has restrained 
""
order if you do construction activity
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But Syeed I think the crux of the matter is 
""
""
article one thirty-eight 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Was the temple destroyed  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
 and it was destroyed then the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rama or whether he was there or not there nothing of the kind
""
""
other on the basis of evidence 
""
""
 if we go back on that point
""
""
""
