""
""
So in this my  Refresher
Course 
""
Uh uh I can't do  in fact I want to give two talks on
commonwealth literature as such  you'll
""
""
And again in the  I
mean who are  wealth literature and probably
 about uh
""
""
Now  Commonwealth Literature
""
""
Now I have  seventeen September nineteen
sixty-five 
literature and language studies 
""
And  nineteenth
sixty-five 
""
But the very term Commonwealth itself 
is uh 
""
In the seventeenth century 
uh the Act of uh British parliament established  a Commonwealth company
""
uh I don't 
""
You see they called it a Commonwealth  comprising England and
all the other 
""
It it  idea
 this Commonwealth
was established 
""
And uh  the great
orator  speaks of the Commonwealth of
""
""
Then in the  some of
the colonies 
and  I mean they
 the
 or the
Queen 
""
Now  uh
now  was a
great imperial power  power over quite a number of colonies
 uh it is a very comfortable imperial power
""
""
And uh  uh
about the fact 
""
But uh  two
decades or so 
and uh 
""
And then 
and also as a result of uh  movements
""
""
So actually India  to become
free in nineteen forty-seven 
""
Then in uh fifty-seven Ghana and  in nineteen
sixty Nigeria 
 and sixty-six
Malta Zambia 
""
You see so  and
fifties and sixties 
""
And uh  because I think the the British
government was uh  apparently
 towards the colonies in
giving them freedom 
""
Uh  were were
become had become really 
""
So it was a kind of both both give and take 
""
And  the the England had very cordial
relationships 
""
And because of uh this cordiality  the the Commonwealth was born
""
""
And uh Jawaharlal Nehru as I told you is one of the great uh 
advocates of the Commonwealth of uh 
""
And uh  the concept of
Commonwealth literature came into 
""
So I gave you the date as about  sixties
""
""
Now 
all these literatures together 
""
Now one of course is  and the other is
the the common  between the colonies
and England 
""
And uh one might say  and the
English language 
""
Now to begin with I mean uh  the
Commonwealth literature  uh were uh people from Leads University as I
told you yesterday 
""
Now professor Walsh was the first person to write  a small book
on Commonwealth literature  and in the introduction to this particular
book  the central cannon of
British literature 
satellites of this 
""
You see they are smaller groups which are attached to this central
""
""
So  the Commonwealth
literature a a kind of imperial attitude 
""
It still carries imperial attitude 
uh literature as the central 
""
But uh the  the writers in the colonies of
course 
of uh Commonwealth literature 
""
Now  uh
""
""
""
Canadian
""
""
And then uh New Zealand  then Carribean
""
""
Now in Canada  uh there are about two languages one is uh
French and the other English 
""
So half of uh  one word
 so the entire
African literature  pople from
uh  ?
""
Lagose 
whatever they wrote was in immediate translate the English 
""
And then uh  as far as India is concerned as I mentioned this
morning  was represented
""
Only that literature which was written 
""
So if you look at these Commonwealth countries  we find there
are  white Commonwealth countries and coloured Commonwealth countries
""
""
There is Australia  in fact they
""
""
After all  uh the Australians and the Canadians and the the New
Zealand people 
""
And the relationship between  the cultural relationship between
England and the other  white Commonwealth countries that of
one might say 
""
And uhm  now the problem was they wanted to seek their own
identity 
""
They wanted to become Australians or Canadians and New Zealanders
""
""
So that problem 
""
Even though  he would like
to be  from the
parents 
""
You see it it is that kind of uh  development that you find in
uh 
""
But if you take the coloured countries  what are the coloured
countries ?
""
India 
""
Now 
 a kind of
protest  English
""
""
Now uh  let's
 I mean uh
Australian literature Canadian literature  or Indian writing in English
""
""
Now  under one umbrella of
uh 
""
Now each 
""
Now  have
""
nearly 
""
And actually it is in the 
that uh 
""
Now this is the first stage  the
""
""
You see the the 
in that writing you find  the British culture was the
dominant culture  was the
subordinate culture 
""
And uh  for one reason or
another yielded to the British 
""
Uh but this yielding is not uh I mean a very simple kind of an
yielding 
""
In the case of Australian literature or Canadian  you find this
there is a very simple kind of yielding because they were  uh more or
less  England and they
were staying there 
""
So before they started talking in terms of their own identity in
the beginning  or continuing the old
tradition of the British 
""
Uh  the second
phase is a very important phase
""
The second phase 
""
Now in India this love-hate relationship  uh in the
 the Gandhian period
""
""
During the Gandhian era 
uh was at the highest 
""
And the  we have great writers
during this period 
""
Any period of tension  or any period in which there is this
love-hate relationship 
""
So uh 
""
We have very great writers  uh not only they did write in
English but also in the other 
""
I mean uh 
""
And  that was a
period of Renaissance for us 
""
Even though we accepted  uh a good deal from the British
influence  the the
European forms  the one act play and
""
""
But uh still  the Indian
experience in a very 
""
And uh  the
phase  liberation
""
""
Uh that is 
""
Immediately 
and when I mean there is an attempt  ones own
identity 
and 
""
Now it is  the
development of uh colonial consciousness  we find this coming
together  under
the umbrella of 
""
Now 
that uh 
""
And the fourth phase is 
""
You see  in
a sense 
great writers  I mean can
stand on its own legs 
""
Uh  that the Commonwealth literature
 and there were there were
number of similar problems that uh  probably the
""
""
And uh 
their folklores  and uh
 uh in one way or other
""
In fact there are various ways not one way in which  they found
their own identity 
""
But uh  there there there they went in for
various strategies 
""
And once having found their own identity 
they are very confident now 
""
They are confident  has developed its
own literature  a a big body of Canadian
literature  and very large
body of uh 
""
And uh  that they
don't want to write in English any longer 
have started writing  their own tribal
languages 
""
Now uh  that
uh  the concept of Commonwealth
literature will 
""
Because 
""
There was a need for sometime  you see united we stand that
kind of attitude was there  then we did a lot of uh
 and uh number of conferences meeting
together
""
But now we find that uh  each literature has come of age and it
doesn't require the help of the others 
""
And uh  are more
differences than common points now 
""
So  now there will be
disintegration  and uh each
literature will start just as American literature became totally independent
 and
established its own identity and now they talk only of American literature
""
""
Similarly Australians have brought forth I mean big  uh uh
histories of Australian literature  the
help of  you see Commonwealth literature
""
They have  they have their great
writers like uh  the great
novelist  Cannis
Leaser or A D Hope or Judith Wright 
they're 
they've 
""
And  they have defined
their Australianess  happy with their
development 
""
And similar is the case with the Africans 
""
Now Africans during this third phase they did produce  some
great writers like uh  then
Ngugi 
""
Now Ole Soynka well he got Nobel prize  and Chinua Achibee is
all he also became a world figure  the
things fall apart 
""
And 
""
And now again their breaking up in the sense  now Ngugi say I
will no longer write in English 
""
He will write in his uh  not Swahili
but some other  it is a different name and he wants
to write in that language first 
""
And then translate from that 
""
Uh  so they are all very now very self conscious
about  and uh now
""
Commonwealth literatures 
""
And  uh
they will separate  will become part
of Indian Literature 
""
You see instead of  uh uh aligning itself with Commonwealth
literatures  Indian
literatures in other 
""
And uh  uh what would happen and
probably 
literature 
""
Now uh  uh this Commonwealth
literature was the  and
this is a very interesting phase 
""
And Africans have  back to
their 
""
And uh  is a
is a 
""
And I would like to read for example 
the way for example
