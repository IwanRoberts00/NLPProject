<I>
""
""
So in this my  Refresher
""
""
Uh uh I can't do  in fact I want to give two talks on
""
""
""
""
mean who are  wealth literature and probably
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is uh 
""
""
uh the Act of uh British parliament established  a Commonwealth company
""
""
""
""
all the other 
""
""
 this Commonwealth
""
""
And uh  the great
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
now  was a
""
 uh it is a very comfortable imperial power
""
""
And uh  uh
""
""
But uh  two
decades or so 
and uh 
""
""
and also as a result of uh  movements
""
""
So actually India  to become
free in nineteen forty-seven 
""
Then in uh fifty-seven Ghana and  in nineteen
sixty Nigeria 
""
Malta Zambia 
""
You see so  and
fifties and sixties 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  the the England had very cordial
relationships 
""
And because of uh this cordiality  the the Commonwealth was born
""
""
And uh Jawaharlal Nehru as I told you is one of the great uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now one of course is  and the other is
""
""
""
And uh one might say  and the
English language 
""
Now to begin with I mean uh  the
Commonwealth literature  uh were uh people from Leads University as I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  the Commonwealth
""
""
""
""
""
But uh the  the writers in the colonies of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Canadian
""
""
""
""
""
""
French and the other English 
""
So half of uh  one word
""
African literature  pople from
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Only that literature which was written 
""
So if you look at these Commonwealth countries  we find there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So that problem 
""
""
to be  from the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
""
""
""
""
 I mean uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now each 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this is the first stage  the
""
""
You see the the 
""
dominant culture  was the
""
""
And uh  for one reason or
""
""
Uh but this yielding is not uh I mean a very simple kind of an
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So before they started talking in terms of their own identity in
the beginning  or continuing the old
tradition of the British 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now in India this love-hate relationship  uh in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
during this period 
""
Any period of tension  or any period in which there is this
""
""
So uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  that was a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But uh still  the Indian
experience in a very 
""
And uh  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
and when I mean there is an attempt  ones own
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that uh 
""
""
""
""
a sense 
great writers  I mean can
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
their folklores  and uh
""
""
""
their own identity 
""
""
various strategies 
""
""
""
""
""
""
literature  and very large
body of uh 
""
""
don't want to write in English any longer 
""
languages 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
kind of attitude was there  then we did a lot of uh
""
together
""
""
doesn't require the help of the others 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
established its own identity and now they talk only of American literature
""
""
""
histories of Australian literature  the
""
""
They have  they have their great
""
""
Leaser or A D Hope or Judith Wright 
""
""
""
And  they have defined
""
development 
""
And similar is the case with the Africans 
""
Now Africans during this third phase they did produce  some
""
Ngugi 
""
Now Ole Soynka well he got Nobel prize  and Chinua Achibee is
""
things fall apart 
""
""
""
And now again their breaking up in the sense  now Ngugi say I
will no longer write in English 
""
He will write in his uh  not Swahili
""
to write in that language first 
""
""
""
Uh  so they are all very now very self conscious
""
""
""
""
""
""
of Indian Literature 
""
""
""
""
""
""
probably 
""
""
""
literature was the  and
""
""
""
their 
""
""
is a 
""
""
the way for example
