So in this my last talk in in this uh Refresher
Course 
Uh uh I can't do uh in fact I want to give two talks on
commonwealth literature as such but uh cough you'll
 have to be satisfied with only one 
And again in the in the department here there are people I
mean who are specialists in Common wealth literature and probably
 uh they will say something more uh concrete about uh
 Australian literature uh African literature 
Now cough uh now uh Commonwealth Literature
 when it was conceived I think sometime in the nineteen sixties 
Now I have one date here seventeen September nineteen
sixty-five uh on which an association of Commonwealth 
literature and language studies was formed 
And so that's a a good date nineteenth
sixty-five 
But the very term Commonwealth itself the term Commonwealth 
is uh quite an old one 
In the seventeenth century the seventeenth century uh 
uh the Act of uh British parliament established a Commonwealth company
 uh a a comprising English England and all the other 
uh I don't can't read in this or the other territories 
You see they called it a Commonwealth comprising England and
all the other uh dominions and territories 
It it it's a seventeenth uh century uh idea
 and uh the Ac by the Act of parliament this Commonwealth
was established 
And uh then in the eighteenth century Berk the great
orator political orator now he speaks of the Commonwealth of
 nations Commonwealth of self governing nations 
Then in the uh nineteenth century I mean the some of
the colonies like Canada and uh New Zealand and Australia 
and So South Africa I mean they
 uh became in a sense self governing nations of course under the
 uh uh rule or reign of uh the the British King or the
Queen 
Now it's in uh twentieth century that uh uh
now En England of course was a
great imperial power with a power over quite a number of colonies
 and uh to begin with uh it is a very comfortable imperial power
 enjoying its uh rule over so many uh colonies 
And uh the and the English people were very proud uh
about the fact that uh the sun never set on the British Empire 
But uh uh in in twentieth century in the first two
decades or so I mean in all the colonies there was an awakening 
and uh and the struggle for freedom uh started 
And then it is as a result of the second world war 
and also as a result of uh the the uh strong freedom movements
 in the colonies most of the colonies became free 
So actually India and Pakistan were the first to become
free in nineteen forty-seven 
Then in uh fifty-seven Ghana and Malaysia in nineteen
sixty Nigeria uh sixty-two Yuganda sixty-seven uh 
 Da Dangarika and Cyprus and sixty-six
Malta Zambia sixty-five Congo and like that 
You see so it's in the forty late forties and
fifties and sixties I mean the most of the colonies became free 
And uh so for some reason because I think the the British
government was uh uh quite ap apparently
 showed a kind of a generosity towards the colonies in
giving them freedom 
Uh though the the then freedom struggle were were
become had become really ripe 
So it was a kind of both both give and take you see 
And that's why the the England had very cordial
relationships with the colonies 
And because of uh this cordiality the the Commonwealth was born
And uh Jawaharlal Nehru as I told you is one of the great uh 
advocates of the Commonwealth of uh the British colonies 
And uh now it is at that time again the concept of
Commonwealth literature came into existence 
So I gave you the date as about early early sixties
Now uh what are the factors that uh brought 
all these literatures together 
Now one of course is the English language and the other is
the the common cultural relationship between the between the colonies
and England 
And uh one might say the colonial consciousness and the
English language have were the two binding factors 
Now to begin with I mean uh those who sort of the
Commonwealth literature uh were uh people from Leads University as I
told you yesterday 
Now professor Walsh was the first person to write a small book
on Commonwealth literature and in the introduction to this particular
book uh Walsh says speaks of uh the the central cannon of
British literature and uh these other literatures are uh 
satellites of this 
You see they are smaller groups which are attached to this central
 area of uh British literature 
So you you find in that concept of uh the Commonwealth
literature a a kind of imperial attitude 
It still carries imperial attitude and makes the British 
uh literature as the central cannon and the others its satellite 
But uh the the ca the writers in the colonies of
course they reacted very strongly against this imperial concept 
of uh Commonwealth literature 
Now uh what are the literatures that came together uh
 the Australian literature uh 
Canadian
And then uh New Zealand then African then Carribean
Now in Canada a uh there are about two languages one is uh
French and the other English 
So half of uh Canada and uh Africa one word
 Muslims uh newly educated people wrote in English so the entire
African literature a and also for some uh pople from
uh what country is it ?
Lagose you see they wrote in uh French but they 
whatever they wrote was in immediate translate the English 
And then uh as far as India is concerned as I mentioned this
morning only one tenth of our literature was represented
Only that literature which was written in English 
So if you look at these Commonwealth countries we find there
are white Commonwealth countries and coloured Commonwealth countries
There is Australia Canada New Zealand in fact they
 they they still follow the European tradition 
After all uh the Australians and the Canadians and the the New
Zealand people they are Englishmen who went and settle there 
And the relationship between the cultural relationship between
England and the other these uh white Commonwealth countries that of
one might say father and son father and son 
And uhm now the problem was they wanted to seek their own
identity 
They wanted to become Australians or Canadians and New Zealanders
So that problem was there with them 
Even though the the son as he grows up he would like
to be separate he would like to have a separate identity from the
parents 
You see it it is that kind of uh development that you find in
uh the literatures of the white uh commonwealth countries 
But if you take the coloured countries what are the coloured
countries ?
India uh and Africa and West Indies 
Now uh India for one reason or an 
 another I mean it didn't develop a a kind of
protest that Africans Africas developed towards English
 uh Eng uh England 
Now uh even though my even looking at the Indian let's
 take I mean uh each uh each literature I mean uh
Australian literature Canadian literature or Indian writing in English
 or African literature 
Now even before they came together under one umbrella of
uh Commonwealth literature 
Now each literature had developed to a certain extent 
Now uh one can say that each literature have
 has passed through nea 
nearly four phases 
And actually it is in the third phase of its development 
that uh these literatures came together under one uh umbrella 
Now this is the first stage I mean that is during your the
 the period of imperialism 
You see the the there there was this writing writing in 
in that writing you find that uh the British culture was the
dominant culture and uh the the the culture of the colonies was the
subordinate culture 
And uh the the colonies in a sense for one reason or
another yielded to the British dominant culture 
Uh but this yielding is not uh I mean a very simple kind of an
yielding 
In the case of Australian literature or Canadian you find this
there is a very simple kind of yielding because they were uh more or
less the British who had just gone away from uh England and they
were staying there 
So before they started talking in terms of their own identity in
the beginning they did enjoy this yielding or continuing the old
tradition of the British 
Uh but later on the second phase the second
phase is a very important phase
The second phase is a love-hate relationship 
Now in India this love-hate relationship begins uh in the
 uh early twentieth century with uh uh the Gandhian period
During the Gandhian era one might say this uh tension 
uh was at the highest 
And the that's the reason why we have great writers
during this period 
Any period of tension or any period in which there is this
love-hate relationship 
So uh that period is very fertile 
We have very great writers uh not only they did write in
English but also in the other uh Indian literature 
I mean uh who expressed themselves during this period 
And that's why from one point of view that was a
period of Renaissance for us in India 
Even though we accepted uh a good deal from the British
influence from from England uh we took them forms the the
European forms the novel the short story the one act play and
 uh three act play and all those things 
But uh still uh they tried to express the Indian
experience in a very intense way 
And uh during the third phase the third phase is the
phase that comes immediately after getting political liberation
Uh that is political decolonisation 
Immediately af that is followed by a third phase 
and when I mean there is an attempt to I uh seek ones own
identity uh and uh to seek ones own national spirit 
and that's how a very interesting stage of development 
Now it is a during this stage the third stage of the
development of uh colonial consciousness that uh we find this coming
together of uh uh the literatures of all these colonies under
the umbrella of uh Commonwealth literature 
Now the fourth phase comes after that say is is now 
that uh the most of these literature are in the fourth phase 
And the fourth phase is the phase of confidence 
You see now most of these literatures they have attained in
a sense their own identify and they have produced their own uh 
great writers and uh now actually each literature I mean can
stand on its own legs 
Uh so I have a feeling that the Commonwealth literature
 I mean in third phase they came together and there were there were
number of similar problems that uh uh they were facing probably the
 pha the problem of uh seeking ones own identity 
And uh almost all these literatures went back to their past 
their folklores in order to derive inspiration uh uh and uh
 uh in one way or other
In fact there are various ways not one way in which they found
their own identity 
But uh they found there there there they went in for
various strategies uh in order to uh seek their own identity 
And once having found their own identity now they they 
they are very confident now 
They are confident and the each has developed its
own literature that is they now a a big body of Canadian
literature a very large body of Australian literature and very large
body of uh Carribean literature and also African literature 
And uh now the Africans have become so conscious that they
don't want to write in English any longer and uh they've 
have started writing in their own languages their own tribal
languages 
Now uh uh I've a feel I I have a hunch that
uh gradually this uh Commonwealth the concept of Commonwealth
literature will uh disintegrate 
Because the need will go away 
There was a need for sometime you see united we stand that
kind of attitude was there and uh no then we did a lot of uh
 I mean uh comparative work and uh number of conferences meeting
together
But now we find that uh each literature has come of age and it
doesn't require the help of the others 
And uh they they there are more
differences than common points now in the fourth phase 
So I have a feeling that uh now there will be
disintegration of uh Commonwealth literature and uh each
literature will start just as American literature became totally independent
 of uh uh British literature in the nineteenth century and
established its own identity and now they talk only of American literature
Similarly Australians have brought forth I mean big uh uh
histories of Australian literature and now they don't need the
help of the the umbrella you see Commonwealth literature
They have achieved their identity they have their great
writers like uh uh Patrick White who won the Nobel prize the great
novelist and then they have very important poets like Cannis
Leaser or A D Hope or Judith Wright and again they have uh 
they're quite happy with uh their Australianess in uh 
they've achieved it 
And the they have well defined they have defined
their Australianess and uh they're happy with their
development 
And similar is the case with the Africans 
Now Africans during this third phase they did produce some
great writers like uh Chinua Achibee then Ole Soynka then
Ngugi 
Now Ole Soynka well he got Nobel prize and Chinua Achibee is
all he also became a world figure by his first novel itself the
things fall apart 
And so they have achieved their own identity 
And now again their breaking up in the sense now Ngugi say I
will no longer write in English 
He will write in his uh Kenyan it's not Swahili
but some other uh uh language it is a different name and he wants
to write in that language first 
And then translate from that into English 
Uh now uh so they are all very now very self conscious
about their Africanness or Australianess or Canadianess and uh now
 they're very few points which are common amongst all these 
Commonwealth literatures 
And that's why I've a feeling that uh
they will separate and Indian writing in English will become part
of Indian Literature 
You see instead of uh uh aligning itself with Commonwealth
literatures uh it will seek its identity with uh other Indian
literatures in other in native languages 
And uh this is in general uh what would happen and
probably what's going to happen with uh Commonwealth 
literature 
Now uh the the main problem with uh this Commonwealth
literature was the was the attempt to seek ones identity and
this is a very interesting phase 
And Africans have went gone back to
their ancient uh Gods and rituals 
And uh uh the way they went back in fact uh is a
is a is a lesson to us 
And I would like to read for example some of the things 
the way for example they went back to their gods
