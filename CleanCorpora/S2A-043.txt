One of this  in the true
""
""
So here is 
""
So that 
""
And he 
""
Shailender 
within the premises of the palace 
""
Gautama breathed  a younger prince should
have 
""
That is on the previlege within the palace 
""
The father could prepare to see  that his son never went out of
the palace 
""
Once he went out of the palace  he would naturally can't face the
scene 
""
He detected  decay and death
""
""
For about twenty or thirty-two years  not clearly
mentioned 
""
When he came of age  known as
Yashodra 
came to be 
""
Now 
""
Destiny must have its own 
""
And it it open at a proper time 
""
His trusted charioteer known as Channa  who had been instructed
by the father not to take the prince 
""
He requested Channa  let us have a ride outside the
palace 
""
Channa 
""
He reeling to his pressure 
""
He took him outside the palace 
""
Of course his  or riding
properly on a horse 
suffering 
""
Naturally Gautama asked what is this  ?
""
This is called suffering 
""
Suffering due to various causes 
psychological problems may be there 
""
But physical suffering 
""
That 
""
So he came back 
""
Taking that impression within his mind 
""
Another day  Kapilavastu
 different types of
diseases 
""
Buddha never knew what disease was 
""
So he asked his charioteer  what is this that I am
seeing 
""
This is known as 
""
People 
""
This is a second impression 
""
He comes back to palace 
""
He came over this 
""
Then after a few days again he went he went  outside on his ride
""
""
He saw an old man 
""
A new sight for him 
""
What is this  ?
""
He said it is called old age 
""
And everyone is subject to this old age 
""
The lone  old age they may be young people who
would have  from
""
then  that is the usual
procedure 
""
So this is a third impression  that
Gautama had on his mind 
""
He came back 
""
Lot of tremendous disturbance was there 
""
Seeing one after another 
""
Finally  a dead body
being carried 
""
""
""
This is called death 
""
Everyone  none can escape death
""
""
What is happen  and
there is an end of his physical body 
""
So these four impressions  oldage
""
that he went 
""
Then he 
""
I must find an answer to this 
""
How to escape 
""
Transformation  not
be every one as it called 
""
That to turning point  in the life of Buddha in the life of
Gautama 
""
Finally  leave
""
""
In search  to
humanity  of this four kinds of
""
""
That night  mahaesha
""
""
He saw his wife lying on the bed  at his
wife  who happened to be the
future prince 
""
And left 
""
It is said  to leave
everything  the Jataka stories that is the
Buddhist scriptures  of
Buddha leaving the palace 
""
There is mentioned 
""
Buddha leaves  that trusted
charioteer 
""
And once they enter the forest  dress
the princely dress the outfit the princely outfit that he had 
""
Handed them over to Channa  and
wore simple clothes 
""
This all is a very interesting anecdote 
""
Channa returning to the palace  without
Gautama 
""
But then  he had to
carry 
""
Then began 
""
Because he 
""
Then  he was about
thirty years 
""
For ten long years 
hardships  mortification of his
own body 
""
Subjected himself  physical
and mental 
""
In this context I must tell you  was not a
Buddhist 
Buddhism  probably a couple of
centuries later on after the demise of Buddha 
""
But at the time of  he then lectures in religious
schools  from that on various
""
""
So he goes to various teachers  and
subjecting himself 
""
For ten long years  only
his physical frame 
""
He was losing strength  to the
body for the maintenance of the body 
""
Then he decides  one we
refer to from first term when he was brought up on the lap of luxury  that
was one extreme 
""
So those important years 
""
Then in ten years  to extreme poverty
privation 
""
These two extreme should be avoided  that realisation came to
him 
""
In the meantime 
search of illumination  that such a feat that
passes or understanding 
""
By the time  to Buddha Gaya now it is known as
Bodhgaya 
""
He 
""
By the time he came to Bodhgaya  forty years
of age 
""
He had decided  he will give up this two extremes
""
""
Then  that is
given to us  sixth
chapter 
""
Food and recreation  should be moderated
""
""
Not over eating  hence feeling all its energy in digesting that
food 
""
We know 
how much of energy is lost 
""
You feel so lazy whole day 
""
So long back  on the same
""
""
""
Avoid all extremes  he created
in excessiveness 
""
But  a
few words in Sanskrit 
""
Even in our activity 
""
And lack of activity also should be avoided 
""
But moderation  that is the
lesson  centuries
before  the time of Buddha
""
""
""
Even in sleep  a few words in Sanskrit
""
""
This called 
""
Moderation never means  it destroys all kinds
of 
""
So by the time 
some of you may have glance for forty-five forty-three forty-four years ago
 it
has developed much later now 
""
Many new things have been added 
""
In the last century 
one word 
""
One English  it is in Bihar
 he just by chance he was escavating
something he found 
""
The tip of a brick  asked these people
to remove 
temple 
""
Here if you view 
there 
""
Whether it is the same Ashoka tree  Buddha meditated
under we do not know 
""
It cannot be because two thousand five hundred years a tree cannot
""
""
But  it has also a very these are a very
good tree 
""
So when I  a few
leaves I brought 
""
So that was again  vaisakha purnima
""
""
In the afternoon  one village dame Sujata by name brought a
little 
""
Buddha accepted it 
""
We should  she
offered that 
""
And that gave him some strength  which had
some miracle 
""
After having taken  he comes
to that Bodhi tree there was no temple at that time  only tree was there
""
""
He sat under the tree  Bodhi
vriksha 
""
Some  tree
have gone in different parts 
""
With deep determination he sat under the tree 
""
One of the most glorious  verses that I have cone across in
Sanskrit is this  with deep
resolution  he sat
under the Bodhi tree 
""
He has an hymn 
""
In this seize  and my skin bones and
flesh 
""
First a skin  let it be
destroyed 
""
 that knowledge
 it has never been
impossible 
""
Impossible means it can never be attained 
""
With a difficult  spiritual life
itself is difficult 
""
But nobody has said 
""
 for beyonds and beyonds people
have rights  until I sent that
illumination 
""
 I shall not budge an inch from
this seat 
""
This is the determination  Gautama
sat under the tree 
""
That is the story comes  marahans
 then
terror 
""
But  for any of these neither sensation nor
terror 
""
Gautama had to become Buddha  every
quarter 
became languish 
""
And by heard on  became
Buddha 
""
Buddha means the enlightened one 
""
He became fully enlightened 
""
Now after this  in the
Jataka stories 
""
Now as symbolically they have made stone  as he
came up from that seat  there was a lotus
coming under his foot 
""
Until he started going 
""
Then starts his 
""
For forty years  with the
twenty-five years happy luxurous life 
and the determination to leave everything 
""
And in search of truth for ten years  hard rigorous spiritual
practices 
""
Then again  that happen
 just exactly forty
years later 
""
Five hundred and sixty  five
hundred seventy in B C 
""
Then he went on preaching to people  about this meaningless
""
""
Because at that time  at your
 in performing
""
""
It is mentioned in the  in Sanskrit
 you have to
perform  you have
to perform sacrifice 
""
But  much later thousand year
later from Shankara  refer to Shankara also who was also
against 
""
It was more after the Upanishadic way of life 
""
Buddha also comes to the same tradition  same upanishadic
tradition
""
He was never against this Upanishadic tradition 
""
But his whole concept that is vital core  what he calls
""
""
He coined a new word 
""
In our Hindu 
Brahma nirvana vrikchse 
""
Brahma the highest knowledge 
Nirvan 
""
If attained 
because a kind of a negative concept  but Shankara gives us positive
concept  the highest
realisation 
""
So as he was  this is
one notable feature in Buddhism 
""
He made no distinction 
""
Men and women  are all accepted and became monks and nuns in
course of time 
""
Not during the time of Buddha
