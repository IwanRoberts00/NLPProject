One of this  in the true
""
""
So here is 
""
So that 
""
""
""
""
within the premises of the palace 
""
""
have 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He detected  decay and death
""
""
For about twenty or thirty-two years  not clearly
""
""
When he came of age  known as
""
came to be 
""
""
""
""
""
And it it open at a proper time 
""
""
by the father not to take the prince 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He took him outside the palace 
""
Of course his  or riding
""
suffering 
""
""
""
This is called suffering 
""
Suffering due to various causes 
psychological problems may be there 
""
But physical suffering 
""
""
""
So he came back 
""
Taking that impression within his mind 
""
""
 different types of
""
""
Buddha never knew what disease was 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is a second impression 
""
""
""
He came over this 
""
Then after a few days again he went he went  outside on his ride
""
""
He saw an old man 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this is a third impression  that
Gautama had on his mind 
""
He came back 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Everyone  none can escape death
""
""
""
""
""
So these four impressions  oldage
""
""
""
""
""
I must find an answer to this 
""
How to escape 
""
Transformation  not
""
""
That to turning point  in the life of Buddha in the life of
""
""
""
""
""
In search  to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
future prince 
""
And left 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Buddha leaves  that trusted
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This all is a very interesting anecdote 
""
Channa returning to the palace  without
""
""
But then  he had to
""
""
""
""
Because he 
""
""
""
""
""
hardships  mortification of his
""
""
Subjected himself  physical
""
""
In this context I must tell you  was not a
""
""
""
""
""
schools  from that on various
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
body for the maintenance of the body 
""
""
refer to from first term when he was brought up on the lap of luxury  that
""
""
""
""
Then in ten years  to extreme poverty
""
""
These two extreme should be avoided  that realisation came to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Bodhgaya 
""
He 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
given to us  sixth
""
""
""
""
""
Not over eating  hence feeling all its energy in digesting that
""
""
""
how much of energy is lost 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Avoid all extremes  he created
""
""
""
""
""
Even in our activity 
""
And lack of activity also should be avoided 
""
""
lesson  centuries
""
""
""
""
Even in sleep  a few words in Sanskrit
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 it
""
""
Many new things have been added 
""
In the last century 
""
""
One English  it is in Bihar
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
there 
""
Whether it is the same Ashoka tree  Buddha meditated
""
""
""
""
""
But  it has also a very these are a very
""
""
So when I  a few
""
""
So that was again  vaisakha purnima
""
""
""
little 
""
Buddha accepted it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to that Bodhi tree there was no temple at that time  only tree was there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
under the Bodhi tree 
""
He has an hymn 
""
In this seize  and my skin bones and
""
""
First a skin  let it be
""
""
 that knowledge
""
""
""
Impossible means it can never be attained 
""
With a difficult  spiritual life
""
""
""
""
""
have rights  until I sent that
""
""
""
this seat 
""
""
sat under the tree 
""
That is the story comes  marahans
""
terror 
""
But  for any of these neither sensation nor
""
""
Gautama had to become Buddha  every
quarter 
""
""
""
Buddha 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
came up from that seat  there was a lotus
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
twenty-five years happy luxurous life 
and the determination to leave everything 
""
And in search of truth for ten years  hard rigorous spiritual
""
""
Then again  that happen
""
years later 
""
""
hundred seventy in B C 
""
Then he went on preaching to people  about this meaningless
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
perform  you have
""
""
But  much later thousand year
later from Shankara  refer to Shankara also who was also
""
""
It was more after the Upanishadic way of life 
""
""
tradition
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Brahma the highest knowledge 
""
""
""
""
concept  the highest
realisation 
""
So as he was  this is
one notable feature in Buddhism 
""
""
""
""
""
""
