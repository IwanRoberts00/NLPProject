One of this that is some should know in the true
 kshatriya spirit 
So here is well provided paradise 
So that he need not had any two words 
And he could not even believe you see that is somebody 
Shailender one word life he was brought up 
within the premises of the palace 
Gautama breathed all the sin that a younger prince should
have 
That is on the previlege within the palace 
The father could prepare to see that his son never went out of
the palace 
Once he went out of the palace he would naturally can't face the
scene the stark realities of this mundane world 
He detected the suffering sickness decay and death
For about twenty or thirty-two years it's not clearly
mentioned Gautama lived secluded within the palace 
When he came of age he married a princess known as
Yashodra and he had a son also by her who became 
came to be known as Rahul 
Now Buddha was born with a mission 
Destiny must have its own course 
And it it open at a proper time 
His trusted charioteer known as Channa who had been instructed
by the father not to take the prince outside the palace premise 
He requested Channa let us have a ride outside the
palace to see the world outside 
Channa he must break away the path the life of Buddha 
He reeling to his pressure of the prince 
He took him outside the palace 
Of course his wahan a coach or riding
properly on a horse chariot was going he found some people 
suffering with intense pain 
Naturally Gautama asked what is this that I see ?
This is called suffering 
Suffering due to various causes physical mental 
psychological problems may be there 
But physical suffering is the most notable one 
That created impression on him 
So he came back 
Taking that impression within his mind 
Another day when he went around the city Kapilavastu
 he saw sickness people suffering from different types of
diseases 
Buddha never knew what disease was 
So he asked his charioteer what is this that I am
seeing ? 
This is known as sickness disease 
People are subjected to various kinds of disease 
This is a second impression that Gautama had 
He comes back to palace 
He came over this first suffering then sickness 
Then after a few days again he went he went outside on his ride
He saw an old man tottering on his walking stick 
A new sight for him 
What is this ?
He said it is called old age 
And everyone is subject to this old age 
The lone and sinister old age they may be young people who
would have a difficult match but normally people grow from
 Balavastha one word then praudha 
then old age then dehant that is the usual
procedure 
So this is a third impression old age yeah that
Gautama had on his mind 
He came back to his palace 
Lot of tremendous disturbance was there 
Seeing one after another 
Finally one day when he went out he saw a dead body
being carried to the cremation ground 
 What is this ? he asked Channa 
This is called death 
Everyone is one word died none can escape death
What is happen they should be either buried or cremated and
there is an end of his physical body 
So these four impressions suffering sickness oldage
 and death led such a strong impression on the mind of Buddha 
that he went and went back to his palace 
Then he one word his life 
I must find an answer to this 
How to escape this four-fold 
Transformation siddhant one word not
be every one as it called 
That to turning point in the life of Buddha in the life of
Gautama 
Finally one day he decides that he will leave
 his hearth and home his young wife and a new born baby Rahul 
In search of that truth which will bring solace to
humanity which will solve the problems of this four kinds of
 changes that every body is subject to 
That night when he decided is called mahaesha
 very significant word 
He saw his wife lying on the bed took a last glance at his
wife and the child Rahula also who happened to be the
future prince 
And left the palace 
It is said when Gautama took the decision to leave
everything in search of truth the Jataka stories that is the
Buddhist scriptures bore ecstacies in describing this event of
Buddha leaving the palace 
There is mentioned that God rejoiced 
Buddha leaves palace with his Channa that trusted
charioteer to the forest 
And once they enter the forest he removed all his dress
the princely dress the outfit the princely outfit that he had 
Handed them over to Channa and shaved off his hair and
wore simple clothes ordinary simple clothes 
This all is a very interesting anecdote 
Channa returning to the palace without Buddha without
Gautama 
But then that was the prince's order he had to
carry out 
Then began the search for truth 
Because he he was about thirty years of age at that time 
Then Buddh uh Gautama left his palace he was about
thirty years 
For ten long years he underwent all kinds of austerities 
hardships privations trial and humiliations mortification of his
own body 
Subjected himself to various kinds of disciplines physical
and mental 
In this context I must tell you that Buddha was not a
Buddhist in the sense that we understand him today because 
Buddhism came into existence much later probably a couple of
centuries later on after the demise of Buddha 
But at the time of Gautama he then lectures in religious
schools the various systems that we have had from that on various
 kinds prescribing various types of disciplines 
So he goes to various teachers seeking their advise and
subjecting himself to various kinds of disciplines 
For ten long years but at the end nothing happened only
his physical frame became emaciated 
He was losing strength proper food was not given to the
body for the maintenance of the body 
Then he decides this extreme two extremes one we
refer to from first term when he was brought up on the lap of luxury that
was one extreme 
So those important years he was also twenty-five years 
Then in ten years subjected to himself to extreme poverty
privation trials and humiliation the other extreme 
These two extreme should be avoided that realisation came to
him 
In the meantime he was wandering in search of truth 
search of illumination search of acknowledge that such a feat that
passes or understanding 
By the time he comes to Buddha Gaya now it is known as
Bodhgaya 
He two words 
By the time he came to Bodhgaya he was about forty years
of age 
He had decided that he will give up this two extremes
Then he followed that one better example that is
given to us in the Geeta in the sixth
chapter seventeenth verse A few words in sanskrit 
Food and recreation yukta should be moderated
 no extremes 
Not over eating hence feeling all its energy in digesting that
food 
We know our experience tells if by chance we overeat 
how much of energy is lost in digesting that food 
You feel so lazy whole day 
So long back the centuries before Buddha gave on the same
 Shri Krishna has told us in the Geeta 
Avoid all extremes A few words in Sanskrit he created
in excessiveness 
But it should be moderate avoid all extremes a
few words in Sanskrit 
Even in our activity intense activity should be avoided 
And lack of activity also should be avoided 
But moderation everything should be moderate that is the
lesson that shri Krishna has given to us centuries
before the time of Buddha
 A few words in Sanskrit 
Even in sleep and keeping awake a few words in Sanskrit
This called yoga 
Moderation never means what happens it destroys all kinds
of dukha suffering 
So by the time Buddha reached the present Bodhgaya 
some of you may have glance for forty-five forty-three forty-four years ago
 nineteen forty-three more than fifty years now I did go there it
has developed much later now 
Many new things have been added 
In the last century the whole temple was covered by a big 
one word 
One English Collector of that district it is in Bihar
 two words by name he just by chance he was escavating
something he found 
The tip of a brick temple and he asked these people
to remove a old temple that is there in Bodhgaya two words 
temple 
Here if you view by the side or the back of the temple 
there is we have a Ashoka tree peepal tree 
Whether it is the same Ashoka tree that Buddha meditated
under we do not know 
It cannot be because two thousand five hundred years a tree cannot
 survive 
But its descendents it has also a very these are a very
good tree 
So when I because of sentiment associated with it a few
leaves I brought from that tree dry leaves that fallen 
So that was again on the same vaisakha purnima
 day he reached that place 
In the afternoon one village dame Sujata by name brought a
little payas for him 
Buddha accepted it 
We should think that Sujata is blessed because she
offered that payas to Buddha 
And that gave him some strength it is called which had
some miracle after years of mortification 
After having taken that payas he comes
to that Bodhi tree there was no temple at that time only tree was there
He sat under the tree it's called the Bodhi
vriksha or Bodh tree in English it is called 
Some some descendents of that Bodhi tree
have gone in different parts where ever Buddhism spread 
With deep determination he sat under the tree 
One of the most glorious verses that I have cone across in
Sanskrit is this that Buddha sat under the tree with deep
resolution having had taken that payas he sat
under the Bodhi tree 
He has an hymn a few words in Sanskrit 
In this seize let my body triumph and my skin bones and
flesh may be destroyed 
First a skin a few words in Sanskrit let it be
destroyed 
 A few words in Sanskrit untill I came that knowledge
 which is difficult durlabh it has never been
impossible 
Impossible means it can never be attained 
With a difficult one word that is true spiritual life
itself is difficult 
But nobody has said It is impossible 
 A few words in Sanskrit for beyonds and beyonds people
have rights and then they have obtained until I sent that
illumination 
 A few words in Sanskrit I shall not budge an inch from
this seat 
This is the determination with which Buddha Gautama
sat under the tree in the event 
That is the story comes a whole night marahans
 temptations of various kinds first sensation then
terror they go side by side 
But no yielding for any of these neither sensation nor
terror because he had a mission to fulfill 
Gautama had to become Buddha so he never afraid of every
quarter change scene is changing and mara 
became languish 
And by heard on Gautama who sat under the tree became
Buddha 
Buddha means the enlightened one 
He became fully enlightened 
Now after this he starts for it is said in the
Jataka stories that he got up from the seat coming round 
Now as symbolically they have made stone lotuses as he
came up from that seat every step that he put there was a lotus
coming under his foot 
Until he started going out 
Then starts his spiritual mission 
For forty years the first forty years with the
twenty-five years happy luxurous life marriage birth of a son 
and the determination to leave everything 
And in search of truth for ten years hard rigorous spiritual
practices 
Then again his bodhi this illumination that happen
 on the same day vaisakha purnima just exactly forty
years later 
Five hundred and sixty minus forty may be about five
hundred seventy in B C 
Then he went on preaching to people about this meaningless
 it is a performing yagas shileniyas 
Because at that time parnivantkas at your
 one word they were spending all there energy in performing
 yagas shileniyas 
It is mentioned in the Vedas in Sanskrit
 you have a desire if you want to attained heaven you have to
perform yaga yaga yagnya did not go to heaven you have
to perform sacrifice 
But all that is meaningless much later thousand year
later from Shankara lasting life refer to Shankara also who was also
against the performance of yaga sheliniyas 
It was more after the Upanishadic way of life 
Buddha also comes to the same tradition same upanishadic
tradition
He was never against this Upanishadic tradition 
But his whole concept that is vital core what he calls
 Nirvan 
He coined a new word 
In our Hindu tradition also we have this type of 
Brahma nirvana vrikchse 
Brahma the highest knowledge it's also called 
Nirvan 
If attained Brahma Nirvan such a blowing up 
because a kind of a negative concept but Shankara gives us positive
concept content to this idea or concept of the highest
realisation 
So as he was preaching men and women came this is
one notable feature in Buddhism 
He made no distinction of caste community race or sex 
Men and women are all accepted and became monks and nuns in
course of time 
Not during the time of Buddha but during the late
