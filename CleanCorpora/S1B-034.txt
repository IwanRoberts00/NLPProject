As most of you must be aware  parliament conveyance tomorrow
""
""
It will be a very important session  not only because it will be
a fairly long one  but
also because 
""
And the most crucial among all the Parliament Sessions 
""
The railway budget  will be
presented during the session 
""
There was a time  mere fiscal
exercises 
""
Exercises in balancing the revenue account and the capital account
""
""
But those days seem 
""
The present day trend is  as
 of the governments political
ideology  of the
country 
""
It has almost become a fashion with us  to
predict 
""
Well looking uh 
figuring in the newspapers  there is enough of the element of controversy
 perhaps a
really 
""
It has been my experience  although several issues
""
invariably it so happens  and
take not only the parliamentarians 
""
But this time to my mind 
clear  to
dominate  economic
""
""
To identify some of the issues and to  discuss them and analyse
them  you will see Sukharamjee
 on my
left  Bharatiya
Janata Party  Gurupadswamy of the
 Somanath
Chatterejee 
""
You might have 
""
parties  the Address of the President to the
joint session 
""
Uh before  uh we really begin to discuss the issues I would like
uh  to
enlighten us on the  very drastic
step  Address
""
""
Somanath would you like to begin  the ball rolling
""
""
""
""
""
Yes I want to make it clear at the beginning that  our
decision to boycott the session is 
""
""
We have high respect for him as a 
""
But we feel that the 
address to the joint session as uh  uh provide
for 
""
And the President is expected to announce the 
policies 
""
But so far as this government is concerned during  the
inter-session period  very important decisions on
matters  affecting the people affecting the economic situation in this
country 
""
And  taking the
Parliament into the 
bypassing the Parliamnet behind the back of the Parliament therefore we said
 will be a
mere formality because the Parliament has been  has been reduced to
irrelevence
""
And this speech all this  address to joint session will serve no
purpose 
""
Therefore to register our protest 
way of functioning  granted
 we felt that we should
register  without
showing any disrespect to the  personell
""
""
Murali would you  agree with this point of view or would
you think that the stand taken by the opposition is the little  uh little
""
""
""
Well I think they are fulfilling their role eminently
""
""
Yes
""
""
That is to oppose  and oppose
""
But propose nothing 
""
There is no logic in this at all 
""
Because firstly  in
the month of July 
""
Steps were taken to implement that policy 
""
There have been very important lengthy discussions  on all
aspects  whether it is devaluation
 whether it is the entry of the
multinationals 
""
We have had extensive debates  not only in the last budget
session 
""
Now I cannot understand  their saying that all this has been
implemented behind the back of the Parliament 
""
I think they are merely finding an excuse  because they are
today 
""
 that after
the Punjab election  take the events of the
""
particularly the Prime Minister  P V Narsimha Rao has held the whole
situation 
""
Look at the  on the
twenty-sixth of January  ekta
yatra 
""
The determine manner in which we repelled  any crossing into
Kashmir 
""
The way in 
brought 
""
And in the process we have achieved a position  where there is
little threat  to the survival of the government
""
""
""
""
""
Well Murali you have begun already talking about the
achievements of the government
""
Where as I thought first we will identify the  issues that are
likely to come up
""
What Sukharamjee  are the main issues
 that are likely to come up ?
""
Or what do you expect  ?
""
""
 Mere khyalme teen kism ke jo samaseyein hai ya masle
 economic
issue 
aur teesre  jaise Jharkand
hai  magar mai aisa samajta hoon ke sab
se jyade 
mei  ke
upar hai  ke jab is
""
one word  mushkil se hamare pas teen hafte
se kum ka  tha
 foreign
loan  uhm uske liye bhi hamare paas badi samaseyein thi
 lene pade waise
 usme hamesha
""
opt  hard options
 is baat se ye jyada taur par
""
karengi yeh 
""
""
Gurupadswamy do you  uh the
 ?
""
And the hard decisions taken  have let to a kind of a reforming
of this  view of the opposition
""
""
""
See let me  uh answer your first question
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Why 
Left Front  President's
""
""
You 
so many important  without reference to
Parliament 
""
My friend Bhandarajee  have
been already discussed in Parliament 
""
Discussion on difference 
""
Many issues are discussed in Parliament 
""
But  the government takes
decisions 
""
I do not find in the annals of Parliament  so many important
and vital decisions have been taken  without the approval of Parliament
""
""
""
Gurupadswamy will you identify one or two such  decisions
 a policy implementation and
a decision 
""
""
""
you will know that  agreement that has been
reached  International Monitory Fund
""
""
Duncan proposals  intellectual
property rights  and so on
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
They have not been thoroughly discussed 
""
And 
""
Their vital issues is affecting the economy of the country itself
""
""
So after a good deal of thought  came to this
conclusion 
""
And uh  Address is a
very important occasion 
""
A unique event 
""
And the President has to 
the present  what agenda will be taken
up  ?
""
What are the issues  by the
government  ?
""
So I do not want  a
dull affair a ritualistic affair 
""
It should be it should be a very important 
""
And I think that  has been destroyed
""
""
Well  is the major
opposition in the 
""
And  shared
the perception of the  Parties and the
""
""
And they 
Address 
""
Does this mean  is
""
economic policies  ?
""
Or is it because they think it is  to announce a
boycott ?
""
""
""
""
""
 agree with
this conclusion that the rise in prices  growing graph
of unemployment  of the structural reforms
that you have carried out  ?
""
And secondly  given
its green signal to many of these policies and then you could have walked on
them 
""
Their complaint basically is that  the government has
unilaterally more or less  gone ahead with very very vital decisions in
the economic field  even though you had acquainted them with the broad
orientation 
""
""
Well I won't agree with  I think
the most important issue 
""
Because inflation  is the cruelest form of taxation on the
poorest 
""
And no government can afford to impose that taxation  on our
people 
""
I think my party as well as  government
""
""
Undoubtedly we were placed  in a as it has been explain by my
""
""
We were placed  we had to do certain
thing not  take very
hard options 
""
We didn't choose 
""
All of us had predicted  including the treasury benches
""
They had predicted that the budget would  result in price rise
""
""
So I do not think that something new has happened 
""
 in this case unfortunately
have been 
""
Therefore that is one thing
""
I don't think  whatever has been done by the government is a
sequence 
""
Now taking what  for example on
the Duncal proposal  we have set up a high powered committee under the
chairmanship of Arjun Singhjee 
""
And he had 
talks with all sections 
""
All the leaders of the opposition parties  all sections of the
society 
""
And no decision has yet been taken 
""
I think these are all the excuses
""
One must 
Presidential Speech will be lacklustre or without substance 
""
It will be full of substance
""
There will be a motion of  and the motion of
thank would be voted upon 
""
""
""
""
""
That is true
""
That is the convention  usually
""
But Murali you made uh 
""
The first point is that 
system itself there was an inbuilt  or compulsion for the
rise in prices and therefore the rise was anticipated
""
But you must remember  on
the basis of a manifesto which had promised  that prices will be rolled
back to the July  uh nineteen ninety level
""
That has not happened 
""
On the contrary the criticism of the opposition  as I see it is
that the country  beset by
""
""
Now Somanath  uh
serious objections if I remember  to the very idea of approaching the
""
""
And all the oppositions parties have had reservations on the kind
of conditionalities which the 
""
Now the claim of the Finaince Minister has been that the  the
benifits of this  in the
""
""
Meanwhile prices are going up 
""
What is the perception of the opposition  ?
""
""
""
""
""
You see  all our apprehensions have proved to be correct
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
Unfortunately in the sense  that the common people are
suffering 
""
It is very easy to say that for the next three years the prices
will rise there will be inflation 
""
But what is the government going to do to come to the rescue of
the 
""
We have been  strengthening the public
distribution system  making um essential commodities available to the
common people at a vulnerable sections of the society  a
reasonable price 
""
But instead of doing that we have had to find during the
inter-session the government has increased  the administered price of the
commodities  which are distributed
through public distribution system 
""
Therefore this government has not only not made an attempt to
contain the price rise 
""
Why administered price increased  ?
""
Now  this is very easy to say there will be prise rise because
of so called structure and reform 
""
We by structure and reform I mean  we find that there is a
complete surrender to the 
""
We have never said  one need not or one
should not go to 
""
We say 
""
We should not accept conditional deeds  which will be
destructive of our economic 
""
And which will mean abandonment of our national committment to
self-reliance 
""
And precisely that has happened in this country 
""
Today you find every section of the community is feeling the pinch
of 
""
And not only the poorest of the poor even the middle class today
are talking of this 
""
Now 
""
without the Parliament being taken into confidence
