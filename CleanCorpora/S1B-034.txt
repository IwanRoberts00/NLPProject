figuring in the newspapers  there is enough of the element of controversy

Chatterejee

You might have

parties  the Address of the President to the
joint session 
""

uh  to
enlighten us on the  very drastic
step  Address
""
""
Somanath would you like to begin  the ball rolling
""
""
""
""
""
Yes I want to make it clear at the beginning that  our
decision to boycott the session is 
""
""
""
""
But we feel that the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
matters  affecting the people affecting the economic situation in this
""
""
And  taking the
Parliament into the 
""
 will be a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
you think that the stand taken by the opposition is the little  uh little
""
""
""
Well I think they are fulfilling their role eminently
""
""
Yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We have had extensive debates  not only in the last budget
""
""
""
""
""
I think they are merely finding an excuse  because they are
""
""
""
the Punjab election  take the events of the
""
particularly the Prime Minister  P V Narsimha Rao has held the whole
situation 
""
Look at the  on the
""
yatra 
""
The determine manner in which we repelled  any crossing into
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
likely to come up
""
""
 that are likely to come up ?

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
of this  view of the opposition
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Parliament 
""
""
been already discussed in Parliament 
""
Discussion on difference 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a decision 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
property rights  and so on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And 
""
Their vital issues is affecting the economy of the country itself
""
""
So after a good deal of thought  came to this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
government  ?
""
So I do not want  a
dull affair a ritualistic affair 
""
It should be it should be a very important 
""
And I think that  has been destroyed
""
""
Well  is the major
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Does this mean  is
""
economic policies  ?
""
""
boycott ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
its green signal to many of these policies and then you could have walked on
""
""
""
unilaterally more or less  gone ahead with very very vital decisions in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And no government can afford to impose that taxation  on our
""
""
I think my party as well as  government
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sequence 
""
Now taking what  for example on
""
chairmanship of Arjun Singhjee 
""
""
talks with all sections 
""
""
society 
""
""
""
I think these are all the excuses
""
One must 
""
""
""
""
""
thank would be voted upon 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is the convention  usually
""
""
""
""
system itself there was an inbuilt  or compulsion for the
""
""
But you must remember  on
the basis of a manifesto which had promised  that prices will be rolled
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of conditionalities which the 
""
Now the claim of the Finaince Minister has been that the  the
""
""
""
Meanwhile prices are going up 
""
What is the perception of the opposition  ?
""
""
""
""
""
You see  all our apprehensions have proved to be correct
""
""
""
""
""
""
Unfortunately in the sense  that the common people are
""
""
""
""
""
But what is the government going to do to come to the rescue of
""
""
We have been  strengthening the public
""
""
reasonable price 
""
""
""
commodities  which are distributed
""
""
Therefore this government has not only not made an attempt to
""
""
Why administered price increased  ?
""
Now  this is very easy to say there will be prise rise because
of so called structure and reform 
""
""
""
""
""
should not go to 
""
We say 
""
""
destructive of our economic 
""
""
self-reliance
