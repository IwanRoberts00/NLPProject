<I>
As most of you must be aware parliament conveyance tomorrow
 for its first session in the new year 
It will be a very important session not only because it will be
a fairly long one stretching right into the middle of May but
also because because it will be the budget session 
And the most crucial among all the Parliament Sessions 
The railway budget and the annual general budget will be
presented during the session 
There was a time when the budgets were just mere fiscal
exercises 
Exercises in balancing the revenue account and the capital account
But those days seem far away 
The present day trend is that the budgets are regarded as
 very strong and major indicators of the governments political
ideology and its approach to the economic problems of the
country 
It has almost become a fashion with us media people to
predict that every session of Parliament will be a stormy one 
Well looking uh into the issues that have been 
figuring in the newspapers there is enough of the element of controversy
 in them to make this coming session of Parliament perhaps a
really stormy one 
It has been my experience that although several issues
 are identified as likely to dominate uh Parliament sessions 
invariably it so happens that some other issues come in and
take not only the parliamentarians but also the people by surprise 
But this time to my mind cough the issues are fairly 
clear because I expect at least uh the issue to
dominate the current session of Parliament will be mostly economic
 in nature 
To identify some of the issues and to discuss them and analyse
them with me tonight around this table you will see Sukharamjee
 and Murali Bhandarijee of the Congress-I on my
left Shrimati Sushama Swaraj of the Bharatiya
Janata Party and Shri Gurupadswamy of the
 Janata Dal and Shri Somanath
Chatterejee of the CPM 
You might have uh read in the papers that the 
 National Front and the Left Front 
parties have decided to boycott the Address of the President to the
joint session of the two houses tomorrow morning 
Uh before uh we really begin to discuss the issues I would like
uh the representatives of the two parties with us here today to
enlighten us on the logic and rationale of this very very drastic
step of uh deciding to boycott the President's Address
Somanath would you like to begin set the ball rolling
 Yeah 
Yes I want to make it clear at the beginning that our
decision to boycott the session is not any not a 
 reflection on the President personally 
We have high respect for him as a as a person 
But we feel that the President's joint address 
address to the joint session as uh even the Constitution uh provide
for is not meant to be a ritual 
And the President is expected to announce the government's 
policies economic policies primarily as well as other policies 
But so far as this government is concerned during in the
inter-session period they have taken very important decisions on
matters affecting the people affecting the economic situation in this
country 
And all those decisions have been taken without taking the
Parliament into the con uh confidence 
bypassing the Parliamnet behind the back of the Parliament therefore we said
 just to go and listen to what has already taken place will be a
mere formality because the Parliament has been has been reduced to
irrelevence
And this speech all this address to joint session will serve no
purpose 
Therefore to register our protest to the governemnt's 
way of functioning and taking the Parliament for the granted
 ignoring the Parliament in vital issues we felt that we should
register our protest in a more and a very democratic manner without
showing any disrespect to the President's personell
Murali would you agree with this point of view or would
you think that the stand taken by the opposition is the little uh little
Well I think they are fulfilling their role eminently
Yes
That is to oppose oppose and oppose
But propose nothing 
There is no logic in this at all 
Because firstly in the last budget which was only in
the month of July the whole policy was unfolded 
Steps were taken to implement that policy 
There have been very important lengthy discussions on all
aspects whether it is the industrial policy whether it is devaluation
 whether it is free market economy whether it is the entry of the
multinationals whether it is the export policy 
We have had extensive debates not only in the last budget
session but also in the winter session 
Now I cannot understand their saying that all this has been
implemented behind the back of the Parliament 
I think they are merely finding an excuse because they are
today without any substantial issue in the Parliament 
 I think they are also conscious that after
the Punjab election and particularly if I may take the events of the
 just last four weeks the excellent manner in which 
particularly the Prime Minister P V Narsimha Rao has held the whole
situation 
Look at the unfurling of the National Flag on the
twenty-sixth of January ending in the fiasco of the ekta ekta
yatra 
The determine manner in which we repelled any crossing into
Kashmir on the eleventh of February 
The way in in which we have bro 
brought democracy back on the race in Punjab 
And in the process we have achieved a position where there is
little threat to the survival of the government
 One word 
Well Murali you have begun already talking about the
achievements of the government
Where as I thought first we will identify the issues that are
likely to come up
What Sukharamjee in view of your party are the main issues
 that are likely to come up ?
Or what do you expect the major thrust to be on ?
 Mere khyalme teen kism ke jo samaseyein hai ya masle
 Parliament mei ayenge ek to arthik economic
issue aur doosre defence of country 
aur teesre socio- political issues jaise Jharkand
hai Jammu Kashmir hai doosre hain magar mai aisa samajta hoon ke sab
se jyade jo debate ya Parliament 
mei jo uhm jyada samay lagega woh economic issues ke
upar hai abhi jaise aap ko malum hai sare desh ko malum hai ke jab is
 government ne karyabhar sambhala to hamare 
one word position kya thi mushkil se hamare pas teen hafte
se kum ka hamare pas ayat ka woh foreign exchange tha
 aur uh phir external hamare pas jo foreign
loan ka tha ek uhm uske liye bhi hamare paas badi samaseyein thi
 to is baat se bade kuch harsh step lene pade waise
 sare sansar mei itne democracys hain usme hamesha
 democratic government jo hai woh sakht options 
opt karti hain magar is sarkar ke samne hard options
 ke siway koi uh chara nahi tha is baat se ye jyada taur par
 financial problem jo hain yeh dominate 
karengi yeh debates 
Gurupadswamy do you uh share this view that uh the
 government had no option but to go in for hard decisions ?
And the hard decisions taken have let to a kind of a reforming
of this economic structure which in the view of the opposition
 has not been on right lines 
See let me uh answer your first question
Yes 
Why National Front and 
Left Front have decided to boycott the President's
 Address 
You appreciate for last twenty years at no time 
so many important decisions have been taken without reference to
Parliament 
My friend Bhandarajee said many of the issues have
been already discussed in Parliament 
Discussion on difference of issues is one thing 
Many issues are discussed in Parliament 
But I am talking of issues where the government takes
decisions 
I do not find in the annals of Parliament so many important
and vital decisions have been taken without the approval of Parliament
Gurupadswamy will you identify one or two such decisions
 when you are making a distinction between a policy implementation and
a decision 
 You'll you'll uh you'll see 
you will know that uh functions the agreement that has been
reached on various issues in the International Monitory Fund
 and World Bank 
Duncan proposals and one word intellectual
property rights and so on
Uhm 
They have not been thoroughly discussed 
And approval of Parliament has not been obtained 
Their vital issues is affecting the economy of the country itself
So after a good deal of thought we came to this
conclusion 
And uh I just say that President's Address is a
very important occasion 
A unique event which comes once in every year 
And the President has to tell Parliament tell the country 
the present situation shoud also say what agenda will be taken
up by government ?
What are the issues on which decisions are taken by the
government ?
So I do not want the address be a a dreary affair a
dull affair a ritualistic affair 
It should be it should be a very important document 
And I think that one word has been destroyed
Well Bharatiya Janata Party is the major
opposition in the Lok Sabha 
And the BJP as you see has not shared
the perception of the National Front Parties and the
 Left Front Parties 
And they are not boycotting the President's 
Address 
Does this mean Sushmajee that BJP is
 more or less in agreement with the Congress government's 
economic policies ?
Or is it because they think it is not wise to announce a
boycott ?
 In Hindi 
 Accha Murali do you agree with
this conclusion that the rise in prices and the growing growing graph
of unemployment is a logical corollary of the structural reforms
that you have carried out in the party in the last one year ?
And secondly that uh Parliament could have given
its green signal to many of these policies and then you could have walked on
them 
Their complaint basically is that the government has
unilaterally more or less gone ahead with very very vital decisions in
the economic field even though you had acquainted them with the broad
orientation 
Well I won't agree with that because I think
the most important issue is the price rise 
Because inflation is the cruelest form of taxation on the
poorest of our people 
And no government can afford to impose that taxation on our
people 
I think my party as well as my party's government
 is conscious of this fact 
Undoubtedly we were placed in a as it has been explain by my
 colleague Sukharamjee 
We were placed in a position where we had to do certain
thing not uh willingly in a sense that we had to take very
hard options 
We didn't choose soft options 
All of us had predicted including the treasury benches
They had predicted that the budget would result in price rise
 and the inflation has to be controlled 
So I do not think that something new has happened 
 Everybody's expectations in this case unfortunately
have been found to be true 
Therefore that is one thing
I don't think whatever has been done by the government is a
sequence 
Now taking what my friend Gurupadswamy says for example on
the Duncal proposal we have set up a high powered committee under the
chairmanship of Arjun Singhjee 
And he had been have been having 
talks with all sections 
All the leaders of the opposition parties all sections of the
society 
And no decision has yet been taken 
I think these are all the excuses
One must in a democracy not anticipate that the 
Presidential Speech will be lacklustre or without substance 
It will be full of substance
There will be a motion of two words and the motion of
thank would be voted upon 
 Yes 
That is true
That is the convention usually
But Murali you made uh one or two points 
The first point is that uh there was a uh in the 
system itself there was an inbuilt provision or compulsion for the
rise in prices and therefore the rise was anticipated
But you must remember this government came into being on
the basis of a manifesto which had promised that prices will be rolled
back to the July uh nineteen ninety level
That has not happened 
On the contrary the criticism of the opposition as I see it is
that the country does not only have inflation but it is also beset by
 two words 
Now Somanath uhm your party uh has had uh
serious objections if I remember to the very idea of approaching the
 IMF 
And all the oppositions parties have had reservations on the kind
of conditionalities which the IMF uh imposed 
Now the claim of the Finaince Minister has been that the the
benifits of this reforms that have been introduce will be felt in the
 only in the next three years and not before 
Meanwhile prices are going up 
What is the perception of the opposition to this situation ?
 Uhm 
You see all our apprehensions have proved to be correct
Ah
Unfortunately in the sense that the common people are
suffering because of the policies of this government 
It is very easy to say that for the next three years the prices
will rise there will be inflation 
But what is the government going to do to come to the rescue of
the people common people 
We have been uh stressing on strengthening the public
distribution system making um essential commodities available to the
common people at a vulnerable sections of the society at a a
reasonable price 
But instead of doing that we have had to find during the
inter-session the government has increased the administered price of the
commodities namely rice wheat etcetera which are distributed
through public distribution system 
Therefore this government has not only not made an attempt to
contain the price rise is well I think fuel to the fire 
Why administered price increased ?
Now this is very easy to say there will be prise rise because
of so called structure and reform 
We by structure and reform I mean we find that there is a
complete surrender to the IMF 
We have never said one word one need not or one
should not go to IMF 
We say we should not go there on bended knees 
We should not accept conditional deeds which will be
destructive of our economic one word 
And which will mean abandonment of our national committment to
self-reliance 
And precisely that has happened in this country 
Today you find every section of the community is feeling the pinch
of not only the pinch the weight of this inflation 
And not only the poorest of the poor even the middle class today
are talking of this 
Now apart from this the very economic dir 
 direction of this country has been altered totally 
without the Parliament being taken into confidence
