<I>
We have in this studio today three prominent persons 
related to carbohydrates technology and industry 
Let us introduce ourselves 
Former senior District Director Ahmadabad Textile Industry
Research Association 
He is head of Carbohydrate Research Division 
He is currently working there as emeritus CSIR Scien
 uh professor 
Dr K R Bhattacharya is a former scientist Central Food
Technological Research Institute 
And he is an expert in food-carbohydrates 
And we have Dr P M Shah 
He is a technologist in a industry related to carbohydrates 
typically making starch and its products 
Now Dr Shrivastav I request you to tell us what are
diverse materials which we call as carbohydrates and what are their
common and less common uses ?
Then I'll also like you to elaborate how India
acquired technology on carbohydrates which we are uh looking
today 
And how do we compare in utilization of our carbohydrate research
 uh carbohydrate resources compared to international level ?
Carbohydrates are one of the most uh widely and
 commonly occurring products in nature 
We use them almost everyday carbohydrates are
either sugars which are normally sweet 
Or they are made up of sugars 
Carbohydrates either are of one unit or two units 
several units or hundreds of units 
Those which are one unit are called sugars those which are
two units are called disaccharides 
Saccharide is standing for sugar 
Those which have three units are trisaccharides and so on
Tetra penta and then polysaccharides which are 
which have a large number of sugar units in their molecular 
structure 
To illustrate the diversity of carbohydrate materials 
we have here on this table a number of carbohydrate substances
The first is a single unit sugar called glucose 
It is also known as dextrose which is commonly used 
during recuperating process of patients 
Then we have a disaccharide with which most of you are
familiar 
And this is cane-sugar or sucrose the sample is also
here 
Then we have a large variety of polysaccharide 
The most common of which is cellulose 
By the name itself you can understand that 
this is the sugar of cells 
Or the polysaaccharide of cell and that is why the word 
is cellulose 
All plant cells are made up of cellulose 
Among one of the most common substances made up of
cellulose or cotton a sample of which is here 
Similarly paper on which we write is also made up 
of essentially cellulose 
Then we have another material which actually is a
seed carbohydrate and it is starch 
It is a polymer of glucose unit 
This is also widely present in seeds and in stems 
and in tubers 
Some examples of these are also here 
We have rice which has a large quantity of starch
 in it 
Then we have corn from which starch industrially 
is isolated 
Now some of these products are converted into food
materials 
Snack food or fast food 
For example the corn when puffed gives popcorn 
And potato which also contains lot of starch gives potato
chips 
These samples are also displayed here 
Besides the example shown here there are large number of
other carbohydrates
For example the skeletal material of insects and
 sea animals like shrimps and crabs and lobsters is made of
 made up of a polymer of which is a sugar modified sugar
 glucose I mean 
And this polymer is called chitin 
At present there is lot of interest in this polymer 
these because it occurs to a very large extent among the sea
 animals 
 We're all familiar with the cane sugar industry
Cane sugar is one of the cheapest and purest 
organic material which is available 
It is more than ninety-nine percent pure
And its cost is anywhere from rupees seven 
to ten 
Then we have the cotton which is the basis for 
all textiles 
Whether hundred percent cotton or blended cotton 
Similarly paper as I mentioned earlier is essentially 
cellulose 
And the paper is made from the wood which is
chipped and then converted into pulp and then later on 
converted into the paper which we use for writing 
Recently we have a one word industry which
is uh based in India and in Pakistan 
And cultivation of it is mostly in Rajasthan Haryana
 Gujarat and Punjab 
Although in India we have modified many of these 
corbohydrate polymers like cellulose starch and gums 
When we compare the level of technology available
in our country vis-a-vis the advanced countries we have still 
far to go 
Even though India has made considerable progress in 
utilizing its own sources of carbohydrate materials and 
based on this several industries old and new have been set up
Dr Shrivastav has very much elaborated the industrial uses
of carbohydrates 
Now Dr K R Bhattacharya who is present with us and he is an
expert in food uh carbohydrates 
He can additionally tell us about the technology we have in
carbohydrate utilization as food 
You know one of the primary requisites of the food
 as we like it is its texture 
By texture I mean the qualities of how we perceive
the material in our mouth 
Whether it is hard or soft whether it sticks to the mouth
 to the teeth or whether it doesn't stick 
Whether the food crumbles when you bite or it slowly melts 
So the it is liquidic or it is soft 
Now this is the totality of these is called
texture 
Now take the taste of uh the potato chips Dr Shrivastav has
mentioned or the the popcorn 
Now that has crumbled uh if you take uh potato as such 
then it is soft it doesn't crumble like that 
Or take for instance the case of idli 
 which is a very popular food in South India and now has become very
popular throughout India 
Now it has a definite texture
 It's extremely soft and pliable and yet it
doesn't i i it's not pliable
in the sense that it it deforms slowly i i i 
 it brakes 
 It is it is soft and yet 
breakable 
Now the point I am trying to say is that this particular
characteristic food this called your food its texture is
contributed most importantly by its carbohydrate contents 
A rice contains starch about ninety percent starch 
Maize contains about eighty percent starch potato contains 
but for its water content virtually mo 
more than ninety-five percent of starch
So if if if cornflake and and potato chips 
And there are other materials which contain other kinds of uh 
monosaccharide polysaccharide or different kinds of carbohydrates 
Now it is these carbohydrate content which contribute to the
largest extent to the texture 
To our perceptions of food as we like it
The food have not only nutritional content not only its 
taste perse but also the texture perception by which we like or
dislike a kind of food 
Dr Bhattacharya you've given a very interesting
example 
And I suppose the texture of the same carbohydrate food can be
modified like a cooked vegetable made from potatoes that has one
texture 
And the chips have quite a different texture
So I think this is a part of your technology that we can change
the texture of the same material 
Yes uh Prof Mathur what you say is very right 
Uh as you mentioned potato has one texture 
Potato fried in a particular way has one texture
Potato fried in a different way and in different form has a
slightly different texture 
But uh what I would like to stress is it is not only
the way you prepare it is not only the way you process but also
the inherent inherent uh composition uh inherent trite
 content quantity quality of the carbohydrate could
play a very important role 
Dr Bhattacharya as in one aspect on which you might stress
upon is the energy which is uh given by the carbohydrate 
material that are ingested by people 
Because this is the family source of energy 
Beside texture energy is a very important factor 
which is contributed by carbohydrates 
Yeah I think it's a very good point Dr
Srivastav and Dr Mathur has reminded me 
We eat food for for primarily two reasons 
One is for energy and the other is for various 
constituents that our body needs 
Uh energy means various energy doesn't necessarily mean only
the work that we do 
We need energy not only for the work we do but our body itself
is doing millions of functions continously 
Even if we lie perfectly still and that even then we need
 approximately twelve hundred to fifty 
fifteen hundred calories per day just to maintain our body
functions 
Now as Dr Srivastav very rightly mentioned it is the
food which enables us to obtain that is this energy and carry
out our functions 
Now it has been shown that carbohydrate particularly starch 
sugar they contain approximately four calories it is a kind
of unit a measure like uh inch or metre or gram 
It is a kind of measure of energy 
Each gram of sugar or starch or carbohydrate material 
contains approximately four calory of energy per gram 
So if we need uh let's say on an average some
two thousand calories per day an average man 
Then you can say we would have needed if we ate
carbohydrate alone we would have needed approximately five hundred grams
of carbohydrates 
Of course we don't eat this much because we eat other things as
well
You know we not only eat carbohydrates but we eat proteins and
fat
And fat supplies much more energy for the unit weight 
as compared to carbohydrates 
So as uh Dr Shrivastav has very rightly said supplier of
energy 
But uh I'll again come back uh human being's 
 needs now satiation is a factor 
So liking is a major one word provide that we
enjoy our food and that's why you eat 
We just when we eat we just don't think that we
must maintain our body and we must have nutrition 
We enjoy food so we eat 
And the texture is a very very important part of the content
Dr P M Shah the technologist in a carbohydrate based
industry will elaborate about the prospects of this industry 
 It's relevence to national development and our
technology compared to international standard 
Now the relevence of this carbohydrate or carbohydrate
chemistry is very much in usage to human life 
Right from morning when you get up you use either a
carbohydrate or its product 
Take for example in the morning you're doing like 
using a tooth paste 
It contains a product of carbohydrate 
Secondly you go for a breakfast you have got something 
on starch 
You wear clothes it is made up of either cellulose which
is a carbohydrate 
Or it is processed with a carbohydrate called starch for
sizing or finishing 
Then you come to the uh children for as a confectionery
 there it is a product of carbohydrate 
Then you come to the medicine which is required either
by young boy or a woman or an old man it is also containing some
products of carbohydrate chemistry 
Then the industry is such a marvellous industry 
that none of its product is used is wasted or it is completly
utilized 
Take for example the manufacturing of starch 
There you take either rice starch or maize starch or a
 one word starch 
All its constituents are either converted into starch or
 its uh ingredients are used somewhere in the cattle feeds or
 in some other indusrty 
So the beauty of this industry is that nothing is wasted 
Even the waste water is used for one of the based industry
called pharmaceutical industry 
So you can understand the rele relevence
 of this industry in the human life 
Now coming to the other aspect of man uh this 
natio national important things other things
Now our industry say as for example starch industry or 
its other products which is called refinery refined 
 products 
That is the total productions of the country is to the tune of
around two hundred crores of rupees 
And we are utilizing nearly about two hundred
thousand tonnes of grains 
Say in terms when I say grain I usually mentioned
 mention maize 
Then to the exchequer it is giving nearly about thirty
to thirty-five crores of rupees 
Not only that but it gives a direct employment to more
than eight thousand people 
And indirect employment to the other eight to ten thousand
of people 
Now this is just I give you a small uh some idea 
about the industry 
Now what are we manufacturing in carbohydrate industry ?
We take right from the grain 
We process the grain and separate its ingredients of which
it is composed of 
It is composed of if you take a maize it is composed of
four parts 
One is called oil bearing substance called germ then
protein which is a protein like substance then starch which is a
carbohydrate and fiber which is called a celluline birch 
Now similarly also in one word or in rice you
have got not only same proportion but a different proportion of
starch and fiber or celluline substances 
Now technically speaking when we are doing this
carbohydrate industry starch or a refinery product our 
machinaries are practically comparable to what we have got in
the most advanced countries 
Not only that but our products are meeting the standards
and specifications of international requirements 
You take our products it meets I P standard but it
also meets U S standard or British standard 
That is all our products are meeting the standards 
Therefore you can very well understand that the processes
that we are using it the technology that we are adopting is
same as what all other advanced countries are using 
And technologically I don't think we will be in any way 
away or slightly different 
Only thing we may have some difficulty that the
advancement of the computerization which is available in the
western countries may not be here because we have to use either a
human or we have to use a human as well as a mechanical man not that
much of computerization
