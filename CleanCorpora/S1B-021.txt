We have in this studio 
related to carbohydrates 
""
Let us introduce ourselves 
""
Former  Ahmadabad Textile Industry
Research Association 
""
He is head of 
""
He is currently working there  Scien
""
""
Dr K R Bhattacharya  Central Food
Technological Research Institute 
""
And he is an expert in food-carbohydrates 
""
And we have Dr 
""
He is a technologist in a industry 
typically making starch and its products 
""
Now  what are
diverse materials which we call as carbohydrates  and what are their
common  ?
""
Then  how India
acquired  uh looking
today 
""
And how do we compare in utilization of our carbohydrate research
 ?
""
""
Carbohydrates  and
""
""
We  are
either sugars 
""
Or they are made up of 
""
Carbohydrates either 
several units 
""
Those which are  those which are
two units are called 
""
Saccharide is standing for sugar 
""
Those which have three units  and so on
""
""
Tetra 
which have a large number 
structure 
""
To illustrate 
we have here  carbohydrate substances
""
""
The first 
""
It is also known as 
during recuperating process 
""
Then  most of you are
familiar 
""
And this is cane-sugar  is also
here 
""
Then we have a large variety 
""
The most common of which 
""
By 
this is 
""
Or the polysaaccharide of cell 
is cellulose 
""
All 
""
Among one of the most common  made up of
cellulose 
""
Similarly paper 
of essentially 
""
Then  is a
seed carbohydrate 
""
It is a polymer 
""
This is also 
and in tubers 
""
Some examples of these 
""
We have  starch
""
""
Then 
is isolated 
""
Now some of these products  food
materials 
""
Snack food 
""
For example 
""
And potato  gives potato
chips 
""
These samples are also 
""
Besides  there are large number of
other carbohydrates
""
For example  and
 of
 modified sugar
""
""
And this polymer 
""
At present there is lot of interest 
these  among the sea
""
""
 cane sugar industry
""
""
Cane sugar 
organic material 
""
It is more than ninety-nine percent pure
""
And its cost is 
to ten 
""
Then we have 
all 
""
Whether hundred percent cotton 
""
Similarly paper 
cellulose 
""
And  which is
chipped 
converted into 
""
Recently  which
is 
""
And  Haryana
""
""
Although 
corbohydrate polymers 
""
When we  available
in our country 
far to go 
""
Even though 
utilizing 
based on this  have been set up
""
""
""
Dr Shrivastav has very much  elaborated the industrial uses
of carbohydrates 
""
Now Dr K R Bhattacharya who is present with us  and he is an
expert in food 
""
He can additionally tell us about the  in
carbohydrate utilization as food 
""
""
You know  requisites of the food
""
""
By texture I mean  perceive
the material in our mouth 
""
Whether it is hard  whether it sticks to the mouth
""
""
Whether the food crumbles when you bite 
""
So 
""
Now  is called
texture 
""
Now take the taste of  Dr Shrivastav has
mentioned 
""
Now that has crumbled uh 
then 
""
Or 
 which is a very popular food in South India and now has become very
popular throughout India 
""
Now it has a definite texture
""
 it
doesn't  not pliable
in the sense that it 
""
""
""
breakable 
""
Now the point I am trying to say is  this particular
characteristic food  is
contributed most importantly by its carbohydrate contents 
""
A rice contains starch 
""
Maize contains about eighty percent starch 
but for its water content 
more  than ninety-five percent of starch
""
So if 
""
And there are other materials which contain other kinds of uh 
monosaccharide polysaccharide or different kinds of carbohydrates 
""
Now it is these carbohydrate content which  contribute to the
largest extent 
""
To our perceptions of food  as we like it
""
The food have not only nutritional content 
taste perse but also the texture perception  or
dislike a kind of food 
""
""
Dr Bhattacharya  given a very interesting
example 
""
And I suppose the texture of  the same carbohydrate food can be
modified  cooked vegetable made from potatoes that has one
texture 
""
And the chips have quite a different texture
""
So I think this is a part of your technology  that we can change
the texture 
""
""
Yes uh 
""
Uh 
""
Potato fried in a particular way has one texture
""
Potato fried in a different way  and in different form has a
slightly different texture 
""
But uh  it is not only
the way you prepare  but also
the inherent  trite
 could
play a very important role 
""
""
Dr Bhattacharya as in one aspect  on which you might stress
upon 
material that are ingested by people 
""
Because this is the family source of energy 
""
""
Beside texture energy is a very important 
which is contributed by 
""
""
Yeah  Dr
Srivastav and Dr Mathur has reminded me 
""
We eat food for 
""
One is for 
constituents that our body needs 
""
Uh energy means  various energy doesn't necessarily mean only
the work that we do 
""
We need energy not only for the work we do  but our body itself
is doing millions of functions continously 
""
Even if we lie perfectly still  even then we need
""
fifteen  just to maintain our body
functions 
""
Now  it is the
food  carry
out our functions 
""
Now it has been shown that carbohydrate particularly starch 
sugar  it is a kind
of unit 
""
It is a kind of measure of energy 
""
Each gram of 
contains approximately four 
""
So  some
two thousand 
""
Then you can  ate
carbohydrate alone we would have needed approximately  five hundred grams
of carbohydrates 
""
Of course we don't eat this much because we eat other things as
well
""
You know we not only eat carbohydrates but we eat  proteins and
fat
""
And fat supplies 
as compared to carbohydrates 
""
So as uh Dr Shrivastav has very rightly said  supplier of
energy 
""
But uh 
""
""
So liking  provide that we
enjoy our food and 
""
We just  that we
must maintain our body and we must have nutrition 
""
We enjoy food so we eat 
""
And the texture  is a very very important part of the content
""
""
Dr P M Shah  in a carbohydrate based
industry will elaborate 
""
 our
technology compared to international standard 
""
""
Now the relevence of this carbohydrate  or carbohydrate
chemistry 
""
Right from morning when you get up  you use either a
carbohydrate 
""
Take for example in the morning 
using a tooth paste 
""
It contains a product 
""
Secondly 
on starch 
""
You wear clothes  which
is a carbohydrate 
""
Or  for
sizing or finishing 
""
Then you come  for as a confectionery
""
""
Then you come  either
by young boy  containing some
products of carbohydrate chemistry 
""
Then 
that none of its product  or it is completly
utilized 
""
Take for example the manufacturing of starch 
""
There  or a
""
""
All its constituents  or
 or
""
""
So the beauty of this industry 
""
Even the waste water  is used for one of the based industry
called pharmaceutical industry 
""
So you can understand the  relevence
""
""
Now coming 
natio  other things
""
""
Now our industry 
its other products 
""
""
That is the total productions of the country  is to the tune of
around two hundred 
""
And  two hundred
thousand tonnes of grains 
""
Say in terms  mentioned
""
""
Then  nearly about thirty
to thirty-five 
""
Not only that  to more
than eight thousand people 
""
And indirect  eight to ten thousand
of people 
""
Now this is just 
about the industry 
""
Now what are we manufacturing  ?
""
We take right from the grain 
""
We process the grain  of which
it is composed of 
""
It is composed of  it is composed of
four parts 
""
One is called  then
protein which is a protein like substance  then starch which is a
carbohydrate 
""
Now similarly also in  you
have got  but a different proportion of
starch 
""
Now  doing this
carbohydrate industry 
machinaries  in
the most advanced countries 
""
Not only that  the standards
and specifications 
""
You take our products  it
also meets U S standard 
""
That is all our products 
""
Therefore  that the processes
that we are using  is
same 
""
And technologically I don't think 
away or slightly different 
""
Only thing we may have  the
advancement  available in the
western countries may not be here  we have to use either a
human  not that
much of computerization
