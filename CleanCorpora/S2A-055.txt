So this is the first  to rotate

Stay there with normal breathing 
and turn the diaphragm from the right to the left  in order to feel the
spine more

When you secure that pose  behind
the right  and keep it
like a stick  the right arm facing the fingers against the ground
inserting into the knees 
""
Then  against the upper hand
revolve the pubic  and the top
trunk

rotation 
""
Revolve the spine to the maximum  and set the kidney into the
kidney  for it to
function better

""
Without changing the leg  so
that both side  which has tremendous
room  we have no compression of the
spine

Hence it is called the lateral rotation of the spinal movement of
