<I>
Up till now we have seen the semi- poses and some
other bends 
Today we are showing you bharadwaja asana 
Before going into the way of doing it I would like
you all to see so that you can get the imprint of the 
asana 
You can look now into the pose music 
This asana is dedicated to Sage Bharadwaja
 the father of Drona the preceptor Kauravas and Pandavas who
fought the great Mahabharata war 
As you look at this pose it will tell you that we have 
the forward movement and the extension backwards of the spine 
But we do very little about the lateral movements of the spine 
So this is the first primary asana to rotate
the lateral muscles of the spine so that the spinal muscles on the
side are strengthen so that it prevents what we call today the split
disc cases 
Now we go into the technique of the pose 
First one has to sit in danda asana as you see
Here the foot should be vertically doing tada asana
 and the legs should be doing horizontal tada asana
 
So that the whole leg from the hips are like a stick 
After sitting in that pose flex your knees move the
feet towards the right feet placing the right foot over the left
foot which gives a grip or a support or an anchor for
rotating the spine to the maximum or optimum level 
Again repeating reach the right hand towards the ceiling
 extend the upper form from the right feet and revolve the trunk
even maximum from forty-five to fifty or sixty degrees 
Without disturbing the left knee and the hip so that
the knee and the hip run parallel to each other 
Then along with exhalation bring the right arm down 
Form a cup shape then take the left hand back near the
elbow and revolve using your behind as a friction 
Revolve your spine from the pubic towards the right hand 
and adjust your spine from the tail bone to the neck so that all
the thirty-three vertebrates of the spine get an even rotation 
Stay there with normal breathing lifting the lever up 
and turn the diaphragm from the right to the left in order to feel the
spine more 
When you secure that pose bring the left arm behind
the right and catch the right arm above the elbow and keep it
like a stick the right arm facing the fingers against the ground
inserting into the knees 
Then pressurising your finger against the upper hand
revolve the pubic the lowest trunk the middle trunk and the top
trunk and stay at the left shoulder to the maximum 
This gives you an idea that how the spine moves side
ways more and more which relieves soreness of the back lumbago 
one word hip pain and adjust the body in such a way that it
lessens the pain and relieves it 
Similarly the pose has to be done on the other side releasing
the hand bringing it to the front take the right arm back come
to danda asana 
Stay for a while do normal breathe one or two then with
an exhalation move the feet nearer flex in and move towards the left
hip 
Pressurising the knee on the ground walking the right outer
knee and the right hip to keep them run parallel to each other 
bring the left arm above stretch extend the body maximum 
revolving the trunk towards the right arm to the maximum 
Without retarding the rotation back bring the arm down
along with the exhalation 
Keep a cup cup shape move the right
arm back and pressurising your foot against the other foot turn the
lowest trunk to the maximum 
Lock the ligaments of the knees 
There they should be compressed in order to get the
rotation 
Revolve the spine to the maximum and set the kidney into the
kidney so that the blood is sucked by the kidney for it to
function better 
I just see it's the simplest of all asana
 but the effect is enormous 
Any person who have got a slip disc can begin this pose like
this before they attempt any other pose 
Here the fibre which picks the spine is taken off 
And it gives a tremendous relief on the back 
Then with an exhalation move the left arm back and catch
your leg no I'm sorry hold it catch your hand behind
Extend the left arm to the floor using the finger to
pressurise grip revolve the spin coming to shoulder the shoulder blade
the kidney the weight even the bladder should be lifted up and then
to be revolved 
This is the final pose 
Then you come back revolve release the finger 
Take the left arm on the back side of the hip on the left 
remove the leg to the front this is danda asana 
When there is a back ache people having slip disc 
it's very very difficult to do on this floor because they cannot
 move their bodies at all 
In order to make them get the mobility we make them to do
on a chair which you are going to see now 
You take a chair near you insert your legs on the path
of your chair 
Sit firmly on the seat 
Then catching on one edge of the armpit supporting the
elbow as you see keep the other hand behind grip the corner of
seat pick the support of your outer knees will contact with the leg of
the chair and turn your spine to the maximum 
And this is a real panacea for people who have got salip
disc or who are in the process of getting injury to their spine 
one word of the spine 
This can be done on the other way also
Without changing the leg you turn and we revolve so
that both side you can see this spine now better which has tremendous
room because when we sit on a chair we have no compression of the
spine 
It gives a tremendous room for the spine to revolve or to
rotate 
Hence it is called the lateral rotation of the spinal movement of
this arthrites 
Those who have back aches strain or pa 
 pain they can do this pose conveniently anywhere on the chair
Your relief today is a permanent cure forever provided
it is continued regularly 
So keep this in mind as the doctor says take four
doses a day if you do this pose with an interval of one hour every
now and then the soreness of the thigh pad disappears and there is
a tremendous freedom for the movement and you'll recover from
the disease sooner than one anticipates namaskar god
bless you 
 Today namaskar today we are
showing parshwathana asana 
 As I said before it's good to have a look 
into the pose to get a mental picture of parshwathana asana
 
 Now you can look at them music 
 This is parshwathana asana parshwa means side
 thana means stretch 
 From there we go to prasavika padastha asana 
 This is step pose to parshwathana aasana 
 I hope you got a mental picture of 
parshwathana asana and prasavika padastha asana 
 Now we are going into the way of doing presenting this
pose 
 First we have to stand in tada asana as you see it
 When we do tada asana remember that the bottom
feet should be very very active the skin should be very sensitive at the
bottom 
 You know the pointer which you see that's the brain of
the foot that should be circularly curved in order to get a firm
grip which help the shin and the thymus to come in 
 Then extending evenly from the middle of the arch we
have to stand erect 
 Then we do namaskar normally saluting to
one to the other 
 Namaskar this is how we salute the
soul of the other person at the same time saluting our self 
 It has to be done in the same way from behind 
 Let the body turn 
 Spread the palm take the pa join the palms to the back
 allow the fingers upward and then raise the fingers to the maximum
to reach the upper portion of the shoulder blade 
 And join the palms firmly into the wrist 
 Surely you have done that 
 Now if you look at this lady you see the two triangles
 evenly divided from the side of the chest to the lower and the
forearm forming a right angle triangle 
 So when a person presses the hands like that this perfect
 double trikon asan as we followed 
 In order to get it we have to press the wrist together and
push the forearm muscles towards the elbows descending the upper
arm down 
 This is very good for dropping shoulder and drooping
shoulder blade dislocated or displaced shoulder 
 And normally people suffer from tennis shoulder tennis elbows
tennis wrist were dependent get disturb of swollen 
 They dis they remove their swelling and are afraid to
hold their right hand to play again 
 Come to this side 
 Now the technique again 
 Take a deep inhalation jump about four to four and half feet apart
 Take the right foot out revolving the right foot forty-five to
 ninety degrees 
 The left foot about fifty to sixty degrees 
 Turn the trunk maximum towards the right so that the body
 experience on the middle of the right leg 
 The middle of the right foot on the side the middle of
the knee on the side the middle of the thigh on the side 
 If you take the flying your navel your diaphragm centre
 one word should run on the inner leg of the right 
 Extending both legs backwards pressing the right heel on the
floor extending the hinges of the heel of the right push back
the right in order to woken the left leg 
 Turn the pelvic rim of the left towards the right 
 Open your chest do normal breathing 
 When the breathing is not explained 
 Pressing your palms throw the head back now if you
achieve this pose it's called parshwauttana asana
parshwa means side uttana means extension 
 You can see the side legs side chest stretched 
 So extending the side legs of the body or raising the side
chest exhale go down 
 When you are going down see that the navel is brought
down to a vertical downward stretch of the navel 
 Turn the left leg towards the right and move the right outer
buttocks right outer buttocks towards the left leg 
 So that both the buttocks run parallel to the back wall
 Stretch your forehead on the knee if it is easy move
the head down then the nose then the legs 
 If you are secure stretching the outer edge of the left foot
 from the ankle downward towards the ground which is a gripper 
you have to turn the one word muscle of the left which is above the
knee towards the right 
 And extend this chin further down to rest on the shin 
shin is a lower bone of the leg 
 Then linken your body from the floor of the bladder 
 You should have a single stretch from the tail bone towards
the head 
 Doing normal breathe in that position you can see the side
legs working very accurately with full of life particularly the
inner right leg 
 Inhale come to the centre revolving the right foot again 
turning the left foot out 
 Stay there for a while in the centre 
 Take one or two breath then with an exhalation move to the
left turning the right foot in and the left foot out ninety degrees 
 Before you raise your head secure the right outer foot on
the platform firmly 
 And then raise your head up from the trunk and extending
this pelvic bladder from the right to the left lift up open
your chest throw the head back with normal breathing 
 Stay in that position for a while maintaining normal
breath 
 Then with an exhalation move the head down 
 You saw the pose when the head is lifted the whole uritary
organs were lifted up 
 So one word for the one word or the
looseness of the floor with the bladder there you get strengthen in this pose
 Extend further and further if you know if you can do better 
 Now pressing the left central heel of the flaw at the back 
open the knees more and more towards your right legs 
 And as the left leg moves back the right leg should give room 
by creating space for a perfect stretch
 You can see the clear triangle in the leg 
 And maintaining the triangle as a form stay there for a while
 Then after exhalation move the head to the centre turning the
left foot in 
 And stay there for a while 
 Do normal breathing 
 Then press this palms on the floor look up 
 When you look up spread your leg more and more after 
pressing the palm on the floor 
 Without disturbing the pubic bone the physiological organ 
from the pubic upto the neck has to be extended towards the collar
bone 
 Look up pressing the wrist 
 This helps tremendously to take a deep inbreathe 
without any strain 
 When exhale take the head down 
 Prasadita this is prasadita padasthana
asana prasadita means extended pada means leg
 as the legs are extended it is called prasadita pada uttana
asana means the head is brought down the floor with an intense
stretch 
 So it is prasadita padasthana asana 
 This is a base to begin shirsana 
many people are afraid to do shirshana becuase they are
afraid to keep their head down 
 So this asana trains the brain to get
acclimatise to keep the head to the ground then easily the confidence
come and they can practise shirsana 
 And this is a soothing both for the brain as the brain
gets tremendous blood supply in this position 
 In here we come up when you are staying in this pose you have
to maintain normal breathing 
 You can contract back begin the middle portion in the spine
into the body as seen as place the fingers on your back exhale both
together stand in tada asana
