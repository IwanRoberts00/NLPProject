<I>
""
""
Coming to the University 
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
Department rather
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Uh from fourteenth onwards 
""
""
Fourteenth 
""
""
 the central assessment
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
You no for M A 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
On 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And  talked to Dr Jagirdar
""
""
Yeah now I remember that one of your students 
 uh he remembers you all the time when he comes to me
""
""
""
""
""
I see ah ah 
""
""
Yeah very good friend of mine I mean 
yeah  he consults me for every other subject or for every his
personal difficulties with the other things also
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Yesterday he was here 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Day before yesterday
""
""
Yeah right 
""
""
And  he comes every other day
""
""
Yeah yeah ah 
""
""
He is a very good student
""
""
Ha he is a good student  very good student
 ah
""
""
""
""
""
But  I have started loosing interest in him
because 
""
""
He is not going to be a teacher 
""
""
Teacher any more he says 
 and go to grow some fruit garden
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah yeah that is what his 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I know 
""
Even when he was for his B A 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
You know there was a farewell function  to
be given to the students farewell to be given to the students
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And then 
and said that he wants to do he was a good student
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uh he said that you know after B A he doesn't want to do M A
""
agriculture and sort of things
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  I thought he would
pursue his studies and  encouraging him taking
Commonwealth Literature etcetera etcetera
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah ah ha 
""
""
At the beginning  but then he gave me a shock the other day
saying that  only he will complete his M A with American Literature
whatever he has in the first year
""
""
Yeah ha
""
""
And 
""
""
Yeah ah ha
""
""
So my 
""
""
Anyway I appreciated his point of view
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Because  it is not that you know all those
people who study English language and literature that they should go in for
teaching job
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
You know being an agriculturist is also nice  and then
educated and particularly knowing English  language and literature
very well
