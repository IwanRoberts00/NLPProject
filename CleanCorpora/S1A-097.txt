Uhm uhm 
Uh from fourteenth onwards 
Fourteenth onwards 
 For the central assessment
Uhm uhm
You no for M A I had been to the department 
Uhm 
On fourth 
Ah 
And talked to Dr Jagirdar
Yeah now I remember that one of your students Mr Kori 
 ah uh he remembers you all the time when he comes to me
 Ah 
I see ah ah yeah he is my student 
Yeah very good friend of mine I mean he became 
yeah I mean he consults me for every other subject or for every his
personal difficulties with the other things also
 Yeah 
Yeah
Yesterday he was here I mean 
Yeah
Day before yesterday
Yeah right 
And he comes every other day
Yeah yeah ah 
He is a very good student
Ha he is a good student uhm very good student
 right I know him ah
 Uhm 
But well I have started loosing interest in him
because he says he is not going to be a teacher 
He is not going to be a teacher 
Teacher any more he says he wants to go back to his uh 
 fields and go to grow some fruit garden
 Village 
Yeah yeah that is what his uh fancy there in his mind 
Yeah
I know 
Even when he was for his B A 
Uhm
You know there was a farewell function yeah to
be given to the students farewell to be given to the students
 Yeah 
Uhm 
And then he made a speech over there ah 
and said that he wants to do he was a good student
 Ah 
Yeah 
Uh he said that you know after B A he doesn't want to do M A
 uhm and wants to go back to his village and do 
agriculture and sort of things
 Uhm 
Yeah otherwise you know I thought he would
pursue his studies and I thought of encouraging him taking
Commonwealth Literature etcetera etcetera
 But you know 
Yeah ah ha 
At the beginning but then he gave me a shock the other day
saying that only he will complete his M A with American Literature
whatever he has in the first year
Yeah ha
And he will become an agriculturist 
Yeah ah ha
So my hope of uh 
Anyway I appreciated his point of view
Yeah
Because uhm it is not that you know all those
people who study English language and literature that they should go in for
teaching job
