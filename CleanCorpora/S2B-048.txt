Uh now before I go on to the way 
Indian writing in English got a new lease of life in the 
in the in the seventees uh it it got a new lease of life by
being a part of whatever you call Commonwealth Literature
 
I mean I want to talk about that a little later 
But before that I want to say one or two things about 
present critical responses to Indian writing in English 
 certain trends and possibilities you see 
I read a paper on this some time ago and I thought uh 
some of the things that I mentioned in the paper are relevant to our 
discussion in Indian writing in English 
Uhm in this paper first I take three poles 
I mean I say that we can uh uh arrange a critical
responses according to the three poles that are in Indian writing in
English 
One is related to the term Indian the
other is related to the term English and the third
is related to the term writing 
So I say let's first concentrate our attention on
the pole of English and survey the area of responses centred upon
it 
The early British responses are to be understood I think in the
context of the colonial situation that existed at that time 
characterised by the master-slave relationship tempered by the
teacher-student relationship of of uh liberal encouragement and
patronage 
You all know about the concept of The white 
man's burden 
The question is whether the British attitude was really 
what David McCutchion thought it was that of patronising approval 
And with David McCutchion who talks about Indian writing in English
and what the British thought of Indian writing in English 
 He he his uh he saw he thought that uh 
there is always a patronising approval there is a patronising attitude
 uh We are astonished he says not that it is
done well but that it is done at all 
Uh I'm sure David McCutchion judges his
Victorian eh uh compatriots like Edmund Gosse then M A H A L Fisher
 Arthur Symons Laurence Binyon and young W B Yeats rather
ungenerously attributing to them an attitude of superfluous 
superiority 
These are these were the people who talked about Indian writing
in English 
Uh uh you know Edmund Gosse wrote about uh uh Toru
Dutt poetry 
And he has referenced it to all these people who uh uh liked
Indian writing in English for one reason or another 
I do not think that Gosse was patting on Toru Dutt's 
back out of uh adulterated kindness born of parental
superiority 
If you look at what uh Gosse wrote about Toru Dutt he don't
uh find this uh this kind of patting it is genuine criticism 
Now this is what Gosse wrote to Toru Dutt Literature
has no honours which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl 
who at the age of twenty-one and in language separated from her own 
by so deep a chasm had produced so much of lasting worth 
When the history of literature of our own country comes to be
written there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile 
exotic blossom of songs 
Of course I mean uh he likes her for what she has written 
and also with the word that term exotic is important 
That she has a place in the history of English literature 
And uh he also likes her because of uh the the the
exoticism that she brings in through her poetry 
This surely is not a patronising approval 
It is uh serious criticism expressed with certain generosity
 without falsifying the truth of his judgement 
Now the second example that I give for such genuine kind
of uh response uh without any offence of pat 
 patronage uh or one word is that of 
Yeats's appreciation of Tagore's Gitanjali 
If you read uh I refer to this yesterday if you read uh
 Yeats's uh uh preface to Tagore's Gitanjali
 we find that uh this appreciation uh of Tagore his
appreciation of Tagore throbs with a singular sincerity of
response 
I quote The work of a supreme culture they
yet appear as mu as much the growth of
the common soil as the grass and the rushes 
A whole people a whole civilization immeasurably strange
to us 
Once again the the note of exoticism immeasurably strange to us 
 seems to have been taken up into this imagination and
yet we were moved because of the strangeness but because we have
 met our own image as though we had walked in Rossetti's 
 Willow wood or heard perhaps for the first time
in literature our voice as in a dream unquote 
What we had to accept is the sincerity and genuineness of
critical response in tune with the literary tradition to which the
critics belonged 
I don't see any exaggerated and patronising praise in for
example Graham Green's comparison of uh uh R K Narayan
 with Chekov or Herbert Read's faith in Shankar Mokashi
 Punekar's poetry or Milton Brown's comparison of
the chronicles of Kedaram with Main Street and Cranford 
The tradition of enthusiastic appreciation of Indian works in
English by western critics they include the Australian critics as well
 is a continous phenomenon which has to be accounted for I think 
phase-wise taking into consideration the changing context of Indian
writing in English 
The early phase was coloured by a certain self confessed 
generosity I mean we should agree 
Even though it is genuine there is a certain amount of self
conscious generosity 
And uh there was no question of misreading our Indian
Indo-English literature since it was well within the traditions of
English poetry with which they were familiar 
The so called exotic element in it might have cast a little spell
 but it was never blinding or binding so as to distort their
critical sense 
After Independence Indian writing in English
 achieved its identity as a viable body of literature 
The responses of people like Graham Greene William Walsh E
M Foster and Laurence Durrel were seized by us with avidity 
since they helped us in building up our confidence in the valley of
our literature soon
Thanks to the rise of uh Commonwealth literature
 in answer to the new political and cultural needs of the
erstwhile colonies of England Indian writing in English
 claimed a place legitimate and illegitimate at the same time
Legitimate because of the medium and illegitimate from the
point of view of the centrality of Indian experience uh obtained the
place in it and it was subjected to scholarly study of western and
Australian Commonwealth literature experts like Riemenschneider 
Keith uh uh Carelein Syd Harrex Haydn Moore Williams Dorothy
Spencer Kai Nicholson etcetera 
This post nineteen sixty criticism is characterised by a good
deal of misreading although it was based on well meaning laborous close
reading 
They misreading being the result of a lack of cultural
inwardness 
These critics trained in uh in the tradition of New
Criticism discover in our novelist patterns and layers of meaning
not easily visible to a norman normal Indian
reader 
Now I make this uh uhm po point
 with a reference to William Walsh what he wrote about R K
Narayan and also what uh uh some Australian critic wrote about
 Jejuri 
So Jejuri I mentioned yesterday today I'm going to say
something that William Walsh's response to R K Narayan's 
fiction and uh particularly you should r 
read in his book Commonwealth Literature 
his uh response to R K Narayan's Guide 
His response is sincere and subtle no doubt but the question is
 do the novels of uh R K Narayan really stand this over subtle and
over enthusiastic scrutiny ?
But then what is historically important is the western 
critic's joy of discovery which always colours their perceptions
In the case of Narayan's or Anand's fiction the
western reader finds an easy entry through ironic or realistic modes 
employed in it 
But it is when they encounter Raja Rao that they are
baffled 
David McCutchion for instance confesses frankly the
Anglo-Saxon mind does not understand India very well he says
With Aurobindo too they experience an opacity of response
Walsh for instance finds Aurobindo evasive 
constantly escaping the grapple of the western mind and
dismisses him by saying the importance of Aurobindo Ghosh
belongs rather to the history of ideas and of religion than literature
 
The Western critical sensibility loves irony realism
concreteness conflict and rigidity of form and it gets baffled and
frustrated when it faces something abstract apparently formless
 spiritual and mystical 
In the dialectics of critical process or to use Leacis's
 phrase in the collaborative effort of literary criticism this
honest bafflement has a significant role to play 
It leads to a healthy discussion of a literary and critical
assumptions and to certain important clarifications 
The bafflement of the western readers with regard to Raja Rao's
 fiction for instance particularly Serpent and the Rope
 and uh one word and Shakespear uh for instance
inspired Professor Narasimaih and Dr Na M K
Naik uh Narasimiah and Dr M K Naik's excellent
analyses of uh Raja Rao's works 
What is important is the livingness of the critical process 
which ultimately cannot be dis dissociated 
 from the process of culture or life in general 
Thanks to the fact that Indian writing in English
 is easily accessible to the western English speaking and
English knowing world because of the medium the western response has
grown into a tradition to such an extent that the western and Australian
critics can carry on their dialogue on Indian writing in
English without reference to Indian critics at all 
No other Indian literature enjoys this exposure to the outside
world which therefore tends to equate Indian writing in English with
Indian literature 
This has created an anomalous situation 
In Commonwealth studies literary conferences and festivals 
it is this Indian writing in English that gets 
national representation 
What is of relevance to the uh question we are discussing in
this seminar is the fact that the western response is a positive factor
 in the development of Indo-English literature and criticism 
With its enthusiasm its over estimation with its quest for
Indianness for Indian philosophical and esoteric speculations for
Indian sociological pecularities with its bafflements and limitations 
with its habits of close reading in search of deeper layers of meaning
 the western response adds a new dimension to our own critical
awareness which it keeps alive and kicking all the time 
 Let's now move uh uh to the pole represented
in term in the term Indian 
This uh of great signi significance
 in the context of the critical climate that we have been
talking about because it is the it is the uh centripetal
movement towards the roots 
As far as Indian writing in English is concerned the first 
uh big uh movement is to be discovered in Sri Aurobindo's 
criticism of his own poems and his critical remarks on fellow poetic
poets like Tagore 
Then I have uh talked about Aurobindo and how I mean during the
pre-independence period uh he was uh a a a an Indian
critic very conscious of his Indianess and uh he knew his western
 poet and western critics uh but still he has uh great faith in
the kind of uh new uh poetry that he was writing in epics like uh
 Savitri 
Uh yesterday I talked about uh this and so I don't want to
repeat this 
The attainment of independence was followed by a certain 
uneasiness towards English and Indo Eng 
Anglian literature as it was then called 
Uh a certain ambivalence of attitude towards English still
continues though Indo-English literature gained gradual acceptance
during the late fiftees and the sixtees 
The rise of the Commonwealth the concept of other literatures
in English uh the multiplication of uh universities and university
departments of English are some of the factor that changed the climate
for the development of Indian writing in English 
Yesterday also I I referred to the the uh the
multiplication of university departments of English because of which 
I mean the Indian writing in English uh got a
special place uh as far as research is concerned 
The growth of the thesis industry demanded complete
exploitation of the nearest and the most easily available area of research
The increase in the U G C and university supported seminars 
this is one of them uh conferences journals created a suitable
climate for intense critical activity in the area of Indian writing in
English 
The pioneering work of Professor K R Narsimh uh K R Srinivas
Iyengar uh in this area opened new vistas of critical studies and
research 
First the problem of English as a creative medium was thrashed
out after tremendous warfare of passions and the value of
Indo-English literature in the new national context of emergent Indian
literatures in re regional 
languages was questioned and after a good deal of uh discussion it
has been accepted to use Professor Narasimaih's words 
 not in a not as an exotic plant but as an expression of a
distinctive sensibility which is Indian
