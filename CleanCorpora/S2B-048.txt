Uh 
Indian writing in English 
in the  by
being a part of  Commonwealth Literature
""
""
I mean 
""
But before that 
present critical responses to 
""
""
I read a paper on this 
some of the things that I mentioned in the paper 
discussion in Indian writing in English 
""
Uhm 
""
I mean I say that we can uh  a critical
responses  according to the three poles that are in Indian writing in
English 
""
One is  the
other is related to the term  and the third
is related to the term 
""
So  on
the pole of English  centred upon
it 
""
The early British responses are to be understood  I think in the
context of the 
characterised by the  tempered by the
teacher-student relationship  of uh liberal encouragement and
patronage 
""
You all know 
man's 
""
The question is whether the British attitude 
what David McCutchion thought it was 
""
And with David McCutchion who talks about Indian writing in English
and what the British thought of Indian writing in English 
""
""
there is always a patronising approval  there is a patronising attitude
 not that it is
done well 
""
Uh  his
Victorian eh uh compatriots  then M A H A L Fisher
 rather
ungenerously 
superiority 
""
These are these were the people  who talked about Indian writing
in English 
""
Uh  uh Toru
Dutt 
""
And he has referenced it to all these people who  uh uh liked
Indian writing in English for 
""
I do not think that Gosse was 
back  parental
superiority 
""
If you look at what uh  he don't
uh 
""
Now this is what Gosse wrote to Toru Dutt  Literature
has no honours 
who at the age of twenty-one 
by so deep a chasm 
""
When the history of literature of our own country comes to be
written 
exotic 
""
Of course I mean uh 
and also with the word that term exotic is important 
""
That she has a place in the history of English literature 
""
And uh  the
exoticism 
""
This surely is not a patronising approval 
""
It is uh serious criticism expressed  with certain generosity
""
""
Now  for such genuine kind
of uh response 
""
Yeats's 
""
""
If you read  uh
 Gitanjali
 uh of Tagore his
appreciation of Tagore  sincerity of
response 
""
I quote  they
yet appear  the growth of
the common soil 
""
A whole people  immeasurably strange
to us 
""
Once again the the note of exoticism immeasurably strange to us 
 and
yet  but because we have
""
 perhaps for the first time
in literature 
""
What we had to accept is  and genuineness of
critical response  to which the
critics belonged 
""
I don't see any exaggerated and patronising praise  in for
example  R K Narayan
 faith in Shankar Mokashi
 of
the chronicles of Kedaram 
""
The tradition of enthusiastic appreciation of Indian works  in
English by western critics  they include the Australian critics as well
""
phase-wise  the changing context of Indian
writing in English 
""
The early phase was coloured 
generosity 
""
Even though it is genuine  self
conscious generosity 
""
And uh  our Indian
Indo-English literature  since it was well within the traditions of
English poetry 
""
The so called exotic element in it might have cast a little spell
 their
critical sense 
""
After Independence  Indian writing in English
""
""
The responses of people like Graham Greene  E
M Foster 
since they helped us in building up  in the valley of
our literature  soon
""
Thanks to the rise of uh  Commonwealth literature
 the
erstwhile colonies of England  Indian writing in English
 legitimate and illegitimate at the same time
""
""
Legitimate because of the medium  and illegitimate from the
point of view of the centrality of Indian experience  uh obtained the
place in it  of western and
Australian 
Keith uh  Dorothy
Spencer 
""
This post nineteen sixty criticism  is characterised by a good
deal of misreading  although it was based on well meaning laborous close
reading 
""
They misreading  being the result of a lack of cultural
inwardness 
""
These critics  in the tradition of New
Criticism  patterns and layers of meaning
not easily visible  Indian
reader 
""
Now  point
 what he wrote about R K
Narayan  some Australian critic wrote about
""
""
So Jejuri I mentioned yesterday  going to say
something that William 
fiction 
read 
his uh response to R K 
""
His response is sincere and subtle  no doubt but the question is
 and
over enthusiastic scrutiny  ?
""
But then 
critic's  which always colours their perceptions
""
""
In the case of  fiction the
western reader finds 
employed in it 
""
But it is  that they are
baffled 
""
David McCutchion for instance  the
Anglo-Saxon mind does not understand India very well  he says
""
""
With Aurobindo too  an opacity of response
""
""
Walsh for instance finds Aurobindo 
constantly escaping the grapple of the western mind  and
dismisses him by saying  Ghosh
belongs rather to the history of ideas and of religion  than literature
""
""
The Western critical sensibility  realism
concreteness  and it gets baffled and
frustrated  apparently formless
""
""
In the dialectics of critical process  Leacis's
 this
honest bafflement has a significant role to play 
""
It leads  to a healthy discussion of a literary and critical
assumptions 
""
The bafflement of the western readers with regard to Raja  Rao's
 Serpent and the Rope
 uh for instance
inspired Professor Narasimaih  M K
Naik  excellent
analyses of uh 
""
What is important is the livingness of the critical process 
which ultimately cannot be 
""
""
Thanks to the fact that  Indian writing in English
 to the western English speaking and
English knowing world  the western response has
grown into a tradition  to such an extent that the western and Australian
critics can carry on their dialogue  Indian writing in
English 
""
No other Indian literature enjoys this exposure to the outside
world  Indian writing in English with
Indian literature 
""
This has created 
""
In Commonwealth studies 
it is this 
national representation 
""
What is of relevance to the  uh question we are discussing in
this seminar  is the fact that the western response is a positive factor
""
""
With its enthusiasm its over estimation  with its quest for
Indianness  for
Indian sociological pecularities 
with its habits of close reading in search of  deeper layers of meaning
 own critical
awareness 
""
 represented
in term 
""
This uh  significance
 the critical climate that we have been
talking about  centripetal
movement 
""
As far as Indian writing in English is concerned 
uh big uh movement is to be discovered 
criticism of his own  and his critical remarks on fellow poetic
poets like Tagore 
""
Then I have uh talked about Aurobindo  and how I mean during the
pre-independence period  an Indian
critic very conscious of his Indianess  he knew his western
 great faith in
the kind of uh  in epics like uh
""
""
Uh  yesterday I talked about uh this and so I don't want to
repeat this 
""
The attainment of independence 
uneasiness towards English 
Anglian 
""
Uh a certain ambivalence of attitude towards English still
continues  gradual acceptance
during the late 
""
The rise of the Commonwealth  the concept of other literatures
in English  universities and university
departments of English  are some of the factor that changed the climate
for the development of Indian writing in English 
""
Yesterday also I  uh the
multiplication of university departments of English 
I mean the  uh got a
special place 
""
The growth of the thesis industry demanded  complete
exploitation of the nearest and the most easily available area of research
""
""
The increase in the U G C and university supported seminars 
this is one of them  journals created a suitable
climate for intense critical activity  in the area of Indian writing in
English 
""
The pioneering work of Professor K R Narsimh uh K R  Srinivas
Iyengar  uh in this area opened new vistas of critical studies and
research 
""
First the problem of English as a creative medium  was thrashed
out after tremendous  and the value of
Indo-English literature  in the new national context of emergent Indian
literatures 
languages was questioned  it
has been accepted 
 but as an expression of a
distinctive sensibility
