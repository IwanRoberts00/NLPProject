<I>
See yesterday I ran into Smita 
So uhm her friend Laxshmi she was suffering from her father
was suffering from asthama 
So here he has been admitted in the Hospital somewhere in
Rajarampuri 
So
Who is the doctor 
Some Irani Irani 
So I checked the reports of his blood you know all were
normal 
But the doctor is saying there's a pu puss
formation in the lungs
Yeah 
So I asked him I asked him what treatment does
 is he going to give 
So his thinking is that it can be removed only by surgery 
But we can do even homeopathy for that
Yeah I know 
 Homeopathy is the best treatment you know 
 I've even I was telling her the same thing 
But then she said ki I said see the puss
formation is going to take place again after the surgery uhm
And asthama is such a disease that it can be
completely cured by homeopathy only
 Uhm 
 Disease 
 Homeopathy 
You just ad advise her then if if she wants
But her father you know he he is against restrictions of
eating and drinking like he wants to drink coffee all the
time 
He drinks at least ten cups of coffee 
 Yeah 
But that is an antidote again 
Yeah
Coffee coffee and onion raw onion 
 Onion 
That is an anitidote na 
You can try again because if the performance is 
it can be cured 
 Asthama can be cured in a sense asthama and
But he is not ready to listen na 
Uhm uhm that's why 
He doesn't listen only
But you can try again
Very stubborn person laughter 
We can try again 
 What's wrong in trying again 
I don't know they had referred to some doctor 
But then he doesn't pay attention to all this na
 all these things you don't drink coffee or eat raw onion
etcetra
Only these two things and what else he has to follow 
Do you think you know what he thinks actually he doesn't
believe in homeopathy cough there lies his problem
People don't know about homeopathy
Yeah that's why 
 That's it na so I told him 
ki Shireen's dad was also suffering from asthama 
Even Shireen was even saying ki 
her dad was suffering from asthama and cough uh one of her uncles is
a homeopath 
He was a allopath before but then afterwards he studied
homeopath and now he is a pure homeopath 
 Even 
There are many people that way
Yeah even Dr Shinde etcetra 
So then uh like Shireen's father was cured by 
his uncle na 
 Yeah 
Her uncle
Her uncle
Even my mummy
Now he is not at all suffering from asthama you know not
at all
Yeah why don't you try to convince him 
I I didn't try to convince him I tried to convince Laxshmi
First of all you will have to convince Laxshmi
Yeah
Yeah we can even one or two words family there are
 pe people
You should have said ki what's the
harm of trying just trying it 
 There's no side effects of homeopathy 
Anyway he's not going to get ano another disease
He doesn't believe in that that small one word 
 One or two words 
Those are going to create a effect and that his asthama
 which is almost I mean it's very chronic that is going
to disappear 
 We can take him to some doctor like 
 who who are the renowned homeopath in Kolhapur
 Shinde and all na 
 Yeah 
Maybe they will uh convince him
Because that
Because finally what are in his we don't have any uh I
mean we don't want to earn and all that we just want to cure like that
Yeah that's what the thing is 
We can take him to a homeopath 
We can ask the homeopath to make that interest in that person
 because at this age if he if it is one word than a surgery 
 uhm 
I don't suppose he will uh get again the uh health and all the
things back
 Uhm 
And now he is quite old no
Yeah that's what
Yeah
At this age if is he going to have any surgery 
 He's almost seventy over 
Seven no sixty-five 
Sixty-five
Still but won't be able to reg regain all his health
Yeah that is also true 
Even my mummy is suffering was suffering from rheumatism
 na she has taken
Rheumatism is other horrible disease
Yeah Rheumatism and we cured by allopathy
No there are some diseases you know like which
can be cured by homeopathy only
 She had taken the treatment 
Yeah only homoeopathy
And the one is the is the uh rheumatism 
 Rheumatism 
Rheumatism
Then skin diseases stones kidney stones you know I am
telling you yeah only homeopathy can cure it 
 Yeah 
The stones can be passed to the urine only by homeopathic
medicine
But that is one problem the people don't believe in
homeopathy still 
But now-a-days many people are diverting to
homeopathy 
 But the even the allopth is preferred
But that is only in the urban uh cities 
Yeah precisely they are MBS actually MBBS no
Yeah 
Then 
But giving a homeopathic treatment
In the rural areas yeah
These propoganda should be made na about
homeopathy 
 Let's see when we become doctors 
 We'll try
 We'll try our level best
Actually right from now we should start the start I mean
uh to
Yeah creating
I mean we should as soon as we learn one word we
should start giving the medicine know 
We should let other people know importance of homeopathy and
how it cure up the disease 
Even mental symptoms can be cured by homeopathy
Yeah
Yeah psycho psycho
Yeah 
 One word 
Because each each persons constitution is different 
Allopathy
Allopathy what they do what they do you know
 like know we all are suffering from a common disease say
fever 
They will give the same disease uh same medicine to everyone 
 like 
But homeopathy doesn't see that first he will know her
constitution is weak your constitution is tough 
So it depends na like for her I'll 
give some else medicine the doctor will give you something else 
 No you one word 
 Yeah 
I know that is a one word 
When they give preference to physical over individual
constitution as well as mental constitution 
We can find even uh each and every constitution we see
 the crowd also we can get many yeah definitely 
 Yeah 
And we can distinguish between them 
I hope
But the homeopath has to have that knowledge over
the material
Material and uh 
Yeah
If he is wrong somewhere whole practice is going to
But actually homeopathy has no side effects na
 so
But still
So when that one is going to ha happen
and we have one or two word 
 One or two words 
But by reputation you can do it
But he has to have his reputation 
If the one word if he gets
No yaar now even I a normal doctor 
like even a MBBS doctor he takes five years yaar to
settle himself in any town or a city 
But he has to increase the power in that patient
like today
Today one word sir was not saying or what if you
treat one patient he will go on telling all the all the people
Yeah yeah
And he will create a broad board of you that this is the
doctor he will refer all the patient go to this doctor and all that 
 that's there and then you become famous 
 That's there 
You may have the tact yaar 
Really
Tact is two words 
I think Mane sir has that tact you know
Yeah
See he has got the 
And Pratap Kulkarni 
Pratap Kulkarni he is also very
 He's an homeopath
Then what 
I didn't know that
 A few words 
Of course he was a student from
No he was not
No no 
He was from our college 
 He's a good homeopath 
Yeah
I didn't know yaar really 
Even I one or two words 
But how come
He used to come
I knew about Pratap Kulkarni but I didn't know that 
he's a homeopath
No I didn't knew 
And he used to come na during the 
time of our strike and all that 
 Yeah 
That was a very bad phase of our life 
Horrible 
Horrible 
Strike laughter 
I just want don't want to think about it
I wish I would write a autobiography of myself about my
medical education you know laughter uh ten year plan with two years
of uh having a strike yeah and the remaining six years
because I I was in the strike and a few words 
Really it was a horrible scene
 Yeah 
And remaining because I didn't study laughter 
I hope our colleague student don't come with us that
class missed
I swear 
 One or two words 
How could we face one word my god horrible
What do you think he'll come or not
 One or two words 
I don't think 
I think he'll come
He personally is not interested or uh
His parents are not interested
He personally is not interested his parents are interested
More probably his mother is interested in sending him
Then what is the one or two words 
Because she is not
Instead of doing D A yeah D S M is more 
better I think
 Yeah 
No actually he just wants a degree yaar 
 he always one word hospital yeah 
 That too a few words he is already a
settled doctor he needs just needs a degree
He knows all the practical appliances everything 
Even
Yeah
How to give an injection to give I V this that
Yeah he sits in in his father's hospital not
a clinic
 It's a hospital only
Yeah I think
Even she must be
Well let him not come of course let him do D S M
And he's going to waste all his certificates 
Yeah he's not going to get back his certificates and
money na 
Thats right
That is okay
Instead of wasting thirty thousand and again fifty
thousand in one word 
Yeah now he'll have to give donation in D H M S
College also
 He's not going to get it just plainly like
that
 You know they are asking fifty thousand 
 He's getting in free seat
No
No somebody told me
What about Archana
 She's taken her Archana she's
 taken some short course computer and
 Archana 
One year course
She can complete her this thing graduation
No but uh about her L C and certificate 
 That will also take take a long time 
And I think she will take out duplicate 
Duplicate from where
Bombay
Bombay
We get
Then how they got their mark list and leaving certificate
in duplicate
That is the main thing when you get a mark list you get a
leaving certificate that's what I enquired you know 
But again that caste certificate problem has arrived na
She will do when she have when she will have to take a
passport for this thing backward one word certificate
 Certificates na 
But if you need a for the passport you need one word 
duplicate do 
No I don't suppose but you need always orignals
If she has a passport it's well and good otherwise great
problem yaar 
 Yeah 
That she has I think
Therfore she has to she will have to take help from her
father-in-law 
Yeah that way her father-in-law is quite 
But it's better ki have an original
I know now it's impossible
