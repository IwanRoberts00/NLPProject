""
""
See yesterday I ran into Smita 
""
So uhm  her father
was suffering from asthama 
""
So here he has been admitted in the Hospital somewhere in
Rajarampuri 
""
So
""
""
Who is the doctor 
""
""
Some Irani Irani 
""
So  all were
normal 
""
But the doctor is saying  puss
formation in the lungs
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So I asked him  does
""
""
So his thinking is that 
""
""
But we can do  even homeopathy for that
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But then she said  I said see the puss
formation is going to  uhm
""
""
And asthama is such a  that it can be
completely cured by  only
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You just  if if she wants
""
""
But her father you know he  he is against restrictions of
eating and drinking  coffee all the
time 
""
He drinks at least ten cups of coffee 
""
""
""
""
""
But that is an antidote again 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Coffee coffee and 
""
""
""
""
""
That is an anitidote 
""
You can try again 
it can be cured 
""
""
 in a sense asthama and
""
""
But he is not ready to listen 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
He doesn't listen only
""
""
But you can try again
""
""
Very stubborn person 
""
""
We can try again 
""
""
""
""
""
I don't know they had referred to some doctor 
""
But then he doesn't  na
 you don't drink coffee or eat raw onion
etcetra
""
""
Only these two things and what else he has to follow 
""
""
Do you think you know what he thinks actually he doesn't
believe in homeopathy  there lies his problem
""
""
People don't know about homeopathy
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
ki 
""
Even Shireen was 
her dad was suffering from asthama and  uh one of her uncles is
a homeopath 
""
He was a allopath before  but then afterwards he studied
homeopath and now he is a pure homeopath 
""
""
""
""
""
There are many people that way
""
""
Yeah even Dr Shinde 
""
So then 
his uncle 
""
""
""
""
""
Her uncle
""
""
Her uncle
""
""
Even my mummy
""
""
Now he is not at all suffering from asthama you know  not
at all
""
""
Yeah why don't you try to convince him 
""
""
I I didn't try to convince him  I tried to convince Laxshmi
""
""
First of all you will have to convince Laxshmi
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Yeah we can even  family there are
 people
""
""
You should have said  the
harm of trying just trying it 
""
""
""
""
Anyway  another disease
""
""
He doesn't believe in that 
""
""
""
""
""
Those are going to create a effect  and that his asthama
 that is going
to 
""
""
""
 Kolhapur
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Maybe they will  uh convince him
""
""
Because that
""
""
Because finally what are in his  I
mean we don't want to earn and all that  we just want to cure like that
""
""
Yeah 
""
We can take him to a homeopath 
""
We can ask the homeopath to  make that interest in that person
""
""
""
I don't suppose he will uh get again the uh health and all the
things back
""
""
""
""
""
And now he is quite old no
""
""
Yeah  what
""
""
Yeah
""
At this age if is he going to have any surgery 
""
""
""
""
""
Seven no sixty-five 
""
""
Sixty-five
""
""
Still but won't be able to  regain all his health
""
""
""
Yeah that is also true 
""
""
Even my mummy is suffering  was suffering from rheumatism
 she has taken
""
""
Rheumatism is other horrible disease
""
""
Yeah Rheumatism and we cured by allopathy
""
""
No  you know like which
can be cured by homeopathy only
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah only homoeopathy
""
""
And the one is the is the uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Rheumatism
""
""
Then skin diseases stones  kidney stones you know I am
telling you 
""
""
""
""
""
The stones can be passed to the urine only by  homeopathic
medicine
""
""
But that is one problem the people don't believe in
homeopathy still 
""
""
But now-a-days many people are diverting  to
homeopathy 
""
""
 the allopth is preferred
""
""
But that is only in the urban uh cities 
""
""
Yeah precisely they are MBS actually MBBS no
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Then 
""
""
But giving a homeopathic treatment
""
""
In the rural areas  yeah
""
""
These propoganda should be made  about
homeopathy 
""
""
""
""
 try
""
""
 try our level best
""
""
Actually right from now we should start the start  I mean
uh to
""
""
Yeah creating
""
""
I mean we should as soon as we learn  we
should start giving the medicine know 
""
""
We should let other people know importance of homeopathy and
how 
""
""
Even mental symptoms can be cured by homeopathy
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Yeah psycho psycho
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
Because each 
""
""
Allopathy
""
""
Allopathy  what they do you know
 say
fever 
""
They will give the same disease uh same medicine to everyone 
""
""
But homeopathy doesn't see that  first he will know her
constitution is weak your constitution is tough 
""
So it depends 
give some else 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I know that is a 
""
""
When they give preference to  over individual
constitution as well as mental constitution 
""
""
We can find even uh  each and every constitution we see
""
""
""
""
""
""
And we can distinguish between them 
""
""
I hope
""
""
But the homeopath has to  over
the material
""
""
Material and uh 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
If he is wrong somewhere  whole practice is going to
""
""
But actually homeopathy has no side effects  na
 so
""
""
But still
""
""
So when that  happen
and we have 
""
""
""
""
""
But by reputation you can do it
""
""
But he has to have his reputation 
""
If the  if he gets
""
""
No 
like even a MBBS doctor  to
settle himself 
""
""
But he has to increase the  patient
like today
""
""
Today  if you
treat one patient he will go on telling all the all the people
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
And he will create a broad board of you that this is the
doctor 
""
""
""
""
""
""
You may have the tact 
""
""
Really
""
""
Tact is 
""
""
I think Mane sir has that tact you know
""
""
Yeah
""
""
See he has got the 
""
""
And Pratap Kulkarni 
""
""
Pratap Kulkarni  he is also very
""
""
 an homeopath
""
""
Then what 
""
""
I didn't know that
""
""
""
""
""
Of course he was a student from
""
""
No he was not
""
""
No no 
""
""
He was from our college 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
I didn't know 
""
""
Even I 
""
""
But how come
""
""
He used to come
""
""
I knew about Pratap Kulkarni 
he's  a homeopath
""
""
No I didn't knew 
""
""
And he used to come 
time 
""
""
""
""
""
That was a very bad phase of our life 
""
""
Horrible 
""
""
Horrible 
""
""
Strike 
""
""
I just want don't want to think about it
""
""
I wish I would write a autobiography of myself  about my
medical education you know  uh ten year plan with two years
of uh  and the remaining six years
because I 
""
Really it was a horrible scene
""
""
""
""
""
And remaining because I didn't study 
""
""
I hope our colleague student don't come with us  that
class missed
""
""
I swear 
""
""
""
""
""
How could we face  horrible
""
""
What do you think  come or not
""
""
""
""
""
I don't think 
""
""
I think  come
""
""
He personally is not interested or uh
""
""
His parents are not interested
""
""
He personally is not interested his parents are interested
""
More probably his mother is interested in sending him
""
""
Then what is the 
""
""
Because she is not
""
""
Instead of doing D A 
better I think
""
""
""
""
""
No actually he just wants a degree 
""
""
""
 he is already a
settled doctor he needs  just needs a degree
""
""
He knows all the practical appliances everything 
""
Even
""
""
Yeah
""
""
How to give an injection to give I V this that
""
""
Yeah  not
a clinic
""
""
 a hospital only
""
""
Yeah I think
""
Even she must be
""
""
Well let him not come  of course let him do D S M
""
""
And 
""
""
Yeah  not going to get back his certificates and
money 
""
""
Thats right
""
""
That is okay
""
""
Instead of wasting thirty thousand  and again fifty
thousand in 
""
""
Yeah now  have to give donation in D H M S
College also
""
 just plainly like
that
""
""
""
""
""
 getting in free seat
""
""
No
""
""
No somebody told me
""
""
What about Archana
""
""
 she's
 computer and
""
""
""
""
""
One year course
""
""
She can complete her  this thing graduation
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
And I think she will take out duplicate 
""
""
Duplicate  from where
""
""
Bombay
""
""
Bombay
""
""
We get
""
""
Then how they got their mark list and  leaving certificate
in duplicate
""
""
That is the main thing  when you get a mark list you get a
leaving certificate 
""
But again that caste certificate problem has arrived  na
""
""
""
She will do when she have when she will have to take a
passport  certificate
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if you need a for the passport you need 
duplicate do 
""
""
No I don't suppose  orignals
""
""
If she has a passport  well and good otherwise great
problem 
""
""
""
""
""
That she has I think
""
""
Therfore she has to she will have to take help from her
father-in-law 
""
""
Yeah that way her father-in-law is quite 
""
""
But  have an original
""
""
I know
