<I>
Well Dr Nihalani we got a number of uh articles uh
 made of wood just half an hour back what do you think about these
 ?
 Ashok is it ?
I think they are quite good 
Good and cheap 
Uh I think one of the reasons why we liked them was
that uh they were brought to one word and the other thing
was that they were very nice and uh we could use them as a
presents to our relatives and friends 
Don't you think so ?
Yes a very reasonably priced 
And uh items were all very compact 
Oh yes 
 That's what uh I I like them
immensely 
 Uh 
What do you think about our visit to Dhanyalok the other
day that is last Sunday ?
It was quite uplifting I should say uh to be there
 uh it was a lovely evening we spent with Dr C D N 
yes 
Uh the warm hospitality yeah 
And uh that pleasant environment yeah uh 
was real good that I should say 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Wasn't it a very memorable and treasurable experience ?
Yes of course
Yes 
Uh especially when you are from we were made to sit uh
 in the in vichar yeah in the in the
 Sanjay Vichara Mantapum when then we had 
tea in the garden and then Dr C D N uh talked to us about
several things yeah including poetry thesis poetry 
 yeah 
And uh well his first encounter with T S Eliot 
 yeah 
Now well this was really absorbing very interesting
 uhm
 In vichar 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Well everytime we even see C D N everytime we talk to him
 yeah we find that well we are energised and we feel
inspired and at same time we feel that we have to do quite a lot 
 Yeah 
As compared to what he does 
Then he also uhm you know gave us a copy of Brindavanam 
 yeah the new periodical started and then the recent issue of
 Literary Criterion 
Uh number one is tour of nineteen ninety-three 
 uhm which uh has a I mean which has special number on
 the drama in post graduate they conducted uh sometime back 
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
And he was quite encouraging you know to one word 
uh and at work yes uh Dhanyalok to be just one man
show 
 Yes 
Yes
He said he's seventy-three now
Oh yes
Doing an extremely useful work 
Certainly he
In the field of English studies and indigenous arts
Yes 
And I felt terribly inspired yes and uh 
that even at that age after retirement yes one can do lots
of good things
 Yes 
 Yes 
Yes 
So to me it was extremely uplifting and educative 
yes I must say 
 Yes 
Uh another thing
Yeah, so please continue 
 A another thing is that he uh he enc 
 uh encourages the scholars to come out there and uh read uh on
their own 
Maybe uh concerning with their research topics or
 maybe the literature of their interest yeah because
he has a number of books on Commonwealth Literature 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Certainly he has a 
 And a 
He has a very good library in fact
And at the same time I suppose uh there is a good place to
sit also
Yes
Especially in the library hall
Library hall the sitting arrangement
The round table
The sitting arrangement is quite good 
 Quite good 
And then there are number of photographs also you must have
seen 
And he has the photograph of his teacher uh Dr F R Levis
Yes yes 
Hey you know these scholars are very well looked after
Yes
Uhm as members of uh his family
Yes
I have uh an occasion Dr Inamdar's in Aurangabad
 oh yes his wife 
He was uh there for about a week
Uh wanted to consult books on Commonwealth Literature
 Oh yes 
Right yes
Uh they were all admiration for the man and for his
family
Certainly yes
You see and besides uh the the guidence that he got 
here in the subject
Uhm I very much remember you know the warm hospitality and
affection that they
Oh yes oh yes we remember uhm yeah
 one or two words 
Everyone who stays with them has very fond memories of their
stay and uh there you know happy moments of talk and discussions
 That's true 
I think there is also his assistant by his uh son and his
sister-in-law
Yeah one of his
And few others
Daughters-in-law
Yeah daughter-in-law sorry
And uh some of his uh grand children
Yeah some of the grand children also yes
So uhm
Yes it it was memorable uhn experience through
Uh so one really feels like visiting Mysore 
uhm especially for this purpose of uh visiting Brindavan and uh 
 Uhm 
Another advantage is it's quite close to Manas
Gangotri one word 
Uhm the university campus
University campus of Mysore 
So it's really situated at an ideal place
So that was one of my
It is uh far away from the noise and bustle and one word
 tumble of the town 
And uh
Well it's an ideal place for meditation and study
room
I very much wanted to visit the place
And I'm glad I've been able to
Yeah 
Uhm also that one word Central Institute Of
Indian Languages 
Yes
Uhm I enjoyed my visit to that place too
Yes
Ah that way yeah some usual work
 Yeah 
Certainly 
Another thing is that we were very fortunate in having uh two
visits to Brindavan
Yeah especially when I uh well I had stayed over here for
a month
Yeah and uh I think we could consider ourselves fortunate in
having these two visits
So that we have uh have very close that a few words
 and especially he gave us lot of information about that
Yeah
Uhm he gave us that one word also yeah
 two words and he mentioned uh I think you saw him 
didn't you ?
 Yeah 
Well yes I was chanced to walk there P G teacher on
the evening alone 
That was quite sometime ago
Yeah a couple of years ago I suppose 
Yeah so quite well done that was also 
collected
Yeah
We mentioned of that and uh 
Yeah 
When you mentioned it to Dr Cyrian he was also there I think
Yeah 
And uh yeah this is one of the institute in India uh run
by one person yes and not an official institute
 Yes 
No but uh really a an ideal istitute which caters to
needs of very serene uh devoted scholars of English
Shall we say something like mini Shantiniketan
Yeah mini Shantiniketan but you know
Dr Cyrian does not want to be name Shantiniketan to be
given
Uhn
Because he says that uh the the terms that that there are
no one word university and the campus of Shantiniketan
 as far as the one word 
Ah ha
So that's the reason why he perhaps doesn't
like the name of Shantiniketan to be given 
But that's that's another matter
No no see
Anyway we we we always like to associate you know our own
perception of Shantiniketan our own uh you know
memory of Shantiniketan with what we saw at uh 
 one word 
True the campus is simply beautiful 
 Beautiful 
True 
Uh we had trip to Ooty some shall we say about ten
days ten fifteen days back
Almost fifteen days back
Fifteen days back
Now uhm there is a certain problems for arranging this but
after having arranged it and after having visited Ooty what do you think
about your our visit ?
Was it uh hurrying trip to Ooty or do you think that well it
was very succesful trip to Ooty ?
Oh I think it went off very well 
Uh the weather was fine extremely good that day
 Fine 
And it was cloudy but it didn't rain
Yeah
And it uh I think we very much enjoyed the scenery
Yeah 
There was sunshine for sometime at one word 
Ah and uh uh we were able to go round and see the
important stops
Uh yes
And important spots
Yes 
Incidently you know later on from the photograph I discovered
that we have missed out on two very important point
Oh really oh oh yeah what are they ?
 Yeah 
You see we they didn't take us around the childrens park
Oh I see
It seems Ooty has uh many nice childrens
park you know so 
 One or two words 
And the other one
We missed out on that 
And there is uh one telescope house it seems
Oh I see 
So we weren't taken to that spot
Yeah I think 
These two spots were missed out
Missed out on those two 
But don't you think that we visited a very wonderful and very
important one word the botanical garden
That was wonderful 
That was really marvellous marvellous 
 Marvellous 
Breath takingly beautiful I should say 
And uh I mean we didn't feel like coming out of it even
we spent an hour an quarter perhaps
Oh yes 
That was beautiful garden uh
That lake also that lake Ooty lake 
 Lake 
Ooty lake also 
But this was much better
Yeah yeah 
But I didn't like the lake as much I like uhm 
botanical garden especially the way it was maintained along 
and uh
 Yeah 
In fact uh 
Yes the bowers and uh that it did better than uh
Sky growing trees 
Better than the Brindavan garden I should say 
 Yeah yeah and uh Brindavan garden
And nurseries
Yes hardly thing anything in Brindavan garden that brings to
my mind 
Yeah that's right 
Uh except for those you know side one word 
 It's all giddish talking of life and you know that
 mu musical fountain 
Yeah 
But for that there is hardly anything in the 
Brindavan garden you know and you know sprawling that way
 Brindavan 
Yeah
But you know the variety of variety of flowers 
 Brindavan garden doesn't offer you much 
No but this botanic garden at at Ooty is simply
marvellous
Marvellous 
Regarding variety of colours of and and 
kind of flowers kind of trees
 And and 
 I'm glad we were able to make it that day
Yeah yeah and fortunately the weather co-operated with us
Yeah 
That wasn't it wasn't much crowded either 
Because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it 
 ah ha much
 Ah ha 
It all went up very well 
And uh later on we came to know that the chief minister of
Tamil Nadu uh visited uh at same day I see and
perhaps the things were well say in order then 
Uh these streets were clean and uh there were boards and
banners welcoming the chief minister of Tamil Nadu
 I see 
I see
Dr Jaylalitha uh 
Yes
And perhaps it was an advantage because uh I don't
know whether we were prevented from entering one word 
area 
 One word 
I think good shape 
Yes they think they will have a good shape 
 One or two words 
Yeah 
No but you know uh normally I think yeah 
they must be maintaining it very well
 Yeah 
 That's right
I think that's it uh 
Either way we had we had a very nice time there 
in the park
 Indeed 
Indeed 
Yeah indeed 
And uh we also return in time big thing
Yeah 
Uh well we left this place around seven yeah
 and we were back home by seven
 Yeah 
Yeah and 
You remember that uh it started raining when we were nearly
 outskirt of Mysore 
Mysore yes 
Yes and uh well uh we really succeeded in 
organising and enjoying our our Sunday in ooty dated to
 Ah that Ooty 
Dated to the 
Yes of course
