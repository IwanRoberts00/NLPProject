Uh  one of the reasons why we liked them was
that  and the other thing
was that they were very nice  use them as a
presents to our

Don't you think so  ?

It was quite uplifting  uh to be there
""
yes 
""
Uh the warm hospitality 
""
And uh 
was real good 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Wasn't it a very memorable and treasurable experience ?
""
""
Yes of course
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uh especially when you are from  we were made to sit uh
 yeah in the in the
""
tea in the  uh talked to us about
several things 
""
""
And uh 
""
""
Now  very interesting
 uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well everytime we even see C D N  everytime we talk to him
 we feel
inspired and 
""
""
""
""
""
As compared to 
""
Then he also uhm 
 the new periodical started and then the recent issue of
""
""
Uh number one is 
 I mean which has special number on

And I felt terribly inspired 
that even at that age after retirement  one can do lots
of good things
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So to me it was extremely uplifting and educative 
yes 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh another thing
""
""
Yeah, so please continue 
""
""
""
 uh on
their own 
""
Maybe  or
 because
he has a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Certainly 
""
""
""
""
""
He has a very good library in fact
""
And at the same time  uh there is a good place to
sit also
""
""
Yes
""
""
Especially in the library hall
""
""
Library hall the sitting arrangement
""
""
The round table
""
""
The sitting arrangement 
""

""
""
""
""
Right yes
""
""
Uh  man and for his
family

You see and besides 
here in the subject
""
Uhm  I very much remember you know the warm hospitality and
affection that they

Oh yes  uhm yeah
""
""
""
""
""
Everyone who stays with them has very fond memories of their
stay and uh  happy moments of talk and discussions
""
""
""
""
""
I think there is also his assistant by his uh  son and his
sister-in-law
""
""
Yeah one of his
""
""
And few others
""
""
Daughters-in-law
""
""
Yeah daughter-in-law sorry
""
""
And uh  some of his uh grand children
""
""
Yeah some of the grand children also  yes
""
""
So  uhm
""
Yes it it was memorable uhn experience through
""
""
Uh so 
uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
Another advantage is  Manas
Gangotri 
""
""
Uhm the university campus
""
""
University campus of Mysore 
""
So  really situated at an ideal place
""
""
So that was one of my
""
""
It is uh far away from the noise and bustle and  one word
""
""
And uh
""
""
Well  an ideal place for meditation and study
room
""
""
I very much wanted to visit the place
""
And  been able to
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uhm also that  Central Institute Of
Indian Languages 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Uhm I enjoyed my visit to that place too
""
""
Yes
""
""
Ah that way  some usual work
""
""
""
""
""
Certainly 
""
Another thing is that we were very fortunate in having  uh two
visits to Brindavan
""
""
Yeah especially when I  uh well I had stayed over here for
a month
""
""
Yeah and uh I think we could consider ourselves fortunate in
having these two visits
""
So that we  a few words
 and especially he gave us lot of information about that
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Uhm he gave us that  yeah
""
didn't you ?
""
""
""
""
""
Well yes  P G teacher on
the evening alone 
""
That was quite sometime ago
""
""
Yeah a couple of years ago I suppose 
""
""
Yeah 
collected
""
""
Yeah
""
""
We mentioned of that and uh 
""
""
Yeah 
""
When you mentioned it to Dr Cyrian he was also there I think
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And uh yeah this is one of the institute in India  uh run
by one person  and not an official institute
""
""
""
""
""
No  which caters to
needs of very  of English
""
""
Shall we say something like  Shantiniketan
""
""
""
Yeah mini  you know
Dr Cyrian does not want to be name  to be
given
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Because he says that uh  the the terms that that there are
no  Shantiniketan
""
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
So  perhaps doesn't
like the name of 
""
But  another matter
""
""
No no see
""
""
Anyway we we we always like to associate  you know our own
perception of  uh you know
memory of 
""
""
""
True the campus is simply 
""
""
""
""
""
True 
""
""
Uh we had trip to Ooty some  about ten
days ten fifteen days back
""
""
Almost fifteen days back
""
""
Fifteen days back
""
Now  uhm there is a certain problems for arranging this but
after having arranged it  and after having visited Ooty what do you think
about your our visit ?
""
Was it uh hurrying trip to Ooty or  do you think that well it
was very  succesful trip to Ooty ?
""
""
Oh I think it went off very well 
""
Uh the weather was  extremely good that day
""
""
""
""
""
And it was cloudy but it didn't rain
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And it uh  very much enjoyed the scenery
""
""
Yeah 
""
There was sunshine for sometime at 
""
""
Ah and uh  uh we were able to go round and see the
important stops
""
""
Uh yes
""
""
And important spots
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Incidently you know later on from the photograph I discovered
that we have missed out on  two very important point
""
""
Oh really  ?
""
""
""
""
""
You see we  they didn't take us around the childrens park
""
""
""
Oh I see
""
""
It seems Ooty has uh  childrens
park you know so 
""
""
""
""
""
And the other one
""
""
We missed out on that 
""
And there is uh  it seems
""
""
Oh I see 
""
""
So we weren't taken to that spot
""
""
Yeah I think 
""
""
These two spots were missed out
""
""
Missed out on those two 
""
But don't you think that we visited a very wonderful and very
important  the botanical garden
""
""
That was wonderful 
""
""
That was really 
""
""
""
""
""
Breath takingly beautiful I should say 
""
""
And uh  I mean we didn't feel like coming out of it even
we spent  an hour an quarter perhaps
""
""
Oh yes 
""
""
That was  beautiful garden uh
""
""
That lake also that 
""
""
""
""
""
Ooty lake also 
""
""
But this was much better
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
But 
botanical garden 
and uh
""
""
""
""
""
In fact uh 
""
""
Yes  that it did better than uh
""
""
""
Sky growing trees 
""
""
Better than the Brindavan 
""
""
 and uh Brindavan garden
""
""
And nurseries
""
""
Yes hardly thing anything in Brindavan garden that brings to
my mind 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uh except for those you know side 
""
 talking of life and you know that
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But for that 
Brindavan  and you know sprawling that way
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
But you know the variety of 
""
""
""
""
""
No  is simply
marvellous
""
""
Marvellous 
""
""
Regarding variety of colours 
kind of flowers kind of trees
""
""
""
""
""
 glad we were able to make it that day
""
""
Yeah yeah  and fortunately the weather co-operated with us
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
That wasn't it wasn't much crowded either 
""
""
Because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it 
 much
""
""
""
""
""
It all went up very well 
""
And uh later on we came to know that the  chief minister of
Tamil Nadu  and
perhaps the things were 
""
Uh these streets were clean and uh  there were boards and
banners  welcoming the chief minister of Tamil Nadu
""
""
""
""
""
I see
""
""
Dr 
""
""
Yes
""
""
And perhaps  I don't
know whether we were

""
Yes they think they will have a good shape

""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
No but you know uh 
they must be maintaining it very well
""
""
