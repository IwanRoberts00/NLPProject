Gold has always been considered a status symbol in India 
In addition people buy gold for security and this keeps
them interested in its prices 
The abolition of the Gold Control Act has resulted in a
fluctuation in gold prices 
We have this report from our correspondent Maya Sharma 
Gold in our country is a precious symbol of wealth and
security 
But the gold market itself does not glitter quite so much 
involving as it does inflated prices and large scale smuggling 
The government's decision to abolish the Gold Control Act
 was followed by an initial drop in the gold price from pre-budget
level 
But the cost of gold in India continues to be much higher than
in the international market 
The domestic demands of gold is estimated at two hundred and
fifty tonnes every year 
Less than two tonnes is produced by Indian mines annually and
about fifty tonnes is obtained from recycled gold 
The huge gap between supply and demand is filled to a large extent
by smuggled gold 
Those in the trade believe the current blanket ban on gold import
 should be lifted arguing that this should bring down the gold prices
 encourage export of jewellery and also curb smuggling 
The government stand is that gold is not an essential item to
justify expenditure of foreign exchange to import it 
Whatever the government's decision and regardless of
the price the desire for gold is only likely to increase
