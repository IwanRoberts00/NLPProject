Kate Chopin's The Awakening Sex-role
Liberation or Sexual Liberation 
Over the centuries women writers have written openly or implicitly
about the right of woman to passion 
In fact as Ellen Moers in her Literary Women 
says it was Ovid who with his with his Heroides 
first gave voice to the heroine in love 
According to Moers Ovid started a tradition which extended well
into the eighteenth century to become part of the infant novel in Britain 
and which was born anew in women's literature of the nineteenth
century 
Mary Wollstonecraft the strong-minded feminist comes to mind in
this respect 
For it is in her fiction reviews and letters that 
Wollstone Wollstonecraft is explicit about love
 The Wrongs of Women or Maria
 by Wollstonecraft is a celebration of an unhappy wife's 
 adulterous love from the point of view of a woman not only with a
mind but a body capable of passion 
Women writers also inherited from Rousseau the novel of adultery 
as seen from the woman's point of view 
As Moers put it I quote The adultery novel after
Rousseau became the woman writer's vehicle of attack on the economic
and social class realities that make a mockery of love as well as a
vehicle of demonstration that woman has a capacity to think feel and act
for herself unquote 
A whole host of writers and novelists spoke frankly about the
positive consequences of adultery 
George Elliot the Bronte sisters Gaskell Browning Collette and
Woolf to name only the most well known ones resolved to talk openly
about the forbidden subject and the right of a woman to participate
actively and consciously in the affairs of love clears her
throat 
The American literary scene had not witnessed the presence of a
traditon of novel writing by women who talk about their heroines from a
 woman's perspective 
The awakening of female novel writers to a sense of their own
identity begins only with the publication of Kate Chopin's 
 The Awakening at the turn of the last century 
One may even say that the American that the tradition
begins in the twentieth century 
Incidentaly The Awakening may be read as an
 adult adultery novel also 
 Chopin's novel sent waves of shock among the
pre-dominantly patriarchal set up of her time 
She became almost the first woman writer to create a woman in Edna
 Pontellier who not only awakens to her sexuality but makes bold to
confess it 
Linda Huf puts it succinctly I quote The novel 
suggested that the renegade heroine had not forgotten herself but had
in fact found herself had awakened to her full potential as a human
being and all because without consulting any one but her own
willful self she had taken un an unlawful
 fancy to a younger man unquote 
When the novel opens the twenty-eight year old Edna Pontellier is
holidaying at Grand Isle with her husband Leonce Pontellier and her
 two children Raoul and and Etienne 
I am sorry I don't know how to pronounce the French words so I am
 I am just talking in terms of the Anglicised pronunciation 
Pontellier a successful brokerage businessman is one of those
husbands who prides himself on his many possessions of which his wife is
the most precious and attractive 
Little wonder that he reacts typically when he reprimands Edna for
exposing herself at midday in such heat while bathing in the sea 
He is anxious that she should protect her complexion as
jealously if not more as her honour 
He scrutinizes her as he would a piece of personal property which
has suffered some damage 
During the six years of her married life Edna too has lived like
any other Southern wife in her beautiful house in New Orleans 
immersed immersed in her home and social circle 
She was married she sorry she has married Pontellier
for the same reason as any woman of her class would 
She chooses Leonce to become the devoted wife of a man who she
felt worshiped her 
She feels she would I quote Take her place with a
certain dignity in the world of reality closing the portals forever
behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams unquote 
The opening pages of the novel would give one the impression that
Edna is one of those usual Southern women who is contented looking after
her husband and children 
Yet through the flashback technique Chopin employs we
know that Edna had been a different person in her childhood girlhood 
and youth 
As a lonely and imaginative person she has given herself to secret
and intense infatuations 
First it is the dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer at
another time it is I quote the young gentleman who visits a lady on a
neighbourhood plantation unquote
Yet a third time it is I quote the figure of a great
tragedian that possessed her mind 
But marriage with the tragedian which would have been the highest
point of her happiness was not for her in this world 
However if he does not come in the form of a Leonce he
comes in the form of Robert Lebrun who awakens her to a sense of herself
as a person rather than as a piece of personal property 
But even before Robert begins to arouse Edna's dormant
passionate self it is the sea at Grand Isle which without her
realising it has begun to exert a powerful pull towards her 
The seductive voice of the sea never ceasing whispering 
clamouring murmuring invites Edna's soul to wander the
abyss of solitude 
The solitude of the Sea as Judith Fryer aptly says propels a
real awakening in Edna which I quote frees her from her place in
society unquote 
Fryer further maintains that in her illumination Edna is most
like Whitman's Awakened self and that
once we recognize the extent to which Edna's awakening is the
Whitmanian song of herself the radical nature of Chopin's 
intentions becomes clear 
Fryer considers The awakening as a song a
celebration of a woman who awakens to her identity as a person quote
 defined only in terms of her own experience not in relation
to any other person unquote 
Among the many images that Chopin uses to project either Edna's
 restrictive life or her freedom from this life the Sea is the
most dominant one 
It frames both Edna's awakening into life and her final
suicide 
The first six chapters of the book describe the seductive
quality of the Sea which stirs Edna's awakening 
So seductive is the pull of the sea that Edna experiences 
contradictory emotions of attraction and resistance to Robert's 
invitation to her to follow him to the shore or into the Sea 
I quote this is from the text A certain light was
beginning to dawn within her the light which's showing the way
 forbids it 
In short Mrs Pontellier was beginning to realize her position
in the universe as a human being and to recognise her relations as an
individual to the world within and about her unquote 
That Edna's awakening is clearly sexual is indicated by
 Chopin's description of the Sea and its effect on Edna 
The touch of the Sea is sensuous enfolding the body in its soft
 close embrace 
When Edna first arrives at Grand Isle she cannot swim the Sea
is dangerous to her 
Quote A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when
in the water unless there was a hand near by that might a hand
near that might reach out and reassure her unquote 
And of course it is Robert whose reassuring hand 
encourage encourages her to realize her power to
control her body and soul 
 Chopin's aim is in describing Edna's trial in
learning to swim is clear 
It becomes symbolic of Edna's moving away from a state of
dependence fear and repression to a state of independence 
boldness and an awakening of a sensuous self 
Edna wants to swim far wide where no woman has swum before 
As a consequence her will gradually turns resistant and
stubborn and eventually refuses to obey her husband's whims 
Chopin juxtaposes Edna's emerging self with her previous
dormant self to show how redundant her husband has become for her 
Her bathing in the sea with Robert and her going on a day-long boat
trip further shows Edna's boldness 
Yet neither while bathing in the sea nor during their day at
 Caminada do we see Edna and Robert in any kind of physical intimacy 
In fact the high point of Edna's sensual awakening
comes when Edna is alone at Madame uh Madame Antoine's 
 co sorry cottage while Robert is waiting
outside patiently for her to recover from her exhaustion after their boat
ride to Caminada 
More than Robert it is Adele one of the boarders at Grand
Isle who seems to play a significant role in Edna's sensual
awakening 
It is Adele who em emboldens 
Edna to exalt over her body without any shame 
Chopin devotes considerable space to describing the intimacy with
which the two women sit and talk on the beach at Grand Isle 
Yet as long as Edna is on Grand Isle her awakening remains at
the level of the sensual only 
There is no element of sex involved in her relationship with Robert
Before such a possibility arises Robert leaves for Mexico 
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences vis-a-vis
 Arobin comes much later
This is a lover that she consciously takes in the in the novel
it is shown that later in the novel 
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences vis-a-vis
 Arobin comes much later after she has emancipated herself 
from her marital familial and social ties after her return to New
Orleans 
Edna has begun to defy her husband's whims even while they
are at Grand Isle that is on the holiday 
But in New Orleans where they live it's it's their
home there she decides to free herself not only from her family duties
but also from her social commitments like her weekly reception day 
which she has had to observe to further her husband's business
 and his status in society 
She defiantly moves about alone at odd hours and in odd places 
As if this was not enough she turns to her old hobby of painting
 which at first she undertakes to kill the boredom of her life but
later with a seriousness which eventually helps her helps her to
handle her brush with a new sureness and ease helping her to work 
to grow in force and individuality
These are all textual quotes 
The next step in Edna's emancipation is her desire to
become economically independent which she becomes with the help of
her teacher Laidpore who sells some of her paintings for her 
This in addition to her small inheritance plus the money she
has won at the race track makes it possible for her to buy her pigeon
house
She lives in a separate house from her husband's now
Thus Edna awakens to her full identity as an individual 
quietly but firmly freeing herself from the stereotypical roles of a wife
and mother which society has imposed on her 
An important influence on Edna in arousing her later creativity 
which ultimately makes her a professional painter is Madame Reisz a
pianist Edna has met at Grand Isle 
Edna has been attracted by Reisz's professional
performance that is soiree for the vacationers S O I R E E please how
do we pronounce it ? 
Soiree 
Soiree okay 
But more than this Edna has been fascinated by Reisz's 
independence and her self-assertion and her tendency to trample on the
rights of others 
In New Orleans too Edna calls on Reisz quite often to hear her play
The atmosphere of her room invades Edna with repose 
 Reisz's music has the cons 
consistent effect of playing upon the responsive chords of her
inner being 
Although Reisz's rudeness and offensive manners try 
Edna's patience her divine art reaches Edna's spirit 
and sets it free 
Her observation that Reisz's observation in the text I
quote To be an artist includes much one must possess many
gifts which have not been acquired by one's own effort 
To succeed the artist must possess the courageous soul 
The soul that dares and defies unquote 
Challenges Edna to further free herself from the shackles of
social conventions 
Probably it is Reisz's indifference and unconcern for
social norms and conventions that emboldens Edna to confess what
she has not been able to do to anyone her passion for Robert 
It is then that Reisz says something that is at the centre of
 Chopin's examination in the novel 
I quote The bird that would soar above the level plain
of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings 
It is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings bruised 
exhausted fluttering back to earth unquote 
Obviousely through the bird imagery which like the imagery of
the sea flows throughout the novel 
Chopin is trying to portray the plight of women who either
remain imprisoned in cages of conventions or tear these conventions of
 and soar freely doing what they want to do or after having dared
to defy and soar find the freedom so daunting that like weaklings 
they fall on the land bruised and broken
