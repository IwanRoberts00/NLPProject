Kate  Sex-role
Liberation or Sexual Liberation 
""
Over the centuries women writers have written openly or implicitly
about the right of woman to passion 
""
In fact as Ellen Moers in her 
says 
first gave voice to the heroine in love 
""
According to Moers  Ovid started a tradition which extended well
into the eighteenth century to become part of the infant novel in Britain 
and which was born anew in  literature of the nineteenth
century 
""
Mary Wollstonecraft the strong-minded  feminist comes to mind in
this respect 
""
For it is in her fiction 
Wollstone  is explicit about love
""
""
 Maria
""
 not only with a
mind but a body capable of passion 
""
Women writers also inherited from Rousseau the novel of adultery 
as seen from the 
""
As Moers put it I quote  The adultery novel after
Rousseau became the woman  vehicle of attack on the economic
and social class realities  as well as a
vehicle of demonstration that woman has a capacity to think  feel and act
for herself 
""
A whole host of writers and novelists  spoke frankly about the
positive consequences of adultery 
""
George Elliot  the Bronte sisters Gaskell Browning Collette and
Woolf  resolved to talk openly
about the forbidden subject  and the right of a woman to participate
actively  clears her
throat 
""
The American literary scene had not witnessed the presence of a
traditon of novel writing by women  who talk about their heroines from a
""
""
The awakening of female novel writers to a sense of their own
identity 
""
""
One may even say that the American  tradition
begins in the twentieth century 
""
Incidentaly  may be read as an
""
""
 novel sent waves of shock among the
pre-dominantly patriarchal set up of her time 
""
She became almost the first woman writer to create a woman in Edna
 but makes bold to
confess it 
""
Linda Huf puts it succinctly I quote 
suggested  but had
in fact found herself  had awakened to her full potential as a human
being  but her own
willful self  an unlawful
""
""
When the novel opens the twenty-eight year old Edna Pontellier is
holidaying at Grand Isle  and her
""
""
I am sorry I don't know how to pronounce the French words so I am
""
""
Pontellier a successful brokerage businessman is one of those
husbands who prides himself  on his many possessions of which his wife is
the most precious and attractive 
""
Little wonder that he reacts typically when he reprimands Edna for
exposing herself at midday 
""
He is anxious that she should protect her complexion  as
jealously if not more 
""
He scrutinizes her as he would a piece of personal property which
has suffered some damage 
""
During the six years of her married life Edna too has lived like
any other Southern wife in her beautiful house in New Orleans 
immersed 
""
She was married  she has married Pontellier
for the same reason as any woman of her class would 
""
She chooses Leonce to become the devoted wife of a man  who she
felt 
""
She feels she would I quote  Take her place with a
certain dignity in the world of reality  closing the portals forever
behind her 
""
The opening pages of the novel would give one the impression that
Edna is one of those usual Southern women  who is contented looking after
her husband and children 
""
Yet  we
know that Edna had been a different person in her childhood 
and youth 
""
As a lonely and imaginative person she has given herself to secret
and intense 
""
First it is the dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer  at
another time it is I quote  the young gentleman who visits a lady on a
neighbourhood plantation  unquote
""
Yet a third time it is I quote  the figure of a great
tragedian 
""
But marriage with the tragedian which would have been the highest
point of her happiness 
""
However  he
comes in the form of Robert Lebrun  who awakens her to a sense of herself
as a person 
""
But even before Robert begins to arouse  dormant
passionate self  without her
realising it 
""
The seductive voice of the sea 
clamouring  soul to wander the
abyss of solitude 
""
The solitude of the Sea as Judith Fryer aptly says  propels a
real awakening in Edna which I quote  frees her from her place in
society 
""
Fryer further maintains that in her illumination  Edna is most
like  and that
once we recognize the extent to which  the
Whitmanian song of herself 
intentions becomes clear 
""
Fryer considers  a
celebration of a woman  quote
 not in relation
to any other person 
""
Among the many images that Chopin uses to project either  Edna's
 the Sea is the
most dominant one 
""
It frames both  awakening into life and her final
suicide 
""
The first six chapters of the book  describe the seductive
quality of the Sea 
""
So seductive is the pull of the sea that Edna experiences 
contradictory emotions of attraction and resistance to 
invitation to her 
""
I quote  A certain light was
beginning to dawn within her  showing the way
""
""
In short  Mrs Pontellier was beginning to realize her position
in the universe  and to recognise her relations as an
individual 
""
That  awakening is clearly sexual is indicated by
""
""
The touch of the Sea is sensuous  enfolding the body in its soft
""
""
When Edna first arrives at Grand Isle she cannot swim  the Sea
is dangerous to her 
""
Quote  A certain ungovernable dread hung about her when
in the water  a hand
near 
""
And of course 
encourage  to
control her body and soul 
""
 in
learning to swim is clear 
""
It becomes symbolic of  moving away from a state of
dependence 
boldness and an awakening of a sensuous self 
""
Edna wants to swim far wide where no woman has swum before 
""
As a consequence  her will gradually turns resistant and
stubborn and eventually refuses to obey her 
""
Chopin juxtaposes  emerging self with her previous
dormant self to show how 
""
Her bathing in the sea with Robert and her going on a day-long boat
trip 
""
Yet neither while  bathing in the sea nor during their day at
""
""
In fact  sensual awakening
comes when Edna is alone 
 while Robert is waiting
outside patiently for her to recover from her exhaustion after their boat
ride to 
""
More than Robert  one of the boarders at Grand
Isle who seems to play a significant role in  sensual
awakening 
""
It is Adele who 
Edna to exalt over her body 
""
Chopin devotes considerable space to describing the intimacy with
which the two women 
""
Yet as long as Edna is on Grand Isle  her awakening remains at
the level of the sensual only 
""
There is no element of sex involved in her relationship with Robert
""
""
Before such a possibility arises 
""
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences  vis-a-vis
 comes much later
""
This is a lover that she consciously takes in the  in the novel
it is shown 
""
The sexual freedom that Edna experiences  vis-a-vis
""
from her marital  after her return to New
Orleans 
""
Edna has begun to defy her  whims even while they
are at Grand Isle 
""
But in New Orleans  their
home there  she decides to free herself not only from her family duties
but also from her social commitments 
which she has had to observe to further  business
""
""
She defiantly moves about alone at odd hours and in odd places 
""
As if this was not enough she turns to her old hobby of painting
 but
later with a seriousness  helps her to
handle her brush 
to grow  in force and individuality
""
These are all textual quotes 
""
The next step in  is her desire to
become  which she becomes with the help of
her teacher 
""
This in addition to her small inheritance  plus the money she
has won at the race track  to buy her pigeon
house
""
She lives in a  now
""
""
Thus Edna awakens to her full identity 
quietly but firmly  freeing herself from the stereotypical roles of a wife
and mother 
""
An important influence on Edna in arousing her later creativity 
which ultimately makes her a professional painter  a
pianist 
""
Edna has been attracted by  professional
performance that is  S O I R E E please how
do we pronounce it ? 
""
""
Soiree 
""
""
Soiree 
""
But more than this Edna has been fascinated by 
independence and her self-assertion  and her tendency to trample on the
rights of others 
""
In New Orleans too Edna calls on Reisz quite often to hear her play
""
""
The atmosphere of her room invades Edna with repose 
""
""
consistent  of her
inner being 
""
Although 
Edna's 
and sets it free 
""
Her observation that  observation in the text I
quote  one must possess many
gifts 
""
To succeed 
""
The soul that dares and defies 
""
Challenges Edna to further free herself  from the shackles of
social conventions 
""
Probably it is  and unconcern for
social norms  what
she has not been able to do to anyone 
""
It is then that Reisz says something  that is at the centre of
""
""
I quote  The bird that would soar above the level plain
of tradition and prejudice 
""
It is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings 
exhausted 
""
Obviousely through the bird imagery  which like the imagery of
the sea flows throughout the novel 
""
Chopin is trying to portray the plight of women  who either
remain imprisoned in cages of conventions  or tear these conventions of
 or after having dared
to defy and soar 
they fall on the land bruised and broken
