How was the day today  ?
""
""
For me not very well 
""
""
What happened  ?
""
""
Today also I faced the same problem with tenth standard 
""
""
What was the problem  ?
""
""
These children though they are in tenth standard  they are
not very serious about their studies 
""
They keep on talking 
""
And there are some students who come from the 
influential families 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Yeah 
""
Actually because we can't say anything we can't do to this people
""
These children because they have their  business and all that
they are not more interested  and all that
""
""
""
""
""
They  we carry the same
business
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
So no need for study actually  heard one of the boy no
""
business 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So he is troubling the others 
""
""
Yeah  called but
""
""
""
""
""
The parent should be called and
""
""
Actually now we are going to call the parents you know after
the first unit test result  call them
""
""
""
""
""
""
Their parents come and sign the results no 
""
""
Ah  we have not still
given
""
But the students  for they have been troubling not only me
other teachers also lot of time
""
So  writing
 that they will never do such a thing and twice or thrice they
did the same thing 
""
But still we find their behaviour the same way
""
No change 
""
They themselves have given in 
""
""
They said that okay  we'll
 be serious about our studies
""
""
But the same thing we find  still they are troubling
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
When I punish the student their parents come and ask me  why
you punished the student 
""
They don't want punishment to be given to their children  and
they don't
""
""
""
""
""
 means like
making them  uh improvements in their writings and
""
""
Yeah actually when the child is  doing something wrong
 then also you should not punish and uh
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah even if they get zero we have to grant them anyhow 
marks
""
""
Yeah actually no they
""
""
They won't study 
""
""
Because of the parents attitude no we find even the 
childrens  behave the same way
""
The students when we try to
""
""
Yeah they take it lightly
""
""
Say something
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  the
meaning of benefit I think 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah actually now a days
""
""
Keep on just uh doing that whatever they want in their 
""
""
Yeah actually now a days we find mostly earlier the parents
were not like this 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But make the student
""
""
Even I find so many 
""
""
But now a days the parents have just become the opposite
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Now they say don't beat the children even if they are doing
something wrong 
""
""
Even now the now 
that my child is sick everytime  and he doesn't eat
properly 
 make
him uh  never
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah actually now a days especially we find earlier it was
different
""
During our time  come and tell the
teacher
""
""
Yeah we know how we have studied
""
""
Yeah  but now today you find the situation
totally different
""
The parents they encourage the children
""
""
""
""
""
Encourage  looking at
what they are doing
""
But if they have been
""
""
""
""
""
In  only they are encouraging
""
""
""
""
""
Teacher beats the child  they will come to
fight 
""
They will come 
then  they have to
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  see we teacher have to
""
""
And every time 
""
""
And  the thing
""
""
That is the problem with me also 
""
""
Even I face the same problem but I try to tackle it you know
with uh 
""
Actually not in this earlier school no I had problems  like this
most of the students no they are just like hooligans and all that
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Become  dealt successfully with some of
the children
""
See if we love them 
""
""
 that is
yeah
""
""
No if we pamper them little
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But 
yeah  though others they will think
that the teacher is going out of the way means we have to give them  many
means whatever 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No actually at first no for these children no we should not
give punishment 
""
We should pamper them a lot
""
 understand
""
""
""
""
""
Ah now  now
""
""
Once they come closer to us no then only we understand
""
""
Now in the tenth standard they are grown up
""
They understand the meaning of punishment
""
""
Yes
""
""
They feel  punishment
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
They are not ashamed 
when we took  them in writing the next time they did the same
thing
""
So when madam came to the class she punished the whole class 
""
And then means  to make them that whatever they are doing they
were standing on the bench to make ashamed  we send eighth standard
students just go and have a look at them
""
And you know what was the remark of tenth standard  what's
""
""
Means that was their reaction 
""
So they 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah that was their reaction when this eighth standard
students they came in class there  they didn't
felt ashamed nothing like that
""
""
""
""
""
Though they are small 
""
Clever in the sense  uh not in studies at all but
""
""
Uh they  co-curricular activities and
all that
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah beating and everything  and abuses that
don't know what  they are saying sometimes
""
""
Actually  the thing you know the parents they
don't respect the teacher  respect
""
""
""
""
""
Class I can make  out what the parent might be
speaking 
""
""
 when
they speak about the teacher  in derogative manners
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
So the children learns the same thing
""
""
Same thing  shut
them and nothing
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah now a days the situation has just become  so
different that uh  we have to bear even whatever they say
""
""
I never beat a student 
I've 
third standard I can see  they are something different because
they are never means uh guided in a way  or how to
talk with a teacher atleast 
""
Whenever we are uh  without thinking
they say out the words  now
""
""
""
""
""
Without thinking  are the words
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah and whatever  written on the board they
take out the meanings of that but don't understand what is the question what
is the answer for that 
""
But take  means
how clever they are mean uh  they
are clever
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah actually 
they'll  the mistake teacher is doing
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
They pronounce 
""
""
 even that if that were
""
""
Always they will be uh 
one word 
""
""
I will uh give marks for the student if he takes out my
mistake  one
word 
""
""
 always they try
""
Suppose the teacher is writing the chalk is not proper 
it's  not writing
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
Yeah  and all they
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah they will start laughing and all that
""
""
Yeah even we feel  they will keep on
saying
""
""
They are very particular about these things 
""
When you ask them question the whole class
""
""
Never 
 those
only will give the answers everytime ahn  and even
during inspection and all they only are very active and particular
""
Their parents do come and meet me 
uh about others maximum I can find that 
""
These students never  never bothered
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah actually even I 
""
""
But their parents whenever I beat them  the parents came
and ask me 
""
And  the same parents said unnecessarily you beat my child
""
""
""
 first only they
warned me 
because as 
""
Because if you will beat even if they have done something 
wrong 
""
""
""
""
""
 we feel about them no something
""
""
No action will be taken against that you will be 
person to be blamed 
""
So 
""
""
""
sometimes
""
We have to take the blame on that 
""
I feel about that only
""
""
Not sometime most of the time 
""
""
""
""
But uh sometime for these students also we feel  yeah
 you don't beat
them
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
But I feel somewhere  if these are to be guided just now
 this is the way
""
""
See I had a show-down with  one of the
boy no tenth standard
""
I had a show-down
""
""
""
""
""
Now tenth is a
""
""
And then  because
 means equal to him
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
That way he argued with me  so I said I will not enter the
class  till he says sorry to me
""
I came back I didn't went to that class 
""
Then madam interfered  that boy was called and he said sorry
""
Even when he said sorry he was crying  I
made him understand see  not happy making you say sorry to me
""
 not the thing but you should means respect me as a
teacher
""
 not equal to you
""
You can't talk me just like you talk to your friends  or your
younger ones
""
You can't talk to a teacher like that way
""
So I made him understand 
that
""
But now a days I find him 
""
""
""
""
""
Don't speak that way but  atleast he should be
clever 
""
""
""
""
""
Somewhere
""
""
You know what the student they tell no  at home they don't
treat us like this 
""
If we shout at him no means  this very particular boy when I
shouted at him no  at home nobody shouts
at me 
""
""
So what
""
""
That means we have to behave just the way their parents
behave at home
""
""
Yeah  and uh parents should come
to know
""
""
""
""
""
But how can we behave that way
""
""
You would have called the parents  you would have called
the parents 
""
""
No 
 yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now a days I find him  he
scores he pays attention 
""
""
Yours is tenth so it is nice but uh we 
""
""
 yeah
""
""
We can't help out means whatever the way their behaviour 
 we have to deal with you have to make make them understand
and 
""
But in our class what happens being a third standard  we
""
""
""
""
""
""
 there has to be a communication
with the students and the teacher  with my
students 
""
""
Yeah because
""
""
I cannot have a proper communication with them
""
""
That is true 
""
""
 why no we can't understand
""
Neither they understand me and I also can't understand them
""
""
That happens with every 
""
""
 the thing and if once we
have this no full  two way communication
""
