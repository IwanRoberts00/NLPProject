<I>
How was the day today ?
For me not very well it's been like usual 
What happened ?
Today also I faced the same problem with tenth standard 
What was the problem ?
These children though they are in tenth standard they are
not very serious about their studies 
They keep on talking mostly the back benchers 
And there are some students who come from the aff 
influential families yeah they also trouble the others 
 Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Actually because we can't say anything we can't do to this people
These children because they have their business and all that
they are not more interested in studies and all that
 Yeah 
They might be thinking that we carry the same
business
 Keep on troubling yeah 
Yeah 
So no need for study actually I've heard one of the boy no
 actually he said that sir I have my father's 
business I just come here see to pass my time 
 See 
Yes one word 
So he is troubling the others 
Yeah their parents should be called but
 That's why the others 
The parent should be called and
Actually now we are going to call the parents you know after
the first unit test result uhm so we'll call them
 we'll talk with them 
 Uhm 
Their parents come and sign the results no 
Ah actually the parents no we have not still
given
But the students for they have been troubling not only me
other teachers also lot of time
So from them we had taken in written writing
 that they will never do such a thing and twice or thrice they
did the same thing 
But still we find their behaviour the same way
No change 
They themselves have given in written writing 
 when we reported to sir and madam 
They said that okay we are giving in writing that we'll
 not trouble any teacher we'll be serious about our studies
 
But the same thing we find still they are troubling
 Or they would be given by 
 Even I face the same problem 
When I punish the student their parents come and ask me why
you punished the student 
They don't want punishment to be given to their children and
they don't
 They'll take the side of their children 
 And they want uh only benefit means like
making them uh improvements in their writings and
Yeah actually when the child is doing something wrong
 then also you should not punish and uh
 Yeah they should study 
Yeah even if they get zero we have to grant them anyhow 
marks
Yeah actually no they
They won't study 
Because of the parents attitude no we find even the 
childrens children behave the same way
The students when we try to
Yeah they take it lightly
Say something
Yeah it is 
 It is of their benefit they don't listen 
Yeah benefit they don't understand the
meaning of benefit I think 
 Yeah 
Yeah actually now a days
Keep on just uh doing that whatever they want in their 
Yeah actually now a days we find mostly earlier the parents
were not like this 
Yeah first they used to ask 
 They used to say beat us 
Yeah 
But make the student
Even I find so many sa 
But now a days the parents have just become the opposite
Yeah 
Now they say don't beat the children even if they are doing
something wrong don't do anything 
Even now the now a days parents emphasise no 
that my child is sick everytime yeah and he doesn't eat
properly he keeps on playing if uh they will say this all 
 but they won't say that ki ma make
him uh beat him or make him do whatever you want never
 But they they have to pass 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah actually now a days especially we find earlier it was
different
During our time our parents they used to come and tell the
teacher
Yeah we know how we have studied
Yeah yeah but now today you find the situation
totally different
The parents they encourage the children
 Yeah 
Encourage means they won't be uh looking at
what they are doing
But if they have been
 Not to be beaten 
In these things only they are encouraging
 If this happens no 
Teacher beats the child yeah they will come to
fight 
They will come till to the Principal 
then they have to
 Yeah 
Yeah see we teacher have to
And every time they've to scold us 
And that's the thing
That is the problem with me also 
Even I face the same problem but I try to tackle it you know
with uh I've got some problems whenever I have 
Actually not in this earlier school no I had problems like this
most of the students no they are just like hooligans and all that
Yeah 
Become since I've dealt successfully with some of
the children
See if we love them if we pamper a little 
 You had to do that na that is
yeah
No if we pamper them little
Yeah 
But sometimes no we have to go out of our way 
yeah for these childrens especially though others they will think
that the teacher is going out of the way means we have to give them many
means whatever at first they have not done home work 
 Yeah 
 Some punishment is required 
No actually at first no for these children no we should not
give punishment 
We should pamper them a lot
 Then try to make them understand
 Yeah because they understand 
Ah now now
Once they come closer to us no then only we understand
Now in the tenth standard they are grown up
They understand the meaning of punishment
Yes
They feel some shameful about that punishment
 No actually I'll tell you 
Yeah
They are not ashamed I'll tell you because once 
when we took from them in writing the next time they did the same
thing
So when madam came to the class she punished the whole class 
And then means to make them that whatever they are doing they
were standing on the bench to make ashamed we send eighth standard
students just go and have a look at them
And you know what was the remark of tenth standard what's
 to us let them come and see 
Means that was their reaction 
So they were not bothered 
 Two words 
Yeah that was their reaction when this eighth standard
students they came in class there no reaction they didn't
felt ashamed nothing like that
 In even my class 
Though they are small they are very clever 
Clever in the sense uh not in studies at all but
Uh they are doing co-curricular activities and
all that
 One word 
Yeah beating and everything and using and abuses that
don't know what they are saying sometimes
Actually what's the thing you know the parents they
don't respect the teacher so the students also don't respect
 Yeah in our cla 
Class I can make out what the parent might be
speaking 
 Because at time you see even the parents when
they speak about the teacher in derogative manners
Yeah yeah 
So the children learns the same thing
Same thing and so we have to just shut
them and nothing
 That's the state 
Yeah now a days the situation has just become so
different that uh we have to bear even whatever they say
I never beat a student never in my whole life 
I've never beat a single student but now when I came to 
third standard I can see that uh they are something different because
they are never means uh guided in a way to how to behave or how to
talk with a teacher atleast 
Whenever we are uh saying something they without thinking
they say out the words now
 Even I never beat 
Without thinking what are the words
 Yeah 
Yeah and whatever I've written on the board they
take out the meanings of that but don't understand what is the question what
is the answer for that never 
But take out other meanings from that means
how clever they are mean uh means unwanted things they
are clever
 Other one word 
 Yes 
Yeah actually that's the thing suppose 
they'll always see what's the mistake teacher is doing
Yeah 
They pronounce one word 
 Not even that if that were
Always they will be uh what's the teacher 
one word 
I will uh give marks for the student if he takes out my
mistake but they don't even take that much of pains to one
word 
 That is they try no always they try
Suppose the teacher is writing the chalk is not proper 
it's not writing
 Laughs 
Yeah
Yeah it's making sound and all they
 It's a funny idea 
Yeah they will start laughing and all that
Yeah even we feel one word they will keep on
saying
They are very particular about these things laughs 
When you ask them question the whole class
Never even I can make out only few students 
 yeah those coming in five firstly I think those
only will give the answers everytime ahn yeah and even
during inspection and all they only are very active and particular
Their parents do come and meet me but yeah 
uh about others maximum I can find that I can give the examples 
These students never never bothered
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah actually even I two words 
But their parents whenever I beat them the parents came
and ask me purposely why 
And the same parents said unnecessarily you beat my child
 Even for me the other teachers first only they
warned me yeah that don't beat these these these child 
because as I'm new no they told me 
Because if you will beat even if they have done something 
wrong 
 Yeah 
 But we feel about them no something
No action will be taken against that you will be the 
person to be blamed 
So the parents will come and they will blame you only 
 Blames means uh we have to take the blame 
sometimes
We have to take the blame on that 
I feel about that only
Not sometime most of the time we have to take 
 Most of the time means yes that is true 
But uh sometime for these students also we feel yeah
 even madam has told me that some students are such you don't beat
them
 Yeah 
Yeah
But I feel somewhere if these are to be guided just now
 this is the way
See I had a show-down with yeah one of the
boy no tenth standard
I had a show-down
 Yeah 
Now tenth is a
And then I told them okay because
 he argued with me like anything as I was means equal to him
 One word 
 One word 
Ah
That way he argued with me so I said I will not enter the
class till he says sorry to me
I came back I didn't went to that class for two three days 
Then madam interfered that boy was called and he said sorry
Even when he said sorry he was crying then I told him I
made him understand see I'm not happy making you say sorry to me
 That's not the thing but you should means respect me as a
teacher
 I'm elder to you I'm not equal to you
You can't talk me just like you talk to your friends or your
younger ones
You can't talk to a teacher like that way
So I made him understand nahi 
that
But now a days I find him but it has one word 
 Nahi 
Don't speak that way but atleast he should be
clever 
 No actually what the thing you know 
Somewhere
You know what the student they tell no at home they don't
treat us like this 
If we shout at him no means this very particular boy when I
shouted at him no to other teacher he said at home nobody shouts
at me 
So what
That means we have to behave just the way their parents
behave at home
Yeah parents behave and uh parents should come
to know
 They expect the same behaviour 
But how can we behave that way
You would have called the parents you would have called
the parents 
No actually he himself said sorry 
 one word actually I find yes
 Because this is not proper 
 But we should actually 
Now a days I find him little bit one word he
scores he pays attention 
Yours is tenth so it is nice but uh we said that 
 So it is yeah
We can't help out means whatever the way their behaviour 
 yeah we have to deal with you have to make make them understand
and one word 
But in our class what happens being a third standard we
 one word should guide 
 Yeah 
 No actually no there has to be a communication
with the students and the teacher I I find that I have a gap with my
students 
Yeah because
I cannot have a proper communication with them
That is true 
 That's why no we can't understand
Neither they understand me and I also can't understand them
That happens with every teacher and yeah 
 Yeah that's the thing and if once we
have this no full communication with one other two way communication
 then only we can say that
