These children because they have their  business and all that

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
marks
""
""
""
""
""
They won't study 
""
""
Because of the parents attitude no we find even the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that my child is sick everytime  and he doesn't eat
properly 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah actually now a days especially we find earlier it was
""
""
During our time  come and tell the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fight 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Even I face the same problem but I try to tackle it you know
with uh 
""
Actually not in this earlier school no I had problems  like this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See if we love them 
""
""
 that is
""
""
""
No if we pamper them little
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No actually at first no for these children no we should not
""
""
We should pamper them a lot
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They are not ashamed 
""
thing
""
So when madam came to the class she punished the whole class 
""
""
were standing on the bench to make ashamed  we send eighth standard
""
""
And you know what was the remark of tenth standard  what's
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
students they came in class there  they didn't
""
""
""
""
""
""
Though they are small 
""
Clever in the sense  uh not in studies at all but
""
""
""
all that
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah beating and everything  and abuses that
""
""
""
""
don't respect the teacher  respect
""
""
""
""
""
""
speaking 
""
""
""
they speak about the teacher  in derogative manners
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
them and nothing
""
""
""
""
""
""
different that uh  we have to bear even whatever they say
""
""
""
""
""
they are never means uh guided in a way  or how to
""
""
Whenever we are uh  without thinking
""
""
""
""
""
""
Without thinking  are the words
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah and whatever  written on the board they
""
is the answer for that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah actually 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
mistake  one
word 
""
""
 always they try
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  and all they
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah they will start laughing and all that
""
""
""
""
""
""
They are very particular about these things 
""
""
""
""
Never 
 those
""
during inspection and all they only are very active and particular
""
""
uh about others maximum I can find that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and ask me 
""
""
""
""
""
 first only they
warned me 
""
""
Because if you will beat even if they have done something 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sometimes
""
We have to take the blame on that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
See I had a show-down with  one of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then madam interfered  that boy was called and he said sorry
""
""
made him understand see  not happy making you say sorry to me
""
""
teacher
""
""
""
""
""
""
You can't talk to a teacher like that way
""
So I made him understand 
""
""
But now a days I find him 
""
""
""
""
""
Don't speak that way but  atleast he should be
""
""
""
""
""
""
Somewhere
""
""
You know what the student they tell no  at home they don't
treat us like this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That means we have to behave just the way their parents
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But how can we behave that way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now a days I find him  he
scores he pays attention 
""
""
Yours is tenth so it is nice but uh we 
""
""
""
""
""
We can't help out means whatever the way their behaviour 
""
and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
