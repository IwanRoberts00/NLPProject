 First read the Abstract of the paper 
titled development of grammar in animal communication systems
 and in pidgins 
This paper comprises three sections Section one and
two deal with animal communication systems and 
Section three with human communication systems 
To study Animal communication system the Washoe
project in which a chimpanzee learnt American sign language and
the Lana Project in which a chimpanzee learns rudimentary
language-type systems are described 
The studies prove conclusively that chimpanzee separated
from humans by a mere genetic whisker are unable to grasp syntax 
the combination of a finite number of signs in an infinite number of new
way 
It separates language from other forms of communication 
such as Vocalisation facial expression gestures which
are all paralinguistics features 
Specifically till date we have no evidence of any animal 
spontaneously evolving true language without anybody to teach it 
The only animal who does this is man 
The focus in section three is on human communication systems
 specifically how communication takes place among speakers of pidgin
languages 
Theories which have been propounded to explain the origins of
language are explored as The single mutation theory 
the innate propensity theory the social pressure or need theory and
the contact theory as they have specific relevance to pidgins
A dozen examples of Vendor's English 
domestic's English and Shipee English
 subsumed under the conventional title of Butler
English an English pidgin spoken in India for over a century
 recorded from nineteen eighty-two to nineteen ninety-two are listed
They reveal modest language competence in pidgin speakers 
at the levels of morphology syntax and lexico-semantics 
Extracts from Tay Boi a French pidgin spoken in Vietnam are
listed 
Similarities between it and Butler English 
and English pidgin can be deduced 
This gives credibility to the claim that all pidgins are
similar should refer to The innate propensity theory 
 as they are forged in condition where the premium is on
transmitting facts withour frills it should refer to The
social pressure or need theory and The contact
theory 
Similarities between the chimpanzee's 
rudimentary language type system and The pidgin 
speaker's modest language competence have been noted
and cross referenced 
A common thread runs through the three sections of this paper 
that language serves one basic function that of communication 
At no point is it suggested that the three sections represent
 a gradual progression 
No doubt animal communication systems and human communication
systems are different for example Instinctive and
interactive and Innate and interactive 
 but they are also similar for example limited structures and
innovative structures 
Finally the basis for any comparison of cross-species communication
 is in the final analysis compassion for all forms of life
 Deve recording broken The paper comprises three
sections Section one and two deal with animal
communication systems and Section three with
human communication system 
I will concentrate only on the animal communication system 
First of all what is communication? 
 Hockett in nineteen sixty defined
communication as An act by which one individual triggers
the behaviour of another 
 S. A. Altmann in nineteen sixty-seven stated
that communication occurs when the behaviour of one individual 
affects the behaviour of the other 
Although this definition is widely accepted by researchers 
dealing with animal communication it suffers from generality 
Communicative features may be linguistic or non-linguistic 
verbal or non-verbal vocal or non-vocal 
Verbal and non-verbal communication do not represent
discontiguous processes 
Both are dependent upon similar complex coding and decoding
cognitive processes and to the extent that these processes are
comparable between species the abilities of different species to exchange
information will also be similar 
Cognitive styles of perceiving and ordering the world are a
combined function of an organism's innate neurological equipment
 and his sensory-motor interactions minus emotion which is
environmental surroundings 
Speech is a communication system superimposed on a biological
process that of breathing 
Communication systems superimposed on two other essential
biological processes are that of eating and that of sex 
Now here are some examples of how birds fish and mammals
communicate 
Most of the communicative features are non-linguistic 
non-verbal and non-vocal 
I am going to specially talk about versatile behaviour 
and intentional communication 
Biologists observing animals have noted that they are capable
of versatile behaviour and intentional communication which lead us
to the conclusion that animals can think 
Here are some striking examples of versatile behaviour from
 The Hindu nineteen ninety-eight 
The Galapagos finch uses specially shaped twigs to prise
out grub from a hole 
The green-backed heron breaks twigs into small pieces and
floats them on the water 
Minnows that are attracted to the twigs end up as lunch 
When the beaver's dam is damaged and it is forced to
make emergency repairs it discards familiar techniques if they prove
futile and tries novel strategies 
 Termite's nests despite hot temperatures outside
 maintain a certain level of coolness within 
When two female gobi fish meet in a corner of a coral reef one
of them changes into a male so that the two can mate 
 What's more the male fish can reverse back to a female
 although not so easily 
The fish opts for a sex change as a long search for a mate 
puts them at the mercy of a predators 
 They are not good swimmers says Phillip Munday
of the James Cook University of North Queensland in Townsville 
Japanese researchers support these findings 
Finally wading birds migrate to New Zealand after breeding
in Alaska a non-stop trip of eleven thousand kilometres 
Before they migrate they binge till upto fifty-five percent of
their weight is fat 
To compensate for the added weight they destroy a part of
their internal organ like the kidney and the liver by up to
twenty-five percent 
When they land they rebuild them again 
Now Information Technology is perhaps the
greatest revolution of this century 
There is the Internet which links people all over the world
But would you believe that insects too have a similar communication
system ? 
Just as we communicate physically and electronically insects
communicate through sounds light movement and chemicals 
I am going to give you some striking examples of intentional
communication from The Hindu in nineteen
ninety-eight 
In the insects communication system the chemical used as a
communicators are called pheromones from Greek
 pherien to carry and hormaein 
to excite 
The quantity of pheromones used their effective distance and
specificity all play an important part 
For example a female sex phor 
 pheromone can attract the
male from a distance of two miles or more 
Male moths fly towards the smell zone which increases as the
male approaches the female 
Ants use these pheromones to communicate their message 
As one or two ants identify the source of food they leave an
invisible line of pheromones called trail marking
 pheromones on the ground as they move which
can be sensed by ants following 
The ant is so meticulous that it chooses the highly specific
 pheromone which does not evoke responses from ants
of other species 
Thus each possesses its own language and higway code 
Ants produce a pheromone after their death the odour of which
immediately provokes worker ant to remove the corpse from the nest
Some pheromones are used to warn friends of
intending danger 
If you disturb an insect in an anthill or a beehive the insect
disturbed sents off alarm phermones which spread panic through
the nest 
Dolphins sometimes referred to as monkeys of the sea they too
communicate 
They use unique signature whistles to keep in touch with others
 that are out of sight says British zoologists
And this is from The Hindu nineteen
ninety-seven 
And do fish talk? 
In a way they do 
They tell each other how they feel by the way they wiggle and
blow bubbles 
Fish which live at the very bottom of the ocean have a special
way of communicating they glow with a bright light 
Some light up to startle their prey others just to say hello to
each other The Hindu nineteen ninety-seven 
Dr Cyndy Sims Parr of Michigan states that crows' long
distance caws of which there are fifteen or twenty have different
meaning determined by their form and rhythm 
Various vocalizations can mean stay out of my territory 
watch out someone's after your lunch or help me get this
predator out of here 
She says that a string ko-ko-ko-ko-ko-ko 
means neighbour you're tresspassing 
In addition there are the many soft sounds crows make when
talking with family members like gargles coos squawks squeals 
and plaintive oo-oo's for example 
squeal means teasing one another and oo-oo's 
 are cries of hunger from The Hindu 
nineteen ninety-seven 
And now I'll conclude with the dance of the honeybee 
For it is the dance of the honeybee that constitutes one of the
most elaborate systems of communication C Russell and W M S
Russell nineteen seventy-one 
The dance was first noticed by Pastor Ernst Spitz ner
 Spitzner in seventeen eighty-eight but it was left to
an Austrian zoologist Karl Von Frisch to interpret the language of the
honeybees 
For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize in nineteen
seventy-three 
When a Carniolan honeybee discovers a new source of honey 
within about ten metres of the hive she returns to the hive and
regurgitates drops of honey which are eagerly drunk by other bees 
Then she begins to dance round in a circle this is called 
the round dance 
During the round dance the bee runs in small circle 
clockwise and anti-clock-wise alternately 
The bees who watch her finds the new source of food 
The round dance therefore tells other bees to search the near
neighbourhood of the hive and the scent on the dancers body tells
them what flowers to look for 
But honeybees have been known to forage for food at distances
of thirteen kilometres equivalent of thousand miles for a human being
So when a honeybee finds food say between hundred metres 
and hun and hun and ten kilometres she returns to
the hive offers the honey she has found and performs a
different kind of number called a tail wagging dance 
In the case of the waggle dance the bee dances tracing a
 Figure of eight 
Like the round dance the waggle dance tells the bee that there
is food available and what flowers to look for 
But it also tells them exactly how far away the flowers are and
in exactly what direction 
The tempo of the dance conveys the distance to the food a
quick step tempo indicating a relatively nearby food source and a slow
foxtrot tempo a more distant one 
Even all this does not exhaust the language of the honeybee dances
They can also vary in liveliness and total duration 
They are livelier and longer the sweeter the food the
easier it is gathered the better the weather 
Minute details have been left out such as the waggle dance
making the same angle with the sun as the honeybee's flight-path
did a complicated piece of geometrical calculation 
But even from this brief description it can be inferred that
the system of communication evolved by the honeybees is marvellous indeed
Thank you
