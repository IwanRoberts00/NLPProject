titled  development of grammar in animal communication systems
""
""
This paper comprises three sections  Section one and
two deal with animal communication systems 
Section three with human communication systems 
""
To study  the Washoe
project  and
the Lana Project  rudimentary
language-type systems 
""
The studies prove conclusively  separated
from humans by a mere genetic whisker 
the combination of a finite number of signs  in an infinite number of new
way 
""
It separates language 
such as  which
are all paralinguistics features 
""
Specifically till date 
spontaneously evolving true language 
""
The only animal who does this is man 
""
The focus in section three  is on human communication systems
 among speakers of pidgin
languages 
""
Theories which have been propounded to explain the origins of
language 
the innate propensity theory  and
the contact theory  as they have specific relevance to pidgins
""
""
A dozen examples of 
domestic's  Shipee English
 Butler
English  an English pidgin spoken in India for over a century
 are listed
""
""
They reveal modest language competence 
at the levels of morphology 
""
Extracts from Tay Boi  are
listed 
""
Similarities between it 
and 
""
This gives credibility to the claim  that all pidgins are
similar 
 where the premium is on
transmitting facts  The
social pressure or need theory  The contact
theory 
""
Similarities between the 
rudimentary language type system 
speaker's  have been noted
and cross 
""
A common thread runs through the three sections of this paper 
that language serves one basic function 
""
At no point is it suggested  that the three sections represent
""
""
No doubt animal communication systems and human communication
systems are different  Instinctive and
interactive 
 and
innovative structures 
""
Finally the basis for any comparison of cross-species communication
 of life
""
""
 The paper comprises three
sections  deal with animal
communication systems  with
human communication system 
""
I will concentrate only on the animal communication system 
""
First of all 
""
 defined
communication as  triggers
the behaviour of another 
""
 stated
that communication occurs 
affects the behaviour of the other 
""
Although this definition is widely accepted by researchers 
dealing with animal communication 
""
Communicative features may be linguistic or non-linguistic 
verbal or non-verbal 
""
Verbal and non-verbal communication  do not represent
discontiguous processes 
""
Both are dependent upon similar complex coding  and decoding
cognitive processes  and to the extent that these processes are
comparable between species  the abilities of different species to exchange
information 
""
Cognitive styles of perceiving and ordering the world  are a
combined function of an  innate neurological equipment
 which is
environmental surroundings 
""
Speech is a communication system  superimposed on a biological
process 
""
Communication systems  superimposed on two other essential
biological processes 
""
Now here are some examples of how birds  fish and mammals
communicate 
""
Most of the communicative features are non-linguistic 
non-verbal and non-vocal 
""
I am going to specially 
and intentional communication 
""
Biologists observing animals have noted  that they are capable
of versatile behaviour  which lead us
to the conclusion 
""
Here are some striking examples of versatile behaviour  from
""
""
The Galapagos finch  to prise
out grub from a hole 
""
The green-backed heron  and
floats them on the water 
""
Minnows that are attracted to the twigs 
""
When the  and it is forced to
make emergency repairs  if they prove
futile 
""
 outside
""
""
When two female gobi fish meet in a corner of a coral reef  one
of them changes into a male so that the two can mate 
""
 the male fish can reverse back to a female
""
""
The fish opts for a sex change 
puts them at the mercy of a predators 
""
 says Phillip Munday
of the James Cook University of North Queensland 
""
Japanese researchers support these findings 
""
Finally  after breeding
in Alaska 
""
Before they migrate  they binge till upto fifty-five percent of
their weight is fat 
""
To compensate for the added weight  they destroy a part of
their internal organ  by up to
twenty-five percent 
""
When they land 
""
Now  is perhaps the
greatest revolution of this century 
""
There is the Internet  which links people all over the world
""
""
But would you believe that insects too have a similar communication
system ? 
""
Just as we communicate physically and electronically  insects
communicate through sounds 
""
I am going to give you some striking examples of intentional
communication  in nineteen
ninety-eight 
""
In the insects communication system  the chemical used as a
communicators are called  from Greek
""
to excite 
""
The quantity of pheromones used  their effective distance and
specificity 
""
For example 
 can attract the
male 
""
Male moths fly towards the smell zone  which increases as the
male approaches the female 
""
Ants use these pheromones to communicate their message 
""
As one or two ants identify the source of food  they leave an
invisible line of  called trail marking
 which
can be sensed by ants following 
""
The ant is so meticulous  that it chooses the highly specific
 which does not evoke responses from ants
of other species 
""
Thus each possesses its own language 
""
Ants produce a pheromone after their death  the odour of which
immediately provokes worker ant  from the nest
""
""
Some  are used to warn friends of
intending danger 
""
If you disturb an insect in an anthill or a beehive  the insect
disturbed  through
the nest 
""
Dolphins sometimes referred to as monkeys of the sea  they too
communicate 
""
They use unique signature whistles  to keep in touch with others
 says British zoologists
""
And this is from  nineteen
ninety-seven 
""
And do fish talk? 
""
In a way they do 
""
They tell each other how they feel  by the way they wiggle and
blow bubbles 
""
Fish which live at the very bottom of the ocean  have a special
way of communicating 
""
Some light up to startle their prey  others just to say hello to
each other 
""
Dr Cyndy Sims Parr of Michigan states  long
distance caws  have different
meaning determined by their form and rhythm 
""
Various vocalizations can mean 
watch out  or help me get this
predator out of here 
""
She says 
means neighbour 
""
In addition there are the many soft sounds crows make  when
talking with family members like gargles 
and plaintive 
squeal means teasing one another 
""
nineteen ninety-seven 
""
And now 
""
For it is the dance of the honeybee that constitutes  one of the
most elaborate systems  C Russell and W M S
Russell nineteen seventy-one 
""
The dance was first noticed by Pastor Ernst  ner
 but it was left to
an Austrian zoologist Karl Von Frisch  to interpret the language of the
honeybees 
""
For this he was awarded the Nobel Prize  in nineteen
seventy-three 
""
When a Carniolan honeybee discovers a new source of honey 
within about ten metres of the hive  and
regurgitates drops of honey 
""
Then she begins to dance round in a circle 
the round dance 
""
During the round dance 
clockwise and anti-clock-wise alternately 
""
The bees who watch her 
""
The round dance therefore tells other bees  to search the near
neighbourhood of the hive  tells
them what flowers to look for 
""
But honeybees have been known to forage for food  at distances
of thirteen kilometres  equivalent of thousand miles for a human being
""
""
So when a honeybee finds food say between hundred metres 
and hun and hun  she returns to
the hive  a
different 
""
In the case of the waggle dance  tracing a
""
""
Like the round dance  the waggle dance tells the bee that there
is food available 
""
But it also tells them exactly how far away the flowers are  and
in exactly what direction 
""
The tempo of the dance conveys the distance to the food  a
quick step tempo indicating a relatively nearby food source  and a slow
foxtrot tempo 
""
Even all this does not exhaust the language of the honeybee dances
""
""
They can also vary in liveliness 
""
They are livelier and longer  the
easier it is gathered 
""
Minute details have been left out  such as the waggle dance
making the same angle with the sun  flight-path
did 
""
But even from this brief description it can be inferred  that
the system of communication evolved by the honeybees  is marvellous indeed
