This man was lucky 
""
""
agonizing weeks 
""
Agonizing both for his family 
""
""
""
""
Now terrorism itself is a form of blackmail 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because  not his
""
""
Now George  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
groups that take them 
""
 who
""
""
But we have the same problem  in
""
""
And in other parts of the world  in Lebanon and uh
""
""
So that this is becoming a universal phenomenon  and one which
""
""
""
""
have to decide 
""
""
Miss Akhtar with a special  background of Kashmir
connection 
""
""
""
""
I would like to  the problem in
""
""
""
""
""
They had their headquarters 
""
""
""
""
""
""
But when the government didn't release  that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But 
""
""
""
It is controlled by the Jamait-e-Islami of Pakistan 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then they shifted to Muzaffarabad 
""
They are infiltrating into 
""
And mainly this  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes it is actively involved 
""
 say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ayub Khan said 
""
""
""
""
""
 in Afghanistan he
""
""
 sharnarthis
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
says that its workers are being kidnapped and  and tortured and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in tribal area 
""
""
George do you agree with this 
""
""
Well I 
""
""
""
""
""
""
The question is  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think  I am
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Is it true that the groups run into hundreds now 
""
""
More  hundred
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the question that the country has to face is whether in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
but it 
""
I think this is the central issue that needs to be faced 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But as I would say if one looks at the problem in Assam 
""
set of circumstances there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Kashmir or Andhra 
""
But to try and fasten a national approach to dealing with the
problem that could adopt 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
Dorayswamy for weeks 
""
""
as a national problem 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Mufti  Sayeed was perhaps
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 against any of the
""
was being waged 
""
""
""
""
""
young hostage is released Miss Sayeed  a good
""
""
""
 it has made it more difficult
""
question immediately  why aren't you
""
""
""
as a father 
""
And  does not the life of an ordinary average person count as
""
""
""
""
Perhaps the time has come  we
""
""
""
Whether it is a government of one complexion or another  call
""
deal with hostages 
""
Otherwise one is going to be blackmailed all along the line
""
""
""
What do you think Miss Akhtar Mansoor
""
""
""
between 
""
""
What happens 
""
""
""
""
Maybe two three four persons
""
A professor may be a doctor may be engineer or  or a high
""
""
""
otherwise we will assassinate  your persons
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What happens when you start releasing 
""
strong 
""
""
George if I may express my own view  life is more
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
release or not release 
""
""
""
""
""
How 
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is the question 
""
""
""
""
Take the case of Mr Doraswamy  some people have been released
 by the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh 
""
""
responsible  some hostages
""
""
""
And subsiquently  the General Manager of the H M T
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because this will  from one hostage to
""
""
""
And that would be unacceptable 
""
""
""
""
""
taken the line that they are not going to submit to any kidnapping 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in one
situation or another 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
other place  George
""
""
""
""
""
Frankly I I  any unanimity on any
""
""
Name me one problem on which the country  is whole heartedly
""
""
""
Well if it is not easy  but I think if one tries to be
""
""
""
""
""
""
Are all hostages of the same ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Is the motivation the same ?
""
""
""
""
""
What is the background  ?
""
""
opinion will assert itself 
""
""
""
But I think negotiation is part of the process of high-jacking 
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Give more time to investigative forces to find out where these
""
""
See if  if they can be rescued
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
personally taking a view that is alright  was
""
""
""
""
""
""
I now feel perhaps that was 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Is it not the same blood  ?
""
""
 friends
""
""
Miss Akhtar what is  ?
""
""
My solution is that the government should take strong  uh
""
""
Mr Sahay the difficulty is  Mr Verghese
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
most 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We are agreed  uh a need for a national
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
National and international
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

 right
""
""
Would you like to add something in 
""
""
""
must support it 
""
""
George  ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Well it is uh 
""
""
But also try and understand the psychology 
""
