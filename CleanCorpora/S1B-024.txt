This man was lucky 
Mr Doraswamy who has been in captivity now for weeks of
agonizing weeks 
Agonizing both for his family and for the nation 
We still don't know when he is and if he is going to be released
Now terrorism itself is a form of blackmail 
But holding hostages is even worse 
We have here now on my immediate left Mr George Verghese
 the distinguished journalist and Mr Jamanadas Akhtar the
distinguished writer 
Both happened to be members of the Press Council 
But we have resisted the temptation of discussing George's
 famous report 
Because George has better face his critics not his
supporters 
Now George would you give us some of the national and
international dimensions of this holding hostages 
Well taking of hostages has been with us for sometimes 
Uh throughout history hostages have been used as a means of
building up pressure on authority of whatever kind 
In more recent times we have seen high-jacking as taking up
hostages in the air 
Whole groups of perfectly innocent people who are flying
from one place to some other destination 
And using that to ask for whatever it is left the
captors wanted 
Around the ground as we've seen in many part of the
world and in our own country uh the taking of hostages is again being
used as a means to pressurise authority 
To use to specific demands that are made by various 
groups that take them in captivity 
 We've just seen the clip about the Swedes who
were taken hostages in Kashmir and U F F to Mr Doraswamy 
But we have the same problem in other parts of India in
Assam in Andhra Pradesh may be in Punjab 
And in other parts of the world in Iran in Lebanon and uh
 elsewhere 
So that this is becoming a universal phenomenon and one which
 civilize nations and government and communities have to fight 
 It's not an easy task because it is traumatic both
for the individuals and their families as well as to the governments who
have to decide and for the community at large 
Miss Akhtar with a special background of Kashmir
connection would you like to through some light 
Yes 
I would like to confine myself to the problem in
Kashmir 
I remember that in nineteen seventy-seven when I was in
Birmingham the Kashmir Liberation Front leaders were there
They had their headquarters 
They had abducted a senior diplomat from the India
 Indian High Commission 
They wanted to get release Mr Makbul Butt 
But when the government didn't release they killed that
Indian diplomat 
And after that Makbul Gutt Butt 
was hanged in Tihar jail 
The same Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front British 
news alleged Major Amanulla had their head quarters in
Muzaffarabad and also in Karachi 
 He went he run away to America 
when the government wanted to arrest him 
He came back to Kashmir and came back to Kashmir
 and Pakistan 
He organized a gang and he started terrorism 
Uh at the first uh his uh party didn't uh
indulged in kidnapping 
But there're other groups in Kashmir 
The main group is Hizbul Mujahideen 
It is controlled by the Jamait-e-Islami of Pakistan 
And its head in Pakistan is Kazi Hussain Ahmed 
 This this Jamait as you remember I
think that in the last phase of the Bangladesh government these
Jamait Islami workers they picked up several uhm professors 
doctors and others and killed them in Dacca 
And this Jamait Islami it was accused of uh hiring the
services of uhm of Sayed Akbar who had assassinated Mr Liyakat Ali
Khan 
Another worker of the Jamait Islami had assassinated Dr Khan
Sahib 
And now they have uh so many workers there're so
many terrorist a a armed terrorist
They had uh fighting
They were fighting in Afghanistan 
Then they shifted to Muzaffarabad 
They are infiltrating into Kashmir valley of Kashmir 
And mainly this this gang is responsible for kidnapping the
uh intellectuals professors engineers and others
You imply that our friend and neighbour is actively involved
Yes it is actively involved 
 He will not it will he will not say
that he is actively or any way involved in it
For instance in ninety-seven forty-seven when Pakistan
attacked Kashmir the Pakistan government said no we're 
not involved in it 
These are some tribals who are who has gone there to help
their brothers 
In sixty-five when Pakistan again attacked Kashmir General
Ayub Khan said no we are not concerned with it 
The people of Kashmir has risen in rebellion in
nineteen seventy-one they attacked again Kashmir 
And when general Zia at uh induced or 
 organized a rebellion in in Afghanistan he
said no we're not concerned with the rebellion 
 We're just helping these uh uh sharnarthis
 from Afghanisthan 
 We're not giving anything uh uh arms or weapons or
other anything to these uh persons 
Now this same group headed by that Gulbadan Hikmat Yar 
is organizing these raids 
 Pakistan government is supplying weapons and 
we know that what is going going on in Karachi now Jamait Islami
says that its workers are being kidnapped and and tortured and
assassinated in Karachi by their political elements 
 One word 
Are there training schools for kidnapping too do they
Yes they have 
 They they have kidnapping and training
schools for kidnapping and terrorism around Muzaffarabad and then
in tribal area 
George do you agree with this uh analysis or view 
Well I I'm not sure about the background and the 
uh details
Because question of kidnapping and hostages is not confined 
to Kashimr as I said it's a phenomenon one finds uh in 
 many many places in our own country and abroad 
The question is why is it done ?
 It's a form of psychological warfare to build pressure
 whether for political aims or for other aims 
Now in Kashmir there are several groups 
You mentioned the Swedes 
I think uh they were detained by particular group I am
not sure whether Jungbaz Jungbaz the the Jungbaz force 
 I'm not sure whether it is the same group that has uh kidnapped
 Jungbaz Jungbaz 
Is it true that the groups run into hundreds now 
More than one hundred
 What the 
More the official count is about one hundred and
forty-three
Uhm 
But here again the the problem that the authorities face
 is in dealing with uh a multitude of different groups which
have perhaps different sub-motivations within a larger purpose 
And the question that the country has to face is whether in the
Kashmir or elsewhere 
How does one deal with this ?
Does one submit ?
Does one give in ?
Or does one hold out and with what consequences ? 
but it 
I think this is the central issue that needs to be faced 
 But it 
It it suits our friendly neighbour to have as many
groups as possible
So that you know you can't deal with anyone particular 
 So that no political solution is possible isn't it
 ?
 Well 
Well that well that may be so
Uhm 
But as I would say if one looks at the problem in Assam 
Alpha or peoples war group in Andhra it's a different
set of circumstances there 
But kidnappings yeah have been used as a prime
instrument of pressure
Therefore it's not just Kashmir and I think we need to
look at this not as isolated problems
Kashmir or Andhra or Assam or anywhere else 
But to try and fasten a national approach to dealing with the
problem that could adopt anywhere for the variety of political 
and other reasons
 Yeah 
But you see even the former Home Minister's 
 daughter was kidnapped and there was prompt action 
One criticism was that they acted propmtly because he was the Home
Minister of the country 
Yes 
Now in the case of others it drags on as in case of
Dorayswamy for weeks 
Would you view this as a moral problem as a legal problem 
as a national problem 
How would you categorise this problem George ?
Well it's not a legal problem 
 It's really illegal 
 It's beyond the bounds of the law and and and the
constitution
Yeah 
It is a moral problem uhm and a political
problem
 Uhm 
Uhm
The kidnapping of the Home Minister the former Home Minister
Mufti uh Sayeed's daughter uh Rubia Sayeed was perhaps
the first of this latest series 
And may be thinking a new government had come into being and a new
chapter was opening there was some pressure on the government to release 
uh to negotiate with the uh captors of this young lady and secure her
release
And the other view was the government should have held out 
Because there was strong criticism of the kidnapping of a woman
 which was considered to be unIslamic against any of the
traditions that were being upheld uh as the course which the struggle
was being waged 
But for what ever reason the government gave in 
I must confess that I myself for that time went along with the
feeling that all right if the release is granted uh and this
young hostage is released Miss Sayeed uh may be that's a good
thing 
But I think perhaps we need to think afresh because once that
 is has happened it has made it more difficult
for the government in successive cases to take a stand because the
question immediately uh raised is well why aren't you
negotiating for the release of this hostage ?
Is it because he or she does not have a Home Minister 
as a father or some other very important person as a brother 
And does not the life of an ordinary average person count as
much ?
That is the dilemma that we now face 
Perhaps the time has come when I think across the board we
have to take a view whether it is Kashmir or Andhra or Assam or
 one word or anywhere else 
Whether it is a government of one complexion or another call
an all party meeting to take a national view of how the nation should
deal with hostages 
Otherwise one is going to be blackmailed all along the line
everywhere by anybody 
What do you think Miss Akhtar Mansoor
 Two word I feel that there is no difference 
between kidnapping for ransom or kidnapping for putting pressures 
to get the criminals released 
What happens a man murders six seven eight twenty 
 per persons 
When he is arrested his party kidnaps any person 
Maybe two three four persons
A professor may be a doctor may be engineer or or a high
official 
And they say that you release our criminal friend 
otherwise we will assassinate your persons
Yes
Now this is I think this is a crime 
And no government should give in 
What happens when you start releasing these the 
persons the kidnappers they feel that their position has become
strong 
George if I may express my own view life is more
complex than particular formulation 
Yes 
Uh there can not be a white and black case of either you
release or not release 
Situations will differ 
Circumstances will differ personalities will differ 
How and in a democracy public opinion will met 
Well personalities will differ yes 
But will principles differ ?
That is the question 
And I think as Jamnadasji has said you are really bargaining
 with criminals 
Take the case of Mr Doraswamy some people have been released
 as part of the bargain uhm which was not kept by the
other side according to the government 
 Uhm 
Uh the kidnappers want one of their leaders I think it is
uh Mr Shalla to be released 
Now according to the official version Mr Shalla was
responsible uh for the killing earlier of uh some hostages
 including Prof Na Nashirul Huque 
the very distinguished Vice Chancellor of Kashmir University 
And subsiquently Mr Khera the General Manager of the H M T
plant in Shrinagar 
Now if because of the pressure of Mr Doraswamy's 
kidnapping a killer of two other hosteges earlier is to be released
 then what is the principle involved and where is 
will it end 
Because this will be go on from one hostage to
another and the government will be made to yield all along the line
And that would be unacceptable 
I think you are quite right in saying there is no absolute norm
 there is no black and white yeah that is true 
But some governments the Israeli government for instance has
taken the line that they are not going to submit to any kidnapping 
And let the kidnappers face the consequences of killing
 their hostages 
Let public opinion and their own people turned against
them because they too are under psychological pressure 
 Yeah 
So I think we need to take a national view
Otherwise I can't see this problem being uh whisked
away 
 It's going to sail us week after week in one
situation or another 
What I think we need to do is that to get together all
political parties to discuss this 
What should be the national policy that is taken ?
Whether it is a Congress government in Andhra uh Congress
government in uh Assam and opposition government in some
other place President's rule George
 Assam 
Frankly I I one or two words any unanimity on any
problem in this country 
Name me one problem on which the country is whole heartedly
 unanimously agreed 
Well if it is not easy but I think if one tries to be
still what are the principles ?
Yes
Are all hostages of the same ?
Yeah
Is the motivation the same ?
Is it political ?
Is it criminal ?
What is the background ?
Can one then distill some principles on the basis which public
opinion will assert itself 
Certainly it is one thing to negotiate 
But I think negotiation is part of the process of high-jacking 
of wearing down the opponent
Yes 
Get them confused 
Get them to contridict themselves 
Develop rival force and pressures in the other camp weaken
their resolve 
Give more time to investigative forces to find out where these
hostages are ?
See if if they can be rescued
I think that barring a two or three
political parties extremist may be in Punjab all other political
parties will join hands and support the government if the government 
wants to take some strong step 
 Yes 
George would you favour that there should not be
compromise at any cost 
What is your personal view ?
Well as I say I started out in this round ah 
personally taking a view that is alright if Rubia Sayeed was was
released 
 Ah 
I now feel perhaps that was a mistake 
 A mistake 
Because once we did that we were on the slippery
slope 
And it has been said by others are we not as good as 
that young lady ?
Is it not the same blood ?
Does the more recent hostages not have parents relatives
 friends
Miss Akhtar what is your solution ?
My solution is that the government should take strong uh
uh position and should get co-operation from the opposition parties 
Mr Sahay the difficulty is that in Punjab Mr Verghese
knows though the news have not been appeared they are not so flashed
But actually there are so many cases in which the government
 have has released criminals 
But gentleman would it be a fair summing up 
if we say that we agree that holding hostages is one of the
most criminal acts 
 And 
Absolutely
Yes 
We are agreed that there is uh a need for a national
consensus on this 
Yes 
National and international
And international and also we are agreed that the
political parties should meet 
Perhaps to that we may add that it's not enough
for political parties to meet intellectuals social workers others
The inter-state council so that state government
brought in 
 Uhm uhm uhm 
Yes brought in 
But that it is not merely a government problem 
 It's an emotional and human problem
Absolutely
Yes
And it has to be dealt with at that level 
Hope so
 That's right
Would you like to add something in about a minute 
I think that uh your solution is correct and uh we
must support it 
George ?
Yes 
Well it is uh not merely necessary to built that uh 
that that consensus 
But also try and understand the psychology at work 
So that we can deal with it
It is a form of psychological warfare
Yes
So the nation has to be prepared to accept that 
And public opinion ultimately must prevail in these matters 
 and that needs to be educated
 Than 
We may perhaps end this discussion on the note that we
 have fervently hope and pray that Doraswamy or whoever else
 or whoever is held captive probably is released 
And the government doesn't really totally surrender on this matter
Naturally our hearts goes to Mrs Doraswamy and family 
Yes
And to all others 
But this is a problem that we really must confess 
Significantly the Liberation Front has also appealed for his
release 
I hope I mean he gets released soon
On this note gentleman I thank you
Thank you
Thank you
