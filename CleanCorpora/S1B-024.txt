This man was lucky 
""
Mr Doraswamy  of
agonizing weeks 
""
Agonizing both for his family 
""
We still don't know when he is  and if he is going to be released
""
""
Now terrorism itself is a form of blackmail 
""
But holding hostages 
""
We have here now  Mr George Verghese
 the
distinguished writer 
""
Both happened to be members of the Press Council 
""
But we have resisted the temptation of discussing  George's
""
""
Because  not his
supporters 
""
Now George  and
international dimensions of 
""
""
Well taking of hostages has been 
""
Uh throughout history hostages have been  used as a means of
building up pressure 
""
In more recent times we have seen  as taking up
hostages in the air 
""
Whole groups of  who are flying
from 
""
And using that  left the
captors wanted 
""
Around the ground as  in many part of the
world and in our own  uh the taking of hostages is again being
used 
""
To use to specific demands 
groups that take them 
""
 who
were taken hostages in Kashmir 
""
But we have the same problem  in
Assam 
""
And in other parts of the world  in Lebanon and uh
""
""
So that this is becoming a universal phenomenon  and one which
""
""
 both
for the individuals and their families  as well as to the governments who
have to decide 
""
""
Miss Akhtar with a special  background of Kashmir
connection 
""
""
Yes 
""
I would like to  the problem in
Kashmir 
""
I remember that in  when I was in
Birmingham  the Kashmir Liberation Front leaders were there
""
They had their headquarters 
""
They had abducted  India
""
""
They wanted to get 
""
But when the government didn't release  that
Indian diplomat 
""
And after 
was hanged in Tihar jail 
""
The same 
news alleged  had their head quarters in
Muzaffarabad 
""
""
when the government wanted to arrest him 
""
He  came back to Kashmir
""
""
He organized a gang 
""
Uh at  uh
indulged in kidnapping 
""
But 
""
The main group is Hizbul Mujahideen 
""
It is controlled by the Jamait-e-Islami of Pakistan 
""
And its head in Pakistan is 
""
 as you remember I
think  these
Jamait Islami workers 
doctors 
""
And this Jamait Islami  uh hiring the
services of  who had assassinated Mr Liyakat Ali
Khan 
""
Another worker of the Jamait Islami  had assassinated Dr Khan
Sahib 
""
And now  so
many terrorist  terrorist
""
""
They had uh  fighting
""
They were fighting in Afghanistan 
""
Then they shifted to Muzaffarabad 
""
They are infiltrating into 
""
And mainly this  the
uh  engineers and others
""
""
You imply that our friend and neighbour is actively involved
""
""
Yes it is actively involved 
""
 say
that he is actively or  it
""
For instance  when Pakistan
attacked Kashmir 
not involved 
""
These are some tribals  who has gone there to help
their brothers 
""
In sixty-five  General
Ayub Khan said 
""
The people of Kashmir has  in
nineteen seventy-one they attacked 
""
And when general Zia 
 in Afghanistan he
said 
""
 sharnarthis
""
""
 uh uh arms or weapons or
other anything to these 
""
Now this same group 
is organizing these raids 
""
""
we know  Jamait Islami
says that its workers are being kidnapped and  and tortured and
assassinated in Karachi by their political elements 
""
""
""
""
""
Are there training schools for kidnapping too  do they
""
""
Yes they have 
""
 have kidnapping and training
schools for kidnapping  and then
in tribal area 
""
""
George do you agree with this 
""
""
Well I 
uh details
""
Because 
to Kashimr as I said 
""
""
The question is  ?
""
 to build pressure
""
""
Now in Kashmir there are several groups 
""
You mentioned 
""
I think  I am
not sure whether 
 kidnapped
""
""
""
""
""
Is it true that the groups run into hundreds now 
""
""
More  hundred
""
""
""
""
""
More  the official count is about one hundred and
forty-three
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But here again  the the problem that the authorities face
 which
have perhaps different 
""
And the question that the country has to face is whether in the
Kashmir or elsewhere 
""
How does one deal with this  ?
""
Does one submit ?
""
Does one give in  ?
""
Or does one hold out 
but it 
""
I think this is the central issue that needs to be faced 
""
""
""
""
""
It it  to have as many
groups as possible
""
So that 
""
 isn't it
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
Well that  well that may be so
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But as I would say if one looks at the problem in Assam 
Alpha  a different
set of circumstances there 
""
But kidnappings  have been used as a prime
instrument  of pressure
""
Therefore  and I think we need to
look at this not as isolated problems
""
Kashmir or Andhra 
""
But to try and fasten a national approach to dealing with the
problem that could adopt 
and other reasons
""
""
""
""
""
But you see 
""
""
One criticism was that they acted propmtly because he was the Home
Minister of the country 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Now in the case of others  it drags on as in case of
Dorayswamy for weeks 
""
Would you view this as a moral problem 
as a national problem 
""
How would you categorise this problem George  ?
""
""
Well 
""
""
""
 and the
constitution
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
It is a moral problem  and a political
problem
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
The kidnapping of the Home Minister the former Home Minister
Mufti  Sayeed was perhaps
the first of this latest series 
""
And may be thinking a new government had come into being and a new
chapter was opening there was some pressure on the government to release 
uh to negotiate  uh captors of this young lady and secure her
release
""
And the other view was the government should have held out 
""
Because there was strong criticism of the kidnapping of a woman
 against any of the
traditions that were being upheld  the struggle
was being waged 
""
But for what ever reason the government 
""
I must confess that I myself for that time went along with the
feeling that all right  this
young hostage is released Miss Sayeed  a good
thing 
""
But I think perhaps we need to think afresh  because once that
 it has made it more difficult
for the government in  to take a stand because the
question immediately  why aren't you
negotiating  ?
""
Is it because 
as a father 
""
And  does not the life of an ordinary average person count as
much  ?
""
That is the dilemma that we now face 
""
Perhaps the time has come  we
have to take a view  or Assam or
""
""
Whether it is a government of one complexion or another  call
an all party meeting to take a national view  of how the nation should
deal with hostages 
""
Otherwise one is going to be blackmailed all along the line
everywhere 
""
""
What do you think Miss Akhtar Mansoor
""
""
""
between 
to get the criminals released 
""
What happens 
""
""
When he is arrested 
""
Maybe two three four persons
""
A professor may be a doctor may be engineer or  or a high
official 
""
And they say 
otherwise we will assassinate  your persons
""
""
Yes
""
""
Now 
""
And no government should 
""
What happens when you start releasing 
persons  they feel that their position has become
strong 
""
""
George if I may express my own view  life is more
complex 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uh there can not be a white and black case of  either you
release or not release 
""
Situations will differ 
""
Circumstances will differ 
""
How 
""
""
Well personalities will 
""
But will principles  differ ?
""
That is the question 
""
And I think as  Jamnadasji has said you are really bargaining
""
""
Take the case of Mr Doraswamy  some people have been released
 by the
other side 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh the kidnappers want  one of their leaders I think it is
uh 
""
Now according to the official  Mr Shalla was
responsible  some hostages
""
the very distinguished 
""
And subsiquently  the General Manager of the H M T
plant 
""
Now if 
kidnapping  is to be released
""
will 
""
Because this will  from one hostage to
another  all along the line
""
""
And that would be unacceptable 
""
I think you are quite right in saying there is no absolute norm
""
""
But some governments  the Israeli government for instance has
taken the line that they are not going to submit to any kidnapping 
""
And let the kidnappers  of killing
""
""
Let public opinion  people turned against
them 
""
""
""
""
""
So I think we need to take a national view
""
Otherwise I can't see  whisked
away 
""
 in one
situation or another 
""
What I think we need to do  to get together all
political parties 
""
What should be the national policy that is taken  ?
""
Whether it is a Congress government in Andhra  uh Congress
government in  and opposition government in some
other place  George
""
""
""
""
""
Frankly I I  any unanimity on any
problem in this country 
""
Name me one problem on which the country  is whole heartedly
""
""
""
Well if it is not easy  but I think if one tries to be
still what are the principles  ?
""
""
Yes
""
""
Are all hostages of the same ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Is the motivation the same ?
""
Is it political ?
""
Is it criminal ?
""
What is the background  ?
""
Can one then  distill some principles on the basis which public
opinion will assert itself 
""
Certainly it is one thing to negotiate 
""
But I think negotiation is part of the process of high-jacking 
of wearing down the opponent
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Get them confused 
""
Get them to contridict themselves 
""
Develop rival force and pressures in the other camp  weaken
their resolve 
""
Give more time to investigative forces to find out where these
hostages are  ?
""
See if  if they can be rescued
""
""
I think  two or three
political parties  all other political
parties 
wants to take some strong step 
""
""
""
""
""
George would you  that there should not be
compromise at any cost 
""
What is your personal view ?
""
""
Well as I say I started out in this round 
personally taking a view that is alright  was
released 
""
""
""
""
""
I now feel perhaps that was 
""
""
""
""
""
Because  we did that we were on the slippery
slope 
""
And it has been said by others 
that young lady  ?
""
Is it not the same blood  ?
""
Does the  relatives
 friends
""
""
Miss Akhtar what is  ?
""
""
My solution is that the government should take strong  uh
uh position 
""
Mr Sahay the difficulty is  Mr Verghese
knows  they are not so flashed
""
""
But actually there are so many cases  in which the government
""
""
""
But 
if we  one of the
most 
""
""
""
""
""
Absolutely
""
""
Yes 
""
""
We are agreed  uh a need for a national
consensus on this 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
National and international
""
""
And international  that the
political parties should meet 
""
Perhaps to that we may add  not enough
for political parties to meet  others
""
""
The inter-state council  so that state government
brought in 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes brought in 
""
But that it is not merely a government problem 
""
 an emotional and human problem
""
""
Absolutely
""
""
Yes
""
""
And it has to be dealt with 
""
""
Hope so
""
""
 right
""
""
Would you like to add something in 
""
""
I think that uh  and uh we
must support it 
""
""
George  ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Well it is uh 
that 
""
But also try and understand the psychology 
""
So that we can deal with it
""
It is a form of psychological warfare
""
""
Yes
""
""
So the nation has to be prepared to accept that 
""
And public opinion ultimately must prevail in these matters 
 to be educated
""
""
""
""
""
We may perhaps end this discussion on the note  that we
 or whoever else
""
""
And the government doesn't really totally surrender on this matter
""
""
""
Naturally our hearts goes to 
""
""
Yes
""
""
And to all others 
""
But this is a problem that we really must confess 
""
""
Significantly the Liberation Front has also appealed for his
release 
""
""
I hope  I mean he gets released soon
""
On this note gentleman I thank you
""
""
Thank you
""
""
Thank you
