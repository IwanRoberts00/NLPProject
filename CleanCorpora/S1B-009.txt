All right now we've been looking at Catford's theory
of 
That doesn't mean uh you should not write 
Okay just because it's being recorded doesn't mean that you
shouldn't take down notes 
Of course you will have to 
Uh let us first look at the way he uh we have seen at
uh we have looked at his theory of language 
This is basically a model of language description which is
borrowed from Halliday 
Uh which is known as a scale in category model of uh English 
grammar 
Now let's turn to his discussion of and classification of
translation type
Now Catford's theory of translation is essentially a
product oriented theory 
Why do we call it a product oriented theory ?
Because his main attempt is to look at different kinds
of translation and classify these translations into different
categories 
 He's not looking into the mind of a translator 
He is looking at the object of translation 
The object that the translator has produced 
Which means that he is looking at the empirical product of
translation 
What has been actually produced 
And he is not looking at what was going behind the
translation in the mind of the translator 
So this theory is often called a product orientated theory of
translation because the approach here is empirical 
It tries to analyse classify categorise translations 
products of translations into different types 
Now for Catford a theroy of translation is essentially concerned
 with a certain type of relation between languages 
And therefore he calls it a branch of Comparative Linguistics 
Now in this he is very much his approach is very
much like the approach of Halliday 
Halliday also if you remember argues that translation is not an
independent branch of dis or discipline 
 
Uh it is a branch of Comparative Linguistics 
Where you compared languages so to establish the comparability
between languages 
How far they are structurally similar or dissimilar you use
translation 
Catford however goes on to define the translation process 
further 
He says translation is always unidirectional that is you can
always translate at one time from one language to another and not
vice versa 
That is translation has a direction from English into Marathi or
Marathi into English unidirection 
One direction 
At one time you can't translate from both English into Marathi as
well as Marathi into English it will have to be a unidirectional process
from one language to another 
That language from which you translate is called a source
language and the language into which you translate is called a target
language 
And translation is defined as the replacement of
 write down the definition please the replacement of
textual material in one language that is S L by eqivalent textual
material in another language 
Now obviously there are two key terms in this definition 
One is textual material and another is 
 eqivalent textual material 
The term eqivalent 
So essentially he is talking about a particular type of text and
a particular type of eqivalence 
These are the key operations key terms in translation 
So before we go on to to discuss the term of the term 
 eqivalent let us look at the types of translation 
uh that he argues there exist 
These categories of translations or types of translations are
 proposed in terms of extent of translation level of translation
and rank of translation 
Level of translation extent of translation and rank of
translation 
Let us first look at the classification according to the
extent of translation that he proposes 
 There are in each of these there are two types of
translations for in all there are six categories of translation that he
proposes 
So according to the extent to which you translate a text 
How much of the text you are translating in a syntagmatic sense
 in the linear sense
Syntagmatic means linear 
So are you taking the full text for translation or are you taking
only half of the text for translation ?
How much of of the text are you taking up
for translation based upon this this is known
as the extent of translation 
Now he says if you take the entire text for translation it is
known as full translation 
If you take only half of the text it will be partial translation
So full versus partial translation 
Now this text may be anything alright
It may be a single poem it may be a book of short stories
 collection of short stories
It may be essays a novel whatever 
It can be only a sentence also 
Text will depend upon how much you have taken as a unit which
can be once again of course sub-divided into different units
If you take the totality of the text in translation uh you
translate the entire text it is full translation if you translate only part
of it it is known as partial translation
And this relates to the term extent of translation
So he proposes three terms extent level and rank 
And the first classification according to the extent is full versus
partial translation 
Now in partial translation once again obviously some parts of the
text are left untranslated 
This may happen for various reasons for example if you are
translating the description of a marriage ceremony uh from Marathi into
English 
If there is a sentence sanaiche mangal sur 
hote ghumat hote 
How will you translate the term sanai 
 
You can't because there is no equivalent for 
sanai 
Now in that case probably we'll have to keep some of these
terms just like that in the translation 
You will have to say uh I don't know how you would translate
this into English but you will have to keep the word sanai
 if you might probably say shahnai 
 okay
To make it sound different from the Marahti item
But you are not proposing any English eqivalent term for 
shahanai or sanai 
So there may be different reasons why you increase parts
Sometimes there are no equivalent terms there are no equivalent
concepts also 
In that case case you will have to keep
the term as it is uh in the uh translated text
So there are different reasons for why you uh have to adopt
the processes of partial translation 
Now the other uh distinction that he proposes relates to the
level of language in question 
This classification according to the level of translation uh
 is proposed as total translation versus restricted translation 
Now total translation means translation made at all levels of the
source language 
When we looked at the theory of language that he was proposing he
discussed 
He said that he talks about different levels of organization of
language for example there is a phonological level there is a
morphological level there is a syntactic level 
These are all different levels of language
Now what level are you translating for example he gives
later on an example of if you write Indian Airline 
the word Indian word Indian Airline you can write that
in English I N D I A N A I R L I N E S or you can also write write it
in E and then a nukta on
top D with kana matra ya and
 na this is also possible
You can use uh Devanagari script in other words
So in restricted translation in total translation you are
taking you are proposing translation equivalence at all levels of
 the text morphological syntactic etcetera
And graphalogical also 
Now the problem is only uh you don't have equivalence between
graphalogical level 
You can't have equivalence between graphological level because these
are two substances so there won't be any equivalence between these
two
But you can say that there is equivalence in sentence structure
 noun phrases uh word okay or uh clauses main
clause-main clause relative clause-relative clause this can happen
So in total translation equivalence are proposed at all levels in
restricted translation you have you have 
replacement uh of only of few levels okay
Uh once again the third is uh the rank of translation
Now we use in traditional terminology we use free
 translation uh as a term literal translation
or free translation 
Now Catford classification of translation type here 
unbounded and bounded translation 
 Bounded is rank bound translation and unbounded
is translation which is not rank bound which shift up and down on the
scale 
Now let us look at what this means exactly 
If is there is a sentence which has a noun phrase and a verb
phrase 
You translate noun phrases as noun phrases
So article by article adjective by adjective a noun by noun 
phrase by phrase clause by clause
 This is that is the rank of there are different
ranks we know 
The rank of clause sentence phrase word and sound 
Your translation may be tied to these ranks 
As I said article by article noun by noun adjective by
adjective adverb by adverb this is verb by verb
This is possible when you translate like this it is known as
rank bound translation 
Sentence by sentence translation that is also rank bound
translation
Within that sentence you may have rank shifting 
When we were discussing the scale of rank rank shifting
 we discussed that phenomenon of rank shifting and we said that when a
sentence a clause for example functions as part of N P we say that a 
clause is actually in the higher category and the word or the phrase is
actually in the lower category 
But a clause can function as a part of the phrase 
Right ?
When we say the boy who was standing in the corner 
Now who was standing in the corner is a clause
which is part of a phrase noun phrase 
Here we see rank shifting taking place 
Where rank shifting takes place we say that it is unbounded
translation 
It is not rank bound 
Sometimes in traditional terminology when we say that this
translation is literal translation and this translation is uhm free
translation
These are the terms which we usaully proposed
You might be asked a question on this uh the difference
between traditional terminology of describing translation products and 
terminology used by Catford 
Now in traditional terminology we use the term free and literal 
in both senses 
Right in when we talk about literal translation
 we may mean uh word by word translation 
 literal translation
Word by word or we may also mean sentence by sentence
translation 
The traditional classification is rather vague 
Sentence by sentence also becomes literal word by word also
becomes literal or meaning by meaning also becomes literal 
If you translated a phrase such as Kakhet kalasa 
and gavala valasa 
If you translate this literally word by word it will give some
very funny meaning I suppose in English 
That will be literal translation where you are totally ignoring
the meaning uh you are translating each word but that meaning is
not going to be the meaning of that particular proverb there 
There can be also example I gave you some examples from the
Bible Je majakadun tijmadhye janmvile te 
A case of rank bound translation case of rank bound
translation case of literal translation 
But remember rank bound is much more clear and definite clearly
defined because you know that this is the rank of clause or sentence or
phrase or word or sound for phoneme 
Whereas in literal translation the term is rather vague because
in literal translation it can be anything 
It can be sentence uh by sentence translation word by word 
meaning by meaning okay 
But literal translation will always be rather awkward 
Unless the two languages are absolutely identical which would
very rarely be the case it would be a very awkward translation 
Whereas unbounded translation see we are establishing 
clarity between the terms that Catford proposes and the terms that have been
proposed in traditional translation criticism 
Catford proposes terms like unbounded and bounded
 
 Bounded is according to the traditional
terminology literal translation 
And we saw the difference between these two terms 
In uh unbounded translation you
can take liberties with the text that means that sometimes a whole
sentence may be translated in a word
It is possible to do that 
Or one for one word you may use one sentence 
Sometimes in unbounded translation Catford doesn't discuss this
possibility but it is possible to even delete or add portions of
the text add to the portions of the text or you can delete some parts of the
text
This is possible
