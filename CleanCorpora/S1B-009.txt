All right now  theory
""
""
That doesn't mean uh you should not write 
""
Okay just because  being recorded doesn't mean that you
""
""
Of course you will have to 
""
Uh  we have seen at
""
""
This is basically a model of language  description which is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
product oriented theory 
""
""
""
""
""
categories 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Which means that he is looking at the empirical  product of
""
""
What has been actually produced 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
products of translations into different types 
""
Now for  Catford a theroy of translation is essentially concerned
""
""
And therefore he calls it a branch of Comparative Linguistics 
""
""
much 
""
Halliday also if you remember  argues that translation is not an
independent 
""
""
""
""
Where you compared languages  so to establish the comparability
between languages 
""
How far they are structurally similar or dissimilar  you use
translation 
""
Catford however goes on to define the translation process 
""
""
He says translation is always unidirectional  you can
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
At one time you can't translate from both English into Marathi as
""
""
""
That language  is called a source
""
language 
""
""
 the replacement of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a particular type of eqivalence 
""
""
""
So before we go on to to discuss the term 
""
""
""
These categories of translations or types of translations  are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
proposes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How much  the text are you taking up
""
as the extent 
""
Now  for translation it is
""
""
If you take only half of the text  it will be partial translation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
can be  once again of course sub-divided into different units
""
If you  uh you
""
""
""
""
""
So he proposes three terms extent 
""
""
partial translation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If there is a sentence 
""
""
""
""
""
""
sanai 
""
""
terms 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But you are not proposing any English eqivalent term for 
""
""
So  there may be different reasons why you increase parts
""
""
""
""
""
the term as it is  uh translated text
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
discussed 
""
""
language for example there is a phonological level  there is a
""
""
These are all different levels of language
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 this is also possible
""
You can use uh Devanagari script in other words
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
graphalogical level 
""
""
""
""
""
But you can say that there is equivalence in  sentence structure
""
clause-main clause  this can happen
""
So in total translation equivalence are proposed at all levels in
restricted translation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 translation
""
""
""
""
""
 is rank bound translation and unbounded
""
scale 
""
""
""
""
phrase 
""
""
""
""
phrase by phrase clause by clause
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
adjective adverb by adverb  this is verb by verb
""
""
rank bound translation 
""
Sentence by sentence translation  that is also rank bound
translation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  is a clause
""
""
Here we see rank shifting taking place 
""
""
translation 
""
""
""
Sometimes in traditional terminology when we say that  this
""
translation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in both senses 
""
Right  literal translation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If you translated a phrase such as 
""
""
""
very funny meaning I suppose in English 
""
""
the meaning  but that meaning is
""
""
There can be  also example I gave you some examples from the
""
""
""
translation 
""
But remember rank bound is much more clear and definite  clearly
""
phrase or word or sound 
""
Whereas in literal translation the term is rather vague  because
""
""
""
meaning by meaning 
""
But 
""
""
very rarely be the case 
""
Whereas 
""
proposed in traditional translation criticism 
""
Catford proposes terms like  unbounded and bounded
""
""
 traditional
terminology 
""
And we saw the difference between these two terms 
""
In  you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sometimes in unbounded translation  Catford doesn't discuss this
""
the text add to the portions of the text or you can delete some parts of the
""
""
""
