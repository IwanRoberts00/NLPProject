All right now  theory
of 
""
That doesn't mean uh you should not write 
""
Okay just because  being recorded doesn't mean that you
shouldn't take down notes 
""
Of course you will have to 
""
Uh  we have seen at
uh 
""
This is basically a model of language  description which is
borrowed from 
""
Uh which is known as a scale in category model of 
grammar 
""
Now  turn to his discussion of and classification of
translation type
""
Now  a
product oriented theory 
""
Why do we call it a product oriented theory ?
""
Because  different kinds
of translation  these translations into different
categories 
""
""
""
He is looking at the object 
""
The object that the translator has produced 
""
Which means that he is looking at the empirical  product of
translation 
""
What has been actually produced 
""
And he is not looking at  behind the
translation 
""
So this theory is often called a product orientated theory of
translation because the approach here is empirical 
""
It tries to analyse 
products of translations into different types 
""
Now for  Catford a theroy of translation is essentially concerned
""
""
And therefore he calls it a branch of Comparative Linguistics 
""
Now in this  his approach is very
much 
""
Halliday also if you remember  argues that translation is not an
independent 
""
""
Uh it is a branch of Comparative Linguistics 
""
Where you compared languages  so to establish the comparability
between languages 
""
How far they are structurally similar or dissimilar  you use
translation 
""
Catford however goes on to define the translation process 
further 
""
He says translation is always unidirectional  you can
always  from one language to another and not
vice versa 
""
That is translation has a direction  from English into Marathi or
Marathi into English 
""
One direction 
""
At one time you can't translate from both English into Marathi as
well as Marathi into English  it will have to be a unidirectional process
from one language to another 
""
That language  is called a source
language  and the language into which you translate is called a target
language 
""
And translation is defined  the replacement of
 the replacement of
textual material in one language  by eqivalent textual
material in another language 
""
Now obviously 
""
One is 
""
""
The term 
""
So essentially he is talking about a particular type of text  and
a particular type of eqivalence 
""
These are the key operations key terms in translation 
""
So before we go on to to discuss the term 
""
uh 
""
These categories of translations or types of translations  are
 level of translation
and rank of translation 
""
Level of translation  and rank of
translation 
""
Let us first look at the classification  the
extent of translation 
""
 in each of these there are two types of
translations for in all there are six categories of translation that he
proposes 
""
So 
""
How much  of the text you are translating in a syntagmatic sense
 in the linear sense
""
Syntagmatic means linear 
""
So are you taking the full text  for translation or are you taking
only half of the text for translation  ?
""
How much  the text are you taking up
for translation  is known
as the extent 
""
Now  for translation it is
known as full translation 
""
If you take only half of the text  it will be partial translation
""
""
So full versus partial translation 
""
Now this text may be anything  alright
""
It may be a single poem  short stories
 collection of short stories
""
It may be essays 
""
It can be only a sentence also 
""
Text will depend upon how much you have taken as a unit  which
can be  once again of course sub-divided into different units
""
If you  uh you
translate the entire text it is full translation if you translate only part
of it it is known as  partial translation
""
And this relates to the term extent of translation
""
So he proposes three terms extent 
""
And the first classification according to the extent is full versus
partial translation 
""
Now in partial translation once again obviously some parts of the
text are left untranslated 
""
This may happen for various reasons  for example if you are
translating the description of a marriage ceremony  uh from Marathi into
English 
""
If there is a sentence 
hote 
""
How will you translate the term 
""
""
You can't 
sanai 
""
Now in that case probably  have to keep some of these
terms 
""
You will have to say uh  I don't know how you would translate
this into English but you will have to keep the word  sanai
""
 okay
""
To make it sound different from the Marahti item
""
But you are not proposing any English eqivalent term for 
shahanai 
""
So  there may be different reasons why you increase parts
""
Sometimes there are no equivalent terms there are no equivalent
concepts also 
""
In that  you will have to keep
the term as it is  uh translated text
""
So there are different reasons for why you  adopt
the processes of 
""
Now  the other uh distinction that he proposes relates to the
level of language in question 
""
This classification  uh
""
""
Now total translation means  translation made at all levels of the
source language 
""
When we looked at the theory of language that he was proposing  he
discussed 
""
He said that he  talks about different levels of organization of
language for example there is a phonological level  there is a
morphological level 
""
These are all different levels of language
""
Now  for example he gives
later on an example of 
the word  Indian Airline you can write that
in English  or you can also write write it
in  on
top  and
 this is also possible
""
You can use uh Devanagari script in other words
""
So  restricted translation in total translation you are
taking  at all levels of
 morphological syntactic etcetera
""
And graphalogical also 
""
Now the problem is only  uh you don't have equivalence between
graphalogical level 
""
You can't have equivalence between graphological level because these
are two  so there won't be any equivalence between these
two
""
But you can say that there is equivalence in  sentence structure
 main
clause-main clause  this can happen
""
So in total translation equivalence are proposed at all levels in
restricted translation 
replacement  only of few levels okay
""
Uh  the rank of translation
""
""
Now we use in traditional terminology we use  free
 translation
or 
""
Now Catford classification of translation type here 
unbounded 
""
 is rank bound translation and unbounded
is  translation which is not rank bound which shift up and down on the
scale 
""
Now let us look at what this means exactly 
""
If  there is a sentence which has a noun phrase and a verb
phrase 
""
You translate noun phrases as noun phrases
""
So article by article adjective by adjective 
phrase by phrase clause by clause
""
 there are different
ranks 
""
The rank of clause sentence phrase 
""
Your translation may be tied to these ranks 
""
As I said  noun by noun adjective by
adjective adverb by adverb  this is verb by verb
""
This is possible when you translate like this  it is known as
rank bound translation 
""
Sentence by sentence translation  that is also rank bound
translation
""
Within that sentence you may have 
""
When we were discussing  rank shifting
 we discussed that phenomenon of rank shifting and we said that when a
sentence a clause for example functions as part of N P we say that a 
clause is actually in the higher category  and the word or the phrase is
actually in the lower category 
""
But a clause can function as a part of the phrase 
""
Right  ?
""
When we say 
""
""
Now  is a clause
which is part of a phrase 
""
Here we see rank shifting taking place 
""
Where rank shifting takes place we say that it is unbounded
translation 
""
It is not rank bound 
""
Sometimes in traditional terminology when we say that  this
translation is literal translation and this translation is  free
translation
""
These are the terms which we usaully proposed
""
You might be asked a question on this  the difference
between traditional terminology of describing translation products and 
terminology used by Catford 
""
Now in traditional terminology we use the term free and literal 
in both senses 
""
Right  literal translation
""
 literal translation
""
Word by word  or we may also mean sentence by sentence
translation 
""
The traditional classification is rather vague 
""
Sentence by sentence also becomes literal  word by word also
becomes literal or meaning by meaning also becomes literal 
""
If you translated a phrase such as 
and 
""
If you translate this literally word by word  it will give some
very funny meaning I suppose in English 
""
That will be literal translation  where you are totally ignoring
the meaning  but that meaning is
not going to be the meaning of that particular proverb there 
""
There can be  also example I gave you some examples from the
Bible 
""
A case of  case of rank bound
translation 
""
But remember rank bound is much more clear and definite  clearly
defined  because you know that this is the rank of clause or sentence or
phrase or word or sound 
""
Whereas in literal translation the term is rather vague  because
in literal translation it can be anything 
""
It can be sentence uh by sentence translation word by word 
meaning by meaning 
""
But 
""
Unless the two languages are absolutely identical which  would
very rarely be the case 
""
Whereas 
clarity between the terms that Catford proposes and the terms that have been
proposed in traditional translation criticism 
""
Catford proposes terms like  unbounded and bounded
""
""
 traditional
terminology 
""
And we saw the difference between these two terms 
""
In  you
can take liberties with the text  that means that sometimes a whole
sentence may be translated in a word
""
It is possible to do that 
""
Or one for one word you may use 
""
Sometimes in unbounded translation  Catford doesn't discuss this
possibility but it is possible to even delete  portions of
the text add to the portions of the text or you can delete some parts of the
text
""
This is possible
