<I>
May it please Your Honour 
Now this is a case in which originally there were five
accused persons 
There were five accused persons 
And the police was able to get the presence of only three
persons they could arrest three persons 
So we have started with the case against these three accused
 two have clarified right from beginning interruption they
are not there no one of them 
Thereafter Your Honour was pleased to frame a charge against
them on two accounts the charges execute them 
interruption 
Against three persons interruption 
Three accounts interruption 
Which is that charge number sir ? interruption 
That is there that I'll I'll I will be giving up that
charge Sir thirty seventh read is Bombay Police Act for that
purpose I have not laid the evidence sir 
Because in order to prove the charge under Bombay Police Act 
it is necessary for the prosecution to show that the promolgation
 order was duly exhibited and it was promulgated in
various parts and not only that but there was it was specially also
there interruption yes yes the Bandra police station then I have
to examine the constable I have to examine the police officer I have
to produce the diary entries showing all those things which has not
been done in this particular case 
Therefore as it has cou code 
number three two words Your Honour can take it that the
prosecution has not laid any evidence on that account 
Therefore now the first charge is that your accused number one
two three along with absconding accused Motu Mota
Umesh and Kadam on or about the third day of April
nineteen eighty-eight at about eleven ten hours in presence of
the common intention at open place near Harbour railway line 
 shun shunting track Pragati nagar 
Matunga Dharavi Bombay at nine committed murder by intentionally
 and all knowingly causing the death of Iyengar 
Silkrumal Pandu and thereby committed an offence punishable under
section three naught two read with section thirty-four of the Indian
Penal Code and within the cognizance of this court 
Now second this is one charge of murder 
Murder in respect of Iyengar 
Second charge is under section three nought seven Sir 
That charge is that you accused number one two three 
along with the absconding accused Umesh and Kadam 
on about third April on the same day at about eleven thirty-five in
presence of common intention did an act of causing with
 Rampuri knife and koyta causing heart
attack near Government Milk booth opposite Madrasis Masjid Dr
Ambedkar road Matunga Bombay with such intent interruption 
ahn with such intention and under such circumstances that if by
that act you had caused the death of Kadu Hosappa
Achari Kadu Hosappa Achari you would have been guilty
of murder but the Kadu he is survived and therefore 
and that you caused the hurt to the two words and thereby
committed an offence punishable under section three nought seven of the
Indian Penal Code with read with section thirty-four of the Indian Penal
code and within the cognizance of Your Honours court Sir 
Now therefore there are two charges one charge 
interruption yes interruption because I have not laid any 
interruption in entire view 
No evidence has been laid 
Therefore as we got third cause Prosecution itself is that
they have not proved the third charge because no evidence was there on
the third charge Sir 
Now Your Honour as far as the background of this case is
concerned actual interruption actually we started
recording the evidence on fourteenth October ninety-two 
Prior to that this case went from various courts to various
courts and thereafter ultimately it came to this court Sir 
Till then the accused prevent at the Trial Court from
commencing the trial Sir interruption did not allowed 
interruption 
They made all efforts to see that the accused that the
advocates are made to run away 
They would say that we don't want these advocates we don't want
that advocates and ultimately even the court also cancelled those
prosecutors they made allegations against the court also 
All types of allegations were made and subsequently the case
has come to this court 
Moment the case came to our court we we immediately framed
the charge and started with an assertion proceeded from day to day
 right upto eighteen December 
On eighteen December ninety-two I closed my case 
Thereafter it was expected that immediately Your Honour will
 take upto thirtieth 
That Your Honour has done 
And after two words judgement of the accused it
was expected that I should start with the argument and the defence
should do immediately commence with their arguments 
Unfortunately Mr Seth the Defence Advocate on behalf of
number two and three went out of Bombay making a promise to this court
 that he is going to give a written argument or if he is not
 then he will come and argue himself and at the most it will take
another two or three months so Your Honour was to give then didn't 
interruption by March interruption 
And he said that but he promised that even prior to that
 he would send the written argument so the interruption 
 haan they have got this to say 
But nothing of this kind kind was done 
 It's only about couple of weeks that only two or
three weeks back that he happened to be here in Bombay and that is
how we have fixed up this particular date for argue 
Therefore lot of delay has been caused in recording the
evidence and the arguments because we started with the 
recording of the evidence on fourteenth October and on now on fifteenth
September I'm arguing the matter 
Therefore I'm sorry that I will have to take Your Honour
through the evidence of each witness because nobody is expected it is
not expected the court to remember what evidence was laid one
year back practically one year back 
So I will have to go through each and every witness read
the evidence and thus start commenting on it 
So I will start with the first witness P W one Sir 
interruption 
In all in all in this particular case are examine 
twenty-four Prosecution interruption witnesses 
To divide this into two separate compartments because some
of the witnesses will be in respect of murder some will be in respect of
the second charge interruption and some witnesses will be common
witnesses namely when both both the accused both the persons
were taken to hospital the same constable there he made diary entries
etcetera 
So there would be some common witnesses Sir 
Then regarding scene of offence and all these thing some common
witnesses will be there 
So now we'll I'll start reading P W one Sir so
that will give the list of F I R 
If Your Honour wants this facts I'll give the this facts
Sir interruption 
Now this has not been done in chronological order 
We have not examined the witnesses in a chronological order 
Therefore some witnesses are pertaining to first charge
immediately some pertaining to second charge 
So whichever witness was available those witnesses were
brought by the officers because the accused as I have said 
in the beginning when I open up the case I said that these accused
are notorious type kind of notorious character bad character 
accused 
And witnesses were afraid of coming 
So the police officer Mr Ansari and other officers they had to
take lot of pains to go and collect them search them and then
get them here in the court 
So it which ever is available I started examining 
So normally otherwise what happens normally our practice
is a a all prosecutors that 
when we find that there is charge of murder then we start examining all
the witnesses regarding that particular charge in a chronological order
 then three nought seven same order and then some common things
 Doctors etcetera they are all common thing which are there 
But in this case unfortunately for the prosecution it was not
possible because victims were afraid they were running away and
the officer has to go get them locate them and then they
were brought here interruption 
Yes because they were afraid running away means they were
they made themslves scared to the police officer 
The moment they found that some officer from Dharavi police
station interruption 
The people are interested but unfortunately for the prosecution 
two accused are were abscounding and they are still abscounding 
and and those accu accused persons
has a gang and this gang was moving in that area with the use of this
 tho constant fear in the minds of witnesses that these two
other persons may not directly but through some other persons may
attack them and therefore they were not willing to come interruption
These interruption of course this gang consisted of
this main five persons out of which two are now ab ab 
 absconding interruption ah yes 
And apart from those those two persons again formed another
gang because these three persons were not there they formed another gang
 but then they were not directly coming in Dharavi area they were
sending those persons in Dharavi area because they knew the moment they
come to Dharavi area these officers from Dharavi Police Station Ansari
 and other other Jadhav they will definitely arrest them because
they would arrest them 
Therefore they would not come personally 
They would send their other gundas there in that
locality to settle everything interruption 
And therefore this is the this therefore when I read the
evidence some of the witnesses will be for first account some of the
witnesses of second account 
So I will then up subsequently while concluding the
argument cough I will see that all those witnesses are I will
 some arrange and then I will say that I will point out the
exact interruption haan 
Then I will say therefore in this case this is the scene
regarding this this witness is regarding this 
That we can register afterwards 
So therefore I will now start with the P W one cough 
Now the important point in this particular case is that
this incident that taken place on the on the on Sunday 
It was on Sunday third October 
 I'm sorry third April sir was Sunday 
interruption no third sir 
It was third April nineteen eighty-eight interruption
 haan nineteen eighty-eight 
It was Sunday and it was in the morning at about eleven ten 
Eleven ten or so morning time interruption 
At an open place near Harbour railway line shunting track
 that was the interruption 
So I am I am talking about the first offence of murder 
interruption 
So now was of the interruption Masjid Masjid 
So now what I am giving is the first offence of murder took
place first 
So therefore I am giving this place interruption 
At open place near Harbour railway line 
interruption Matunga 
Harbour railway line shunting track 
This track which was not operated except for shunting purposes
 Pragati Nagar hutment at Matunga Sir One word 
but interruption Dharavi sir interruption no it comes
in Dharavi sir 
And now as it has this is the incident regarding murder of
 Iyengar and now I'm giving the timing of the 
other persons 
That is uh Kaju Kadu 
 Hosappa Achari regarding three naught seven there the
timing is about eleven thirty interruption 
No because we have started with the evid I am why I am
 tak talking about this because the P
W one is Kadu Achari when I read the evidence I'll 
be reading the the evidence of Kadu Achari 
Therefore I'm giving the timing Sir 
 Kadu Hosappa Achari interruption because we
started with the evidence of Kadu Achari P W therefore 
I'm giving this first these particular timing sir 
So this incidence took place at the Masjid Dr
Ambedkar Raod opposite some Madras Maderesa Maderesa 
 Ka Kazi Masjid Ambedkar road Matunga
And this took place at about eleven thirty sir 
Now there is a connection between this murder and that murder
in the sense that Iyengar happened to be the 
brother-in-law of Achari 
 Iyengar who was dead was murdered was the
brother-in-law of the witness Achari interruption 
He is husband of his sister 
I will tell Your Honour why I examined this Achari 
person
