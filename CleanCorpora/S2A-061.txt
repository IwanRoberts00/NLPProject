May it please Your Honour 
""
Now  in which originally there were five
accused persons 
""
There were five accused persons 
""
And the police was able to  get the presence of only three
persons they could arrest three persons 
""
So we have started with the case  against these three accused
 they
are not there 
""
Thereafter  Your Honour was pleased to frame a charge against
them 
interruption 
""
Against three persons 
""
Three accounts 
""
Which is that charge number sir 
""
That is there  I will be giving up that
charge Sir  for that
purpose I have not laid the evidence sir 
""
Because in order to prove the charge under Bombay Police Act 
it is necessary for the prosecution to show  promolgation
 in
various parts  and not only that but there was it was specially also
there  then I have
to examine the constable  I have
to produce the diary entries  which has not
been done in this particular case 
""
Therefore as it has 
number three  that the
prosecution has not laid any evidence on that account 
""
Therefore now the first charge is  that your accused number one
two three  Mota
Umesh  on or about the third day of April
nineteen  in presence of
the common intention 
""
Matunga  committed murder by intentionally
""
Silkrumal Pandu  and thereby committed an offence punishable under
section three naught two  read with section thirty-four of the Indian
Penal Code 
""
Now second this is one charge of murder 
""
Murder in respect of 
""
Second charge is 
""
That charge is 
along with the 
on about third April on the same day  in
presence of common intention did an act  with
 causing heart
attack near Government Milk booth  Masjid Dr
Ambedkar road 
ahn  and under such circumstances that if by
that act  Hosappa
Achari  you would have been guilty
of murder 
and that  and thereby
committed an offence punishable under section three nought seven of the
Indian Penal Code  with read with section thirty-four of the Indian Penal
code 
""
Now therefore there are two charges 
interruption 
interruption 
""
No evidence has been laid 
""
Therefore as we got third cause  that
they have not proved the third charge because no evidence was there  on
the third charge Sir 
""
Now Your Honour  as far as the background of this case is
concerned  actually we started
recording the evidence 
""
Prior to that this case  went from various courts to various
courts 
""
Till then the accused  from
commencing the trial Sir 
interruption 
""
They made all efforts to see that the accused  that the
advocates are made to run away 
""
They would say that we don't want these advocates we don't want
that advocates  even the court also cancelled those
prosecutors 
""
All types of allegations were made  and subsequently the case
has come to this court 
""
Moment the case came to our court  we immediately framed
the charge  proceeded from day to day
""
""
On eighteen December ninety-two I closed my case 
""
Thereafter it was expected  that immediately Your Honour will
""
""
That Your Honour has done 
""
And after  it
was expected that I should start with the argument  and the defence
should do 
""
Unfortunately Mr Seth  on behalf of
number two and three went out of Bombay  making a promise to this court
 or if he is not
 and at the most it will take
another two or three months so Your Honour was to give then didn't 
interruption 
""
And he said that  prior to that
""
""
""
But nothing of this kind 
""
 only two or
three weeks back  and that is
how we have fixed up this particular date for 
""
Therefore lot of delay has been caused  in recording the
evidence 
recording of the evidence on fourteenth October  and on now on fifteenth
September 
""
Therefore  sorry that I will have to take Your Honour
through the evidence of each witness  it is
not expected the court to remember  one
year back 
""
So I will have to go through each and every  read
the evidence and thus start commenting on it 
""
So I will start with the first witness P W one Sir 
interruption 
""
In all 
twenty-four Prosecution 
""
To divide this into  because some
of the witnesses will be in respect of murder  some will be in respect of
the second charge  and some witnesses will be common
witnesses  persons
were taken to hospital  the same constable there he made diary entries
etcetera 
""
So there would be some common witnesses Sir 
""
Then regarding scene of offence and all these thing some common
witnesses will be there 
""
So now  so
that will give the list of F I R 
""
If Your Honour wants this facts  give the this facts
Sir 
""
Now this has not been done in chronological order 
""
We have not examined the witnesses in a chronological order 
""
Therefore some witnesses are pertaining to  first charge
immediately some pertaining to second charge 
""
So whichever witness was available  those witnesses were
brought by the officers 
in the beginning when I open up the case  that these accused
are notorious type kind 
accused 
""
And witnesses were afraid of coming 
""
So the police officer Mr Ansari  and other officers they had to
take lot of pains  and then
get them here in the court 
""
So it 
""
So normally otherwise what happens  practice
is 
when we find that there is charge of murder  then we start examining all
the witnesses regarding  that particular charge in a chronological order
 and then some common things
""
""
But in this case unfortunately for the prosecution it was not
possible  and
the officer has to go  they
were brought here 
""
Yes because they were afraid  they were
they made themslves 
""
The moment they  found that some officer from Dharavi police
station 
""
The people are interested but unfortunately for the prosecution 
two accused are 
and and those  persons
has a gang  with the use of this
 that these two
other persons may  may
attack them and therefore they were not willing to come  interruption
""
""
These  this gang consisted of
this main five persons 
""
""
And apart from those  those two persons again formed another
gang because these three persons were not there  they formed another gang
 they were
sending those persons in Dharavi area because they knew  the moment they
come to Dharavi area  these officers from Dharavi Police Station Ansari
 because
they would arrest them 
""
Therefore they would not come personally 
""
They would send their other  there in that
locality 
""
And therefore this is the  when I read the
evidence some of the witnesses will be  some of the
witnesses of second account 
""
So I will then up  concluding the
argument  all those witnesses are I will
 the
exact 
""
Then I will say therefore in this case  this is the scene
regarding this this witness is regarding this 
""
That we can register afterwards 
""
So therefore I will now start with the P W one 
""
Now  that
this incident that taken place on the on the 
""
It was on Sunday 
""
""
interruption 
""
It was third April  interruption
""
""
It was Sunday and it was in the morning at about eleven ten 
""
Eleven ten or so 
""
At an open place  shunting track
""
""
So I am I am talking about the first offence of murder 
interruption 
""
So now was of 
""
So now what I am giving is the first  offence of murder took
place first 
""
So therefore I am giving this place 
""
At open place 
interruption 
""
Harbour railway line 
""
This track which was not operated  except for shunting purposes
""
but  no it comes
in Dharavi sir 
""
And now as it has  of
""
other persons 
""
That is uh 
 there the
timing is about eleven thirty 
""
No because  I am why I am
 because the P
W one is 
be reading the 
""
Therefore 
""
 because we
started with the evidence of 
I'm 
""
So this incidence took place  Dr
Ambedkar Raod 
 Matunga
""
""
And this took place 
""
Now  there is a connection between this murder and that murder
in the sense 
brother-in-law of 
""
 was the
brother-in-law of the witness 
""
He is husband of 
""
I will
