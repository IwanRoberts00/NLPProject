<I>
I extend a very happy welcome to Dr Rajni Badlani 
the English Studies Officer the British Council Division Bombay 
I am also very happy to welcome to Dr Shastri 
whom we have been missing for quite sometime 
Uh may I request honourable Chairman to offer a
bouquet to Dr Badlani as a sign of welcome and request
honourable Chairman to offer a bouquet to Dr Shastri who has come after
such a long time claps 
And now that Dr Shastri is back and Dr Badlani is here I
hope that they continue to be with us for quite sometime 
When we want the British Council help and we want Dr 
Shastri's guidance 
So with these words I conclude my welcome speech and
well I here request honourable chairman to say a few words A few
words 
It gives me a great pleasure uh to welcome Dr Badlani
 and our beloved Dr Shastri once again to join us 
We were really missing him for the last so many months 
Now with the God's grace he is back and hope he
will be with us for many years to come 
With his guidance and assistance of British Council
 the board of studies I think has come up with the nice 
text book of standard nine 
And they are also planning to have that the same book
 of the same type 
As I understand this is a this book has a new approach 
It is a quite a good blend of structural approach
 and uh 
Communicative
Communicative skills 
In fact I don't know what is exactly structural approach and
communications 
But as you are mentioning it again and again I am
getting to it 
Any good change is always welcome 
But as you know Dr Badlani no change is accepted properly
 or whole heartedly unless it is properly delivered or 
people are made to understand it in the right direction
Yes 
So it should be our endeavour it should be our 
one word it includes Board of Studies State Board 
teachers and students 
We must prepare them to accept this change 
And unless we prepare them to accept this change unless we
convince them what is good in this we'll have 
very difficult great difficulty to drive home 
It is not only true for this English this will be true for
whole syllabus since our approach to the new syllabus is also
changed 
We have included many new topics in the syllabus 
The Board is thinking to have orientation of all teachers
 in all subjects 
It may be not may not be a exhaustive one 
But at least two-three days orientation to all teachers 
And particularly for this English language we require more
orientation because it being a foreign language it's not
our mother tongue it is altogether different and difficult one
 to understand and learn 
And as we all know the condition of English in
rural areas in particular 
 We'll have to have more efforts on this one 
 It's of high syllabus exercise it's a
communication skill and here only we lack in communication 
Teachers themselves lack in communication 
They can only read and ask students to hear listen 
and repeat the same thing 
But they hardly speak 
So we will have to inculcate them inculcate into them 
skill of speaking 
If they speak then only the students can be able to 
speak something 
So in order to prepare them this Board of studies has
envisaged a programme 
And for that programme atleast we will again request 
British Council and particularly Mrs Badlani who has extended 
help 
We intend to in the initial stages we are 
have thought of preparing cassettes 
Am I correct ?
Video cassettes
Video cassettes 
But somehow Dr Shastri was not feeling well that
scheme has also not come up very well 
Nevertheless we have not dropped that we have modified the
scheme 
We will modify it 
Instead of having a video cassettes we'll have audio
cassettes 
 We'll have audio cassettes 
And uh I think sixty percent work of the audio cassettes has
been already completed 
Even if fifty percent has to be completed we will complete it
And after the completion of recording we will have 
efforts we will make efforts to supply at least two cassettes 
per school so that each school will have a cassette to listen
 listen in a proper intonation listen correct English 
And if they listen correct English they may speak correct 
For that also we may request British Council State
Board and other voluntary organisations to help us 
Secondly we're also planning to have master
trainers course 
Nearly there are sixteen thousand secondary schools 
If we take one teacher per school we'll have to
train minimum fifteen thousand secondary school teachers in
English for English 
To train fifteen thousand secondary school whether 
 two words itself 
For that also we'll have to have first resource
persons 
To train the resource person we have to have some master
trainers to train the master trainers we'll have to have
the help of Board of studies then teachers what you call them
 uh experts then book writers and British Council 
For you also Madam we request your organisation to have
 uh your help 
We will also request Central Institute of English to
extend their help 
Because if we can if we can train good master trainers
 then we can have the good resource persons and then only 
there can be percu good percolation to the teachers there 
If master trainers are not good the resource persons will not
be good 
And if resource persons are not good very few will be very
less will be percolated to the teachers themselves 
Uh in that way let's have straight way from the
 original resource only that is English British Council 
We will have master trainers from there only 
So that is also one request 
And these master trainers or these workshops here we'll
 prepare or we intend to prepare teachers handbook or teachers
guide 
Atleast then we'll have something to fall back 
In the school they will have nothing to fall back 
In big villages or big cities teachers have got 
what you call that seminars workshops but in isolated 
villages they hardly get any or guidance 
So our teachers' handbook of particular subject
 will be very handy for them 
So one good teachers' handbook will definitely
help them for that also we will have the assistance 
I will request for them as for Dr Shastri I'll get an
assistance 
I think it is worth 
I request representative of British Council to
extend their fullest possible cooperation to our endeavour and
make this project a successful one 
If uh with dis discussion 
 any finer points will come up uh I'll not spell out each
and everything 
Uh they have still some scope for the discussion otherwise 
laughter 
What will be the use of this meeting 
Thank you very much 
Now Dr Shastri is here 
We have regained our all hope 
He is our hope he is our moral support 
 and he is our guide 
 Right 
 Right 
We were really missing him for last nearly six seven
months 
Now he is here but even then we don't worry trouble him
much 
Sure 
He must relax rest and work only when he enjoys
it 
You must work as long as you enjoy it otherwise you
should not you should take rest 
 Yes yes 
With these words I conclude my opening talk and we'll
 have one word occasion 
Thank you very much 
Uhm I 
 May I request Mrs Badlani 
At first I like to thank you all very much for giving me such
a warm welcome 
And uh I must say that uh professionally I have been
English Studies Officer of the British Council 
I have been extremely pleased with the work that the Maharashtra
Board has been doing and uh with whatever little support we
have been able to extend through what ever limited funds we have 
When I compare it to this uh extremely new project in the
Central Board of Secondary Education 
I find that uh we have definitely not got even one tenth
of the facilities and one which they have got because they have been
funded by another agency the O B A 
Ah but nevertheless with whatever limited funds we have had at the
Council in Bombay I have kept Maharashtra Board my top most priority in
my budgeting claps 
Thank you
And uh I will continue to do so 
I am going to now put in a request for you know the other
uh help that you have asked for which might mean uh may be more
than one specialist 
So far we have only been managing to get one specialist and
uh for her also it has not been very easy to be working on three or four
different books a centre 
And now with the teaching training uh module I think we
will definitely need more than one person 
So uh I'll like to uh reiterate the fact that I
am going to continue my support as much as I can for the Board
And it's very heartening to see that you know the
books have actually been produced and are supposed to be out from the press
in May 
Ah in this context could I make a request of support uh since
our funding also is very strictly evaluated and monitored it would be
very helpful for me if I have I am given even if it is the rough draft
of the book 
So that I can say okay this we have produced 
This is the output of our input 
And now for the further output we need this much input
It will strengthen my uh case where my asking for fund is
concerned 
Because here I can show concrete evidence 
It is no good saying that the thing is taking place you know 
it's in the press etcetera 
So uh and why I am asking it now and not when the final
printout is out because uh I'll be asking for funds in
April or May 
So it's at the time of asking the funds that I would
like to show some concrete evidence of whatever input we have made
so far 
Uhm I think I will not say much about uh what I want to
at this stage because we it'll a lot of points will come up in
the discussion 
Uhm but from our experience with the C B S E project 
uh we have learnt a couple of lessons 
And that is it is important that whenever such uh 
project is on to have a committee of people with of course one
convener or whatever to monitor the progress of the project
So that if for any reason some one member is not able to
 come the other members can continue the course and in this way I hope
 that what happened in you know when Professor Shastri who as you were
very rightly said has been the guiding light and in fact he is the one
who approached us the British Council 
And I think the Board is very fortunate in having a person of
Professor Shastri's experience knowledge and qualification
to be the convener because he is so well versed in E L T 
He has had lots of experience 
So he was able to pitch everything at the right level 
Uh ask me for what kind of suitable help I could extend
 uh he I know put in a lot of effort 
I think too much efforts which uh took its toll and 
and I I also would now think that it is unfair that all the stress
should be only on one individual so that we 
 That's what Kadepurkar said 
Sir again it will be one individual 
I would suggest that if we have atleast a member of a
committee of three or four members 
Because even Harsh might at some points say okay now I have my 
son's exams or my something I cannot come 
So I think it is better to have a committee and not then again
pressurise Harsh uh as much 
So it will and all sudden done three or four heads
together is better than one and also the stress which is on one
person will not be there 
So I would strongly recommend that for the project you
form a committee and let that committee uh work together
So that if one or two people cannot come atleast the
remaining two continue the thing 
Because this was a big gap
You know I was waiting in the Council office for some
information 
And of course I knew about Professor Shastri's illness
 I we did correspond over New Year when he was he was much better
than stuff like that 
But then we lost out on quite a lot of our you know 
activities here which is in much one can always catch up 
There is no I mean nothing has really gone uh uh array
but I think I would recommend that you formulate a committee 
rather than just keep it on one or two people 
For the teacher training project 
For the whole project not only the teacher training project
For the whole project of division of classes nine ten 
eleven twelve 
We have now come to uh we've finished nine and eleven
We are now at the stage of uh looking for identifying
texts and selection of texts for ten and twelve 
 Looking 
So uh you of course spoke only about the teachers'
 awareness programme 
Am I to assume that you are also expecting uh rightly I hope
uh some uh input into these two text books as were given for the nineth
and the eleventh
Yes we should include
 That's it
I have included
So that is what so it is not only teacher awareness
programmes
I would prefer to look at it as the whole project uh
which is the textbook revision and because the syllabus was already made
we couldn't change the syllabus but we have tried to put in as much
communicative skills as possible within the constraints of the syllabus
 and teacher training and somewhere I also read that you are looking
forward to some kind of evaluation of question paper as well
Yes
It should be part of the whole thing so in a way it is
 it covers everything 
So I I would not just say for the teacher training programme
but for the whole project 
And we depend of course on everybody's views
That is just my suggestion 
And for our looking at past experience I would say that uh
 it will be beneficial to the project 
Do you think the committee to plan or to execute 
Uh plan mainly plan 
Mainly plan 
The committee cannot execute 
Committee cannot uh really take up the whole thing they will
plan for the execution naturally 
The three or four people will then
The work of the committee will be only the policy nature 
Not necessarily only 
It is not necessary only depending on uh the persons own uh
 inclination his own expertise his own willingness 
Like Harsh I'm sure he as a member of the committee would
still like to be actively involved in uh the teacher training programme
 in the execution 
So it is not either or you don't have water tight compartment
It depends like professor Shastri might just be there to give us
overall advice because he has so much experience 
He can tell us what he thinks about it 
So he even he is very actively involved
He might just oversee everything 
So that again is very open ended 
 It's not either or 
But for example if uh uh uh a specialist has to come and
say if two people on the committee are not available for discussions atleast
two other people will be available
