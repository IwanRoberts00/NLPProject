I extend a very 
the English Studies Officer the British Council Division 
""
I am also very 
whom we have been missing for quite sometime 
""
Uh  a
bouquet  and request
honourable Chairman to offer a bouquet to Dr Shastri  who has come after
such a long time 
""
And now that Dr Shastri is back  I
hope 
""
When we want the British Council help 
Shastri's 
""
So with these words  and
well I here request honourable chairman  A few
words 
""
""
It gives me a great pleasure  Dr Badlani
""
""
We were really missing him for the last 
""
Now with the  he
will be with us 
""
With his  British Council
""
text book 
""
And  that the same book
""
""
As I understand this is a 
""
It is  structural approach
""
""
""
Communicative
""
""
Communicative skills 
""
In fact I don't know what is exactly  structural approach and
communications 
""
But  I am
getting to it 
""
Any 
""
But  no change is accepted properly
""
people are made to understand it  in the right direction
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So 
one word 
teachers 
""
We must prepare them 
""
And unless we prepare them to accept this change  unless we
convince them 
very difficult 
""
It is not  this will be true for
whole syllabus  the new syllabus is also
changed 
""
We have included 
""
The Board is thinking  orientation of all teachers
""
""
It may be not 
""
But at least two-three days 
""
And particularly for this English language  we require more
orientation  not
our mother tongue  difficult one
""
""
And as  in
rural areas in particular 
""
""
""
 a
communication skill 
""
Teachers themselves lack in communication 
""
They can only read 
and repeat the same thing 
""
But 
""
So 
skill of 
""
If they speak 
speak something 
""
So  has
envisaged 
""
And for that programme atleast 
British Council 
help 
""
We intend to 
have 
""
Am I correct  ?
""
""
Video cassettes
""
""
Video cassettes 
""
But somehow  that
scheme has also 
""
Nevertheless we have not dropped that  we have modified the
scheme 
""
We will modify it 
""
Instead of having a video cassettes  have audio
cassettes 
""
""
""
And  uh I think sixty percent work of the audio cassettes has
been already completed 
""
Even if fifty percent has to be completed  we will complete it
""
""
And 
efforts 
per school  to listen
""
""
And if they listen correct English 
""
For that also we may  State
Board and other voluntary organisations to help us 
""
Secondly  master
trainers course 
""
Nearly there are 
""
If we take  have to
train  in
English 
""
To train 
""
""
For that also  resource
persons 
""
To train the resource person  some master
trainers  have to have
the help of  teachers what you call them
""
""
For you also Madam  request your organisation to have
""
""
We will also request  to
extend their help 
""
Because if we can  good master trainers
""
there can be 
""
If master trainers are not good  the resource persons will not
be good 
""
And if resource persons are not good  very
less will be percolated to the teachers themselves 
""
Uh in that way  straight way from the
""
""
We will have master trainers from there only 
""
So that is also one request 
""
And these master trainers or these workshops  we'll
 teachers handbook or teachers
guide 
""
Atleast then 
""
In the school they will have nothing 
""
In 
what you call that 
villages they hardly get any 
""
So  of particular subject
""
""
So one good  will definitely
help them 
""
I will request for them as for Dr Shastri  get an
assistance 
""
I think 
""
I  to
extend their  and
make this project a successful 
""
If 
 not spell out each
and everything 
""
Uh they have still some scope for the discussion otherwise 
laughter 
""
What will be the 
""
Thank you very much 
""
Now 
""
We have regained our 
""
He is our 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We were really missing him for last  nearly six seven
months 
""
Now he is here  trouble him
much 
""
""
Sure 
""
""
He must  and work only when he enjoys
it 
""
You must work as long as you enjoy it  you
should not 
""
""
""
""
""
With these words I conclude my opening  we'll
""
""
Thank you very much 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
At first I like to thank you all very much for giving me such
a warm welcome 
""
And uh  professionally I have been
English Studies Officer of the British Council 
""
I have been extremely pleased with the work that the Maharashtra
Board  with whatever little support we
have been able to extend through 
""
When I compare it to this  new project in the
Central Board of Secondary Education 
""
I find that uh  tenth
of the facilities  because they have been
funded by another agency the O B A 
""
Ah but nevertheless with whatever limited funds we have had at the
Council in Bombay I have kept Maharashtra Board my top most priority  in
my budgeting 
""
""
Thank you
""
""
And uh 
""
I am going to now put in a request  you know the other
uh  may be more
than one specialist 
""
So far we have only been managing to get one specialist  and
uh for her also it has not been very easy to be working on  three or four
different books 
""
And now with the teaching training uh  I think we
will definitely need more than one person 
""
So uh  reiterate the fact that I
am going to  continue my support as much as I can for the Board
""
And  the
books have actually been produced and are supposed to be out from the press
in May 
""
Ah in this context could I make a request of support  uh since
our funding also is very strictly evaluated and monitored  it would be
very helpful for me if I have I am given  even if it is the rough draft
of the book 
""
So that I can say okay this we have produced 
""
This is the output of our input 
""
And now  for the further output we need this much input
""
It will strengthen my  uh case where my asking for fund is
concerned 
""
Because here I can show concrete evidence 
""
It is no good saying that the thing is taking place you know 
it's 
""
So uh  and why I am asking it now and not when the final
printout is out because  in
April or May 
""
So  that I would
like to show  of whatever input we have made
so far 
""
Uhm  what I want to
at this stage because we  a lot of points will come up in
the discussion 
""
Uhm 
uh we have learnt 
""
And that is 
project is on  with of course one
convener or whatever  project
""
""
So that if for any reason  one member is not able to
 and in this way I hope
 you know when Professor Shastri who as you were
very rightly said has been the guiding light  and in fact he is the one
who approached us 
""
And  I think the Board is very fortunate in having a person of
Professor  and qualification
to be the convener 
""
He has had lots of experience 
""
So he was able to pitch everything at the right level 
""
Uh ask  suitable help I could extend
""
""
I think too much efforts 
and I I also would  all the stress
should be only on one individual 
""
""
""
""
""
Sir again it will be one individual 
""
I would suggest that if we have atleast a member of  a
committee of three or four members 
""
Because even Harsh might at some points say okay now I have my 
son's 
""
So I think it is better to have a committee  and not then again
pressurise Harsh 
""
So it will and  three or four heads
together  which is on one
person will not be there 
""
So I would strongly recommend  you
form a committee  uh work together
""
So that  atleast the
remaining two continue the thing 
""
Because this was a big gap
""
You know I was waiting in the Council office  for some
information 
""
And of course I knew about Professor  illness
 he was much better
than stuff like that 
""
But then we lost out on 
activities here 
""
There is no  uh uh array
but 
rather than just keep it on one or two people 
""
""
For the teacher training project 
""
""
For the whole project not only the teacher training project
""
""
For the whole project of division of classes 
eleven 
""
We have now come to  finished nine and eleven
""
""
We are now at the stage of uh  for identifying
texts and selection of texts for ten and twelve 
""
""
""
""
""
So uh  teachers'
""
""
Am I to assume that you are also expecting uh  rightly I hope
uh  some uh input into these two text books as were given for the nineth
and the eleventh
""
""
Yes we should include
""
""
 it
""
""
I have included
""
""
So that is what so it is not only teacher awareness
programmes
""
I would  uh
which is the textbook revision  and because the syllabus was already made
we couldn't change the syllabus but we have tried to put in as much
communicative skills as possible within  the constraints of the syllabus
 you are looking
forward to  of question paper as well
""
""
Yes
""
""
It should be part of the whole thing so in a way  it is
""
""
So I I would  not just say for the teacher training programme
but for the whole project 
""
And we depend of course on  views
""
That is just my suggestion 
""
And for our looking at past experience  I would say that uh
""
""
""
Do you think the committee to plan 
""
""
Uh 
""
Mainly plan 
""
The committee cannot execute 
""
Committee cannot uh really take up the whole thing  they will
plan for the execution naturally 
""
The three or four people will then
""
""
The work of the committee will be only the policy nature 
""
""
Not necessarily 
""
It is not necessary only depending on  uh the persons own uh
""
""
Like Harsh  sure he as a member of the committee would
still like to be actively involved  in uh the teacher training programme
""
""
So it is not either or  you don't have water tight compartment
""
""
It depends like professor Shastri might just be there to give us
overall advice 
""
He can tell us what he thinks about it 
""
So he even he is very actively involved
""
He might just oversee everything 
""
So that again is very open ended 
""
""
""
But for example if  and
say if two people on the committee are not available for discussions atleast
two other people will be available
