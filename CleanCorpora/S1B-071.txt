one word 
teachers

We must prepare them 
""
""

""
""
It is not  this will be true for
""
""
""
""
""
The Board is thinking  orientation of all teachers
""
""
It may be not 
""
""
""
And particularly for this English language  we require more
""
our mother tongue  difficult one
""
""
And as  in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

For you also Madam  request your organisation to have
""
""
We will also request  to
""

""
""
I think 
""
""
extend their  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
laughter 
""
What will be the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
months 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
With these words I conclude my opening  we'll
""
""
Thank you very much 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  professionally I have been
""
""
I have been extremely pleased with the work that the Maharashtra
""
have been able to extend through 
""
When I compare it to this  new project in the
Central Board of Secondary Education 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Thank you
""
""
""
""
I am going to now put in a request  you know the other
uh  may be more
""
""
So far we have only been managing to get one specialist  and
""
""
""
And now with the teaching training uh  I think we
""
""
So uh  reiterate the fact that I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And now  for the further output we need this much input
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
printout is out because  in
""
""
""
""
so far 
""
""
at this stage because we  a lot of points will come up in
""
""
""
uh we have learnt 
""
And that is 
""
convener or whatever  project
""
""
""
 and in this way I hope
""
very rightly said has been the guiding light  and in fact he is the one
""
""
And  I think the Board is very fortunate in having a person of
""
to be the convener 
""
He has had lots of experience 
""
So he was able to pitch everything at the right level 
""
Uh ask  suitable help I could extend
""
""
I think too much efforts 
and I I also would  all the stress
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir again it will be one individual 
""
""
""
""
Because even Harsh might at some points say okay now I have my 
""
""
""
pressurise Harsh 
""
So it will and  three or four heads
""
person will not be there 
""
So I would strongly recommend  you
form a committee  uh work together
""
So that  atleast the
""
""
Because this was a big gap
""
You know I was waiting in the Council office  for some
""
""
And of course I knew about Professor  illness
""
than stuff like that 
""
""
""
""
""
but 
""
""
""
""
""
""
For the whole project not only the teacher training project
""
""
For the whole project of division of classes 
""
""
We have now come to  finished nine and eleven
""
""
We are now at the stage of uh  for identifying
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh  some uh input into these two text books as were given for the nineth
""
""
""
Yes we should include
""
""
 it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
communicative skills as possible within  the constraints of the syllabus
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is just my suggestion 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is not necessary only depending on  uh the persons own uh
""
""
Like Harsh  sure he as a member of the committee would
still like to be actively involved  in uh the teacher training programme
""
""
""
""
""
It depends like professor Shastri might just be there to give us
overall advice 
""
""
""
""
""
He might just oversee everything 
""
""
""
""
""
But for example if  and
""
