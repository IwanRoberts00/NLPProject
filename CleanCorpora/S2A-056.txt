Hello 
""
But cooking is not such a minor job as some people make it out to be
""
""
Take for example 
""
If you don't know how to do it properly 
""
Yuk  then you must
know some basic facts about eggs 
""
Remember what you learnt at school  ?
""
Just  inside this shell there is a membrane called the outer
shell membrane 
""
And  there
is an air space  and the inner
shell membrane 
""
Now 
""
And if you heat it  the air space expands rapidly
""
""
Since the volume is uh restricted by the shell  the shell cracks
""
""
And this 
""
Now  then
the air inside the air space expands slowly 
""
The outer shell membrane is made up of 
protein  and the air can escape
out of the membrane 
""
The shell 
""
The air can escape through these pores 
""
Let me demonstrate 
""
Notice  than
is needed 
""
If there is too much of water  then the convection current can
take the egg up and down 
""
That can also lead to the cracking of the shell 
""
Now 
""
The problem with this method is  that it takes a very long time
to have a hard boiled egg 
""
Now  I would
definitely get late 
""
So I have learnt a simple trick 
""
First  I determine the approximate position of the air space
inside the egg 
""
Then 
just on top of the air space 
""
Now 
""
The natural pores of the egg  are too tiny compared to the hole
that I have made  and all the air can escape through that hole
""
The result  when I feel it
""
""
Notice the difference in the shape of these two eggs 
""
The flatness of the egg where there was an air space  is not
present in this one 
""
Aesthetically more pleasing isn't it  ?
""
So there is no point in looking at the beauty of these eggs 
unless we can eat them 
""
And sometimes 
because of the smell 
""
It reminds you of the chemistry laboratory  which keeps
apparatus and the horrible smell of hydrogen sulphide 
""
Usually  a rotten egg which smell of hydrogen sulphide
""
But 
even a fresh egg can smell of hydrogen sulphide 
""
To understand this phenomenon  we must look into the contents
""
""
The egg white is not actually white  in colour until you boil or
cook it 
""
It is transparent  and consists mainly of a globular protein
called albumin 
""
Protein as we know it 
""
Among the twenty odd amino acids which are normally found in
protein 
cystine 
""
When the long chain of amino-acids  folds on itself to form the
globular tertiary structure  hydrogen bond and a few S S
bonds 
""
When we heat the albumin 
""
The protein settles out and undergoes what is known as denaturation
""
""
Some of the S S bonds are also broken down  and ultimately form
""
""
The denatured protein  into each other
""
""
This is how the albumin becomes white and opaque 
""
The tendency of the liberated H  is to move
towards cooler areas  that is towards the center of the egg where it comes
into contact with the yolk  and reacts with the metallic irons of the yolk
to form a green coloured salt 
""
Thus the yolk gets a coat of green 
""
Personally I don't like the egg to smell  nor do I like it to be
green 
""
So  both these
problems 
""
As soon as the egg is boiled  take it out of hot water and put
it into cold water 
""
And as I told you before  2
""
""
So  it
will move out of the egg 
""
So there will be no bad smell 
""
The problems arise  only when you leave the egg in hot water
""
""
Now we come to the last problem of dealing with hard boiled egg 
""
The difficulty in 
""
Sometimes along with the egg shell the egg white also seems to come
out 
""
Actually this does not happen 
""
Usually it comes up very easily 
""
This only happens if you have a fresh egg 
""
The solution to this problem is simple 
""
Do not hard boil a fresh egg 
""
The intermolecular forces between the shell membrane and the egg
white 
""
Within two three days of laying  these bonds become weaker
""
So if you want to have a hard boiled egg choose an older egg 
""
""
But if you want a fried egg  better to go in for
fresh egg 
""
The intermolecular forces are stronger in fresh eggs 
""
So you get a more compact looking fried egg 
""
And if you use an older egg  it tends to thin out into the pan
and run  turning
it 
""
So boil 
""
I suppose we talked about fried egg the boiled egg  the
scrambled egg and the list is more than completed if we add omelette to it
""
""
The delicacy or the softness of an omelette  may depend on how
much of froth you manage to make when beating it 
""
The method of beating the egg  may
contribute to the frothiness 
""
But more important  beating
the egg 
""
I have cleaned this vessel very well  with soapened water to
remove all the grease from it 
""
And in another vessel  oil
""
""
Now  I take two egg from the same batch of eggs that I received
 meaning that the age of both the
eggs is the same 
""
Now watch 
""
Notice there is not too much of froth in this vessel  with the
coat of oil in it 
""
Why  ?
""
In the physics classes at school  we have learnt about surface
tension 
""
Bubbles are more easily formed in water  if we add soap to it
""
""
If we apply this principle of surface tension to this phenomenon
""
""
Oil  increases the surface tension
""
So 
before you beat the egg 
""
In this programme we have eaten boiled eggs fried eggs scrambled
eggs eggs made into an omelette 
""
But I am sure we will have indigestion  if we have any more of
this stuff 
""
So  let me conclude this programme by merely mentioning the
mouth watering delicacies in which eggs are used 
""
Caramel custard  meonade and a lot of
these delicious stuff 
""
And  a song in the praise of egg would include
the voices  some of us who are
vegetarian 
""
But you wouldn't mind eating a so called 
""
A vegetarian egg is nothing else than unfertilised egg 
""
There is of course no difference in taste between a fertilised egg
and an unfertilised egg

Hi Rajan 
""
""
Hi 
""
""
How are you ?
""
""
Fine 
""
""
 again you have got pain in your
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Lal Sahab this is my brother Rajan 
""
""
Hello 
""
""
Hello nice meeting you 
""
""
 I think because of prolonged driving
throughout the day he is driving around 
""
Do you think you have any simple exercises for people who do a lot
of driving  ?
""
""
Yeah sure 
""
""
Could you please show us some ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Here itself  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Oh very nice  that will be very nice
""
""
When you have to drive uh  you know long distances perhaps
you could do some exercises 
""
""
Oh that would be very nice 
""
""
If it pain or pressure  okay
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Some are very simple  which I will show you here unless
you perhaps 
""
One is this  breathing
in you lift your body up  as high as
you 
""
Here 
""
The other exercise which you can do is put your hands here 
right hand  and then turn your head to the other side
""
""
Breath in 
""
Now breath in 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
breath out 
""
Now another exercise what you can do is  rotate your shoulder
breathing in out 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
Breath in up 
""
Then forward 
""
I hope this much you can manage 
""
""
Yes I can 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah some are these  and then there are plenty of
exercises 
""
""
Since the space is limited out here  I am sure you can't
do all the excersises here 
""
""
Naturally
""
""
Why don't we go  and demonstrate some excercises for
better endurance  ?
""
""
Sure
""
""
Come 
""
""
Bye bye 
""
""
All  shoulder
shrouds or  can take off stress from your
head and shoulders  especially after
prolonged driving 
""
Simply breath in as you take your shoulder up  and breath out
as you bring them down 
""
prolong driving affects your blood circulation very badly 
""
These simple spinal twist up here  accelerate blood supply to
the whole system 
""
This is 
""
Very useful  and
strain from your entire back  it also can take off extra
flesh from your abdomen 
""
Breathing in take your leg to the side 
""
You can repeat  in the first
two weeks 
""
This  a natural
massage to your entire system 
""
You can stay there 
""
Press it very naturally 
""
Don't strain yourself too much 
""
You see during prolonged sitting and driving or travelling 
your all the body joints almost are frozen  and
the feet come under a heavy attack 
""
Circulation is affected very badly 
""
So these simple movements can relieve  the pressure from your
legs and the knees 
""
Also if you have knee pain often or the knees are stiff  even
in a day to day life  these simple movements further knees and the legs
can help you 
""
This is called  the simple spinal
twist 
ardhmasendra asan 
""
It gives a lateral movement to the entire spinal column 
""
This can help you  one word
""
""
This is one of the constituent of 
""
yogasan 
and shoulders 
""
After having done all these  and
exercises
