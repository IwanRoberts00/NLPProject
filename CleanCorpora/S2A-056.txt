Hello 
""
""
""
""
Take for example 
""
""
""
""
know some basic facts about eggs 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if you heat it  the air space expands rapidly
""
""
Since the volume is uh restricted by the shell  the shell cracks
""
""
And this 
""
Now  then
""
""
The outer shell membrane is made up of 
""
""
""
""
""
The air can escape through these pores 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The problem with this method is  that it takes a very long time
""
""
Now  I would
definitely get late 
""
So I have learnt a simple trick 
""
First  I determine the approximate position of the air space
""
""
Then 
just on top of the air space 
""
Now 
""
""
that I have made  and all the air can escape through that hole
""
The result  when I feel it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So there is no point in looking at the beauty of these eggs 
""
""
And sometimes 
because of the smell 
""
It reminds you of the chemistry laboratory  which keeps
""
""
Usually  a rotten egg which smell of hydrogen sulphide
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
called albumin 
""
""
""
Among the twenty odd amino acids which are normally found in
protein 
""
""
When the long chain of amino-acids  folds on itself to form the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The denatured protein  into each other
""
""
""
""
""
towards cooler areas  that is towards the center of the egg where it comes
""
""
""
""
""
Personally I don't like the egg to smell  nor do I like it to be
""
""
""
problems 
""
As soon as the egg is boiled  take it out of hot water and put
it into cold water 
""
And as I told you before  2
""
""
""
will move out of the egg 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The difficulty in 
""
Sometimes along with the egg shell the egg white also seems to come
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The solution to this problem is simple 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So if you want to have a hard boiled egg choose an older egg 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if you use an older egg  it tends to thin out into the pan
""
""
""
""
""
I suppose we talked about fried egg the boiled egg  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I have cleaned this vessel very well  with soapened water to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Notice there is not too much of froth in this vessel  with the
""
""
""
""
In the physics classes at school  we have learnt about surface
""
""
Bubbles are more easily formed in water  if we add soap to it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
before you beat the egg 
""
In this programme we have eaten boiled eggs fried eggs scrambled
""
""
""
""
""
So  let me conclude this programme by merely mentioning the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
vegetarian 
""
But you wouldn't mind eating a so called 
""
A vegetarian egg is nothing else than unfertilised egg 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Fine 
""
""
 again you have got pain in your
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
throughout the day he is driving around 
""
Do you think you have any simple exercises for people who do a lot
of driving  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
Don't strain yourself too much 
""
""
""
the feet come under a heavy attack 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in a day to day life  these simple movements further knees and the legs
can help you 
""
""
""
""
""
It gives a lateral movement to the entire spinal column 
""
This can help you  one word

""
This is one of the constituent of
