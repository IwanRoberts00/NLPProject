Hello I am Tabussum Khan and I love cooking 
But cooking is not such a minor job as some people make it out to be
Take for example the simple act of boiling an egg 
If you don't know how to do it properly you can make a mess 
Yuk if you want to avoid a mess like this then you must
know some basic facts about eggs 
Remember what you learnt at school ?
Just inside this shell there is a membrane called the outer
shell membrane 
And at one end of the egg usually the broader end there
is an air space enclosed by the outer shell membrane and the inner
shell membrane 
Now when you heat an egg this air space expands 
And if you heat it rapidly the air space expands rapidly
Since the volume is uh restricted by the shell the shell cracks
 and the contents leak out 
And this is the result 
Now if you heat the egg slowly using a low flame then
the air inside the air space expands slowly 
The outer shell membrane is made up of methastheracin 
protein the kind which you find in our skins and the air can escape
out of the membrane towards the shell 
The shell is calcium carbonate and it has very fine pores 
The air can escape through these pores outside 
Let me demonstrate demonstrates 
Notice may I am not taking too much of water than
is needed to immerse the egg 
If there is too much of water then the convection current can
take the egg up and down hitting it against the sides of the vessel 
That can also lead to the cracking of the shell 
Now a slow flame and a long wait music 
The problem with this method is that it takes a very long time
to have a hard boiled egg music 
Now if I want to go to college in the morning I would
definitely get late 
So I have learnt a simple trick music 
First I determine the approximate position of the air space
inside the egg 
Then using a sharp pin I make a tiny hole in the shell 
just on top of the air space 
Now I can get a hard boiled egg very fast music 
The natural pores of the egg are too tiny compared to the hole
that I have made and all the air can escape through that hole
The result is a perfectly egg shaped egg when I feel it
 music 
Notice the difference in the shape of these two eggs 
The flatness of the egg where there was an air space is not
present in this one 
Aesthetically more pleasing isn't it ?
So there is no point in looking at the beauty of these eggs 
unless we can eat them 
And sometimes I find it very difficult to eat an egg 
because of the smell 
It reminds you of the chemistry laboratory which keeps
apparatus and the horrible smell of hydrogen sulphide 
Usually it's a rotten egg which smell of hydrogen sulphide
But if after boiling it if you leave the egg in hot water 
even a fresh egg can smell of hydrogen sulphide 
To understand this phenomenon we must look into the contents
 of the egg white music 
The egg white is not actually white in colour until you boil or
cook it 
It is transparent and consists mainly of a globular protein
called albumin 
Protein as we know it is a long chain of amino-acids 
Among the twenty odd amino acids which are normally found in
protein there are three which have sulphur in them cystin 
cystine and methionine 
When the long chain of amino-acids folds on itself to form the
globular tertiary structure quite a few hydrogen bond and a few S S
bonds help to stabilize the structure 
When we heat the albumin these bonds are broken 
The protein settles out and undergoes what is known as denaturation
Some of the S S bonds are also broken down and ultimately form
 H 2 S which gives you that typical smell 
The denatured protein then cross to into each other
 and cogulate 
This is how the albumin becomes white and opaque 
The tendency of the liberated H 2 S is to move
towards cooler areas that is towards the center of the egg where it comes
into contact with the yolk and reacts with the metallic irons of the yolk
to form a green coloured salt 
Thus the yolk gets a coat of green 
Personally I don't like the egg to smell nor do I like it to be
green 
So I'll tell you a simple trick to avoid both these
problems music 
As soon as the egg is boiled take it out of hot water and put
it into cold water 
And as I told you before the tendency of the liberated H 2
 S is to diffuse towards cooler areas 
So now instead of moving towards the center of the egg it
will move out of the egg 
So there will be no bad smell and no green coloured yolk 
The problems arise only when you leave the egg in hot water
Now we come to the last problem of dealing with hard boiled egg 
The difficulty in peeling 
Sometimes along with the egg shell the egg white also seems to come
out 
Actually this does not happen with all the eggs 
Usually it comes up very easily 
This only happens if you have a fresh egg 
The solution to this problem is simple 
Do not hard boil a fresh egg 
The intermolecular forces between the shell membrane and the egg
white are stronger in fresh egg 
Within two three days of laying these bonds become weaker
So if you want to have a hard boiled egg choose an older egg 
 music 
But if you want a fried egg it's better to go in for
fresh egg 
The intermolecular forces are stronger in fresh eggs 
So you get a more compact looking fried egg 
And if you use an older egg it tends to thin out into the pan
and run and it becomes difficult to handle when you are turning
it 
So boil or scramble an older egg 
I suppose we talked about fried egg the boiled egg the
scrambled egg and the list is more than completed if we add omelette to it
 music 
The delicacy or the softness of an omelette may depend on how
much of froth you manage to make when beating it 
The method of beating the egg or the technology may
contribute to the frothiness 
But more important is that vessel in which you are beating
the egg 
I have cleaned this vessel very well with soapened water to
remove all the grease from it 
And in another vessel I apply a light coat of oil
Now I take two egg from the same batch of eggs that I received
 from the poultry farm this morning meaning that the age of both the
eggs is the same 
Now watch beating the egg 
Notice there is not too much of froth in this vessel with the
coat of oil in it whereas in this one there is a lot of froth 
Why ?
In the physics classes at school we have learnt about surface
tension 
Bubbles are more easily formed in water if we add soap to it
 because soap produces the surface tension of water 
If we apply this principle of surface tension to this phenomenon
 you have solved another practical problem in your kitchen 
Oil increases the surface tension
So it is really necessary to clean the vessel thoroughly 
before you beat the egg that is if you want a really soft omelette 
In this programme we have eaten boiled eggs fried eggs scrambled
eggs eggs made into an omelette 
But I am sure we will have indigestion if we have any more of
this stuff 
So let me conclude this programme by merely mentioning the
mouth watering delicacies in which eggs are used 
Caramel custard pasteries cake meonade and a lot of
these delicious stuff 
And I'm sure a song in the praise of egg would include
the voices to the from some of us who are
vegetarian 
But you wouldn't mind eating a so called vegetarian egg 
A vegetarian egg is nothing else than unfertilised egg 
There is of course no difference in taste between a fertilised egg
and an unfertilised egg music 
Hi Rajan 
Hi 
How are you ?
Fine 
 Kya hua again you have got pain in your
 yeah shoulder base and neck 
 Yeah 
Yeah it's paining 
Lal Sahab this is my brother Rajan

Yeah some are these and then there are plenty of
exercises 
Since the space is limited out here I am sure you can't
do all the excersises here 
Naturally
Why don't we go and demonstrate some excercises for
better endurance ?
Sure
Come 
Bye bye 
All skanda chalan can shoulder
shrouds or skanda chalan can take off stress from your
head and shoulders which come under heavy attack especially after
prolonged driving 
Simply breath in as you take your shoulder up and breath out
as you bring them down 
prolong driving affects your blood circulation very badly 
These simple spinal twist up here accelerate blood supply to
the whole system making you refreshed again 
This is suptahastapadangosth asan 
Very useful asan for relieving stress and
strain from your entire back besides it also can take off extra
flesh from your abdomen 
Breathing in take your leg to the side out come back 
You can repeat between seven and ten times in the first
two weeks 
This pawammukta asan is giving a natural
massage to your entire system 
You can stay there for as long as you feel comfortable 
Press it very naturally 
Don't strain yourself too much 
You see during prolonged sitting and driving or travelling 
your all the body joints almost are frozen specially your knees and
the feet come under a heavy attack 
Circulation is affected very badly 
So these simple movements can relieve the pressure from your
legs and the knees 
Also if you have knee pain often or the knees are stiff even
in a day to day life these simple movements further knees and the legs
can help you come out of that uh situation 
This is called vakra asan the simple spinal
twist or the first position or preparatory exercise for 
ardhmasendra asan 
It gives a lateral movement to the entire spinal column 
This can help you alleviate back ache and one word
 etcetera 
This is one of the constituent of surya namaskar 
 called ashwa sanchalak one of the best 
yogasan to relieve stress from your back head and neck 
and shoulders 
After having done all these yogasan and
exercises you must relax in this position in Hindi
