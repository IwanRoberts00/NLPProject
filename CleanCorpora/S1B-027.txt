<I>
There are ten days to go and then we will witness the
elections in Punjab which perhaps are going to be the most difficult 
ever held in this country 
 It's not known how many people will or will feel
free to come and participate in them 
Uh what kind of uh state of disturbance there might or
might not be 
And therefore what kind of value should one attach to this
exercise ?
What does it hold in in the in terms of
the future of Punjab ?
These are some of the questions which uh I'm going to
explore this evening with a group of very experienced observers of the
scene 
On my immediate left is Mr Prem Bhatia chief editor of the
 Tribune at on time 
Khuswant Singh probably the best known non-political
Punjabi I would say laughter 
And Mr Girilal Jain formerly chief editor of the 
 Times of India 
I know it's a difficult question to answer 
We can only guess 
But let me invite your best guess estimate 
On first of all the very crucial question do you think that uh 
it will be an election which will hold meaning in the sense that a
substantial proportion of people will come forward to participate in them
 ?
And I mean I think thereafter it would be necessary for us to
look into the question what is it that can be done between now and
the day of polling which would possibly improves the chances of a
higher voter turn-out ?
Prem would you like to have the first shot at it ?
Well the reaction public reaction at the moment 
and that is fairly good criterion of uh making an assessment
The public reaction is a mixture of despair cynicism 
and some hope 
I I I'll suggest let's go into the reasons
later but give your short answers first put your uh what shall
you say your guess on the table 
When we'll explore it the guess about the future
 about the participation level Punjab has been known for a very high
percentage of voting in the past 
Never less than sixty percent 
Yeah sixty-seven 
Never less than sixty at the worst of times
 Ah 
Well I would be a great optimistic if I would say sixty
percent are going to turn-out 
My own guess would be closer to thirty 
And I think we'll be lucky if we get thirty percent 
Ah ha 
Well my ques answer won't
be as brief because I've just been looking at the 
 I'll I give you a second by to the 
one word later
 To record 
Yeah
 What's your pretty guess
I you know it's not as easy as that
I I as Prem said that uh Punjab has a uh a very good record
of large turn-out
Yes 
Uh the lowest has been sixty seventy percent when a
boycott has been called in the past 
Uh this time I'm not sure the boycott is being called
again 
But I I the general impression as I've seen is that if
 the polling is above sixty percent it will be regarded as a success
If it is between forty to fifty percent it's a
draw 
And if it is under forty percent then the boycotters will have
that uh
 Would you would you have a little
range in mind
 Do you do you think how far 
 how far up and how far down it should be ?
I I think you be don't wish to make one or two
words 
 Would not like to make a guess 
Giri would you speak what you make out
If it is one-third uhm if it is around
thirty-five percent yes I would regard it as a success 
 even 
 Uhm 
 Yes 
 Would you would you expect thirty-five percent
 ?
Do you think it will be ?
I don't think it will be 
It would be closer to thirty than to thirty-five in my opinion
Perhaps very precise guess somewhere between thirty and
thirty-five is really making it very precise 
I want to address uh one question to you in this very question
our level of participation
You know the Assam election where the percentage of voter
turn-out much lower four percent yeah to be exact
 Much lower 
 Yeah 
People have been saying uh what is the use of an election
like that 
Whatever the voter turn-out actually may happen to be
 I think it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that this
voter turn-out would have occured inspite of the extensive fear of
violence 
In Assam there was no such fear at all 
A J P had not held out any threat 
But people were not inclined to vote 
They were not with the election and therefore the four percent
voter turn- out was a clear indication of what their political opinion
was 
In the present case I would say that the low turn-out or not in my
view be regarded as a rejection of the political process because
there would be an element in it of fear of voting rather than a
 an aversion to vote 
Would you agree on that assessment of the political weight of
whatever the figure might turn-out to be
I think it's suppose fear of voting 
They don't want to be killed maimed for life 
And the other things is I think there is I said earlier a
touch of cynicism 
What will happen people say now supposing an elec
 an election takes place 
Uh attempts were made to form a government 
Where is it going to lead us ?
What would the government pe people
 think in those terms 
And therefore as I said this element of despair the voter 
potential voter is not sure whether this election is going to lead
anywhere 
That is the dominant mood today
Yeah but uh votes have not on the other hand become
 if people were to free to vote 
Vote for that itself become a reason 
While they would go out to vote to make sure that it does lead
somewhere that it doesn't lead the electoral process and therefore
the future of Punjab hanging 
If on the other hand it were cynicism without the
enforcement of a boycott by fear then it would be a different picture
Kushwant ?
Well I think there is one thing which complicates the
situation
The Punjab in which I think you must bear in mind because
the problem of the Punjab in very roughly put is the problem of
the Sikhs 
And I think it's more important to bear in mind what
proportion of Sikh electorate go to the poll 
 What voters go 
And the the may simple way of
looking at it is the urban and the rural voting for the Sikh is
largely rural the Hindu is largely urban
Uh and the there is no doubt that in cities Ludhiana
 Jalandhar Amritsar there is likely to be larger turn- out 
because the Hindu presence is there much larger 
Than probably we uh smaller turn-out in the rural 
 ar areas 
 Rural areas 
And uh we should watch and analyse that mood 
to find out whether there is any substance whether the so called
grievances of the Sikhs which the Akali's have
been talking about the terrorist have been talking about 
whether they've really gone down to the people themselves 
 One or two word uh since you are willing to speculate
 I am glad you do 
Would you say that the greater disincentive to voter
participation among the Sikhs would you say that the greater
disincentive is going to be cynicism disinterest or fear 
Well I expect it would be a combination of the three and I
think the the situation will vary from area to area 
Uh you take the three old traditional divisions of the Punjab
 Maza Malwa and Doab
The largest group is in Malwa where I think the turn-out will
be there
All because one or two words it's a
prosperous area as a green belt uh area
And we already had people like uh Amandar Singh being elected
 One or two words 
Yeah yeah 
And of course where the terrorist are more active the
Maza Gu Gurdaspur Amritsar 
Kapurthala in the Doab area uh there the turn-out will inevitably be
less
Because the fear of the terrorist is much more there 
Giri uh since you came down to a very precise prediction
 let's assume for the sake of argument that something like
thirty percent plus voter turn-out takes place 
Taking into account that the voter turn-out is only thirty percent
 taking into account if Khuswant's fear turn-out fears turn out
to be true that the voter turn out among the Sikhs may be lower and only
the total may be thirty percent 
What you think should be the attitude of uh the rest of the
country or government of India you might say ?
To a government that would be formed as a result of that
election would you regard it as a legitimate government ?
You see this is this election 
 is an act of desperation
Uhm 
The government of India has decided to go in for elections
 because nothing else has worked 
Yes 
The government of India knows that the law under
situation is far from what it should be for elections to be held
properly 
We all know it 
It is also obvious that the threat is much more acute in
 dispersed rural areas than in large cities 
Yeah 
 It's much easier to protect people in cities
than in rural areas 
So the fear element will be much stronger in the countryside
 than in the larger urban centres 
The Hindu-Sikh problem is a fact which can not be
disregarded 
And if the Sikh turn out I mean Sikhs are concentrated in the
rural areas and if their turn-out is smaller than in the cities 
than to that election to that extent the election result will be 
not so helpful 
But there is no option now
There is no option and 
And the government that result from it should be
regarded as legitimate 
Alright
Only I would add one thing that if the 
that that government must be very sensitive to the reality of
the situation in Punjab 
Sure 
I I want to suggest one yardstick for guessing 
how much of the voter abstention is on account of fear ?
And how much on account of aversion ?
The very fact that there are threats being held out that
 if you vote we'll kill you indicates that
in the minds of those who are holding out the threats there is a
recognition that in the absence of the threat people will vote 
That it is not so if if they were convinced that people are so
cynical that they will not go to vote any how it would not be
necessary to prevent them with threats
And I go back to the example of the A J P in Assam 
A J P held out no such threat of the kind 
 It's position was known that we do not like these
elections they are not fair elections and we will boycott them 
There after they left it to the judgement of the people because
they knew that the people were with them 
Is it not the case than Prem that the element of fear is the
predominant deterrent and not either cynisism or uncertainity about
what the elections will produce 
Uh I don't know whether if one can measure it in precise
terms 
But uh I would I would like to say
that another element which comes from uh the present attitude that
belong to the present attitude is one of sulk 
Uhm
Now I don't think that the population at large the Sikhs
 I mean you have put your finger on the pulse of the uh the
temper of the State 
Among the Sikhs even among the Sikhs this sulking element 
is not as large among the masses as among the leaders 
The Sikh population is not sulking 
They are unhappy they are cynical to the extent that they
don't think much is going to come out of it 
But I think down in their hearts they think it's 
worth trying 
They are fed up with the negative state of things 
And uh they don't go into the technicalities of uh 
elections like you I do 
But there is uh heaven's sake get us out of this mess
Yeah 
And if this is the only way alright we would like to vote
There is the element of fear 
But then I think some of them turn back and say well
what than is going to come out of it 
So there are these two conflicts
Uh I
As Pran told at the last election we had the same threats 
 yeah and yet the turn out was over fifty-seven few
words 
 Yeah 
 Yeah I think first of all 
Which last election ?
Both the Parliamentary and the Assembly yeah there
was a large turn-out 
 One or two words 
 Eighty-five eighty-nine both of them
 Eighty-five eighty-nine 
They defied the threats just went to vote 
No no I have
Eighty-nine parliamentary elections uhm and
the uh eighty-five uh uh assembly election
 Uhm 
At eighty-five the voters turn-out 
At eighty-five it isn't but eighty-nine parliamentary elections
 uhm the voter turn-out was sixty to present plus
 Uhm 
I never do
Sixty-two point seven in nineteen eighty-nine you had the
parliamentary in the assembly sixty-seven point five
That was in eighty-five 
 That's right and it's never been 
 really al 
 Are you are you 
 would you would you say that the same kind of
eagerness to vote would surface if there was not the fear of the
gun ?
I somehow think that we are exaggerating the fear of the gun
if they have done voted in the past uhm despite a fear of
the gun 
 Uhm 
A bigger element is a kind of indifference it makes
you know whether if this fellow gets or that fellow gets and we'll
 get nothing out of them 
Uh and I think you have to also if there is a sort of
disillusionment with the government there is probably a bigger
disillusionment with the Akali factions 
Yeah 
And whether the Akali's called
for a boycott or not it doesn't matter 
Uh people are would I have got thoroughly fed up of there
 in infighting and factionalism
And therefore I have been different whether Akali
 this wins or Akali that wins
