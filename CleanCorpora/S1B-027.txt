There are ten days to go  the
elections in Punjab 
ever held in this country 
""
 or will feel
free 
""
Uh what kind of uh  disturbance there might or
might not be 
""
And therefore what kind of value should one attach  to this
exercise  ?
""
What does it hold  terms of
the future of Punjab  ?
""
These are some of the questions which uh  going to
explore this evening with a group of  very experienced observers of the
scene 
""
On my  chief editor of the
""
""
Khuswant Singh  non-political
Punjabi I would say 
""
And Mr Girilal Jain 
""
""
I know 
""
We can only guess 
""
But let me invite your 
""
On first of all the very crucial question do you think that uh 
it will be an election which will hold meaning in the sense that a
substantial proportion of people will come forward  to participate in them
 ?
""
And I mean  I think thereafter it would be necessary for us to
look into the question  and
the day of polling which would possibly  of a
higher voter turn-out  ?
""
Prem would you like to have the first shot at it  ?
""
""
Well the 
and that is  making an assessment
""
""
The public reaction is a mixture of 
and some hope 
""
""
I I  go into the reasons
later but give your  what shall
you say your guess on the table 
""
""
When  the guess about the future
 Punjab has been known for a very high
percentage of voting in the past 
""
Never less than sixty percent 
""
""
Yeah sixty-seven 
""
""
Never less than  at the worst of times
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well I would be a great optimistic if I would say sixty
percent are going to turn-out 
""
My own guess would be closer to thirty 
""
And I think 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
Well my  won't
be as brief because 
""
""
""
one word  later
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
 your pretty guess
""
""
I you know  not as easy as that
""
I I as Prem said that  uh a very good record
of large turn-out
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uh the lowest has been sixty seventy percent  when a
boycott has been called 
""
Uh this time  not sure the boycott is being called
again 
""
But I I  seen is that if
 it will be regarded as a success
""
""
If it is between  a
draw 
""
And if it is under forty percent  then the boycotters will have
that uh
""
""
 have a little
range in mind
""
""
 it should be ?
""
""
I I think you be  one or two
words 
""
""
""
""
""
Giri would you  speak what you make out
""
""
If it is one-third  if it is around
thirty-five percent 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 you would you expect thirty-five percent
 ?
""
Do you think it will be ?
""
""
I don't think it will be 
""
It would be closer to thirty than to thirty-five in my opinion
""
""
Perhaps very precise guess somewhere between thirty and
thirty-five is 
""
I want to address uh one  question to you in this very question
our level of participation
""
You know the Assam election  where the percentage of voter
turn-out  to be exact
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
People have been saying uh  what is the use of an election
like that 
""
""
Whatever the  happen to be
 that this
voter turn-out would have occured  the extensive fear of
violence 
""
In Assam there was no such fear at all 
""
A J P had not held out any threat 
""
But people were not inclined to vote 
""
They were not with the election  and therefore the four percent
voter turn- out  was a clear indication of what their political opinion
was 
""
In the present case I would say that the low turn-out or not in my
view be regarded as  because
there would be an element in it of  a
""
""
Would you agree on that assessment of  the political weight of
whatever the figure might turn-out to be
""
""
I think 
""
They don't want to be killed 
""
And the other things is I think there is  a
touch of cynicism 
""
What will happen people say  elec
""
""
Uh attempts were made to form a government 
""
Where is it going to lead us  ?
""
What would the government  people
""
""
And therefore as I said this element of despair 
potential voter  is not sure whether this election is going to lead
anywhere 
""
That is the dominant mood today
""
""
Yeah but uh  become
""
""
Vote for that itself become a reason 
""
While they would go out to vote to make sure that it does lead
somewhere  and therefore
the future of Punjab hanging 
""
If on the other hand  without the
enforcement of a boycott by fear  picture
""
Kushwant  ?
""
""
Well I think there is one thing which complicates the
situation
""
The Punjab in which  because
the problem of the Punjab  very roughly put is the problem of
the Sikhs 
""
And I think  what
proportion of 
""
""
""
""
""
And  of
looking at it is the  voting for the Sikh is
largely rural  the Hindu is largely urban
""
Uh  cities Ludhiana
""
because the Hindu presence is there much larger 
""
Than probably we uh smaller turn-out in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh 
to find out whether there is any substance whether  the so called
grievances of the Sikhs which the  have
been 
whether 
""
""
 uh since you are willing to speculate
""
""
Would you say that the greater disincentive to  voter
participation  would you say that the greater
disincentive is going to be 
""
""
Well I expect it would be a combination of the three and I
think the 
""
Uh you take the three old traditional  divisions of the Punjab
 Doab
""
The largest group is in Malwa  where I think the turn-out will
be there
""
All because  a
prosperous area as a green belt  uh area
""
And we already had  people like uh Amandar Singh being elected
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
And of course  the
Maza 
Kapurthala in  uh there the turn-out will inevitably be
less
""
Because the fear of the terrorist is much more there 
""
""
Giri uh  since you came down to a very precise prediction
 that something like
thirty percent plus voter turn-out takes place 
""
Taking into account that the voter turn-out is only thirty percent
 fear turn-out fears turn out
to be true  that the voter turn out among the Sikhs may be lower and only
the total may be thirty percent 
""
What you think should be the attitude of uh  the rest of the
country  ?
""
To a government that would be formed  as a result of that
election  ?
""
""
You see 
 is an act of desperation
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
The government of India has decided to go in for elections
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
The government of India knows that  the law under
situation is far from  for elections to be held
properly 
""
We all know it 
""
It is also obvious that  is much more acute in
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 people in cities
than in 
""
So  the fear element will be much stronger in the countryside
""
""
The Hindu-Sikh problem  which can not be
disregarded 
""
And if the Sikh turn out  I mean Sikhs are concentrated in the
rural areas 
than to that election 
not so helpful 
""
But there is no option now
""
""
There is no option and 
""
""
And the government  should be
regarded as legitimate 
""
""
Alright
""
""
Only I would add one thing that 
that that  of
the situation in Punjab 
""
""
Sure 
""
""
I I want to 
how much of the voter abstention is on account of fear  ?
""
And how much on account of aversion  ?
""
The very fact  that
 indicates that
in the minds of those who are holding out the threats  there is a
recognition 
""
That it is not so if if they were convinced  that people are so
cynical  it would not be
necessary to prevent them  with threats
""
And I go back to the example of the A J P in Assam 
""
A J P held out no such threat of the kind 
""
 we do not like these
elections they are not fair elections and we will boycott them 
""
There after they left it to the judgement of the people because
they knew that the people were with them 
""
Is it not the case than Prem  that the element of fear is the
predominant deterrent and not  or uncertainity about
what the elections will produce 
""
""
Uh I don't know whether if one can measure it in precise
terms 
""
But uh  like to say
that  the present attitude that
belong to the present attitude 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Now I don't think that the population at large  the Sikhs
 the
temper of the State 
""
Among the Sikhs 
is not as large 
""
The Sikh population is not sulking 
""
They are unhappy  they are cynical to the extent that they
don't think much is going to come out of it 
""
But I think 
worth trying 
""
They are fed up 
""
And uh 
elections like you I do 
""
But there is uh  sake get us out of this mess
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And if this is the only way alright we would like to vote
""
""
There is the element of fear 
""
But then I think some of them  well
what than is going to come out of it 
""
So there are these two conflicts
""
""
Uh I
""
""
As Pran told at the last election we had the same threats 
 few
words 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Which last election  ?
""
""
Both the Parliamentary and the Assembly yeah  there
was a large turn-out 
""
""
""
""
""
 both of them
""
""
""
""
""
They defied the threats just went to vote 
""
""
No no I have
""
""
Eighty-nine parliamentary elections  and
the uh eighty-five  uh uh assembly election
""
""
""
""
""
At eighty-five the voters turn-out 
""
At eighty-five it isn't but eighty-nine parliamentary elections
 plus
""
""
""
""
""
I never do
""
""
Sixty-two point seven in nineteen eighty-nine you had the
parliamentary  in the assembly sixty-seven point five
""
""
That was in eighty-five 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 the same kind of
eagerness  would surface if there was not the fear of the
gun  ?
""
""
I somehow think that we are exaggerating the fear of the gun
if they have done  despite a fear of
the gun 
""
""
""
""
""
A bigger element is  it makes
you know whether if this fellow gets or that fellow gets  we'll
""
""
Uh and I think  you have to also if there is a sort of
disillusionment with the government  there is probably a bigger
disillusionment with the 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And whether the  called
for a boycott or not it doesn't matter 
""
Uh people are  I have got thoroughly fed up of there
 and factionalism
""
And therefore I have been different  Akali
