There are ten days to go  the
""
""
""
""
free 
""
""
might not be 
""
And therefore what kind of value should one attach  to this
""
""
What does it hold  terms of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Khuswant Singh  non-political
""
""
And Mr Girilal Jain 
""
""
I know 
""
We can only guess 
""
""
""
""
""
substantial proportion of people will come forward  to participate in them
""
""
And I mean  I think thereafter it would be necessary for us to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and that is  making an assessment
""
""
""
and some hope 
""
""
""
later but give your  what shall
you say your guess on the table 
""
""
""
 Punjab has been known for a very high
""
""
Never less than sixty percent 
""
""
Yeah sixty-seven 
""
""
Never less than  at the worst of times
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I think 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
Well my  won't
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I I as Prem said that  uh a very good record
of large turn-out
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 it should be ?
""
""
""
words 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If it is one-third  if it is around
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 you would you expect thirty-five percent
""
""
""
""
""
I don't think it will be 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
turn-out  to be exact
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
People have been saying uh  what is the use of an election
""
""
""
""
""
voter turn-out would have occured  the extensive fear of
""
""
In Assam there was no such fear at all 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In the present case I would say that the low turn-out or not in my
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think 
""
""
""
""
touch of cynicism 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
anywhere 
""
That is the dominant mood today
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
somewhere  and therefore
""
""
""
""
""
Kushwant  ?
""
""
""
situation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
looking at it is the  voting for the Sikh is
""
""
Uh  cities Ludhiana
""
because the Hindu presence is there much larger 
""
Than probably we uh smaller turn-out in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
participation  would you say that the greater
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
prosperous area as a green belt  uh area
""
And we already had  people like uh Amandar Singh being elected
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Maza 
Kapurthala in  uh there the turn-out will inevitably be
""
""
Because the fear of the terrorist is much more there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
country  ?
""
""
election  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
properly 
""
""
""
It is also obvious that  is much more acute in
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
than in 
""
So  the fear element will be much stronger in the countryside
""
""
The Hindu-Sikh problem  which can not be
""
""
And if the Sikh turn out  I mean Sikhs are concentrated in the
rural areas 
""
not so helpful 
""
But there is no option now
""
""
There is no option and 
""
""
And the government  should be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sure 
""
""
""
how much of the voter abstention is on account of fear  ?
""
And how much on account of aversion  ?
""
The very fact  that
 indicates that
""
recognition 
""
""
cynical  it would not be
""
""
""
""
A J P held out no such threat of the kind 
""
 we do not like these
""
""
""
""
""
Is it not the case than Prem  that the element of fear is the
""
""
""
""
""
terms 
""
""
""
belong to the present attitude 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Now I don't think that the population at large  the Sikhs
""
temper of the State 
""
""
""
""
""
""
They are unhappy  they are cynical to the extent that they
""
""
""
""
""
They are fed up 
""
And uh 
elections like you I do 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And if this is the only way alright we would like to vote
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So there are these two conflicts
""
""
Uh I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Both the Parliamentary and the Assembly yeah  there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
At eighty-five it isn't but eighty-nine parliamentary elections
 plus
""
""
""
""
""
I never do
""
""
Sixty-two point seven in nineteen eighty-nine you had the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
eagerness  would surface if there was not the fear of the
gun  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh and I think  you have to also if there is a sort of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
for a boycott or not it doesn't matter 
""
""
 and factionalism
""
And therefore I have been different  Akali
