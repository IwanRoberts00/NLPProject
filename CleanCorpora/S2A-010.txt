nations in the world

in dive
Oh thinking will be this competition is not very
Yeah very low that's a bit slow 
For them it's a very low competition 
China competing for diving you know they are the world class
 they are the best in the world 
So therefore for them of course there is no competition 
But even then it's good they've come for
swimming atleast and this uh which adds a great glamour and colour
to the competition and so many of these younger children who will be
participating in the age group
Yeah 
This is Indian team which is uh coming in front of you

from the other ten countries will be the names to reckon with in 
atleast the Asian swimming uh scene in the next few years
Yes
These little children of twelve and thirteen who are 
so many of them might be gold medalists in the next Asain Games 
after Hiroshima in the year uh nineteen ninety-eight who knows
