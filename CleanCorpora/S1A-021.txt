And I was very interested  in journalism no

""
""
""
""
""
But then nobody like motivated me 
in that direction so I just left it  interested
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And you also
""
""
""
""
Do you have correspondence course for journalism  ?
""
""
Yeah we have
""
""
Yeah well actually a course is not necessary

In Madras we have this Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan

""
""
In the evening six thirty to eight 
""

""
""
No  quite far
""
""
It is
""
""
Like these things and all they  suburb
""
""
""
""
""
""
But they are connected 
""
""
Yeah buses of course we have a lot of bus 
""
Transport is a 
""
""
But here Mysore is also okay  but Hyderabad is bad
""
""
In Madras you have buses for ladies and 
""
""
Yeah we have ladies bus
""
""
Separate yeah
""
""
We don't have buses for male
""
""
Who travels in these 
""
""
Only ladies
""
""
Only ladies
""
""
Usually 
""
""
""
""
""
And they enjoy  specially in college
specials and all no  these conductors they have kind of
 for the ladies
""
""
""
""
""
Only college
""
""
And they have a 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah yeah college students
""
""
Students 
""
""
""
""
""
Like
""
""
These buses are regular or
""
""
Very regular
""
""
Very regular
""
""
I know ever since  we had
this specials at eight  stand
wait outside our college to pick us up  almost like a college bus special
bus for us 
""
""
That is according to the college  they
""
""
""
""
""
During exams also they will have like that
""
""
Yeah  suppose exams
""
""
But they have the other buses also no 
then
""
""
""
""
""
That you have 
""
""
Madras is known for that you know 
TTB service very best service they have
""
""
""
""
""
And  every year in the beginning of the year we invite all
the  like uh outside one forty when college
gets over around thirteen to fourteen buses to different parts of the city
 will be standing outside the college
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Specially our college girl are  we give uh a very good
reason to this people
""
I mean we give them a party  one or two words
 in your college also
""
""
""
""
""
It is just 
""
""
Oh the WCC they had a  drivers and the
 crew and the principal
""
So that service is not regular that  one or two
I think 
""
But yeah there are so many bus standing outside  and then you
know it is fun 
""
Sometimes the bus are almost empty no like 
the 
""
And like that one we had a bus in Adiyar we have a bus 
""
""
""
""
""
And it is not necessary no  same
bus  see
almost empty 
""
""
""
""
""
But anyway 
and also in buses here in Mysore also 
""
We have the first half for men and the second  half for
women  Hyderabad also it is like that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now they have  uh introduced before it wasn't like that
 means they come
and sit  get up
""
""
We have a lot of quarrel
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That they won't do  never they will do in Madras you know
 get up
""
""
Yeah  and when they
""
""
Now they have
""
""
But one thing
""
""
We have got used to it I think only then  recently some
two months back I think 
""
""
Uhm uhm and in Madras suppose the men are sitting in the
ladies seat  ladies have to go stand next to them they will get up
""
""
 get up
""
""
But the ladies who are sitting in the  seat and
they won't get up
""
""
They won't get up 
""
""
So the men must be standing but  these people they
""
""
""
 you know they get irritated
""
""
The other seats are only for men then
""
""
Yeah this half for women  this half for men
""
""
Oh 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
What about children  ?
""
""
""
""
It is as if very big bus
""
""
No no but then where will they sit 
""
""
Anywhere
""
""
Anywhere
""
""
They can sit anywhere 
""
But this system is better no  one half
""
""
Of course yes that is yeah
""
""
Because then the 
""
""
""
""
So
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm yes
""
""
That really is a problem 
""
""
The buses will be crowded 
""
""
Yeah very crowded
""
""
Full we can't in a crowded 
""
How do you like Mysore ?
