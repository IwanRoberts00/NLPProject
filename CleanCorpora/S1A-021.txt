 It's not in the city ?
No it's quite far
It is
Like these things and all they suburb suburb
 Suburb 
But they are connected 
Yeah buses of course we have a lot of bus 
Transport is a one word 
But here Mysore is also okay but Hyderabad is bad
In Madras you have buses for ladies and 
Yeah we have ladies bus
Separate yeah
We don't have buses for male
Who travels in these 
Only ladies
Only ladies
Usually you have 
 Only the driver and conductor laughter 
And they enjoy laughter specially in college
specials and all no yeah these conductors they have kind of
 uh competition who will go for the ladies
 Yeah 
Only college
And they have a special organisation also no 
 A few words 
Yeah yeah college students
Students yeah we have they organise 
 Yeah we have 
Like
These buses are regular or
Very regular
Very regular
I know ever since like when I was studying we had
this specials at eight O'clock and at one forty they stand
wait outside our college to pick us up almost like a college bus special
bus for us 
That is according to the college times they
 College time 
During exams also they will have like that
Yeah suppose exams
But they have the other buses also no yeah 
then
 Yeah 
That you have 
Madras is known for that you know yeah yeah 
TTB service very best service they have
 Yeah yeah 
And every year in the beginning of the year we invite all
the the crew no yeah like uh outside one forty when college
gets over around thirteen to fourteen buses to different parts of the city
 uhm will be standing outside the college
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
Specially our college girl are we give uh a very good
reason to this people
I mean we give them a party and we one or two words
 in your college also
 Even in our college 
It is just 
Oh the WCC they had a one word drivers and the
 PBC crew and the principal
So that service is not regular that it has once one or two
I think 
But yeah there are so many bus standing outside and then you
know it is fun 
Sometimes the bus are almost empty no like yeah 
the one word 
And like that one we had a bus in Adiyar we have a bus 
 Yeah 
And it is not necessary no you can have the same
bus which passes through Adiyar to Tirvani but we have to see
almost empty 
 Same bus 
But anyway it is very comfortable oh yeah 
and also in buses here in Mysore also 
We have the first half for men and the second half for
women Hyderabad also it is like that
 Oh yeah 
 Even in Hyderabad 
Now they have uh introduced before it wasn't like that
 uhm uhm and still there is a problem people means they come
and sit on the ladies seat and they won't they get up
 get up 
We have a lot of quarrel
 Uhm uhm 
 Get up 
That they won't do never they will do in Madras you know
 even if they sit they'll get up
Yeah and when they
Now they have
But one thing
We have got used to it I think only then recently some
two months back I think 
Uhm uhm and in Madras suppose the men are sitting in the
ladies seat ladies have to go stand next to them they will get up
 They'll get up
But the ladies who are sitting in the men's seat and
they won't get up
They won't get up laughter 
So the men must be standing but these people they
 They get irritated you know they get irritated
The other seats are only for men then
Yeah this half for women this half for men
Oh that's 
Uhm
What about children ?
 Laughter 
It is as if very big bus
No no but then where will they sit 
Anywhere
Anywhere
They can sit anywhere 
But this system is better no one half
Of course yes that is yeah
Because then the in Madras what happens standing uh 
 that place is common 
 It's there but it's common no 
So
 It's not there 
Uhm yes
That really is a problem 
The buses will be crowded 
Yeah very crowded
Full we can't in a crowded 
How do you like Mysore ?
 Laughter of course I didn't do much of sight- seeing
Went to the Palace 
Palace is okay the Art Gallery is nice 
So you went to the Art Gallery
Yeah 
That is in the Palace no ?
 It's another Palace uhm there are two 
Recently I went to Jaipur Palace and that is beautiful and compare
to that this is very one word 
Jaipur Palace is bigger than this ?
 It's bigger and uh it's more beautiful
 and has more exhibit 
Here I didn't see much like we had all the clothes of the 
kingdom queen and the jewellery and
 But you won't find jewellery yeah
And jwellery one word clothes all that were not
there
You had to one word 
 A few words gold

The clothes are also not there 
They had sixty KGs of gold on one saree and all
that oh in Jaipur
 Oh

Uhn it's all glasses uhm uhm whole
kind of full of glass mirror it's not glass mirror beautiful
 Uhm uhm 
You you went anywhere ?
No I didn't go but I was just enjoying the climate here 
laughter that's how like we came from the hot
no
 Yeah in Madras it is very 
Yeah but it's not very healthy no climate
Yeah of course
 It's not very healthy
Yeah because one or two words 
Even even the my relative here she was telling us see it
doesn't uh agree with everybody 
You get cold not only cold digestion problem then
the if you have asthma it's it's worse
 Cold 
Yeah
 It's not a very healthy place I believe
Probably because of the one word you know 
You have one word in here ?

No I have been to Vrindavan garden before now one or
two words
