Hello viewers 
""
Nearly all aspects of Journalism have been undergoing a
metamorphisis in recent times 
""
Wide ranging changes have gripped the media
""
Some for the better
""
Some for the worse 
""
The glossies as they are called 
""
And even seem to be thriving 
""
Uh there has been a wave of Investigative Journalism  uh which
has brought along controversies of its own
""
Today we have with us  Mr Dileep Padgaonkar the editor of
 who will speak to us on the modern
trends in journalism today 
""
Mr Padgaonkar  Sourgone
""
""
He has been a correspondent of the  Times of India
""
with the UNESCO 
""
Uh today 
a 
""
Uh diplomacy in diplomatic actions  and the polarisating within
the media itself 
""
Mr Padgaonkar  apart from the technological advancements in
what way does present day journalism differ from that in the immediate post
independence 
""
""
There have been differences I think at three levels 
clearing his throat 
""
The first is that  the built medium has
become very much more competitive than it was in the years immediately after
Independence
""
""
Yes
""
""
And this  brought into its
wake 
""
Among encouraging trends I think is the 
emphasis on the professionalism  on presentation on packaging so on so
forth 
""
The discouraging trend is of course that  the very competition
has given rise  journalism
sensationlism
""
And I refer in particular to film journalism
""
Though it is not restricted merely to film journalism
""
You find much of  even
in poliltical journalism
""
And lately imperative journalism 
""
So this is the the first  uh change that I I can see
""
The other change has been brought about by technology itself
""
I think the  uh revolution has been witnessed in the field of
 uh print technology in particular
""
The question of gathering data storing it retrieving it processing
it and so on has made uh it possible for news papers  now to have a
cleaner look of brighter look to meet their deadlines of course there  are
""
""
But this is the second factor  uh gone long way I
think to bring about several changes  in journalism
""
Thirdly  also brought
into play  in the
immediate  uh uhm years after independence
""
Today you have uh  sports in
motoring in yatching  uh in architecture and so on so forth
""
And what this 
uh pluralism 
""
Discipline-wise  fashion
and these three trends taken together is meant that 
journalism  by our
parents and our grandparents 
""
""
""
""
""
What about the editorial content which which is 
""
They had this  identity ferver then you know but today they are
tended to 
""
""
You know  not one of those who believes that what
the 
""
uh gripped by mercantilents 
""
I think mercantilents were present then 
""
They are present today 
""
Those idealisms then and there is  considerable idealism today
""
I say this because I I deal with  then
""
""
I take an active interest in the training of journalism  in my
own newspaper 
""
And uh then I feel that atleast in the initial years  they
aren't corroded by  have
""
""
Uh  manner
in which market forces 
""
""
is 
""
This is happening everywhere in all countries where you have 
the free market and a free press
""
But 
""
The fact that  are supposed to
be  conversant atleast with what market trends are being yet what the
trends are and the area of production  in the area of circulation and so
on so forth
""
It means that  the pictures will have of the
editor  and concentrates all day and
produces his handling editorials
""
That picture I think is part of the  of which is uh
""
""
""
Uh  seen uh
""
""
Uh industrial houses have taken a keen interest in starting a
newspaper of their own you know 
""
Uh what do you feel of it
""
""
Yes there again you know you should take a look at the major
uh  uh in the English language
""
Your  were always controlled by Industrial Houses
""
""
But what 
""
""
 something to do with journalism
""
They were not purely Industrial Houses as such
""
""
No
""
You had certain newspapers  which were
 in the field of publication
of magazines and newspapers
""
You see if you take a look at the 
 The
Hindu 
""
You always had some of them whose sole business was this 
""
What 
uh industrialists with 
newspapers to their  uh to their table sources
""
Uh and then your coyright
""
""
""
It might not really  for money
""
That is  I can tell you that newspapers though form of uh
profitable today 
""
Some of them atleast 
""
 business
ventures 
""
Uh probably many of them 
by starting newspapers 
""
I have my own reservations for this
""
""
So the powers can be misused you say
""
""
So the powers can be used
""
But I I had my own  a newspaper
must be really enjoying
""
I mean you know  your first
name by the power  of the woman
""
If that is clouting may be this 
""
But if you see the manner in which the official media  are
handled 
gear up doubles for what the print media writes
""
So even this business of clout write is some what exaggerated
""
""
But then this is in contradiction to the what happens to to
 shares in a
particular newspaper
""
""
Of course it does 
""
But much depends also on how much that particular  industry
""
stand  a pressure on him
""
I know another industrialist  facing the
wrath of government  ten ten years
""
And uh while the scoop of the particular industrialist 
doesn't 
""
The fact is  short of the great deal of grit and comes
to me  in in defending these matters
""
I think 
there're 
fashion elsewhere
""
And the current fad is that  have
a magazine let me have a daily newspaper and so on so forth
""
My own view is this will  this too record will fade away fast
""
""
""
To what do you attribute the  plori plorify plori
 as they call
""
""
And 
""
Even though they are very few and less at times
""
""
No they are successful because no editing
""
I think ten percent now  on presentation
use of uh 
""
Uh 
and uh today you have a supplement on blazed paper 
""
Uh you even have suppliments on art paper
""
And I won`t be surprised if you in due course  you have
supplements uh with perfume in them  and may be even a
musical note
""
""
""
""
""
You mean to say  readers can be carried away by its
""
""
""
""
certainly that that one little difference  uh which makes it possible for
attractive packaging 
""
This is of other areas if you see what happens for  detergents
or soaps or 
""
You see that  a really aggressive form of marketing
""
""
The advertising 
what sets 
""
""
So newspaper has become like any other product
""
""
I think 
you can  that more and more people own newspapers regard
newspapers  then in terms of the public
service 
""
""
Uh  should change
naturally
""
""
It is exactly
""
But you know  it has
to come sooner or later 
""
If you feel that people are putting in their money investing 
naturally  uh reasons
then I think  not up to the mark
""
Increasing 
uh  be a closer
interaction  and the
managing sides of newspaper
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Uh in recent times newspapers  uh major
 either belonging
to the opposition  or which are very pro-government
""
What do you have to say?
""
""
I think the observation is
""
""
Especially in the objectivity point of view
""
""
Yes  and
sad 
""
Because I think some newspapers  have taken it upon themselves
""
""
Like some others have sought to use newspapers for their 
economic or business for example 
""
Uh  the polarisation you talk of is radio reflection of
polarisation 
""
And to that extend it is inevitable 
""
But do newspapers contribute to the polarisation I feel yes alas
they do 
""
Whereas uh the functions of a newspapers  seen are
ready to 
""
Partly because ideological has come between we no longer have 
the certainties of  this or that ideology
""
Things are from there 
""
And in its place in that vacuum that has been created what you
have  but self interest
""
""
And self interest 
petty vulgar  sort of it
""
So that extend I think you are right there is a polarisation I
deplore it 
""
Uh I try to resist  it
""
But unless 
and until the country learns to accept that 
not  one truth with the capital T
""
But many truths which have to 
""
Uh it is then that you can see their involvement 
""
And then the involvement of the of the journalists and the
newspapers
""
Uh  are
used more and more for partisans interests 
""
I think 
exactly what they feel like
""
And such comment as you want to make  should be confined to the
""
""
 a
""
""
""
""
""
But 
theorists  especially in a country like
in India 
""
There  to be some agency which
takes 
""
And at times peoples might have to take the role of the opposition
""
""
But some people  agree to this
""
What is what is your opinion ?
""
""
No no
""
 that you see it is it is true that you know because
institutions have tumbleded whether it is parliament  whether it is
judiciary  readily been given
to the press 
""
Uh 
happen in in developed countries 
""
And once you do that you got to be the saviour of the institutions
""
 promoting causes
""
""
didn't 
""
For example  that the press
reported the going on in the parliament 
""
Today  going from the parliament are determined by
what it is the press 
""
And  a
dangerous switch over 
""
But certainly it is not as accountable or as immediately
accountable or as determinately accountable  the elected
representatives of people 
""
And to try and  for them
""
""
""
So do you think that certain code of conduct should be 
the immediate code of conduct because now we have a very loose
""
""
I  think either a rigid code or a flexible
codes could work  because partly as you rightly point out there is this
polarisation 
""
So on what basis can you have 
""
My feeling is there is  in the
newspaper world
""
For what newspaper ought to be 
""
Uh  was
brought together
""
We managed to beat that back 
""
We also stood together when recently the Jammu and Kashmir
Government 
""
But this kind of solidarity remains very fragile 
""
Uh otherwise there is  clear polarisation in the
newspaper world
""
And I 
""
For a code of conduct even a flexible one you need a measure of
consensus and that consensus mind you does not exist at the moment
