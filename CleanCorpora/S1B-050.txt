Hello viewers 
""
""
metamorphisis in recent times 
""
Wide ranging changes have gripped the media
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And even seem to be thriving 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh today 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
independence 
""
""
There have been differences I think at three levels 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And this  brought into its
""
""
Among encouraging trends I think is the 
""
""
""
The discouraging trend is of course that  the very competition
has given rise  journalism
sensationlism
""
And I refer in particular to film journalism
""
""
""
You find much of  even
""
""
And lately imperative journalism 
""
So this is the the first  uh change that I I can see
""
The other change has been brought about by technology itself
""
""
""
""
""
""
cleaner look of brighter look to meet their deadlines of course there  are
""
""
But this is the second factor  uh gone long way I
""
""
Thirdly  also brought
into play  in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They had this  identity ferver then you know but today they are
tended to 
""
""
You know  not one of those who believes that what
the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is 
""
This is happening everywhere in all countries where you have 
""
""
""
""
The fact that  are supposed to
""
trends are and the area of production  in the area of circulation and so
""
""
""
editor  and concentrates all day and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
newspaper of their own you know 
""
""
""
""
""
uh  uh in the English language
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of magazines and newspapers
""
You see if you take a look at the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 business
ventures 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
must be really enjoying
""
""
name by the power  of the woman
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But then this is in contradiction to the what happens to to
 shares in a
particular newspaper
""
""
""
""
""
""
stand  a pressure on him
""
I know another industrialist  facing the
""
""
""
""
""
The fact is  short of the great deal of grit and comes
""
""
""
there're 
fashion elsewhere
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And 
""
Even though they are very few and less at times
""
""
No they are successful because no editing
""
I think ten percent now  on presentation
use of uh 
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You mean to say  readers can be carried away by its
""
""
""
""
certainly that that one little difference  uh which makes it possible for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The advertising 
""
""
""
So newspaper has become like any other product
""
""
I think 
you can  that more and more people own newspapers regard
""
""
""
""
""
naturally
""
""
""
""
""
to come sooner or later 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
managing sides of newspaper
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Especially in the objectivity point of view
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  the polarisation you talk of is radio reflection of
""
""
""
""
""
they do 
""
Whereas uh the functions of a newspapers  seen are
""
""
""
the certainties of  this or that ideology
""
""
""
And in its place in that vacuum that has been created what you
have  but self interest
""
""
""
petty vulgar  sort of it
""
""
deplore it 
""
""
""
""
and until the country learns to accept that 
""
""
But many truths which have to 
""
""
""
""
newspapers
""
Uh  are
""
""
""
exactly what they feel like
""
And such comment as you want to make  should be confined to the
""
""
 a
""
""
""
""
""
""
theorists  especially in a country like
""
""
There  to be some agency which
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is what is your opinion ?
""
""
No no
""
""
institutions have tumbleded whether it is parliament  whether it is
judiciary  readily been given
""
""
Uh 
""
""
And once you do that you got to be the saviour of the institutions
""
""
""
""
didn't 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
dangerous switch over 
""
""
accountable or as determinately accountable  the elected
representatives of people 
""
And to try and  for them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
codes could work  because partly as you rightly point out there is this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For what newspaper ought to be 
""
Uh  was
brought together
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh otherwise there is  clear polarisation in the
newspaper world
""
""
