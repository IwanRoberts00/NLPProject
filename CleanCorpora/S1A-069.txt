<I>
Uhn
Yes 
I see 
I was working there in one project yeah for one
year 
 Yeah 
With whom that uh 
Uh Dr Lal 
Much glad
So do I
Lad 
Lal Lal 
Lal Lal 
Now you joined here some three years ago 
Four 
Four years ago 
No three years ago three three and half years you are
not going sir 
Uhn probably 
No no not like that physical 
No physical I'm alright 
I thought you are
I am yet differed because of the some problems knotty
problem 
As a head of any institution it has to be there 
Loudly laughs 
As a head of any institution the problem 
Yeah you must face yeah 
Yeah I think that is the first requirement of that
chair laughs 
But anyway that way our department is quite cool and calm that
is what we think yeah students I don't know what
staff members feel 
 Yeah 
That way what you say is correct
 Haan yeah there is not much of a politics and
uh people are quite cool 
Even non- teaching staff is good 
Cooperative
Faithful and cooperative 
But that will become element 
 That's always
Prospectus element yes beside it's 
very in their way in their own way 
 Yes 
Yeah 
And they erupt some time they try to show there it will
solve they want to show that one word in the department 
they make sometime 
 You've worked on Synthelysis or electrons 
Synthelysis not analysis
Not analysis 
What is this sythelysis when the anyway you are going to have your
appendix but say for a common man like Dr Shastri
 
Yeah for a common man yeah 
So how do you say intellectual and what is a viva 
in a very general term
Yeah in general term I can uh say there is uh a layer
called as Ionosphere in the in earth's upper atmosphere 
You may be knowing about it
Yeah
If you are uh 
I may be
If you are studying science
Yeah
No no I have different side
 
I am in English 
No you can
So this uh this Ionosphere is held by ionised electrons in
sufficient numbers so as to affect the radio waves latitude 
They effect on the radio valency they have the effect on radio
valency 
Now this uh Ionosphere though it has all the ionised
species and all 
Now it's very nuclei ionised plasma because the 
air density at that height where this ionosphere is present
 
But what I could understand is not some physics that's 
something your your uh personal things you know like you were in Bombay
or you were in Goa 
Goa that way we will
 
That is much Indian understand laughs they are
appreciated now rather than 
But you see their is another side of her life
 
Uh ha 
Which seems more more interesting 
She is uh defending uh uhm rights of these uh one uh
rights of women 
 
Oh rights of women 
Or legal no no on the legal side
 
 That's very interesting 
On the legal side not on so social side 
No even on social side
But uh
When I was working yeah I was working with one
organisation which had many activities of this type 
And I have got even uh experience of working with family
council and uh legal examiners 
 Haan that's what it's legal
examiner
Legal examiner 
Then how many cases you have handled so far 
Uh as a social worker I have handled around eighty to
hundred cases hundred cases
Uhn 
Because that legalised centre which we had we 
we used to have a thrice a week 
And you won't believe sir the day we had the office it was
 fully crowded on those days since morning till evening 
And we were so many of them some fifteen twenty people 
We used to sit in one one corner with one one lady and with
her family and that boys side and uh husband's side and 
her side her father mother and everyone 
And that chou chou chou laughs 
I see 
 It's really I mean when you go into that na
 we realised that there are so many not only I'm not
talking about women but there are so many things in our society which
 have not yet come upto that superficial level or at the discussion level
And so many supress things within the family they affect
individual ways very much 
So for example you can think of something which is
dreadful event one case which you would call very much far
Uh uh there was uh there was one very peculiar case uh
in the sense that it was from the very low income group 
They they used to stay in Bombay you know slum kind of area 
Not fully slum but you can call it uh semi- slum kind of thing
And that man he was the only son of that man 
And uh he had some three or four sisters all of them they were
unmarried 
Unmarried in the sense they were uh of course they were 
younger to him that is why they were unmarried he was the eldest and he
was married 
Uh his first marriage was broken in the sense that uh because
of the torture from these sister-in-laws sisters-in-law
 and from mother-in-law and from father-in-law 
She left him and in that category I mean like low income
group they don't go for all these uh legal processes through
court and all 
The breaking that is the divorce is a very simple thing 
They just leave the person and then they go 
Then he got married to a girl from his own relations that
is uh his mama's daughter cousin sister
And even then she was having a similar kind of torture 
torture means I cannot explain you to what extent that torture was
That girl she had to go in that uh common lavotory
In Bombay in the slum areas there are these common toilets and
common bathroom 
So she had to go there 
She used to come back window she used to call someone 
She used to tell them that please give me some chapati
 or some bread to eat 
I mean it was that kind of thing they were not giving her food
 no water no food 
And they used to and when we had some people setting it
We really couldn't find out what identify what is the problem
Actually that her husband was a good man 
The only thing is he used to drink
He was a worker in some factory 
He used to drink a little bit 
He never used to hit her like nothing 
But all this people they used to harass her 
Then after three four sittings we realised that the problem is 
he is the only earning source of the family 
And all of them they had this fear that if this person if
he has a very good relationship with his wife and if there is a sound
relationship fam sound family life there is a possibility of
him going and staying separate 
Oh 
So that was the sole reason for this torture to the 
daughter-in-law 
You know that's a fact 
And then we had to
Complex issues 
And then we had to uhm inform her father 
Her father was in some village 
She didn't know the address properly
She was illiterate 
And then he was working with one sugar factory 
so at the address of sugar factory so somehow we contacted
some official to tell her husband that if this if this person working
with you then we found out his address we used to go to him we informed him
So then he came to Bombay we talked to him
But these people they didn't even allow her to meet him 
And there were so many problems and finally we rescued that
girl because she didn't want she had the total one word 
Uhm 
So she was sent back to her parents 
But one good thing in this case was the parents were ready to take
her like 
I see
And yeah in certain cases they they refused they say that
we don't 
If she she is married she is to come out of the house and
she has to die and she has to come out 
That is she is not allowed to come out 
Atleast in this case they were ready to take her 
Fine 
What we did anything
And that man didn't comment anything 
He didn't say anything 
He had no voice 
Though he was the earning soul he was treated or or he was
atleast he was brought up he started earning very early at early age
So I think he was brought up in that manner that uh you know
 in this entire world his parents and his sisters is 
are everything for him nothing more other relationships
are not important 
You work so many and uh it was really a I mean it's
 very difficult to work continously at this branch you yourself uh
 and then you have so many problems of your own listening to all
things no then you disturb you get disturb like emotionally 
mentally 
There is one case in our department right now
Is it 
That that uh different case is it's not a
bit uhm yet selfish to say
Uhm 
But the problem is that girl's father came 
and got her admission under the V J N T quota 
Which quota
V J 
Uhn 
 Vimukhta Jati 
 Haan haan yeah
Some nomadic tribe
Some nomadic tribe 
And she went through the waiting list and all that 
But according to medical level we have to categorise she got 
Now she completed part one then part two and she gave 
her specialisation theoritical specialisation
Uhm uhm
She is the only one in the batch
Is it
This girl sat for this
Uhm uhm
So I was surprised that uh record uh showing class
student it gave uh subject of such a high a few words 
Then uhm after that she joined 
The classes started her father came 
Then he talked to me one and half hours in Marathi like
that 
 
Uhm 
So that lady's father came and told me that
uh he he is responsible for her education and uh you know there must
be coersive data 
And uhm uh and she must marry to a person uhn who is
some relative 
But who is a uh rock breaker 
Uhm uhm 
Not educated 
But uh the family relationship required the man uhn the father
 to fix that she had to marry that fellow 
Now then uh but personally I don't know how to solve
this problem and she stopped attending the classes now 
Now she will get marry 
No we don't know because she refuse she refused to
stay in the hostel though her father is paying the money she got the
admission in the hostel 
She is staying with somebody in the city 
She is uh
And uh
I I don't think that she will agree for this 
She will not agree but she will not study
My problem is how do you solve her educational problem 
 I'm not worried about her
 That is uh 
As I said it will take uh sometime in the sense when she
will uh get settled mentally
No that's not the point 
When you take a subject like theoritical physics the proper
environment in the first week itself you've to study book if
it is not so this is not something like you can wait to it's not
history or geography 
Uhm 
When the same classmate same group of students are
studying one has to study
Uhm
If they miss that bus it's very difficult for
them to cope up and adjust 
You may say that I'll settle the life after uh 
some day
Has she has she talked to you or uh 
No she is not opening her mouth at all 
She is so obstinate she comes to the classroom she is dead
silent no sign on the face 
Not even acknowledging presence of others 
She is she is slight so stern and strong willed 
So she was not like this in one word or uh have
you have you found out any sudden changes in her behaviour 
Definitely much more than she was last year
Uhm last year she was quite social
Some not quite
But little bit 
Little bit
She has cut off 
Now she is not attending classes 
And if she doesn't attend I've to cancel her uh 
Admission 
But ususally what they say I have to do in the
vacation 
Then the government of India has given thirty percent reservation
in this category 
Yeah yeah that reservation is said only for the government
services isn't it 
Like how it is for other uh 
No it may be implemented na say for
admissions 
For admissions 
Oh
Is it
Uhm why not 
Not present why thirty percent in the nomination they're
 put so and actually for every type of uh activity for
group 
That is educational political administrative any kind
of uh national activity 
And Muncipality they are having certificates
Yeah they have held 
People are contesting now elections
In Kolhapur was the first city to
 Yeah 
Have a both Mayor and deputy Mayor Mayor yeah that is
Mayor came under that category 
Women woman
Uhm now thirty percent reservation 
 Thirty percent reservation 
Certain seats were reserved so certain constituency they
were reserved for women 
So Kolhapur is the first city in Maharashtra after this
rule came 
Uhm
We had that uh election 
So naturally Kolhapur may be Shivaji University may be
the first university in implementing this thirty
 
Not fashionable to talk about uh women lib and all that
But uh laughter 
Women lib has nothing to do
 
I know obviously 
Women lib is a problem of the West 
Uhm 
Here the women programmes I think they are social
 
Yeah they are social more then uh yeah 
I exactly I don't know obligation 
 
What are you going to do after completing your Ph d 
I will try to find out some job 
 It's always apex Kolhapur Bombay Goa
Ah nai I don't think that uh I will be
in Goa 
Uhn I don't want to change the state but most probably
 I'll concentrate in Bombay and Poona 
Have you uh taken up any place here in Kolhapur
Uhm so after coming to Kolhapur it was told to me
that I'm supposed to concentrate only on my work and not on
anything else 
 
Like a good girl 
Like a good girl laughs it's first time in
my life I've obeyed someone laughs
