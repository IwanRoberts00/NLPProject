<I>
""
""
Uhn
""
""
Yes 
""
""
I see 
""
""
I was working there in one project  for one
year 
""
""
""
""
""
With whom that uh 
""
""
Uh Dr Lal 
""
""
Much glad
""
""
So do I
""
""
Lad 
""
""
Lal Lal 
""
""
Lal 
""
Now 
""
""
Four 
""
""
Four years ago 
""
""
No three years ago  you are
not going sir 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
No no not like that 
""
""
No physical 
""
""
I thought you are
""
""
I am yet  because of the some problems knotty
problem 
""
""
As a head of any 
""
""
Loudly 
""
""
As a head of any institution 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Yeah  that
chair 
""
But anyway that way our department is quite  cool and calm that
is what  what
staff members feel 
""
""
""
""
""
That way  what you say is correct
""
""
 yeah there is not much of a politics and
uh 
""
Even non- teaching staff is good 
""
""
Cooperative
""
""
Faithful and cooperative 
""
""
But that will become element 
""
""
 always
""
""
Prospectus element 
very 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And they erupt some time  they try to show there it will
solve 
they make sometime 
""
""
""
""
Synthelysis not analysis
""
""
Not analysis 
""
What is this sythelysis when the anyway you are going to have your
appendix  like Dr Shastri
""
""
Yeah for a common man 
""
""
So how do you 
in a very general term
""
""
Yeah in general term I can uh say  a layer
called as Ionosphere 
""
You may be knowing about it
""
""
Yeah
""
""
If you are uh 
""
""
I may be
""
""
If you are studying science
""
""
Yeah
""
No no I have different side
""
""
I am in English 
""
""
No you can
""
""
So this uh this Ionosphere is held by ionised electrons  in
sufficient numbers 
""
They effect on the radio valency  they have the effect on radio
valency 
""
Now this uh  though it has all the ionised
species and all 
""
Now 
air density  at that height where this ionosphere is present
""
""
But what I could understand is not some physics 
something your your uh  personal things you know like you were in Bombay
or you were in Goa 
""
""
Goa that way we will
""
""
That is much Indian understand  they are
appreciated now rather than 
""
""
But you see their is another side of her life
""
""
Uh ha 
""
""
Which seems more more interesting 
""
She is uh defending uh  one uh
rights of women 
""
""
Oh rights of women 
""
""
Or legal  no no on the legal side
""
""
""
""
""
On the legal side not on 
""
""
No even on social side
""
""
But uh
""
""
When I was working  yeah I was working with one
organisation which had many activities of this type 
""
And I have got even uh  family
council 
""
""
 legal
examiner
""
""
Legal examiner 
""
""
Then how many cases you have handled so far 
""
""
Uh  eighty to
hundred cases  hundred cases
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Because 
we used to have a thrice a week 
""
And you won't believe sir  it was
""
""
And we were so many of them 
""
We used to sit in one one corner with  lady and with
her family and 
her side her father mother and everyone 
""
And that 
""
""
I see 
""
""
 na
 not
talking about women  but there are so many things in our society which
 have not yet come upto that superficial level or at the discussion level
""
""
And so many supress things within the family  they affect
individual ways very much 
""
""
So  for example you can think of something which is
dreadful event  which you would call very much far
""
""
Uh uh there was uh there was one  uh
in the sense that it was from the 
""
They they used to stay in Bombay you know 
""
Not fully slum but you can call it uh semi-  slum kind of thing
""
""
And that man he was the only son of that man 
""
And uh he had some three or four sisters  all of them they were
unmarried 
""
Unmarried in the sense they were uh 
younger to him  that is why they were unmarried he was the eldest and he
was married 
""
Uh his first marriage was broken in the sense that uh  because
of the torture from these  sisters-in-law
""
""
She left him  that category I mean like low income
group  through
court and all 
""
The 
""
They just leave the person and then they go 
""
Then he got married to a girl from his own  that
is uh  cousin sister
""
""
And even then 
torture means I cannot explain you to what extent that torture was
""
That girl  lavotory
""
In Bombay  in the slum areas there are these common toilets and
common bathroom 
""
So she had to go there 
""
She used to come back window she used to call someone 
""
She used to tell them that please give me some  chapati
""
""
I mean it was that  kind of thing they were not giving her food
""
""
And they used to  when we had some people setting it
""
""
We really couldn't find out what identify what is the problem
""
Actually that her husband was a good man 
""
The only thing is he used to drink
""
He was a worker in some factory 
""
He used to drink a little bit 
""
He never used to 
""
But all this people they used to harass her 
""
Then after three four sittings we realised that the problem is 
he is the only earning source of the family 
""
And all of them they had this fear  if
he has a very good relationship with his wife  and if there is a sound
relationship  there is a possibility of
him going and staying separate 
""
""
Oh 
""
""
So that was the sole reason for this torture to the 
daughter-in-law 
""
""
You know that's a fact 
""
""
And then we had to
""
""
Complex issues 
""
""
And then we had to 
""
Her father was in some village 
""
She didn't know the address properly
""
She was illiterate 
""
And then he was working with one sugar factory 
""
so at the address of sugar factory so somehow we  contacted
some official to tell her husband  that if this if this person working
with you then we found out his address we used to go to him we informed him
""
""
So  to Bombay we talked to him
""
But these people they didn't even allow her to meet him 
""
And there were so many problems and finally  we rescued that
girl because 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So she was sent back to her parents 
""
But one good thing in this case was the parents were ready to take
her like 
""
""
I see
""
""
And yeah in certain cases they they refused  they say that
we don't 
""
If she she is married  and
she has to die and she has to come out 
""
That is she is not allowed to come out 
""
Atleast in this case they were ready to take her 
""
""
Fine 
""
""
What we did anything
""
""
And that man didn't comment anything 
""
""
He didn't say anything 
""
He had no voice 
""
Though he was the earning soul  treated or or he was
atleast he was brought up  at early age
""
""
So I think he was brought up in that manner that uh  you know
""
are  other relationships
are not important 
""
You work so many and uh it was really a  it's
 you yourself uh
 listening to all
things no 
mentally 
""
""
There is one case in our department  right now
""
""
Is it 
""
""
That that uh  not a
bit  uhm yet selfish to say
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But the problem is 
and got her admission under the V J N T quota 
""
""
Which quota
""
""
V J 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
""
""
""
 yeah
""
""
Some nomadic tribe
""
""
Some nomadic tribe 
""
""
And she went through the waiting list and all that 
""
But according to medical level we have to categorise she got 
""
Now she completed part one 
her specialisation  theoritical specialisation
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
She is the only one in the batch
""
""
Is it
""
""
This girl sat for this
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
So I was surprised that uh  showing class
student 
""
Then 
""
The classes started 
""
Then he talked to me  like
that 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So  that
uh  education and uh you know there must
be coersive data 
""
And uhm  who is
some relative 
""
But who is a 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Not educated 
""
But uh the family relationship required the man  uhn the father
""
""
Now  I don't know how to solve
this problem 
""
""
Now she will get marry 
""
""
No we don't know  she refused to
stay in the hostel  she got the
admission in the hostel 
""
She is staying with somebody in the city 
""
""
She is uh
""
""
And uh
""
""
I I don't think that she will agree for this 
""
""
She will not agree but she will not study
""
My problem is how do you solve her educational problem 
""
 worried about her
""
""
""
""
""
As I said it will take uh  sometime in the sense when she
will uh  get settled mentally
""
""
No 
""
When you take a subject like theoritical physics  the proper
environment  if
it is not so  not
history or geography 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
When the same classmate  same group of students are
studying  one has to study
""
""
Uhm
""
""
If they miss that bus  very difficult for
them to cope up and adjust 
""
You may say that 
some day
""
""
Has she has she talked to you or uh 
""
""
No she is not opening her mouth at all 
""
She is so obstinate  she is dead
silent 
""
Not even acknowledging 
""
She is she is slight 
""
""
So she was not like this in  or uh have
you have you found out any sudden changes in her behaviour 
""
""
Definitely  than she was last year
""
""
Uhm  last year she was quite social
""
""
Some  not quite
""
""
But little bit 
""
""
Little bit
""
""
She has cut off 
""
""
Now she is not attending classes 
""
And if she doesn't attend 
""
""
Admission 
""
""
But ususally  in the
vacation 
""
Then the government of India has given thirty percent reservation
in this category 
""
""
Yeah yeah that reservation is said only for the government
services 
""
Like how it is for other uh 
""
""
No it may be implemented  say for
admissions 
""
""
For admissions 
""
""
Oh
""
""
Is it
""
""
Uhm 
""
Not present why  they're
 for
group 
""
That is educational  any kind
of uh 
""
And Muncipality they are having certificates
""
""
Yeah they have held 
""
""
People are contesting now elections
""
""
In Kolhapur was the first  to
""
""
""
""
""
Have a both Mayor and deputy Mayor  Mayor yeah that is
Mayor came under that category 
""
Women woman
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
Certain seats were reserved  so certain constituency they
were reserved for women 
""
So Kolhapur is the first  after this
rule came 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
We had that uh election 
""
""
So naturally Kolhapur may be  Shivaji University may be
the first university in implementing this  thirty
""
""
Not fashionable to talk about uh  women lib and all that
""
But uh 
""
""
Women lib has nothing to do
""
""
I know 
""
""
Women lib is a problem of the West 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Here the women programmes I think they are  social
""
""
Yeah they are social 
""
""
I 
""
""
What are you going to do after 
""
""
I will try to find out some job 
""
""
 Goa
""
""
Ah  I will be
in Goa 
""
Uhn I don't want to change the state  most probably
""
""
""
Have you uh taken up any place here in Kolhapur
""
""
Uhm  it was told to me
that  and not on
anything else 
""
""
Like a good girl 
""
""
Like a good girl  first time in
my life
