So how do you

Yeah in general term I can uh say  a layer
called as Ionosphere

Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
species and all 
""
Now 
""
""
""
""
something your your uh  personal things you know like you were in Bombay
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
organisation which had many activities of this type 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Legal examiner 
""
""
""
""
""
""
hundred cases  hundred cases
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And we were so many of them 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
talking about women  but there are so many things in our society which
""
""
""
""
individual ways very much 
""
""
So  for example you can think of something which is
""
""
""
Uh uh there was uh there was one  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And that man he was the only son of that man 
""
And uh he had some three or four sisters  all of them they were
unmarried 
""
Unmarried in the sense they were uh 
""
was married 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The 
""
They just leave the person and then they go 
""
Then he got married to a girl from his own  that
""
""
""
And even then 
""
""
That girl  lavotory
""
""
common bathroom 
""
""
""
She used to come back window she used to call someone 
""
She used to tell them that please give me some  chapati
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We really couldn't find out what identify what is the problem
""
Actually that her husband was a good man 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then after three four sittings we realised that the problem is 
""
""
""
he has a very good relationship with his wife  and if there is a sound
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You know that's a fact 
""
""
""
""
""
Complex issues 
""
""
""
""
Her father was in some village 
""
She didn't know the address properly
""
She was illiterate 
""
And then he was working with one sugar factory 
""
so at the address of sugar factory so somehow we  contacted
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So she was sent back to her parents 
""
But one good thing in this case was the parents were ready to take
""
""
""
I see
""
""
""
we don't 
""
""
she has to die and she has to come out 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What we did anything
""
""
""
""
""
He didn't say anything 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are  other relationships
""
""
You work so many and uh it was really a  it's
""
""
things no 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
bit  uhm yet selfish to say
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But the problem is 
and got her admission under the V J N T quota 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 yeah
""
""
Some nomadic tribe
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now she completed part one 
her specialisation  theoritical specialisation
""
""
""
""
""
She is the only one in the batch
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I was surprised that uh  showing class
student 
""
Then 
""
""
""
Then he talked to me  like
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uhm  who is
""
""
But who is a 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Not educated 
""
""
""
""
""
this problem 
""
""
""
""
""
""
stay in the hostel  she got the
admission in the hostel 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She will not agree but she will not study
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As I said it will take uh  sometime in the sense when she
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it is not so  not
""
""
""
""
""
""
When the same classmate  same group of students are
studying  one has to study
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She is she is slight 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Definitely  than she was last year
""
""
Uhm  last year she was quite social
""
""
Some  not quite
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She has cut off 
""
""
Now she is not attending classes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
services 
""
Like how it is for other uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
group 
""
That is educational  any kind
""
""
And Muncipality they are having certificates
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In Kolhapur was the first  to
""
""
""
""
""
""
Mayor came under that category 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

Certain seats were reserved  so certain constituency they
