Archaeology is said to be concerned with the digging of the
past 
Of its find coins form an important source of knowledge 
Indeed several Kings and Chieftains would have remained
unknown but for the unearthing and study of the coins issued by them 
Further coins reveal the socio-cultural economic 
religious and political life of those times 
And hence the importance of numismatics that is the study of the
coins to the understanding of our ancient Indian history can not be over
emphasised 
My talk is about ancient Andhra coins 
In the evolution of the ancient Indian coinage earliest to be
issued was punch marked coins which was first succeeded by 
uninscribed cast coins and the later by the inscribed coins 
The punch marked coins were in circulation between eighth and second
century B C and these coins were probably in circulation for a little
longer period in the south India 
These coins had no dates and no inscription denoting the name of the
King or the Dynasty to which he belonged 
These coins had only symbols which were marked on them by
punching technique and hence the name punch mark given to them on the
basis of the method of their manufacture 
These are some of the punch marked coins except one at the
top which is made of copper rest of the coins are made of 
silver 
Majority of the punch marked coins are made of silver and
very rarely copper and lead was used for making these coins 
The punch marked coins were manufactured by two methods one is
the cut-sheet process in which the metal was beaten into flat sheets of
appropriate thickness and width and then the coin blanks were cut 
When the metal was still soft the symbols were marked on
them using different punches then the coins were weighed and if they
are found to be overweight edges were clipped and hence majority of
the coins ended up being irregular 
Round and oval kinds were made by different technique 
Weight globules of molten metal were fold into moulds and then
were beaten flat and then the symbols were marked on them by punches 
Hence the shapes of these coins varied from round oval 
squarish rectangular to irregular 
And what you are seeing is the obverse side of the
coins 
And punchmark coins have only symbols imprinted on them on the
obverse side where as the reverse side is always blank 
What you are seeing now is the reverse side of the three of
the punchmark coins 
This side is blank except for few indistinct 
symbols which came to be called as the bankers or officials marks 
Next let us consider when coins came to be issued for the
first time in our country ?
Majority of the numismatists are of the opinion that coins
originated somewhere around eighth century B C 
This assumption is based on two kinds of an evidence that we have
got 
One is the archaeological other literary 
Whenever punchmark coins were found during the excavation 
archaeologists determined the statigraphic level at which these coins
were found 
And next they find out what other material was found associated
with them such as the northern black polished and polished gravier
pottery and so on 
These can be dated by radio carbon method all the available
archaeological evidence confirms that coins were in circulation in our
country from fifth century B C and later 
But the literary evidence reveals that coins were issued in our
country much earlier 
 Arthashastra of Kautilya which was
written in the fourth century B C mentions about punchmark coins 
 pana and its fractions 
It also mentions about ways of detecting counterfeit and forge
coins 
It is clear that coins were made in India prior to fourth
century B C 
 Ashtadhyayi of Panini was said to be
written in the fifth or sixth century B C 
It also clearly mentions about various types of coins like
 pana nishka and satamana 
Hence it is clear that coins were in circulation prior to sixth
century B C 
The earliest literary evidence that probably suggests about
coins is Maitraini Samhita of Yajurveda 
This text is said to be written somewhere around thousand B C
There is a particular reference in this text about a lump of
precious metal which some scholars feel that it was referring to coin
 satmana 
But not all scholars are agreed on this 
From the literary evidence one could not be certain about the
exact period when coins came to be first issued in our country 
But the consensus seems to favour eighth century B C as the
most likely date 
Next I will say few words about the symbols that are found on
the coins 
No less than three hundred different symbols were recorded on
punchmark coins alone 
The symbols on the coins probably represent the king his
dynasty the kingdom the capital city main town and so on 
But at these length of time one could never be certain 
that what each symbol represented 
Roughly these three hundred symbols can be grouped into six
broad catagories 
First depiction of human figure either occuring singly or in
groups 
Second group consists of animal symbols 
Four common animals depicted are the elephant bull horse
and lamb 
Other animals seen are the camel rhinosorous dog bear 
peacock reptiles fish frog and so on 
Third group consists of implements such as bow and arrow 
ladder and ship 
Fourth group consists of trees and flowers 
Fifth group consists of astral and religious symbols 
Last group consists of miscellanious symbols including Ujjain
 and six arm symbol and so on 
One general observation that can be made here is that the
animal symbols are much more common in early series of punchmark coins 
Whereas the hill symbol occurs commonly in later coins 
There are two main types of punchmark coins local and imperial
During eighth to sixth century B C our country consisted of
many tribal states or janapadas 
Local rulers of these states have issued coins for circulation in
the respective regions 
Magadha too started as a small tribal state with Rajgir in Bihar as
the capital but later this state has become very powerful it
expanded its territories then shifted its capital to Patna or Patilaputra
And by the time this state came under the rule of Nanda and
Mauryan dynasties almost the entire country was under their rule 
And coins issued by these dynasties were in circulation
throughout the country 
And these coins came to be called as imperial coins 
Both type of these coins local as well as the imperial 
punchmark coins have very distinctive features 
Local coins or the early coins and naturally they are very
rare to find 
They were of crude design and fabric 
The symbols marked on these coins too are crude 
Weights of these coins too varied from one gram to over twenty
grams 
The number of symbols on the obverse were usually one or two
 but never exceeded four 
In contrast imperial coins were of uniform weight of three
point four grams or fifty-four grams in fresh mint condition 
Obverse had only five symbols and the reverse was blank except
for bankers marks 
Occasionally these coins had counter marks of subsequent rulers
Out of the five symbols two symbols were common to all
these coins that is sun and the six armed symbols 
Hence they are called as the first and second symbol 
Third fourth and fifth symbols were from any of the three
hundred and odd symbols found on the punchmark coins 
These are called as the class group and variety symbols 
What you are seeing now are the drawings of the symbols depicted on
the obverse side of the two punchmark coins sun and six armed symbols
are common to both these coins though the design of the six armed symbol
does vary 
One has four arrow marks whereas the second one has three
arrows and three dot symbols marked inside the triangle 
Third symbol on one coin is the one word whereas
the tree and railing symbol with fish below is seen on the second coin 
Fourth symbol on one coin consists of the four fish symbols 
around a square with a dot inside all enclosed inside a large square 
whereas ankusha thareen and straight line are seen on
the other coin 
Elephant forms the fifth symbol on both these coins 
One coin belongs to one variety whereas the second forms
another variety 
Six hundred such varieties of punchmark coins have so far been
described 
I will now show you the various designs of sun symbol 
Sun is depicted with varying number of rays varying from twelve
to eighteen 
In early coins rays are shown as oblique whereas in subsequent
coins they are seen as radial or straight or horizontal lines 
The second symbol came to be known as the six armed symbol 
This symbol consists of a dot or a circle around which six
symbols are marked 
These could be either six arrows three arrows and three
other symbols which may vary from fish oval rectangle tureen
or any other kind of a design 
Ninety different types of the six armed symbols have been 
found on the punchmark coins 
One more common symbol in later punchmark coins is the tree and
railing various designs of which are shown in this chart 
Another common symbol is the hill symbol 
This is depicted as either showing three arches or arches
vary from anywhere from five to ten 
But three arched hill with a crescent at top is considered
to be the Ashokan or late Mauryan symbol 
I will briefly tell you about the characteristic features of
the local and imperial punchmark coins that were found in Andhra region
When it comes to the local punchmark coins one interesting
observation was that all these coins were made of lead and the
weights of this coins too varied to from one gram to over fifteen grams 
The make of this coins too was somewhat cruder 
But as for the symbols various symbols were found on them 
But three common symbols that were there on these coins was a
crudely designed sun symbol with lesser number of rays 
Second chakra or a wheel symbol 
Thirdly a crude design of a branch with leaves 
These were the features of the early local Andhra coins 
When it comes to the imperial punchmark coins that were found
exclusively in Andhra region I would like to mention about the Amravati
hoard of the punchmark coins 
There were no less than seven thousand six hundred punchmark
coins found at this site 
It had two hundred and eighty-four symbols on them 
Two hundred and thirty-five varieties of punchmark imperial coins
 were found in this hoard 
But what was interesting was that forty-eight varieties of
this kind of a punchmark coins were only found in Andhra region 
This means that even though punchmark coins of the imperial
type of uniform weight and size with common symbols were there
throughout the country but certain varieties were exclusively minted in
each region 
The second series of coins which were issued in our country
after the punchmark coins were the uninscribed cast coins 
These coins were in circulation between sixth to the third
century B C 
In some parts of our country these coins were the first to be
issued and not the punchmark coins 
In the rest of the country these coins were exclusively made
of copper and hence the name uninscribed cast coins was applied to
them 
But majority of the coins which were issued in Andhra region
 were made of lead 
Even though these coins had various symbols four common
symbols that were found on these coins are the hollowcross tarin
 swastika and the one or two words 
Surprisingly the hollowcross which was 
very common in the uninscribed coins of this period does not figure on
the coins which was issued immediately after that is on the inscribed
coins which was issued in this part of the country 
Seventy new types of previously undescribed 
uninscribed coins found in Andhra region were discussed in our
book 
One message that comes through from this study is that though
this region was under the Nanda and Mauryan empire still there were
local rulers or authorities who issued a variety of such coins 
Another important fact to be noticed is that with the
introduction of uninscribed cast coins symbols came to be marked on
either side of the coin whereas punchmark coins had only symbols on
one side and reverse was blank 
After the uninscribed cast coins came the era of the
inscribed coins that means this coins mentioned the name of the king and
the dynasty to which he belonged 
But like the punchmark and uninscribed coins these coins too
never mentioned the date of issue of the coins 
And for that matter none of the Andhra coins prior to the
medieval period ever mentioned either the mint's name or
the date of issue of the coins 
First inscribed coins that came to light in Andhra
region belonged to king Gobhadra 
He was a small local ruler in the Telangana region 
If this is a copper coin issued by king Gobhadra obverse
side shows the script in the centre a bow and arrow symbol at the top
 and right lower part shows the arched hill symbol and tree and
railing symbol to its left 
These coins were followed by such kings as Naranna 
Khambayasa and Samagopa 
There is no literary or historical evidence of the existence
of these four rulers Gobhadra Naranna Khambayasa and Samagopa 
Only through coins we came to know the existence of these rulers
These are two Samagopa coins one on the left side shows
the obverse side of the coin whereas one on the right side shows the
reverse side of an another coin 
Coin on the left side shows the script in the centre and
at the upper part you see a bow and arrow symbol and slightly to its
left you see a part of the sadachakra symbol 
At the lower right hand corner you see the symbol of tree and
railing and to its left you see the tree arch hill symbol with dots
inside 
On the right hand side you see the reverse side of the coin
showing the nandipatha symbol 
Similarly coastal Andhra region was ruled by Meghvahana
dynasty of Kalinga 
There coins too have been discovered in recent times 
Except for one inscription mentioning about the existence
of the Meghvahana ruler there is no other literary or any historical
evidence that how many kings ruled or became part of this
Meghavahana dynasty 
In recent times coins of these kings who ruled northern
coastal region were found and coins give a clue of the names of five
kings who belong to this dynasty
