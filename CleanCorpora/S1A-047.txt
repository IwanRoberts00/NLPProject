<I>
 I'm Mrs Chapala Nayak from Orissa and 
what's your name please 
I am Mr Mishra from Arunachal Pradesh 
I have come here for a refresher course uh means in Kolhapur
How do you enjoy it ?
I enjoy it very well but uh I thought there could
be more uh uhm programmes like guest lecturers many more guest lecturers
coming from outside 
That could have been a better programme 
Look suppose uh we are forgetting about this refresher
course how do you enjoy this place ?
This place is also is very nice
Very nice so I think that's uh
Here the weather conditions are fine and yeah
 very pleasant 
 Yeah 
In Arunachal Pradesh the conditions are totally different 
I work in Bondila 
And yesterday there was in the means T V means that uh 
there is heavy snowfall 
The temperature is always uh minus uh seven uh seven to 
seven degrees 
I take also this place for enjoyable
But uh I get a little bit of cold because I have some
sort of problem here that typical cold here uh over above all its
 okay 
That is why
Climate is so nice I think and the beautiful
sceneries are here
 You're right 
And when will we go back ?
Actually on fourth uh this refresher course is coming to
 an end 
And after that I plan to go back via Orissa to 
Arunachal Pradesh
Tickets it's uh have you reserved ?
I have got my reservations 
 No not got 
Then we may go both of us
Now that is how your husband also by that time we meet he
has requested me 
I have uh told him that I will acompany
Have you visited any other place ?
In ?
In Kolhapur ?
Yeah I went to Mahalaxmi temple 
I went to also Rankala lake I also Shalini Palace
 
 That Kolhapur city 
Why not we are making a programme that uh for Panhala I
think it's a nice place 
 Panhala we'll go uh we've 
planned it uh on next Sunday 
If you like you can join us 
I think it's a historical place 
Yes since I heard that there are forts and uh some
other things let us see yeah 
 Shivaji 
It it is mostly in the pattern of our Barwati study one
word Barwati Durg 
Yeah 
And that day in Panhala we will be able to find our
own uh past culture 
Culture of Orissa tradition of Orissa 
How do you find is it better than Orissa ?
Actually means uh every place is a good place 
We cannot say which place is better but uh to each one like his
own name sounds the sweetest the place uh where he is born
that must be the best
 Then how is it that 
How is it that that from AP the natural scenery ?
Natural scenery also see in AP that is quite good 
because that uh the government is taking much interest in developing that
into a tourist 
Is it hilly hilly area ?
Yes hilly resort 
They are going to develop it in the Sima Simla and Kashmir
type of
Then how do you feel that uh remaining far away from you
home ?
Obviously if you remain far away from your
home uh you will feel nostalgic for your home
 Next time you'll 
 Then also family 
And very often even if I like this place but uh I feel
very homesick here 
 One or two words was got to feel that but anyway 
the the call of the business is there and you have to there be there
for 
You are remembering your children family 
Certainly laughter 
And I also feel
Very often when I feel that to go and that to visit some places
here I always remember my children 
That it means they will be with us how nice it could it be
 That could be better 
I also feel
And here actually I feel that uh they are not giving us
any holidays 
And just like Makarsankranti which was uh Shiv
ceremony idea
Like in 
 one word we are going to forget it
 In Orissa 
Yeah 
Because there is no holiday 
I also thought that day we'll be getting some 
makar chawal and some other things means this all
cultural and traditional things 
 But they're observing here in a different way
 
Yeah means uh uh also I am looking food in a mess
 That some sweet they're giving 
Yeah 
And saying that 
 In the class also they gave certain sweets
That gudgudate like this
Ha right 
That is quite good also 
 This is almost seem the Simla pattern of Orissan
 This that's why I seem 
Only the variation of culture actually 
 That's what different culture 
Ha it is there
The way we observe it's different here 
And again that uh Saraswati pooja we observe there
with uh so much pomp and ceremony 
 Haan 
But here they are one word they don't know what which
Sarswati pooja 
But Ganesh pooja is different here
And in Maharashtra Ganesha is a very uhm a good uh big God
 a uhm you may be finding on the street you may be watching on
the T V 
 It may be but they're not observing
that Saraswati pooja and I feel that's 
it 
 Ha but uh every region has got it's own
Gods and Goddesses yeah and that is 
 Yeah 
No not that uh it's your own God or Goddesses 
laughter Gods and Goddesses are there everywhere 
 Natural 
But uh they by culture generally you have got
your own specific ident tified God
 They 
Yeah 
That happens and uh Vinayak is a very important God here
in Maharashtra
Uh you come Orissa when in your vacations every year
 ?
Almost every year because uh every year we are having two
vacations 
Two one actually vacation of two months summer
vacation
Summer 
And in winter we get about twenty-two days break we
call it the winter break
Do you come in both the vacations ?
Almost 
You enjoy that 
Certainly
Summer summer 
Summer actually in Orissa these days it is
becoming very hot for us after staying there in Arunachal for about 
uh say seven eighty uh seven years uh years I am finding it uh
very hot to manage in Orissa particularly during summer 
 Summer 
 What's your idea about that Konark temple ?
Konark temple
Do you find any other substitute or something equal 
in any other state ?
I think so far as Konark temple is concerned Konark is
Konark 
Uh it has got a world status uh you know it is there in
 uh the great surprises of the world 
It has been enlist enlisted that way
And so in some of the states you may be finding very good
temples like here in Maharashtra Jejuri is there on our way 
from Poona to Kolhapur from the train I had a glimpse of Jejuri
Is it so artistic ?
Jejuri ?
It may be I have not uh seen it
I have seen it only from the train I think it could be
because uh like Jayanta Mahapatra has written on Konark uh here Arun
Kolatkar has written on 
That temple
Jejuri 
But the difference between Jayant Mahapatra and Arun uhm you
can find as the people say the critics say that Jejuri is uh on
the pattern of T S Eliot's Waste Land 
It might have been but
Might have been actually we've we've not
read it so you cannot say but Konark after all it is on a
different pattern
Yeah I think so that uh it's completely
different 
 Haan 
Mainly because of uh not of that uh background on
the one side that the background or the story behind it 
We take it as that of the patriotism that about the
 It is the case of patriotism
It is a case of sacrifice
It is a case of uh a fa father's love for
his child a son's dedication for his father all
that 
 No not only 
Also you say if you go back to that 
Dharamputli Jheel 
 And it's artistic 
Ha that artistic talk I think 
Artistic talk is there certainly and uh if we go
back to that Dharamputli Jheel yeah you find
 it's all a count in search of his father 
And the father and the son then they don't get an opportunity mean
to exchange the mutual courtesies 
 Yeah 
The very eve evening the boy reaches 
The same night he constructs that uh dome completes that dome
Yeah yeah completes
And again for the sake of his own uh uh community he
sacrificies jumps from the river
But it shows
As jumps from the top of the temple and uh gets uh
buried in the 
It shows his patriotism put itself I
think 
 Put itself 
Its patriotism
But the boy is that what to be expected more than a boy
like uh Dharma of twelve years or ten to twelve years old 
Right of course it's a it it
can be different uh a differently interpreted it can be also a sign
of patriotism I think
 It 
Have you seen that Chandipur ?
Yes Chandipur I have gone Chandipur where we
have got this uh ordnance factory 
 Chandipur 
Yeah and that Gopalpur ?
Gopalpur in Barampur ?
Uhm 
That sea beach nice
Sea beach in the a few words 
 Haan one word central uh of
course the light house is a is a bit away from that 
Gopalpuri is also
No not I
Connected to our Orissa's rich past 
From there only we sailed in the long past to Japan Borneo 
some other places we hear
Then what's your idea about Chandvali ?
 One word the government is taking a lot of
interest and uh it has developed into uhm missile and 
missile the present site uh
Yeah 
But let's see
It also
There was a huge approach previously 
That there was a port 
There was a port but uh
Again they are trying that uh that to have built 
 but if it will be possible 
 But 
It may not be possible now
It may not be
In in this present condition of the 
They are trying that
Yes they may be able to do may not be able to do 
But in the left of one word and this uh ordnance
factory there 
Do you enjoy your service there ?
In Arunachal Pradesh
Yeah 
Enjoying it
How how many are there from Orissa ?
Means actually in our college there are three 
From Orissa ?
Yeah 
 I'm one then another is Mr Nayak he's
 a lecturer in History and there is another Dr Mahonty 
he's from one word but he is from Orissa 
Orissa 
He is in Political Science 
 Orissa 
Why they are so much interested and also you ?
No it's not a case of interest
Then ?
 It's uh
You got the chance how ?
You get a chance and you go because in these days of uh
 unemployment and all that you cannot just stay back at home
 and take risk 
 That's what 
No to me I I always think that uh the first chance is the
best chance 
Whenever we get no no first the chance
 No no 
And also 
 We've to abide after that we may consider
That is the prescription 
Because if you leave a chance those same chance may not come
to you again
And so far as coming to Orissa is concerned 
 And which is your in one word 
we've to do grasp it 
Once the matter if coming with Orissa is concerned you
can come back yeah anytime you like because the UGC has
uh as per the UGC scheme uh you can come to the university in a way
That way I'm looking up for a better future 
 Yeah 
That you are thinking that to come back Orissa ?
Yeah in if anytime it is possible I'll come
back 
And here in Orissa the correspondence are quiet good also
As far east organisation has come under uh actually after UGC 
recommendations have been implemented with new year we are finding the
pay scales are almost the same 
I was previously working in Kandapur college 
I started my career as a lecturer in Kandapur college itself 
in Orissa 
But in uh new the conditions in those uh days but in the
private colleges
 That's obvious problem is everywhere 
Actually I joined that uh in nineteen eighty when the
college started 
And now still now I'm there 
Uh I heard that day also actually I I matriculated in
seventy-nine 
Seventy-nine
Seventy-nine and you joined in eighty
Eighty 
That is quite nice and interesting also 
And we have four there no 
We have lot respect uh better command 
And others 
In other departments 
Yeah
No they have 
Off day that is a uh
Two to three members are there 
One wo working that the result 
Means the government has got yeah different
categories 
 Yeah 
Not that according to plus two and plus three system 
In class two they have minimised just like the clerk and
something like 
Actually in other states the pattern is different
They are not having the junior colleges 
They are having the plus two plus plus system of Indian school
 we call it as one word 
 In Orissa they have not done till date
But in Orissa even the a few words 
But they have done the bifur bifurcation in one
college plus two plus three all these systems are different
But the pay structure is quite good for them for junior
college lecturers because you find they hire secondary teacher a
senior teacher who gets uh sixteen uh sixteen forty to twenty-nine
 scale 
Whereas in Orissa you get uh means a junior college
lecturer gets uh two thousand to three thousand five hundred 
I think uh that is the second pay 
No that is not the second that is higher than
the second stage 
No now in Orissa 
So they are getting two thousand uh they are getting it
at par with the O S officers 
That means class two 
Yeah class two 
Whereas we are also class one officers 
Not actually class one
Yes class one 
There 
No we are 
No no 
There
A P 
Uhn
