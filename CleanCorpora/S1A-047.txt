<I>
""
""
""
what's 
""
""
I am 
""
I have come here for a refresher course  uh means in Kolhapur
""
""
""
How do you enjoy it  ?
""
""
I enjoy it  there could
be more uh  uhm programmes like guest lecturers many more guest lecturers
coming from outside 
""
That could have been a better 
""
""
Look  suppose uh we are forgetting about this refresher
course  ?
""
""
This place is also is very nice
""
""
Very nice so I think  uh
""
""
Here the weather  yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
In Arunachal Pradesh the conditions are totally different 
""
I work in Bondila 
""
And yesterday there was in the 
there is heavy snowfall 
""
The temperature is always 
seven degrees 
""
""
I take also this place for enjoyable
""
But uh  I have some
sort of problem here that  uh over above all its
""
""
""
That is why
""
""
Climate is so nice  and the beautiful
sceneries are here
""
""
""
""
""
And when will we go back  ?
""
""
Actually on fourth uh  this refresher course is coming to
""
""
And after that I plan to 
Arunachal Pradesh
""
""
Tickets  ?
""
""
I have 
""
""
""
""
Then we may go  both of us
""
""
Now that is how your husband also by that time we meet  he
has requested me 
""
I have uh  told him that I will acompany
""
""
Have you visited any other place  ?
""
""
In  ?
""
""
In Kolhapur  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
I went to also  I also Shalini Palace
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why not we are making a programme that uh  for Panhala I
think 
""
""
""
planned it 
""
If you like you can join us 
""
""
I think 
""
""
Yes since I heard  some
other things 
""
""
""
""
""
It it is mostly in the pattern of our Barwati study  one
word 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And that day in Panhala  our
own 
""
Culture of Orissa 
""
""
How do you find  ?
""
""
Actually means uh 
""
We cannot say which place is better but  uh to each one like his
own name sounds the sweetest  is born
that must be the best
""
""
""
""
""
How is it that that from AP  the natural scenery ?
""
""
Natural scenery also 
because that uh the government is taking much interest in developing that
into a tourist 
""
""
Is it hilly  hilly area ?
""
""
Yes hilly resort 
""
They are going to develop it in the  Simla and Kashmir
type of
""
""
Then how do you feel  that uh remaining far away from you
home  ?
""
""
Obviously  far away from your
home  for your home
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And very often even if I like this place but uh  I feel
very homesick here 
""
""
""
the the call of the business is there  be there
for 
""
""
You are remembering your 
""
""
Certainly 
""
""
And I also feel
""
Very often  when I feel that to go and that to visit some places
here 
""
That it means they will be with us  how nice it could it be
""
""
""
""
""
I also feel
""
""
And here actually  I feel that uh they are not giving us
any holidays 
""
And just like  which was uh Shiv
ceremony idea
""
""
Like in 
""
""
 forget it
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Because there is no holiday 
""
""
I also thought that day 
makar  all
cultural and traditional things 
""
""
 observing here in a different way
""
""
""
Yeah means uh  looking food in a mess
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And 
""
""
 gave certain sweets
""
""
That  like this
""
""
Ha right 
""
That is quite good also 
""
 seem the Simla pattern of Orissan
""
""
""
""
""
Only 
""
""
""
""
""
Ha it is there
""
""
The way we observe 
""
And again that uh Saraswati  we observe there
with 
""
""
""
""
""
But here they are  they don't know what which
Sarswati 
""
""
But Ganesh  is different here
""
And in Maharashtra Ganesha is a very  uhm a good uh big God
 you may be watching on
the T V 
""
""
 not observing
that Saraswati 
it 
""
""
 own
Gods and Goddesses 
""
""
""
""
""
No not that uh 
laughter 
""
""
""
""
""
But uh  by culture generally you have got
your own specific  God
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
That happens  and uh Vinayak is a very important God here
in Maharashtra
""
""
Uh you come Orissa when  every year
 ?
""
""
Almost every year because  uh every year we are having two
vacations 
""
Two  summer
vacation
""
""
Summer 
""
""
And in winter we get about twenty-two days  we
call it the winter break
""
""
Do you come in both the vacations ?
""
""
Almost 
""
""
You enjoy that 
""
""
Certainly
""
""
Summer summer 
""
""
Summer actually  it is
becoming very hot for us 
uh say seven eighty uh seven years  uh
very hot to manage 
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
Konark temple
""
""
Do you find any other substitute 
in any other state  ?
""
""
I think so far as Konark temple is concerned  Konark is
Konark 
""
Uh it has got a  uh you know it is there in
""
""
It has been  that way
""
""
And  so in some of the states you may be finding very good
temples like 
from Poona to Kolhapur  from the train I had a glimpse of Jejuri
""
""
Is it so artistic  ?
""
""
Jejuri  ?
""
It may be I have not  uh seen it
""
I have seen it only from the train  I think it could be
because uh  uh here Arun
Kolatkar has written on 
""
""
That temple
""
""
Jejuri 
""
But the difference between Jayant Mahapatra and Arun  uhm you
can find  Jejuri is uh on
the pattern of T S 
""
""
It might have been but
""
""
Might have been actually  not
read it  it is on a
different pattern
""
""
Yeah  completely
different 
""
""
""
""
""
Mainly because of  on
the one side that the background 
""
We take it as that of the patriotism  about the
""
""
""
 case of patriotism
""
It is a case of sacrifice
""
It is a case of  love for
his child  all
that 
""
""
""
""
""
Also you 
Dharamputli Jheel 
""
""
""
""
""
Ha that artistic talk I think 
""
""
Artistic talk is there certainly  if we go
back to that  you find
""
""
And the father and the son then they don't get an opportunity mean
to 
""
""
""
""
""
The 
""
The same night he constructs that  uh dome completes that dome
""
""
Yeah yeah completes
""
""
And again  uh uh community he
sacrificies  jumps from the river
""
""
But it shows
""
""
As jumps from the top of the temple and  uh gets uh
buried in the 
""
""
It shows his patriotism  I
think 
""
""
""
""
""
Its patriotism
""
""
But the boy is that what to be expected more  than a boy
like uh Dharma of twelve years or 
""
""
Right of course  it
can be different uh  it can be also a sign
of patriotism I think
""
""
""
""
""
Have you seen that Chandipur  ?
""
""
Yes Chandipur I have gone  where we
have got this uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  ?
""
""
Gopalpur in Barampur ?
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
That sea beach nice
""
""
Sea beach in the 
""
""
 uh of
course the light house is a is a bit away from that 
""
Gopalpuri is also
""
""
No not I
""
""
Connected to our 
""
From there only we sailed in the long past 
some other places we hear
""
""
Then  ?
""
""
 the government is taking a lot of
interest and 
missile  the present site uh
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But  see
""
""
It also
""
""
There was a 
""
""
That there was a port 
""
""
There was a port  but uh
""
""
Again they are trying that uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
It may not be possible now
""
""
It may not be
""
""
In in this present condition of the 
""
""
They are trying that
""
""
Yes 
""
But in the left of  uh ordnance
factory there 
""
""
Do you enjoy your service there  ?
""
""
In Arunachal Pradesh
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Enjoying it
""
""
How how many are there  ?
""
""
Means actually 
""
""
From Orissa  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
 he's
""
he's 
Orissa 
""
He is in Political Science 
""
""
""
""
""
Why they are so much interested  ?
""
""
No  not a case of interest
""
""
Then ?
""
""
 uh
""
""
You got the chance  how ?
""
""
You get a chance and you go because  in these days of uh
 at home
""
""
""
""
""
""
No to me I I always think that  uh the first chance is the
best chance 
""
Whenever we get  first the chance
""
""
""
""
""
And also 
""
""
 after that we may consider
""
""
That is the prescription 
""
Because if you  leave a chance those same chance may not come
to you again
""
And so far as coming to 
""
""
""
we've 
""
""
Once the matter if  coming with Orissa is concerned you
can come back  because the UGC has
uh  uh you can come to the university in a way
""
""
That way 
""
""
""
""
""
That you are thinking that to come back Orissa  ?
""
""
Yeah  come
back 
""
And here in Orissa the  are quiet good also
""
""
As far east organisation has come under uh actually after UGC 
recommendations have been implemented with new year  we are finding the
pay scales are 
""
I was previously working 
""
I started my career as a lecturer in Kandapur college itself 
in Orissa 
""
But in uh new the conditions in those  but in the
private colleges
""
""
""
""
Actually I joined that  when the
college started 
""
And now 
""
""
Uh I heard that day also actually I  I matriculated in
seventy-nine 
""
""
Seventy-nine
""
""
Seventy-nine and  you joined in eighty
""
""
Eighty 
""
""
That is quite nice 
""
""
And we have 
""
We have lot 
""
""
And others 
""
""
In other departments 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
No they have 
""
""
Off day  that is a uh
""
""
Two to three members are there 
""
One 
""
""
Means the government has got  different
categories 
""
""
""
""
""
Not that according to plus two and plus three system 
""
In class two  and
something like 
""
""
Actually  the pattern is different
""
""
They are not having the 
""
They are having the plus two plus plus system of Indian  school
""
""
""
 till date
""
""
But in Orissa even the 
""
""
But they have done the  in one
college plus two plus three  all these systems are different
""
""
But the pay structure is quite good for them  for junior
college lecturers  a
senior teacher  uh sixteen uh sixteen forty to twenty-nine
""
""
Whereas  means a junior college
lecturer gets uh 
""
""
I think uh that is the 
""
""
No that is not the  that is higher than
the 
""
""
No now in Orissa 
""
""
So they are getting two thousand  uh they are getting it
at par with the 
""
""
That means class two 
""
""
Yeah class two 
""
Whereas we are also class one officers 
""
""
Not actually class one
""
""
Yes 
""
""
There 
""
""
No we are 
""
""
No no 
""
""
There
""
""
A P 
""
""
Uhn
