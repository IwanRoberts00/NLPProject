<I>
Whatever may it goes I think people have to accept it
Uhm 
Incidently haan ho 
how is the disturbance in your part about Dandia 
 Haan 
No there are no such celebrations here
Yours is the perfectly peaceful residential area
It appears because 
Ah 
Uh are there any in Rajarampuri ?
The they are there are in Rajarampuri
 Accha so everything is really
No no not in the area where I am staying
Ah 
So 
I think Sykes Extension there is a photograph in 
today's Sakal 
 Accha 
Uh I think there are many enthusiasts there 
Ah but they didn't have the uh requirement of getting up
early next mo morning and going for work
 Same thing 
Ah 
So they can relax 
Today is a holiday 
Ah 
But I think this has been going on for the past few
days 
That that is for all 
 It'll continue I think till the uh
end of the festival
Yes from first that is the from pratipada
 to navmi 
 Haan 
And Dasara is the tenth
day
Right right 
So
So does it go on for all the ten days ?
Yes 
Ahm
Uhm it start from Navratra first day
Ahm 
Then you go on upto tenth Dasara 
is tenth 
 Even if the 
I think in yesterdays or day before uhm there was
an article in the Times 
 Uhm 
Yes yes yes yes 
 What's in it 
How I mean noisy and uh the spirit behind it has been lost
Completly
And it has now become you see more or less uh a
commercialized uh laughter all sorts of things can take place
Ahn and you know it's an excellant opportunity to
see girls
Right right
Mix with girls you're right and girls
 I mean from the families where you would probably not be able to pick
your say nose also
 You're right 
Right right
So that is and unfortunate part of it is the community
which you supposed to have this kind of skill ahn is
 not uh aware of the risk that it involves right 
in exposing the members of the senior members of this family
 Ahn 
 Right 
 Perhaps you see 
We have been pushed into the background ahn
 others have taken over it 
 Ahn 
Ahn that's what it seems now 
 It it appears 
And nahi also it got mixed up
with you see western thought laughter culture kinds of
you see entertainment
 Nahi 
With their tiparies in their hand they have
all those western dances 
 Uhn 
But you accepted
Uhn 
That indeed there is no longer you see either religious or
devotional like it seems to have lost its meaning altogether
That is that is but then the I don't mind if it has
lost meaning to those people themselves
Ahn 
You know it's certainly disturbing to the others
Right right 
It goes on till three two or three in the morning 
 And 
And the the Times Of India report says
that the decibels are hundred haan which is 
which is very high pitch 
 Haan 
Right 
A nine tunnel truck laughter you see as we see it
on our Highway in front of our college ahn everyday when
we engage the classes 
 Ahn 
 Yes yes 
Hardly anything can be heard you see whenever uh if the
vehicles pass uhm through at the same time 
 Uhm 
That is true
You know we can't help it 
But fortunately in Nagala Park there is no such disturbance
And you should be really pleased with it
Correct 
How is Akshay ?
Nice he is
Ahn
 It's a holiday for him today 
Ah ha
So he's at home 
 Accha 
He was not well for quite sometime
Really ?
Yes 
What was it ?
I don't know I see he hasn't got an appetite that is
 that seems to be his main trouble
I see 
Uh either he has no appetite haan
 or has I mean becomes so I mean angry at times 
 Haan 
Ah ha 
Over himself 
I think he must be very playful that is one of the reason
 He's of course playful
Ah if he is playful you know they just forget
Right 
Ah very often that they have to eat and suddenly when 
they feel very uncomfortable they start crying
And we were all you see 
 And don't realize 
For a fortnight
Uhm 
Uh on a tour for South India
Oh I see ah ha
Perhaps that too is a strain you see
Uhm correct 
So after his return uh he wasn't well for a day or
two
I see 
But now he seems fine 
 Fine accha uhn 
Incidently I hope you know 
Uhn 
I lost my dog 
 Achha yeah sorry 
 Yeah 
Uh I mean what brought about the the end ?
Nothing it was just a natural death 
out of old age 
 Maybe I think 
 Old age 
You see 
Yes 
Ah 
See after a particular stage ah as it happens
in case of uh man
 Ah 
Yes yes of course any living thing you see 
Ah any living thing
There are there're 
The process of degeneration start 
Yes everything has yes come to an end
 Yes 
Yes 
Then how did you I mean dispose it off 
Uh we buried him in our uh compound 
 Ah ha 
 That's what I too thought 
Yes 
I had I had I I had invited a pe vet 
ah about a month back
 Ah 
Right 
And then I just sought his advice because you know I had
earlier gone to Dagade 
Ah 
Dagade I mean just out of curiosity I said look
here if you don't mind I would like you to tell me something about this
Ah 
And we just settled on one point that is China
Ah 
Because that is the one which can 
 Yes yes you told me that you had been
to China and there you
 Yes haan 
So he was just kept on it 
In the meanwhile I he say Dr Dagade adviced me 
 haan that I should get uh the vet 
 haan and seek his opinion 
 Haan 
 Haan 
So that we will be able to diagnose what is the
problem ?
I see 
So he came uh and he said sir I think this is
just old age 
Ah 
And I was not very much interested in torturing him at
 this age 
 Right ah 
So I just went on feeding him whatever usual milk 
 you take 
 That's right 
And uh a ju just allowed him to be 
 that's right the way he can live 
 That's right 
Sick people will be 
Ah nursing of it was necessary for a 
 the last fortnight 
Ah 
Because I had to clean him ah every 
uh twice a day and then every other day I had to give him a sort of a uh
uh sponge bath or something like that 
 Ah 
But uh that was only for about a fortnight and the
end was damn peaceful
Ah 
Even the earlier night he was alright because the last one uh
 four days I think ah all that he could have life was
in his eyes 
 Ah 
Ah 
 Cough 
He keep kept looking at us 
So you just found him I mean dead or 
Uh no 
It just happened ah that the earlier whole
day he was a bit uncomfortable moving sides 
perhaps shifting sides 
 Ah 
 Ah ha 
 Perhaps 
Uh there were indications
Uh no but then that was a sense of activity also
Ah 
Then the evening which he lived and then we put him
in a small kind of a cradel like thing that I have got done for him
Ah 
And uh then twice or thrice that night I went to him 
saw him ah breathing normally
 Ah 
Ah
But one thing I didn't like was that he had not changed his
position in which he was kept
Ah 
And then early morning I went to him to to find out
what is to be done for him and then whether he needs cleaning ah
 whether he needs water 
 Ah 
Ah 
He was breathing 
Ah 
Then I went there and he just had a sort of a something
like he uh a few words in Kannada 
Ah 
 A few words in Kannada 
He must have just slept
Ah he just ha he just belched once ah ah
 without anything coming out of it it was dry thing
 Ah ah 
Ah 
And uh then he did it again a bit of it
 Just belched 
 Haan 
And then
That was the end
That was the end 
So when I was very much in front of him ah he just
slowily reduced his breathing 
 Ah 
 When did it happened 
Ah 
When did it happened ?
This was on Saturday morning
Saturday it's about almost a week 
Ah yes because on Saturday I was on leave 
Ah 
But have you bought another pup ?
Well I don't have
Ah
We have yet to think of it
We have not given any thought to that ah let us
see
 Ah 
Because you need it you see 
Yeah we need it 
 Of course you have been 
We need it but 
 It is a necessity 
But Prof Goud there is other part of it also
Ah 
It involves certain amount of attention and other things
Yes that is true 
Ah so 
But then the you see purpose why you kept
 John for him so long 
 Yes 
Right
Ah 
So but I I also sometimes no feels guilty about him
Ah
In the sense I had to keep him chained 
right or keep him indoors ah and then I felt well 
was I doing a right thing ?
 Right 
 Ah 
Yes yes
Now once I had it him haan 
 I had no option
 Haan 
Right 
And you could not uh change his habits 
After having uh 
 I see 
Ah 
Let him out and I mean wander about freely 
No that's no no that was not very easy but
with difficulty I could have done it
But then the trouble was he was kept indoors when he was
strong and he could fight others
Ah 
Now at a later age when he was not so strong
Ah 
And perhaps he could not fight with other dogs 
 right or tear them
 Right 
Ahn 
Then exposing him to lot of unknown or stray dogs
Right 
And inviting infections for himself and for us
 Right 
Ah 
Was not very desirable
Uh 
So that queston is at the moment not taken into
account
It is left entirely to Veena and therefore I'm 
not thinking about it 
She must have come back yesterday or
Yeah she came last night 
She came last night 
And what about Vishvas has he 
Vishvas has gone to Hyderabad now
 Transfered 
Ah ah 
With his wife 
Ah so he's posted there or ?
No he's not
He has for the first time gone for his divisional training 
 ahn and the divisional training is supposed to be in his own
division
 Ahn 
Right right 
So since Hyderabad he's supposed to be his
division ah South Central 
 Ah 
Ah 
He has gone there and then he rang up
Ah 
He just told us that he will be uh back here
somewhere on thirteenth or fourteenth 
 One word 
Uh 
 That's his zonal head quarters 
Zonal head Hyderabad is zonal head quarters 
Ah incidently ah uh in your college 
 uhn is there any possibility of finding a trustworthy painter
 ?
 Ah 
 Uhn 
Painters you mean 
Painting the house 
Uh yes I'll I'll try you see 
No I mean I just
 I'll tell you somebody
Ah 
Ah 
I mean a man whom you know and who happens to be a student
and he has been in the college for few ahn
 Ahn ha 
I think even in painting ahn uh some
students have done a course in the I T I
 Ahn 
Really 
I remember because ah I asked them causally
you see 
Ah ha 
They come to me for admission or for one word 
Ah you meet every student 
Ah everyone who comes to me 
So they tell me you see uhm what I mean 
training they have had and or what job they do 
 Uhm 
Uhn
And all I mean sorts of skilled hands are there
Ahn
Even including masons are there laughter for
actually I mean working as masons 
 I see really
Or undertraining you see 
I see 
Because if some some of them 
Uhn
They are children of masons 
Ah ha
