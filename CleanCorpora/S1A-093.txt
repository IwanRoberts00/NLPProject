<I>
""
""
Whatever may it goes I think people have to accept it
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Incidently 
how is the disturbance in your part about 
""
""
""
""
""
No there are no  celebrations here
""
""
Yours is the perfectly peaceful residential area
""
""
It appears because 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Uh  ?
""
""
The they are there are in Rajarampuri
""
""
 so everything is really
""
""
No no not in the area where I am staying
""
""
Ah 
""
""
So 
""
""
I think Sykes Extension there is a photograph in 
today's 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Ah but they didn't have the  uh requirement of getting up
early next  work
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
So they can relax 
""
""
Today is a holiday 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
But I think  past few
days 
""
""
That that is 
""
""
 uh
end of the festival
""
""
Yes from first  pratipada
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  is the tenth
day
""
""
Right right 
""
""
So
""
""
So does it go on for all the ten days ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Ahm
""
""
Uhm  first day
""
""
Ahm 
""
""
Then you go on upto tenth 
is tenth 
""
""
""
""
I think in yesterdays or day before  there was
an article in the 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
How I mean noisy and uh  the spirit behind it has been lost
""
""
Completly
""
""
And it has now become you see  a
commercialized uh  all sorts of things can take place
""
""
Ahn and  an excellant opportunity to
see girls
""
""
Right right
""
""
Mix with girls  and girls
 I mean from the families where you would probably not be able to pick
your  say nose also
""
""
""
""
""
Right right
""
""
So that is  the community
which  is
""
in exposing  senior members of this family
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We have been pushed  ahn
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
""
""
""
And  also it got mixed up
with  kinds of
you see entertainment
""
""
""
""
""
With their  in their hand they have
all those western 
""
""
""
""
""
But you accepted
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
That indeed there is no longer you see  either religious or
devotional  like it seems to have lost its meaning altogether
""
""
That is  I don't mind if it has
lost meaning to those people themselves
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
You know  certainly disturbing to the others
""
""
Right right 
""
It 
""
""
""
""
""
And the the  report says
that the decibels are hundred 
which is very high pitch 
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
A nine tunnel truck  as we see it
on our  everyday when
we engage 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Hardly anything can be heard you see whenever  uh if the
vehicles pass 
""
""
""
""
""
That is true
""
""
You know 
""
But fortunately  there is no such disturbance
""
""
""
And you should be really  pleased with it
""
""
Correct 
""
""
How is  Akshay ?
""
""
Nice he is
""
""
Ahn
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
He was not well for quite sometime
""
""
Really  ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
What was it  ?
""
""
I don't know I see he  that is
 main trouble
""
""
I see 
""
""
Uh either he  haan
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
Over himself 
""
""
I think he must be very playful that is one of the reason
""
""
 of course playful
""
""
Ah  if he is playful you know they just forget
""
""
Right 
""
""
Ah very often that they have to eat and suddenly when 
they feel very uncomfortable they start crying
""
""
And we were all 
""
""
""
""
""
For a fortnight
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uh  on a tour for South India
""
""
Oh I see  ah ha
""
""
Perhaps that too is a  strain you see
""
""
Uhm correct 
""
""
So after his return  day or
two
""
""
I see 
""
""
But now he seems 
""
""
""
""
Incidently I hope you know 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
I lost my dog 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh I mean what brought about the  ?
""
""
Nothing 
out of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You see 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
See after a particular stage  as it happens
in case of  uh man
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes of course 
""
""
Ah any living thing
""
""
There are 
""
""
The process of degeneration start 
""
""
Yes everything has  come to an end
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Then how did you I mean 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
I had I had 
ah  about a month back
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
And then  I just sought his advice because you know I had
earlier gone to Dagade 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Dagade  look
here if you don't mind I would like you to  tell me something about this
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And  China
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Because that is the one which 
""
""
 been
to China  and there you
""
""
""
""
""
So he was just kept on it 
""
In the meanwhile I 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So that  what is the
problem  ?
""
""
I see 
""
""
So he came  sir I think this is
just 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And  I was not very much interested in torturing him at
""
""
""
""
""
""
So I just went on 
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sick people will be 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Because I had to 
uh twice a day and then every other day I had to give him a sort of a  uh
uh sponge bath or something like that 
""
""
""
""
""
But uh  and the
end was damn peaceful
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Even the earlier night he was alright because the last one uh
 life was
in his eyes 
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
""
""
He 
""
""
So you just 
""
""
Uh no 
""
It just happened  whole
day 
perhaps 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh there were indications
""
""
Uh  a sense of activity also
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Then the  and then we put him
in a small  kind of a cradel like thing that I have got done for him
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And uh 
saw him  breathing normally
""
""
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
But one thing I didn't like was that he had not changed his
position in which he was kept
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And then  to to find out
what is to be done for him and then whether he needs cleaning  ah
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
He was breathing 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Then I went there  and he just had a sort of a something
like he uh 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
""
""
""
He must have just slept
""
""
Ah he just  ah ah
 it was dry thing
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And uh  a bit of it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then
""
""
That was the end
""
""
That was the end 
""
So when I was very much in front of him  he just
slowily reduced 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
When did it happened  ?
""
""
This was on Saturday morning
""
""
Saturday 
""
""
Ah yes 
""
""
Ah 
""
But have you  ?
""
""
Well I don't have
""
""
Ah
""
""
We have yet to  think of it
""
We have not given any thought to that  let us
see
""
""
""
""
""
Because you 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
We need 
""
""
""
""
""
But Prof Goud there is other part of it also
""
""
Ah 
""
""
It involves certain amount of attention and other things
""
""
Yes that is true 
""
""
Ah so 
""
""
But then the  kept
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right
""
""
Ah 
""
""
So  but I I also sometimes no feels guilty about him
""
""
Ah
""
""
In the sense 
right 
was I doing a right thing  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
Now once 
 I had no option
""
""
""
""
""
Right 
""
""
And you could not uh 
""
After having 
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Let him out 
""
""
No  but
with difficulty I could have done it
""
But then the trouble was  he was kept indoors when he was
strong and he could fight others
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Now at a later age when he was not so strong
""
""
Ah 
""
""
And perhaps he could not fight 
 or tear them
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
Then exposing him to lot of unknown or stray dogs
""
""
Right 
""
""
And inviting infections for  and for us
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Was not very  desirable
""
""
Uh 
""
""
So  at the moment not taken into
account
""
It is left entirely to Veena 
not 
""
""
She must have come back yesterday or
""
""
Yeah she came last night 
""
She came last night 
""
""
And 
""
""
Vishvas has gone to  now
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ah 
""
""
With his wife 
""
""
Ah  ?
""
""
No  not
""
He has for the first time 
 in his own
division
""
""
""
""
""
Right right 
""
""
So  supposed to be his
division 
""
""
""
""
""
Ah 
""
""
He has gone there and then he rang up
""
""
Ah 
""
""
He just told us  uh back here
somewhere on thirteenth or fourteenth 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Zonal head 
""

""

I think even in painting  some
students have done a course in the I T I
""
