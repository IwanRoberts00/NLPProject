What I wanted to look at was all communication between
different workers in industries at different levels in various
organisations 
Uh and I was looking at
I wanted to look at in fact I was interested in looking at both
 the reported use of in uh English in industries and 
uh the actual use of uh English in industries 
Uh because I thought there would be a difference 
What you imagine you use is not always what you actually use
Uh you imagine you use a particular language but when you
 uh when you are observed you find that there is or you
observe yourself you find that you are in fact not actually using
what you thought or what you imagined you use uh in different contexts
with different people for different purposes 
So I thought I would study both the aspects and compare the two 
Unfortunately for me I was not allowed to record anything at
all in industries because for uh they felt that for security
reasons they could not allow tape recorders on to 
campus
Now this is one of the disadvantages this is one of the
constraints under which I was working 
So I thought well I confine myself to reported use only 
And how did I go about this uhm well I thought I would
select industries in Andhra Pradesh that is uh for no other reason
except that I work there and I thought it would be easy for me to have
access to various industries in Andhra Pradesh 
Now how was I to decide which industries I should take up for
 my study 
Uh it would be difficult to decide and it was difficult to decide
initially 
Then I thought I would look at uh a comparatively uh
industrially advanced area industrially advanced area and a sta
 uh uh uh a district that was industrially backward so that I would
have the two extremes uh uh for my study 
Uh ju for that reason I said okay
Hyderabad is industrially more advanced and Karnool district is
industrially backward 
So I took up these two districts the industries in these
two districts for my study cough 
Now what kind of study was I going to get a
representative industrial population from that again was very difficult
for me to decide 
Uh finally I did some reading I uh did a bit of study 
I tried to find out get information about the kind of industries
one could have
And I broadly classified these industries and there there
is a classification available uh in the literature uh into public
sector undertaking and private sector undertaking undertaking 
that was the main classification 
And then the other factor that I thought might affect 
the use of language uh was location of industry 
And this was very convenient for me to do because Karnool
district being backward had a large number of rural industries 
Now let me explain what I mean by rural 
 I by rural I don't mean a completely rural area 
because that would be contradictory in terms
You can't have an industry where you don't have the
infrastructure for for an industry 
So let us say by rural I meant very small towns or 
uhm probably you would understand Taluk better at
the subdivision levels 
So uh I classified my industries and I selected
industries from Hyderabad public and private
And then Hyderabad provided me with the urban sector and
 uhm Karnool with rural industries 
Then I decided on how I was going to collect this data 
And uh since I had to I was almost compelled to 
look at only reported use I had to think about how I was going to go
about uh collecting data for reported use of English 
Uh when I say English uh please don't imagine that I forgot
about the Indian languages 
I always looked at the use of English vis a vis
 the Indian languages that the employees there uh in these
industries were using 
Now as far as methodology is concerned I thought I would go
about it by first of all observing what went on in these
industries 
So general uh observation and I followed this up by a
questionnaire and I refined my questionnaire as I went along on the
basis of the observation cough 
After my informants filled in the questionnaire I went about
interviewing some of them
I couldn't have interviewed uh all the informants because I
had nearly four hundred informants 
But I uh took a fairly large population and uh and
therefore I was able to uhm interview quite a large number of
informants 
Uh having collected the questionnaire I would look at their
responses and then base my interviews on the basis of those uh uh 
of their answers to my questions 
One to check whether they were aware of what they had 
answered they were aware of the reasons for their answers 
Also to check whether they had in fact read the
questionnaire carefully and uh had answered these correctly
Some of them in fact it turned out that some of them in fact
were not aware of what they have done
They had just put ticks and 
crosses uh for the sake of completing the
questionnaire 
So I had to do that to cross check to make sure that they did
fill in the questionnaires 
When uh I uh analysed this I'm I am saying all
this very briefly because I wouldn't like to go into detail 
I analysed uh these questionnaires the uh all that
I have collected and also uh recorded my observations of
their behaviour 
And I tried to look at the association or the relationship
 between the use their use of English with their
 superiors equals and their juniors and relation 
to the social variables 
That is the relationship between their use of English with 
superiors with equals and juniors and with the social variables 
type of industry that is either public or private location of
industry that is urban and rural 
Occupation and for occupation I had the uh higher
level middle level and lower level of occupation 
Education again I had the higher level middle level and
low level of education 
Medium of instruction in school 
And I had I I I chose medium of instruction in school
because that is where the the main differences is some people have
English and some people have a regional languages or Indian languages 
And exposure to English that is whether they in fact 
were exposed to a lot of English as far as their reading was concerned
 magazines journals
Now this would also be uh I I predicted that this would be uh
related to their jobs as well 
Depending on what their job was they would probably read the
kind of literature that they needed for their jobs as well 
Now in addition to this I also looked at their attitudes 
And I must admit I found it very difficult to assess their
attitudes 
I did get some uh uh a rough idea of what there attitudes were
Uh and I ag again related these
attitudes their attitudes to English to the the variables that I had
taken up earlier type and location of industries occupation education
 medium of instruction exposure to English 
Uh now cough from my analysis of the
questionnaire and on the basis of my observation of their behaviour 
on the basis of my interviews uh these were the uh the
conclusions I drew 
The most general general conclusion that I drew was that
 these people who are professionals who work in these
industries had a very functional professional attitude to
the use of English 
They don't have a political bias at all 
They are not bothered about whether the language ought to be
taught or introduced at school or college or not except 
when a except uh uh they would be bothered of course ex only
when they were uh they considered the utility of that language for
their profession 
They felt that they needed English for certain
purposes 
They needed English to talk to uh their superiors for
instance 
Now looking at the variables I found that the
location of industry was a very very important variable as far
as the uh use of English was concerned 
It was a very important variable which affected the use of
English 
Employees in rural industries for example specially those 
who had to deal with handloom for instance who had to deal with
spinning and weaving and who use only indigenous uh technology 
did not need the use of English as much as did those who used foreign
technology 
And in fact their view on this was that they 
as long as they were uh they were not as advanced as the
western countries and uh one of them used the word begging-bowl 
They had to use this begging-bowl for technology and knowledge
They would be compelled to use those languages 
that helped them to have access to science and technology to all
knowledge that would help them to uh adva uh to uh to be
industrially advanced that was their view about the use of English
Now the other the the the other variable that I found was
very important was interlocutors that is those uh they the use of
English depended on whether an employee was conversing with his
superior equal or junior 
And more English naturally was used while conversing with superiors
Another variable that was important was occupation
This was another important variable that affected the use of 
language and that also included the nature of their job 
Those who were highly technically qualified naturally needed to
talk about technical matters more than those who were dealing for
instance with administration who were not directly concerned with
production 
Those who were directly concerned with production used much
more English and felt they needed much more English because their job
required them to use more English than those who dealt with administrative
matters there were for instance the personnel branch where
they had to deal even with the with uh with all those workers from
the shop-floor for whom they had to provide say even things like uniforms
and shoes 
Now they did not need English to converse with 
those uh with with workers from the shop-floor and doors
So they needed to use English much less than those who were 
technically highly technically qualified and uh were required to
discuss technical matters 
Uh the another another factor that affected English a
great deal the use of English a great deal was context 
This was a very important uh factor which affected the use
of English 
Uh formerly for instance when they were at a meeting and
I sat in them some of their meetings 
When they were uhm talking to customers from outside 
when they were at the office doing their daily work and transactions 
they tended to use much more English than they did when they were
say at a social get together 
I attended some of their social get togethers and I found 
that their get togethers were much more relaxed much more informal 
and therefore there was less and less use of English more and more 
use of Indian languages 
Uh uh I am afraid I coudn't quantify the exact uh uh use of
English and versus the Indian languages but I can only say that
there was a client English at the level of formality and this as we
went down to more and more informal levels uh became more and
more minus English and more and more plus Indian languages 
And also their attitudes as I said earlier their attitudes
to uh the use of English uh were all based on the need for
English the various functions they had to perform and they felt 
that if a language helps them to do the job well well that was the
language they were going to use they were not bothered about whether it had a
prestige value or not 
For them it was uh and some of them in fact said 
sometimes it was an Indian language that uh works as a lubricant they
call it a lubricant if they wanted to uh get a job done they
would suddenly switch over to their uh to their mother tongue
 or to the local language 
They they didn't bother about whether it was their mother tongue
 certainly not which ever language they thought they could 
 effect effectively communicate in was
used between them 
And of course most of them felt that English was very
essential for science and technology 
Now this is very interesting
It was very essential for an individual's job
opportunities and success at work 
It was very essential for interstate communication 
It was not at all essential for English at home for
for communication at home 
Uh about English for education it is interesting to note that
 they had uh different views some of them felt that 
we should have English all the way so that all the sections of the
people would get uh fair opportunity to learn the language 
And therefore go up the social scale and also uh uh get
more opportunities for work and for jobs 
Uh some of them felt that there was no need to learn English at uh
uh upto primary school at the primary level because we should be we
should give our children more opportunities to learn our own 
languages Indian languages 
Some of them felt that English should be introduced only
 uh after middle school 
They they felt that there was no need to do to introduce
English and after middle school too it should be taught only as a
subject upto high school 
And it was only uh they were all of course unanimous in saying
that English should be introduced only at the college level as a medium of
instruction 
So these are some of the as if the the findings of the
study I haven't gone into very great detail because that would have
taken me the whole day almost 
Uh these are some of the interesting findings that we uh
that uh I came up with at uh at the end of the the the study
