What I wanted to look at was  between
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh 
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Unfortunately for me  anything at
""
""
campus
""
""
constraints 
""
So I thought 
""
""
select industries in Andhra Pradesh  for no other reason
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh  okay
""
industrially backward 
""
So I took up  the industries in these
two districts 
""
""
representative industrial population from  that again was very difficult
for me to decide 
""
Uh finally I did some reading 
""
I tried to find out get information about the kind of industries
""
""
And  and there there
is a classification available  uh into public
""
that was 
""
""
the use of language 
""
And this was very convenient for me to do  because Karnool
district being backward had a large number of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the subdivision levels 
""
""
industries from Hyderabad  and private
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh in these
""
""
Now as far as methodology is concerned I thought  I would go
about it  in these
industries 
""
So general uh  by a
questionnaire  and I refined my questionnaire as I went along on the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
answered 
""
""
""
""
""
were not aware of what they have done
""
They had just put 
""
questionnaire 
""
So I had to do that to cross check  to make sure that they did
fill in 
""
When uh  I am saying all
""
""
""
I have collected and  of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
superiors 
""
industry 
""
""
""
""
""
low level of education 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this would also be uh I I predicted that this would be  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
taken up earlier type and location of industries  education
""
""
Uh  of the
""
""
conclusions 
""
""
""
""
""
""
They don't have 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
purposes 
""
""
instance 
""
Now  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
as long as they were  as the
western countries 
""
They had to use this begging-bowl  for technology and knowledge
""
""
""
""
""
industrially advanced  the use of English
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And more English naturally was used while conversing with superiors
""
""
""
""
This was another important variable that affected the use of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the shop-floor  for whom they had to provide say even things like uniforms
""
""
Now 
""
""
""
technically  and uh were required to
discuss technical matters 
""
Uh  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
when they were at the office doing their daily work and transactions 
""
say at a social get together 
""
""
that their get togethers were much more relaxed 
""
use of Indian languages 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
English 
""
language they were going to use they were not bothered about whether it had a
""
""
""
""
call it a lubricant  they
would suddenly switch over  to their mother tongue
""
""
They they didn't bother about whether it was their mother tongue
""
""
used between them 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh about English for education  it is interesting to note that
""
we should have English all the way  so that all the sections of the
""
""
And therefore go up the social  uh uh get
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They they felt that there was no need to  introduce
""
subject upto high school 
""
""
that English should be introduced only at the college level as a medium of
""
""
So these are some of the  findings of the
""
""
""
Uh these are some of the interesting findings that  uh
