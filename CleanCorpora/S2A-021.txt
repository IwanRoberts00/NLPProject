What I wanted to look at was  between
different workers in industries at different levels  various
organisations 
""
Uh  and I was looking at
""
I wanted to look at in fact I was interested in looking at  both
""
uh 
""
Uh 
""
What you imagine you use  what you actually use
""
""
Uh  but when you
 you find that there is or you
observe yourself  actually using
what you thought or what you imagined you use  uh in different contexts
with different people for different purposes 
""
So I thought I would study both the aspects and compare the two 
""
Unfortunately for me  anything at
all  for uh they felt that for security
reasons 
campus
""
Now this is one of the disadvantages  this is one of the
constraints 
""
So I thought 
""
And how did I go about this  I thought I would
select industries in Andhra Pradesh  for no other reason
except that I work  there and I thought it would be easy for me to have
access to various industries in Andhra Pradesh 
""
Now how was I to decide  which industries I should take up for
""
""
Uh it would be difficult to decide and it was difficult to decide
initially 
""
Then I thought  uh
industrially advanced area  sta
 a district that was industrially backward so that I would
have the two extremes 
""
Uh  okay
Hyderabad is industrially more advanced  is
industrially backward 
""
So I took up  the industries in these
two districts 
""
Now what kind of  a
representative industrial population from  that again was very difficult
for me to decide 
""
Uh finally I did some reading 
""
I tried to find out get information about the kind of industries
one could have
""
And  and there there
is a classification available  uh into public
sector undertaking 
that was 
""
And then the other 
the use of language 
""
And this was very convenient for me to do  because Karnool
district being backward had a large number of 
""
Now let me explain what I mean by rural 
""
""
because that would be contradictory in terms
""
You can't have an industry  where you don't have the
infrastructure for 
""
So let us say 
uhm  at
the subdivision levels 
""
So uh  selected
industries from Hyderabad  and private
""
And then Hyderabad  and
""
""
Then I decided on how I was going to collect this data 
""
And uh 
look at only reported use  how I was going to go
about 
""
Uh when I say English  forgot
about the Indian languages 
""
I always looked at the use of English  vis a vis
 uh in these
industries were using 
""
Now as far as methodology is concerned I thought  I would go
about it  in these
industries 
""
So general uh  by a
questionnaire  and I refined my questionnaire as I went along on the
basis of the observation 
""
After  my informants filled in the questionnaire I went about
interviewing  some of them
""
I couldn't have interviewed  all the informants because I
had nearly four hundred informants 
""
But I  and
therefore  of
informants 
""
Uh  I would look at their
responses and then base my interviews 
of their answers to my questions 
""
One 
answered 
""
Also  read the
questionnaire carefully  had answered these correctly
""
Some of them  in fact it turned out that some of them in fact
were not aware of what they have done
""
They had just put 
crosses  completing the
questionnaire 
""
So I had to do that to cross check  to make sure that they did
fill in 
""
When uh  I am saying all
this very briefly because I wouldn't like to go into detail 
""
I analysed  all that
I have collected and  of
their behaviour 
""
And I tried to look at  or the relationship
 their
""
to 
""
That is the relationship between their use of English with 
superiors 
type  location of
industry 
""
Occupation  higher
level middle level and lower level of occupation 
""
Education again  and
low level of education 
""
Medium of instruction in school 
""
And  I chose medium of instruction in school
because that is where  some people have
English and some people have 
""
And 
were exposed to a lot of English  as far as their reading was concerned
 journals
""
Now this would also be uh I I predicted that this would be  uh
related to their jobs as well 
""
Depending on  what their job was they would probably read the
kind of literature that they needed for their jobs as well 
""
Now in addition to this 
""
And I must admit I found it very difficult to assess their
attitudes 
""
I did get some  uh uh a rough idea of what there attitudes were
""
""
Uh and I  related these
attitudes their attitudes to English  to the the variables that I had
taken up earlier type and location of industries  education
""
""
Uh  of the
questionnaire 
on the basis of my interviews  uh the
conclusions 
""
The most general  that
 who work in these
industries  to
the use of English 
""
They don't have 
""
They are not bothered about  whether the language ought to be
taught 
when a except uh uh  only
when  uh they considered the utility of that language for
their profession 
""
They felt  for certain
purposes 
""
They needed English  uh their superiors for
instance 
""
Now  the
location of industry  as far
as 
""
It was a very important variable  which affected the use of
English 
""
Employees in rural industries for example 
who had to deal  who had to deal with
spinning and weaving 
did not need the use of English  as much as did those who used foreign
technology 
""
And 
as long as they were  as the
western countries 
""
They had to use this begging-bowl  for technology and knowledge
""
""
They would 
that helped them to have access to  to all
knowledge that would help them to  to be
industrially advanced  the use of English
""
""
Now  the the the other variable that I found was
very important  uh they the use of
English  conversing with his
superior 
""
And more English naturally was used while conversing with superiors
""
""
Another variable that was important was occupation
""
This was another important variable that affected the use of 
language 
""
Those who were highly technically qualified naturally needed to
talk about technical matters  more than those who were dealing for
instance  administration who were not directly concerned with
production 
""
Those who were directly concerned with production  used much
more English  because their job
required them to use more English than those who dealt with administrative
matters  where
they had to deal even with the  from
the shop-floor  for whom they had to provide say even things like uniforms
and shoes 
""
Now 
those uh with with  workers from the shop-floor and doors
""
So they needed to use English much less than those who were 
technically  and uh were required to
discuss technical matters 
""
Uh  a
great deal the use of English a great deal was context 
""
This was a very important  which affected the use
of English 
""
Uh  and
I sat in them some of their meetings 
""
When they were 
when they were at the office doing their daily work and transactions 
they tended to use much more English  when they were
say at a social get together 
""
I attended some of their social get togethers 
that their get togethers were much more relaxed 
and therefore there was less and less use of English 
use of Indian languages 
""
Uh uh I am afraid I coudn't quantify  uh uh use of
English  versus the Indian languages but I can only say that
there was a client  and this as we
went down to more and more  more and
more minus English 
""
And also their attitudes  their attitudes
to  the need for
English 
that if a language  well that was the
language they were going to use they were not bothered about whether it had a
prestige value or not 
""
For them 
sometimes it was an Indian language that uh  they
call it a lubricant  they
would suddenly switch over  to their mother tongue
""
""
They they didn't bother about whether it was their mother tongue
""
 was
used between them 
""
And of course  was very
essential for science and technology 
""
Now this is very interesting
""
It was very essential for an  job
opportunities and success at work 
""
It was very essential for interstate communication 
""
It was  for
for communication at home 
""
Uh about English for education  it is interesting to note that
""
we should have English all the way  so that all the sections of the
people 
""
And therefore go up the social  uh uh get
more opportunities for work and for jobs 
""
Uh some of them felt that there was no need to learn English at uh
uh upto primary school at the primary level  we
should give our children more opportunities 
languages 
""
Some of them felt  only
""
""
They they felt that there was no need to  introduce
English  it should be taught only as a
subject upto high school 
""
And it was only  uh they were all of course unanimous in saying
that English should be introduced only at the college level as a medium of
instruction 
""
So these are some of the  findings of the
study  because that would have
taken me the whole day almost 
""
Uh these are some of the interesting findings that  uh
that uh
