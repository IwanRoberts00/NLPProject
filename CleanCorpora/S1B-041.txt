 over fifteen thousand primary health centres
and sub-centres in the country 
""
""
located scattered throughout the country 
""
Life expectancy has gone up from thirty-six  to around fifty-six
""
Today 
""
Plague and small-pox have been eradicated 
""
Malaria tuberculosis and cholera controlled 
""
The general death rate has come down from twenty-seven per thousand
""
""
Infant mortality 
""
Much has been done 
""
Much more 
""
How far are we from our national goal of  health for all
""
""
What new programmes are being evolved  ?
""
What is the present state  ?
""
These are some of the questions that we would like to put to our
distinguished guest the Union Health Secretary  R
Srinivasan who is with us in the studio right now
""
 also said to you a little while ago that we were
expecting the presence of Dr G K Vishvakarma  Director General of Health
Services
""
Unfortunately Dr Vishvakarma has not been able to join us
""
He has possibly 
""
Mr Srinivasan thank you very much for joining us  yeah
 on the morning show
""
""
""
So first of all may I on behalf of the  family of the morning
show congratulate you on your election as Chairman  of the Executive Board
of the World Health Organisation 
""
This is a tribute to you personally and to the country that 
you represent 
""
""
""
""
""
 country especially
""
""
Thank you very much sir 
""
Mr Secretary  are you satisfied with the present state of health
care in India  ?
""
""
""
""
You know 
""
I think you know every 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
So if  health of India
alright  going to do an enormous of might of work for the
health of the world 
""
And uh in forty years something fantastic has been done as far as
health care 
""
""
""
As you said earlier you know  we certainly made a tremendous
impact in death rates 
""
Infant mortality has certainly reduced much more today 
""
Death rates have also  the
extent we wanted 
""
But of the sight of disease 
""
Our diseases are broadly 
""
Diseases due to malnutrition 
""
 made a good bit of dent into that two diseases have
been touched 
""
Diseases relatable to malnutrition is part of general economic
development 
""
As far as life-style is concerned like cancer  sex diseases and
so on 
""
But this is an urban phenomenon largely 
""
If you ask me what are the brighter parts 
""
I mean certainly 
""
Every 
""
And every fifth leprosy patient in India is a child 
""
""
""
And by the year two thousand 
be 
""
 a
tremendous dent 
""
Which gurantees you  complete freedom from leprosy in about two
and half years 
""
""
Mr Secretary  talked about the brighter spots
on the health being  ?
""
""
""
malaria 
""
Malaria 
""
Ab kafi door tak chalagaya  do teen
karan 
""
Ek karan hai  thi
unki 
doosra hai ke 
one word 
""
Aur  migration
""
infection  chala
jata hai 
""
As you probably know  malaria is different from mosquito
available
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
There may be mosquitoes with no malaria 
""
But when the mosquito carries the parasite  and injects it into
the blood system 
""
And there is another aspect  I think people who understand and
want to discuss about public health issues in India must remember this 
that for the poor people 
""
Priority is illness 
""
And how to get out of sickness as soon as possible 
""
So if you don't have  you get
back incompletely cured 
""
Malaria comes back then
""
""
You raised this  the poorer sections
of society
""
Now in  every developing country I presume there is a certain
dicotomy  between the level of health care available in the rural areas
 health
care 
""
Why  does one have the impression that it is particularly acute
in India  ?
""
""
""
""
Dekhye 
""
 and
rural health needs 
""
Though the poor in both areas 
""
This question has been tackled in our planning 
""
""
""
""
""
 ki niti hai ke jyada se
jyada  banao
""
""
Health 
State  minimum needs
programme 
jyada se jyada 
""
""
But you see  you should not refuse the creation of rural health
infrastructure 
""
But what  come to be known all
over the world as the primary health care approach 
""
""
What is the difference  ?
""
""
In one case we create infrastructure  to reach people
dispensaries  midwife
doctor 
""
But in the case of primary health care approach  woh
kaheta hai ke jyada se jyada jage de 
""
Let people get  from the
simplest sources 
""
 you must be able to get
eighty-five percent of the normal illnesses treated  at the nearest health
centre
""
You don't have to go to a hospital
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
You also don't require a specialist 
""
You must understand 
""
One is the issue everybody must take care of his health
""
Government can't take care of his health 
""
Second is a community by itself can do a lot of self-help 
""
It has been done 
""
The third is  everybody do not be taken care of by a specialist
""
""
Ordinary doctors ordinary para-medicals 
can render a tremendous amount of care 
""
Now primary health care approach involves rural 
""
""
But it is not only rural infrastructure  it is a
philosophy 
""
Community can have a lot of self-help in health  and government
can supplement 
""
Now one important facility there is health education 
""
So people can't take care of the health unless they know  what
to do about it
""
""
""
""
""
Right

 Ek iske saath sambandhit sawal yeh hai ke hum ne aksar
dekha hai jo hamare  hai chikitsak jo hain woh gramin
shetra mein jakar kam nahi karte  Jee saheb

Balke main to yahan tak kahoonga ke Dilli mein bade haspatalon
mein jo  hain agar unme se kisi ki kisi ka tabadla
Dilli ke kisi gaon mein hojaye to uski ek hi koshish hoti hai ke kis tarah
mil milakar apna apni 
""
""
""
 would you tackle this problem ?
""
""
No of course not let me say 
""
First of all  been on behalf of the doctors well
I think  mind you there can't be any public health programme in this
country without the leadership 
""
How 
""
""
""
""
""
The doctor has to be the leader of public health 
""
And he must provide the linkages in public health 
""
After having said that I would say  a very large number of
rural areas are serviced by doctors 
""
Circumstances differ from state to state 
""
If you went to a state like Madras or Maharashtra  or even
Bengal  a large number of people work in rural areas
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
 jo hai
kafi bade acche kisam ki  ke prapt karnewale hain
""
""
""
No  the best doctors in the world
""
I mean everbody 
""
""
 been trained I think in
conditions  which require certain amount of infrastructure for them to
function 
""
""
""
""
""
Since 
been given a good course of education  in a
part of them to go to rural areas 
""
A large number of things have been done by government
""
We have  we've
 pri
""
""
I think gradually  as development increases excess increase of
his own system increased 
""
Mind you  that as against about four
lakhs of doctors  three and a half lakhs doctors of the allopathic system
 hakims
""
""
They are already available in the rural areas 
""
So  not as if the rural areas is totally without any
medical help 
""
But allopathic modern system of medicine  with a backup of
dispensaries and drug etcetera  somewhat
slowly
""
""
Mr Srinivasan one other question
""
This is regarding the availability of medicines 
""
 bazaar mein bahut
bikti hai 
""
Now what is the position  doing to control
this  ?
""
""
""
very difficult question to answer 
""
First of all prescription vary 
""
There are cases where 
definite 
""
But 
nakli dawayee  which tested
by efficacy test 
""
Tested by bio availability test is not measured up 
""
It is not uh totally 
misleading in  effect
""
It claims more than it does 
""
The reason for that is 
that have to go into this is improving slowly 
""
But again please don't lose the perspective 
""
We produce about three thousand  worth of
medicine 
""
 a good part of it comes from large
industries 
""
Good part of it comes from well run small industry 
""
I would say that there that medicine is as good as anybody else
""
""
But  and the only way to do
it is to have drug regulatory action 
""
Now drug regulatory action has to be within the law 
""
So we must have drug inspectors more laboratory facilities 
""
What is more important or more acute  consumer consciousness
""
""
""
You mentioned a little while ago that the present emphasis
""
""
 the new concepts and technologies and this will
be my last question  ?
""
""
Yeah
""
But you see  early
detection  has an approach
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Take cancer for instance 
""
Cancer of the breast  oral
cancer for men 
""
I think  possible to have lot more of education given
""
""
So that they can detect either by the help of a friend or by
themselves 
""
What is it that requires treatment  ?
""
And  now clear for instance in cancer if you detect
early 
""
Take for instance oral health and dental health 
""
As a country we wash a lot 
""
Inspite of that our oral health is declining 
possible for us  not
tremendously different from what is known 
involvement of people  is part
of the primary health approach  would be the main issue
""
""
Mr Secretary  will we have health for all by two thousand
 ?
""
""
""
certainly  some
diseases definitely 
""
 have much creative effective immunization of
children against preventable diseases 
""
We would have I hope much greater positive awareness of health 
""
And my own personal feeling is  I hope that people would be
encouraged  and medicine would stand
 somewhat demystified
""
""
Thank you very much sir for joining us on the morning show
and sharing with us your views and perspectives about health care in India
past present and future
""
We appreciate your presence
""
Thank you very much indeed
