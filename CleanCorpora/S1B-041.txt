 There're over fifteen thousand primary health centres
and sub-centres in the country 
 There're over one hundred thousand sub-centres 
located scattered throughout the country 
Life expectancy has gone up from thirty-six to around fifty-six
Today health care is available in urban and rural areas 
Plague and small-pox have been eradicated 
Malaria tuberculosis and cholera controlled 
The general death rate has come down from twenty-seven per thousand
 to eleven per thousand 
Infant mortality has declined sharply 
Much has been done 
Much more remains to be done 
How far are we from our national goal of health for all
 by the year two thousand A D 
What new programmes are being evolved ?
What is the present state of public health care in India ?
These are some of the questions that we would like to put to our
distinguished guest the Union Health Secretary Sri R
Srinivasan who is with us in the studio right now
 We've also said to you a little while ago that we were
expecting the presence of Dr G K Vishvakarma Director General of Health
Services
Unfortunately Dr Vishvakarma has not been able to join us
He has possibly been held up somewhere 
Mr Srinivasan thank you very much for joining us yeah
 on the morning show
 We're honoured and delighted to have you with us 
So first of all may I on behalf of the family of the morning
show congratulate you on your election as Chairman of the Executive Board
of the World Health Organisation 
This is a tribute to you personally and to the country that 
you represent 
 Yeah 
 First the country especially
Thank you very much sir 
Mr Secretary are you satisfied with the present state of health
care in India ?
 That's a very large question and uh 
You know let's get this in perspective 
I think you know every sixth human being is an Indian 
Uhm uhm 
So if you're going to get our health of India
alright we're going to do an enormous of might of work for the
health of the world 
And uh in forty years something fantastic has been done as far as
health care facilities are concerned 
 That's been an area of development 
As you said earlier you know we certainly made a tremendous
impact in death rates 
Infant mortality has certainly reduced much more today 
Death rates have also tended to decline but not to the
extent we wanted 
But of the sight of disease 
Our diseases are broadly diseases due to infection 
Diseases due to malnutrition and life-style 
 We've made a good bit of dent into that two diseases have
been touched 
Diseases relatable to malnutrition is part of general economic
development 
As far as life-style is concerned like cancer sex diseases and
so on 
But this is an urban phenomenon largely 
If you ask me what are the brighter parts so far 
I mean certainly we've done well in leprosy 
Every fourth leprosy patient in the world is an Indian 
And every fifth leprosy patient in India is a child 
 It's very enormous burden 
And by the year two thousand it may not may 
be possible to eradicate it 
 It's certainly it would be possible to have a
tremendous dent because of the multi drug therapy 
Which gurantees you complete freedom from leprosy in about two
and half years 
Mr Secretary you've talked about the brighter spots
on the health being kamiyan kaun kaun si hai ?
 Kamiyan to saheb thi hai ek to hai 
malaria ke bare mein 
Malaria ko hamne hataya 
Ab kafi door tak chalagaya sirf ek wapas agayi do teen
karan 
Ek karan hai jo daviyaan pesticides thi
unki resistance ho gayi uhm 
doosra hai ke water bodies development se chalti bahut 
one word hote jarahe 
Aur infected log to itne migration
 hota hai labour population ka 
infection ek jagah se doosri jagah parasite chala
jata hai 
As you probably know malaria is different from mosquito
available
 Uhm 
Yeah 
There may be mosquitoes with no malaria 
But when the mosquito carries the parasite and injects it into
the blood system then the man becomes infected 
And there is another aspect I think people who understand and
want to discuss about public health issues in India must remember this 
that for the poor people health is not a priority 
Priority is illness 
And how to get out of sickness as soon as possible 
So if you don't have the full regimen of medicine you get
back incompletely cured 
Malaria comes back then
You raised this question of about the poorer sections
of society
Now in every developing country I presume there is a certain
dicotomy between the level of health care available in the rural areas
 gramin kshetra mein jis prakar ke haspatal hain ye health
care hai aur jo urban areas milte hai 
Why does one have the impression that it is particularly acute
in India ?
 Nahi saheb 
Dekhye we're confusing two issues 
 There's the issue of rural health infrastructure and
rural health needs versus urban health need 
Though the poor in both areas deserves the same 
This question has been tackled in our planning 
 We've done well not enough 
 We're going to do more 
 Yeh nai government ki niti hai ke jyada se
jyada rural areas mein resources banao
 
Health to State subject hai aur 
State ki planning mein minimum needs
programme mein public health programmes mein 
jyada se jyada rural infrastructure badate jayen 
But you see you should not refuse the creation of rural health
infrastructure 
But what is has come to be known all
over the world as the primary health care approach 
What is the difference ?
In one case we create infrastructure to reach people
dispensaries haspatals sub-centre nurse midwife
doctor 
But in the case of primary health care approach woh
kaheta hai ke jyada se jyada jage de 
Let people get access to medical aid from the
simplest sources 
 Kahene ka matlab hai you must be able to get
eighty-five percent of the normal illnesses treated at the nearest health
centre
You don't have to go to a hospital
Uhm 
You also don't require a specialist 
You must understand that there are three issues here 
One is the issue everybody must take care of his health
Government can't take care of his health 
Second is a community by itself can do a lot of self-help 
It has been done 
The third is everybody do not be taken care of by a specialist
Ordinary doctors ordinary para-medicals the health system 
can render a tremendous amount of care as near as possible 
Now primary health care approach involves rural in 
 infrastructure 
But it is not only rural infrastructure uhm it is a
philosophy that you can take care of your health 
Community can have a lot of self-help in health and government
can supplement by making available health facilities 
Now one important facility there is health education 
So people can't take care of the health unless they know what
to do about it
 Uhm 
Right
 Ek iske saath sambandhit sawal yeh hai ke hum ne aksar
dekha hai jo hamare doctor hai chikitsak jo hain woh gramin
shetra mein jakar kam nahi karte infact I think Jee saheb
 was complaning about this Jee saheb 
 Deepakji aap bilkul sahi kar rahe hain
Balke main to yahan tak kahoonga ke Dilli mein bade haspatalon
mein jo doctor hain agar unme se kisi ki kisi ka tabadla
Dilli ke kisi gaon mein hojaye to uski ek hi koshish hoti hai ke kis tarah
mil milakar apna apni transfer jo hai woh shaher mein 
 karwa le 
 How how would you tackle this problem ?
No of course not let me say it is not true 
First of all I've been on behalf of the doctors well
I think mind you there can't be any public health programme in this
country without the leadership and complete involvement of doctors 
How can that absolutely 
 Absolutely absolutely 
The doctor has to be the leader of public health 
And he must provide the linkages in public health 
After having said that I would say a very large number of
rural areas are serviced by doctors 
Circumstances differ from state to state 
If you went to a state like Madras or Maharashtra or even
Bengal a large number of people work in rural areas
Uhm 
 Magar sawal yeh hai ye doctor jo hai
kafi bade acche kisam ki education ke prapt karnewale hain
No we've the best doctors in the world
I mean everbody accept that 
 And they've been trained I think in
conditions which require certain amount of infrastructure for them to
function 
 They've a family to live 
 They've some kind of education of children and so on 
Since they're exceptionally gifted uh professionals 
been given a good course of education there is some reluctance in a
part of them to go to rural areas 
A large number of things have been done by government
We have allowances we've incentives we've
 created houses quarters and so on as part of the pri
 primary health infrastructure scheme 
I think gradually as development increases excess increase of
his own system increased doctors are in fact available 
Mind you may I also say this that as against about four
lakhs of doctors three and a half lakhs doctors of the allopathic system
 there're about four lakhs of wise render hakims
 and so on 
They are already available in the rural areas 
So it's not as if the rural areas is totally without any
medical help 
But allopathic modern system of medicine with a backup of
dispensaries and drug etcetera is spreading perhaps somewhat
slowly
Mr Srinivasan one other question
This is regarding the availability of medicines 
 Hum ne dekha hai ke nakli dawayiaan bazaar mein bahut
bikti hai 
Now what is the position what you're doing to control
this ?
 Saheb you see you know it's 
very difficult question to answer 
First of all prescription vary 
There are cases where nakli dawayiaan asal mein 
definite asal mei hai if I may say so 
But bahut si jagah pe what you say is 
nakli dawayee is in fact dawayee which tested
by efficacy test does not measure up 
Tested by bio availability test is not measured up 
It is not uh totally uh a kind of uh it's it's 
misleading in it's effect
It claims more than it does 
The reason for that is the quality of good manufacturing 
that have to go into this is improving slowly 
But again please don't lose the perspective 
We produce about three thousand crores worth of
medicine 
 Two words I think a good part of it comes from large
industries 
Good part of it comes from well run small industry 
I would say that there that medicine is as good as anybody else
But yeah there are black sheep and the only way to do
it is to have drug regulatory action 
Now drug regulatory action has to be within the law 
So we must have drug inspectors more laboratory facilities 
What is more important or more acute consumer consciousness
You mentioned a little while ago that the present emphasis
 the present priorities on health care in rural areas 
 What're the new concepts and technologies and this will
be my last question ?
Yeah
But you see technology wise certainly the early
detection has an approach
Uhm 
Take cancer for instance 
Cancer of the breast cancer of the cervic for women oral
cancer for men 
I think it's possible to have lot more of education given
 to people to school teachers 
So that they can detect either by the help of a friend or by
themselves 
What is it that requires treatment ?
And it's now clear for instance in cancer if you detect
early you can get it completely cured 
Take for instance oral health and dental health 
As a country we wash a lot 
Inspite of that our oral health is declining it's 
possible for us uh to get so technology is going to be not
tremendously different from what is known but health education 
involvement of people getting people to look after the health is part
of the primary health approach would be the main issue
Mr Secretary will we have health for all by two thousand
 ?
 It's very broad question and what do we mean 
certainly we'll have much creative control over disease some
diseases definitely 
 We'll have much creative effective immunization of
children against preventable diseases 
We would have I hope much greater positive awareness of health 
And my own personal feeling is I hope that people would be
encouraged to take care of their own health and medicine would stand
 somewhat demystified
Thank you very much sir for joining us on the morning show
and sharing with us your views and perspectives about health care in India
past present and future
We appreciate your presence
Thank you very much indeed
