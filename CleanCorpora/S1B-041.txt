 over fifteen thousand primary health centres

Today 
""
Plague and small-pox have been eradicated 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
How far are we from our national goal of  health for all
""
""
What new programmes are being evolved  ?
""
""
""
""
distinguished guest the Union Health Secretary  R
""
""
 also said to you a little while ago that we were
""
""
""
""
""
He has possibly 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of the World Health Organisation 
""
This is a tribute to you personally and to the country that 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 country especially
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You know 
""
I think you know every 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As you said earlier you know  we certainly made a tremendous
impact in death rates 
""
Infant mortality has certainly reduced much more today 
""
""
extent we wanted 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
development 
""
""
so on 
""
But this is an urban phenomenon largely 
""
If you ask me what are the brighter parts 
""
""
""

Ek karan hai  thi

doosra hai ke 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
the blood system 
""
""
want to discuss about public health issues in India must remember this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of society
""
Now in  every developing country I presume there is a certain
""
""
care 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
jyada se jyada 
""
""
But you see  you should not refuse the creation of rural health
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Let people get  from the
simplest sources 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Second is a community by itself can do a lot of self-help 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ordinary doctors ordinary para-medicals 
""
""
""
""
""
But it is not only rural infrastructure  it is a
""
""
Community can have a lot of self-help in health  and government
""
""
""
""
So people can't take care of the health unless they know  what
""
""
""
""

 Deepakji aap bilkul sahi kar rahe hain

""
""
First of all  been on behalf of the doctors well
""
country without the leadership 
""
How 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
After having said that I would say  a very large number of
rural areas are serviced by doctors 
""
""
""
""
Bengal  a large number of people work in rural areas
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No  the best doctors in the world
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
been given a good course of education  in a
""
""
""
""
We have  we've
""
""
""
""
""
""
Mind you  that as against about four
""
 hakims
""
""
""
""
""
medical help 
""
But allopathic modern system of medicine  with a backup of
""
slowly
""
""
Mr Srinivasan one other question
""
This is regarding the availability of medicines 
""
 bazaar mein bahut
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
very difficult question to answer 
""
First of all prescription vary 
""
""
definite 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
misleading in  effect
""
It claims more than it does 
""
The reason for that is 
""
""
But again please don't lose the perspective 
""
We produce about three thousand  worth of
""
""
 a good part of it comes from large
""
""
""
""
I would say that there that medicine is as good as anybody else
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we must have drug inspectors more laboratory facilities 
""
""
""
""
""
You mentioned a little while ago that the present emphasis
""
""
""
be my last question  ?
""
""
Yeah
""
""
detection  has an approach
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
cancer for men 
""
I think  possible to have lot more of education given
""
""
So that they can detect either by the help of a friend or by
themselves 
""
What is it that requires treatment  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Inspite of that our oral health is declining 
""
""
""
of the primary health approach  would be the main issue
""
""
Mr Secretary  will we have health for all by two thousand
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And my own personal feeling is  I hope that people would be
encouraged  and medicine would stand
""
""
""
""
""
past present and future
