We had already learnt about the space flight
of Yuri Gagarin the pioneer in the field of uh space flight 
We have come upto the launching of the spacecraft 
Further we studied will study on page
fifty-seven

At

Fifty-seven 
How many days after the launching the first and the second
stages of rockets had bend down and fallen away the spacecraft
projectory altered as I turned to go into orbit parallel with the earth
 surface 
Gagarin pulled himself towards the window I can see
the earth in a haze 
 I'm feeling fine 
A moment later he added It looks uh beautiful
 
He was rather uh startled and exasperated when he looked
through the window to the earth down below 
He says I can see in a haze or it was not very
clear
The vision was not very clear
It was murky or rather uh foggy or misty 
Therefore he says in spite of the fact that I can see the
earth in a haze
It looks so beautiful 
He loosened the scarf holding him to his couch 
His body weightless in space rose slightly above the seat 
though still held uh loosened scarf 
He was in fact floating in his cabin 
When he loosened his belt he was floating in the cabin 
as you are aware of he experiences the weightlessness there in the outer
space
Therefore he was floating 
Every three or four minutes he repeated his instrument reading
through the radio telephone and received confirmation from ground
control 
Straight in front of him in his cabin was an instrument
panelled with the globe navigator 
A remarkable device which represented the earth below him 
The globe slowly resolved as his position altered in
relation to the earth 
Quite often he had to come into contact with the earth station
 or it is otherwise known as the earth controlling station 
There was the panel of instruments displayed in his cabin 
He had to observe the readings and the functions of this cabin
 and it has to be conveyed through the telephone to the uh ground
station 
And they will confirm and accordingly they give instructions 
what is to be done uh how it should be done so that he is always in
contact with the uh earth station though he is all alone in the
 Vostok 
In the cabin away from uh the earth hundreds of miles
 travelling at the tremendous speed of uh about eighty thousand uh
 miles per hour 
Still he is in contact with the earth station and 
it is the two way system 
He will inform them and they will accordingly uh instruct
him what is to be done and what not to be done 
But the minutes after the launching he was over South Africa
 South America 
 All is well he reported I am not
too much troubled by the feeling of weightlessness 
The report was given to the world by way of Moscow radio 
Forty-six forty-five minutes after launching he was just above
the South America and he conveyed uh to the earth station though
he experiences weightlessness fear of gravity 
 It does not cause any harm to him and this
report was rather broadcast by the Moscow radio to all the 
peoples in Russia 
A little later the Atlantic was below him just visible only
surface and of course quite invisible was the Russian tracking ship
 using radar equipment to keep contact with the invisible spaceship
A little later he was above the Atlantic Ocean 
So he could see the sea or ocean clearly 
He could not see the tracking ship 
A ship was uh equipped with radar sophisticated uh 
instruments to track the uh course of uh Gagarin's flight
He could see the ocean clearly 
Despite he couldn't see the ship which is uh detailed
for tracking his uh flight 
After just over an hour the space flight he was passing the coast
of Africa a red light in the instrument panel gleamed 
This was a warning that the descent would begin in ten minutes 
He checked the instruments again and then reported that all was
well 
While he was above Africa a red light was gleaming 
shining
This was an indication his return journey should start within a
short while 
 Do you want to make an alteration in the flight plan
 ?
He was asked from the earth station the ground control he
was asked whether he would like to change any uh change in the 
schedule of his or plan of his flight whether he wants to remain in the
space for a uh extended period ?
 Cough 
He replied that he was not to be brought down as planned
Sorry 
He replied that he wanted to be brought down as planned although he
would how nice to go round the world again 
And although the cabin was stored with ten days supply of food in
case of any landing difficulty Gagarin thought it best to keep to the 
prepared flight scheme 
He informed the ground control though he would like to
continue the flight for an extended period he wants uh everything
should be done according to the plan or the schedule 
Therefore he said that he is ready for everything is
ready
He checked for the return journey 
At just the right moment retro-rockets were automatically fired
 to slow off the spaceship at the same time the cabin was turned to
exactly the right angle for the entry of the earth atmosphere 
This operations were dealt with the with by
a computer on the ground although in case the need Gagarin could have
used manual control 
Automatically the retro-rocket that means to slow down the speed
 and tearing off the uh spacecraft because when it enters
the atmosphere there is rather there is the line imaginary
line the outer space and the atmosphere 
There was a lot of rather you see that what you call that uh
 heat generated when the space spacecraft re-enter our uh
atmosphere
That is why they used to make the spacecraft with a particular
 uh metal which can resist or withstand the astronomical amount of
heat produced
Even then uh spa cosmonauts astronauts are also uh
made to wear a number of space suits to avoid any harm when it re-
enters the uh our atmosphere 
So it was ready retroket rocket that means for receiving
coming back automatically it was fired
Everything was done by computer 
Though there was the alternative provision for Gagarin to
operate these things manually
If something goes wrong he has to come back to the earth
Therefore they always keep the contigency plan or alternative
arrangement 
If everything goes smoothly the computer will operate 
If the firing of the rocket from time to time the
tearing off the spacecraft everything will be monitored and controlled by
the earth controlled station 
After this exactness was record
A very slight error might mean a lightening at a point of many
miles from that intended 
A slightly greater error could result in a descent with a space
cabin at the wrong angle and it's destruction by the heat
resulting from the air friction 
It had to be done very meticulously 
Very uh rather you see that uh uh exactly in the sense
very with clinical precision precisely everything has to be done 
A minor negligible error can cause uh a tremendous uh rather
you see that a damage which may cause the destruction of uh 
spacecraft and uh cosmonaut Gager Gagarin himself 
So everything has to be very precise 
Gagarin felt the jolt of the breaking rockets gave the
shattereing rock but the change was not violent as he has expected 
He felt the sensation of weightlessness gradually leaving him
As he started his returning journey the air brake was applied
he could feel the jolt
Suddenly he was rather you see that uh jolted or moved 
And then he was feeling the rather you see that the 
gravitation of the earth as he was nearing to the earth the
weightlessness was rather vanishing or on the decrease 
The pressure became stronger and stronger as the Vostok
 descended 
His face visible on the television screen became drawn and tight
almost in the flatness 
The nose forced in the eye sockets widened 
He could barely see 
Speech was beyond him though his hearing remained 
The voice of the ground controller was saying that all was well
When that spacecraft the Vostok re-entered the
atmosphere for a few moments it was unbearable for him 
His face was flattened his eye sockets were bulging and 
he could not even speak 
Only he could hear and he could hear the ground station was
telling everything was going on smoothly after the schedule 
don't worry 
Otherwise he was experiencing there for a uh few moments 
quite uncomforatable because his face was swollen or flattened eyes
were bulging 
He could not talk 
Restlessness he felt drowsiness he felt except he could 
uh hear 
The agonizing G-pressure lasted only a minute or two 
Then it was lifted
His weight became more normal 
This unbearable and agonizing the painful the most
painful experience lasted for two minutes 
Then he was alright 
Above target and on coast parachute raised coming on it
was control system 
Then again it was conveyed everything was in perfect
trim perfect condition 
 Extended noise 
The voice prepared him for the physical shock as the parachute
opened above the capsule 
The slowing down of the Vostok was so abrupt
that it was like a blow in the church 
The spacecraft also is fitted with a parachute 
We can imagine when it travels at a tremendous speed of eighteen
 thousand miles if if it comes back to the earth at the same speed 
it will come and dash to the earth to the destruction of uh 
spacecraft and occupant 
Therefore it has to be the speed had to be curtailed or contained
The there was the parachute it was opened 
From the window he could now recognise features of the land
below him 
It was an old training base in contrast with the rest of his
journey 
The descent was quite slow 
But the ground in fact was coming closer and closer to the 
consider considerable speed 
As he was coming down and down descending flight returning
flight he could see the land 
It was an old discarded uh uh training station there he was
going to land 
The final stages of the descent were first seen by two
women working in the fields of the widely spread parachute descended
 with the mysterious cabin suspended below it 
The woman's first thought was that they were witnessing
the arrival of a spy 
It was not very long since an American airman reconnoitre high
over Russian territory had been brought down 
The resulting neutral spy trend in Russia had got great sensation
 throughout the world 
When he was descending two women happened to see 
They were rather frightened because at that time the 
sensational uh bringing down of the U-two plane 
U-two plane is a it was a spy plane of America 
It is took it took off from Pakistan 
Uh it it could not be rather you see that traceable unless a
country has got a sophisticated instruments 
If it flies over India we may not be able to know whether it
is flight of course now we are in a position
In those days you can imagine in sixties only uh Russia
or some advanced country could detect the uh reconnoitre means spying
flight of this planes
It is called U-two plane 
It took off from Pakistan because it is a close ally of United
States
Even today it is the close ally 
So they allowed the planes the spy plane to take up
reconnoitre plane or otherwise it is called espionage spying is
called BB-Work 
This plane was on a mission to espionage or spying 
Russians uh could uh detect the presence of this plane
They brought down uh with a missile 
And the pilot was captured
His uh name uh if I I'm not wrong uh
Powell 
An air-force officer a pilot called Powell 
He was imprisoned 
After many years with Americans and Russians negotiated and uh
 he was released he was given his freedom 
In those days this sensational news was spread all over Russia
 about the bringing down of uh U-two spy plane 
This woman the poor uneducated woman of the countryside 
took this as an Ameriacn spy plane 
They were rather frightened when this spacecraft was coming
down with the parachute over it 
They mistook it for a United States or American spy planes
because the news was uh raging at that time about the bringing
down of this U-two plane
The spy the plane on its espionage or reconnoitre was brought
down
