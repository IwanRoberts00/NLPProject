We had  space flight

We have come upto the launching of the spacecraft

Fifty-seven 
""
""
How many days after the launching  the first and the second
""
""
""
""
Gagarin pulled himself towards the window  I can see
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
through the window to the earth down below 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore he says  in spite of the fact that I can see the
""
""
""
""
He loosened the scarf holding him to his 
""
""
though still held 
""
He was in fact floating in his cabin 
""
""
as you are aware of he experiences the weightlessness  there in the outer
""
""
Therefore he was 
""
""
through the radio telephone  from ground
control 
""
Straight in front of him  in his cabin was an instrument
""
""
A remarkable device which represented the earth below him 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
station 
""
""
what is to be done  so that he is always in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
too much troubled by the feeling of weightlessness 
""
The report was given to the world by way of Moscow radio 
""
Forty-six forty-five minutes after launching  he was just above
the South America  though
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
A little later he was above the Atlantic Ocean 
""
""
""
""
""
A ship was uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Despite  detailed
""
""
""
of Africa 
""
This was a warning that the descent would begin in ten minutes 
""
""
well 
""
While he was above 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
schedule of his or plan of his flight  whether he wants to remain in the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sorry 
""
""
would 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ready
""
""
""
""
 at the same time the cabin was turned to
""
""
This operations  by
""
""
""
""
""
the  imaginary
""
""
There was a lot of rather you see that  what you call that uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
made to wear a number of space suits  when it re-
enters the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore they always keep the  contigency plan or alternative
""
""
""
""
If the firing of the  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
resulting from the air friction 
""
It had to be done very meticulously 
""
""
""
""
""
""
spacecraft and uh 
""
So everything has to be very precise 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As he started his returning journey  the air brake was applied
""
""
Suddenly he was rather you see that uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Speech was beyond him though his hearing remained 
""
The voice of the ground controller was saying that all was  well
""
""
When that spacecraft the  re-entered the
""
""
""
he could not even speak 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
were bulging 
""
He could not talk 
""
""
uh hear 
""
The agonizing G-pressure lasted only a minute or two 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
was control system 
""
Then again it was conveyed  in perfect

women  of the widely spread parachute descended
""
""
""

When he was descending 
""
They were rather frightened
