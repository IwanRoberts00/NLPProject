We had  space flight
of Yuri Gagarin

We have come upto the launching of the spacecraft

How many days after the launching  the first and the second
stages of rockets  the spacecraft
projectory altered as I turned to go into orbit  parallel with the earth
""
""
Gagarin pulled himself towards the window  I can see
the earth in a haze 
""
""
""
A moment later he added  uh beautiful
""
""
He was rather uh  when he looked
through the window to the earth down below 
""
He says  or it was not very
clear
""
The vision was not very clear
""
It was 
""
Therefore he says  in spite of the fact that I can see the
earth  in a haze
""
It looks so beautiful 
""
He loosened the scarf holding him to his 
""
His body weightless in space 
though still held 
""
He was in fact floating in his cabin 
""
When he loosened his belt 
as you are aware of he experiences the weightlessness  there in the outer
space
""
Therefore he was 
""
Every three or four minutes  he repeated his instrument reading
through the radio telephone  from ground
control 
""
Straight in front of him  in his cabin was an instrument
panelled with the globe navigator 
""
A remarkable device which represented the earth below him 
""
The globe slowly  in
relation to the earth 
""
Quite often he had to  come into contact with the earth station
""
""
There was the panel of instruments displayed in his cabin 
""
He had to  observe the readings and the functions of this cabin
 uh ground
station 
""
And they will confirm and accordingly they give instructions 
what is to be done  so that he is always in
contact with the  in the
""
""
In the cabin  hundreds of miles
 about eighty thousand uh
""
""
Still 
it is the two way 
""
He will inform them  uh instruct
him 
""
But the minutes after the launching  he was over South Africa
""
""
 I am not
too much troubled by the feeling of weightlessness 
""
The report was given to the world by way of Moscow radio 
""
Forty-six forty-five minutes after launching  he was just above
the South America  though
he experiences weightlessness 
""
 and this
report was rather 
peoples in Russia 
""
A little later  just visible only
surface  was the Russian tracking ship
 radar equipment to keep contact with the invisible spaceship
""
""
A little later he was above the Atlantic Ocean 
""
So he could see the 
""
He could not see the 
""
A ship was uh 
instruments to track the  flight
""
""
He could see the ocean clearly 
""
Despite  detailed
for tracking his 
""
After just over an hour the space flight he was passing the coast
of Africa 
""
This was a warning that the descent would begin in ten minutes 
""
He checked the instruments  again and then reported that all was
well 
""
While he was above 
shining
""
This was an indication  his return journey should start within a
short while 
""
 Do you want to make an alteration in the flight plan
 ?
""
He was asked  the ground control he
was asked 
schedule of his or plan of his flight  whether he wants to remain in the
space for a  ?
""
""
""
He replied that  to be brought down as planned
""
""
Sorry 
""
He replied that he wanted to be brought down as planned although he
would 
""
And although the cabin was stored with ten days supply of food in
case of any landing difficulty 
prepared flight scheme 
""
He informed the  though he would like to
continue  everything
should be done according to the plan or the schedule 
""
Therefore he said that  everything is
ready
""
He checked 
""
At just the right moment retro-rockets were automatically fired
 at the same time the cabin was turned to
exactly the right angle 
""
This operations  by
a computer on the ground  although in case the need Gagarin could have
used manual control 
""
Automatically the retro-rocket that means to slow down the speed
 when it enters
the  imaginary
line 
""
There was a lot of rather you see that  what you call that uh
 uh
atmosphere
""
That is why they  used to make the spacecraft with a particular
 amount of
heat produced
""
Even then  uh
made to wear a number of space suits  when it re-
enters the 
""
So it was ready  receiving
coming back  automatically it was fired
""
Everything was done by computer 
""
Though there was the alternative provision for  Gagarin to
operate these things manually
""
If something goes wrong  he has to come back to the earth
""
Therefore they always keep the  contigency plan or alternative
arrangement 
""
If everything goes smoothly the computer will operate 
""
If the firing of the  the
tearing off the spacecraft everything will be monitored and  controlled by
the 
""
After this exactness  was record
""
A very slight error might mean a lightening at a point of many
miles 
""
A slightly greater error  could result in a descent with a space
cabin  destruction by the heat
resulting from the air friction 
""
It had to be done very meticulously 
""
Very uh  uh exactly in the sense
very 
""
A minor negligible error can cause uh  a tremendous uh rather
you see that 
spacecraft and uh 
""
So everything has to be very precise 
""
Gagarin felt the jolt  gave the
shattereing rock 
""
He felt the sensation  of weightlessness gradually leaving him
""
""
As he started his returning journey  the air brake was applied
he could feel the jolt
""
Suddenly he was rather you see that uh 
""
And then he was feeling the 
gravitation of the earth as he was nearing to the earth  the
weightlessness was rather vanishing 
""
The pressure became stronger and stronger as the  Vostok
""
""
His face visible on the television screen became drawn and tight
almost 
""
The nose forced in the eye sockets widened 
""
He could barely see 
""
Speech was beyond him though his hearing remained 
""
The voice of the ground controller was saying that all was  well
""
""
When that spacecraft the  re-entered the
atmosphere 
""
His face was flattened 
he could not even speak 
""
Only he could hear  and he could hear the ground station was
telling 
don't worry 
""
Otherwise he was experiencing there for a uh 
quite uncomforatable  eyes
were bulging 
""
He could not talk 
""
Restlessness he felt 
uh hear 
""
The agonizing G-pressure lasted only a minute or two 
""
Then it was lifted
""
His weight became more normal 
""
This unbearable and agonizing  the most
painful experience lasted for two minutes 
""
Then he was alright 
""
Above target  parachute raised coming on it
was control system 
""
Then again it was conveyed  in perfect
trim perfect condition 
""
""
""
The voice prepared him for the physical shock  as the parachute
opened 
""
The slowing down of the  was so abrupt
that it was like 
""
The spacecraft also is fitted with a 
""
We can imagine when it travels at a tremendous speed of eighteen
""
it will come and dash to the earth 
spacecraft and occupant 
""
Therefore it has to be the speed had to be curtailed or contained
""
""
The 
""
From the window he could now recognise  features of the land
below him 
""
It was an old  training base in contrast with the rest of his
journey 
""
The descent was quite slow 
""
But the ground in fact was coming closer and closer to the 
consider 
""
As he was coming down and down  returning
flight 
""
It was an old discarded uh uh  training station there he was
going to land 
""
The final stages of the descent  two
women  of the widely spread parachute descended
""
""
The  first thought was that they were witnessing
the arrival of a spy 
""
It was not very long since an American airman reconnoitre  high
over Russian territory had been brought down 
""
The resulting neutral spy trend in Russia had got great sensation
""
""
When he was descending 
""
They were rather frightened 
sensational uh 
""
U-two plane 
""
It 
""
Uh it it could not be rather you see that  traceable unless a
country has got a sophisticated instruments 
""
If it flies over India we may not be able to know  whether it
is flight of course now we are in a position
""
In those days  only uh Russia
or some advanced country could detect the  uh reconnoitre means spying
flight  of this planes
""
It is called U-two plane 
""
It took off from Pakistan because it is a close ally of  United
States
""
Even today it is the close ally 
""
So they allowed  the planes the spy plane to take up
reconnoitre plane  spying is
called 
""
This plane was on a mission to espionage 
""
Russians uh  detect the presence of this plane
""
They brought down uh 
""
And the pilot was captured
""
His  uh
Powell 
""
An air-force officer a pilot called Powell 
""
He was imprisoned 
""
After many years  with Americans and Russians negotiated and uh
""
""
In those days  this sensational news was spread all over Russia
""
""
This woman the poor uneducated 
took this as an Ameriacn spy plane 
""
They were rather frightened when this  spacecraft was coming
down with the parachute 
""
They mistook it for a  or American spy planes
because  about the bringing
down of this U-two plane
""
The spy  the plane on its espionage or reconnoitre was brought
down
