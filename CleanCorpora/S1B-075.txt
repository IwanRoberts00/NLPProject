""
""
So now uh we start uh departmental committee meeting
""
This committee is held before the commencement of the new academic
year 
""
The second meeting which we are going to 
""
 certain things which we have not decided in
the uh last meeting  uh now the
students election you see 
""
But nevertheless  uh the decision of having a
class representative 
taken 
""
This how we are going to select  part one representative and part
two representative for the timing is less 
""
Uh for the time being atleast  as
we are 
""
Uh  need some student participation in it also
""
So  decide upon
all  things and involvement of the
student in the whole  uh in the
""
""
This academic year especially 
""
Now  say a few
words in this context as how we are going to be a whether we are going to
have  or you are
going to decide upon class representatives 
""
""
What about the guidelines  ?
""
""
Uh 
""
There will be a student council that much is said in the new Act
""
""
But until elections are conducted and all 
""
""
But the elections are there nominations are there
""
The first 
lead
""
""
On the basis of merit uh  students should be nominated that
is the
""
""
On the on the basis of merit 
""
""
If that is in the guidelines all okay uhn 
""
""
I think 
""
""
So  talk of that
""
Now  in that case there will be one one student
""
You see from part one and one student from part two 
""
But uh  uh our
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Uhm we can have 
""
""
Uh for this  and uh
 we can have
have like this 
""
Around we are having we will be having hundred students  na
 from part one say and part second let us say hundred students
""
""
""
""
""
Oh yeah more or less
""
""
We can  and each
team should be held by 
""
He will  each team some
responsibility 
""
And atleast two team should be 
""
For example if they are not  going in a proper direction or if
they are 
guide them 
""
Two team should be given to 
""
That of a ten ten student  should
have within ten one leader 
""
So two group  having two leaders and that will be under the
control of one teacher 
""
And these  as
volunteers for 
""
From that way we can use the students
""
""
In that case we will be involving the whole  hundred lot in
it
""
""
There is nothing wrong in it
""
For example if the function is for example three  days or
four days 
""
""
 there is some confusion
""
You see what exactly do you think you are going to do ?
""
""
No what you expect from the  ?
""
""
 so are they
""
""
Don't be so sir
""
""
To help the after this for example  we may ask
them to  uh uh distribute paper
""
For example if you have seminar  you can use that
""
Or we can ask them to you know  uh uh some arrangements to be
made  certificates have to be
given by the university  they
should be shifted up so many thing should be done 
""
The for each  first check out the
activities  on the basis of activities
we can calculate how many students will uh  actually require
""
There will be uh some sort of arrangement 
there
""
For example  a a student may fall sick and uh
""
""
Do you mean that uh whatever we have decided 
for the uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Silver jubilee
""
""
Silver jubilee
""
""
One one year 
""
""
That would be separate from what the students will be doing
""
""
""
They they should be involved in that  uh that programme
""
""
In that programme
""
""
Yes  done
throughout the year okay 
""
""
""
you you should make a committee and the committee will be responsible of 
organising 
""
""
See okay but at the same time the committee without the help
of manpower it cannot do anything
""
At the same time for example  burden are there burden of
the  students will also be less
""
For example if you give  to one uh student for one committee or
one month  since they
fallen into uh settle for one 
""
So we can use ten by the turn or  each
month one 
""
So that they will get relaxation also like that
""
""
""
""
""
No but we have already made committee no
""
That would be  in the sense
""
""
""
""
""
Okay these committee should be with the students we can say
 let the each committee handle it
""
""
There will be no responsibility involved in what the committee
is 
""
""
""
""
""
Let the committee men for  uh
let us say we have got five committees  let uh one person in in the
committee hand one batch or two batch like that 
""
""
For example we are having uh this Chemistry Seminars we are
having
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Then we are having quiz and uh
""
""
Uh like uh 
""
""
Uhm so we are going to organise it
""
""
Organise it 
""
""
We just one assistant
""
""
That is what  telling
""
For the assistants only what what type of 
""
""
 Lakshminarayan how are you going to involve
all 
""
""
""
""
""
Not
""
""
""
""
""
Not not at a time
""
Let us say for example this batch work work for only for ten 
ten
""
""
But how  how they will come and report
""
Now Dr Chausalkar is  going
to assist out for him  uhn
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
His work
""
""
Now what 
""
""
 whether
""
""
""
""
""
What  one
word  we are having different committees
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Each committee will have a  student
""
""
Student group that is what I say
""
""
Ten student
""
""
Yes that is what 
""
My idea is
""
""
That could be done
""
""
Each group  burden the
students for example if you don't involve all the students what happens 
only a few students will be always over burden
""
""
No on the same line we are having  uh
souvenir committee  have
""
""
""
""
""
""
 yes they can
do whatever 
""
""
""
""
""
Souvenir committee 
""
""
No 
""
""
Example  like any other committee
""
""
Actually actually debate  committee
""
""
For that 
""
""
Debate committee  whatever
it is they will help you 
""
So each one this month  this is the group it will be there
""
""
""
""
""
Three to five students may be involved in it 
""
""
Uhn it depends upon the workload 
""
It may be  three or five or ten or it might be more
""
""
""
Now okay 
""
 started it
""
""
I I feel you have five students  and the one who goes as
 you see number one who is going to the students
council on the basis of merit  uhn
 uh
four students and one 
""
One would be chairman
""
So four from part one 
""
This is how decide
""
You make two  committees as far as part one part two is
concerned 
""
Now my  my important issue is that we can
give them some books 
""
We are going to collect funds  you see
""
""
""
""
""
 to collect money like that
""
""
Uhn 
""
So if you all put into  uh uh contract
""
""
""
Uh we can do like that also
""
""
No actually for that purpose all hundred coming  laugh
""
""
""
Should be involved
""
""
Yes what is wrong in it
""
""
Let it be four involve 
""
""
Do I  lot of work
""
""
""
""
""
Those teachers responsibility of involving all the students
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Otherwise  if you if you
involve all the hundred 
""
""
Uhn  make it compulsory in the part you will
be there you need to get atleast five 
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Five what  ?
""
""
Whatever other students are uh  donation
""
""
So you  two committees part one and
part two
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And uh  the student who is
going as a representative of the students council 
""
""
Let him
""
""
Chairman 
""
""
Chairman of the committee 
""
""
First year committee second year committee 
""
""
For collection of money 
""
""
 but what
about other activity  ?
""
""
Other activities means 
""
""
 require uh students for quiz
programme
""
""
 arranging will be there
 so many things
""
""
""
""
""
And 
""
""
Uhn even for quiz competition you require some arrangement
should be there 
""
""
Seminar also we can have a committee 
""
""
 uh look
""
""
See that you can involve  all the students in that
business you see why have committees and create problems to the  well
""
""
They have a  of feelings
""
""
""
""
""
Already there are groups and fights
""
""
Yeah why  I'm
 so why should I go there
""
""
""
""
""
""
Instead of doing that  whenever
there are seminars or quiz competitions 
""
Okay next  as Nanivadekar says he
wanted to speak something
""
""
No before that  we are going to organise
 almost
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
