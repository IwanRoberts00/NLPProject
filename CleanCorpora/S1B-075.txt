<I>
So now uh we start uh departmental committee meeting
This committee is held before the commencement of the new academic
year 
The second meeting which we are going to have 
 We'll talk certain things which we have not decided in
the uh last meeting was the thing is that uh now the
students election you see I don't know how we are going to conduct it 
But nevertheless as far as uh the decision of having a
class representative of part one and part two no that has to be 
taken 
This how we are going to select part one representative and part
two representative for the timing is less 
Uh for the time being atleast because uh we have much as
we are celebrating this twenty fifth year of departmental day 
Uh we'll need some student participation in it also
So how are we going to uh have to decide upon
all this these things and involvement of the
student in the whole programme which we are likely to have uh in the
 academic year 
This academic year especially 
Now I would like to like the teachers to say a few
words in this context as how we are going to be a whether we are going to
have a depart a committee or you are
going to decide upon class representatives 
What about the guidelines ?
Uh we have not received any guidelines 
There will be a student council that much is said in the new Act
But until elections are conducted and all 
But the elections are there nominations are there
The first candidate who has studies number marks 
lead
On the basis of merit uh students should be nominated that
is the
On the on the basis of merit 
If that is in the guidelines all okay uhn 
I think two words 
So we'll talk of that
Now in that case there will be one one student
You see from part one and one student from part two 
But uh should we have a committee for this uh our
Uhm
Uhm we can have 
Uh for this uh silver jubilee function and uh
 the one word students participating in concern we can have
have like this 
Around we are having we will be having hundred students na
 from part one say and part second let us say hundred students
 Silver jubilee function 
Oh yeah more or less
We can divide this hundred student into team and each
team should be held by a student leader team leader 
He will be having in each team some
responsibility 
And atleast two team should be one word by a teacher 
For example if they are not going in a proper direction or if
they are not in having some problem that a teacher can 
guide them 
Two team should be given to one teacher 
That of a ten ten student and each ten ten have should
have within ten one leader one word leader 
So two group having two leaders and that will be under the
control of one teacher 
And these these students could do other certain duties as
volunteers for uh for the function 
From that way we can use the students
In that case we will be involving the whole hundred lot in
it
There is nothing wrong in it
For example if the function is for example three days or
four days 
 No no there is some confusion
You see what exactly do you think you are going to do ?
No what you expect from the students ?
 Students yes so are they
Don't be so sir
To help the after this for example you know we may ask
them to uh uh distribute paper
For example if you have seminar you can use that
Or we can ask them to you know uh uh some arrangements to be
made they can do that for example all the certificates have to be
given by the university so for purchase varchase they
should be shifted up so many thing should be done 
The for each one word we can first check out the
activities check out the activities then on the basis of activities
we can calculate how many students will uh actually require
There will be uh some sort of arrangement be should be 
there
For example a a student may fall sick and uh
Do you mean that uh whatever we have decided yes 
for the uh 
 Yes 
Silver jubilee
Silver jubilee
One one year haan 
That would be separate from what the students will be doing
They they should be involved in that uh that programme
In that programme
Yes uh so a every for example it will be done
throughout the year okay but one group for this month also 
 So you cannot involve all hundred students 
you you should make a committee and the committee will be responsible of 
organising 
See okay but at the same time the committee without the help
of manpower it cannot do anything
At the same time for example burden are there burden of
the students will also be less
For example if you give to one uh student for one committee or
one month one batch for one month arrange that for since they
fallen into uh settle for one full year 
So we can use ten by the turn or each each one each
month one we'll get a new batch 
So that they will get relaxation also like that
 They will manage committee will manage 
No but we have already made committee no
That would be involved in the sense
 No 
Okay these committee should be with the students we can say
 see look here there are ten batches let the each committee handle it
There will be no responsibility involved in what the committee
is doing as the students are doing 
 But then 
Let the committee men for for example if there is uh
let us say we have got five committees let uh one person in in the
committee hand one batch or two batch like that 
For example we are having uh this Chemistry Seminars we are
having
Uhm 
Then we are having quiz and uh
Uh like uh 
Uhm so we are going to organise it
Organise it 
We just one assistant
That is what I'm telling
For the assistants only what what type of assistant 
 No Lakshminarayan how are you going to involve
all students in it 
 All students cannot 
Not
 It's same you see uh 
Not not at a time
Let us say for example this batch work work for only for ten 
ten
But how how they will come and report
Now Dr Chausalkar is going to have uh he's going
to assist out for him uhn
Uhn 
His work
Now what will they do 
 They won't uh no whether
 No 
What we'll do is we'll do is one
word we are having different committees
Yes 
Each committee will have a student
Student group that is what I say
Ten student
Yes that is what I'm telling 
My idea is
That could be done
Each group for example it won't uh burden the
students for example if you don't involve all the students what happens 
only a few students will be always over burden
No on the same line we are having one uh
souvenir committee attached to the souvenir committee we'll have
 souvenir committee 
 Yeah 
 You can have one group in one yes they can
do whatever suggested 
 We are thinking that one word 
Souvenir committee I I don't think it's 
No I'm giving you example na 
Example na like any other committee
Actually actually debate committee
For that 
Debate committee who has got quiz also whatever
it is they will help you 
So each one this month this is the group it will be there
 You see another committee is what 
Three to five students may be involved in it 
Uhn it depends upon the workload 
It may be have three or five or ten or it might be more
Now okay we've already involved them 
 We've started it
I I feel you have five students and the one who goes as
 as per the new Act you see number one who is going to the students
council on the basis of merit he'll be the chairman uhn
 one part one committee and part two committee some five students uh
four students and one one word 
One would be chairman
So four from part one four from part two 
This is how decide
You make two committees as far as part one part two is
concerned 
Now my my basic idea is my important issue is that we can
give them some books 
We are going to collect funds you see
 Uhn 
 Haan to collect money like that
Uhn uhn see I want to use them in that context 
So if you all put into a very business like uh uh contract
 cough that's how uh 
Uh we can do like that also
No actually for that purpose all hundred coming laugh
Should be involved
Yes what is wrong in it
Let it be four involve five 
Do I work lot of work
 See those 
Those teachers responsibility of involving all the students
Yeah 
Otherwise you'll not get the money if you if you
involve all the hundred 
Uhn you'll make it compulsory in the part you will
be there you need to get atleast five each student should get five 
Uhn 
Five what ?
Whatever other students are uh donation
So you you'll form two committees part one and
part two
Yes 
And uh the man who is going as a the student who is
going as a representative of the students council he'll 
Let him
Chairman okay 
Chairman of the committee 
First year committee second year committee 
For collection of money it's enough 
 Two words some students laugh but what
about other activity ?
Other activities means one word 
 We should require uh students for quiz
programme
 Haan this arranging will be there
 so many things
 Essay competition 
And for seminar I don't think 
Uhn even for quiz competition you require some arrangement
should be there na 
Seminar also we can have a committee 
 One word everyday you have to uh look
See that you can involve all the students in that
business you see why have committees and create problems to the well
They have a another kind of feelings
 Already 
Already there are groups and fights
Yeah why I'm not included in that committee I'm
 not getting two division yeah so why should I go there
 laughs 
 Yeah 
Instead of doing that let all get involved whenever
there are seminars or quiz competitions 
Okay next any other thing that has as Nanivadekar says he
wanted to speak something
No before that uhn we are going to organise
