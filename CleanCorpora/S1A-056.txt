<I>
 I'm Sumati Narvekar and I've taken my B
Sc 
Which uh faculty 
Hello a few words 
Science is not a faculty it's a vast area 
 It's one of the major 
Uhn 
 It's one of the major
 That's true
And a few words as minor
 Haan that's right how about 
you
I have done my Arts 
What Arts 
Arts Arts is B A you know like 
Yeah B A 
Yeah 
Which area 
We don't have majors actually like uh 
Which subjects have you
You know in all we have five optionals English basic
is always common
Yeah 
And uh Psychology History and Sociology 
Ah do you know something about uh use of statistics in
Psychology 
No way 
What are these
No in P G they use this 
No I haven't done my P G I have done my graduation
 I'll introduce myself two words
 my name is Girish Hullur and I have done my B Sc forestry 
So how many two words your studies 
Families 
Uhm
You should have learnt about uh forty fifty families 
 one word exclusively uh
 One word 
Forty fifty 
Yeah 
In one year means
No it usually our one word tries to see
You study entirely botony 
Yeah entire botony
Even this ecology and all 
Ecology then uh Physiology Entomology all 
Entomology so two words 
Hey come on yar I am getting you are
getting out of the track okay I'm 
Okay okay okay 
Okay
So which topic
So why why not talk something about the social and all 
 problems or something like that 
 You should have listed some something
socially relevant and most in thing 
Eh do you think uh the funds that they are collecting
for the earthquake is real worth of 
When we have a feeling that nobody is using I mean like 
the population is not as much you know it's one word 
only there and we are colleting more than uh double funds only
No they are creating a sort of reserve fund
 It's not fund and in one month two
words 
 One word 
It is said that the politicians are only eating it up 
No it directly goes to charity associations you nee
nee need not be afraid of uh the funds being used
appropriatly 
 Not afraid I mean as a citzen I think I should
know about it 
Uhn you've to di directly send it to
government okay government will supply the funds to non-government
organisation
When the people are not existing only what you are doing with
the money
What kind of people are not existing
There are people there are a few words 
 There are so many people uh the poor people 
But the funds that we are collecting
Not for the
There are many villages
But the funds that we are collecting I don't think so
Not for the people that they are existing now uhm
 but it's for people who have been crippled and who have been
disabled and who are suffering 
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm 
 It's not for those who are uh fit and they are uh
Then 
Then what 
Then what 
So how do you feel of this programme 
What programme 
M B A 
Programme M B A
I think uh M B A should be strictly made for uh
Commerce students and Engineering students 
No way no way you cannot offer management in
every field so
 Why 
There are 
No management only I don't think so it's easy for
the Arts students 
Atleast they should have some programmes for the 
 Nei you have some programmes arts
 nei you have some programmes
 Arts 
Of course one word problems nothing like that
 It's not problems I mean like we are not used to 
we are not taught about uh accountancy statistics 
Many higher students have this problem
I mean you people are hard working and usually
we have seen that Arts students are very lazy I mean like merry go
round type
 And the one word students yeah 
 Uhn very lazy 
Lazy sort of people they are not used to obstacles
 that's one word 
 They are lazy people and in the school time 
one word know that sort of 
I think they should have some training for the M B A beginners
 especially to the Arts students
Oh you mean to have foundation course for 
 They should conduct separate classes 
Atleast somehing no the basic foundation should be
little bit strong
 They'll find that they need a foundation course 
 to Arts and the science students 
 What do you need it 
I think you'll have one word 
No means regularly I mean you know even my doctor says
 I'm regularly irregular 
You better enroll for M B A this thing evening
programmes that would be better for you 
Now I am
Not this problem are like one word 
 One word actually I'm 
definitely not interested in business
I have something more interested in Psychology 
Psychology doing B A psychiatrist and work for the people especially the
mentally retarded the abnormal 
 Psychology 
And why did you opt for M B A 
Means it was just for the heck of it I appeared for it
 and I got caught 
Yeah just for one word you need to mould your
 career and you know why 
 I don't think so 
I think it is pure luck
Obviously you don't want to enter into any kind of programme
that you
No
It was actually after my graduation it was of course M B A
was the first entrance exam that was out so you know 
 A few words 
So because of success just squeeze in it 
I don't know I think
Just tried your luck 
Pure luck 
 It's two words 
I know that it's pure luck laughs 
So 
And I regret entering it
Maybe I'll be very happy doing it later on 
I mean you are planning to do 
Many people give an excuse of a sort 
 Continue 
 It's not excuse it's a reason but 
I'm not giving it up you know I'm standing by 
Just offering it 
No I'm going to do it you know the first time
was we are one word 
 One word sort of
I didn't know how to prepare first semester and all now I
know how to
Yeah now you know you have missed so many one word
 in past 
I know that's one thing I'll never be
 able to compensate 
So how do you feel uh aids is research going on
now how do you 
 I'm out of it I've no idea about it 
Come on you should be aware of it 
I mean
Everybody should be aware of it 
Of course aware of it but I'm I mean I don't
know much about it 
Hey what would you be after te ten years from
now 
Ten years from now I visualise myself as a more of a
practical man rather than in terms of success and failure which
is part of one word 
 Hey in which field you are going to be in
See any sort of thing I'll have no 
boundaries to having suitable say any kind of 
 Suitable 
What a plan 
What do you mean plan you don't have to plan you know 
everybody dreams yar 
I don't dream 
If you don't dream you can never 
 Hey it'll be lot of question 
 It's not that only when you dream you think of
doing something 
You can use 
But that is impractical 
Not practical you every man has to dream it it's
 practically proved 
Dream is something different than 
Dream in the sense not sit and day dream just you have a
feeling in you 
Someone one word 
So how do you visualise yourself 
Myself somewhere in the public field 
Maybe helping out with my dad 
 Then you're political figure
Yes somewhere with my dad 
 Like your dad 
Particularly politics or writing novels and uh full
fledged poet 
Painter that's it 
You are interested in politics 
Yeah I have two words my dad he is sitting 
sticking to this post 
So how do feel the corruption towards what kind of a 
I think you can do no mean yeah politician you can be
a perfect politician only if you are crooked 
No way no there're so many people who are not
crooked and all 
You just can't know you have to be crooked 
 Your dad know much you have 
Because politics is itself is a crooked field you know 
you have to be very crooked in it
But you have certain 
You you know if you are straight you are pulled down man 
you are just pulled down 
But you've have some leaders where whereas 
you'll have a certain affiliation towards sometime you feel that uh
You do it you know means
Always they are not corrupted 
Some people will be
I don't uh mean like I don't like politicians
I like politics 
 That's running in your blood you know 
After sometime you will become one politician 
I don't mind I mean only I'll be an
actress in one word I'm not a good a politician 
I can't be because I'm not crooked yet
Maybe one fine day when I'm put in the post 
 One usual kind of 
Maybe you'll 
I will as well solve lots of things have makes a good
politician
 It's not like accept things which is uh which
you have one word 
Look that is what I dream and I don't that is what 
I'm telling it out 
So you need a challenge always not guarding your 
 perspective 
 Something I mean like I have my own set of
principle my own way of thinking
Oh 
Everyone is now 
Because I don't compromise with it yes I listen to
you yes yes but I do whatever I want to do 
Compromise means we should compromise at times 
Look if it is affecting somebody else fine I'll 
compromise 
No you should compromise with yourself
No that's my life yeah one word 
it's my life why one word force in my business
Live and let live that's my policy 
 No way 
So others may be a few words then what 
you'll do 
Well they are elders yeah I I I can't do anything
if it's my mother or my father 
So you
But I'll try to convince them no I do it
 behind them no problem 
 So you 
So how do you react to your friends 
Friends
When they suggest something to your own way it
might means compromise
 Look yeah 
When it's my friends we share a very different
kind of relationship like 
We are very frank everybody knows who how and what she
is going to do 
Like they can literally predict your every move 
Frankness doesn't always mean 
 I'm telling you listen I'm 
 telling you know I'm not telling you frankness means
frankness means although they're telling what sort of friendship
 I'll share with my friends 
And everybody knows and most of my friends are my childhood
friends
They know what I am 
I mean they know I won't listen to anybody 
But still as a good friend they always give me the advice
And if I find it worth and if I can feel that I can take
it I do it
 Accept whatever 
You always tend to make certain adjustments in friendship 
always
Like if it if if never imposed no okay if
it is together you are doing something yes I'll co-operate
Whereas I alone have to do it no I don't take anybody's
 advice 
Of course I ask people but the more you ask people the more
advice that people giving it's more complicating for you to decide
it 
 If it is 
So let's switch on to new topics it's 
already boring deciding a single particularly one word 
I think Sumati should be speaking yeah 
 She should speak on educational standards now
 What yeah 
What man 
Sumati is more like a one word 
very good listener and usually you know good listeners they won't like
they don't know anything of themselves 
 Two words 
 Keep quiet 
 laughs 
 It's true
 That's specially true about Capricorns so you
 one word 
 Oh so you are Capricorn
He must one word 
Definitely definitely I'm a Capricorn 
Oh come on don't play tricks on 
But you know what they say on Leos because of that
 Leos two words the world the world is stable because of the Leo
 One word 
No
Why
 I'm not bosting okay because I'm a Leo
 I'm not bosting
