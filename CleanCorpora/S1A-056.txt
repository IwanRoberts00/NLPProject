""
""
We don't have majors actually like uh 
""
""

""
""
You know in all we have  English basic
is always common
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And uh 
""
""
Ah  do you know something about uh use of statistics in
Psychology 
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
""
So how many 
""
""

""
""
""

""
""

""
""
Hey come on  you are
getting out of the track okay 
""
""
Okay okay okay 
""
""
Okay
""
""
So which topic
""
""
So why why not talk something about the social 
""
""
""
 something
socially relevant and most in thing 
""
""
Eh do you think uh  funds that they are collecting
for the earthquake is real worth of 
""
When we have a feeling that nobody is using 
the population is not as much you know 
only there  double funds only
""
""
No they are creating a sort of reserve fund
""
""
 two
words 
""
""
""
""
""
It is said that the politicians are only eating it up 
""
""
No it directly goes to charity associations  nee
nee  being used
appropriatly 
""
""
 as a citzen I think I should
know about it 
""
""
Uhn  directly send it to
government  okay government will supply the funds to non-government
organisation
""
""
When the people are not existing only what you are doing with
the money
""
""
What kind of people are not existing
""
""
There 
""
""
""
""
""
But the funds that we are collecting
""
""
Not for the
""
""
There are many villages
""
""
But the funds that we are collecting  I don't think so
""
""
Not for the people that they are existing now  uhm
 for people who have been crippled and who have been
disabled and who are suffering 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
 not for those who are uh fit and they are uh
""
""
""
Then 
""
""
Then what 
""
""
Then what 
""
""
So how do you feel of this programme 
""
""
What programme 
""
""
M B A 
""
""
Programme M B A
""
""
I think  uh
Commerce students and Engineering students 
""
""
No way  management in
every field so
""
""
""
""
""
There are 
""
""
No management only  easy for
the Arts students 
""
Atleast they should have some programmes for the 
""
""
 arts
 you have some programmes
""
""
""
""
""
Of course  problems nothing like that
""
""
""
we are not taught about uh accountancy statistics 
""
Many higher students have this problem
""
""
I mean  usually
we have seen that Arts students are very lazy I mean like  merry go
round  type
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Lazy  they are not used to obstacles
""
""
""
""
one word 
""
""
I think they should have some training for the M B A beginners
 especially to the Arts students
""
""
Oh 
""
""
""
""
""
Atleast  should be
little bit strong
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think 
""
""
No  you know even my doctor says
""
""
""
You  this thing evening
programmes that would be better for you 
""
""
Now I am
""
""
Not this problem are like 
""
""
""
definitely not interested in business
""
I have something more interested in 
Psychology doing B A psychiatrist  and work for the people especially the
mentally retarded 
""
""
""
""
""
And why did you opt for M B A 
""
""
Means it was just  for the heck of it I appeared for it
""
""
""
Yeah just for  you need to mould your
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think it is pure luck
""
""
Obviously you don't want to enter into any kind of programme
that you
""
""
No
""
It was  of course M B A
was the first entrance exam that was out 
""
""
""
""
""
So because of success 
""
""
I don't know  I think
""
""
Just tried your luck 
""
""
Pure luck 
""
""
""
""
""
I know that 
""
""
So 
""
""
And I regret entering it
""
Maybe 
""
""
I mean 
""
""
Many people give 
""
""
""
""
""
""
I'm 
""
""
Just offering it 
""
""
No  you know the first time
was we are 
""
""
 sort of
""
""
I didn't know how to prepare first semester and all  now I
know how to
""
""
Yeah now you know  one word
""
""
""
I know  never be
""
""
""
So how do you feel  is research going on
now 
""
""
""
""
""
Come on 
""
""
I mean
""
""
Everybody should be aware of it 
""
""
Of course aware of it  I mean I don't
know 
""
""
Hey what would you be after  ten years from
now 
""
""
Ten years from now I visualise myself as a  more of a
practical man  failure which
is part of 
""
""
 going to be in
""
""
See any sort of thing 
boundaries 
""
""
""
""
""
What a plan 
""
""
What do you mean plan 
everybody dreams 
""
""
I don't dream 
""
""
If you don't dream you can 
""
""
""
""
""
 only when you dream you think of
doing something 
""
You can use 
""
""
But that is impractical 
""
""
Not practical  it's
""
""
""
Dream is something different than 
""
""
Dream in the sense not sit and day dream  just you have a
feeling in you 
""
""
Someone 
""
""
So how do you visualise yourself 
""
""
Myself 
""
Maybe helping out 
""
""
 political figure
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
Particularly  full
fledged poet 
""
""
Painter 
""
""
You are interested in politics 
""
""
Yeah I have 
sticking 
""
""
So how do feel the corruption towards 
""
""
I think you can do no  you can be
a perfect 
""
""
No way  so many people who are not
crooked and all 
""
""
You just can't know 
""
""
""
""
""
Because politics is itself is a crooked field you know 
you have to be  very crooked in it
""
""
But you have certain 
""
""
You you know if you are straight you are pulled down man 
you are just pulled down 
""
""
But 
you'll  sometime you feel that uh
""
""
You do it you know means
""
""
Always they are not corrupted 
""
Some people will be
""
""
I don't uh  politicians
""
I like politics 
""
""
""
""
""
After sometime you will become one politician 
""
""
I don't mind  be an
actress in 
""
I can't be  not crooked yet
""
Maybe one fine day when 
""
""
""
""
""
Maybe 
""
""
I will  have makes a good
politician
""
""
 which
you have 
""
""
Look that is what I dream and I don't 
I'm 
""
""
So you need a challenge always 
""
""
""
 I have my own set of
principle my own way of thinking
""
""
Oh 
""
""
Everyone is now 
""
""
Because I don't  yes I listen to
you yes 
""
""
Compromise 
""
""
Look if it is 
compromise 
""
""
No you should compromise with yourself
""
""
No 
it's  force in my business
""
""
Live and let live 
""
""
""
""
""
So others may be 
you'll 
""
""
Well  I I I can't do anything
if 
""
""
So you
""
""
But  I do it
""
""
""
""
""
""
So how do you react to your friends 
""
""
Friends
""
""
When they suggest something to your  it
might means  compromise
""
""
""
""
""
When  share a very different
kind of relationship like 
""
We are very frank  and what she
is going to do 
""
Like they can literally predict your every move 
""
""
Frankness doesn't always mean 
""
""
""
 frankness means
frankness means  telling what sort of friendship
""
""
And everybody knows and most of my friends are my childhood
friends
""
They know what I am 
""
I mean they know I won't listen to anybody 
""
But still  good friend they always give me the advice
""
And if I find it worth  feel that I can take
it  I do it
""
""
""
""
""
You always tend to make certain adjustments in friendship 
always
""
""
Like  if
it  co-operate
""
""
Whereas I alone have to do it  anybody's
""
""
Of course I ask people  but the more you ask people the more
advice that people giving  more complicating for you to decide
it 
""
""
""
""
""
So 
already boring deciding a single particularly 
""
""
I think Sumati should be speaking yeah 
""
""
 speak on educational standards now
""
""
""
""
""
What man 
""
""
Sumati is more 
very good listener and usually you know good listeners  they won't like
they don't 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 true
""
""
 so you
""
""
""
 you are Capricorn
""
""
He must 
""
""
Definitely definitely 
""
""
Oh come on 
""
But you know what they say on Leos  of that
 the world the world is stable because of the Leo
""
""
""
""
""
No
""
""
Why
""
""
 a Leo
""
