""
""
And the number of cases  and also these once they marketed and
""
""
Uh in ninety-one ninety-two  and

""
Number of persons detained under cognizable offence 
interruption 
""
And also sir 
""
""
He was asking how many cases  ?
""
""
Yes sir I can tell you sir
""
""
Okay fine 
""
""
Under Fera itself since nineteen  in August nineteen

""
""
The exchange rate also
""
""
Yes sir 
""
""
Market exchange rate also
""
""
Yes I can tell you 
""
Upto twenty 
right 
""
""
""
""
""
And if you want me each case individually and each amount
involved I can 
""
""
 that is enough
""
""
And also sir 
in February  the
market exchange rate upto the date was  in February ninety-three it was
twenty-six point two zero sir 
""
In February ninety-two the  March ninety-two it was twenty-five
point eight nine sir actually  hawala
 uh collect the information it was
""

""
Just  only
twelve percent sir
""
And  the percentage
of premium in  ten point
seven 
""
In April 
it's  eighth of April it is eleven point
four 
""
Now on sixteenth April it is eleven point six sir
""
""
Relevance
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Sir  actual market rate is now
eleven point some  eleven point six
""
""
No it is the percentage of premium market
""
""
It is the percentage 
there and  the
the  market instead
of going 
""
""
""
""
""
That is the speculative 
""
So  why all these schemes of liberalisation whatever
you have  that has no impact the impact is yes in the gold
field 
""
But actually the  as is being
reported  market is
going on and going on in a full speed 
""
And the  whatever you have announced during
this kind of liberalisation 
""
And number two sir  of section eight and
section  it contradicts
against the specifications  contradict the Fera Act itself
""
And that also gives the 
market to operate 
""
May I know from the honourable minister that whether it has 
brought to his notice by the custom officials that this Fera Act section
eight and section nine  is being contradicted by the
notification of R B I for which the  market is a
negotiator
""
""
Sir  the
""
""
It has certainly come down  and with the government measures
even the  and
it has made smuggling under 
""
And the second objective of these measures  prevent the
all transactions 
""
I don't say it is totally wiped out 
""
It is there 
""
But the government is making sincere efforts  to put an end to
such clandestine operation 
""
""
Mr Moghe
""
""
But about this sir Fera Act  as we are aware sir
 uh been introduced
very recently sir  and it would be very prematured to assess the impact on
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir and the present  the persons
who are  they are detained under Fera
 and even then
""
""
There 
""
""
Yes there is a provision sir  yes yes
""
""
Mr Moghe please 
""
""
""
""
""
Sir  hawala
 very difficult
to 
trade  decide on the revenue
collections and other 
""
""
 Nirmal Kanthji
""
""
""
""
""
He is entirely right  that it is a clandestine operation
from which uh 
""
Uh the question is  you had you had a
committee to estimate black income  clandestine
""
""
Why don't you have another body to enquire legal estimate  of
how much transactions take place 
""
""
Number two 
 of return is ten per cent or eleven per cent on
these transactions 
""
Imagine the rate  it is an
astronomical rate 
""
Does it means 
 that much weak so that we can derive such a high rate of
returns 
""
And 
hawala 
""
If there is full convertibility which  the I M F is desiring of
Dr Manmohan Singh 
""
Just now it is convertability 
""
You say it is a full flaw  hawala
""
""
Is there any proposal in the mind of  to
go into that so that at one stroke 
is completely eliminated 
""
And a whole structure in it  that these illegalities in the
foreign exchange trade  not only to the unorganised
sector of 
""
And you have indulge you have not  to
find out who were the people  who are connected with
those who are arrested directly 
""
Many important people in Bombay and others 
""
But apart from that  foreign bank
""
""
Through which as we have discovered it  Mr Nirmal
Kanthji  it is not violating it is going out
""
""
""
""
""
Its becoming a long speech 
""
""
I am not giving a speech sir
""
""
Yes it is becoming
""
""
Hope to account then not to account also  to that also how
much money is going out
""
""
Yes 
of the country 
 the government has no set
proposal sir 
""
And  the government
is making very sincere efforts  by
making some 
""
And  Fera
forty-four A 
 uh
transaction sir 
""
And 
""
""
But it is a little too much 
""
""
He has pointed out  how many percent
""
""
We have taken in action on several persons in Bombay  Madras
Bangalore  and Hyderabad
 operated most of accounts
also sir 
""
And this  transaction as I pointed out
earlier sir  and gold smuggling
number two is silver smuggling  and third is underinviting and
overinviting sir 
""
As the government has taken very serious view of situation
""
We are making very sincere  efforts to put down this
""
""
 one
or two words 
""
""
 the find out this
""
I have already said
