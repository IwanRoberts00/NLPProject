Sir may I know from the honourable minister the government
exchange rate and the market exchange rate in the market itself in
Delhi itself whatever the intelligence report you may be receiving 
But actually sir the market exchange the market is seeing all
 the hawala market is going on 
But if black money which is being created in this country is
being siphoned out and uh the hawala market they
are having their own fare 
So therfore may I know from the honourable minister last after
the convertability how many cases you have really identified or seen how
many uh uhm cases have been registered and how much foreign
currency you have recovered from this dealer ?
Sir the government has undertaken various schemes
like legally legal import of gold legal
import of silver and some security convertability 
And with this we have to take this decision the
 hawala fares was really flourishing and the
period from March nineteen ninety-one to March nineteen ninety-two it
was raised between twenty-five to thirty percent sir 
But also the government has taken so many measures 
The premium during this period raised between twelve to fifteen
percent after the introduction of several economic measures sir
And the number of cases and also these once they marketed and
 hawala rate existed difference 
Uh in ninety-one ninety-two ninety-one to ninety-two and
ninety-two uh earlier ninety-two to March ninety-three as we have said
sir 
If you want to lay it on the table I'm prepared to do
it sir 
Sir in nineteen ninety the number of searches conducted it
was two thousand one hundred and fourteen 
In nineteen ninety-one two thousand three hundred and ninety
Nineteen ninety-two it was one thousand two hundred and
fifty upto March nineteen ninety-three it was three sixty-five cases
sir 
Foreign currency you see enlarged sir 
In nineteen ninety it was one point one thirty-six point three
 three nine lakhs sir 
In nineteen ninety-one it was three hundred and fourteen
point eight five 
Nineteen ninety-two it is one ninety-two point eight six sir 
And Indian currency you see in lakhs sir 
 It's about six hundred and forty-two lakhs
 point eight five lakhs sir 
In nineteen ninety-one it is one thousand one hundred
twenty-two lakhs 
Nineteen ninety-two it is three forty-one point five zero 
lakhs sir 
Upto March nineteen ninety-three it's one
thirty-seven point eight two lakhs sir 
Number of cases registered its se se 
 seven thousand three hundred and eight-seven in nineteen
ninety 
Nineteen ninety-one it is seven thousand six hundred eleven
In nineteen ninety-two its five thousand seventeen and upto
March it is one thousand three hundred and sixty-three sir 
Number of persons arrested under Fera itself uh number in
nineteen ninety three hundred sixty-six and nineteen ninety-one its three
thirty-six sir
In nineteen ninety-two it's four thirty-seven and 
thirty-six
Number of persons detained under cognizable offence 
interruption 
And also sir it's a one word 
He was asking how many cases ?
Yes sir I can tell you sir
Okay fine 
Under Fera itself since nineteen in August nineteen
ninety-two 
The exchange rate also
Yes sir 
Market exchange rate also
Yes I can tell you 
Upto twenty seven three uh ninety-three sir 
right we have booked fourteen cases sir 
 Right 
And if you want me each case individually and each amount
involved I can tell you sir 
 No no don't want that is enough
And also sir the market exchange rate sir in 
in February ninety-two upto February ninety-three the
market exchange rate upto the date was in February ninety-three it was
twenty-six point two zero sir 
In February ninety-two the March ninety-two it was twenty-five
point eight nine sir actually and also the Bombay hawala
 market rate sir as we could uh collect the information it was
 only thirty-four thirty-four rupees in the 
February ninety-three sir 
Just it's premium in percentage it's only
twelve percent sir
And in March nineteen ninety-three sir the percentage
of premium in hawala rate it has come down to ten point
seven 
In April it has come down to ten point four and against 
it's a big rise slight rise in eighth of April it is eleven point
four 
Now on sixteenth April it is eleven point six sir
Relevance
Yes 
Sir if within that the actual market rate is now
eleven point some eleven point six
No it is the percentage of premium market
It is the percentage that's the gap that's 
there and that's the gap that attracts the no no the
the black marketists to go to the hawala market instead
of going coming to the open market 
 No no 
That is the speculative 
So that's why all these schemes of liberalisation whatever
you have announced that has no impact the impact is yes in the gold
field that has that is some impact 
But actually the hawala market as is being
reported everyday in the newspaper that hawala market is
going on and going on in a full speed 
And the the objectives whatever you have announced during
this kind of liberalisation and all this things has no meaning at all 
And number two sir the Fera Act of section eight and
section section nine the custom officers have said it contradicts
against the specifications contradict the Fera Act itself
And that also gives the handle for hawala 
market to operate 
May I know from the honourable minister that whether it has 
brought to his notice by the custom officials that this Fera Act section
eight and section nine of the Fera Act is being contradicted by the
notification of R B I for which the hawala market is a
negotiator
Sir I don't agree with the honourable member the
 hawala rate is on the increase sir 
It has certainly come down and with the government measures
even the these administrative measures it has kept smuggling and
it has made smuggling under one word 
And the second objective of these measures to prevent the
all transactions 
I don't say it is totally wiped out 
It is there 
But the government is making sincere efforts to put an end to
such clandestine operation interruption 
Mr Moghe
But about this sir Fera Act sir as we are aware sir
 the Fera Act or the amendment we have recently uh been introduced
very recently sir and it would be very prematured to assess the impact on
 hawala trade sir 
 A few words in Hindi 
Sir and the present Act under the Fera the persons
who are involved in such transactions they are detained under Fera
 and a two words and even then
There a few words 
Yes there is a provision sir yes yes
Mr Moghe please 
 A few words in Hindi 
Sir as I have already pointed out hawala
 case being a clandestine operation it's very difficult
to amo estimate the amount quantum of hawala 
trade and it's very difficult to decide on the revenue
collections and other uh monitory item 
 Shree Nirmal Kanthji
 A few words in Hindi 
He is entirely right that it is a clandestine operation
from which uh uh for the people will reap all the benefit 
Uh the question is that uh you had you had you had a
committee to estimate black income which was entirely clandestine
 interruption 
Why don't you have another body to enquire legal estimate of
how much transactions take place in the hawala market 
 number one 
Number two you have you say that the ra 
 rate of return is ten per cent or eleven per cent on
these transactions 
Imagine the rate that is being given here it is an
astronomical rate 
Does it means that the real value of the rupee 
 is that that much weak so that we can derive such a high rate of
returns 
And a few words there we will be no 
hawala market 
If there is full convertibility which the I M F is desiring of
Dr Manmohan Singh 
Just now it is convertability on the trade account only 
You say it is a full flaw and there we have no hawala
 market at all 
Is there any proposal in the mind of Dr Manmohan Singh to
go into that so that at one stroke the hawala case 
is completely eliminated 
And a whole structure in it that these illegalities in the
foreign exchange trade are taking place not only to the unorganised
sector of hawala trade 
And you have indulge you have not made any CBI enquiry to
find out who were the people who are connected who are connected with
those who are arrested directly 
Many important people in Bombay and others are involved 
But apart from that your foreign exchange bank foreign bank
 we are their hope so and not to account 
Through which as we have discovered it Mr Nirmal
Kanthji it is not violating it is going out
 Mr Nirmal kanthji 
Its becoming a long speech 
I am not giving a speech sir
Yes it is becoming
Hope to account then not to account also to that also how
much money is going out
Yes cons constitution 
of the country to access the uh hawala trade 
 it's a suggestion and at present the government has no set
proposal sir 
And regarding the as I already said the government
is making very sincere efforts putting down such transaction by
making some administrative by taking some administrative measures 
And strictly enforcing all existing clause Fera
forty-four A TADA and other uh like uh under the 
 co conva covered under the uh
transaction sir 
And as I have already pointed out sir 
But it is a little too much 
He has pointed out interruption how many percent
 we have taken action in Bombay 
We have taken in action on several persons in Bombay Madras
Bangalore and even in Delhi who have violated this and Hyderabad
 and and even who have violated operated most of accounts
also sir 
And this hawala transaction as I pointed out
earlier sir was mainly operated through earlier and gold smuggling
number two is silver smuggling and third is underinviting and
overinviting sir 
As the government has taken very serious view of situation
We are making very sincere efforts to put down this
 Ama how many cases you have one
or two words 
 You will get the find out this
I have already said
