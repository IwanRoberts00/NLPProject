<I>
Chalk with a chalk in my hand and a black board at my
disposal because that is what we are all use to 
But uh this is some sort of a formal lecture in a sense that I
will not be able to move from the uh dais uh here 
Now I have chosen for my talk today a subject 
India's science and technology policy and the possible role of
universities in its implementation 
While choosing this topic I had two view points in mind 
First that as citizens rather than as teachers you should
know in what direction our government is moving 
What should be the basis of our technological programmes
 and how should we really go about it 
Secondly I thought that as teachers of the university you
should know what we should be doing in order to assist our national
programmes
And therefore partly informative partly I could say a
request of what you should really be doing 
Now if you look into the history of mankind you will find that right
from the beginning say from the invention of the wheel you have
found that the scientific discovery has been followed by some sort of a
major sociological development or economic development where the life
patterns have changed 
You as I said you could start with the invention of the wheel
 you could come to the industrial revolution where the steam-engine
brought the revolution or you could come to the present day where the
computer uh chip is bringing about such a revolution 
And therefore it is very essential to plan our scientific
programmes 
So you can say that the industrial revolution which swept
Europe say in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries highlighted the
fact that the economic growth of a nation is largely depend upon the
scientific and technological advances it can achieve 
And therefore we must have a consistance science and technology
policy 
Now you may have a policy it may be perfectly laid down 
every step may be taken care of but you can implement that policy only
 if the proper environment is present and if you have got a trained
personnels to implement that policy 
This applies not only to science and technology it applies to
every aspect of life take even our teaching programmes 
We may know that our M Sc syllabii for example must contain A B
C D 
We also know that all these things must be taught
But unless the whole atmosphere in the university is such that
we can really teach those aspects and we got trained personnels who are
capable of teaching we find that this sort of thing doesn't work 
And therefore the first point we must always remember while
considering any policy and in this case the science and technology policy is
 that the proper background has got to be developed 
Thus you will find that when we finally come to the
implementation of the national policies the brunt will have to come
 on the university and on the teaching system
Because we are going to provide them the men who are going to
later uh act and who who in the years to come are going to lead our
scientific and technological development 
Now this aspect was well thought out by our national
leaders even before we became independent 
The science and technology policy gre owes a great
deal to the foresight of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru 
Even before we achieved independence in the days of
pre-independence uh you will find that in one of the In uh 
uh Indian National Congresses he had outlined our policies in nineteen
hundred forty-six when his Discovery of India came out
 there were statements which clearly showed that he realized 
that the social upliftment of the people was not possible unless a basic
scientific policy was designed 
And I'll just quote one sentence from his 
Discovery of India which will let you know what his thinking
was this in quotes is open quote It is science alone that can
 solve the problems of hunger and poverty of insanitation and
illiteracy of superstition and deadening customs and traditions of
vast resources running to waste of a rich country inhabitate by starving
 people 
And therefore looking at all the problems he tried to set
right the scientific background 
And while setting right the scientific background he did not
 think in terms of the natural uh resources alone in terms of say
 laboratory development but he emphasised the need of what is known as
the scientific temper 
So the very basis of the science and technology policy as
visualized by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the development of a scientific
temper 
Even in any field this could be uh applied and it basically
means that you should be able to think in a logical manner you should be
able to find out what are the next steps you are going to do and what that is
going to lead to 
Whether your uh actions are correct or incorrect whether
they can be supported or not supported that is what the scientific
attitude or the scientific temper or the scientific way of thinking means 
and that is what he emphasised
So the basic understanding is that you should first
learn to think logically and to act logically 
Now with this background he set about uh to
creating a background on which technologicl development took place 
Firstly we all know that he said that we have got to
provide better technologies which would enable the country to progress more
rapidly 
The spinning wheel or the charkha had its
own symbolic value
It had its value as far as the villages were con 
 concerned 
But simply by producing say khadi we
would not survive in the world of competition
And therefore for a even such a small thing as a
 charkha he introduced the mechanized type of 
charkha which is known as the amber charkha or it
was known as the amber charkha in those days 
Similarly he said about building dams 
Uh he said about bui building 
 up heavy industries
In fact the knowledge that the storage of water was essential
for our agricultural development led to our policy of big dams
It was at that time in the early uh the late uh say uh
late forties and early fifties that we thought of Hirakud and uh Bhakra
and so on 
And in those days he emphasised that dams our are the
temples of modern India
He did not want people to go uh to uh a temple in the religious
way think of a temple in a religious way but he thought that objects 
which could be emulated which could serve as a symbol of
progress should be our real temples 
At the same time he set about setting up large research
laboratories
The first was of course the National Chemical Laboratory at
Poona then you have the National Physical Laboratory and a chain of National
Laboratories came uh forward 
Today there are people and there is who think that these
steps were probably not in our best interest
For example uh you may say that a dam probably gave us water
it probably gave us electricity but it did not take care of the ecological
aspects or of the environmental aspects 
You can say that a national laboratory created certain
small centres of excellence but the money poured into the national laboratory
 deprived you can say the university
These are things we which we find in hind-side
But it is the fore-sight that you have got to build up a scientific
base which was Nehru's real contribution to our
development 
And in terms of this uh contribution the first thing that
India did was in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight when it adopted what
was known as a scientific policy resolution 
Do you mind if I treated it like a class-room sir ?
Because they will otherwise not be able to take down anything ahn
It was at this point that we adopted in nineteen hundred
and fifty-eight what is known as the scientific policy 
resolution 
Now this scientific policy res 
resolution was aimed at providing the basis for our scientific
programmes in future 
Now what are the main points of this scientific policy resolution ?
The first major point was to foster promote and
sustain the cultivation of science and scientific research in all aspects
 pure applied and educational 
So the promotion of research was the main framework or
the main bullwork on which our science policy was based 
The second point was to ensure an adequate supply of
research scientist of high quality 
It was this was also considered necessary not only the scientific
equipment but the scientific personnel 
The third uh point was to encourage and initiate with
all possible speed programmes for the training of scientific and
technical persons 
The next was to ensure that creative talent is encouraged
 and finds full scope in scientific activity 
And encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and
desimination of knowledge and for discovery of new knowledge 
And lastly to secure for the people of the country all the
benefits that can accrue from the acquisition and application of
scientific knowledge 
So these are the points which I will give you later 
But here we have got to emphasis the fact that what was
required was one bui building up the
scientific infra infrastructure 
Second building up this uh scientific personnel required
Third was to ensure that scientific knowledge was
dessiminated to the people 
And above all what is most important was to see that any
scientific uh programme or any scientific discovery did not lie in
science alone but it was transmitted to the people 
Now in much later you will find that uh in the late eighties
this came out in the form of our technological mission which I will talk to
about later 
But the building up of the infrastructure the building up of
the personnel require the transformation of information and the
transformation of the benefits of science to uh the rural popu
 uhn people or to the poorer section that was the main thrust or the
main basis of our science policy as formulated in nineteen hundred and
fifty-eight 
Uh the one word basic difficulty about this 
scientific policy resolution which the Lok Sabha adopted was
 it spoke of science but it did not spoke speak 
 of technology 
So the next step came in nineteen hundred and
seventy-three when a national committee for science and technology 
was formed to advise on how the scientific achievements or the scientific
material could be transferred into technology
And that is when the people came in 
Now this uh committee on science and technology 
presented an approach paper in nineteen hundred seventy three 
So this is the science and technology committee report 
And this science and technology committee report emphasised
again four or five points which are firstly the resources
allotted to research and development in India and other developing
countries were grossly inadequate
That was the first point 
The second the transfer or import of technology from
developed countries was not in the interest of developing countries 
Thirdly many required technologies could be indigenously 
developed 
Fourthly quality and relevance of education in schools and
universities had to be ensured so as to stop the stupendest waste
in human resources 
And next an adequate machinery had to be set up to monitor
 evaluate correct and redirect various programmes in science and
 technology 
Now if you look at the basic points of the report of the
nineteen hundred and seventy-three science and technology committee you
will find that they said what we are still saying in nineteen hundred and
ninety-one that is the eighteen years later 
We are not saying anything quite new we are again stating
the same fact that we don't have enough money for research that we should
not import technology from outside we should develop our own technology
 the quality of our education should improve and that an adequate
machinery should be formed to transfer the benefits of science to society
So in other words though our thinking process have been proper
 though we have realized what should be done though we know the path
on which we have to travel we are not being able to implement it 
And this if you can recall brings uh that out my opening
remarks that what is necessary is not only a science and technology
policy but the environment to promote that policy and the personnel to
promote the policy 
If after twenty years we still can not find an answer to
 uh the questions which we set ourselves uh a long time back then
there is something wrong and that wrong is that we have not developed the
right attitude in which our scientific development can take place
Then the next step is in nineteen hundred and eighty 
three when the government gave what is known as the technology
policy statement 
Now this technology policy statement tried to say
what should be our programmes of technological development 
And this is essentially something which is more or less a
repeat of what has been visualized in the science and technology 
policy 
So the government issued in nineteen eighty-three the technology
policy statement according to which the basic objectives of a 
nation's technology policy were stated to be firstly development
of indigenous technology 
Second acquisition of imported technology and its efficient
absorption and adaption appropriate to national priorities and resources
