Chalk  with a chalk in my hand and a black board at my
disposal 
""
But uh  this is some sort of a formal lecture in a sense that I
will not be able to move from the 
""
Now 
India's  and the possible role of
universities in its implementation 
""
While choosing this topic I had two view points 
""
First  citizens rather than as teachers you should
know 
""
What should be  programmes
""
""
Secondly  you
should  our national
programmes
""
And therefore  a
request of what you should really be doing 
""
Now if you look into the history of mankind you will find that right
from the beginning  you have
found that the scientific discovery  has been followed by some sort of a
major sociological development  where the life
patterns have changed 
""
You  as I said you could start with the invention of the wheel
 you could come to the industrial revolution where the steam-engine
brought the revolution  or you could come to the present day where the
computer 
""
And therefore  scientific
programmes 
""
So you can say that the industrial revolution  which swept
Europe  highlighted the
fact that the economic growth  is largely depend upon the
scientific and technological advances 
""
And therefore  we must have a consistance science and technology
policy 
""
Now you may have a policy 
every step may be taken care of but you can implement that policy  only
 and if you have got a trained
personnels to implement that policy 
""
This applies not only to science and technology it  applies to
every aspect of life take even our teaching programmes 
""
We may  know that our M Sc syllabii for example must contain A B
C D 
""
We also  know that all these things must be taught
""
But unless  the whole atmosphere in the university is such that
we can really teach those aspects  and we got trained personnels who are
capable of teaching we find that 
""
And therefore the first point we must always remember  while
considering any policy and in this case the science and technology policy is
""
""
Thus  you will find that when we finally come to the
implementation  the brunt will have to come
 on the university and on the teaching system
""
Because we are going to provide them  the men who are going to
later  uh act and who who in the years to come are going to lead our
scientific and technological development 
""
Now this aspect  well thought out by our national
leaders even before we became independent 
""
The  owes a great
deal 
""
Even before  of
pre-independence 
uh Indian National Congresses he had outlined our policies  in nineteen
hundred forty-six when his  came out
""
that the social  upliftment of the people was not possible unless a basic
scientific policy was designed 
""
And 
Discovery of India  let you know what his thinking
was  It is science alone that can
 of insanitation and
illiteracy  of
vast resources running to waste  of a rich country inhabitate by starving
""
""
And therefore  looking at all the problems he tried to set
right the scientific background 
""
And while  setting right the scientific background he did not
 in terms of say
 the need of what is known as
the scientific temper 
""
So the very basis of the science and technology policy as
visualized by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru  was the development of a scientific
temper 
""
Even  uh applied and it basically
means that you should be able to think in a logical manner  you should be
able to find out what are the next steps you are going to do and what that is
going to lead to 
""
Whether your uh  whether
they can be  or not supported that is what the scientific
attitude or the scientific temper or the scientific way of thinking means 
and that is what he emphasised
""
So the basic  you should first
learn 
""
Now with this  to
creating 
""
Firstly we all know that  said that we have got to
provide better technologies which would enable the country to progress more
rapidly 
""
The  had its
own symbolic value
""
It had its value as far as the villages were 
""
""
But  we
would not survive in the world of competition
""
And therefore for a even  a
""
charkha  or it
was known as the 
""
Similarly he said about building 
""
Uh 
 up heavy industries
""
In fact  the knowledge that the storage of water was essential
for our agricultural development  led to our policy of big dams
""
It was at that time in the early uh the late uh  uh
late forties and early fifties that we thought of Hirakud and uh  Bhakra
and so on 
""
And in those days he emphasised that dams  are the
temples of modern India
""
He did not want people to go  uh to uh a temple in the religious
way think of a temple in a religious way but he thought that objects 
which  a symbol of
progress should be our real temples 
""
At the same time he  setting up large research
laboratories
""
The first was of course  the National Chemical Laboratory at
Poona then you have the National Physical Laboratory and a chain of National
Laboratories came 
""
Today  and there is who think that these
steps were probably not in our best interest
""
For example  uh you may say that a dam probably gave us water
it probably gave us electricity but it did not take care of the ecological
aspects or of the environmental aspects 
""
You can say  created certain
small centres of excellence but the money poured into the national laboratory
 deprived you can say the university
""
These are things  which we find in hind-side
""
But it is the fore-sight that you have got to build up a scientific
base  our
development 
""
And in terms of this uh  the first thing that
India did  was in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight when it adopted what
was known 
""
Do you mind if I  ?
""
Because they will otherwise not be able to take down anything ahn
""
""
It was at this point  we adopted in nineteen hundred
and fifty-eight 
resolution 
""
Now this scientific policy 
resolution  was aimed at providing the basis for our scientific
programmes in future 
""
Now what are the main points of this scientific policy resolution ?
""
The first major point was  and
sustain the cultivation of science  and scientific research in all aspects
""
""
So  framework or
the main bullwork on which our science policy was based 
""
The second point was  of
research scientist of high quality 
""
It was this was also considered necessary not only the scientific
equipment but the scientific personnel 
""
The third  with
all possible speed  programmes for the training of scientific and
technical persons 
""
The next was  is encouraged
""
""
And  encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and
desimination of knowledge and for discovery of new knowledge 
""
And lastly  all the
benefits that can accrue  and application of
scientific knowledge 
""
So these are the points which I will give you 
""
But here we have got to emphasis the fact that  what was
required was one  up the
scientific 
""
Second  personnel required
""
""
Third  scientific knowledge was
dessiminated to the people 
""
And above all what is most important  that any
scientific  did not lie in
science alone 
""
Now in much later you will find that uh  in the late eighties
this came out in the form of our technological mission which I will talk to
about later 
""
But the building up of the infrastructure  the building up of
the personnel require  the
transformation of the benefits of science  popu
 thrust or the
main  basis of our science policy as formulated in nineteen hundred and
fifty-eight 
""
Uh 
scientific policy resolution which the  adopted was
""
""
""
So the next step came  nineteen hundred and
seventy-three 
was formed to advise on how  the scientific achievements or the scientific
material could be transferred into technology
""
And that is when 
""
Now this 
presented an approach paper 
""
So this is the science and technology 
""
And this science and technology committee report  emphasised
again four or five points  the resources
allotted to research and development in India  and other developing
countries were grossly inadequate
""
That was the first point 
""
The second  from
developed countries 
""
Thirdly 
developed 
""
Fourthly  quality and relevance of education in schools and
universities  the stupendest waste
in human resources 
""
And  an adequate machinery had to be set up to monitor
 and redirect various programmes in science and
""
""
Now  the basic points of the report of the
nineteen hundred and seventy-three science and technology committee  you
will find that they said what we are still saying in nineteen hundred and
ninety-one that is the eighteen years later 
""
We are not saying anything  we are again stating
the same fact that we don't have enough money for research  that we should
not import technology from outside  we should develop our own technology
 that an adequate
machinery should be  formed to transfer the benefits of science to society
""
""
So in other words  though our thinking process have been proper
 though we know the path
on which we have to travel 
""
And this  uh that out my opening
remarks  that what is necessary is not only a science and technology
policy  but the environment to promote that policy and the personnel to
promote the policy 
""
If after twenty years  to
 uh a long time back then
there is something wrong  and that wrong is that we have not developed the
right  take place
""
""
Then 
three  as the technology
policy statement 
""
Now this technology policy  say
what should be our programmes of technological development 
""
And this is essentially something  which is more or less a
repeat 
policy 
""
So the government issued in nineteen eighty-three the technology
policy statement 
nation's  development
of indigenous technology 
""
Second  acquisition of imported technology and its efficient
absorption  and adaption appropriate to national priorities and resources
""
