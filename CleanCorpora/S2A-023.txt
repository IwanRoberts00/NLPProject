Chalk  with a chalk in my hand and a black board at my
""
""
But uh  this is some sort of a formal lecture in a sense that I
""
""
""
""
universities in its implementation 
""
While choosing this topic I had two view points 
""
""
know 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
request of what you should really be doing 
""
""
from the beginning  you have
""
""
patterns have changed 
""
You  as I said you could start with the invention of the wheel
""
""
computer 
""
""
programmes 
""
""
Europe  highlighted the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 and if you have got a trained
""
""
""
every aspect of life take even our teaching programmes 
""
""
""
""
We also  know that all these things must be taught
""
But unless  the whole atmosphere in the university is such that
""
capable of teaching we find that 
""
""
considering any policy and in this case the science and technology policy is
""
""
Thus  you will find that when we finally come to the
implementation  the brunt will have to come
""
""
""
later  uh act and who who in the years to come are going to lead our
scientific and technological development 
""
""
""
""
""
deal 
""
""
pre-independence 
""
""
""
that the social  upliftment of the people was not possible unless a basic
""
""
""
""
was  It is science alone that can
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the scientific temper 
""
""
visualized by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru  was the development of a scientific
temper 
""
""
means that you should be able to think in a logical manner  you should be
able to find out what are the next steps you are going to do and what that is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
creating 
""
""
""
""
""
The  had its
""
""
""
""
""
But  we
""
""
""
""
""
was known as the 
""
""
""
""
 up heavy industries
""
In fact  the knowledge that the storage of water was essential
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
way think of a temple in a religious way but he thought that objects 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Laboratories came 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You can say  created certain
""
 deprived you can say the university
""
""
""
""
base  our
""
""
And in terms of this uh  the first thing that
""
""
""
""
""
Because they will otherwise not be able to take down anything ahn
""
""
It was at this point  we adopted in nineteen hundred
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The first major point was  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
all possible speed  programmes for the training of scientific and
""
""
The next was  is encouraged
""
""
And  encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But here we have got to emphasis the fact that  what was
required was one  up the
scientific 
""
""
""
""
""
dessiminated to the people 
""
And above all what is most important  that any
""
""
""
""
""
about later 
""
But the building up of the infrastructure  the building up of
""
transformation of the benefits of science  popu
 thrust or the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this 
""
""
""
""
And this science and technology committee report  emphasised
""
allotted to research and development in India  and other developing
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
universities  the stupendest waste
in human resources 
""
And  an adequate machinery had to be set up to monitor
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that an adequate
""
""
""
So in other words  though our thinking process have been proper
""
""
""
And this  uh that out my opening
""
""
promote the policy 
""
""
 uh a long time back then
there is something wrong  and that wrong is that we have not developed the
""
""
""
""
three  as the technology
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
policy statement
