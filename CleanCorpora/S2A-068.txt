Just wait uh 
Ah ha make this Your Honour uhm 
Your Honour in this case the accused has been charged under
section three hundred and two of the Indian penal code 
In this case clears throat the case is principally of
 this is a case of what is called circumstantial evidence 
This is a case of circumstantial evidence 
In all matters the relevant definition is the definition of the
word prove 
The definition is the definition of the word prove and that
definition is always relevant and I'm reading that definition
 A fact is said to be proved when after considering the
matters before it the court either believes it to exist or
considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought under
the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that
it exist 
In other words the definition of the word prove in section
three of the Evidence Act is a standard which is officially
laid down for the purposes of highly given proof 
This was later adopted in one case to which I will not come in this
case I will come in a later case 
Your Honour actually whether a given case is proved or not 
has got to be admeasured with reference to this particular definition 
In general sense
This 
In general sense 
This particular definition section three 
Now section three relates to three types of evidence actually
The evidence can be direct the evidence can be circumstantial
 and the evidence can be partly circumstantial and partly direct 
But the standard with reference to which the proof of a case
has got to be assessed is in section three 
The standard with reference to which the proof of a given case
has got to be assessed is section three 
On section three as I said there are three types of evidence
 direct circumstantial partly direct and partly circumstantial
Now as regards circumstantial evidence the Supreme Court has
 laid down certain guidelines 
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law
 that must be understood 
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law
 they're to be respected but they are not binding in
the sense in which the interpretation of law is binding 
They are to be respected 
The reason is this
What is the citation
No I'm I'm coming to that citation is different 
Yes ci you know that that is year nineteen sixty
Supreme Court page one nine zero 
I will give Your Honour later on 
Page 
One nine zero 
My god this offence
One nine zero
Yes 
Your Honour one nine five 
Decisions even of the highest court on questions which are
essential questions of facts cannot be called as precedents governing
the decisions of other cases which must rest in the ultimate
analysis upon their own particular facts 
The general principles governing the appreciation of circumstantial
evidence are well established and the and the broad 
and beyond doubt or controversial 
The more difficult question is one of applying this principles to
the bare fact and circumstances of a particular case 
Your Honour the point which we are trying to make out is this
 those general principles are known 
What is necessary is actually both application of
this particular principles and taking the spirit of that particular
principles and not the literal words 
 I'll come to that and explain 
From the first ever case after the birth of Supreme Court in
nineteen fifty-two was what is called the Hanumanta's case 
In year nineteen fifty-two Supreme Court page three forty-three
Now here he is going to use it against me and I know it 
No no it's alright 
Continue it 
Supreme Court 
On page ?
Three four three 
That was the first ever Supreme Court case which laid
down the general guiding principles as regards circumstantial evidence 
And what the Supreme Court in that particular case said was this
 
The main three principles which were laid down there in that
particular case were that the facts must be first established 
They must have what is called the conclusive tendency and
they must be incompatable with any other hypothesis except 
that of guilt 
These are the three basic principles which were laid down in
 Hanumanta's case 
And in the light of the principles which were laid down in 
Sup by the Supreme Court in that particular case clears
throat we shall try to assess whether in this case the facts
 cumulatively drive this particular court to the conclusion that the
accused and the accused alone has committed that crime 
Your Honour has followed 
Now let us go through the first case 
So I will just 
Yes 
Your Honour the first point is this P W six and P W
seven were the office bearers of Pushpavila's 
Co-operative Housing Society 
Yes 
I have established 
Ah 
Have established that on the twenty-seventh of July
nineteen ninety-one the accused was functioning as a watchman of
that particular building 
One 
That is the first point 
Yes
And being a watchman and being on duty from nine am
 on that onwards he was expected to be on duty throughout the
day 
Expected to be duty on 
Throughout the day 
Yes 
Number two 
Yes 
Being a watchman he had an easy access to all the tenements
 of that building 
Now this is very important 
Yes 
This is important for this reason that no lady who is all
by herself in a flat will open the flat to an outsider 
No lady who is all alone in the flat will open the
flat to an outsider but will readily open it to a watchman 
whose duty it is to protect them 
Yes
Third 
Since he was expected to be on duty throughout the day
 he was expected to be available for help after murder
Not yet 
After 
Supposing he has not committed murder someone else has
committed murder and he is on duty 
So he was not here
It is he who is supposed to help that is what I am trying
to say 
Being on duty he was expected to help 
Yes 
Being a watchman 
Yes 
He was not only not available but was missing 
and had to be traced through efforts 
Your next point 
He was not only not available but was missing and had to
be traced through efforts 
Yes 
According to P W seven who is the Chairman of the society 
according to P W seven who is the Chairman of the society 
Yes 
This is at page twenty-three 
Yes
He was wearing that check shirt which is article seven on
that day 
 A few words 
When he was on duty 
Both P W six and P W seven 
This is article 
Seven 
Article seven 
Your Honour this is very important I will give the list
afterward 
Article seven was stained with group blood
 A group A according to
the C A report 
What is uh the group of uh deceased ?
 A Your Honour blood group of
deceased was A because according to exhibit
twenty-nine 
Yes twenty-nine is a exhibit
According to exhibit twenty-nine 
C A report
C A report 
The saree the petticoat the blouse the
brassiere the curtain and the piece of curtain there are as many as 
one two three four five six items which had A
 group 
Your Honour may take it down the saree 
article three 
Blouse 
The no no we'll go in order uh Your Honour 
 Saree article three 
Petticoat article four 
Petticoat 
Blouse article five brassiere article six 
Yes
And curtain article two all these items bore
 A group and therefore I say that the blood
group of the deceased was A although when the blood
 was taken and sent to the chemical analyser independently he
could not say
 Saree was wet
No no no the blood of the deceased was taken by
the doctor he could not conclusively say what group it belonged to
because perhaps it had disintegrated 
It happens sometimes that a given portion is disintegrated 
but I say
Blood was taken
Yes also taken 
But he could not express an opinion as regards the blood group 
But I say that the deceased had A group
by virtue of the fact that all these items had A group
has Your Honour followed this 
This is at twenty-nine exhibit twenty-nine will show this
Have you examine the group blood of the accused
Yes that is also A 
That is
 A 
That is also A 
That is exactly I will let let me complete the argument 
One minute 
Your Honour the point is although the blood group of the
deceased according to exhibit thirty-one thirty-one is
 A 
Deceased 
No no accused accused his blood group the blood
group of the accused is A 
The blood group of the deceased also is A 
According to this according to this you mean the mark
 this is therefore of 
Yes that is the blood of the accused that is
 A 
I have taken care to ask the police officer at page
thirty-eight para three I have taken the special care and 
I'll read that 
Earlier on twenty-nine seven ninety-one we had sent the
accused to the hospital for obtaining blood 
When the accused was first arrested there were no injuries on
the person of the accused 
 That's the point
That is why this answer was taken 
Your Honour I'm very vigilant about my duties
According to
 I'm very vigilant about my duties
Have you established
No no Your Honour we'll go to him later on I mean
 Two words 
Otherwise my link will be broken
 Two words 
No no 
 Two words 
Your Honour I'm not anxious to prove his blood
lying on the saree I'm anxious to prove his blood
lying on his own shirt that is what I'm trying to say 
He could have well pleaded that he was injured and therfore he
could have well explained
But both on
No no that is the main thing that is my argument that is not
Whole circumstances uh
No no no Your Honour allow me to complete otherwise the whole
thing will be 
Yes
Your Honour article seven had blood group A
 since he was not injured and since he was wearing that
shirt the blood of the deceased has spurted on him that is what 
I'm trying to say 
The blood of the deceased had spurted on him the blood of the
deceased has spurted on him on two items 
According to the exhibit twenty-nine let me just add and
it was here at page thirty-eight when he started the cross examination
 my learned friend should have asked the police officer 
Yes 
And cross examined this police officer on the point of there
being an injury 
He should have asked the police officer 
And he should have put the case to the police officer that
the accused was also injured 
That is the main point in this case 
And he did not do that 
Now the point which I am trying to make out there are two items on
which the blood group is A article seven is one
 and article 
Two two seven but it have
No no 
On article seven is a shirt
Shirt
Shirt no no we'll forget Your Honour the
deceased the blood on the deceased we'll forget because since she is
stabbed it is going to be full of blood 
We are trying to book him and therefore the blood on him
is relevant blood on the saree is not relevant at all it
is bound to be stained with blood 
Total there are fifteen injuries on the lady so that is that
presents more difficulty 
The blood on the saree the blouse the petticoat
and it is bound to be there 
What about him 
May I
No no please please
He says he has have had
No no no you don't help anybody when I'm 
I'm addressing I don't do you help yourself I can take care of
myself 
Your honour there are two items let it be very clear 
there were two items on which the blood group on his person was 
 A one is this shirt which he was wearing on the
twenty-seventh when he was on duty at that building and when from
which he ran away that is one 
And the second is the shirt which he wore when he was
arrested at Bombay Central police station and came back and which was
taken on the mo taken charge of on the morning of twenty-eighth
 which is article thirty-three
