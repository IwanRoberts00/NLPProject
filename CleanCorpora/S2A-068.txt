Just wait uh 
""
""
Ah ha make this Your Honour 
""
""
Your Honour in this case the accused has been charged under
section three hundred and two of the Indian penal code 
""
In this case  the case is principally of
""
""
This is a case of circumstantial evidence 
""
In all matters  the relevant definition is the definition of the
word prove 
""
The definition is the definition of the word prove  and that
definition is always relevant  reading that definition
""
""
 when after considering the
matters before it  or
considers its existence so probable  under
the circumstances of the particular case  to act upon the supposition that
it exist 
""
In other words  prove in section
three of the Evidence Act  standard which is officially
laid down 
""
This was later adopted in one case to which I will not come in this
case I will come in a later case 
""
Your Honour actually 
has got to be admeasured with reference to this particular definition 
""
""
In general sense
""
""
This 
""
""
In general sense 
""
""
This particular definition 
""
Now section three  relates to three types of evidence actually
""
""
The evidence can be direct  the evidence can be circumstantial
""
""
But the standard with reference to which  the proof of a case
has got to be assessed 
""
The standard with reference to which  the proof of a given case
has got to be assessed 
""
On section three  as I said there are three types of evidence
 partly direct and partly circumstantial
""
""
Now as regards circumstantial evidence  the Supreme Court has
""
""
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation  and not law
""
""
Those guidelines are in the region of appreciation  and not law
 but they are not binding in
the sense in which 
""
They are to be respected 
""
The reason is this
""
""
What is the citation
""
""
No 
""
Yes  that is year nineteen sixty
Supreme Court page one nine zero 
""
I will give Your Honour later on 
""

Page 
""
""
One nine zero 
""
My god this  offence
""
""
One nine zero
""
""
Yes 
""
Your Honour one nine five 
""
Decisions even of the highest court  on questions which are
essential questions of facts  cannot be called as precedents governing
the decisions of other cases  in the ultimate
analysis 
""
The general principles governing the appreciation of circumstantial
evidence 
and beyond doubt 
""
The more difficult question is one of applying this principles to
the bare fact and circumstances 
""
Your Honour the point which we are trying to make out is  this
""
""
What is necessary is  application of
this particular principles  and taking the spirit of that particular
principles and not the literal words 
""
""
""
From the first ever case  after the birth of Supreme Court in
nineteen fifty-two 
""
In year nineteen fifty-two Supreme Court page three forty-three
""
Now here he is going to use it against me and I know it 
""
""
No no 
""
""
Continue it 
""
""
Supreme Court 
""
""
On page  ?
""
""
Three four three 
""
That was the first ever  which laid
down the general guiding principles as regards circumstantial evidence 
""
And what the Supreme Court in that particular case said was this
""
""
The main three principles which were laid down there  in that
particular case were 
""
They  and
they must 
that of guilt 
""
These are the three basic principles which were laid down  in
""
""
And 
Sup  clears
throat  the facts
 to the conclusion that the
accused and the accused alone has committed that crime 
""
Your Honour has followed 
""
Now let us go through the first case 
""
So I will just 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Your Honour the first point is this  and P W
seven 
Co-operative Housing Society 
""

""
""
I have established 
""
""
Ah 
""
""
Have established  that on the twenty-seventh of July
nineteen ninety-one  was functioning as a watchman of
that particular building

""
And being a watchman  from nine am

day 
""
""
Expected to be duty on 
""
""
Throughout the day 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Number two 
""
""

""
""
Being a watchman he had an easy access to all the tenements
""
""
Now this is very important 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
This is important for this reason  that no lady who is all
by herself in a flat 
""
No lady  the
flat to an outsider 
whose duty it is to protect them 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Third 
""
Since he was expected to be  throughout the day
 after murder
""
""
""
Not yet 
""
""
After 
""
""
Supposing he has not committed murder  someone else has
committed murder 
""
""
So he was not here
""
""
It is he who is supposed to help  that is what I am trying
to say 
""
Being on duty 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Being a watchman 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
He was not only 
and had to be traced 
""
Your next point 
""
He was not only not available  and had to
be traced 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
According to P W seven who is the Chairman of the society 
according to P W seven

""
""
""
""
""
When he was on duty

Both P W six and P W seven

C A report

The  the
brassiere the curtain and the piece of curtain 
one two three four five  A
""
""
Your Honour may take it down 
article three 
""
""
Blouse 
""
""
The no no 
""
""
""
""
""
Petticoat article four 
""
""
Petticoat 
""
""
Blouse article five 
""
""
Yes
""
""
And curtain article two  bore
 that the blood
group of the deceased was  when the blood
 he
could not  say
""
""
 was wet
""
""
No no no  by
the doctor  he could not conclusively say what group it belonged to
because perhaps 
""
It happens sometimes 
but I say
""
""
Blood was taken
""
""
Yes also taken 
""
But he could not express an opinion as regards the blood group 
""
But I say that the deceased  group
by virtue of the fact that all these items had  group
has Your Honour followed this 
""
This is at twenty-nine  exhibit twenty-nine will show this
""
""
""
Have you examine the group blood of the accused
""
""
Yes that is also A 
""
""
That is
""
""
""
""
""
That is also 
""
""
That is exactly I will let let me complete the argument 
""
""
One minute 
""
""
Your Honour the point is  although the blood group of the
deceased  is
""
""
""
Deceased 
""
""
No no accused  the blood
group of the accused is 
""
The blood group of the deceased also is 
""
""
""
According to this according to this you mean the  mark
""
""
""
Yes  that is
""
""
I have taken care to ask  at page
thirty-eight 
I'll 
""
Earlier on twenty-nine seven ninety-one  we had sent the
accused to the hospital for obtaining blood 
""
When the accused was first arrested  there were no injuries on
the person of the accused 
""
 the point
""
That is why this answer was taken 
""
Your Honour  very vigilant about my duties
""
""
According to
""
""
 very vigilant about my duties
""
""
Have you established
""
""
No no Your Honour  go to him later on I mean
""
""
""
""
""
Otherwise my link will be broken
""
""
""
""
""
No no 
""
""
""
""
""
Your Honour  his blood
lying on the  anxious to prove his blood
lying on his own shirt 
""
He could have well pleaded that he was injured  and therfore he
could have well explained
""
""
But both on
""
""
No no that is the main thing that is my argument that is not
""
""
Whole circumstances uh
""
""
No no no Your Honour allow me to complete otherwise the whole
thing will be 
""
""
Yes
""
""
Your Honour article seven had blood group  A
 and since he was wearing that
shirt 
I'm 
""
The blood of the deceased had spurted on him  the blood of the
deceased has spurted on him on two items 
""
According to the exhibit twenty-nine  and
it was here at page thirty-eight  when he started the cross examination
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
And cross examined this police officer on the point of there
being an injury 
""
He should have asked the police officer 
""
And  to the police officer that
the accused was also injured 
""
That is the main point in this case 
""
And he did not do that 
""
Now the point which I am trying to make out there are two items on
which  article seven is one
""
""
""
Two two seven  but it have
""
""
No no 
""
""
On article seven is a shirt
""
""
Shirt
""
""
Shirt no no  the
deceased the blood on the deceased  forget because since she is
stabbed it is going to be full of blood 
""
We are trying to  and therefore the blood on him
is relevant  is not relevant at all it
is bound to be stained with blood 
""
Total there are fifteen injuries on the lady  so that is that
presents more difficulty 
""
The blood on the  the blouse the petticoat
and it is bound to be there 
""
What about him 
""
""
May I
""
""
No no please  please
""
""
He says he has have had
""
""
No no no you don't help anybody when 
I'm  I can take care of
myself 
""
Your honour there are two items 
there were two items on which 
 this shirt which he was wearing on the
twenty-seventh  and when from
which he ran away 
""
And the second is  when he was
arrested at Bombay Central police station  and which was
taken  taken charge of on the morning of twenty-eighth
