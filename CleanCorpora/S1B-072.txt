In the absence of  who
had been the guiding spirit  of text books
""
""
During his absence  to select
some passages 
""
I now welcomes him 
to take the reins in his hand 
""
So  I
would  and
 available

selected

I

According to the plan  the board of studies
in English 
English 
""
Uh we have  the first unit
is called informative writing 
""
The second one is note-making 
""
Third unit is distance communication 
""
But the final decision is not yet taken regarding this one 
""
The fourth unit is  reading and responding to advertisements
""
""
Workshop is to be done 
""
And the fifth one is reading newspaper 
""
Almost  as far as this
particular 
""
And  regarding the selection
that has been made  items that have
appeared 
""
As we all know 
civilized society 
""
Without newspaper  of what has
happened  their
own village or town 
""
And so we thought it 
introduced  for the benefit of
""
""
We have selected 
according to their sections 
""
The sections may be 
""
One short news 
""
Other forms 
""
And  the
newspaper 
""
And then another  to
the understanding of what has been happening around us 
""
The first one of these  is about an accident which took place
in Bengal  in the coal mine
""
""
It might have been due to the fire that broke out 
due to 
""
""
Several bodies have been recovered  where the final report is
not yet available 
""
But then every one has said that about forty-one  miners were
killed 
""
Second one is from  the letters to the
editor 
""
One writes it about Highway Development 
""
Taking into consideration all development that have been made 
recent years 
""
The 
perhaps generations behind  our Asian countries
particularly 
""
They have forged far ahead of us  the
highways 
""
So here  developments that have
been taken by  the highways
""
""
The last two of it  giving
information regarding  for the
budget session was opened on the last day of the session 
""
The information is given earlier  and what items could be
included 
""
We shall come back to it
""
""
""
Unit six deals with persuading  others will speak
""
""
And seventh unit narrating  spoken
about by 
""
And then we come to imaginative writing 
""
And which contains 
""
And the last section is  which particularly
full of short 
""
And in the earlier section  we have
selected 
""
Out of ten I will present  two or
three poems 
""
And in this  by
George Herbert 
""
It tells about  generation and regeneration
""
""
""
I'll 
""
""
 pass over
""
""
Pass over 
""
""
And the next one is 
""
I feel  the
environmental  is almost
similar to 
""
Before storm comes  lull
before the storm 
""
And children gather  and the coming sign of
storm 
""
They are calling them  but the children don't listen
to them
""
For children love the storm 
""
And suddenly  people are
there in their houses 
""
Storm raises  lightning is there and
suddenly it starts pouring down 
""
And  playing out in the rain
""
That is a poem  which is also very
relevant 
""
After this we go to 
""
 two or three
""
""
Fine 
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Uh selected 
""
One is  The Cop and the
Anthem 
""
This is typical Henrian  having a twist in
the tale 
""
You know how that is 
""
Here  he is now
facing 
""
As the winter was approaching 
warm shelter from that 
""
The best idea was to go back to prison  he would get
some warm corner there 
""
But unfortunately all his efforts  in trying to go back to the
prison 
""
Sincere efforts at that  when all these things
failed 
""
And he felt certain trasformation 
""
So he decided 
his 
""
But the moment this transformation came  next came the hand of a
cop 
he says 
""
""
""
""
""
And the last one that  is
""
""
 to our
memories 
story viewers also have written on Nightingale 
""
This one is 
""
This a lengthy story  Nightingale
bird  shores
""
""
There was an emperor  all the
greatest things in the world 
""
And then somehow he comes to know  there is a
wonderful bird 
""
He likes to hear that 
""
Ultimately the girl who had heard it first  persuade this bird
 court
""
""
And then  to the satisfaction of the great
emperor 
""
And  with
all the amenities 
as a court singer 
""
The bird everyday goes on singing 
""
But this she cannot continue for a long time  the bird is also
mortal being 
""
And so  a genius was there
""
exactly as Nightingale 
""
When the button was on  it will go on singing like Nightingale
""
""
And the people appreciated him 
""
And then everyone neglected this bird 
""
And the bird felt very sad 
""
And it flew away 
""
And then once this machine is  gets out of order
 melodious song as
before 
""
Then the emperor 
""
And on account of this he fell ill 
""
People went in search of the bird they could not find 
""
Ultimately 
prays the bird  the emperor was on his
death bed 
""
The bird comes  of
the window 
""
The emperor very much 
""
He only said that  one word
""
once in a week 
""
So this is the story of Nightingale
