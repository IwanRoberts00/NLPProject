<I>
In the absence of Dr Shastri for some time who
had been the guiding spirit for the preparation of text books
 from nineth to twelfth 
During his absence we have done our best to select
some passages 
I now welcomes him I we we welcome him to 
to take the reins in his hand 
So just to take a review of what we've done I
would like to request professor Patil-Kulkarni and
 Principal Krishnamurthy to make us rather available
 the list of the articles or the passages that have been 
selected 
I request Patil-Kulkarni to give the brief 
According to the plan evolved by the board of studies
in English of said board of secondary and higher secondary 
English Pune 
Uh we have in all seven units of which the first unit
is called informative writing 
The second one is note-making 
Third unit is distance communication 
But the final decision is not yet taken regarding this one 
The fourth unit is reading and responding to advertisements
Workshop is to be done in this next week 
And the fifth one is reading newspaper 
Almost complete selection has been made as far as this
particular unit is concerned 
And I may speak a few words regarding the selection
that has been made and the contents of various items that have
appeared under this unit reading the Newspaper 
As we all know newspaper forms an essential part of 
civilized society 
Without newspaper people will be in dark of what has
happened been happening all over the world and around their
own village or town 
And so we thought it essential to intr 
introduced introduce this one unit for the benefit of
 the students studying in twelfth standard 
We have selected a various articles 
according to their sections 
The sections may be alright interruption 
One short news another letters to the editor 
Other forms a report 
And one form uh the editorial section of the
newspaper 
And then another spot news all these are relevant to
the understanding of what has been happening around us 
The first one of these is about an accident which took place
in Bengal and about forty-one people were killed in the coal mine
It might have been due to the fire that broke out and also 
due to carbon monoxide which they breathe and then they died 
 cough 
Several bodies have been recovered where the final report is
not yet available 
But then every one has said that about forty-one miners were
killed 
Second one is from one word to the letters to the
editor 
One writes it about Highway Development 
Taking into consideration all development that have been made 
recent years 
The writer opines that we are lagging far behind 
perhaps generations behind the other countries our Asian countries
particularly Singapore Indonesia Malaysia etcetera 
They have forged far ahead of us in the maintenance of the
highways 
So here presented a few developments that have
been taken by the government of India in maintaining the highways
The last two of it is consist spot news giving
information regarding what's happening at the centre for the
budget session was opened on the last day of the session 
The information is given earlier and what items could be
included into the session into the small views mentioned 
We shall come back to it
 That's about unit five 
Unit six deals with persuading for which others will speak
And seventh unit narrating would be at spoken
about by some other person 
And then we come to imaginative writing section two 
And which contains poems and other imaginative things 
And the last section is rapid reading which particularly
full of short short stories 
And in the earlier section imaginative writing we have
selected a number of poems 
Out of ten I will present only three poems only two or
three poems 
And in this another one Pulley by
George Herbert which many of the people already know about it 
It tells about the human being generation and regeneration
 and the humanisation or whatever it is in this world 
 They're known to each and everyone I don't think 
I'll spent much time on this 
 You can pass pass over
Pass over 
And the next one is uh by a black poet Oleghe 
I feel A Sudden Storm the
environmental situation presented in this poem is almost
similar to Indian environment 
Before storm comes rain comes there is a lull lull
before the storm 
And children gather in that lull and the coming sign of
storm people are worried they go in search of their children 
They are calling them of but the children don't listen
to them
For children love the storm and it is about to rain 
And suddenly when all the winds are cleared people are
there in their houses 
Storm raises thunder takes over lightning is there and
suddenly it starts pouring down 
And children enjoy themselves playing out in the rain
That is a poem by a black poet which is also very
relevant of Indian one word 
After this we go to the rapid reading section uh 
 I'll speak on only two or three
Fine 
Uh haan 
Yeah 
Uh selected stories 
One is the well known story The Cop and the
Anthem by O Henry 
This is typical Henrian uh short story having a twist in
the tale 
You know how that is 
Here a one word convict Soapy he is now
facing an ordeal 
As the winter was approaching he wanted to find a shelter 
warm shelter from that interruption 
The best idea was to go back to prison so that he would get
some warm corner there 
But unfortunately all his efforts in trying to go back to the
prison failed 
Sincere efforts at that but then when all these things
failed he comes near a church where prayer was going on 
And he felt certain trasformation 
So he decided to live a honest life put an end to 
his stop this stealing business 
But the moment this transformation came next came the hand of a
cop on his shoulder one word what are you doing here 
he says nothing 
 One word 
And the last one that I'm discussing on is
 The Nightingale 
 Nightingale again brings to to our
memories various feelings that we pines for Nightingale and 
story viewers also have written on Nightingale 
This one is by Hans Anderson 
This a lengthy story telling about a bird Nightingale
bird who sings sweetly in some remote corner on the shores
There was an emperor Chinese emperor who has all the
greatest things in the world in his empire in his court 
And then somehow he comes to know casually there is a
wonderful bird singing a very melodious song day and night 
He likes to hear that 
Ultimately the girl who had heard it first persuade this bird
 to comes come to King's court
And then the bird sings to the satisfaction of the great
emperor 
And this emperor makes a golden cage for it with
all the amenities and a place a designation in the court honour 
as a court singer 
The bird everyday goes on singing 
But this she cannot continue for a long time the bird is also
mortal being 
And so to immortalise the song of a bird a genius was there
 scientist who made a machine which would reproduce the song 
exactly as Nightingale 
When the button was on it will go on singing like Nightingale
And the people appreciated him 
And then everyone neglected this bird original bird 
And the bird felt very sad 
And it flew away from 
And then once this machine is uh that gets out of order
 though it was repaired it could not produce the melodious song as
before 
Then the emperor felt that he was missing this music 
And on account of this he fell ill 
People went in search of the bird they could not find 
Ultimately the emperor thinks of Nightingale bird 
prays the bird to come back to emperor the emperor was on his
death bed so he is only saved by the song of the bird 
The bird comes two words from one word of
the window and then sings 
The emperor very much one word he started recovering 
He only said that we can talk again the whole one word
 but it'll come sometimes say once in a day 
once in a week to sing to the emperor one word 
So this is the story of Nightingale 
With these few one word I think I've spoken 
uh within the specified time that was given to me to review the
items that have been selected for this particular book for standard
English text book which commence from ninety-five June thank
you 
Thank you sir 
Infact I'm divided between recording broken 
these are I should compliment you or offer my thanks 
I began that uh you are going to give a kind of
report and it was rather a kind of prosiac begining I think 
And now I think when I heard your review of the 
units that you have selected I rather feel that I've 
 travelled through the realms of gold 
Thank you thank you now
Thank you Mr Kaned for this opportunity given to me 
to review a few of the lessons selected by us for uh the
twelfth class English text 
I begin with uh rapid reading section 
We have selected about uh ten stories 
And I feel the main considerations behind the selection
of these stories are number one the sustained interest 
Two suitability for the age group 
Three the moral orientation the story may have 
And lastly the variety 
Of these stories I take first Fate a Woman 
and a Ruby 
It is a detective story from the files of Cecil Bishop
 C I D Scotland Yard 
The story narrates in a very gripping manner 
how Bishop was able to find out the lost ruby 
In this he makes several efforts 
And a woman came to his uh age aid 
But even after uh very long search almost he
gave up hope at that moment Fate came to his uh aid 
And with the help of the Fate he was able in the end 
to detect this uh lost ruby 
 It's a very fine absorbing detective story
But second story that I've selected is The
Accursed House by Emile Gaboriau 
It is a story on human psychology 
Vicomte reduces the rents of the buildings with very
good intention of helping the tenants 
But unfortunately this intention was misunderstood 
and the people began to smell something foul 
And they thought that there must be some other motive 
behind it 
And then one after the other all the tenants desert
the uh house 
And thus the house becomes an accursed house 
The third story The Fortune tellers 
which is a folk tale it tells about story of uh scholars 
who out of their greediness ruined themselves 
The fourth story is uh Foolish Friends 
 by Premchand one of the famous Indian short short story writer
He describes how sometimes even good friends 
with good intention may become embarrassing to the extent of even
ruining the people whom they want to help 
Here it is about few boys I mean two boys I mean one
boy and the girl who out of their curiosity and also out of their
intention to help them 
Uh eggs in the nest ultimately ruin it 
And the the next story Once Upon A Christmas
 by Pearl Buck 
He is very absorbing absorbingly narrated story of a boy 
who comes to the writer on the eve of uh Christmas 
And she adopts him she becomes grownup 
And he becomes a doctor 
And afterwards there were troubles in China China splits 
And uh Pearl Buck wanted to return home 
She wanted the boy also to accompany her 
But he refused 
And he wants to stay back in China doing self-less
service to the people 
She tells him that the communist may not allow him to do
the type of uh service 
But he says he is determined to stay whatever may happen
to him 
Ultimately he is uh shot dead 
And uh after these few stories I want to take up one
or two poems that I've uh the opportunity of selecting 
One is the poem What Kind of A Place
 
 What Kind of Place this is by Uma
Parmeshwaran 
This is a satire on uh modern life 
Now we find all the windows and the doors of the house
 shut 
And the curtains withdrawn
The curtains and no breeze comes in 
We don't have the opportunity of seeing uh the natural uh
beauty 
And uh even our way of life is so changed that there is
no distinction between man and uh woman as far as social life is
concerned
They move they move together they mix with each other 
which for an old father looks very odd 
And even cooking is done once for uh in a month 
And he expresses his displeasure for this life 
and uh he wants his son to open the windows and the door so that
he can have the opportunity to breathe fresh air and see 
nature in all its splendour 
And the next poem is The Whiner's Plaint
 in search of identity 
This poem is about an Indian who is not known as Indian
in his uh country but known as a Madrasi or a
Brahmin or a Hindu or a Muslim 
And uh he doesn't feel happy with these labels that are
attached to that persons 
And he wants to be known only as an Indian 
And these are the two poems on which I wanted to 
say a few words 
And thank you very much for this opportunity given two
words 
In fact story has been the first love of every
generation 
And uh with so much visualisation and uh rather so
much pain staking labour we have selected the stories with
variety of subjects 
And we feel no doubt that these would be very
interesting 
In fact the stories are interesting but the story
telling was also interesting 
And therefore for a moment we thought that the time 
had stopped 
When you switched to poetry and as I know 
that it is your first love and the way you said something
about the poem that you have selected has aroused curiosity in our
mind 
And it would be appreciated by the students at large 
I am reminded again of the one word seed 
that may sprout and flower when the text books comes into light
Thank you very much thank you
