Uh no you must get married because now you are twenty-six or
twenty-seven  time to marry
""
""
I think that  you should relax enjoy life the full
""
""
You know do you think that marriage  uh after marriage
you cannot relax
""
""
No I think  once we get married there are
more responsibilities
""
""
Uh
""
""
So I like to do a lot more things  before getting married
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But I have decided not to get married at all 
""
I have resolved not to marry at all
""
""
Oh don't do that 
""
You need company 
""
""
No we can have company no in our group
""
""
 get the opinion of a
married man 
""
Yeah what is in a marriage  ?
""
""
Uh yeah talk about this uh marriage and uh  celibacy
""
That means uh
""
""
Celibacy
""
""
""
""
""
You might not be you might not be married and you may not to
be a celibacy 
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
Forget that thing
""
What I mean is  without married
life  is it ?
""
""
Very good you are the one exception  you are the only one
""
""
Oh sir I didn't 
""
There are difficulties and uh problems 
 married
""
""
""
""
""
No I think 
when we have children  children to take care of
""
""
There are lots of problems but yet 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Wonderful
""
""
Married life  got uh precious
""
""
But I feel
""
""
But uh  yes yes
""
""
I think people after  married giving
birth to children  going to school this thing that thing so
many problems
""
""
""
""
""
So many problems and then so many expenses
""
The problems are there but also  there are pleasures in the
married life  you
don't get pleasures 
""
That you can remain 
""
""
I feel free 
""
""
 problems uh
""
""
I I feel free now
""
""
You may have got  uh problems
""
""
I am not tied I am free
""
""
Yes 
""
""
 there is the
pleasure in sharing in life
""
""
Sharing it with some one else
""
""
Companion
""
""
I am sharing my thoughts ideas with you
""
""
Yeah and when you get married 
""
You come into a close relations and uh  connections with so
many 
side 
""
""
""
""
""
So many people 
""
And you face a 
""
""
Lot of problems  in the list of problems
""
""
You get joy 
""
""
But I don't know
""
""
But I think sir 
""
Suppose  you get a okay understanding wife is okay
""
But suppose you get a different kind of wife a nagging wife from
the some one who just can't adjust with you
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Then marriage is not the
""
""
Then even you will be segregated from the society you
relatives as well as uh friends 
""
""
Always you must be 
""
""
You might be lucky sir
""
""
You must be optimistic
""
""
Oh yes yes yes
""
""
You should not think that you will get a nagging and  uh
obsessive  uh such kind of wife you get you should not think
""
""
Next thing 
""
People say that must you get me educated ladies atleast a graduate
or post graduate what is there in it 
""
""
No  all
goes to help 
""
For example okay  suppose
we do get married with someone who is not having any education 
""
There is a total difference between us
""
So you may not exactly  have a better a good understanding
""
""
My my father is an MA  see she
couldn't write at all 
""
They adjusted  they had a very good life
""
""
That is the matter 
uh she is not a 
""
""
 you what what your
""
""
She is not a graduate 
""
See the harmony of uh  uh is
not in 
""
Or  the
understanding between 
""
Both of them are seperate 
""
""
I think we stop talking about marriage 
""
There are two unmarried people 
""
""
You are the one married 
""
""
You may not uh think that uh only  the educated and uh
""
""
They alone can uh 
""
""
But on the other hand my both brother  and my
sister-in-law are both are educated 
""
They have problem
""
Even now everyday quarrel  what to do
""
""
 educated
as
""
""
So why should I 
""
""
Yeah how many in your  uh how many members in your family
are  ?
""
""
Uhm two or three  myself and my brother
""
""
""
""
""
Your father ?
""
""

""
""

""
""
Youngest son
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
No there are some so many
""
""
You see see movie ?
""
""
Normally I don't I don't go to movie 
""
I don't go to movies at all
""
""
Why  ?
""
""
Because he is married
""
""
 not been used to it because in
my family others are going  uh
that is 
""
""
In fact there is a  he is doing so
""
""
Okay 
""
""
Have you all that cultural entertainment 
that we have youngsters make it a point to see every movie that comes through
""
""
Not only entertainment 
uh a must isn't it  ?
""
""
Yeah 
especially in Madras  just
for that 
""
Okay too hot 
""
""
Okay theatre going it is sometime  we can have a nap there
""
""
In Madras to go and see a film  we need to spend a lot of
money 
fifteen 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Normally in Madras approximately atleast thirty 
rupees 
""
Very expensive per persons
""
""
And if we take a family 
""
""

 people going
to cinema  so what do you say ?
""
""
See  probably

Uhm every Sunday  either in
Tamil or in other languages

""
""
You know only
""
""
Uhm two or three films every Sunday  I mean Hindi film uh
there are 
""
""
That is a bad influence
""
""
Uhn
""
""
That is a bad influence
""
""
That is coming to 
""
""
You see this is the whole day spend on watching something or
the other  spoils education

I think children shouldn't be allowed 
""
""
There are many precautions 
""
""
Some problems that arise  for example family relations are
 not that family inter-relations
""
""
Okay father mother children 
whatever is on the TV they just sit to watch TV and  not much
of
