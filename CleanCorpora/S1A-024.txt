How is the teaching in a government school ?
Normally they say its standard is lower students are not very
 how is it ?
Uh standard because it depends upon the as you know this
socio environmental cultural uh region because uh people
from well most uh poverty stricken area are uh they're
 not well educated they are not from well educated family 
 That's the problem 
Uhm
But you don't face problems
No most of them are working in fields and uh farms
in the villages 
Uhn when are going to get married Mr Shellroy ?
Don't think of marriage just now laughter 
Uh no you must get married because now you are twenty-six or
twenty-seven it's time to marry
I think that you should relax enjoy life the full
You know do you think that marriage uh after marriage
you cannot relax
No I think you've once we get married there are
more responsibilities
Uh
So I like to do a lot more things before getting married
 A few words 
 So like for example Diploma 
But I have decided not to get married at all 
I have resolved not to marry at all
Oh don't do that 
You need company laughter 
No we can have company no in our group
 Let's get let's get the opinion of a
married man 
Yeah what is in a marriage ?
Uh yeah talk about this uh marriage and uh celibacy
That means uh
Celibacy
 He's not exactly laughter 
You might not be you might not be married and you may not to
be a celibacy 
Yeah yeah
Forget that thing
What I mean is uh there is no pleasure without married
life is it ?
Very good you are the one exception you are the only one
Oh sir I didn't one word 
There are difficulties and uh problems start only when you 
 uh get married
 Problems 
No I think uh we have some one else to take care of 
when we have children one word children to take care of
There are lots of problems but yet 
Uhm
Wonderful
Married life you've got uh precious
But I feel
But uh yes yes
I think people after getting married giving
birth to children I'm going to school this thing that thing so
many problems
 Because 
So many problems and then so many expenses
The problems are there but also there are pleasures in the
married life in the family life whereas in celibacy you
don't get pleasures 
That you can remain 
I feel free now 
 without problems uh
I I feel free now
You may have got uh problems
I am not tied I am free
Yes no problems 
 I think there is uh this there is the
pleasure in sharing in life
Sharing it with some one else
Companion
I am sharing my thoughts ideas with you
Yeah and when you get married 
You come into a close relations and uh connections with so
many uh relations of uh on your side on your wife's 
side 
 From wife's side 
So many people coming to contact with you 
And you face a 
Lot of problems in the list of problems
You get joy 
But I don't know
But I think sir it all depends on how your wife is 
Suppose you get a okay understanding wife is okay
But suppose you get a different kind of wife a nagging wife from
the some one who just can't adjust with you
Yeah
Then marriage is not the
Then even you will be segregated from the society you
relatives as well as uh friends 
Always you must be 
You might be lucky sir
You must be optimistic
Oh yes yes yes
You should not think that you will get a nagging and uh
obsessive uh such kind of wife you get you should not think
Next thing 
People say that must you get me educated ladies atleast a graduate
or post graduate what is there in it all are woman 
No graduation post graduation or it's all
goes to help someone who can understand us who can vibe with us 
For example okay we have done our MA and all that suppose
we do get married with someone who is not having any education 
There is a total difference between us
So you may not exactly have a better a good understanding
My my father is an MA my mother did not see she
couldn't write at all 
They adjusted they had a very good life
That is the matter that's what even my wife 
uh she is not a graduate 
 Uh you what what your
She is not a graduate 
See the harmony of uh marriage uh or married life uh is
not in education or not in other things 
Or one word money or uh it uh depends on the
understanding between that is likes and dislikes 
Both of them are seperate one or two words 
I think we stop talking about marriage 
There are two unmarried people laughter 
You are the one married a few words 
You may not uh think that uh only the educated and uh
 people who are working or earning are highly educated 
They alone can uh live happily otherwise all others 
But on the other hand my both brother and my
sister-in-law are both are educated 
They have problem
Even now everyday quarrel fight what to do
 It's all wife thinks a few words educated
as
So why should I 
Yeah how many in your uh how many members in your family
are uh post graduate ?
Uhm two or three your myself and my brother
 Your 
Your father ?
Father he was Post Graduate
What is he ?
Uh nothing he is a business man doing his uh farm
Oh oh I see and you are the younger son 
I am the youngest 
Youngest son
 A few words 
Ah so how about going for a movie you see 
Interested in going for movie lot of Tamil movies is going on
No your Tamil movies are one or two words 
No there are some so many
You see see movie ?
Normally I don't I don't go to movie 
I don't go to movies at all
Why ?
Because he is married
 I'm not I've not been used to it because in
my family others are going but my father because my mother being uh
that is one word 
In fact there is a one word he is doing so
Okay 
Have you all that cultural entertainment a few words 
that we have youngsters make it a point to see every movie that comes through
Not only entertainment it is it has became some what 
uh a must isn't it ?
Yeah a few words peoples in theatres 
especially in Madras when it's hot you go to theatres just
for that one word that's how we feel 
Okay too hot a few words 
Okay theatre going it is sometime we can have a nap there
In Madras to go and see a film we need to spend a lot of
money for per persons yes ten rupees 
fifteen rupees 
 Yes 
Uhm
Normally in Madras approximately atleast thirty 
rupees to go out to see a movie and come 
Very expensive per persons
And if we take a family 
 It'll go to hundred like a family one word
 advantage and disadvantages of it 
 But normally after the uhm T V programme
 uh coming to a the normal use and we don't find people going
to cinema so what do you say ?
See doordarshan is nothing much probably
Sunday evening you have to watch a movie
 A few words 
Uhm every Sunday two or three uhm films either in
Tamil or in other languages 
Ah yeah yeah they spoil story
Uhm 
You know only
Uhm two or three films every Sunday I mean Hindi film uh
there are and now that uh cable TV and other uh STAR TV 
That is a bad influence
Uhn
That is a bad influence
That is coming to 
You see this is the whole day spend on watching something or
the other spoils education
I think children shouldn't be allowed 
There are many precautions 
Some problems that arise for example family relations are
 uh there's not there's not that family inter-relations
 because before when people used to sit together and talk 
Okay father mother children the relations 
whatever is on the TV they just sit to watch TV and there's not much
of communication between them 
That is what
 The relations 
Yeah no understanding 
 There's the family relationship gets spoiled and they
get dispute I can say and collide something like that 
What about in your house do you you are these having
any
Uh we don't have any
Younger brother or sister
It is almost
Younger brother and younger sister in your house ?
I have never been at home for two days
You not got TV at all
No TV at all for my father is so strict that we didn't had a
TV because its one word 
Oh very nice
