Another Arjun award winner 
""
And of course we have the cricketing manager of the Indian side 
uh the third Arjun award winner 
""
Diana Eduljee 
""
Quite a delivery indeed  there on the crease
 are not
taking chances of leaving the crease 
""
Diana 
""
Left arm round 
""
No attempt for a shot 
""
And thirty nineth over completed with Diana completing her sixth
over two maiden ten runs and one wicket 
""
In just misfield you see Franklin and Jose now discussing as to the
strategy what should be adopted  at this stage of the game
""
The fortieth over  will be in progress
""
The run rate here  and
""
""
Two point four one
""
A very low 
""
Not a recitable total to bowl at
""
And Australia will have to do something about it right now 
before  of ninety-four for
six 
""
""
Pramila 
""
""
See 
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
And still a spin attack going on although there is a slight
breeze on the 
""
A little breeze the flag swinging the flag are waving and you can
see that  the pacers although not very successful they haven't been
operated for a long time 
""
""
""
And first ball  Pramila
""
""
Two runs 
""
Uh ninety-seven Franklin moves on to eight ninety-seven for six
""
""
The fortieth over in progress 
""
How many overs have all today could you let me know  number of
overs the pacers bowl today 
""
So  uh
""
""
One three O 
""
""
Five overs  five overs each
""
""
Five 
""
""
So ten overs have been bowled by the pacers
""
See 
""
And the leg stump 
""
The stroke coming in directly to the wicket  hand
""
""
And the Australian 
""
Only one run being taken ninety-eight for six 
""
Wonderful throw from the boundary line 
""
For Franklin and Jose 
achievements of Franklin  an upcoming player from the
Australian  for
the first of the match 
""
Here is Pramila  and on
the off stump first into the covers 
""
A little misfielding 
""
Single there 
""
Quicking towards that  but number
of overs  total ninety-nine for
six 
""
""
Appeal  Jose out
""
""
And 
""
The response is positive by the umpire 
""
You see the batsman returning 
""
And Abhay  ?
""
Jose goes back for  individual total of seventeen
 know what type of
bowling is there 
off spinner 
""
She is very 
bowler in the nineteen ninety-three World Cup 
very good throw with wonderful fielding 
""
She is a very good fielder also 
""
And she is coming up from the 
""
She gave her to guess that sneak off Jose  and Anju Jain was
right there behind the stump 
""
Anju  behind
Franklin 
""
And  turning the
body a little bit 
""
Three runs 
""
They wouldn't go for the fourth 
""
A very fast running between the wickets 
""
Before Aarti Vaidya return to ball  three runs added
""
Hundred completed for Australia 
""
Hundred and two  of
course time is not required in the over match 
""
And now we can get a little flavour of the one day 
being played here 
""
Very good delivery  Diana
Eduljee 
""
""
For a minute difficult to suspend 
""
""
Very articulate  and
there she is 
""
Two fielders outside that white 
""
Faster one 
""
Not bowling to the field
""
At the moment the faster one 
ca  but
""
""
And batsman number eight  twelve runs to the credit and
the 
""
By the spinners  and of course the spinners have been doing
remarkably well in this match 
""
Franklin taking T S Pramila 
""
Pramila is the captain of the  which won the
Rani Jhansi Trophy the Air India team 
""
Another mis- fielding 
""
Little bit of mis-fielding there at mid wicket and before the ball
is retrieved by Lea Francis  one run added hundred and three for seven
""
""
Franklin 
""
Valuable thirteen valuable runs at this stage 
""
Although the rate of scoring is low 
""
Australia now moving up 
""
The weather brightening up a little 
and just when 
improving 
""
T S Pramila bowling Franklin 
""
""
Quick 
""
""
Bright facing T S Pramila 
""
""
Bright 
""
And Bright  uncomfortably losing her
balance  maintain her
balance to go for any type of stroke 
""
""
See here  right arm going over
 so
as it has to turn a little 
""
""
But not a good choice to get her fetch her any run 
""
The score remains at hundred and three for seven 
""
The forty second over being bowled 
""
Slightly delivery on the off stump but a vast covers head 
""
""
Two runs easily 
""
The cover being too close  behind fast enough to
get  underneath the ball two runs added to the total hundred and five for
seven 
""
The forty first to  at the moment the score
is hundred and five for seven 
""
Diana Eduljee 
operating from the 
""
On the leg stump 
""
A lovely bit of fielding indeed 
""
And I think  the Indian squad now with a little bit of strike
from the Australian side  has awakened up to good fielding
""
And Ria Sen 
""
A little subdued moving that has gone 
""
Short pitch 
""
Fielded 
""
Left arm going round 
""
Not a good contact and finally Shastri there at mid wicket  at
the 
""
The bat and the ball not in a perfect condition of contact 
""
Uh delivery on the leg side open up too early  the batsman open
up too early  uh and uh another uncomfortable defensive half defensive
stroke  neither did she come for a forward
defence 
""
Hundred and five for seven 
""
Bright two 
""
Attempted cut 
""
Two  and
returned to the wicket keeper 
""
Two uh added to the total of Australian total of hundred and five
""
Now hundred and seven for seven 
""
Hundred and seven for seven three wickets remaining  two overs
remaining 
""
This forty 
""
T S Pramila from the  bowling to Bright
""
""
Faster delivery 
""
Anju unable to read that delivery of Pramila  came off herself
""
""
Lucky not to get it touched it with Bright 
""
Variations in  delivery the last one came in
""
The last of her delivery bringing in the nineth over with two
maiden  captured one wicket
so far 
""
At delivery  Diana applies
whenever she bowls to cricketers bowl to 
""
She is always leading the batsman  she saw batsman ready for
setting out and uh 
with that classic delivery of hers in the last over 
""
So Franklin returned  pavillion at the score of
hundred and seven 
""
And here is the last wicket 
""
So  at the crease now to face
Diana 
""
Five balls remaining 
""
""
""
""
cricket match 
""
""
Welcome to the Nehru Stadium  where the second one day
international between India and Australia is 
""
We are 
""
And Rose Collin 
""
This is the first ball in the third over a beautiful  ball it
is 
""
And I must tell you  my co commentator today is a great
cricketer Chandu Sarvate 
commentary in Hindi in the second one day international match 
""
The first ball from  where India took three
runs
""
And after that in the second over was a maiden over
""
And this is the third over the second ball of the third over 
""
It is  Anju Jain who is facing Rose Collins
""
No runs to be taken 
""
And  have already
proved their ability in the fielding  in fielding as well as they have
done a good bit of bowling in the end 
""
And this Rose Collin  will be operating the opening
bowler 
""
She is operating from the club house end 
""
The morning is bright and sunny and just lovely for cricket 
""
So this is going to be a fifty over match each side 
""
Three overs  five runs
""
""
And uh  batsman now facing Rose Collins is
Aarti Vaidya the left handed batsman 
""
And this 
with this weather  disturb the batsman
from the very first over 
""
A six footer 
and quite a good height for a pace baller 
""
I must  Rose Collins who got a
very good average in the first 
""
Six overs two maiden she has given only sixteen runs 
""
The runs given away matters in the one day international 
""
The bowler from the other end is now Joe Grace 
""
In the first one day international it was Anjelo 
from the  other end
""
But now it is  Joe Grace who is bowling from the hospital end
""
""
Five for no loss
""
India five for no loss 
""
Facing is Aarti Vaidya  is
""
""
Joe  when she
came in to bowl  her average was seven overs four
maiden eight runs and two wickets 
""
And that effort of hers  has brought her into the opening
bowling stand 
""
And that was a marvellous ball  going away that too from the
left handed batsman that is coming into a right handed batsman 
""
And Joe Grace a left hand middle order batsman the vice captain of
the team 
weather today 
""
The bright sunshine has got a little bit of air we can see the
swerves in the flag 
""
Joe Grace coming in once more 
""
""
Aarti Vaidya 
""
""
And  Olivia who returned the ball
""
And before that 
Indian total
""
Three more runs added 
""
And of course  uh
is a good wicket 
""
""
""
""
""
Joe Grace from the hospital end 
""
And she has been able to  really beat the batsman once more
""
""
Aarti Vaidya playing early the ball coming in a little late 
""
And being wrapped up in the pad 
""
And Aarti the left handed batsman the opening batsman of the
Indian team  score has been quite successful scoring twenty-nine runs in
the first one day international 
""
So that 
""
And in this over 
""
Quite commendable bowling and of course always disturbing the
batsman 
""
She has been able to extract  the ball
keeping a little low of course  and that is one reason why the batsman
possibly are not being able to go for runs in this early  part of the
innings 
""
Rose Collins to resume
""
One 
""
""
""
This is Rose Collins getting ready just seen beside the captain
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So that was before Julian Langle returned it 
""
Runs added to the Indian total and total moves on to  eight
for no loss 
""
Eight for no loss 
""
Rose Collins 
""
The ball again came in to the left handed batsman
""
And we 
""
Going out through a right handed batsman at 
""
This is a left hander Aarti Vaidya 
moving away from her 
""
And the first odd  on the wrapped up on the leg
""
""
Turned early 
""
And Aarti Vaidya  a little outside the
wicket 
""
And there she 
""
But she has to really be careful
""
She has not been meeting the ball quite well this morning 
""
And right on the stump once more but very careful this time is
Aarti Vaidya 
""
Taking her legs no  and
she is playing with that one slip you can just see in fact there are no other
closer seen but of course there is a double gully
