 In Hindi 
Another Arjun award winner this Sandhya Agarwal 
And of course we have the cricketing manager of the Indian side 
uh the third Arjun award winner Santarangaswamy managing this team 
Diana Eduljee 
Quite a delivery indeed but the batsman there on the crease
 unable to study the ball unable to read the ball are not
taking chances of leaving the crease 
Diana 
Left arm round on the leg stump 
No attempt for a shot 
And thirty nineth over completed with Diana completing her sixth
over two maiden ten runs and one wicket 
In just misfield you see Franklin and Jose now discussing as to the
strategy what should be adopted at this stage of the game
The fortieth over will be in progress
The run rate here as given by our scorer immediately and
 it's two point four one 
Two point four one
A very low rate of scoring 
Not a recitable total to bowl at
And Australia will have to do something about it right now 
before it's too late to recover from the say of ninety-four for
six 
Pramila 
See it's Pramila from the Darya Ganj end Amar 
Yeah 
And still a spin attack going on although there is a slight
breeze on the uh ground today 
A little breeze the flag swinging the flag are waving and you can
see that the pacers although not very successful they haven't been
operated for a long time 
 It's the spinners who are taking the field today 
And first ball fro from Pramila
 going away from the point 
Two runs three runs 
Uh ninety-seven Franklin moves on to eight ninety-seven for six
The fortieth over in progress 
How many overs have all today could you let me know number of
overs the pacers bowl today 
So it's uh
One three O five 
Five overs five overs each
Five each ten 
So ten overs have been bowled by the pacers
See it's Pramila the right arm spinner 
And the leg stump ball punished but Diana right there 
The stroke coming in directly to the wicket keeper's hand
And the Australian run restricted to only two 
Only one run being taken ninety-eight for six 
Wonderful throw from the boundary line 
For Franklin and Jose we have told you about the 
achievements of Franklin young player an upcoming player from the
Australian squad who ha who are visiting India for
the first of the match in the series 
Here is Pramila right arm elbow moved up and on
the off stump first into the covers 
A little misfielding 
Single there ninety-nine 
Quicking towards that wretched mark of hundred but number
of overs bowled a little too many for this total ninety-nine for
six 
Appeal Jose out
And the appeal there 
The response is positive by the umpire 
You see the batsman returning 
And Abhay what do you think of this ball ?
Jose goes back for total of individual total of seventeen
 this this session always necessary to know what type of
bowling is there and she has come on last evening say she is a 
off spinner 
She is very success successful 
bowler in the nineteen ninety-three World Cup where she had a 
very good throw with wonderful fielding 
She is a very good fielder also 
And she is coming up from the Darya Ganj end 
She gave her to guess that sneak off Jose and Anju Jain was
right there behind the stump collecting it 
Anju you can see her there now reaching which is behind
Franklin 
And that's a wonderful shot off the toes turning the
body a little bit and uh between the mid wicket and mid on 
Three runs 
They wouldn't go for the fourth 
A very fast running between the wickets 
Before Aarti Vaidya return to ball three runs added
Hundred completed for Australia 
Hundred and two in forty point two overs and time taken of
course time is not required in the over match 
And now we can get a little flavour of the one day match 
being played here between India and Australia 
Very good delivery bringing in the ball a little Diana
Eduljee 
For a minute difficult to suspend 
Very articulate vital spot read the batting and
there she is frightened one this time 
Two fielders outside that white line 
Faster one 
Not bowling to the field
At the moment the faster one wanted to see how the batman 
ca respond to such delivery the long off and long on kept but
 the last delivery was flatter and faster 
And batsman number eight has twelve runs to the credit and
the 
By the spinners and of course the spinners have been doing
remarkably well in this match 
Franklin taking T S Pramila 
Pramila is the captain of the champion side which won the
Rani Jhansi Trophy the Air India team and this is T S Pramila 
Another mis- fielding 
Little bit of mis-fielding there at mid wicket and before the ball
is retrieved by Lea Francis one run added hundred and three for seven
Franklin thirteen 
Valuable thirteen valuable runs at this stage 
Although the rate of scoring is low 
Australia now moving up on to the target for better total 
The weather brightening up a little the sun streaking in 
and just when the lunch break is coming the weather 
improving 
T S Pramila bowling Franklin 
Quick 
Bright facing T S Pramila 
Bright she is giving all the strike to Franklin 
And Bright played this ball uncomfortably losing her
balance going on the off side and not being able to maintain her
balance to go for any type of stroke 
See here Pramila elbow high right arm going over
 and this one bringing this one ball from the off stump so
as it has to turn a little before she could try this ball 
But not a good choice to get her fetch her any run 
The score remains at hundred and three for seven 
The forty second over being bowled 
Slightly delivery on the off stump but a vast covers head 
Two runs easily 
The cover being too close not moving behind fast enough to
get underneath the ball two runs added to the total hundred and five for
seven 
The forty first to point two overs at the moment the score
is hundred and five for seven 
Diana Eduljee that mesmerising left arm spinner of India 
operating from the club house end 
On the leg stump 
A lovely bit of fielding indeed 
And I think the Indian squad now with a little bit of strike
from the Australian side has awakened up to good fielding
And Ria Sen good cricket after a long time 
A little subdued moving that has gone brightening up now 
Short pitch right there in the middle 
Fielded no run as Aarti Bajaj mid off 
Left arm going round 
Not a good contact and finally Shastri there at mid wicket at
the square leg 
The bat and the ball not in a perfect condition of contact 
Uh delivery on the leg side open up too early the batsman open
up too early uh and uh another uncomfortable defensive half defensive
stroke didn't go for a hit neither did she come for a forward
defence 
Hundred and five for seven 
Bright two Franklin 
Attempted cut and of course successful with it 
Two before the ball is retrieved by Aarti Vaidya and
returned to the wicket keeper 
Two uh added to the total of Australian total of hundred and five
Now hundred and seven for seven 
Hundred and seven for seven three wickets remaining two overs
remaining 
This forty fourth over being bowled 
T S Pramila from the Darya Ganj end bowling to Bright
Faster delivery and came in straight to the keepers hand 
Anju unable to read that delivery of Pramila came off herself
Lucky not to get it touched it with Bright 
Variations in Pramila's delivery the last one came in
The last of her delivery bringing in the nineth over with two
maiden sixteen runs being given away she's captured one wicket
so far 
At delivery and that is the intelligence Diana applies
whenever she bowls to cricketers bowl to the opposite side 
She is always leading the batsman she saw batsman ready for
setting out and uh coming close to the ball and uh here she is 
with that classic delivery of hers in the last over 
So Franklin returned to the pavillion at the score of
hundred and seven 
And here is the last wicket 
So it's Collin Rose Collin at the crease now to face
Diana 
Five balls remaining 
 Two words one day international women's 
cricket match which is being played between India and Australia 
Welcome to the Nehru Stadium where the second one day
international between India and Australia is taking place 
We are with you when the third over is taking place 
And Rose Collin just about to bowl the third over 
This is the first ball in the third over a beautiful ball it
is 
And I must tell you my co commentator today is a great
cricketer Chandu Sarvate who is going to give you the 
commentary in Hindi in the second one day international match 
The first ball from the Australians where India took three
runs
And after that in the second over was a maiden over
And this is the third over the second ball of the third over 
It is Anju Jain who is facing Rose Collins
No runs to be taken 
And it's a the Australians w have already
proved their ability in the fielding in fielding as well as they have
done a good bit of bowling in the end 
And this Rose Collin who will be operating the opening
bowler 
She is operating from the club house end 
The morning is bright and sunny and just lovely for cricket 
So this is going to be a fifty over match each side 
Three overs there is third over being bowled five runs
And uh the Indian batsman now facing Rose Collins is
Aarti Vaidya the left handed batsman 
And this girl Rose Collins has been swirving the ball 
with this weather and have been able to really disturb the batsman
from the very first over 
A six footer she said her mother is six feet four inches 
and quite a good height for a pace baller 
I must tell you about this girl Rose Collins who got a
very good average in the first one day international 
Six overs two maiden she has given only sixteen runs 
The runs given away matters in the one day international 
The bowler from the other end is now Joe Grace 
In the first one day international it was Anjelo O'Neil 
from the other end
But now it is Joe Grace who is bowling from the hospital end
Five for no loss
India five for no loss 
Facing is Aarti Vaidya and the bowler at the other end is
 Joe Grace 
Joe Grace's average in the Delhi one day when she
came in to bowl after five bowlers her average was seven overs four
maiden eight runs and two wickets 
And that effort of hers has brought her into the opening
bowling stand and she is bowling from the hospital end now 
And that was a marvellous ball going away that too from the
left handed batsman that is coming into a right handed batsman 
And Joe Grace a left hand middle order batsman the vice captain of
the team the right arm fast medium bowler has been utilising the 
weather today 
The bright sunshine has got a little bit of air we can see the
swerves in the flag and the flags waving 
Joe Grace coming in once more 
Aarti Vaidya 
And that's Olivia who returned the ball
And before that we already have runs added to the 
Indian total
Three more runs added and valuable three runs 
And of course this wicket as Mister Salvador told you uh
is a good wicket 
 Bahut acchi 
Joe Grace from the hospital end 
And she has been able to really beat the batsman once more
Aarti Vaidya playing early the ball coming in a little late 
And being wrapped up in the pad 
And Aarti the left handed batsman the opening batsman of the
Indian team score has been quite successful scoring twenty-nine runs in
the first one day international is now facing Joe Grace 
So that was the over of Joe Grace 
And in this over she gave away only two runs 
Quite commendable bowling and of course always disturbing the
batsman 
She has been able to extract and get swing the ball
keeping a little low of course and that is one reason why the batsman
possibly are not being able to go for runs in this early part of the
innings 
Rose Collins to resume
One slip 
 We'll show you the field placing 
This is Rose Collins getting ready just seen beside the captain
 That's how her runner is a right arm bowler 
 In Hindi 
So that was before Julian Langle returned it 
Runs added to the Indian total and total moves on to eight
for no loss 
Eight for no loss 
Rose Collins about to bowl 
The ball again came in to the left handed batsman
And we see the ball swirving out 
Going out through a right handed batsman at one slip 
This is a left hander Aarti Vaidya though the ball is 
moving away from her 
And the first odd right in on the wrapped up on the leg
 and there is an appeal from Rose Collins 
Turned early the ball came in late 
And Aarti Vaidya caught there a little outside the
wicket according to the judgement of the umpire 
And there she is just about to resume 
But she has to really be careful
She has not been meeting the ball quite well this morning 
And right on the stump once more but very careful this time is
Aarti Vaidya 
Taking her legs no gap between the bat and the pad and
she is playing with that one slip you can just see in fact there are no other
closer seen but of course there is a double gully wide apart
