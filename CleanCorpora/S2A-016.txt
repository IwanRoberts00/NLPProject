And this is the third over the second ball of the third over 
""
""

No runs to be taken 
""
And  have already
""
done a good bit of bowling in the end 
""
And this Rose Collin  will be operating the opening
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this is going to be a fifty over match each side 
""
Three overs  five runs
""
""
""
Aarti Vaidya the left handed batsman 
""
And this 
""
""
""
A six footer

And Aarti the left handed batsman the opening batsman of the
Indian team  score has been quite successful scoring twenty-nine runs in

So that

""
""
