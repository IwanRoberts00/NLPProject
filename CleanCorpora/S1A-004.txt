<I>
""
""
Uhm hello Ashokji  I'm
""
""
 a
distant place Orissa 
""
 uh the time which usually can't be
recalled 
""
I had been to Pandarpur  and uh what
I saw there  is uh a temple of uh Vithalji you know usually the people of
Maharashtra they call 
""
""
""
""
""
And one thing  surprised to find Vithalji standing
alone 
""
That that reminds me of the beech  they call it uh
surely a brick uh uhm is thrown by the disciple maybe the maybe the person
who was this Vithal previously and they ordered Vithal to stand on the brick
""
""
""
""
""
That is Pundalik  his devotee
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes uh 
""
I  know much about the legend
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But what  uh is so surprising there in the temple is that I
found Rukmani standing alone 
""
Vithalji has never given any sort of uh importance to  a woman
called Rukmani 
""
""
No  not the case
""
What happened you know Pundalik  that's
 or Panduranga
""
""
Panduranga once visited  house
you know 
 yeah yeah
""
Panduranga wanted 
but Pundalika being a very obedient son  and very again
we can say devoted to his  he had no time
 so he threw a
piece of brick you know and made him stand or made him wait there until he
finishes  service to his parents
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
didn't  did not accompany Panduranga
 and so Panduranga the Vithal is shown to be alone over there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is standing on the brick but in other parts of the temple
you will find Rukmani along with  yes
yes 
""
But for this particular event  particular
episode you know Vithala is alone over there 
 house
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But there I found you know  the feminine
power is hot there when  I
found uh  Vithal is selfish enough not to allow Rukmani proper position
""
""
I found desciples making long line  to visit
Vithal whereas nobody was here before the temple of Rukmani 
""
So it shocked me really
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No
""
""
The same thing you know the same thing had happened in Orissa
also 
""
""
Shrikhetra 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
$A>
""
And  Jagannath which is brought there
Balabhadra comes out in the cart festival  we found that
uh  uhm their sister
Subhadra  uhm
stays alone inside the temple 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So really I found gods in general  they become selfish when
 must be given
to the gods 
""
But 
""
Samleshwari  and where usually we find godesses are
worshipped 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah now 
 if it happens to be a temple of Panduranga mainly
 very natural that focus is on
Panduranga when  you
find Mahalaxmi only there  not her husband that is in Tirupati
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Tirupati is supposed to be  you know
""
 that is Tirupati shrine in the temple
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
So it is not a kind of injustice or just subordinating the
role of a woman or so 
""
These gods and goddesses you know  so once it is
a temple of Mahalaxmi Mahalaxmi has to be in focus
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
When it is temple of Panduranga or the Vithala Vithala has to
be in focus
""
""
Okay it depends upon  name
""
""
""
""
""
Jagannath temple  they are no Laxmi
""
""
""
""
""
And in those days you know there was nothing like feminism
""
""
Yeah  right so
""
""
If I bring in that kind of interpretation  over here
""
""
""
 right
""
""
you've 
Maharashtra is very good people are nice soft spoken well behaved and uh 
exactly like the Oriya people 
""
The dishes are also  yeah
 the
culture differs a little bit I think
""
""
""
""
""
Oh it has to differ you know 
""
But as you say that is uh 
 different
from the staple food  in Maharashtra
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
Because in Maharashtra 
chapati  or
""
""
 then
""
""
 we say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
 jowari
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we 
""
""
We know 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Actually I found much difficulty in swallowing  jowari
 what you
call 
""
""
""
""
""
 not a very
crisp and uh 
delicate 
but when it is hot and fresh you know  really
relish it  relish
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But  a common
food all over India even all over the world you know  common
""
""
You get wheat 
""
""
""
""
""
 lekin
chapati na  that much of energy to
human body 
""
And uh so far the department is concerned I found all the
professors and teachers 
you know serious about the teaching 
""
""
Yes 
""
""
 the
student of this department you know much better than  cough
""
""
But within this few 
uh  in the hostel ladies hostel
""
""
""
""
""
I found  uhm an an
enthusiastic boss to encourage hostel life anything
""
""
No basically all of them are first  they all of them are
 and
you know that 
""
 because
you never
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Naturally I was
""
""
Because  hardly you know any outsider finds it difficult
here 
""
Because as far as possible because  our
limitations  because office looks after
 you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So whatever office provides or offers 
the same thing we extend to the participants also 
""
But we see that 
 always there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or not only the professors or  lecturers who are working
here  along with
the peons you know  uh Mr
Bhonsle  all of them are quite cordial
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And uhm  heard much about Dr
Shastri from you since you were a very student of Dr Shastri 
uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh  uh
""
""
Because I  I just mentioned
once yesterday only 
""
Because when after the session was over 
yesterday I went to his place
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes I would like to see him  your wife also
specially because  laughs
""
""
""
""
""
""
Why she  she has chosen the life of a housewife
""
""
""
Oh I see
""
""
Because since I gave a paper on feminine power 
yeah  uh that I will I must reinvigorate her mind
""
""
""
""
""
But she does exert her power at home 
feminine power I mean that she 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not a single man a husband  all of us
""
""
""
""
""
""
 I give you one example here
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Just one and a half months ago  I had my
aunty with us  my aunty who is above seventy-five
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  a Maharashtrian no
""
""
Yeah 
""
she 
""
She did just fell down in  one word
""
and then I got the message  uh condition
is very serious or she is very serious
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then I  uhm
""
""
Thereafter next day I took my 
uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She was there in the hospital for eight 
""
""
Nine days
""
""
Thereafter she was discharged  she was given discharge
""
""
Uh how is she now
""
""
She is now  is alright
""
Now I 
""
She stayed with us
""
""
""
""
""
Ah in your house
""
""
Yes in my house she stayed with us for five 
""
""
So we two together  me and my wife
""
""
""
""
""
Now  taking care of her now
""
""
Not only to care you no  it
was impossible for her to walk  but
since
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So she is very much engaged your wife is  yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If she were working 
""
""
 so much of attention you would not
have taken
""
""
Yeah now she  my aunty would not have been able to walk
again 
""
She would not have been able to 
""
""
""
""
""
 but uh
""
""
So it is not a question of working outside  uhm
""
""
 you
say though  serving the old people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes  think
""
""
So  where you know
""
""
Yes
""
""
So what you gain by serving outside maybe  you get returns
in terms of  moneys you know
""
""
But this kind of achievement  is not possible
outside
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm some satisfaction 
""
""
No if somebody works outside  somebody
needs to be there  to look after the house
""
Maybe husband maybe children maybe 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Someone must be there
""
""
So your opinion  but
when 
""
""
""
""
""
But 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if you have somebody at home  to
""
then you know 
 that one should go out and work you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if there is nobody to look after in the house you know
""
""
You should give the priorities  and you
should
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes in fixing of 
""
""
 and you should think that
at what expense  you would work outside
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm but we modern women women are very much confused 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 at what expense
""
""
""
If you think that well she is  I'll
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh 
""
Let me do my  duties you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ah
""
""
So  not humane
""
""
 you know
""
""
You will get it returned
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  right
""
""
In this hour something in your this in this life also you
suffer
""
""
So it is the priority 
""
What you value more
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 money
""
""
But that  doing the work of
 humanism
""
""
""
""
Even the money is necessary 
instrumental and secondary 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
 what I think
""
""
""
These two children if my wife goes out and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 they would be neglected
""
""
They would be neglected
""
So what is the use of your earning
""
""
Uh 
""
One thing is  you can engage your
wife 
""
""
""
 she has done M A in English
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
She has 
""
""
 she has done
 M A in English
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah she has done her B Ed  and that too after we got
married
