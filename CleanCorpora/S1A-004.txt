<I>
Uhm hello Ashokji I'm nice here because I'm
 having nice time in your department 
 It's really a pleasure to me that I came from a
distant place Orissa 
 I'm really having uh the time which usually can't be
recalled so easily uh when I go back to Orissa 
I had been to Pandarpur cough last Sunday and uh what
I saw there is uh a temple of uh Vithalji you know usually the people of
Maharashtra they call that uhm Vithal Vithal and Rukmani 
 Vithal Pandurang 
And one thing I'm surprised to find Vithalji standing
alone in such a way on a piece of uh brick yeah 
That that reminds me of the beech you know they call it uh
surely a brick uh uhm is thrown by the disciple maybe the maybe the person
who was this Vithal previously and they ordered Vithal to stand on the brick
 Yeah 
That is Pundalik Pundalik his devotee
 Pundalik 
Yes yes uh exactly 
I don't know much about the legend
Yeah 
But what uh is so surprising there in the temple is that I
found Rukmani standing alone 
Vithalji has never given any sort of uh importance to a woman
called Rukmani 
No that's not the case
What happened you know Pundalik yeah that's
 bhakta of Vithala uhm or Panduranga
 uhm uhm 
Panduranga once visited Pundali Pundalika's house
you know yes and Pundalika was so engrossed and busy 
 ah ha serving his parents you know yeah yeah
 and Panduranga as he went there you know uhm 
Panduranga wanted Pundalika to pay attention to him ah 
but Pundalika being a very obedient son uhm and very again
we can say devoted to his uh parents you know he had no time
 to pay attention to Vithal Vithal so he threw a
piece of brick you know and made him stand or made him wait there until he
finishes his service service to his parents
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
 Yes 
 Uhm 
 Yeah yeah 
 Uhm 
 Ah 
 Uhm 
 Parents 
 Vithal yeah 
 The work 
So that's why that time Rukmani 
didn't accompany Pundalika did not accompany Panduranga
 and so Panduranga the Vithal is shown to be alone over there
 So faithful it seems 
 Vithalji Vithal yes 
That is standing on the brick but in other parts of the temple
you will find Rukmani along with yeah Vithal yes
yes 
But for this particular event ah particular
episode you know Vithala is alone over there because he alone visited 
 Pundalika's house
 Yeah 
 yes yes 
 Ah 
But there I found you know uhm the feminine
power is hot there when I'm being a female yeah I
found uh Vithal is selfish enough not to allow Rukmani proper position
 yeah 
I found desciples making long line yeah to visit
Vithal whereas nobody was here before the temple of Rukmani 
So it shocked me really
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
No
The same thing you know the same thing had happened in Orissa
also yeah 
 We've the Jagannath temple in Puri 
Shrikhetra yeah which usually call it 
 Yeah 
 Yeah Puri 
 Yeah 
$A>
And uh whenever Jagannath which is brought there
Balabhadra comes out in the cart festival ah we found that
uh both of them both the brothers they accompany uhm their sister
Subhadra uhm and on the other hand we find Laxmi uhm
stays alone inside the temple 
 Ah 
 Uhm 
So really I found gods in general they become selfish when
 uh they find uh the importance of the disciples must be given
to the gods 
But we've also temples called Mahalaxmi temple 
 yeah in our Sambalpuri yeah we've 
Samleshwari mandir and where usually we find godesses are
worshipped 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah now and uh what happens 
 haan if it happens to be a temple of Panduranga mainly
 yeah so it's very natural that focus is on
Panduranga when it's a temple of Mahalaxmi uhm you
find Mahalaxmi only there not her husband that is in Tirupati
 And uh 
 Haan 
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
Yeah
Tirupati is supposed to be her husband you know
 yes but nowhere you find his shrine in the temple 
 uhm that is Tirupati shrine in the temple
 Her husband 
 Yes 
 Uhm 
Uhm
So it is not a kind of injustice or just subordinating the
role of a woman or so 
These gods and goddesses you know uhm so once it is
a temple of Mahalaxmi Mahalaxmi has to be in focus
 Uhm 
Yes yes
When it is temple of Panduranga or the Vithala Vithala has to
be in focus
Okay it depends upon the name name
 It depends on 
Jagannath temple so Jagannath they are no Laxmi
 Jagannath 
And in those days you know there was nothing like feminism
Yeah laughter of course you're right so
If I bring in that kind of interpretation over here
 Laughs that's right
 You've really I'm sorry in a very good way 
you've convinced me and uh I found the climate of 
Maharashtra is very good people are nice soft spoken well behaved and uh 
exactly like the Oriya people 
The dishes are also uh quite similar to the yeah
 dishes of Orissa and the system you know the culture the
culture differs a little bit I think
 Yeah 
Oh it has to differ you know 
But as you say that is uh dishes that is food staple food 
 uhm so staple food in Oriya must be uh I mean different
from the staple food we've in Maharashtra
 Uhm 
Yeah yeah
Because in Maharashtra normally we've a 
chapati or
 Chapati then
 Bhakri we say
 Bhakri 
 Jowari 
Yes yes
 Bhakri made up of jowari
 
 Made up of jowari 
So we don't have that 
We know certainly you don't have because 
 it is 
 So I found 
Actually I found much difficulty in swallowing jowari
 that means that bhakri what you
call bhakri 
 Bhakri 
 Bhakri because it's not a very
crisp and uh yeah what you say delicate 
delicate and very soft you know but when it is fresh 
but when it is hot and fresh you know yeah you really
relish it relish
 Yeah 
 Delicate 
 But I like chapati 
 Yeah 
But chapatis you know it's a common
food all over India even all over the world you know it's common
 yeah yeah 
You get wheat everywhere 
 Yeah yeah 
 Everywhere you can get it lekin
chapati na it is sufficient to supply that much of energy to
human body 
And uh so far the department is concerned I found all the
professors and teachers sounding of bells they are quite uh 
you know serious about the teaching 
Yes sounding of bells in the university 
 Yes in your your department you're the
student of this department you know much better than myself cough
But within this few one word days of my staying in 
uh Kolhapur in the hostel ladies hostel
 Kolhapur 
I found uh that the coordinator is really uhm an an
enthusiastic boss to encourage hostel life anything
No basically all of them are first they all of them are
 human and humane uhm both very kind soft spoken and
you know that uh kind of hospitality that all of us share here 
 That's unique you might say haa because
you never
 Uhm 
 Naturally 
Naturally I was
Because hardly you know any outsider finds it difficult
here to stay atleast on the campus you know yeah 
Because as far as possible because we've our
limitations in a way uhm because office looks after
 all these things you know
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
 Haan 
So whatever office provides or offers ah 
the same thing we extend to the participants also 
But we see that not much inconvenience is done to the 
 participants so that's always there
 Ah 
 Participants 
Or not only the professors or lecturers who are working
here but uh office assistant also yeah along with
the peons you know yeah and that Mr Chavan and uh Mr
Bhonsle yeah all of them are quite cordial
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
Yeah
And uhm so far you two I've heard much about Dr
Shastri from you since you were a very student of Dr Shastri 
uhm but I haven't seen him with my eyes 
 Uhm 
 No we we can do we can do one thing 
 yeah not today uhm but tomorrow or day after 
 uhm we can go to his place 
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Oh it's uh
Because I just one mention I just mentioned
once yesterday only yeah 
Because when after the session was over yes 
yesterday I went to his place
 I'm eagerly 
 Yeah 
 Yes 
Yes I would like to see him and your wife also
specially because I'll take an interview of your wife laughs
 So 
Why she chos she has chosen the life of a housewife
Oh I see
Because since I gave a paper on feminine power 
yeah uh that I will I must reinvigorate her mind
 Yeah 
But she does exert her power at home laughter 
feminine power I mean that she does have 
 It's not sufficient you know 
 We're born to serve others yeah 
Not a single man a husband all family members all of us
 have got some responsibility for the society 
 Yeah 
 Now I believe in I give you one example here
Uhm
Just one and a half months ago uhm I had my
aunty with us uhm my aunty who is above seventy-five
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Yeah you're a Maharashtrian no
Yeah uh and who's above seventy-five 
 uhm and some six or seven months back yeah 
she uh got an attack of paralysis my god 
She did just fell down in then in a one word
 then she was rushed to the hospital near Karad uhm 
and then I got the message uhm as her uh condition
is very serious or she is very serious
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 My God 
 Then 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Then I uhm went to Karad uhm
Thereafter next day I took my all the members 
uhm of my family and we went there 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
She was there in the hospital for eight nine days 
Nine days
Thereafter she was discharged she was given discharge
Uh how is she now
She is now is alright
Now I uh brought her here yeah 
She stayed with us
 Yeah 
Ah in your house
Yes in my house she stayed with us for five months 
 uh ha 
So we two together me and my wife
 Uh ha 
Now you're taking care of her now
Not only to care you no uhm she was it
was impossible for her to walk to move everything but
since
 Uhm 
 To move 
So she is very much engaged your wife is yeah
 very much engaged in the house-hold activities 
 Yeah 
 Yeah she is engaged 
If she were working if my wife 
 Uhm and then so much of attention you would not
have taken
Yeah now she my aunty would not have been able to walk
again uhm 
She would not have been able to walk again 
 Uhm 
 Haan but uh
So it is not a question of working outside uhm
 It's a question of serving serve you
say though yeah serving the old people
 Uhm 
 Serve 
 Yeah 
Yes yes don't think
So that's where you know
Yes
So what you gain by serving outside maybe you get returns
in terms of say rupees or moneys you know
 
But this kind of achievement uhm is not possible
outside
 Ah ha 
 Uhm 
Uhm some satisfaction 
No if somebody works outside ah somebody
needs to be there yeah to look after the house
Maybe husband maybe children maybe that is there 
 Ah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah some someone 
Someone must be there
So your opinion I I do respect uhm but
when 
 Uhm 
But I'm not talking in terms of money you know 
 I'm not talking in terms of money 
 Not not money 
But if you have somebody at home yes to
 look after the you know house hold affairs you know 
then you know it's very uh it's quite right 
 uhm that one should go out and work you know
 Yes 
 Ah yes sure sure 
 Uhm 
But if there is nobody to look after in the house you know
 uhm why 
You should give the priorities uhm and you
should
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Yes in fixing of one's priority 
 In fixing of priority and you should think that
at what expense yeah you would work outside
 Yeah 
Uhm uhm but we modern women women are very much confused 
 yeah so far fixing the priorities are concerned 
 Yeah 
 But at what expense
 That's what I say you know 
If you think that well she is uh ill I'll
 she can't walk 
 I'll 
 She is old and say 
 Let her let her occupy one corner 
uh 
Let me do my other duties you know
 Uh 
 Sure 
Ah
So that's not humane
 You're doing a very pious duty you know
 don't think that it will be wasted yeah 
You will get it returned
 That's not human 
 Yeah 
Yeah that's right
In this hour something in your this in this life also you
suffer
So it is the priority yeah 
What you value more
 Yeah 
Yeah human love affection 
 Affection money
But that one word is also doing the work of
 humanism
 Money money 
Even the money is necessary uhm uhm it is 
instrumental and secondary 
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm
 That's what I think
 I've two children 
These two children if my wife goes out and say teaches 
 uhm other children or if 
 Uhm 
 Other children they would be neglected
They would be neglected
So what is the use of your earning
Uh na 
One thing is I can advise Ashokji that you can engage your
wife after the children become one word 
 That's fine because you know 
 efficient she has done M A in English
 Efficient 
Yeah
She has done 
 It's nice she she has done
 M A in English
 She has done 
Yeah she has done her B Ed and that too after we got
married
