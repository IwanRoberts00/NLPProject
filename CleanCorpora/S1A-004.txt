Uhm hello Ashokji  I'm
""
""
 a
""
""
""
""
""
""
I saw there  is uh a temple of uh Vithalji you know usually the people of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No  not the case
""
What happened you know Pundalik  that's
""
""
""
""
""
 yeah yeah
""
Panduranga wanted 
but Pundalika being a very obedient son  and very again
""
 so he threw a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
didn't  did not accompany Panduranga
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Vithal whereas nobody was here before the temple of Rukmani 
""
So it shocked me really
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The same thing you know the same thing had happened in Orissa
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
stays alone inside the temple 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 must be given
""
""
""
""
""
worshipped 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Panduranga when  you
find Mahalaxmi only there  not her husband that is in Tirupati
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that is Tirupati shrine in the temple
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
a temple of Mahalaxmi Mahalaxmi has to be in focus
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
""
be in focus
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If I bring in that kind of interpretation  over here
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
culture differs a little bit I think
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But as you say that is uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because in Maharashtra 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes

""
crisp and uh 
""
""
relish it  relish
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
You get wheat 
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
No basically all of them are first  they all of them are
""
you know that 
""
""
you never
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
limitations  because office looks after
""
""
