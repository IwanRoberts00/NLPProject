Hello  there are atleast
""
""
One is distribution 
""
Depending on the school of thinking your tools of analysis also
""
""
For example  then your
""
between workers and entrepreneurs 
""
""
tools of analysis are calculus 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
People don't read these days that book 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Marshall was a man of tremendous perception 
""
""
like that because women are considered to be more perceptive than men 
""
""
Uh so 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
For example if I have a curve like this  I can't take a tangent
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Whatever I give up in pie 
""
Whereas here there is an assumption that there is diminishing
""
""
""
""
Take away this assumption 
""
""
to in text books let me 
""
""
you know it is an assumption  independent
""
""
For example  take the most important micro foundation that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I tell the students  utility is a
""
""
Right  ?
""
""
satisfied 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Right  ?
""
""
indifference curve or a utility function 
""
First we say  Utility is a function of Q one and Q two
""
""
And in the next page or the next paragraph the text book draws a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 it is near impossible to get that equation
""
""
""
""
""
Something on the foundation  because what happens is you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
reading this book and teaching to our students 
""
But before that we try to translate it because we want to have it
""
""
And in second  you know it is happening like that as if
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But  it is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I will not go  drag you into that controversy which is a very
""
""
Let me come back to this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They don't say  They
""
""
""
""
 uh people are rational
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That kind of a capability must be there then only I can  okay
""
""
It assumes like that  and it it has certain a sect of axioms
""
""
""
""
""
point to this graph  and then
draw this curve 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then that is the  Beta amount of satisfaction I get by
""
""
If this total is hundred  then if this fifty that must be fifty
""
""
""
""
If this is forty-five that must be  know like the it it can't
""
""
And if you retain that  don't have that hundred you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But if you don't have a curvature I can't have a tangent 
""
If I don't have a tangent 
""
""
""
""
""
substitution 
""
It is a contradictory assumption to the givens 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If you take any journal any magazine and start let U be a function
""
""
We make an assumption 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Has anybody followed this ?
""
You can ask me questions about all these things 
""
""
""
""
in books 
""
""
economics 
""
Because if you can't draw this you can't draw an isoquant 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
been a straight line 
""
Because what is happening is  the Y axis
""
""
And this length is fixed 
""
And what we have here is a projection of this third axis 
because it  drawn in a flat way
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So here is a third axis 
""
 and as long as this is fixed and
""
other than a straight line 
""
""
""
Therefore and it is fixed  and it will be a line like this and
""
""
""
""
""
""
The classical school of thinker don't believe in the marginal
""
""
""
""
economist  the production activity takes place with using those
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
offer 
""
And that return is  as much as what they contribute to output
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 theorem comes into
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because you can't have your micro economics without this kind of a
""
""
One another question 
""
""
""
not any one of them 
""
Otherwise it would have beeen somewhere in the intercepting 
""
The indifference curve always start from head here  not here
""
""
""
that may not be so in actual life  except when women are buying their
""
""
""
moreover a 
 they are compliment and not
""
""
Yeah  so actual life what happens actual life is you go to a
shop  you ask the various prices and things like that
""
You see the colour this that etcetera and so on 
""
And you know how much you have the money and 
""
""
So it will be a line like this  rather than a curve like this
""
""
So but here we have got a choice model  which is uh as if
""
""
""
""
We have created a world of choice making 
""
""
""
""
This is so in the economics of consumption  economics of
""
""
""
 if you see that
""
nothing but a systematic application of the theory of differential calculus
""
""
""
 if instead of Q one and Q two I make it K and L it becomes an isoquant
""
""
And instead of the budget constraint  this becomes a cost line
""
""
substitution 
""
The terminology is different  the context is different but the
""
""
At the foundation of economic analysis  you have dispariding of
""
""
""
