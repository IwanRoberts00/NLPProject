Hello uh recap we said that there are atleast
 two schools of thought when it comes to the scope of economics 
One is distribution one emphasises allocation 
Depending on the school of thinking your tools of analysis also
differs 
For example when you have distribution as your aim then your
thinking apparatus will be in this way where surplus is distributed
between workers and entrepreneurs 
Whereas when you have allocation as allocation as your aim then your
tools of analysis are calculus 
One another distinction 
When it comes to the question of allocation substitution
between the two things becomes the central issue 
Alfred Marshall in his principles of economics if you see
 the eighth edition which was the last one that is there if he had
lived upto now he would have made further editions of the same thing 
It is a very nice book
People don't read these days that book 
It is very good 
For the sheer English language atleast it is worth reading 
Apart from very perceptive ideas 
Marshall was a man of tremendous perception 
Joan Robinson once said that he has a woman's perception
like that because women are considered to be more perceptive than men 
laughs 
Uh so that that that's the way she described him 
Well if you see in the preface Alfred Marshall says 
that the chief merit of this book is the application of the principle of
substitution in every branch of economics because if you don't have that
substitution you can't have the maximisation thing 
It is an essential part of it 
For example if I have a curve like this I can't take a tangent
It requires that I have a a relationship which has a curvature
Here here for example it is diminishing this but it is
diminishing at a constant rate 
Whatever I give up in pie I get in W U and vice versa 
Whereas here there is an assumption that there is diminishing
marginal rate of substitution 
This is at the heart of micro economics 
Take away this assumption micro tools are not there 
But at this point one another thing which is normally not refer
to in text books let me present to you 
This assumption of diminishing marginal rate of substitution 
you know it is an assumption independent of mathematics independent
of mathematics 
For example take the most important micro foundation that
first chapter the students learn 
That is about utility theory utility maximisation 
And when the students come to the classroom we tell them that uh
 that if there are two commodities and if I let us say Q one 
and Q two are the two commodities 
And I tell the students you know that utility is a
function of the consumption of these two commodities 
Right ?
And I make an assumption that the more he consume the more he is
satisfied 
More is preferred than less 
And we make an assumption that preferences are transitive 
though you know that it is if A is bigger than B and B is bigger than C than
A is bigger than C and not the other way round
This kind of axioms of choice we teach them because on that
basis this is the micro foundage you know micro economic is grounded in
individual behaviour 
And those individual behaviour we give in the form of axioms of
choice 
Right ?
And on the basis of that we try to derive what is known as an
indifference curve or a utility function 
First we say Utility is a function of Q one and Q two
And in the next page or the next paragraph the text book draws a
picture like this B B writing 
They won't explain how come this equation this picture came 
That is why students find it very difficult to understand 
And you know sometimes teachers also find it difficult
And sometimes you know what happens is the students don't ask
questions luckily otherwise it will be very laughter very
embarassing for the teacher because from this to this you try your best
 it is near impossible to get that equation
I will tell you why 
That is what we have to learn in refresher programmes 
Something on the foundation because what happens is you know
for twenty years some book comes we teach to our students on the twenty-first
year they say We have changed this book because this is a wrong book
like that 
We also start saying the same thing laughter 
You know in the beginning we didn't ask the question why are we
reading this book and teaching to our students 
But before that we try to translate it because we want to have it
everything in this one
And in second bo you know it is happening like that as if
knowledge comes for from there 
It is true knowledge comes from everywhere 
But it can also start from here too 
And there can be an exchange that is possible if we look at
these things critically 
And therefore if we find that there is some problem herer 
error here I'm not suggesting throw this away 
No no far from it 
But remembering that such a kind of a thing is there it is
not something very perfect 
It is imperfect
But all knowledge is like that whether it is physics or
even mathematics or even mathematics uhm
I will not go drag you into that controversy which is a very
interesting one
Let me come back to this 
I am talking of micro theory now foundations of micro theory
And in that micro theory takes allocation as the scope of
economics
It takes calculus as the tool for analysis 
It assumes about individuals 
The major assumption it makes is people are selfish 
They don't say It like this they say They
are rational laughs 
Because if I say People are selfish it looks very
bad look he is blaming uh being sales kind of people there we write
 uh people are rational
And rational means that I can order my preferences and choose the
best 
That capability I have like that 
It presumes numeracy and order 
That kind of a capability must be there then only I can okay
It assumes like that and it it has certain a sect of axioms
about preferences and then we say that utility is a function of
consumption 
And then we say Let U bar be the level of utility 
because unless you have this U bar fixed you don't know where is the first
point to this graph so you take the first point like that and then
draw this curve 
But there is a problem because suppose U bar is equal to
hundred B B writing right ?
Then I get some utility by consum 
consuming Q one let's call it Alpha times Q one so
much Alpha amount of satisfaction I get by Q one 
And then that is the Beta amount of satisfaction I get by
consuming Q two 
If this total is hundred then if this fifty that must be fifty
If this is seventy-five that must be twenty-five 
If this is forty-five that must be know like the it it can't
be more or less and this hundred can be retained 
And if you retain that hun don't have that hundred you
can't draw the curve 
If you have that hundred then we find you can try it out any
number of times 
Then we find that it will be a line like this and not a curvature
like this 
But if you don't have a curvature I can't have a tangent 
If I don't have a tangent I don't have a maxima 
Therefore I need a tangent
And if I have to draw this tangent I need to make an assumption 
and economist at the micro level have assumed diminishing marginal rate of
substitution 
It is a contradictory assumption to the givens 
Naturally the right assumption when you say U bar is
equal to this and draw the curve it has to be this way 
But we are drawing it this way for mathematical convenience
If you take any journal any magazine and start let U be a function
of something twice differentiable
We make an assumption 
Differentiable means drawing of tangent that is finding derivitives
we say in mathematics but drawing a capa 
capacity to draw a tangent 
It is tangent is drawable such a curve is assumed 
If it was natural there was no need for an assumption 
We are making an assumption because this is there
is a contradict
Has anybody followed this ?
You can ask me questions about all these things 
Even in between the lecture also you can stop me and ask
I will explain any number of times because this is not there
in books 
Because striking this out is striking the root of neo-classical
economics 
Because if you can't draw this you can't draw an isoquant 
Same principle is true an isoquant is supposed to give iso
means equal quant means quantity 
Isoquant means equal quantity
If equal quantity is to be there then substitution should have
been a straight line 
Because what is happening is here the X axis the Y axis
 and here is the third axis this is the utility axis actually 
And this length is fixed that's why U bar 
And what we have here is a projection of this third axis 
because it it's a three dimensional picture drawn in a flat way
It it happens to all the artist when they are painting
 it's usually three dimensional but it is written on a flat
surface 
But your perception your understanding is like that
So here is a third axis not seen 
 It's projection and as long as this is fixed and
straight it this can't be ano anything 
other than a straight line 
If this is it because scale has to be straight 
Therefore and it is fixed and it will be a line like this and
marginal productivity become in fact that is why many people criticise
marginal productivity theory 
On several grounds they criti criticised
 that 
The classical school of thinker don't believe in the marginal
productivity theory as you know because for them the wage fund is given
 and then the activity of production takes place 
Whereas for the neo-classical ec 
economist the production activity takes place with using those
inputs 
And then those inputs are used again on the basis of supply and
demand thing 
And brings rational producers and consumers 
They will supply and demand in such a manner that the price they
offer ge gets them some return 
And that return is as much as what they contribute to output
 That's how the marginal productivity theory comes 
With all its difficulty it has a grain of justice 
In the sense that give him what he has contributed 
 It's quite a nice concept that is why if you give
each person what he has contributed than zero profit condition comes 
 That's how the one word theorem comes into
picture 
You see how this is micro economic foundation 
Are you understanding me ?
Because you can't have your micro economics without this kind of a
thing 
One another question 
In actual life when you make a choice the choice is never
like this because this assumes that always you buy a combination and
not any one of them 
Otherwise it would have beeen somewhere in the intercepting 
The indifference curve always start from head here not here
There is a need that I must have all the time a combination 
that may not be so in actual life except when women are buying their
 sarees and they want a matching blouse piece 
Then only a combination question comes otherwise and
moreover a saree and a blouse piece are not substitutes 
 laughs they are compliment they are compliment and not
substitutes and therefore you can't have law of substitution there
Yeah so actual life what happens actual life is you go to a
shop you ask the various prices and things like that
You see the colour this that etcetera and so on 
And you know how much you have the money and and therefore 
then you can order them and take according to you the best 
So it will be a line like this rather than a curve like this
So but here we have got a choice model which is uh as if
thing
It is a world of its own 
We have created a world of choice making 
And then we are making assumptions about substitution and on
the basis of that we are deciding the best using the tools of calculus 
This is so in the economics of consumption economics of
production of international trade any area you go 
That is why Professor Samuel San when he wrote his book 
 Foundations of Economic Analysis if you see that
book you'll find from page one to the last page it is
nothing but a systematic application of the theory of differential calculus
The same tool the same kind of graph but they are interpreted
 if instead of Q one and Q two I make it K and L it becomes an isoquant
And instead of the budget constraint this becomes a cost line
 isocostline and wherever they are tangential there it is a question
of commodity substitution here it will be a question of fact of
substitution 
The terminology is different the context is different but the
tool is the same 
At the foundation of economic analysis you have dispariding of
thinking 
That is the first point I wanted to present to you because if
you say what is at the foundation of micro economic is this behaviour is
disparidgm
