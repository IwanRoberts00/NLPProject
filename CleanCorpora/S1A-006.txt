Mr Yadav I think we should discuss about Premchand and his 
""
""
How do you think like that
""
""
""
""
""
""
Premchand the greatest of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So he should be considered as the front ranker 
""
""
Front ranker
""
""
Front ranker 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Then by the word novel we suppose a such detail type of prose story
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 considering about the quality
""
""
""
No I just  as
a novelist 
""
""
""
""
""
What kind of characters he put in his novel
""
""
""
""
I think Premchand is primarily dealing with the characters related
to the rural life of India
""
He is always depicting the rural picture of countryside and the
villages in India particularly in the 
""
""
""
characters 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because you see Premchand was a true  novelist in its sense
""
""
any artificial ornamentation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All type of taxes being levied by the aristocratic and ruling set
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 certainly
""
""
""
though I think he is an escapist 
""
He leaves the hard realities of life he runs away  and he
 reveal the reality
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
by so many 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
able to get some prize
""
In his cheerly he was fascinated for buying so many ornaments to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
over expense  uh high valued jewelleries
""
""
It did create  lot of problems for him he had leave his flee
""
""
""
""
""
society
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
pictures card I think
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
about  picturising all the minute details
""
For example the roads  full of dust
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this type of lively picturise then gives you a very healthy
""
location
""
""
""
""
""
 very
""
""
""
""
And very live  lively
""
""
""
""
""
""
uses in his novels 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or even the word  suggest a kind of our naturality
""
""
""
actually spoken by the native people  in the remote village side
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
communicative 
""
""
understand  uneducated person also can be able to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
suppose middle class or the upper middle class or the  uh or the upper
""
""
all things that are possible
""
""
""
there is a kind of  two kinds of uh language there
""
""
chief is something 
and something high sounding but the language used by the servant is something
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now I would like to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
that they have just  care
""
""
dying
""
And which Premchand has shown in this way  uh while
""
mercilesly 
""
And at the same time son and father-in-law are sleeping in deep
""
""
So there the tongue two  do indicates such
a kind of pictorial touch  use of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And you come across uh  numberless
""
""
""
Premchand in his novels and particularly in his short stories
""
For example  Panch Parmeshwar
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh swollen something like that
""
""
Yes  true
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 so many
""
""
""
""
""
different context and situations  and those expressions
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now I would like to talk about his satirical aspect 
""
I think Premchand is a great satirist  he
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  Gaban
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
 great satirist
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
stories wants to recorrect society 
""
""
""
""
""
""
by his critical comments he tried to enlighten the people and be aware 
towards all these irregularities and if possible try to remove them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
regarding all the grim realities and grim difficulties that our society face
""
""
Particularly one must remember that Premchand was writing  uh
""
pre-Independence era when India was not free and it was under the clutches of
British monarchy
""
All type of oppression  in the name
of British Queen after a  proclamation of eighteen fifty-eight
""
""
to see  our society is
""
""
""
""
