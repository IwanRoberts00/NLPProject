Mr Yadav I think we should discuss about Premchand and his 
workmanship regarding in the literature
How do you think like that
Yes what is your opinion about Premchand say art in
technique 
Premchand the greatest of uh Hindi novelist 
As far as his craftmanship is concerned I think he is the front rank
 front ranker 
Front ranker what do you mean by this front ranker 
Uh with the development of Hindi literature particularly in the
genre of novel I think Premchand initiated the novel form in its
presant context and proper form 
So he should be considered as the front ranker 
Front ranker
Front ranker 
Because by the word front ranker I do suppose that Premchand
initiated the novel form in its true contexts 
It its exact form 
Then by the word novel we suppose a such detail type of prose story
and prose composition which can contain a large theme in its full detail
charaterisation and everything else
Premchand utilises novel form in the in this context 
So he should be considered as a front ranker 
I think Premchand is a novelist of 
 You're you're considering about the quality
or the class of Premchand as a novelist 
No I just uh want to emphasise this about Premchand as
a novelist particularly about his characters characters 
 Characters 
What kind of characters he put in his novel
Oh yeah that is a very fine thing 
I think Premchand is primarily dealing with the characters related
to the rural life of India
He is always depicting the rural picture of countryside and the
villages in India particularly in the pre-Independence era and also 
about the Independence era 
Uh by this word pre-Independence I do mean that uh the
characters which do occur in the novels of Premchand like 
 Godan and some other novels like 
 Gaban and say all these novels
 there are lots of characters who just represent the different aspects
 different uh see the different colours and different categories
of the characters which are which uh are represented by our 
rural society as well class
 I feel I feel 
 I one word 
I think Premchand's characters are very simple
Yeah no doubt 
 They are very innocent
No doubt
They come from low status of life uh from villages 
they are living standard is very low yes and they are
actually exploited by the aristocrat classes 
 Yes 
Because you see Premchand was a true novelist in its sense
He just painted rural pictures in its real serial colour without
any artificial ornamentation
Premchand has represented rural society in its essence true
essence for example you see lots of farmers while toiling hard and
and reeling under odd type of atrocities and all type of I mean
exploitation at the hands of our feudal society and feudal bureaucratic set
up
He has represented them all 
Poverty is lying there all glaring poverty under the repressive
rules of taxes
All type of taxes being levied by the aristocratic and ruling set
up
These are all glaring and all visible clearly visible it is 
 I think so 
 I think his characters are tragic such
as uh we can take for example in Gaban 
 Gaban certainly
Uh Ramanath he is a steady character 
though I think he is an escapist yes 
He leaves the hard realities of life he runs away he and he
 doesn't show the he doesn't reveal the reality
 Ramanath 
 Yes 
He just manipulates something 
 I think in Gaban the
novel 
He does something but he says something
So there is no unification in his deed and speech
I think uh the novel Gaban 
which uh shot up the popularity of Premchand as a novelist too much
I think there is a psychological introspection into the
characters one word of Ramanath the character who has been affronted
by so many pecularities of his fate 
He is driven to Calcutta
He goes there
He uh joins a very low middle class family there
He one day goes and wins a a chess uh quiz and he is
able to get some prize
In his cheerly he was fascinated for buying so many ornaments to
his uh jewelleries to his wife 
 Can you tell me 
Can you tell me please how does he come to the real point
Ramanath Ramanath realises ultimately
What does he realises ultimately
Ramanath ultimately did realise that his fascination and his
over expense o on the items of uh high valued jewelleries
costly jewelleries was not a real thing
It did create lot of problems for him he had leave his flee
away from his home town Lucknow and he was forced to go to Calcutta
And there amidst lots of tragic situations and grim realities
 he come to this conclusion that we cannot move or flee away from the
hard realities which uh are the pre-dominence realities of life and
society
I think something like that 
What do you think uh about his art and technique 
 Premchand's 
Yes 
As art technique Premchand has used the picturised
pictures card I think
Premchand always 
 Pictures 
Uh uh by pictures I mean that Premchand always uh
puts before his readers or presents before his his readers of his
novels a true and lively and faithful picture of the surrounding or the
locale he is going to put in his novel
For example if he tries to mention a village then he starts
about picturising all the minute details
For example the roads full of dust
For example the pond full of hycinth and all even men and women
are bathing there and even cattles and animals are also there and
somebody is washing his utensils and somebody is washing his clothes
So this type of lively picturise then gives you a very healthy
and lively informatives he used to give yes regarding his
location
 Yes 
 You're you're you're very
correct 
His description is really very minute and clear when we read
And very live lively
 Haan lively
Yes but what do you think about the language which he
uses in his novels 
Uhm in terms of lang uh language I think Premchand
should be considered as a true artist in the sense he never goes for
artificial or ornamental language 
He always picks up the words from our local dialects 
Or even the word he use suggest a kind of our naturality
Suppose for example he always uses such type of dialogues which are
actually spoken by the native people in the remote village side
I think like that
 Yes 
And that gives a kind of naturality and directness to the
expression their livility and anything else
Yes you are very correct 
Really his languauage is very simple direct and very very
communicative 
Even his language is so simple that it is not difficult to
understand even a very uneducated person also can be able to
understand and can able can be able to enjoy his novel
One thing one one word I I do feel that the
language Premchand uses in his novels do present such categories and such
classes in our society
For example for the people belonging to lowest strata of
society Premchand uses the exact dialogue used by them
Yes very good very correct 
 And for example people belonging to suppose
suppose middle class or the upper middle class or the uh or the upper
class elite class gentry he uses that type of uh I mean the standard
dialect which has some real touches and everything etiquette and manner
all things that are possible
For example a feudal chief a zamindar talking
to his uh kinsmen and talking to his uh I mean servants he uses
there is a kind of two kinds of uh language there
The language used by the zamindar or the feudal
chief is something high something bombastic something one word 
and something high sounding but the language used by the servant is something
quitely different and there you come across a kind of representation of the
society in terms of the variation of the language itself
I think it is also a peculiar aspect
A a distinct achievement of Premchand as a craftmanship
regarding his novels being in the terms of use of languages of 
uhm do you think like that yes 
Alright is it okay
 Yes 
 Yes 
Now I would like to discuss about uh uh 
Premchands pictorial uses of language 
He uses pictorial languages also
He is his language is poetic very poetic 
Yes it is 
So one word 
 I'll show you some examples Mr
Yadav 
 Haan 
For Premchand makes fine or rather far fetched use of
 miseries and phrases
Phrases to communicate uh great ideas
Very direct ideas for example uh in a beautiful short story
 Kafan Kafan dealing with the 
tragic aspects of the li lives of a father and his son 
Premchand shows how the daughter-in-law of a man is dying 
How due to her pregnancy
And both son and father father-in-law both are so lazy
that they have just didn't care
They didn't care to their daughter-in-law and she is
dying
And which Premchand has shown in this way that uh while
the daughter-in-law is just on her on her death-bed crying up
mercilesly 
And at the same time son and father-in-law are sleeping in deep
slumber as if two azgars are sleeping 
So there the tongue two azgars do indicates such
a kind of pictorial touch and there lies the brilliance of use of
language in its pictorial manifestation
I think something like that
 Yes 
Yes correct
And you come across uh so many I mean numberless
examination of such things
And pictorial aspect has been superbly illustrated by
Premchand in his novels and particularly in his short stories
For example you see in Panch Parmeshwar
 also there is brilliant example of this pictorial
A representation and picturisation of uh khala
 and mausi for human's sake 
There is also uh her curly and white hairs and her cheeks 
uh swollen something like that
Yes that's true
Here you also come across some picturisation aspect
Yeah that's true
His his ideas are also very thoughtful
 If it is deep idea so simple
language in a very simple say 
 Yes no no doubt 
 Yes 
 For example you come across uh so many
examples Premchands original views on poverty honesty friendship 
these are the ideas India's age old tradition
In India the age old views on friendship trust cooperation
friendship all aspects have been yes dealt by Premchand in
different context and situations and that and those expressions
enable Premchand to outlet and vent his ideas in a very just stable and
very convincing manner
I think so
 Yes 
You are very correct
Now I would like to talk about his satirical aspect 
I think Premchand is a great satirist because he
exposes some foibles shortcomings weaknesses of the society 
 Because 
So for example you see in Gaban
 
Yes
He exposes all the short comings of the society
All the happening a real happening of the society
Yes satire as uh the great satirist 
 He is a great satirist
Yes yes
Satire as a great satirist and classical John Ryder has said
 satire as the amendment of vices by correction 
I think Premchand also in his uh all through his
literary career followed this dictum 
 Premchand's satirical purpose in his novels or short
stories wants to recorrect society 
To recorrect it if there are certain anomalies in society 
there are some waywardness in society there are some inherent defect 
So Premchand used his aesthetic features of literary literary
art to expose those irregularities which are prevelent in our society and
by his critical comments he tried to enlighten the people and be aware 
towards all these irregularities and if possible try to remove them
So that our society be such a place that we would like to be
living 
I think so
Premchand has always attacked on the exact causes of our
poverty exact causes of our illiteracy exact causes of of unawareness
regarding all the grim realities and grim difficulties that our society face
these days 
Particularly one must remember that Premchand was writing uh
uh uh Premchand wrote all his novels and short stories in the
pre-Independence era when India was not free and it was under the clutches of
British monarchy
All type of oppression were being carried on in the name
of British Queen after a pro proclamation of eighteen fifty-eight
So Premchand being a one word artist was always awake 
to see what our society is
What are its chief defects
And he always used the literary art to work as a st 
as an a stimulus to awaken the people from their deep slumber and
subconscious state to see the gruelling aspect of society
