<I>
Now in this what happens we have to take ammonium
chloride and clay lime in the ratio of three is to 
two 
What is the ratio ?
Three into to two
Now this I will arrange as in shown in the
Figure
See in your figure 
Now we heat the test tube and we pass it the gas is allowed to
pass over this line tower
Why ?
Because when it pass through line tower the ammonia becomes dry
It helps in drying ammonia 
 Ammonia 
Now as this gas is lighter than air it is collected by 
the gas jar is kept inverted over the line tower and
the gas is collected
 Line tower 
Have you understood ?
Yes
Now we take this is by we collect by the downward
displacement of
Air
Now we check some of the physical and chemical properties
of the gas 
Now first physical property
We see that it is has no colour
Inside is colourless gas 
 Gas 
Then the smell is strong 
It has a high strong smell 
 High strong smell 
Teacher noise 
Then 
So we can say 
What can we say about the smell that it is the pungent 
smell 
 Smell 
 What how it is smell ?
Pungent smell 
Then the next property is it is lighter than air
We have seen in collection of when we are collecting the gas
 we are collecting by the downward displacement of air 
 Air 
So it is naturally lighter than air 
 Lighter than air noise 
Now this gas is also soluble in water
How can we check ?
Take water and drift the gas which is coming out 
We see that the gas easily dissolves in water and hence we
say that the gas is soluble in water 
 Soluble in water noise 
Now this gas will neither support 
cumbustion nor it will burn itself
 Combustion 
 Burn 
So it is not a combustible substance nor it is supporting
 combustion 
 Combustion 
Means the candle will go off 
 Off 
Now this gas can be easily liquidified
On cooling you can liquidify 
This make into or turn into liquid and it can be compressed
Now have you understood the physical properties ?
Yes
Or no ?
Yes 
Now this we see the chemical properties of the gas
Ammonia when combined with water you get ammonium hydroxide
What do you get ?
 Ammonium hydroxide 
 Ammonium hydroxide 
The formula for ammoniun hydroxide is Na four 
 O H 
 O H 
N H four O H 
 O H 
What is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?
N H four O H 
Now this when a one or two words takes in 
hydrochloric acid is taken here the jar we see that white fumes
 of ammonium chloride are seen 
Means what ?
Ammonia react with hydrochloric gas to form 
 ammonium chloride 
 Hydrochloric gas 
 Ammonium chloride 
Now once again we repeat the physical 
properties 
 Properties 
Can anyone tell all the physical properties ?
Ammonia is a uh colourless gas 
It is lighter than air
It is it is highly soluble in water noise 
Come on next property Bhushan ?
Ammonia is colourless gas
Uh it has uh sharp pungent uh irritating odour 
It is lighter than air
It is soluble in water 
Uh it can be liquidified by cooling in low pressure 
It is combustible in air and uh it is not 
It is combustible in air ?
It is
It is not combustible in air
Neither it supports 
Combustion
Sit down 
Now the chemical first chemical property 
Yes Priyadarshan ?
Ammonia gas is basic 
Okay and how will you can you say that ammonia gas is basic
 ?
It turns red litmus to blue 
 Red litmus to blue 
Okay next property ?
Asha ?
It reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide
It reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide
 Ammonium hydroxide 
What is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?
You Kapil ?
N H three plus uh 
No teacher 
No ?
N H four
Four A 
What is the formula for uh ammonium hydroxide ?
N H four O H 
Now the gas when kept with turmeric paper the turmeric
paper turns
Yellow
Brown
Brown 
The yellow colour change to brown 
 Change to brown noise 
Now we see the next property 
You take the mixture of ammonium chloride and make lines 
and put it in a dry test tube 
Now just insert a hot platinium wire into it
Now the hot wire will supply heat to the mixture 
Yes 
And it reacts
Platinium is acting as a catalyst
Now what do you mean by the word catalyst ?
 Wire 
A substance which helps in chemical reaction 
One at a time 
The substance which helps in increasing the rate of
reaction but does not take part in the chemical reaction 
 Increasing the rate of reaction but does not take part
in the chemical reaction 
So what happens this gas oxidised to colourless
nitric oxide gas 
Ammonia gas oxidised to colourless nitric oxide gas 
The nitric oxide further combines with oxygen 
oxygen and from air and it becomes firm reddish brown 
coloured nitrogen dioxide 
 Oxygen 
 Brown coloured nitrogen dioxide 
This nitrogen dioxide fumes are seen in the test
tube 
 Test tube 
So yes what happens when clay lime and ammonium chloride 
 mixed in a taken in a dry test tube ?
When a hard platinium wire is inserted when a hard
platinum wire is inserted ammonia gets oxidised to form nitric oxide 
This nitric oxide further takes oxygen from air and you
get brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide 
 Dioxide 
Here platinium wire is acting as a catalyst 
 Catalyst 
So can anyone repeat the point 
Yes Uma ?
Hot platinium wire is inserted in the mixture of 
ammonium chloride and clay lime
Then hot uh then ammonia gas is oxidised into nitric 
ox nitric oxide
Nitric oxide takes oxygen from the air and that and
red brown fumes of nitrogen oxide we get 
Okay 
Now you please sit down 
Now we see the third property that BB-Work cold
concentrated hydrochloric acid is taken in a test tube and the
ammonia gas is passed over it 
It combines uh reacts with the acid and forms crystals of
 ammonium chloride 
 Chloride 
It forms crystals of ammonium chloride 
 Ammonium chloride 
So N H three plus H Cl gives you N
H four Cl 
 N H four Cl 
Have you understood ?
Yes 
Means it readily combines with H Cl forming crystals of
 ammonium chloride 
 Ammonium chloride 
Can anyone repeat the properties ?
Ammonium uh uh reacts with
Ammonia reacts with ?
Ammonium uh uh 
Ammonium reacts with the oxygen two times only this much
Ammonium reacts with the H Cl forming crystals of ammonium
chloride 
And tell the equation N H three 
 N H three plus H Cl gives you N H
 four Cl
Sit down noise 
Now we see that this ammonia reacts with cold
concentrated sulphuric acid and nitric acid 
So take sulphuric acid in one test tube and nitric acid in
 another test tube 
 Another test tube 
Pass ammonia gas through this test tube 
We see that it reacts with sulphuric acid giving you ammonium
sulphate crystals of ammonium sulphate and it reacts with nitric
acid giving you ammonium nitrate nitrate 
 Nitrate 
So which should which can you tell me the 
 summarize of the property that it gives salt it
forms salt with when it reacts with its acid the respective salts
are formed
Have you understood ?
Yes 
Now see this chlo hydrochloric acid it is forming
 chloride ammonium chloride
With sulphuric acid it is forming sulphate ammonium 
sulphate 
 Sulphate 
With nitric acid it is forming 
ammonium nitrate 
 Nitric 
 Ammonium nitrate 
Can anyone repeat these three properties noise 
Yes Samir ?
The the ammonium reacts with hydrochloric acid to
form and to form ammonium chloride and it reacts with 
sulphuric acid to form ammonium sulphate and it re reacts with 
uh nit nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate 
So any difficulty to you ?
No 
Or you have not understood ?
Yes we have understood 
So then we see the next property 
When ammonia gas is slowly passed through copper sulphate
solution what happens ?
A bluish white precipitate is formed 
A bluish white precipitate of copper hydroxide is formed
And when more ammonia gas is passed this precipitate
dissolves in the excess of ammonia and a solution of deep colour 
blue colour is formed 
Precipitate means 
What do you mean by precipitate ?
The residue which is remaining at the bottom 
The residue or the substance which remains at the 
bottom 
 Bottom 
Now see here when ammonia is passed through copper
sulphate you get a bluish white precipitate 
But when more ammonia is added this precipitate dissolves with
 and you get uh da deep blue colour solution 
Have you understood ?
Yes 
So when you pass more ammonia the precipitate divo
 dissolves and you get deep blue colour solution 
Can anyone summarize the properties ?
Summarize means tell in short 
All the properties or one property uh one student 
The che the chemical properties of ammonia are
 ammonia gas is basic which reacts with water and form ammonium
hydroxide 
It burns in atmosphere oxygen with yellow flame 
It combines with hydrogen chloride to form ammonium chloride 
It combines with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to form
nitric oxide 
It gives phosphate acid 
Ammonia reacts with the solution of salts of nitric to form
precipitate of that oxide 
So have you understood the chemical properties of ammonia ?
Uh yes 
Now we see the uses of ammonia 
Now first it is used in manufacturing
Manufaturing means making of washing soda and 
sodium bi-carbonate 
 Sodium bi-carbonate 
And also in nitric acid 
 Acid 
Now last year we had seen how ammonia is used in preparing
nitric acid when we were studying acid 
Now washing soda and sodium bicarbonate are different 
The formula for washing soda is sodium carbonate Na two
C O three 
 Three 
And for sodium bicarbonate it is Na H C O 
three 
 Na H C O three 
Now this sodium bicarbonate is used in preparing food or
 making the substance porous 
While washing soda is used in ma washing clothes 
Big clothes or blankets
This washing soda is used 
 Used 
Now it is used in uh manufacturing of fertilisers like
ammonium phosphate ammonium sulphate and urea 
Now these fertilisers help in increasing the food crop of
 uh by adding fertiliser what happens the quality and the quantity of the
food crop or the grains increases 
So these are used ammonium is used in as a fertiliser so
that we can get more yield of crop noise 
Now ammonia is also used in medicine 
Now solution of ammonia is used in laboratory as a reagent
Now what do you mean by the word reagent ?
What do you mean by the word reagent ?
Fooding agent which 
A substance which helps in chemical reaction 
A substance which is helping in chemical reaction
 is called as a reagent 
 Chemical reaction 
 Reagent 
Now this liquid ammonia is also used as solvent
We have seen what do you mean by solvent is in which the
substance gets dissolved 
 Dissolved 
So that solution in which the substance is getting
dissolved is called as a solvent 
 Solvent 
Now ammonia is also used as a solvent 
Some substance get dissolved in ammonia 
Now any difficulty in chemical properties and uses of ammonia ?
No noise 
Now just answer the questions orally noise 
Describe the laboratory of ?
What are the chemicals used in preparing ammonia by
laboratory method ?
Yes ?
Uh in laboratry methods uh ammonia ammonium chloride
and clay lime is used 
Ammonium chloride and clay lime is used 
 Clay lime is used 
What is the ratio of the mixture ?
The ratio of uh the mixture is three is to two 
Three is to two 
What is done to the mixture ?

What comes out of the tube ?
The ammonia gas comes out 
Through which it is passed ?
Yes ?
It is passed through delivery tube 
To the line tower through the line tower
It is passed through the line tower 
 Line tower 
Why is it passed through the line tower ?
Yes Ranjeet ?
To dry 
To dry the gas 
 Dry the gas 
How is the gas collected ?
Yes ?
By the downward uh downward displacement of jar 
So any difficulty in this
No
