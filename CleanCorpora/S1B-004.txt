Now in this  ammonium
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this  shown in the
""
""
Figure
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Because when it pass through line tower the  ammonia becomes dry
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now as this gas is lighter than air 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Air
""
""
""
of the 
""
""
""
We see that  no colour
""
""
Inside is colourless 
""
""
""
""
""
Then the smell is strong 
""
It has a 
""
""
""
""
""
Teacher 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this gas  is also soluble in water
""
How  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this gas can be easily liquidified
""
On cooling you can liquidify 
""
This make into or turn into  and it can be compressed
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Or no ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The formula for ammoniun hydroxide is Na 
""
""
""
""
""
""
N H 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
N H 
""
""
Now this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh 
""
It is lighter than air
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is combustible in air  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Neither it supports 
""
""
Combustion
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes Priyadarshan  ?
""
""
""
""
""
Okay and how will you can you say that ammonia gas is basic
""
""
It turns 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Four A 
""
""
What is the formula for uh ammonium hydroxide ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
paper turns
""
""
""
""
""
Brown
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You take the mixture of ammonium chloride 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
One at a time 
""
The substance which helps in  increasing the rate of
""
""
""
 Increasing the rate of reaction but does not take part
""
""
""
So what happens  colourless
""
""
Ammonia gas oxidised 
""
The nitric oxide further combines with 
oxygen and from air and it becomes 
coloured 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
tube 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
platinum wire is inserted ammonia gets oxidised 
""
This nitric oxide  and you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So can anyone repeat the point 
""
Yes Uma  ?
""
""
Hot platinium wire is inserted in the mixture 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now we see the third property  cold
concentrated hydrochloric acid  in a test tube and the
""
""
It combines uh  and forms crystals of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Have you understood ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ammonium uh uh  reacts with
""
""
Ammonia reacts with  ?
""
""
Ammonium uh uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And tell the equation 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sit down 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Pass ammonia gas through 
""
""
sulphate  nitric
acid giving you ammonium 
""
""
""
""
""
So which should which 
 that it gives salt it
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Now see this  hydrochloric acid it is forming
""
""
With sulphuric acid it is forming sulphate ammonium 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Can anyone repeat these three properties 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
blue colour is formed 
""
""
""
What do you mean by precipitate ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sulphate 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ammonium
""
""
It burns in atmosphere oxygen with 
""
""
""
""
""
""
It gives phosphate acid 
""
Ammonia reacts with the solution of salts of nitric to form
""
""
""
So have you understood the chemical properties  of ammonia ?
""
""
Uh yes 
""
""
""
""
Now first it is used in manufacturing
""
""
sodium bi-carbonate 
""
""
""
""
""
And also in nitric 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now washing soda and sodium bicarbonate are different 
""
The formula for washing soda is sodium carbonate Na 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this sodium bicarbonate is used in  preparing food or
""
""
""
""
""
""
This washing soda is 
""
""
""
""
""
Now it is used in  uh manufacturing of fertilisers like
""
""
Now these fertilisers  in increasing the food crop of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What do you mean by the word reagent ?
