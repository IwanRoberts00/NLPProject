Now in this  ammonium
chloride and 
two 
""
What is the ratio ?
""
""
Three  two
""
""
Now this  shown in the
""
""
Figure
""
""
See in your figure 
""
Now we heat the test tube  and we pass it the gas is allowed to
pass over  this line tower
""
Why  ?
""
Because when it pass through line tower the  ammonia becomes dry
""
It helps in drying 
""
""
""
""
""
Now as this gas is lighter than air 
the gas jar is kept inverted over the  and
the gas is collected
""
""
""
""
""
Have you understood ?
""
""
Yes
""
""
Now we take  we collect by the downward
displacement of
""
""
Air
""
""
Now we check some of the  physical and chemical properties
of the 
""
Now first physical property
""
We see that  no colour
""
""
Inside is colourless 
""
""
""
""
""
Then the smell is strong 
""
It has a 
""
""
""
""
""
Teacher 
""
""
Then 
""
So we can say 
""
What can we say about the smell that it is the pungent 
smell 
""
""
""
""
""
 smell ?
""
""
Pungent smell 
""
""
Then the next property is  it is lighter than air
""
We have seen in collection of  when we are collecting the gas
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it is naturally 
""
""
""
""
""
Now this gas  is also soluble in water
""
How  ?
""
Take 
""
We see that  hence we
say that 
""
""
""
""
""
Now this gas 
cumbustion  itself
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it is not a combustible substance  nor it is supporting
""
""
""
""
""
""
Means the candle will go 
""
""
""
""
""
Now this gas can be easily liquidified
""
On cooling you can liquidify 
""
This make into or turn into  and it can be compressed
""
""
Now have you understood the physical properties ?
""
""
Yes
""
""
Or no ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Now this  gas
""
""
Ammonia when combined  you get ammonium hydroxide
""
""
What  you get ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The formula for ammoniun hydroxide is Na 
""
""
""
""
""
""
N H 
""
""
""
""
""
What is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?
""
""
N H 
""
""
Now this 
hydrochloric acid  white fumes
""
""
Means what ?
""
Ammonia react with 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now once again we repeat the 
properties 
""
""
""
""
""
Can anyone tell all the physical properties  ?
""
""
Ammonia is a 
""
It is lighter than air
""
It is 
""
""
Come on next property Bhushan ?
""
""
Ammonia is colourless gas
""
Uh 
""
It is lighter than air
""
It is soluble in water 
""
Uh it can be liquidified by cooling in low pressure 
""
It is combustible in air and uh it is not 
""
""
It is combustible in air  ?
""
It is
""
""
It is not combustible in air
""
""
Neither it supports 
""
""
Combustion
""
""
Sit down 
""
Now the chemical first chemical property 
""
Yes Priyadarshan  ?
""
""
Ammonia gas is basic 
""
""
Okay and how will you can you say that ammonia gas is basic
 ?
""
It turns 
""
""
""
""
""
Okay next property  ?
""
Asha  ?
""
""
It reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide
""
""
It reacts with water and forms  ammonium hydroxide
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?
""
You  ?
""
""
N H 
""
""
No teacher 
""
""
No ?
""
""
N H 
""
""
Four A 
""
""
What is the formula for uh ammonium hydroxide ?
""
""
N H 
""
""
Now the gas when kept with turmeric paper  the turmeric
paper turns
""
""
Yellow
""
""
Brown
""
""
Brown 
""
""
The yellow colour 
""
""
""
""
""
Now we see the next property 
""
You take the mixture of ammonium chloride 
and put it in a dry 
""
Now just insert a hot platinium  into it
""
""
Now the hot wire will supply 
""
Yes 
""
And it reacts
""
Platinium is acting as a catalyst
""
Now what do you mean by the word catalyst ?
""
""
""
""
""
A substance which helps in chemical reaction 
""
""
One at a time 
""
The substance which helps in  increasing the rate of
reaction but does not take part in the chemical reaction 
""
""
 Increasing the rate of reaction but does not take part
in the chemical reaction 
""
""
So what happens  colourless
nitric oxide 
""
Ammonia gas oxidised 
""
The nitric oxide further combines with 
oxygen and from air and it becomes 
coloured 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This nitrogen dioxide fumes  test
tube 
""
""
""
""
""
So yes what happens when clay lime and ammonium chloride 
 ?
""
When a hard platinium  when a hard
platinum wire is inserted ammonia gets oxidised 
""
This nitric oxide  and you
get brown fumes of nitrogen 
""
""
""
""
""
Here platinium wire is acting as a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So can anyone repeat the point 
""
Yes Uma  ?
""
""
Hot platinium wire is inserted in the mixture 
ammonium chloride and clay lime
""
Then hot uh 
ox  nitric oxide
""
Nitric oxide takes oxygen from the air  and
red brown fumes of nitrogen oxide we get 
""
""
Okay 
""
Now you please sit down 
""
Now we see the third property  cold
concentrated hydrochloric acid  in a test tube and the
ammonia gas 
""
It combines uh  and forms crystals of
""
""
""
""
""
""
It 
""
""
""
""
""
So N H  N
H 
""
""
""
""
""
Have you understood ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Means it readily combines with H Cl  forming crystals of
""
""
""
""
""
""
Can anyone repeat the properties  ?
""
""
Ammonium uh uh  reacts with
""
""
Ammonia reacts with  ?
""
""
Ammonium uh uh 
""
""
Ammonium reacts with the oxygen two times only this much
""
""
Ammonium reacts with the H Cl forming crystals of ammonium
chloride 
""
""
And tell the equation 
""
""
 gives you N H
 Cl
""
""
Sit down 
""
Now we see that  cold
concentrated sulphuric acid 
""
So take  sulphuric acid in one test tube and nitric acid in
""
""
""
""
""
""
Pass ammonia gas through 
""
We see that it reacts with sulphuric acid giving you ammonium
sulphate  nitric
acid giving you ammonium 
""
""
""
""
""
So which should which 
 that it gives salt it
forms salt with when it reacts with its  respective salts
are formed
""
Have you understood ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
Now see this  hydrochloric acid it is forming
 ammonium chloride
""
With sulphuric acid it is forming sulphate ammonium 
sulphate 
""
""
""
""
""
With 
ammonium nitrate 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Can anyone repeat these three properties 
""
Yes Samir  ?
""
""
The  hydrochloric acid to
form 
sulphuric acid to form ammonium sulphate and it 
uh 
""
""
So any difficulty to you  ?
""
""
No 
""
""
Or you have not understood ?
""
""
Yes we have understood 
""
""
So then 
""
When ammonia gas  through copper sulphate
solution  what happens ?
""
A bluish white precipitate 
""
A bluish white precipitate of  is formed
""
""
And when more  this precipitate
dissolves in 
blue colour is formed 
""
Precipitate means 
""
What do you mean by precipitate ?
""
The residue which is remaining at the 
""
The residue or the 
bottom 
""
""
""
""
""
Now see here  ammonia is passed through copper
sulphate 
""
But when more ammonia is added  this precipitate dissolves with
""
""
Have you understood ?
""
""
Yes 
""
""
So when you pass more  divo
""
""
Can anyone  ?
""
Summarize means tell in short 
""
All the properties 
""
""
The  the chemical properties of ammonia are
 ammonium
hydroxide 
""
It burns in atmosphere oxygen with 
""
It combines with hydrogen chloride to form ammonium chloride 
""
It combines with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to form
nitric oxide 
""
It gives phosphate acid 
""
Ammonia reacts with the solution of salts of nitric to form
precipitate of that oxide 
""
""
So have you understood the chemical properties  of ammonia ?
""
""
Uh yes 
""
""
Now we see 
""
Now first it is used in manufacturing
""
Manufaturing means 
sodium bi-carbonate 
""
""
""
""
""
And also in nitric 
""
""
""
""
""
Now last year we had seen how ammonia is used in preparing
nitric acid when we were studying 
""
Now washing soda and sodium bicarbonate are different 
""
The formula for washing soda is sodium carbonate Na 
C O 
""
""
""
""
""
And for sodium bicarbonate it is 
three
""
""
""
""
""
Now this sodium bicarbonate is used in  preparing food or
""
""
While washing soda is used in 
""
Big clothes  or blankets
""
This washing soda is 
""
""
""
""
""
Now it is used in  uh manufacturing of fertilisers like
ammonium phosphate 
""
Now these fertilisers  in increasing the food crop of
 uh by adding fertiliser what happens the quality and the quantity of the
food crop or the grains 
""
So these are used ammonium is used in  so
that we can get more yield of 
""
Now ammonia is also used in 
""
Now solution of ammonia  is used in laboratory as a reagent
""
""
Now what do you mean by the word reagent  ?
""
What do you mean by the word reagent ?
""
""
Fooding agent 
""
""
A substance which helps in chemical reaction 
""
""
A substance which is helping in  chemical reaction
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now this  liquid ammonia is also used as solvent
""
We have seen what do you mean by solvent is  in which the
substance gets 
""
""
""
""
""
So that  solution in which the substance is getting
dissolved is called as a 
""
""
""
""
""
Now ammonia is also used as a 
""
Some substance get dissolved in 
""
Now any difficulty in chemical properties  and uses of ammonia ?
""
""
No 
""
""
Now just 
""
Describe the laboratory of  ?
""
What are the chemicals  by
laboratory method  ?
""
Yes  ?
""
""
Uh  uh ammonia ammonium chloride
and clay lime is used 
""
""
Ammonium chloride and 
""
""
""
""
""
What is the ratio of  ?
""
""
The ratio of uh the mixture is three is to two 
""
""
Three is to two 
""
""
What is done to the mixture  ?
""
""
The mixture is heated 
""
""
The mixture is 
""
""
""
""
""
What comes  ?
""
""
The ammonia gas comes out 
""
""
Through which it is passed  ?
""
Yes  ?
""
""
It is passed through delivery tube 
""
""
To the line tower through the line tower
""
It is passed through the 
""
""
""
""
""
Why is it passed through the line tower  ?
""
Yes Ranjeet  ?
""
""
To dry 
""
""
To 
""
""
""
""
""
How is the gas collected  ?
""
Yes ?
""
""
By the downward 
""
""
So any difficulty in this
""
""
No
