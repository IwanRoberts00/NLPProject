Uh I must initially say that I am really grateful to
 Saraswati for having accepted this invitation and uh agreed to
visit our department 
I think she is first uh let's say who has come from
such a long distance cough 
Saraswati from Madras 
Uh she is a distinguished scholar and I'm happy
that she is here with us this afternoon 
Now according to the official speaking the requirements of
the open defence the candidate has to sum up the argument of his
thesis in about twenty minutes about whether it should be convenient
Officially you can take an hour laughs but I'm
 sure you won't like him laughter 
So for about twenty minutes you speak and sum up 
the main arguments of thesis and findings accentuating the
findings 
So I request him uh to summarise it 
And then after that uh when he receives uh sir then after
that 
Questions
Questions from from the external experts 
other than the referees these questions should be treated two words
 and then questions raised by the referees both the referees
 cough and then if necessary those who are present here they will
also raise their questions if required sometime from the candidate
So I now request uh Mr Karande to sum up his thesis 
Thank you sir 
The studying two words uh some features of educated
Indian English speech an one word study uh has five chapters
besides introduction 
In the introduction uh some background has been explained
 as what led me to pick up the study 
So some small work that I did in a partial fulfillment of
 M Phil degree so that led me to uh switch on to these topics 
Even though the focus of the one word study was
 uh an articulate in phonetics 
But here the focus is shifted to one word 
phonetics 
So again two things one is uh collection of data
 that is Elicited data and Corpus data 
So Elicited data has been rather you know not paid much
attention for one or two reasons 
And Corpus data has been uh preferred over here 
For two reasons mainly and the one reason is in elicited
data if the data happens to be the words are word-strings or
sentences then this sentences and words you know most of the time
they are cough isolated from the context 
And so they are likely to loose some phonetic features 
And so corpus data which is uh a continous speech may be or
discussion or news particularly here the news reading 
So it being a connected speech plus rapid speech you know 
So all the required features that is one word features
 of the strings and words required they were all intact or
they were got all intact in this data 
And so this corpus data it was preferred to the elicited data
 cough 
So the the limiting why this uh chapter or why this area
 was chosen that is uh media news that is news broadcast on T V
and uh Radio 
So one reason uh main reason for choosing this area was 
uh that now-a-days the media in particular T V it has been a common
feature over 
So for collecting data or choosing news or the news readers
 or the news that we get atleast thrice a day so it has been
invariably permanent feature on T V and this uh Radio 
Plus the news reader chosen uh to read news either on T
V or on Radio you know they normally represent all the linguistic
communities uh that exist in India 
And so this representation of the linguistic communities 
they have been rather you know collected over years
So these are the two reasons 
So one more reason behind choosing this area and the topic is
So normally we look up to this media news as a kind of
English that might be followed by the listeners of T V and Radio so
 sometime you know it is regarded as norm from the listeners point
of view 
And uh standard from uh say T V or Radio point of view
So for these reasons you know this area was chosen by me
 here over here interruption 
Chapter number three is about uh Spectrography 
So spectrography i it has been
given a due importance in the study only because without 
spectrographic analysis or the one word analysis the study would
have been uh simply impossible 
So this sophisticated device or this gadget you know it has all
the uh facilities you know that gives uh over here the visual
representation of all the one word features 
So once we feed a sound or any sound segment to the machine it
gives us uh the visual impression of the sound on the monitor 
And that monitor gives us that sound in a one word 
feature 
So it records uh frequency it records amplitude it
records du duration it records 
one word it records a one word you know 
So all this features they decide what sound is produced or
what sound is pronounced by a speaker over here 
And so this again you know place of the articulation of a sound
segment or the manner of the articulation of a particular segment
you know that can be to a great extent is decided by looking at
or studying or interpreting these spectrographs
And so spectograph has its own place in linguistic study 
The next chapter is analysis of the data 
In analysis of the data these three areas chosen for the study
So the first is the duration and the four pairs of uh 
pure vowels particularly long and short pairs 
These four pairs have been chosen so the purpose behind
choosing this four pairs was because it has been assumed or it has
been uh talked of much by the scholars 
All the people in this area that is Indian speakers of English
 that is educated Indian speakers of English cough they
hardly maintain the short long distinction in their speech you know 
And so for these reasons these four pairs they were
selected or these were they were chosen as one of the topics over
here 
So here while deciding the boundaries of the vocalic
 segments over here some difficulties were there but to get over
the difficulties certain strategies were to be thought out 
And here the strategy is uh spectrograph machine or this
device came to uh my assistance here because here the spectrograph
 spectrograph machine it shows you which is a vowel and which
is a consonant 
So these features or the certain features on the basis of those
features it was possible to catch or it was possible to decide the
segment boundaries 
So with the help of this segment boundaries this pure vowels or
the vocalic segments they were detected or they were located and
their duration it was ultimately again you know decided upon 
So in this uh chapter or in this analysis it has been found
out that is the distinction between short and long even though it
is not very clear at the level of section but it is still there 
There is uh some other reason why it is not that clear 
But the distinction a short and long it is there in the
speech of educated Indian English 
Of course you know if we compare uh this phenomenon with
the English spoken by the native speaker of English then it is very clear
 that is length of any voc uh vocalic 
 item or the length of any vocalic uh segment you know is not as
much as the length of the particular or the same vocalic segment
pronounced by the native speaker 
And there is obvious reason 
But within the system used by any educated Indian English 
uh speaker you know he does maintain a particular kind of uh
relationship or does maintain a particular kind of system 
And where he distinguishes a short counterpart from its 
long one 
So this is one finding over there
The second area or the second topic chosen so it is a
dipthong 
So on the dipthong three dipthongs
Again you know even uh professor Bansal so he treats just
 one dipthong that is A or OU which is there he says in uh
educated Indian uh English speaker and others too which I
deal with over here
So they are A and another is AE so these two so my
findings in this study they are very much confirmed with uh Dr
 Bansal's and uh that Bansal's conclusions or his
findings and findings by uh may be Professor Kachru and Nihalani 
 two words these people also
But here it was an attempt to verify it with the help of uh 
 one word study of one word means over here
So one thing uh the one way to verify dipthongs it
was a spectrograph 
So in spectrograph one one word feature that is a
 one word and these one word were decided whether a
particular vowel uh pronounced by a speaker was a pure vowel or 
a dipthong 
There was a second one word or the F two what we
say or the hub theory 
So these hub theory or the F two second one word it
gives a clear cut picture of the dipthong as well as of a pure vowel
If it happens to be a pure vowel then F two or the second 
one word it is straight
It is in a straight position and when it is a dipthong 
then there is uh uh frequency shift or there is a F two transition
And these F two transition it is in terms of frequency over
there
So it can be seen very clearly with the help of a
spectrogram which sound or which vocalic sound is a pure vowel and which
is not or which is a dipthong 
So the finding are these that is most of the Indian
educated Indian speakers you know so some of them you know there are
certain news readers that is educated Indian uh speakers you know 
of English that who do maintain this dipthongs who do pronounce a
dipthong but the second element is not as stressed it is as boldly
pronounced as it should have been
And so the shift or the transition shift or F two shift F
two transition it is not very much bold over there
And so at the level of perception uh even though there is a
transition shift even though there is F two transition that F two
transition is not very much felt by the listeners 
The third topic or the third area chosen for the study it
is stress 
Even in case of stress uh it is said uh that Indian
speakers of English educated Indian speakers of English they do not
confirm with the native speakers of English as far as stress is
concerned 
But there is a some pattern 
But which pattern in the present study it has been found out 
I particularly neglected monosyllabic disyllabic and even
trisyllabic words which form again the great part of anybodys
speech 
So multisyllabic words that is words with more than three
syllables 
So they are called the multisyllable in the present study 
And these words you know they have been studied uh for the
purpose of stress 
Over here it is found there is a word with prefixes and
words without prefixes 
So words without prefixes as far as stress pattern is concerned
 they give a very chaotic picture 
There is no pattern as such emerges when these words are
studied but the word with prefixes you know they uh they maintain a
kind of uh stress pattern you know 
Of course there are three divisions under this 
The first division in the first division uh the prefix
doesn't receive any stress as such 
But the remaining syllable one of them does receive a primary
stress 
The second category or the second division of words that is
multi syllabic words with prefixes there uh this prefixes
receive primary stress and secondary stress falls on some other
 uh syllable 
And the third division is uh where the prefix receive the
secondary stress 
And the primary stress again falls on some other syllable you know
So the third type there is a variant the prefix receive
the primary stress you know it emerges as a pattern in the speech of
educated Indian English speech a speakers you know 
And here this pattern it comes out or it can be regarded as 
or the particular stress pattern used by educated Indian English speakers
So this is the analysis so naturally the conclusions drawn
 conclusions reached at so as far as duration is concerned 
So the study says uh this distinction between short
and long it is there 
The one reason why it is not very dominant or dominantly 
one word at the level of again we can say listening 
And the one reason is it is uh due to the mother tongue or
it is due to uh the way we speak English because whenever the speech
tempo goes up or it increases so our habit that is the Marathi
speakers or even Indians you know they pronounced most of the words
equally bold 
And because of this you know when the tempo increases or goes
up all the segments including vocalic and again we can say
consonants they get compressed 
And because of this this vocalic parts or the vocalic segments
you know and their duration it is not felt very much 
But in other languages where weak form feature exists 
over there when uh this tempo increases or it again we can say 
the speaker speeds up himself then he counters these weak forms 
But he does not uh or his vocalic uh parts of the vocalic
segments and particularly stress are stretched stressed uh 
you see vowels they are not affected to that extent 
And so their duration remains uh rather unaffected you know
On the other hand these vowels that receive primary stress
 they are affected as far as duration is concerned 
Uh the next is uh a dipthong this area and here the
conclusions 
The problem dipthong taken up for the study so it is said
that it is true that these all the three dipthongs most of the
time they are pronounced as pure vowels and not as dipthongs 
There are news reader or some news reader who do
pronounce dipthongs as dipthongs
But their number is very low 
And since it is very low you know and again the F two
transition that is not very much felt 
So this percentage which is upto fifteen percent or twenty percent
you know so it can't have the central place in the conclusion 
And the third is the stress 
So according to me the stress the secondary stress or the
primary stress and the tertiary stress 
The tertiary stress this feature is not at all found in 
educated Indian English speech 
And the secondary stress and the primary stress there is a
 again a kind of confusion but some pattern does emerge
 whenever it is a multisyllabic word and that too again you know 
 which a which is which has the prefix 
So another category of words which is not multisyllable 
most of the time but which has the functional stress in it 
So the words with a functional stress so the same word 
with a same one word shape which is used either or not or a verb
you know so they receive a stress at different places when they
change their grammatical categories 
So over here all the news reader that is educated Indian
English speakers you know they very well maintained this distinction
such as now two words and so on 
Here you know they emerges again we can say very successful
speakers of educated Indian English speech
