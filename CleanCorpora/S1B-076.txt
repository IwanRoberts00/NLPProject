Uh  say that I am really grateful to
 and uh agreed to
visit our

I think she is first uh  who has come from
such a long distance 
""
Saraswati from Madras 
""
Uh  happy
that she is 
""
Now  official speaking the requirements of
the open defence  the argument of his
thesis  whether it should be convenient
""
""
Officially you can take an hour  I'm
""
""
""
So for about twenty minutes 
the main arguments of  accentuating the
findings 
""
So I request him 
""
And then after that  sir then after
that 
""
""
Questions
""
""
Questions 
other than the referees  two words
 both the referees
 and then if necessary those who are present here they will
also  from the candidate
""
""
So I now request uh 
""
""
Thank you sir 
""
The studying  educated
Indian English speech  uh has five chapters
besides introduction 
""
In the introduction  background has been explained
""
""
So  did in a partial fulfillment of
""
""
Even though  study was
""
""
But here 
phonetics 
""
So  collection of data
""
""
So Elicited data  rather you know not paid much
attention for one or two reasons 
""
And Corpus data has been uh 
""
For two reasons mainly  in elicited
data  word-strings or
sentences  most of the time
they are 
""
And so they are likely to 
""
And so corpus data  or
discussion or news 
""
So it being a connected speech plus rapid speech you know 
""
So all the required  features
 or
they were 
""
And so this corpus data it was preferred to the  elicited data
""
""
So the  uh chapter or why this area
 that is news broadcast on T V
and uh 
""
So one reason 
uh that now-a-days  the media in particular T V it has been a common
feature over 
""
So for collecting data  or the news readers
 so it has been
invariably permanent feature on T V and 
""
Plus  either on T
V or on Radio you know  normally represent all the linguistic
communities 
""
And so this representation 
they have been  rather you know collected over years
""
So these are 
""
So one more reason  behind choosing this area and the topic is
""
""
So normally we look up to  as a kind of
English  of T V and Radio so
 from the listeners point
of view 
""
And uh  Radio point of view
""
""
So for these  by me
""
""
Chapter number three is about uh 
""
So spectrography  has been
given a due importance in the study only because 
spectrographic analysis  analysis the study would
have been 
""
So this sophisticated device  or this gadget you know it has all
the  uh over here the visual
representation of all the 
""
So once we feed  a sound or any sound segment to the machine it
gives us 
""
And that monitor 
feature 
""
So it records uh  it
records 
one word 
""
So all this features  what sound is produced or
what sound is pronounced by 
""
And so this again you know place of the articulation of a sound
segment  of a particular segment
you know that can be  looking at
or studying or interpreting these spectrographs
""
And so spectograph 
""
The next chapter 
""
In analysis of the data  these three areas chosen for the study
""
""
So the first is the duration 
pure vowels 
""
These four pairs have been chosen  so the purpose behind
choosing  or it has
been 
""
All the people in this area  that is Indian speakers of English
 they
hardly maintain 
""
And so  they were
selected  they were chosen as one of the topics over
here 
""
So  of the vocalic
 but to get over
the difficulties 
""
And here the strategy is  or this
device came to  because here the spectrograph
 and which
is 
""
So these features  or the certain features on the basis of those
features  to catch or it was possible to decide the
segment boundaries 
""
So with the help of this segment boundaries  this pure vowels or
the vocalic  detected or they were located and
their duration it was 
""
So in this  it has been found
out  even though it
is not very clear at the level of section but it is still there 
""
There is uh some other reason 
""
But the distinction  it is there in the
speech of educated Indian English 
""
Of course you know if we compare  with
the English spoken by the native speaker of English  then it is very clear
""
 uh segment you know is not as
much as  the particular or the same vocalic segment
pronounced by 
""
And there is obvious reason 
""
But within the system 
uh speaker you know  uh
relationship 
""
And where he distinguishes 
long one 
""
So this is one finding over there
""
The second  a
dipthong 
""
So  three dipthongs
""
Again you know even  so he treats just
 uh
educated Indian  I
deal with over here
""
So they are A  so my
findings  Dr
 or his
findings and findings by 
 these people also
""
But here it was an attempt 
 means over here
""
So  it
was 
""
So in spectrograph  that is a
 were decided whether a
particular vowel 
a dipthong 
""
There was a second  what we
say or the hub theory 
""
So these hub theory or the F two  it
gives a clear cut picture  a pure vowel
""
""
If it happens to be a pure vowel then 
one word  straight
""
It is 
then there is uh  or there is a F two transition
""
""
And these F two transition it is in terms of  frequency over
there
""
So it can be seen  a
spectrogram  which sound or which vocalic sound is a pure vowel and which
is not or which is a dipthong 
""
So the finding are these  the Indian
educated Indian speakers you know  there are
certain news readers 
of English  this dipthongs who do pronounce a
dipthong but the second element is not as stressed  it is as boldly
pronounced as it should have been
""
And so  F
two transition  it is not very much bold over there
""
And so at the level of perception  uh even though there is a
transition shift  that F two
transition is not very much felt by the listeners 
""
The third topic  it
is stress 
""
Even in case of stress  uh that Indian
speakers of English  they do not
confirm with  as far as stress is
concerned 
""
But there is a some pattern 
""
But which pattern in the present study it has been found out 
""
I particularly neglected  disyllabic and even
trisyllabic words which form  anybodys
speech 
""
So  that is words with more than three
syllables 
""
So they are called the multisyllable in the present study 
""
And these words you know they have been studied  uh for the
purpose of stress 
""
Over here it is found  and
words without prefixes 
""
So words without prefixes  as far as stress pattern is concerned
""
""
There is no pattern as such emerges  when these words are
studied  uh they maintain a
kind of uh stress pattern you know 
""
Of course there are 
""
The first division  uh the prefix
doesn't receive any stress as such 
""
But the remaining syllable  one of them does receive a primary
stress 
""
The second category or the second division of words  that is
multi  this prefixes
receive  falls on some other
""
""
And the third division is  the prefix receive the
secondary stress 
""
And the primary stress again falls on some other syllable you know
""
""
So the third type  the prefix receive
the primary stress you know  in the speech of
educated Indian English speech 
""
And here this pattern 
or the particular stress pattern used by educated Indian  English speakers
""
""
So this is the analysis  naturally the conclusions drawn
""
""
So  short
and long 
""
The one reason why it is not very dominant 
one word 
""
And the one reason is  the mother tongue or
it is due to  because whenever the speech
tempo  that is the Marathi
speakers or even Indians you know  they pronounced most of the words
equally bold 
""
And because of this you know when the  tempo increases or goes
up  vocalic and again we can say
consonants they get compressed 
""
And because of this  this vocalic parts or the vocalic segments
you know and their duration it is not 
""
But in other languages where 
over there when 
the speaker speeds up himself 
""
But he does not  uh parts of the vocalic
segments 
you see vowels 
""
And so their duration remains  uh rather unaffected you know
""
""
On the other hand  that receive primary stress
""
""
Uh the next is  this area and here the
conclusions 
""
The problem dipthong  so it is said
that it is true  most of the
time they are pronounced as 
""
There are  who do
pronounce  dipthongs as dipthongs
""
But their number is very low 
""
And since it is very low you know  and again the F two
transition that is not very much felt 
""
So this percentage which is upto fifteen percent or twenty percent
you know 
""
And the third is the stress 
""
So according to me the stress  or the
primary stress and the tertiary stress 
""
The tertiary stress 
educated Indian English speech 
""
And the secondary stress and the primary stress  a
 but some pattern does emerge
""
""
""
So another category of words 
most of the time 
""
So the words with a functional stress 
with a same  or a verb
you know  when they
change their grammatical categories 
""
So over here  that is educated Indian
English speakers you know  this distinction
such as 
""
Here you know they emerges  again we can say very successful
speakers of educated Indian English speech
