<I>
""
""
Uh  say that I am really grateful to
""
""
""
""
such a long distance 
""
""
""
""
that she is 
""
""
the open defence  the argument of his
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
findings 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Questions
""
""
Questions 
""
""
 and then if necessary those who are present here they will
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  did in a partial fulfillment of
""
""
""
""
""
But here 
phonetics 
""
So  collection of data
""
""
So Elicited data  rather you know not paid much
attention for one or two reasons 
""
And Corpus data has been uh 
""
""
data  word-strings or
""
they are 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it being a connected speech plus rapid speech you know 
""
""
 or
""
""
And so this corpus data it was preferred to the  elicited data
""
""
So the  uh chapter or why this area
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So these are 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Chapter number three is about uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
gives us 
""
And that monitor 
""
""
""
records 
one word 
""
So all this features  what sound is produced or
""
""
""
segment  of a particular segment
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So the first is the duration 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
hardly maintain 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
device came to  because here the spectrograph
""
""
""
""
features  to catch or it was possible to decide the
""
""
So with the help of this segment boundaries  this pure vowels or
""
""
""
""
""
is not very clear at the level of section but it is still there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
pronounced by 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The second  a
""
""
""
""
Again you know even  so he treats just
""
""
deal with over here
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But here it was an attempt 
 means over here
""
So  it
""
""
""
""
""
a dipthong 
""
There was a second  what we
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
one word  straight
""
It is 
then there is uh  or there is a F two transition
""
""
""
""
""
""
spectrogram  which sound or which vocalic sound is a pure vowel and which
""
""
""
""
""
of English  this dipthongs who do pronounce a
""
pronounced as it should have been
""
""
two transition  it is not very much bold over there
""
And so at the level of perception  uh even though there is a
transition shift  that F two
""
""
""
is stress 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I particularly neglected  disyllabic and even
""
speech 
""
So  that is words with more than three
syllables 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
There is no pattern as such emerges  when these words are
""
""
""
Of course there are 
""
""
doesn't receive any stress as such 
""
""
stress 
""
""
""
receive  falls on some other
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
educated Indian English speech 
""
And here this pattern 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it is due to  because whenever the speech
""
speakers or even Indians you know  they pronounced most of the words
""
""
And because of this you know when the  tempo increases or goes
""
""
""
""
""
""
But in other languages where 
""
the speaker speeds up himself 
""
But he does not  uh parts of the vocalic
""
you see vowels 
""
And so their duration remains  uh rather unaffected you know
""
""
""
""
""
""
conclusions 
""
The problem dipthong  so it is said
""
time they are pronounced as 
""
There are  who do
""
""
But their number is very low 
""
""
transition that is not very much felt 
""
So this percentage which is upto fifteen percent or twenty percent
""
""
And the third is the stress 
""
""
""
""
The tertiary stress 
""
""
""
 but some pattern does emerge
""
""
""
So another category of words 
""
""
So the words with a functional stress 
""
you know  when they
""
""
So over here  that is educated Indian
""
such as 
""
""
speakers of educated Indian English speech
