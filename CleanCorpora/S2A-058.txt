I first became interested in fabric painting when I saw  it
""
""
So I went out and got a whole lot of colours  I
first started out by  on pieces of
uh 
""
I took the designs from 
and uh 
""
Then uhm 
""
Now 
""
 done a few designs on this pillow case with fabric
paints
""
In the beginning I diluted it very thickly  didn't use much
water
""
So 
""
It hasn't come very well 
""
So uhm 
and make the colour more refined 
""
Now I use all sorts of colours 
violet indigo 
""
You can use any colour on any kind of cloth  and the results
are fantastic
""
Now have a look at this bedsheet 
""
This is something I tried 
""
This is a mixture of all sorts of 
""
""
""
You can do the same sort of thing on paper
""
Take a piece of string  put it between two
pieces of paper  and pull it out
slowly 
""
Now the same 
""
But the  and I have
streaked the bedsheet all over  the results that you can see
are fantastic 
""
It has given it a very printed kind of look  very
professional 
""
And not only that I spray painted 
with different colours  to
mark a  of outline all round
the end of the bedsheet 
""
So uhm 
""
Now uh  this was just a trial actually starting with sort of
bedsheet 
""
Now here is another piece of cloth 
""
This is a dress material 
""
I have decided to go a step further and try out this kind of fabric
painting on dress material 
""
I have done the same sort of thing but  uhm
""
""
The moulds are potatoes 
""
These can be used as moulds for printing in different colours all
over the material 
and streaked it 
""
You can even draw your own little stars here and there and  see
like this 
""
Now all that has to be done with this material  is to be cut out
and sewn into a dress 
""
I still haven't tried making a dress out of it yet 
once I do it the results are good enough I am going to start selling them
""
""
And I am sure the market is going to be quite good for this kind of
stuff because its quite original  and I don't think anyone has quite
tried this sort of thing before 
""
You can do almost anything with fabric painting
""
You can paint curtains  you can
paint 
table-cloths 
""
All sorts of things you use around the house even 
just little designs  and anything
else you fancy actually 
""
Uhm  fast becoming quite
popular  especially for curtains and other things used around the house
""
But  this is the first time I am trying fabric painting on
dresses 
""
People have tried it before on uh 
other things but I am going to start something new now I am going to start
fabric painting on Jeans  other articles which haven't been
painted so far 
""
Now uhm 
""
The modern trend is not to wear Jeans that are flawlessly clean
""
""
But rather  to be speckled with all sorts of colours and paints
and uh 
""
In other words 
""
People prefer to wear them dirty 
""
Now instead of making Jeans dirty  I think a better idea would
be to paint the dirt on 
""
But not exactly paint the dirt on  we would rather paint
patches on  or
potatoes and ladysfingers 
""
You won't believe that a pair of Jeans could be made to look like
this 
""
Now this looks  it has been done in a factory
 and few of this
 people
are willing to pay a fair quite good prices for this sort of things 
""
They don't get this kind of print  on material which they can
buy 
""
And uhm 
""
Now 
""
I have hung them up in my bedroom here 
""
See how the  on to the
curtains first 
""
These are not quite finished 
""
But the outline has been sketched 
""
Now what I have to do  been done
with carbon paper 
""
Now uhm 
paint it in 
""
I also get ideas for my designs  a monthly
subscription 
""
Small pamphlets with different designs in it that can be used to
""
""
And the designs are quite originals in them
""
You can draw animals  or just abstract designs
""
""
If you have a good imagination sky is the limit you can do anything
""
""
Now 
""
Here is a bag 
""
This handbag 
with fabric paints 
""
There are special types of paints we use for this kind of painting
""
""
They are camlin  they are not exactly water
colours 
""
They are called fevicraft colours  and they are available in a
wide range of colours  and you can
paint 
""
See how I have done this bag 
""
The result is 
""
Not only can you paint bags and other pieces of cloth  but you
can also paint  infact anything that you use around the house
""
""
You can paint practically anything 
""
You can paint claypots 
""
You can do all sorts of designs on clay-pots even  Egyptian
designs like the old Egyptian urns 
and uhm 
""
Then uhm 
some  on any object
""
""
They bring either 
pie  of cloth they want to make into something
or 
""
You can even paint uh 
""
You can do all sorts of designs on a bike 
""
And uhm  a fad these days with the
younger generation specially people in colleges  because they go in for
all sorts of crazy things on their bikes these days like stickers and other
things 
""
And fabric painting 
""
It stays on bike for a much longer time 
""
It doesn't come off like a sticker 
""
Not only can you do fabric painting on all these things  you
can also paint canvas shoes 
""
You will be amazed at the sort of things you can paint on canvas
shoes 
""
You can totally change the colour of plain white canvas shoes 
""
You can make them look very trendy and very fashionable 
painting almost anything on them from your relations  to all sorts of
exotic designs 
""
You can paint towels 
""
Denim jackets are another fashion these days with fabric painting
""
""
People go in for all sorts of things  written on the back of
their denim jackets
""
Here is one 
""
This one somebody gave me and told me what to write on it 
""
So I have painted it the way that person wanted 
""
I take orders sometimes  but mainly I use my own imaginations
 exactly as I feel like
""
I let my  and the results are
usually very good 
""
They are impressive 
""
And lot of people like my work  here all the things
in front of you 
""
""
""
""
I am sure  other people with good imaginations can think of
many more things from fabric paints 
""
And uhm 
""
So this is how fabric paints can be used 
""

""
Now professor Sai Prakash  more about this
""
""
""
Let us start with the first procedure  of preparing a
cleansing cream 
""
Historically 
jaily 
""
And he was one of the  famous physicians of that particular
time next only to Hippocritis 
""
His cooling ointment 
they call into a present  has the basic ingredient
""
""
And  even to this
day 
""
In chart one you have  present in a
cleansing cream  or vegetable oil as
given in part B of the chart 
""
These are the ingredients  a
simple cleansing cream 
""
And 
particular 
facial make-up etcetera from face  or other parts of the
body 
""
And  hand
cream  with this basic
formulation 
""
We have the method of preparation  in the flow diagram given
in chart two 
""
And uh  bees
wax  melted and heated upto seventy
degree 
""
Borax taken in water  and once again
heated to seventy degree so that 
""
Bees wax in mineral oil  Borax in water are at seventy degree
""
""
Borax  bees wax oil
composition slowly with continuous stirring 
""
And  stir
vigorously and allow the temperature to cool down
""
When it comes to around fifty degrees or so  uh
perfume of your choice 
""
 one has to be very selective in adding
""
""
A suitable  and then the temperature
brought down 
""
At this stage you see that 
and you get the 
""
Now the procedure is very simple and uh  we will be doing that
particular experiment now 
""
Here we have bees wax  uhm
""
""
This is done to  and this has
this has got to be 
""
Here is the mineral oil sample 
""
I am going to  the
quantities are as given in the chart 
""
This is the  and then
""
""
And uh 
take it out with the help of a glassrod 
""
After tranfering  we now take
 dissolve it in
water for 
""
And then  to seventy degrees
""
""
And I have the set up here  uh water
inside and that water is getting heated up 
""
I now transfer  bowl
""
combination 
""
Borax dissolves and  we now have to heat it to seventy degrees
""
""
Now 
thermometer with you  seventy degrees as an
approxiamate temperature when 
""
Now that the temperature has come to  we
 or
bees wax and mineral oil 
""
And I 
with uh 
""
You see a sudden change  emulsion forming
 at
seventy degrees 
""
Initially both  now we
will get a  and

You can take the 
different
