<I>
I first became interested in fabric painting when I saw it
 advertised in a magazine 
So I went out and got a whole lot of colours and uhm I
first started out by painting on pieces of pa on pieces of
uh cloth 
I took the designs from magazines from uhm cards 
and uh sometimes I just used my own free style design 
Then uhm I started uh painting 
Now this is a pillow case 
 I've done a few designs on this pillow case with fabric
paints
In the beginning I diluted it very thickly didn't use much
water
So it's come a bit crudely 
It hasn't come very well 
So uhm I decided to dilute the paint a little more 
and make the colour more refined 
Now I use all sorts of colours like blue green yellow 
violet indigo black white on black 
You can use any colour on any kind of cloth and the results
are fantastic
Now have a look at this bedsheet 
This is something I tried quite recently 
This is a mixture of all sorts of ideas 
 I've taken it's some kind of ink freaking 
You can do the same sort of thing on paper
Take a piece of string dip it in ink put it between two
pieces of paper flatten it the paper and pull it out
slowly 
Now the same idea has been applied on this bedsheet 
But the string I have taken is slightly thicker and I have
streaked the bedsheet all over and then the results that you can see
are fantastic 
It has given it a very printed kind of look and uhm very
professional 
And not only that I spray painted all over the bedsheet 
with different colours and I've used enough stensils to
mark a ki kind of outline all round
the end of the bedsheet 
So uhm the effect is quite good actually 
Now uh this was just a trial actually starting with sort of
bedsheet because bedsheets aren't very expensive 
Now here is another piece of cloth 
This is a dress material 
I have decided to go a step further and try out this kind of fabric
painting on dress material 
I have done the same sort of thing but I've used uhm
 cut out moulds 
The moulds are potatoes and ladysfingers 
These can be used as moulds for printing in different colours all
over the material and I've also spray painted the material 
and streaked it 
You can even draw your own little stars here and there and see
like this and uhm the results are quite good 
Now all that has to be done with this material is to be cut out
and sewn into a dress 
I still haven't tried making a dress out of it yet but uh 
once I do it the results are good enough I am going to start selling them
And I am sure the market is going to be quite good for this kind of
stuff because its quite original and I don't think anyone has quite
tried this sort of thing before 
You can do almost anything with fabric painting
You can paint curtains you can paint bedsheets you can
paint uhm dress-material handkerchiefs pillow covers 
table-cloths 
All sorts of things you use around the house even like uhm 
just little designs wall designs to hang on the walls and anything
else you fancy actually 
Uhm so uh fabric painting is fast becoming quite
popular especially for curtains and other things used around the house
But this is the first time I am trying fabric painting on
dresses 
People have tried it before on uh T-shirts and uhm 
other things but I am going to start something new now I am going to start
fabric painting on Jeans and other articles which haven't been
painted so far 
Now uhm this is a pair of Jeans 
The modern trend is not to wear Jeans that are flawlessly clean
But rather to be speckled with all sorts of colours and paints
and uh patches 
In other words Jeans are fashionably dirty these days 
People prefer to wear them dirty 
Now instead of making Jeans dirty I think a better idea would
be to paint the dirt on 
But not exactly paint the dirt on we would rather paint
patches on or paint little things on it or even use stensils or
potatoes and ladysfingers 
You won't believe that a pair of Jeans could be made to look like
this 
Now this looks as though it has been done in a factory
 and uh I have tried selling a few of these dress and few of this
 some of the dress-material before and uhm the prices are people
are willing to pay a fair quite good prices for this sort of things 
They don't get this kind of print on material which they can
buy which they buy in the shop 
And uhm well they are willing to pay quite well for it 
Now these are some curtains 
I have hung them up in my bedroom here 
See how the outline has been carefully sketched on to the
curtains first 
These are not quite finished 
But the outline has been sketched 
Now what I have to do is yes since it's been done
with carbon paper 
Now uhm I have to paint the outline and then 
paint it in 
I also get ideas for my designs from a monthly
subscription for a magazine they send pamphlets 
Small pamphlets with different designs in it that can be used to
 fabric painting 
And the designs are quite originals in them
You can draw animals or flowers or just abstract designs
 you can spray paint you can use strings of one word 
If you have a good imagination sky is the limit you can do anything
Now here is another thing 
Here is a bag 
This handbag is made of denim and it has been painted 
with fabric paints 
There are special types of paints we use for this kind of painting
They are camlin wat uh they are not exactly water
colours they are fevicraft 
They are called fevicraft colours and they are available in a
wide range of colours they should be diluted quite a bit and you can
paint 
See how I have done this bag 
The result is astonishing 
Not only can you paint bags and other pieces of cloth but you
can also paint vessels infact anything that you use around the house
You can paint practically anything 
You can paint claypots 
You can do all sorts of designs on clay-pots even Egyptian
designs like the old Egyptian urns Greek designs like Graceo urns 
and uhm they will make wonderful ornaments put all over the house 
Then uhm some people so 
some people just come and ask me to paint things on any object
They bring either pieces of cloths or some a 
pie a piece of cloth they want to make into something
or any sort of cloth actually plus different sorts of articles 
You can even paint uh vehicles like bikes 
You can do all sorts of designs on a bike 
And uhm this is becoming quite a fad these days with the
younger generation specially people in colleges because they go in for
all sorts of crazy things on their bikes these days like stickers and other
things 
And fabric painting happens to stay 
It stays on bike for a much longer time 
It doesn't come off like a sticker 
Not only can you do fabric painting on all these things you
can also paint canvas shoes 
You will be amazed at the sort of things you can paint on canvas
shoes 
You can totally change the colour of plain white canvas shoes 
You can make them look very trendy and very fashionable by 
painting almost anything on them from your relations to all sorts of
exotic designs 
You can paint towels skirts jackets 
Denim jackets are another fashion these days with fabric painting
People go in for all sorts of things written on the back of
their denim jackets
Here is one 
This one somebody gave me and told me what to write on it 
So I have painted it the way that person wanted 
I take orders sometimes but mainly I use my own imaginations
 and I normally do exactly as I feel like
I let my imagination run wild sometimes and the results are
usually very good 
They are impressive 
And lot of people like my work and uhm here all the things
in front of you 
 It's quite an array here and uhm it's 
 these are most of the things you can uh use fabric paints on 
I am sure other people with good imaginations can think of
many more things from fabric paints 
And uhm that's about it the fabric paints 
So this is how fabric paints can be used 
Hello there today's topic home-made
cosmetics 
Out of the fifty or more cosmetics that are available today we
have selected a few for your preparations at home 
The accent has been on easy availability and processing 
Please have your books and pens ready so that you can note
down the formulae and procedure that are going to be flashed up on to the
screen 
Follow the safety precautions to the best of your ability so
that you can get serviceable and usable material 
Many people say the use of cosmetics is a luxury 
Others are equally voceferous that it is important for
personality development and en enhancement 
 
We leave it to you to decide 
But have your books and pens ready and for your
information cosmetics is derived from the Greek word cosmeticos
 meaning skill in decorating 
Another meaning for the word cosmos is ornament 
And as you know cosmos also means the whole universe
So the supporters of cosmetics say that the scope is wide
ranging and far reaching 
Now professor Sai Prakash will tell you more about this
Let us start with the first procedure of preparing a
cleansing cream 
Historically one of the earliest creams was prepared by 
jaily around the year one thirty-two hundred A D 
And he was one of the famous physicians of that particular
time next only to Hippocritis 
His cooling ointment called Serateem refrigeran 
they call into a present cleansing cream has the basic ingredient
 bees wax olive olive oil rose water etcetera 
And the combination of this cleansing cream even to this
day is almost similar 
In chart one you have the basic ingredients present in a
cleansing cream like bees wax mineral oil or vegetable oil as
given in part B of the chart water and borax 
These are the ingredients with which you can prepare uh a
simple cleansing cream at home 
And the purpose of this pa 
particular cleansing cream is to remove oil grime 
facial make-up etcetera from face or throat or other parts of the
body 
And other creams such as uh vanishing cream hand
cream or one word creams are prepared with this basic
formulation 
We have the method of preparation in the flow diagram given
in chart two 
And uh in the chart you see that we have uh bees
wax and mineral oil taken together melted and heated upto seventy
degree so that the wax melts and we have a homogeneous solution 
Borax taken in water dissolved in water and once again
heated to seventy degree so that both these reacting 
Bees wax in mineral oil Borax in water are at seventy degree
 and they are mixed up slowly 
Borax in water being added to this bees wax oil
composition slowly with continuous stirring 
And when all the ingredient has been added you stir
vigorously and allow the temperature to cool down
When it comes to around fifty degrees or so you add uh uh
perfume of your choice 
 It's because one has to be very selective in adding
 perfume because the choice varies from person to person 
A suitable perfume can be added and then the temperature
brought down further 
At this stage you see that the whole thing emulsifies 
and you get the cold or one word cream of your choice 
Now the procedure is very simple and uh we will be doing that
particular experiment now 
Here we have bees wax it is made into small chips uhm
 when it is marketed it's of this particular shape 
This is done to see that it melts easily and this has
this has got to be dissolved in mineral oil 
Here is the mineral oil sample 
I am going to pour this into a beaker and uh the
quantities are as given in the chart the same poportion being taken 
This is the mineral oil transfered into a beaker and then
 the beas wax is crushed into this utensil 
And uh we have a set up of uh I'll 
take it out with the help of a glassrod 
After tranfering bees wax into mineral oil we now take
 borax and dissolve it in the wa dissolve it in
water for according to the quantities given 
And then heat these two ingredients to seventy degrees
And I have the set up here the heater and then uh water
inside and that water is getting heated up 
I now transfer this beaker into the water bowl
 arrangement I have made and also the borax water 
combination 
Borax dissolves and we now have to heat it to seventy degrees
Now if you are doing it at home and if you don't have 
thermometer with you you can as well take seventy degrees as an
approxiamate temperature when vapours just start coming out 
Now that the temperature has come to seventy degrees we
 remove these to and I place at top bees wax borax or
bees wax and mineral oil combination 
And I start adding borax water mixture slowly 
with uh continuous stirring 
You see a sudden change and a sort of a emulsion forming
 and this is done under hot conditions both of them at
seventy degrees 
Initially both these solutions were colourless now we
will get a beautiful cream and I add the whole thing and
 stirr it vigorously 
You can take the one word surely it's 
different beautiful cream that is prepared
