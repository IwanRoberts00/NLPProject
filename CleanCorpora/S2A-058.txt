I first became interested in fabric painting when I saw  it
""
""
So I went out and got a whole lot of colours  I
""
uh 
""
""
and uh 
""
Then uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are fantastic
""
""
""
""
""
This is a mixture of all sorts of 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But the  and I have
""
are fantastic 
""
It has given it a very printed kind of look  very
professional 
""
""
with different colours  to
mark a  of outline all round
the end of the bedsheet 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now here is another piece of cloth 
""
This is a dress material 
""
""
painting on dress material 
""
I have done the same sort of thing but  uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
and streaked it 
""
""
like this 
""
""
and sewn into a dress 
""
""
once I do it the results are good enough I am going to start selling them
""
""
And I am sure the market is going to be quite good for this kind of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""

are willing to pay a fair quite good prices for this sort of things 
""
""
buy 
""
And uhm 
""
Now 
""
""
""
