Okay today we are going to do the topic Cell
Specialisation that is how cells are specialised to form
tissues 
So far we have learnt all about mi uh unicellular
organisms 
Okay
How a single plant looks plant cell looks 
 like ?
How a single animal cell looks like ?
What all it contains ?
What are the organisms within a cell ?
Also now we have to study how many cells are arranged
together or when they are grouped together what do they form ?
What is the form of cell organization ?
Please raise your hands 
A collection of cells 
Forms ?
Tissues
Tissues 
So this is what we are going to study a collection of cells 
forms a particular tissue and why are the cells organized together to
form the tissues ?
 It's because they have to carry out a specific
function 
So far you have seen that one single cell carry carries out all the
activity 
Now when a group of cells get get together they will carry out
 the same activity but at a larger level
At the more quicker rate of doing it 
One cell and ten cells doing the work 
It is just like one person doing one work and ten
persons doing the same amount of work 
Which will get over faster ?
 Ten persons 
 Ten persons doing the amount of work
So the specialisation of cell to form a tissue is to carry
out a work and this is mainly found up in higher animals and plants 
Now the definition of the tissue is a group of cells
 specialised for a particular function 
Okay
A group of cells specialised for a particular function to
perform may be absorption of water in the plants or to perform uh
energy uh energy production 
Okay that is work in plants and animals 
Or like chlorophyll production in plants or the enzyme
production in animals 
So for a typical function in the cells are grouped together a
set of cells are known as tissues 
Today we are going to study about the types of, plant tissues
as well as animal tissues 
The plants and animals are totally different from each other
Both of them are basically living organisms 
But what is that one one feature which distinguishes plants
and animals ?
Plants prepare their own food 
And animals do not prepare their own food ?
They take it from others from the plants
What is it present in the plant cell ?
Chlorophyll 
The presence of chlorophyll
What is chlorophyll ?
Green colour 
Green colouring matter
Green colouring matter 
What does this green colouring matter do ?
What ability does it have ?
Yes ?
It gives the green colour to plant
No 
It is brown 
No
Yes uh anybody ?
It absorbs the heat of the sun
It is the only substance from which the plant which has the
ability to absorb the sun's rays 
Do you understand any animals which can absorb the sun's 
light and prepare their own energy ?
No no
So the green chlorophyll that is uh the green colouring
matter the green pigment within the cell of a plant has the ability
to absorb out the sun's rays and convert it uh use it for
the preparation of starch that is the basic food material of plant 
Now what are the plant tissues ?
Plant tissues are of two types one is 
meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue 
 Meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue
 
For example ?
And the second is ?
Permanent tissues 
Now meristematic tissues are usually found at the tip
where tips of the plants where active growth is taking place 
Like the tip of the root the tip of the shoot that is
when leaves are being produced or the bud that the bud is going to
give rise to a plant or the lateral graticules which you are going to
give direct to the animal plant cell and leaves etcetra or the auxillary
bud 
What does the auxillary bud forms ?
Uh auxillary bud is the thing which will give rise to leaves
etcetra 
Now meristematic tissues are uh those cells which are found at
the tips of actively growing parts of the plant 
These cells are polygonal in shape and it has a centrally
 placed large nucleus a very dense cytoplasm and they do not have
any vacuoles in them
No air pins are present and there are no intercellular spaces
within these meristematic tissues okay
And these tissues are contrary devices they form in larger size and
give rise to a new set of cell 
And the main function is to form new tissues for the plants 
Then you have the second set of plant uh the second set of
tissues sorry and that is the permanent tissues 
 Permanent tissues 
Now in the permanent tissues you have again two types as
Simple permanent
Simple permanent and
 Complex tissues 
 Complex tissues 
Okay 
The simple permanent tissues are they are not uh very
complex in their structure and also their functions are not very high
That is they do not have to perform extremly vital
functions for the plant 
Vital means those functions which are vital for the life of
the plant
So the uh to see that the plant keeps alive 
Okay 
These types of tissues will perform certain functions and the vital
functions are the permanent permanent tissues
And the simple tissues the simple form of permanent tissues
are the one which form a support adding support for the plant or which
forms the main structure of the stem or the root or the leaves 
And it provides support mechanical support to the plant and to
some extent they also help in preparing food for the plant 
Okay you have learnt about plastid in our previous chapter 
Then we have learnt Plastid as the starch 
One is the 
 Chlor Chloroplast 
Please raise your hands 
Girls Durga ?
Chloroplast
Yes
 Chloroplast chrmoplast and one word 
 Chloroplast chrmoplast and one word 
Now chloroplast is the one that absorbs the sunlight 
Chromoplast gives colour colour to the plant other
than these and it use of flower is very important one with
starch present in the flower 
 Colour 
So the simple permanent tissues some of them I mean the
leaf or flower and as well found in the preparation of starch one word
The preparing of the one word now suppose if you put
simple permanent tissues in the two words 
There is no simple permanent tissues when the name of five a
few words and these which help out in the preparation of starch
Okay now which are the type of simple permanent tissues we
have to see 
The first one is parenchyma the second is 
collenchyma collenchyma and the third and the third is
 sclerenchyma 
 Collenchyma 
 And the third is 
 Sclernchyma 
We are learning what is it ?
 Noise 
Okay now out of these simple permanent tissues 
the most simple structure is of a parenchyma cell
These are usually green in colour they are spherical 
root in cell there are lot of intercellular spaces in between them 
They have a large nucleus and many vacuoles around
along the thin cyctoplasm plus the other cell uh cellular orgnelles
are present 
And they are filled with a number of plastids 
These plastids help in the preparation of food 
The parenchyma cells that is revived they are circular in
shape loosely spaced having a lot of inter-cellular spaces 
The cell walls are thin and they have a large nucleus which
push to one side by the secondary based vacoule plus the plastids are
present in large number in the case of parenchyma cells 
Plastids are not are present in the leaves and the 
cells
And if you have to release the very green in colour in the
presence of the green colour plant 
Then we have a second okay the function of the parenchyma
is preparation of food 
The second type of cells are the collenchyma cells 
These have got a very definite structure and they
provide mechanical strength to the whole plant 
There is a charact characteristic
 thing about the collenchyma is that they are a firm
thickening at the corners of the four corners of the cell 
This is one of the characteristic features of the collenchyma
cells that is the cell corners show thickening of a specific substance
The thickening is made up of cellulose plus pectine 
Okay 
These are substances which are found uh mainly in plant uh
plant bodies rather than animal cells 
Do you know that the cell wall in in plant is made up of
cellulose which you studied in your lower classes 
Okay but uh collenchyma cells are made up of uh additional
substance called pectine which gives it more strength or which makes it more
tougher than the normal other cells 
Even though parenchyma cells contain cellulose in their cell
walls yet uh which gives it a definite shape around the around
the structure 
But uh collenchyma cells are I told you they provide
mechanical support to the plants and for this sake they have to contain a
certain hard structure in their cell body 
And this is made by a combination of cellulose plus pectine
and this is fo found in the presence of
in the form of cell thickenings at the corners of the cell 
Also then the rest of the structures are there like the vacuole or
 nucleus the other chloroplasts and the cytoplasm 
So remember collenchyma provide mechanical support to the plant
body 
They are mostly present in the outer layers of a structure like
 the periphery of the leaf uh of the cross section of the leaf or 
the borders of the stem 
Okay the outer walls of the stem to give that thickness to the
stem or the outer walls of the root are all made up of collenchyma cells
and it gives that stiffness to the plant 
Do you understand ?
Now the last type of permanent permanent tissues uh sorry
simple permanent tissues is the sclerenchyma cells 
These are single shaped cells and as it is growing
or as it is maturing what happens is the central part of the cell 
starts moving in cytoplasm 
And in fact the part gets tougher after sometime and it it
becomes very hard and tough 
And the collection of sclerenchyma forms uh structure
called as one word 
What do they form ?
 One word 
 One word 
Okay this is the one word formed in the
sclerenchyma cells start moving and start moving moving out in the inner
part of the cytoplasm
And what what is important is that the sclerenchyma 
gives out the important fibres that we obtain today in the form of jute and
uh from the jute plant and the hemp plant okay 
So these fibres which we use for making sack or for making
even now a days uh jute cloth is attaining a lot of importance 
All these can be obtained from our sclerenchyma fibres which
on maturing have got certain stone cells or one word and
these stone cells give a toughness to the cell and they end up 
becoming the fibres of the plant 
Thus the sclerenchyma cells are found in large numbers in certain
type of plants like the coconut 
The coconut palm then you have your jute uh tree or your
hemp etcetra where fibres are obtained from these plants
I shall tell you about these again we use for variety of uh 
provisions like making of rope of choirs or even matresses coir
matresses or then the latest is jute cloth 
So this completes our uh one topic that is simple
permanent tissues 
These tissues have not uh have not totally lost their
ability to divide
That is if we want we can bunch their form they can still
undergo cellular division and form new set of cells
This is what distinguishes simple permanent tissues from
complex permanent tissues
They have not totally lost their ability to divide that means 
when the cell is formed it grows in size but also it has a necessity 
it can also divide and form another set of cells 
What we have learnt is that only meristematic cells are capable of
function cell doesn't it ?
But in certain cases usually simple permanent cells can undergo
 uh cell division if the need arises though not always 
Then you have a large size of cell plant
cells and that is the complex permanent tissues 
These are the most important tissues of the plant because they
perform the very vital functions like conducting of water and
conducting of food materials 
This cell the complex uh permanent tissue which 
conduct water are known as your xylem cells 
 Xylem cells 
And the permanent permanent tissues which conduct food
materials are known as your phloem cells 
 Phloem cells 
These are found in the innermost regions of the plant or 
of the plant structure like the stem the root or the leaf of the tree 
The inner most structure of these is form of these root
structure the Xylem and the phloem 
Why are they called as complex permanent tissues is because 
the word complex is a very key word 
If these cells once they are formed once a particular cell is
formed it loses its ability to divide
It can not divide again and form another xylem cell 
It remains by itself and it goes on performing its function
and after a period of time when it has finished its uh life life
cycle life period it might die off
Then a new xylem cell might come in its place 
But this cell on its own will not give rise to a new set of cells
Now both these uh cells that is xylem and phloem are found
in the form of tube towards the whole length of the stem or the
whole length of the root or the whole length of the leaf 
They are perfectly arranged in such a way to form a tubular
structure or tube like structure so that conduction of the material
becomes much easier
But even may be in the form of water based minerals or it
might be food materials in the case of phloem 
Okay xylem conduct water through out the plant body 
and phloem conduct waste food material towards the plant body 
Now if you want to see the individual structure of xylem and
phloem 
The xylem has got you have two sets of cells again in the
xylem and they are called as tracheids and vessels 
Okay so you have xylem tracheae and xylem vessels and
both these are found in association with each other
You will never find only a xylem tracheae or you will never find
only a xylem vessel 
And in the phloem you have two types of cells you have 
sieve and companion cells 
And one characteristic feature of the phloem cells is that at
the top walls okay the top walls are not continous but they have
got fine pores in them to form a mess like structure or matting like
structure in between the two top walls the top wall structure in between two
cell 
And this fine mess like structure acts as a sieving place for
all the materials food materials that passes along the wall 
So only a certain type of food material can pass pass through the
phloem tubes having a definite size 
All the larger materials will not pass through the sieve 
The food material can be easily accumulated by the rest uh 
the leaf of the plant through the one word of plant
