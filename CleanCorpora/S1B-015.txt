Okay today we are going to do the topic  Cell
""
""
""
""
organisms 
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Please raise your hands 
""
""
A collection of cells 
""
""
Forms  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this is what we are going to study 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is just like  and ten
""
""
Which will get over faster  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  to form a tissue is to carry
out a work and this is mainly found up in 
""
Now the definition of the tissue is  a group of cells
""
""
Okay
""
A group of cells  to
perform may be absorption of water  uh
""
""
""
""
""
production in animals 
""
""
set of cells are known as 
""
""
as well as animal tissues 
""
""
""
""
""
But what is that one  one feature which distinguishes plants
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Chlorophyll 
""
""
The presence of  chlorophyll
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What does this green colouring matter do ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No
""
Yes uh anybody  ?
""
""
It absorbs the heat of the sun
""
""
""
ability to absorb the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So the green chlorophyll that is uh  the green colouring
""
to absorb out the  use it for
""
""
""
""
""
meristematic tissue 
""
""
 Meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Permanent tissues 
""
""
""
""
""
""
when leaves are being produced  the bud is going to
""
""
bud 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
any  vacuoles in them
""
""
""
""
""
give rise to a new set of cell 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is  perform extremly vital
functions for the plant 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
These types of tissues will perform certain functions and the vital
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
some extent they also help in preparing food for the plant 
""
Okay you have learnt about plastid 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now chloroplast is the one that absorbs the sunlight 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So the simple permanent tissues  some of them I mean the
leaf or flower and as well found in the preparation of starch  one word
""
""
""
simple permanent tissues in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
presence of the green colour plant 
""
Then we have  okay the function of the parenchyma
""
""
""
""
These have got  they
""
""
There is a  characteristic
""
""
""
This is  one of the characteristic features of the collenchyma
""
""
""
The thickening is made up of 
""
Okay 
""
These are substances which are found  uh
""
""
""
cellulose which you studied in your lower classes 
""
""
substance called pectine which gives it more strength or which makes it more
tougher than the normal other cells 
""
""
walls  around
""
""
""
""
certain hard structure in their cell body 
""
""
and this is  in the presence of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
stem or the outer walls of the root are all made up of  collenchyma cells
""
""
""
""
""
simple permanent tissues 
""
""
or as it is maturing 
""
""
And in fact the part gets tougher after sometime  it
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
part of the cytoplasm
""
""
gives out the important fibres that we obtain today in the form of jute and
uh 
""
""
even now a days uh jute cloth is attaining a lot of importance 
""
""
on maturing  and
""
""
""
""
type of plants like the coconut 
""
""
""
""
""
""
matresses or then 
""
So this completes our  simple
""
""
These tissues have not  their
ability to  divide
""
That is if we want  they can still
undergo cellular division and form new set of cells
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But in certain cases usually simple permanent cells can undergo
""
""
Then you have  plant
cells 
""
These are the most important tissues of the plant because they
perform  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the permanent permanent tissues which conduct food
""
""
""
""
""
""
These are found in the innermost regions of the plant or 
""
""
""
""
""
Why are they called as complex permanent tissues is because 
""
""
If these cells once they are formed  once a particular cell is
""
""
It can not divide again and form another xylem cell 
""
It remains by itself  and it goes on performing its function
and after a period of time  life
""
""
Then a new xylem cell might come in its place 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
structure or tube like structure so that  conduction of the material
becomes much easier
""
""
might be 
""
""
and phloem conduct waste food material 
""
""
phloem 
""
""
xylem and they are called as 
""
""
both these are found  in association with each other
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And one characteristic feature of the phloem cells is that  at
the top walls  but they have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
phloem tubes having a definite size 
""
""
""
The food material can be easily accumulated by the 
the leaf of the plant through the
