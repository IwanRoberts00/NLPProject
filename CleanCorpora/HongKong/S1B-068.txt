which are relevant to this trail happened on the twentieth of november 
right cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
when was the first time you realised that that date that
we ' re you are talking about was actually the twentieth of november 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
you mean cantonese answer 
 
i ' m confused
are you talking about the last day uh i stayed in the hotel that
is when i checked out or the day of the robbery 
 well 
ms ng you all you told us was that you saw people counting money
and you saw people dividing money on that day right
 
 did you hear cantonese translation
and answer 
 
 yes 
 right 
there was no indication that the robbery occurred on th 
that day right
 
 and 
 but you confirmed cantonese translation 
right cantonese answer and translation 
 
something had indicate that at half past twelve pm that day hau
chuen sum phoned me up
hau told me on the telephone that there were the three of them and
as for the other two he did not know whether they could run away 
i see
so you came to conclusion that then they had been engaged in a
robbery that day am i right ' am i right ' overlap ' gam yo yi ' - ' that is
why ' cantonese translation and answer 
am i right ' am i right ' overlap witness ' s answer ' ngh
haih ' - ' no ' 
 
is it not cantonese answer 
 
it ' s not an con an conclusion from deduction
in fact before that cantonese translation and answer 
 
in ah cheung ' s home i sensed something uh i sensed that there was
something suspicious 
in any event you deduced from everything that happened before
that day and the thing that happened on back to the day that there was the
day of robbery am i right cantonese translation and answer 
 
i did not deduce anything from anything 
very well
ms ng now all you have been shown was a hotel record stating
that the last day that you stayed there was the ninth of november 
cantonese translation 
right ' right ' overlaps ' nah ' - ' well just now ' 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
now and yet you were able to tell the jury in no uncertain
terms that the last time that you visited defendant ' s residence was on the
nineteenth cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes cantonese answer 
<$z2 
it ' s a thursday 
because the nineteen was a thursday and that ' s why you
decided that it was the nineteenth am i right cantonese translation and
answer 
 
no 
was there any other reason why you were so certain that it was
the nineteenth cantonese translation and answer 
 
on on the night of the nineteenth when i left the three of them
were talking cantonese answer and translation 
 
and they were watching a cantonese movie cantonese answer
 
which was about a rape
however the three of them were all looking at me 
cantonese answer 
 
so i was very frightened cantonese and answer 
 
and on the nineteenth after the three knives were purchased and
brought there i became even more frightened cantonese answer 
 
at first my impression of the event on that day was not so deep
but after they had done so i became very uh frightened and was in a panic
so because you are in a panic you remember that was a
nineteenth so to speak ' so to speak ' overlap ' gam ' - ' so ' 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
and therefore the following day must be the twentieth am i
right cantonese translation and answer 
 
uh his phoned call at about twelve thirty woke me up from my sleep
and it was the twentieth 
so am i right to say that uhm the fact that you remember that
was a nineteenth of november was because you were in a panic on the
nineteenth of november while you were still inside the defendant ' s residence
 cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
and there had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that
hotel records were shown to you this morning by my learned friend counsel for
the crown cantonese translation and answer 
 
correct 
right
and presumably when you were first interviewed by the police on the
sixth of january last year the nineteenth of november that date was still
deeply implanted in your mind am i right cantonese translation and answer
 
correct 
and you would know that it was the nineteenth of november that
you were put to fear by three men in the defendant ' s flat cantonese
translation and answer 
 
correct 
and you will have no difficulty in the recalling that it was a
following day uh which must be the twentieth of november that all these
things about counting of money and dividing of money took place right 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
correct

when i gave statements on that day i was very tired 
cantonese answer 
 
i had been in the police station for over twenty four house so i
was very much confused 
isn't it right that in this statement of yours there was not
a single mention of the fact that you spent any time at all in the defendant ' s
residence after you left conrad hotel cantonese translation and answer
 
i should have mentioned it
i must have 
what you went on to describe was that uh he once came to your
house in early november and you saw him take out a pistol and put it into a
drawer am i right cantonese translation and answer 
 
but i had given many statements not just this one
in some of the statements i was telling events uh before
that 
 i will ms ng i shall come to deal with your
other many statements in due course
please concentrate on this statement in front of you cantonese
translation 
you agree with me that what you went on to say well according
to this statement was that uhm there was one occasion when mr hau turned up
in your house in early november and put the pistol into a drawer 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
well according to you uh that is according to your testimony
earlier this afternoon that didn't happen did it cantonese
translation and answer 
 
but no one asked me whether the pistol was kept at my home 
because you said this afternoon that first occasion that you
saw mr hau producing a pistol-like object was when he was in the
defendant flat right ' right ' overlaps ' yan wai ' - ' this is because ' 
 cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
and according to you the first time that you went to
defendant flat would be on the tenth of november right cantonese
translation and answer 
 
 yes 
 uhm 
and according to you hau stayed in the defendant flat until the
twentieth of november right cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
and you say that after the twentieth november you saw him
carried the gun or the pistol everywhere he went right cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes 
and i ask you specifically a question as to whether there
were other occasions or other places where you saw a gun or gun-like object
was produced by mr hau remember cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes i remember 
and your answer was yes after after the incident was occurred
on the twentieth of november he carried the gun every minute cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes i did say that 
so what about this occasion in early november ninety two when
he produced a pistol-like object and put it in your drawer
did it occur or didn't occur cantonese translation and answer
 
yes it did 
in early november nineteen ninety two according to your
testimony you and mr hau were hiding in hotel am i right ' am i right'
overlap ' gan geui - ' according to ' cantonese translation and answer
 
yes 
so it couldn't have been in the early part of november that
this incident occurred am i right cantonese translation and answer 
 
it may not be right cantonese answer 
 
i only stayed in hotels with him from the first of november to
the ninth of november ninety two 
but according to you tried to stay at conrad you spent
three days at two different hotel in the latter part of october right 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes round about 
and according to you after you said hau left conrad he went
straight to the defendant flat ' and ' overlaps ' sahp ngh ' -'the
fifteenth ' cantonese translation 
 and to right after the currents of what happened
on the twentieth of november
 
 uh cantonese translation and answer 
 
you mean after he left the hotel 
well according to your story yes cantonese translation
and answer 
 
yes 
so this occasion in early november nineteen ninety two could
not have happened cantonese translation 
right cantonese translation and answer 
 
why could not 
because mr hau did not go to your flat did he cantonese
translation and answer 
 
i did mentioned about what happened after we checked out of
conrad although not in this statement but in another statement 
ms ng what you told the police on the sixth of january was
that uhm jumping from what happened in early november you told the police
what happened in late november right cantonese translation and answer
 
i ' ve already told you i ' m not a computer

would you be patient when answering my question ' would
you be patient when answering my question ' overlap witness ' s answer ' kam
ngoh dong sih haih ging ' - ' but i was frightened at that moment ' and unclear
court interpreter ' s translation cantonese translation and answer
 
but at that time i was very frightened 
yes ms ng would you kindly answer my question
am i right to say that on the sixth of january while you were
giving a statement to the police you did not tell the police what happened in
for example late november cantonese translation and answer 
 
i did 
but you briefed me that it was not contained in the statement
in front of you cantonese translation and answer 
 
correct 
and what was said in that statement was after you described
what happened in early november when you say mr hau produced a pistol and put
in your drawer you went out to tell the police what happened in the late
november right cantonese translation and answer 
 
i have already told you i ' m very confused cantonese
answer 
 
and i did not know what was going on
no one told me what was going and those officers were very busy
ms ng i would be very grateful to you if you would deal with
my question first then you have ample opportunity to tell your
explanation later cantonese translation and answer 
 
please don't trap me for that event
you have asked me three times already
you have confused me
i can't give you an answer 
the answer is a simple one ms ng
reply yes or no cantonese translation and answer 
 
according to this piece of paper that is the case that paragraph
is uh was not added there so should i give you an answer or not give you 
ms ng so you have written that in this statement the late
entry of event was what happened in late november cantonese translation
and answer 
 
that is correct according to this piece of paper 
uhm thank you
