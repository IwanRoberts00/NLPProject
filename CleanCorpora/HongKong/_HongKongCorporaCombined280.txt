let me first tell you about a trivial incident the other day i took a cab home from work the driver reminded me to put on my seat-belt and i thanked him this was a rational conversation he did not assume that i would take it as an insult i did not think he was questioning my knowledge of the law or my intention to comply with it i know you expect me to discuss serious issues like the public order ordinance perhaps or the rule of law or democracy well in fact i am talking about all of these and about political leadership and the free press into the bargain because i want to tell you what i have been thinking about on rational debate which underlies them all whatever is happening to rational debate everyone agrees it is fast disappearing in hong kong even mrs regina ip has recently told us that but for her motion in legco there would not have been any rational debate on the poo now we would all agree that it is important for the community to have a habit of rational debate whatever our creed or political inclination we are united in our abhorrence of violence and tyranny we have seen enough of violence in recent world history to be totally appalled and tyranny and violence go hand in hand the prevention of violence and tyranny must be the most pressing aim of politics in all civilized societies now all this is familiar to us i have just finished reading the intellectual autobiography of my teacher professor joseph agassi in it he discussed the contribution to political thinking of his teacher sir karl popper the author of the open society and its enemies i was very struck by the simplicity of what he said for example democracy is defined as any regime in which the governed are able to overthrow those who govern them without bloodshed or revolution so the fundamental appeal of democracy is it renders violence unnecessary agassi says popper ' s book is not a direct defense of democracy but of the open society democracy is defended as the political tool most likely to achieve the desired end of keeping society increasingly open so that its members are increasingly free you may recall that popper is the philosopher who makes fallibility not infallibility the central and distinguishing character of science agassi adds on to popper by tackling the practical question of political leadership everyone is interested in finding the right leaders and setting out what should be their tasks we may never know for sure of finding the right leaders whether by democratic or by other means but democracy allows a community to correct its mistakes and learn from them in the least costly and most promising way it is better to replace the wrong leader than to be stuck with one democracy is about the control of the leadership by the led this is a very important message for me hong kong has no system as yet to elect its government so in hong kong is not possible as yet to have democratic exercise of executive power but even in hong kong even under the present system we can achieve a high degree of democratic control of power and this would go some way towards the elimination of violence and tyranny this should be our political agenda and agassi said this which i like very much without an alternative he said the only solution no matter how bad wins one task of a responsible leadership is to notice the absence of a contingency plan or the poverty of the existing contingency plans and to cater for the development of one and this requires discussion and discussion requires political parties and a parliament with a legitimate opposition and a national consensus and caucuses and lobbies and more i suppose a free press and lively critical commentators taking the meaning of nation as broad enough to cover the hong kong sar under the one country two systems principle this view too is applicable to hong kong this shows how the different components of our political structure can work together through rational debate towards a society which is stable and free from violence and threats of disintegration a democratic system allows the participation of the greatest number of people since apart from the minimum civic duty of obeying the law political responsibility is all voluntary different individuals and groups can take on greater or smaller responsibilities some may take on responsibilities only occasionally and on specific issues but the par participation of maximum number of people and groups of people each acting autonomously does not have to result in the chaos that some people fear it so happens that hong kong together with the rest of the world has just witnessed a powerful demonstration of democracy working in the most dramatic of american presidential elections consider the extreme vigorous contests the highly visible divisions the pangs and the headaches yes i hear you laugh but mark this the rules operated in their normal way produced the resolution and in one moment the integrity of the american nation re- emerged brought together again by the speech of the loser conceding victory to his opponent  to borrow a phrase the golden thread that runs through all this is rational debate you see i ' m almost done a debate presupposes a question and at least two views which are critical of one another you can have a debate without a conclusion but you cannot have a debate without at least two views to the same question which are critical of one another in other words where democracy is the agreed mode criticism and genuine disagreement is indispensable and this fact is as crucial to the government as to the opposition we have to understand that criticism is not necessitated by bad government criticism is necessary to rational debate and to democracy itself so the government never need to take criticism as an implied insult or inchoate indictment likewise the government ' s critics never need to couple even the strongest criticism with hostility we don't have to despise the government to criticize it on the contrary without respect criticism is impossible we can only turn our back on what we despise i suspect it is this mistaken view of criticism which is pushing rational debate towards its extinction terms like confrontation indicate such a mistaken view it really identifies criticism with hatred and contempt equally endangering is the view that any criticism must aim at undermining the authority of the party criticized when a government insists on the unquestioned acceptance of its authority and therefore tries to stifle criticism in the name of stability and control then room for rational debate quickly disappears it is when there is no room for rational debate that conscientious people will have to resort to means such as civil disobedience and that quickly brings us to the brink of violence because a government which cannot tolerate criticism will tolerate civil disobedience even less so we all have a stake in promoting rational debate and that begins with the appreciation of critical speech and thinking  dear carol legco ' s session has just come to an end the debate on the chief executive election bill took ten hours and as you know on the most controversial clause involving the ce ' s removal by the central people ' s government the government ' s proposal carried we now have in our statute books an astonishing provision the effect is that apart from the expiry of his term or upon his death hong kong can only declare a vacancy and hold an election for his successor if the central people ' s government gives the go ahead it does not matter if the ce has resigned or disappeared without trace or has fallen into a permanent coma so long as beijing has not gone through the motion of removing him the sar will not be able to declare a vacancy as a matter of law conversely if cpg removes a chief executive from office then hong kong sar must declare a vacancy and hold an election unless the government is prepared to maintain that the removal is contrary to the basic law now how likely do you think that this is going to be the amendment proposed by audrey eu and i was defeated we were at a loss why the government would oppose us for ours was a perfectly simple and neutral proposal it does not raise the question of the power of cpg to remove the ce at all so it cannot be said that it was too wide or too restricted as represented in our law we simply say that the function of the clause is to provide that when the ce ' s office has become vacant then an election must be held we then provide for two situations the anticipated vacancy upon the expiry of a term and the unan anticipated vacancy arising before the term expires this is because the election arrangements are slightly different in each case but that ' s all you need for the purpose of the bill we made this proposal because we thought it was wholly unnecessary to get embroiled in the sensitive issue of the power of cpg particularly when the government has embarked on a course which denies hong kong ' s autonomy under the basic law the bar and the law society were unanimous in pointing out that the government ' s understanding on cpg ' s power to remove the ce was wrong professor albert chen who ' s a dean of hku law school and a member of the basic law committee wrote to the secretary for justice to tell her that the government ' s approach was wrong and our proposal was sound and no one can ever accuse professor chen of being disrespectful of the basic law even michael suen secretary for constitutional affairs admitted in the debate that our approach was right why then did he for the government oppose it  his answer was this our amendment he said does not make it clear beyond doubt when the ce ' s office has become vacant so that there is uncertainty leading to delay and confusion but we said and another member andrew wong explained with great patience vacancy is a matter of fact whether the ce ' s office has become vacant or not is a question of fact most of the time it would be quite plain and obvious other times it may be less straightforward but the determination of questions of fact is very much part of normal life other governments in the world have no problem telling that the office of their head has or has not become vacant the hong kong sar government seems to be the only one who finds this difficult yet as michael suen was speaking i saw the light the real difference between our proposal and his is that according to our amendment the hong kong sar determines as a matter of fact whether the ce ' s office has become wac vacant in the government ' s amendment this is decided by the central people ' s government by an exercise of its authority i must admit i was dumbfounded if in taking this position the government was acting on beijing ' s instruction hong kong ' s autonomy would be only an illusion if the government was acting on its own the clear message to us or to beijing is that it does not want to take any responsibility for making a decision or any risk of giving the impression that hong kong is acting too independently or trespassing on beijing ' s prerogative the government will wait to be told a government which can think like this is despicable indeed you see it is the business of governments to take responsibility so it is the business of legco the legislature of a hong kong sar to take responsibility so each of its members must take responsibility to vet bills to reduce error and to make improvements where we can and to insist on upholding what is right and in the public interest even if we are doomed to fail i was asked by a reporter whether i didn't think i was too narrowly confining my interest to legal issues and to the rule of law and whether i shouldn't take greater interest in what concerns ordinary people but to me law concerns vast numbers of ordinary people in the most direct and even drastic ways for example when a criminal offense is given too wide a definition numerous innocent people may be caught when you persuade the government to target illegal bookmakers rather than making a criminal of everyone who places a bet with him you are trying to save ordinary people as well as our system of criminal law from abuse when laws are bad people suffer this can happen with bad gambling law as well as bad copyright law or law regulating investment and commercial activities we need good laws to protect rights whether these be labour rights or consumer rights or rights against a violent spouse or against racial discrimination it is our responsibility as lawyers or lawmakers to make the law serve the people this also means making the law clearer and more user-friendly so that it makes sense to ordinary people at least in most of the areas in which they are most directly affected we have a long way to go and so far the battle has been uphill so i shall be glad of the summer break in the penultimate motion debate of the session martin lee had chosen an ecumenical motion if i may put it that way on the elements of a world class city many members spoke of the importance of the rule of law i thought this was an apt occasion to sum up as it were my experience of the session and i spoke of the respect for reasoning in the tradition of the rule of law geoffrey robertson queens counsel who was in hong kong recently to represent the right of abode seekers in the court of final appeal explained in his book the justice game why he liked his life as an advocate because he says in the justice game the rules ensure that the side with the best argument wins when the side with the best argument wins people will seek out reason and evidence when power wins every time and reason is defeated constantly the rule of law will not for long endure your worn-out friend margaret ng
