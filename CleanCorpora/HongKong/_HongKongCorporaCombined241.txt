members of the jury you would realise the main question to be decided in this case is whether or not the defendant chan wai ping was the robber in each of these thirteen robberies  the subject matter of these thirteen charges before you  it is my job to tell you what the law is and how to apply it to the issues of fact that you have to decide and to remind you of the important evidence on both issues  as to the law you must accept what i tell you  as to the facts you alone are the judges  it is for you to decide what evidence you accept and what evidence  you reject or of which you are unsure  if i appear to have a view of the evidence or of the facts with which you do not agree reject my view  if i mention or emphasize evidence that you regard as unimportant  disregard that evidence  if i do do not mention evidence that you regard as important follow your own view and take the evidence and take that evidence into account  you must decide the case only on the evidence that you have heard not on speculation about what evidence there might have been  there will be no more  in the case of each witness consider whether he or she has been telling you the truth and whether he or she has been accurate in the account given  in the case of each witness you may accept or reject all or some of what he or she has told you  when you have decided what evidence you are sure is correct it is for you to decide what conclusions you are sure you should draw from it  the prosecution must prove the defendant ' s guilt  he does not have to prove his innocence  before you can convict the defendant you must be sure of his guilt  that is the same thing as being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt  if you have any doubt as to the defendant ' s guilt you must give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant  you must consider the case against and for the defendant on each count separately and individually  this is particularly so in this case where the defendant is charged with thirteen counts of robbery  you cannot i repeat you cannot draw any inference from another count for the count you are considering in order to come to a certain conclusion  that is to say if you find him guilty of one robbery you cannot find him guilty of another robbery just because he is guilty of the former one  let me emphasise emphasise once more that the case for and against against and for the defendant on each count must be considered individually and separately  in this case there are thirteen counts of robberies in the indictment  the definition of robbery is as follows  a person is guilty of robbery if he steals and immediately before or at the time of doing so and in order to do so he uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force  in short it is dealing with force  further a person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention permanently depriving the other of it and thieve and steal shall be construed accordingly however for the purposes of this case it is not disputed that there were thirteen robberies  the only dispute is whether the defendant was the robber in each of these robberies  i shall deal with the thirteenth count first as it was how the case was presented to you by the prosecution  the victim of the robbery madam pau yuk ping told you that on the ninth of september ninety-one around eight p m she took the lift at her home on the twelfth floor six seven o shanghai street  she was robbed by a man with a knife about ten inches to one foot long  on the tenth floor in the lift  she shouted ah three times  properties taken from her are as follows  bracelet which was pulled from her from her as the robber found she was too slow in removing it  it was therefore broken  a necklace with a round jade pendant attached to it and on the jade pendant there were two chinese character long life one on each side  there was one finger ring and a wad of ten dollar notes about ninety to hundred dollar she describe the robber as wearing dark blue t-shirt dark trousers  something like black very thin very dark about five feet four or five inches  age was something between thirty-five and forty  the robber told her to get out of the lift and he went down in the lift himself  madam pau pau s shout at the time when the robbery was heard by pw two mr ching yau kei the resident of flat b on the tenth floor  he looked through the spy hole of his main door he saw a person in the lift took out something and gave it to the person who kept the lift door open  then the person inside the lift came out and the person who was keeping the door open went inside and the lift had gone  he suspected it was a robbery  he telephoned the caretaker pw three mr chin ying chau and told him the robbery and the robber was coming down in the lift he described the robber as wearing dark colour top wear he could not see his face he cannot remember his hair clearly he described the robber was a little bit bald the caretaker mr chin said he received the telephone call from pw two mr ching  about two or three seconds later someone came out of the lift  se serving the even number of floors he described that person as follows  thin build male age of thirty odd years to forty years old  black hair of ordinary length  he was wearing dark bluish colour t-shirt and a pair of black trousers height similar to mr chin himself i e five feet four inches or five inches  he then followed that person to five street and arygle street and then to portland street  he was about ten odd yards from him and was never out of his sight he went to a building in portland street  mr chin followed him up the building  and whilst mr chin was in the staircase landing between floor number two and floor number three he saw him opened the door to floor number three and went inside  mr chin then went back to shanghai building and led a number of police officers to that building later on identified as two two seven portland street second floor or floor number three  police knocked and someone on the door and someone open the door mr chin entered together with the police but didn't see the one he had followed then pw four pc four nine three seven eight knocked on the bathroom door no one answered he pulled open the door mr chin then saw said he saw the person he followed was the one inside the bathroom  mr chin said he was sure because it was a very short moment of about ten odd minutes after the time he followed him he told the police that was the man he had followed  that man whom he identifed turned out later on to be the defendant  he was told to go downstairs and he waited in a police vehicle  he was later on shown some clothings which he identifed as the same clothings worn by the man he had followed  they were the blue t-shirt and the trousers  he identify them to be exhibit one o eight and one o nine  madam pau were also shown these two exhibits one o eight and one o nine she identifed the blue t-shirt was the one worn by the robber and she believed the robber was wearing a pair of trousers similar to exhibit one o nine the evidence was that mr chin the caretaker said he identified the defendant as the one he had followed  members of the jury this is a trial where the case against the defendant depends  to a large extent on the correctness of one or more identications of the defendant which the defence allege to be mistaken i must therefore warn you of the special need for caution before convicting the defendant in relying on the evidence of identification  that is because it is possible for an honest witness to make a mistaken identification  there have been wrongful convictions in the past as the result of such mistakes  an apparently convincing witness can be mistaken  so can a number of apparently convincing witness examine carefully the circumstances in which the identification by each witness make  how long did he have the person he says of the defendant under observation at what distance  in what light  did anything interfere with that observation  had the witness ever seen the person he observed before  if so how often  in this case of course mr chin had not seen the defendant before  if only occasionally had he any special reason for remembering him how long was it between the original observation and the identification to the police  there any marked difference between the description given by the witness to the police when he was first seen by them and the appearance of the defendant  i must remind you the following specific weaknesses which appeared in the identification evidence in this case  the caretaker only saw the side of the face of the man when he came out of the lift  it was only a quick glance  he had never seen this man before  he was following this man at ten odd yards away with people between them in the street  he only saw his back whilst following him  he ran after that man from shanghai building to mongkok road as that man was also running and after that both were walking at normal pace  it was about twenty to thirty minutes later when mr chin identified the defendant  the light inside the bathroom door bathroom was quite dim  the light in the doorway where mr chin was was more the less the same i e quite dim which he believed there was a fluorescent light when the bathroom door was opened he only looked at him for a short while when he identified him to be the one he had followed  the police officer said defendant was identified by mr chin only on his way from the bathroom to the front cubicle  defence was that the identification by mr chin was a mistaken identification  question to be decided by you is whether you are sure the defendant as identified by mr chin the caretaker the man he had followed from shanghai building to two two seven portland street  then you heard the evidence of pc four nine three seven eight pw four  he was the one who pulled open the bathroom door and found the defendant inside  he asked the defendant where he had been and he said he had returned home from work then the defendant was asked which cubicle he occupied he said the front cubicle  police officer asked the defendant to take them to his cubicle i e cubicle c on the plan exhibit one seven seven b  inside the cubicle police office then asked the defendant which bed he occupied and he pointed at the upper bed of bed number four  he was asked what clothings he wore when he came home  he then pointed at exhibit one o eight and one o nine blue t-shirt and black trousers pc one nine two seven two pw six then searched the trousers in the presence of the defendant  he found the following items   a bundle of ten ten dollar notes i e hundred dollars in total  that is exhibit one one o a gold necklace with a jade pendant exhibit one o six a watch exhibit ninety-two a gold bracelet exhibit one o seven and two rings exhibit eighty-four and exhibit one one one pc four seven five seven zero then asked the defendant as to how he obtained those items  he did not answer the police officer  but members of the jury you must remember that the defendant is entitled to his right to silence  any person suspected of a criminal offence or charged with one is entitled to say nothing when he is asked questions about it  you must not hold his silence or refusal to answer question against him  pc four seven five seven zero then told the defendant he was under arrest defendant put on a top garment and a pair of sports shorts  suddenly he pushed off pc four seven five zero tried to run away he was held down by pc one eight five four and four nine three seven eight  later pc one nine two seven two showed the items he found in the trousers and the and the trousers and the blue t-shirt to mr chin and madam pau  madam pau identified exhibit one o six as her necklace and the jade pendant robbed from her earlier on  the broken bracelet exhibit one o seven was also shown to her but she had forgotten about the bracelet as she was ve as she said she was very frightened at that time  later on on the fourteenth of september a number of exhibits were shown to her and she identified exhibit one o seven was the bracelet robbed form her on the ninth september  the defence of the defendant was that on the ninth of september she went home after work she met uh mr chan hung who was a friend of a fellow resident mr au-yeung pui puang  chan hung asked the defendant to have dinner together defendant said she would like to have a bath first he went into the bathroom after taking off his t-shirt and trousers  in his room but he said he was not wearing
