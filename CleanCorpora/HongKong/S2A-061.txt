<I>
there is only one issue for you to consider and that is the
question of consent 
at the end of the day you have to ask yourself whether madam ho
consented to the conduct of the defendant
a lot of the crown ' s evidence is not being kept 
take for example there was no challenge as regard to forensic
evidence 
there is no challenge of contact evidence 
there is no challenge that the defendant did more or less
 the things described by madam ho 
what is in issue is whether there was consent on the part of
madam ho 
and this is a question of fact which you have to consider having
heard all the evidence
now members of the jury i told you when i opened the case to you
not too long ago that you are the sole judges of the facts of this trial
ultimately you will be the one who have to discharge the
responsibility of deciding whether or not the defendant is guilty or not
guilty of the charge of attempted rape 
now when you have to resolve matters of fact i have to urge you
to use your common sense and your experience of life 
don't venture into the realms of fantasies 
after all this is not a fantasy world 
this is a world of reality a world where you have to dis
 on the evidence as viewed who which is the correct which
are the facts that you can believe and accept 
and therefore it is so necessary for you to exercise your
common sense and your experience in life 
and of course in so doing you have got to have regard to the
demeanour of the witnesses 
and in this particular case all you have to decide is to to
have regard on the demeanour of madam ho while she was giving evidence 
and the demeanour of the defendant while he was giving evidence 
the rest of the witnesses the police officers the doctors 
the forensic scientists
their evidence is not challenged in the 1-word 
so you can accept their evidence if you of course feel that they are
reliable 
now as i say the only pertinant issue is the question of
consent and you have two versions which are diametrically opposed
now i venture to suggest to you madam ho was telling you the
true story 
she was telling you the true version of what occurred
now you ask yourself why did madam ho have to fabricate an
untrue story against the defendant 
they were strangers 
they had no match against each other before the
twenty-seventh of february of nineteen ninety-two 
her story was one of attempted rape and according to her
 the rape took place inside his car 
now even if you if she was to fabricate a story against the
defendant the story could have stopped on the events inside the car
inside the car 
she was the defendant was attempting to rape her remove her
trousers worn by her laid on her without her consent and then
ejaculated before he haven't before he ever penetrated her 
the story could have stopped at that 
why was it necessary for her to go on to fabricate a
further story of being humiliated or being subjected to the humiliation
 of being taken by the defendant for a short ride going to the beach
 in her underpants told to crawl underneath the lorry and
then throw her trousers away 
you will recall she said that when that she was frightened 
after the defendant had gone she crawl out from the underneath of the
lorry got back her trousers put them on and then walked home 
why was it necessary to fabricate this second 1-word
ask yourself
there was no reason whatsoever 
now another thing you have to consider members of the jury if i
may suggest to you ask yourself what possible motive did madam ho
have to fabricate this story against the defendant 
for what 
for five hundred dollars 
for a merely five hundred dollars which would obviously 
involve alarming her husband to this event 
of course you are all men of the world
imagine yourself if you are married what would you think what
would you feel if your wife were to come home one day and tell you 
somebody attempted to rape me
would a wife tell a false story like that 
and that ' s not all
and it ' s all for five hundred dollars 
it has been suggested by the defence that madam ho was in
financial difficulties
you have heard the evidence of madam ho
she deny this 
she was earning something in the region of eight thousand to ten
thousand dollars even more than what the defendant was earning 
and you have heard that her husband was making something
like seven thousand dollars 
they between themselves they had a simple family one young son
 and between themselves they had something like in the region of seventeen
to eighteen thousand dollars a month 
use your common sense 
why why 1-utterance 
but that is not at all
in order to make this report you will remember she had to go
through the ordeal of being physically examined 
you have seen the photographs 
she was photographs of her injuries were taken 
she was medically examined 
body fluids were taken from her several-words
 were taken 
use your common sense 
any woman whatever her character would find that as a
warning 
it was definitely not a pleasant thing 
and that is not all 
the worst is that she had to come here to tell you or all the
world this false story 
an attempted rape of force attempted rape of which she was the
victim 
now ask yourself 
it does not stand on common sense to tell a story 
like that 
she might not be a very educated person nor very sophisticated
you might think but judge her for yourself all she can do 
what was the motive 
was it worthwhile to do it to go all the way as she 
has done 
and i submit to you no woman in her proper senses would have
done such a thing would have fabricated this story 
now whereas on the other hand i can't say the same for the
defendant 
the defendant had every motive 
he lied to you to go into the witness box to give this story
this story 
you will remember his pager machine was found mis 
missing 
so the immediate immediate reaction by anyone it must have
been picked up by madam ho 
and once that has been picked up his identity will be 
proved 
he will be identified and the day will come when the police
will knock on his door
you will hear that he said in the witness box that he gave a
true address when applying for the machine the pager machine 
so eventually he knew that this is going his identity was
going to be found 
and that is why he went to the police himself 
and he has also told told you in the witness box he thought
that if he would make the report after madam ho did then it would
be more difficult for him to explain to the police
you may ask for yourself why why was it more difficult
the truth is the truth whatever way you look at it 
if you are telling the truth whether you tell it now you tell it
two days later two weeks later or two years later it ' s still the truth 
why 
because i suggest to you he thought that there was a peccable
advantage 
and that ' s that is why he went to the police 
and another thing i wish to put forward for your consideration is
about this conversation in the car asking about each other ' s job 
asking about hobbies 
now all this it ' s very easy to make up a story like this 
mind you it ' s never difficult for the defendant to find out
 the job of madam ho because madam ho gives evidence in the witness box
so the story could be made up just like that
the story could have been made up as the trial goes 
and then there is this sexual transaction 
with the greatest respect this is insulting to your
intelligence 
would you think it probable that the sex transaction could have
taken place could have suggested under this circumstances 
he was talking about the agreed sum of five hundred dollars
he was telling he had you believe he wanted you to believe he had
every intention to pay five hundred dollars but when i pressed him
whether he had the money he started to prevar prevaricate 
he even talked asked me whether i was talking about his money in
the bank 
he knew he wasn't 
would anyone if there was any truth in the defendant ' s
story have promised to pay if i may say so a prostitute what he
considered to be a prostitute five hundred dollars which he did
not have the money to pay at all 
mind you before he tried he had no idea that he was not
going to make it 
he has al he has told you that he had his sexual 
urges 
just the mention of a woman whom he never had a good
look 
he never had a look 
he had a look at her face 
he knew nothing about her 
is that possible members of the jury 
ask yourself 
to believe his story is to build castles in the air if i
may say so 
and of course in judging the proof or otherwise of what uh
someone is saying in the witness box of course you have as i say the
regard to his or her demeanour 
but at the same time you would also have to judge carefully 
the way in which he or she answers questions 
now let me mention to you two single instances while
while they ' re fresh in your mind where the defendant was convinced 
you will remember i asked him whether he was afraid 
of being discovered whether he was afraid of of having his identity
discovered once he found that his pager was missing
i had to ask few times and that question was never answered
and again i asked him whether he thought that it was
advantageous for him to make a report before madam ho did and again he
prevaricated 
no doubt members of the jury you will judge this for
yourselves
of course what i i ' m saying to you is my suggestion 
it ' s my suggestion with the intention of trying to help but
of course if you disagree with with me then no doubt you draw you own
conclusions 
now members of the jury on the consideration of the whole of the
evidence before 1-word i think your verdict can
only be one of guilty 
thank you very much 
members of the jury the uh issue is the one of consent 
there is no dispute as you uh would have gathered uh from evidence
that uh the uh the defendant does not dispute that he and madam ho
engaged in acts uh preparatory to sexual intercourse 
but the defendant of course said that he uhm during the the act
ejaculated prematurely uhm and therefore uh a lot of uh other evidence in
this case uh that as you would see not in dispute 
for instance there ' s no dispute the defendant was the owner of
pager that he worked the nightshift as a taxi driver and shared the shift
with a friend
uh as as you uh could uh remember uh not much dispute about uh
the scientific evidence uh which uh the prosecution uh elicited in order
i assume to prove that uh the defendant and madam ho engaged in certain acts
inside the taxi 
that again is not in dispute 
and it is right that uh members of the jury uh that the issue is
one of consent 
now in in a case like this uh members of the jury it ' s very
important uh to look for what is in law called uh corroboration 
now corroboration is really uh supporting evidence
the the the meaning of it uh is several-words 
and probably on monday 
but perhaps you you would uh uh like to hear now that uh in cases
like this it ' s very important to look for corroboration which uh really
means uh supporting evidence which implicates the defendant in the
commission of the crime and it must be independent evidence meaning
that uh it is uh evidence which has not come from uh the alleged uh victim
in other words we would look in this sort of case to whether there
are other evidence which indicate that the defendant had committed the
crime which evidence does not come form madam ho 
now the the importance of this uh is is of course uh the
danger that a witness may have been motivated by fantasy by neurosis 
by jealousy by spite or has consented to the sexual uh intercourse or
 1-or-2-words preparatory sexual intercourse but is too
ashamed or embarrassed to admit it 
and the law members of the jury that the uh the jury must
dispassionately analyse uh the accuracy of the uh victim ' s uh evidence in in
this sort of case 
and you will hear in due course from his lordship that that it
would be dangerous in this case to convict the uh defendant without
corroboration 
now members of the jury there is in fact no corroboration in this
case
the evidence uh implicating the defendant comes only from
uh from uh madam ho 
and therefore it ' s very important we should look very carefully
at the evidence of madam ho 
now it is true that as you might have heard that there are some
injuries on madam ho but that matter as as you will uh uh see uh uh 
are uh consistent with the defendant ' s case that he has engaged uh in
the struggle or scuffle uh uh with the defendant 
and therefore injuries uh on madam ho is not supporting evidence
nor uh corroboration uh in this case 
now the defence ' s case is that madam ho for some reason made up
uh her allegations against the defendant and uh you ' ll hear that uh 
you you have heard that the the evidence that that she complained to her 
hus to her husband uh does not uh refute that 
the fact of a a complaint to her husband again is not uh
corroboration in this case
