talking long-pause  you don't understand i understand uh huh  i think she had a very beautiful home in manchester  she told me she told me that sh your house have a frontyard and a backyard right  uh aw     four words  and a garden   and  uh big garden and uh i ' d like to have a garden   uhm uhm  with many many uh kind of fruit trees   apple trees  apple trees and   and uh strawberry bushes and redcurrant bushes  wow  uh huh  so     do you know we uh we have two two garden sheds so a garden shed is where you know the lawnmower and all the gardening equipment goes  and then we bought another shed and put it at the bottom of the garden and we put all our walking gear you know rucksacks   and walking boots  so much they all cost so much money and somebody broke into the shed and took everything  uhm so but some english people i know here uhm their some of their items were stolen from the garden shed and what the thieves did is they uh prise the roof off the garden shed they got you know what i mean prise uhm like a long stick and on the top of the wall where the the  roof comes down   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   wow   two-words like fishing   yeah  $c laughs took took the red the roof of the garden shed  they actually took the roof off   yeah  wow that means the whole roof is stolen   what what is the roof make of   wood it ' s all wood garden sheds are made of all wood  oh so it ' s easy for them to peel it off    yeah  i think the lock was quite difficult for them so they thought oh well all laugh find another way so they took the the roof   three-words steal thing inside   yeah all our walking gear were stolen mats and cotton hats and rucksacks and two-words boots   day time or night time they broke  in    night time  oh so no one know it huh   but those things you know so expensive walking boots they cost about one hun  well one hundred pounds   yeah  wow so expensive   one thousand two hundred hong kong dollars two words   but even they stole it they they ' re useless for them because maybe theirs their their foot is not the same size as yours   but what they do in england is they are like in america apparently they started in america car boot sales   yes  oh   so on a sunday you go everybody goes in their car and they lift the boot four words  and just sell things and this is how the thieves sell things they ' ve stolen   one-word   yeah   oh sell their things off  yeah we we used to have that in our school  car boot sale   oh did you  it ' s like kind of like a garden fete sort of thing   and then we tried to raise money for the school    uhm uhm  but uh uh is the things much cheaper than you buy in uh department store if uh you buy it in the is it called a car boot sale     car boot sale oh yeah yeah much cheaper  so even though they steal the shoes that worth worth one hundred dollars when that sell it that time i i think it ' s much cheaper right   yeah  uh huh  sihk daan gou translation: eat cake  thank you   thank you so what tape cuts off and restarts so i don't say louh bai  $z incorrectly pronounces the cantonese for ' boss'. ' louh baan ' is the correct pronunciation. for boss  no no louh baan is   louh baan is okay  louh baan     louh baan   louh baan  it ' s okay sometimes you would say uh  i think louh baan is a little bit different from  bo sih cantonese for ' boss '  boss you know uh someone uh at the top of you  uh for example you work in a company uh the one uh    louh baan  the next person in charge   well   the the person in charge of  of you is your boss right but uh he is not your louh baan   louh baan is the one he you know he own the shop  or he run the business so     yeah   oh right   uh   the very big one  yeah or maybe not very big one he just own a very small store he can be a louh baan     oh yeah someone laughs   louh baan  yeah  yeah just say louh baan is not a slang  neih louh baan literally means ' you boss'. used as a vulgar slang expression in cantonese speech someone laughs  why is neih louh baan a slang it's some kind of euphemism  huh huh    oh right  and uhm  intelligible speech in cantonese  you can say neih haih louh baan  translation: you are the boss  you are haih ' haih ' means ' are ' in this case  is something like a verb to be so you say neih haih louh baan  is okay i think you better don't teach her this kind  $d laughs  too difficult you make you will make her confuse uh huh yeah you will confuse up because that ' s not the uh  polite way of saying uh things like something you know a little bit insulting people uh uh like uh    oh right   i think  yeah that ' s been the hardest thing for me to learn  $a laughs because you know english are so polite  yeah laughs    and it ' s taken a long time for me to shrug all that off you know to clear my mind of it  cos always you know people open the door for you then people ' ll say thank you  you go to the supermarket and you say oh thank you but here  someone laughs just throw things in a bag money quick go  i think especially in hong kong it ' s a very busy city    and and the and the language is changing so fast even you know uh if a person who live in hong kong you live for one or two years and when you come back maybe you cannot catch up with the language because there are always some kind of language newly  invented changed    yeah   changed   hou gik a translation: very extreme/awesome  yeah like slangs right  yeah   yeah  you you don't understand sometimes i don't understand what my student talking about  $c laughs  yeah really because they talk some language you know be  belong to the teenagers    really   oh   some  very abstract yeah and then i don't understand you know they have a different kind of slang   why  yeah so i think it ' s difficult for a foreigner to you know to to pick up the language  maybe you ' re very angry or you ' re very happy you can say the same word uh huh  hou hou gik a translation: very extreme/awesome. ' hou ' meaning ' very ' in this case is repeated in the beginning of the utterance by the speaker   wah ne go ngh ji mei two-words  translation: this i do not know what [ 2 unclear words]. ' wah ' is used as an exclamation in cantonese speech. $c is trying to say that even she, a cantonese speaker, cannot comprehend such newly-coined cantonese expressions as ' hou gik a'.  yeah  i haven't heard that word before   haih Ã  ngoh douh haih am am sik ga translation: yes, i just know about it [ not long before]  yeah you know some they just uh watch the tv and learn some new slang and if you don't you don't watch that tv programme you don't know what they are talking about yeah so it ' s difficult yeah to learn    uhm   ah right one-word  there are lot of lot of lots of many kinds of expression that you don't understand the meaning yeah   uhm interesting  i i just thinking if i go to live in london for nine months or for one year maybe uh you know i can learn   the the language  the language yeah two-words     but you know even london has its own language   like uhm what they called   huh huh  the cockney dialect   yeah the pearly queens have you heard of those  no

pearly queen lan     well  the kind of oxford english is like very very best english  uh huh   uhm but then like pearly queen english is more like  working class english because you know i listen to

oxbridge  oxbridge  oh oxford and cambridge     so it ' s like oxford and cambridge  oxbridge   yeah  we call it oxbridge english he doesn't speak that  he doesn't speak that language  i think in hong

uh   one of them was spanish  uh huh spanish uh princess   he kept having the heads of his wives chopped off  when they couldn't give him a son  but what everybody knows is it ' s the man who  determines the sex of the child so the fault was with him not with the eight wives he had   yeah   wow   yeah   uhm uhm but finally he got son huh he got a son   yeah i think the son died though at a very early age  yeah  $c laughs    i think so i should know but i can't remember i think so  i think there ' s this disease runs in the royal family is that true is it  what ' s it what ' s this disease called  i think it ' s called one-word  it runs in the royal family which i learn in biology   right  is it because of too close marriage between their cousins   and the   no no no it ' s a kind of blood disease and then i had to learn it  be because it ' s it ' s got something to do with genetic   haemophilia  i think so haemophilia   so that ' s people if if they just bang their body or they they can bleed to death   yeah   yeah   ah   baahk hyut bihng cantonese for haemophilia  is it the kind of disease  yeah   haih a cantonese for ' yes '   haih a  you know huh huh and then when you hurt yourself uh hurt hurt yourself if you know the the blood will you know cannot stop   four words never stop never stop right inaudible speech by someone  that ' s not the kind of disease only for royal family right so no it ' s but they have it they have it in the  royal family  oh  just for royal family all laugh    but many english people are against princess diana they say you know that uh she ' s too weak  too weak   w e a k she isn't a strong person and uhm she  she wants everything for herself so many people are against her    uhm uhm   against her  you mean the english people  in england    uhm  now uh huh   even now  but i also heard some people saying that you know uh  diana you know that that i i heard the man say that he say once you marry into the royal family you have to you know keep the rule of the royal family so you know that being a queen uh you you you uh enjoy a luxurious ways of life so you you get something you have to pay for it   so they ' re saying that she is being too you know uh how to say it    oh yeah   uh  too greedy i think greedy   yeah too greedy  she got her uh luxurious li ways of life and then  uh being famous but but she also want to have love   yes that ' s right   yeah that ' s too much for her   uhm laughs  yes so so it ' s the man saying that she ' s you know they they think that she ' s wrong she is the one the one who she she doesn't keep the rule of the royal marriage   i think we should get rid of the royal family yeah why   you think we should get rid of it  yeah they ' re wasting all the people ' s money i can't see any point having it    two cantonese words  uhm  because they ' re not actually doing anything for the country yeah and then they can live a luxurious life   of course they represent the country  well yeah they represent the country but they are not actually doing much things to improve the country are they   so you are a paul keating fan  uh not really a fan but   you know the prime minster of australia wants australia to become a republic not commonwealth  yeah   uh huh  but it really depends but how about the people in england uh uh  do they like the royal family  most of them most of them     oh yeah  many people are in in england are very respectful  of the queen you know  like   uhm uhm  so do you find it o offensive if like people talk about the royal family   well depends what they talk about if they talk about the royal family and say they ' re very good and  oh yeah   but if they ' re critical and one-word  it ' s just the way english people are brought up we ' re all taught to respect the royal family   it ' s just like people in china think that deng xiaoping is  you know   two-words   to the royal family   oh no one like deng xiaoping someone laughs  i think they are not really respect him i think even though they don't    alright  in china in china too i think uh now i i have some friends come from china they they told us that uh you know most of the people you know they they really don't believe in communism but they are the one who you know already got the  inaudible speech in cantonese  they are the privileged class so they don't want to give up their privilege   right  yeah how about chairman mao chairman mao i don't know but uh some people told me uh you know uh  they they they didn't like him when he died people you know their heart k uh keep on laughing but they just pretend to be very sad   uhm  uh you know the friend of uh hypocrites no not p because they can't they can't show their real feeling you know in in in china so uh you remember uh ming sun ' s name of a person uh schoolmate  huh huh  lily lily yeah her mother came from china you know  he told he he told uh auntie bo ting  name of a person uh when uh when  chairman mao died he he was in china and then he work in a you know in in a in a certain place and the people just uh cried uh feel ve uh cried very loudly and show their you know uh grievance  two-words   uh huh    uhm  but when they run into the toilet they say they close the door and then they they can't keep uh    stop crying  laughing laughs  laughing yeah that ' s why they they say that you can't trust anybody because uh you don't know uh what they will do to you but they they  they ' re not to show their real feeling and   that ' s another difference i have found coming here because english people are so open  english people are so open     yes so open with their feelings and  you know uh   uh huh  but compare with the american people is that uh uh the  british people is more you know uh  they they uh i think they ' re not so open in showing their  f feeling right  conservative    the english people  yeah compare with the american     compare with the americans they are  yeah  they ' re more open right others laugh    but the chinese people here are so quiet you know don't say don't tell anybody i have said this to you and they ' ll they won't they don't want uh other people to know because they don't know who might be listening you know   but i think it depends on uh  i think it now most of the gen uh new generation they  they they are uh always ready to show their feeling right you mean  i don't ' know i don't know uh   i mean most of the uh new  generation the young young people   yeah   but not to their parents yeah maybe someone they trust or they think that they  because to their parents they they think that they have a generation gap right yeah  not for me   ah but to the  you no need to told me that i know you  $z and $a laugh    i think maybe deng xiaoping is dead i don't  maybe yeah some some people just guess  because he haven't s s s uh show shown up shown up for a long time uh not even in the chinese new year but why is his death so important  i don't know but i think he represent something yeah    yeah  but how come one person uh make millions of people think  his way how can that happen one-word  i ask the same question to some chinese uh people i mean the people they came from china they think you just can't understand their way  uh just talking they in fact i think uh deng is not so  influential  but some uh people they already got their privileges  they don't want the society to have any change political  one or the the e economically  and so so they just you know even they they ' re uh how to say  they they they ' re not really believe in what he say or what  uh the the communist way of ruling the society but they you know they just let it run the way    right   uhm   uhm uhm  so they keep they keep them in high positions so that they can enjoy their own interests  yeah   their their  yeah   so in english you would say that they go along with the flow  they ' re like a river flows   yeah yeah yeah  uh they go along with the flow  uh huh    huh huh with the flow  but really  they say what they really think is not what what they say  you know  huh they say some of them you know they already received uh western  education they uh have wealth and they you know they know different culture the western way of culture and the chinese one they have comparison they they let their children receive western education but they still you know uh uh they they still think that they believe the communist way of ruling the country but actually they ' re not really they ' re not real communist  so we can't understand them    uhm   uhm   uhm  it just seems that maybe lots of things will come to our head in nineteen ninety-seven like deng xiaoping is probably dead and  but i just doubt uh whether deng is still alive or dead that ' s i think is not not that important right   but many business people seem to think that it will make a huge difference to the world financially once it is announced that he is dead  but in fact uh i think people can guess that he will die sooner or later just within these few years  he ' s so old and so weak  uhm  so we i think no one will believe he will live up to one hundred years old  uh huh     uhm   uhm uhm   right   uhm  but it ' s going to be very difficult for foreign people to accept the rules of china after nineteen ninety-seven like i think in chini a policeman can just arrest you for no reason at all you just walk down the street and he can say come here and you are put in jail so   is it really like that so horrible    well  apparently that ' s what ' s happening america is trying to make china change its human rights policy  uhm uhm but i i i i don't believe uh if a ordinary people  i mean uh just like uh common people like us i think they won't do that kind of thing to you uh maybe that person have some political ba background  or they ' re doing something inside china that  you know against their system but i think for ordinary people i i don't think that they will arrest you in that way    uh right   right  uhm uhm  yeah and some people are just doubt you know uh hong kong the the the political situation of of hong kong   uhm uhm  what will change after ninety     it will just
