""
and these sales team uhm uhm are responsible for their products
""
uh you may you may not believe that the total number of dupont
sales team is only around thirty person 
""
so for more details about dupont sales team and i would like to
pass on to pamela to introduce to you
""
""
thank you lily
""
now after having an overview of the general background of dupont
 now let focus on the sales team
""
dupont sales team is best described as an elite sales team which is
characterized by members ' high education level
""
for example salesmen in dupont must be university graduates or at
least polytechnic graduates and if if and in its china office even salesmen
with a master degree or a phd degree is employed
""
moreover salesmen should have business vision and sense
""
general managerial skills professional selling techniques
analytical abilities tolerance of pressure self-motivation and good time
management
""
but all these quality seem seem to be that of a manager instead of
a mere salesman
""
but that  ' s exactly what dupont want
""
as one of his group manager said a salesman in dupont can fulfil
the work of a sales manager in other company
""
but actually why should dupont need such an elite sales team
""
now uhm it  ' s mainly  a few words  it  ' s because
of dupont uhm special company philosophy it  ' s market coverage and the role
of salesman in dupont
""
first of all we will look at uhm dupont company  poli  uh
philosophy
""
first of all uhm  dupont  dupont treats buyers as partners
""
what  ' s that mean
""
that means dupont other than the selling selling products to
different costumers and uh fulfilling their needs  moreover dupont wants
to establish long-term co-operation with their customers
""
but how to  achi  achieve this
""
this is mainly the work of their salesmen
""
they have to be very clear about the customers uhm the customer  ' s
situation  need and difficulty so as to provide appropriate goods and
services for them
""
and another part that dupont stress much is that uhm is that the
salesman services should add value to the products that they are selling
""
in other words when customers buy at dupont they don't just get
what they have paid for
""
instead they will receive a total offering of products and services
""
a productional services that uhm add that maximise their benefits
""
to conduct such kind of need satisfaction status salesmen must be
very mature
""
and also they should apply good communication skills selling
techniques analytical ability and quick wit through intensive training and
exposure to various kinds of knowledge
""
and then come to the second reason why dupont need such an elite
sales team
""
it  ' s  uhm it  ' s dupont  ' s market coverage
""
salesman in dupont have to be responsible for both the hong kong
and china market
""
so and there are uhm different economy uh to assign different time
uh to assign the time and efforts in both of these market
""
in this case uh they should have the kind of business sense or
vision so as to determine which market are having more potentials and uh so
that they should have put more attention on it
""
moreover and salesman in dupont are not bound by individual  ' s
quota
""
so they must be self-motivated in order to uhm in order to keep up
with their tight working schedule
""
and finally uhm the salesman uh in dupont they also have to take up
part of the managerial work uhm duty in china branch
""
for example setting programme setting sales forecast for them and
monitoring the china office uhm  s  programme
""
since uh the salesmen have to do such kind of managerial work they
should have uhm managerial knowledge experiences and techniques
""
finally uhm we come to the part the role of salesmen in dupont
""
as we see a salesman in dupont equals a sales mangers in other
companies
""
that means uhm salesman in dupont have the multiple role of a
manager and a salesman
""
one example of their working as a manager is that they have to
conduct different market that will have different market of researches  so
as to  one-word  the dynamic market trends uh market trend
""
in this case sales man in fact of being a mere salesman they have
to be an all-round businessman
""
so as we can see the workload for salesmen in dupont is really
extremely  extremely big the  work  the workload is really very
heavy and so is the pressure that they have to face
""
they have to face very different challenges other than that of
selling
""
so it  ' s no doubt why dupont should  employ  an elite sales
team
""
to build such kind of elite sales team is no easy task but to
motivate them is even difficult
""
so in the following section our team-mate christine and eliza is
going to introduce to you the motivation system used in dupont and why such
systems are effective
""
""
thank you pamela
""
in this part lisa and i are going to focus on one point that is how
to motivate such an elite sales team
""
in the model of psychological determinants of motivation we can
find that there are three elements directly influencing the level of
motivation
""
mainly expectancy instrumentality and the balance for the work
""
expectancy is the perceived linkage between the increased effort
and the  im  improved performance
""
and instrumentality is the linkage between improved performance and
the attainment of improvement reward
""
while the others for reward is the perceived desirability of 
receiving more of a particular reward
""
in the case of dupont  there are various policies and practices
 influencing the motivation the process of the elite sales team
""
uhm and these factors can explained by the  psycho  uh
psychological determinants just mentioned
""
for expectancy dupont tries to match to make every salesman works
smarter through training and organisation variable
""
in in regards to training  each manager in dupont has to design
uhm specific  pro  training programmes for uh each of the salesman of
the subordinating sales team  according to the uh job nature and personal
variables
""
and the relationship between uhm the salesmen and the manager are
very close
""
and the communication is very good
""
so the the salesmen can always be consulted
""
excuse me
""
can always be consulted on their uhm uhm  re  responsibility
and the autonomy is very harsh
""
by this way dupont makes every effort on their salesmen very
effective so that the perceived uh relationship between increased effort and
improves the performance  one-word  is very high
""
for instrumentality excuse me  for instrumentality dupont
increase the prestige uh sorry increase the uh improve uh the prestige
relationship between improved performance and attainment of increased reward
by compensation and promotion
""
for compensation dupont does not have the uhm provision system
instead uhm bonus is given to salesmen of good performance and uh to come to
supplement the high salary
""
and the most important is however the promotion
""
dupont doesn't not promote the salesmen according according to
seniority
""
instead salesmen are promoted only when they have good performance
""
and hence the uhm  the salesman can easily perceive a higher
relationship between uh improved performance and the attainment of increased
rewards
""
and how about the values for reward lisa

income
""
taxpayer earns thirteen months salary thirteen months salary of
eight thousand dollars per month
""
eight thousand dollars per month
""
and a commission of thirteen thousand dollars
""
commission of thirteen thousands dollars
""
and housing benefit
""
a housing benefit is granted is provided to the taxpayer in the
form of a housing allowance
""
a housing allowance of two thousand and five hundred dollars per
month is provided to the taxpayer in order to cover  the rent he paid
""
and the rent pay per month is two thousand dollars only
""
two thousands dollars only
""
as you can see in fact the housing allowance is more than enough
okay
""
it is more than the rent actually paid by the uh  uh by
taxpayer
""
and in stead that means the excess of five hundred dollars will be
taxed as a  cash allowance
""
the five hundred dollars per month will be taxed as a additional
income
""
additional income provided by the taxpayer
""
as well as we have to calculate the rental value of the quarter
provided because this is a full reimbursement of rent paid by the employee
""
that means a free accommodation must provided by the employer
""
and in respect of this we have to calculate the rental value
""
and the next is the allowance expense
""
there are three hundred dollars uh allowance expense per months
""
okay we assume this
""
and there is an  allowa  depreciation  allowa  uh
depreciation allowance available to the taxpayer which is four hundred
dollars
""
four hundred dollars
""
because of only compute once uh depreciation allowance so this is
an annual deduction
""
annual 
""
let  ' s look at the computation
""
first of all we have to include annual salary employments
""
uh in this case thirteen months salary at eight thousand dollars
per month it provided
""
so the total is one o four thousand dollars
""
and the next commission income
""
thirteen thousand dollars
""
and next is the excess of the housing allowance
""
this is treated as an uh cash income an an additional income 
in form of cash okay
""
so the housing allowance is two uh two thousand five hundred per
uh per month
""
and the rent pay is two thousand only
""
so the excess is six hundred dollars  for the whole year
""
this is treated as additional income
""
so the total income is one hundred and twenty three thousand
dollars
""
this is the total income  before the calculating of uhm rental
value of course
""
we have not yet calculated rental value
""
and let  ' s look at the expense first
""
we know that the deductible expense for the month is three hundred
dollars
""
so the whole year deductible expense is three thousands and six
hundred dollars
""
and the deflation allowance is four hundred dollars
""
so the total deductible expense is four thousand dollars
""
four thousand dollars
""
why do we need to look at the expense first
""
because when we calculate the rental value rental value of the
quarter provided or of any subsidising accommodation we have to compute it on
ten percent
""
ten percent on the total income as reduce by the  allowal 
deductions
""
as reduced by  allowal  deductions
""
uh so make you  ' d you  ' ll uh  re  you  ' ll remember to
deduct the expense before you calculate the rental value
""
otherwise you will uh get the wrong figure for the rental value
included okay
""
so you have to deduct the expense first from the  from the
accessible income in order to calculate the rental value okay
""
so the total accessible from the employer from the employment is
one hundred and forty four thousand nine hundred dollars
""
one hundred and thirty four nine  hun  nine thousand
dollars
""
and then we deduct the expense all the expense available
""
efficient allowance and the expense
""
four thousand dollars and the net accessible income  or the
income after deducting expense from the accessible income is one hundred and
thirty thousand nine hundred dollars
""
one hundred and thirty thousand nine hundred dollars
""
so this is the format in computing the income of a taxpayer
""
next we  ' ll see another review which is available under salary tax
""
but this is not an exam this is review
""
when the  front  compute uh the accessible income or the
net accessible income of taxpayer we need to deduct the outflowings and
expense as well as the depreciation allowance from the accessible income
""
and losses will occur losses will occur when the total of the
outflowings and expense  and the depreciation allowance exceeds the total
accessible income of taxpayer okay
""
for example during the year he has only ten thousand uh income but
his own expense is more than ten thousand then in that case losses will occur
losses will occur
""
but under sales tax this should be a a  s  a random uh i
mean a very uhm remote  s  uh case
""
this should not happen much okay because under sales tax one
should not incur lot in fact
""
so this is quite seldom seldomly happen when loss occur
