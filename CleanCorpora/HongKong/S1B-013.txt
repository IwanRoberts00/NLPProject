<I>
now that or if you like this itself cylinder subcircuit
 you will have one circuit for every cylinder okay
and the the whole circuit the whole system will bear of in
number of this kind of subcircuits 
it gave you all the number of cylinders you are operating
if you got two cylinders then you have two cylinders subcircuits
right in that film you you have seen two cylinder subcircuits
 okay
one depended they are there ' s a one point zero to designate the
cylinder or the up uh lifting cylinder and the cylinder two point zero for
the shifting cylinder
now in the example that you have just seem about the completion
signal of a certain operation is used as a signally signal or or or uh
activate signal for initiating the next operation in the cylinders okay
so in fact they use the completion signal to lo initiate or
activate the next operation a long pause 
we we used a to denote the lifting cylinder b to denote the zip
 uh shifting cylinder and after the lifting we do the shifting
right then the lifting cylinder will return and the shifting
cylinder returns okay
and this is the sequence that we have realized
right extension of the first one extension of second one retraction
of first one retraction of the second one
and the completion signal of this is used to initiate its
operation
the completion signal of this is used to initiate that
the method of using the completion signal of the current operation
to activate the next operation is called intricative method
okay
now or this case you can use intricative method to
construct and working such a long pause 
now if you turn to page twenty of unit fifteen you will find a
circuit here that is trying to realize a sequence which is slightly
different from that one 
with the last two operations being interchanged first okay
one of example of these operation is the drink the 
drink uh operation
suppose a operates the one-word b operates the
 one-word okay
now if the drain are blocked first by this is
first of all you need to climate okay and then you lower the
 several words 
you try to do may reuse the camp right
now if you are doing that instead of transferring the blocks then
you need to have these two cylinders
the operation of these two cylinders being interchange okay
now if you do that and you try to use the initiative uh sorry 
intricative method then a long pause 
now it is the cylinder subcircuit for say a a long
pause 
and you you will have another cylinder subcircuit for b
this is the air trainer the cylinder the control vowel the
completion signals that may be used to activate the operations a long
pause 
now if we use annotation that the cylinders are denoted by
alphabets say a and b the upper case alphabets
with the completion signals being generated for a we use lower case
a for b we use lower case b
the suffix zero indicate retraction completion slope uh completion
signal
the suffix one indicate this is the completion signal for the
extension struck okay a long pause 
and we use plus to indicate the expansion minus to indicate
retraction
now if we use the intricative method the operation
immediately receiving the extension of a will be the retraction of a
so the completion signal of thes operations presh 
perceiving that will be a zero okay
so you may use this a zero to activate the extension of a 
after the a has expanded and in complete it ' s act uh expansion
then a one will be generated
now this a one will be used to extend b so a one will be used
to extend b
after b has extend b one will be generated so b one is used to 
retract b okay
after the retraction from of b has been completed b zero will be
generated and that b zero will be used to retract a
now this is the circuit itself used intricative method
you ' ll see whether this can work or not right
now suppose you wanted to the a to expand when we look at the
control signals this a log is presented right
now initially b is is and is fully retracted state so b log is
presented as well
you ' ll see immediately that there are a plus and a minus present
simultaneously okay
so in other words we are in a situation that a the cylinder a
is being asked to move out while the signal for moving in is still there
the cylinder a has to be sign on whether to do the extension
operation or stay in okay right
the two activate signal is are two signals are presented
simultaneously right
so these two signals are fighting against each other in fact
so this situation is a condition that we call fighting signals
are presented
now a long pause now if you look at the time diagram of
the operations a long pause 
now if if we try to draw or geographically represent the
positions of the cylinder
initially both cylinders will be here right both of them are being
retracted
now when cylinder a expands then the a will travel out okay
during the extension of a b remains and is retracted position okay
now after a has been expanded b starts to move out a stays there
okay
this is the lowering of the one-word right
you have one-word the required left so you
will retract the one-word 
we will see while the several words 
after you have retracted uh one-word then you
can release your one-word cylinder
right so this is the timing diagram for the whole cycle right 
and therefore the periods of example is that we have the timing
diagram like that okay
uh we have just interchange the last two operations okay
now if you you look at that and if we are using the 
intricatve method to design the service final service then
we are using these completion signal to energize the next operation between
stand operation
and then you use this to energize this operation use that to
energize this operation and that to activate this operations okay uh so 
right
now if you study the timing diagram you will find that when you 
wants a to move out the signal asking a to move in is that signal
alright
it is feel that when you want the sin uhm the b to
move out the signal for b to move in is not there so if do you have any uh
difficulty here
however if you want to move b in the signal to move b out is still
here alright so we got quite a signal here right
in this whole cycle we have two situation that we have fighting
signals right
now these fighting signals can be seen or we can find out the
fight uh the conditions with fighting signals by looking at the timing
diagram
now a long pause 
if you try to write down what are the completion signals or the 
signals that are presented at various stage 
at the moment that you want a to extend you will have a zero and b
zero presented
at the moment you want b to extend you will have a one and b zero
when you want b to retract you will have a one and b one
at the moment when you want a to retract you have a one b zero
 a long pause 
now if we use intricative method we note but we will
have fighting signals okay
if we try to use the combination of all these signals and see
whether we have fighting signals now suppose if you use both a the
completion signals for a and uh and b to energize or to activate the
operations
for a to be extended we need a zero and b zero
for b to be extended we need a one and b zero
for b to be retracted we need a one and b one
in other to who retracting uh to retract a we need a one and b zero
now if you examine the one-word signal for the
extension of a you need that
for retraction of a you need that
they both have b zero but the as are different 
you need a a zero together with b zero to extend a you need a a one
together with b zero to retract a okay
this combination is clearly different from that
so when a the signal for a to extend is presented the signal for a
to retract is not presented
if you look at the b a one b zero will be the signal required
to extend b 
a one b one will be a combination required to retract b
the two signals are different so you won't have fighting for b as
well
apparently you seem to have solved the problem of fighting signals
okay
get a the extension and the retraction signals are different okay
alright
but in the you look at the signals the combinations in more
detail and you will find the combination for extending b and the
combination for retracting a 
these two combinations are detail they are the same
right
so when you have these combination of a one and b zero which
operations are you going to whether you are going to extend b or whether you
are going to retract a
you need to differentiate these two right
so it depends on the past history of the operations
and if we just look at we use a combination logic to initiate the
operations to activate the operations then we do not know the history right
and this introduce introduces another situation we
call that ambiguity
the system is ambiguous right it doesn't know what to do
it it got confused
now so we having using the combination of the completion
signals to activate the operations solve the problem remove fighting signals
but it introduces ambiguity
right so we need to find some way to overcome this difficult a
long pause 
now if we use the time map to represent the logic combinations of
various states of the completion signals
when we have a zero b zero we are here we would like to have the a
being extended right
on completion of this operation the combination of the logic
signals we will be having is a one b zero
so we will be here that we ' ll like to extend the b
on completion of that we have a logical combination of a one and b
one
it is here that we wanted b to retract right a long pause 
it is at the end of this operation that we are in this situation
again 
then we like to have uh a retract
it is at this logic combination that we have two different
operations required
so when you look at the k map the column map whenever you will
find two different operations to be carried out at different stage of the
cycle that indicates ambiguity
it is the ambiguous condition we need somehow to separate this
to put so that you have only one operation in each square okay 
right
so that demands the internation of a second variable we
call it auxiliary variable a long pause 
now if you denote this auxiliary variable with uh the la uh
letter x 
by x it begin that the auxiliary variable is not presented
x indicate the auxiliary variable is presented okay 
now if we try to put down the phone uh the signal phone path
in the k map that initially we have this and we got a extend b extend
now it ' s onl it is only after the the b retraction
operation that we will have ambiguity
so before we retract the b it is the time that we need to do
our separation
so we will introduce our secondary variable be activate the
auxiliary variable to make the auxiliary variable present at this progress
so the even though we still have b one and a one but the auxiliary
signal is presented after that
so we have move ourself to here now if reduce the b minus
here 
then we will be putting ourself into this situation
rather than here okay
so this is the time that we produce out log a retraction so
 will be here feeling after the retraction of a
now it is time fear that we need to remove our secondary
variable
so to make ourself at the beginning of the cycle
again okay
the flow if you like that okay
so initially we will be uh logic combination with a zero b zero
and x bar the completion signal is what presented then we will have a one b
zero auxiliary not presented and then we will have a one b one x x still not
present here
now we introduce a x we will be in the situation that a one b one
and x are there
we retracted the b twenty eight prefer the x they are
 two-words situation again okay
now instead of having just four operations a plus b plus b
minus and a minus we introduce two more operations
as a result we got six operations
out of these six only four are associated with the actual cylinder
movements okay
these are mean the change or the uh of the control
signals right 
this one is the operations that we are going to change 
buys into x uh in we are fear to introduce the secondary
variable right
initially the secondary variable is absent and then we make it
present okay 
uh the purpose of introducing the secondary variable is to
separate the two operations a long pause 
right remember that one if you have this situation then
you will have this two different operations required the same logic
combinations
it is the situation at which we do not know what to do whether to
do the a minus or the b plus
so in order to solve this problem we introduce the secondary
variable to make the two different
the first in fact this is the the ru uh recording of the
history of the cycle in that
so when the first present of the combination of a one and b
log while the auxiliary variable is still absent we do the b plus
after that we intr introduce the secondary variable
so when a one and b log appear again this time we have the
auxiliary variable
so the combination of a one and zero remains the same but the
condition of the auxiliary variable is different
so we have separate the two okay
so for every square here we do not have more than one operation if
we move stability right okay now
