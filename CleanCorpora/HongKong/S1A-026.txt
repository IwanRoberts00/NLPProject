""
""

""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and so uh i will not have much much bad feeling
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and i will feel sad only at the beginning
""
the first week   i  only felt sad
 
""
 okay  
""
yup 
""
""
at the first week
""
and afterwards i can adapt to   a  new environment at all
 
""
 yeah  
""
uh   right  
""
""
 no   problem
 
""
how about charlotte 
""
""
oh well that was my first time go abroad and uhm well in fact
uhm i like english life very much and uhm well uhm i i   i 
 
""
 what   what do you mean by english life 
""
""
 tut  yeah uhm the  tut  the food they eat and
the the pace of their living
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and uhm well the the most interesting thing is that uhm well
uh i think i  ' m a bit odd and uh all my friends they they were homesick but i
wasn't
""
""
yeah
 
""
yeah
""
were you homesick patrick 
""
""
only at the   first 
 
""
 only   only at the beginning 
""
""
yeah at the beginning
""
and afterwards i  all of my  time was occupied by my job
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
my task homework uh my exercise
 
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
so i have no time to think about     homesick
 
""
 oh  
""
what  how did you feel when you were homesick
""
what  how did you know that you were homesick 
""
""
ah yeah that  ' s a   good point 
 
""
 yeah  
""
what what what what does it mean being homesick 
""
""
uhm suddenly i will feel alone
 
""
all right 
""
""
yeah think about my parents    my  brother my
young nephew my young niece and ah suddenly i think the place i  ' m living now
is  tut  quite strange for me
 
""
 yeah  
""
yeah    uh   
""
""
 a   hundred percent strange
""
  and  i have to use different language and   
 that  ' s that  ' s the most difficult thing uhm     i think in
uk
 
""
 okay  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
and you agree charlotte that was 
""
""
uhm well in fact i i i missed my family but uhm i i don't
think that i was homesick
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uhm well but uhm some of my colleagues uhm they well wherever
they went uhm they they will say that oh that building looks like some what
buildings   in hong kong 
 
""
 yeah yeah  
""
  okay okay  
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
 
""
so they kept making the comparison   between  hong kong
and 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
 
""
yeah uhm what  what did they do for you the trip
""
did you did you discover anything about yourself 
""
""
uhm yeah i think
""
""
yah very much
 
""
  what  what did you
""
you said you were stranger or odd that was the word you use 
 you said you were   one word  did you discover
that in england or did you know that   already  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 yah yah  
""
 uh   i i know that already but uhm such feeling was so
strong uhm when i was staying in england
""
uhm especially when uhm i liked to do everything that is different
from all all   my  friends like to do
""
and uhm for example i went very berry picking
""
i i liked to go to the art galleries but
 
""
 uhm  
""
yeah 
""
""
none of them want to go there
 
""
right right okay
""
and what about you   patrick  
""
""
 uh   yeah
 
""
did you discover anything about yourself 
""
""
i love the culture the and the culture of uh britain
 
""
  uhm  
""
""
 and   when uh there were uh two times that uh the
trip was guided by a tourist guide and i try my tried my best to ask as many
as as many as  pro  questions as   i could 
 
""
 uh huh   
""
""
and so uh i feel very interested in uh why there  ' s such a
building and why there were so  di   man  so many uh different
types of people
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
ruled uh this country and i i  ' ve
 
""
uhm 
""
""
i  ' m quite new about the the the name normans
 
""
yeah yeah   yeah  
""
""
 uh   romans because i don't think uh in britain
there  there were so many different   era  in the past
 
""
 yeah yeah  
""
different groups of people   coming  in
""
you were both in lancaster 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yah
 
""
yeah  ah 
""
""
uhm
 
""
what was the weather like
""
was it good 
""
""
i can say that uh the weather is just like women
 
""
oh what does that mean   so  
""
""
 nothing   to tell
 
""
nothing   to  tell 
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
yeah 
""
""
i think so
""
same feeling
 
""
same feeling 
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 yeah   
""
""
before that i i i didn't believe that saying but after i have
been to lancaster i believe so
 
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah
""
""
  sometimes 
 
""
 get  
""
you can't describe it 
""
""
cannot
 
""
no you can't describe it 
""
""
and sometimes my feeling will be affected by the bad weather
""
for example uh uh there was a trip to  two words
 victorian fair and   remember 
""
""
 it was   raining
""
""
yeah it rained heavily
 
""
yah 
""
""
and we can't enjoy  ourself  quite much because we
have   to go  inside the shop   because of the  rain
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm   
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 yeah   yeah yeah okay
""
so when you came back from uh lancaster and all that bad weather
did you did you see anything different in hong kong 
""
""
yeah especially the pace of life
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uhm  tut  well in fact uhm  tut  something i i
have a very strong feeling about is uhm when  tut  the amount of the
assignments uh yeah that  ' s that  ' s very terrible and uhm
 
""
where was this
""
in lancaster 
""
""
yah   but  uh it  ' s very unnecessary
""
and uhm i  ' ve talked to my lectures uh but they  s  they
said uhm they were sorry and they could not do anything and
 
""
 yeah  
""
uhm 
""
""
well uhm  tut  but i i think uhm   may  be
the students in hong kong they are used to uhm the examination   system
""
""
and they just do and do and do and without asking why
 
""
 some  
""
 yeah  
""
so you but but you are still talking about lancaster that you had
too many assignments to do 
""
""
yeah   because  the   the  hong kong uh
uhm the hong kong education department asked them to give us   so much
 assignments
 
""
 yeah  
""
 what what  
""
 aw i see  
""
  so  they were obliged to that
""
did   did  you feel the same
""
patrick were   you  
""
""
 so  
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah   yeah
 
""
  yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
and what what what effect did the do do you think you could have
got more out of the whole of out of the course if you had not had so many
assignments
""
do you think you would have enjoyed enjoy yourself more or 
""
""
sure
 
""
see more about the culture and   yeah  
""
""
 yah  
""
""
uhm uhm uhm yeah but uhm  the uhm for me   uhm 
i enjoy the life in lancaster university   because  i quite often
went to the gym to do some exercise
 
""
 oh  
""
 uhm  
""
uh workout 
""
""
and in hong kong uh although i i  ' m in the tertiary education
but in the college there  ' s no such a big gym for me to   to do 
what i would like to   do 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah   the college don't have a big gym 
""
""
yeah uhm not much not many activities uh i feel interested in
 
""
right 
""
""
uhm
""
""
yeah
""
so assignment is a problem
 
""
uhm   uhm  
""
""
 it  ' s   a problem for me and but on the other
hand uh i enjoyed the facilities that this university   that  can
provide
 
""
 okay  
""
yeah yeah so when when you came back you said charlotte that the
pace of life is different is very different 
""
""
yeah
 
""
uhm   what  what what struck you immediately
""
what was the first thing you you noticed that about hong kong 
  coming back  
 #>  well  
""
 well uhm    tut  we in hong kong we we cannot
have any spare time to do what we like   and  uh but uh when we
were in lancaster uh i i found that i  ' ve got sometime to practice my guitar
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yeah 
""
""
yah during the evenings
 
""
did you take a guitar with you 
""
""
no uh they  ' ve got two guitars
 
""
ah okay good 
""
""
and i borrowed one of this uh
 
""
from the course 
""
""
no uh from my host family
 
""
all right right right   yeah  
""
""
 and   uhm well i i kept the guitar for for almost
a month
 
""
uhm uhm
""
and did you get better
""
did you improve 
""
""
yah
 
""
yah 
""
""
yah   uhm 
 
""
 that  ' s   good 
""
""
 tut  in fact i haven't played it for for nine years
almost
 
""
aw
""
well that  ' s a long time
""
so patrick what about you when you came back
""

""
""
uhm
 
""
when you got back 
""
""

""
""
very much
 
""
did did you get that feeling when you were in kai tak or  
walk   over  to kai tak yeah 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah uhm because uh i think uh i  i could not have uhm the best
food in england
 
""

""
""
yeah
 
""
so you didn't like the food as much as charlotte as like the food
""

""
yeah   so  got good food did you 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
  yeah 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""

 a few words  after a   month  in lancaster 
""
""
 yeah  
""
really
 
""
eating chips
""
uh huh good
""
right so you  ' re you  ' re back in hong kong do do you feel under a
lot of pressure 
""
""
uh in hong kong
 
""
yah  at the college   didn't  you feel under
pressure 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah
 
""
yeah 
""
""
a lot
 
""
work 
""
""
uhm the killing assignments
 
""
yeah 
""
""
and uhm well i have to get back to my job and uhm  tut
 it  ' s very tiresome
 
""
or job 
""
""
as a private tutor well in in fact it isn't a bad job at all
and uh i like the child but uhm the fact is that uhm it spend you so much
time
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
cost so much time and   uhm   tut  whenever
you get home uhm you will be very tired
 
""
 yeah  
""
uhm how many times do you see your student 
""
""
five times a week
 
""
five times a week 
""
""
yes
 
""
why  one-word  and how from when to when is a
different different   day  
""
""
 well   from half past five uhm but uhm well i
have to stay for at least an hour everyday and
 
""
yeah okay 
""
""
it depends
 
""
so you go through the child  ' s homework and 
""
""
yah
 
""
and help in  var  different subjects 
""
""
yeah
 
""
english maths all these and 
""
""
all subjects
 
""
all subjects ah
""
and you spent an hour 
""
""
at least an hour   everyday 
 
""
 at least   an hour
""
sometimes is more 
""
""
yeah
 
""
yeah
""
and what about you patrick
""
do you have any extra extra work    on the  go 
""
""
""
 yes   yes
""
uh i  ' m busy of doing my homework   and  i  ' m i  ' m also
a private tutor uh for two young  p  uh pupil
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
in primary school
""
and
 
""
how often do you see them 
""
""
 t  twice a week   third  times a week
""
it depends
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
right 
""
""
if if he wants uh preparing his   examination  so i
had to go quite frequently
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
okay 
""
""
and so i  th  the pressure i think it  ' s from college
assignment
 
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah
""
  it  ' s  quite demanding   in  in the third
year
 
""
 where do  
""
 but  
""
but do you think that just imagine if the college had no
assignment
""
if the college said you don't have to do anything 
""
""
uh uh
 
""
you can just attend the classes and you  ' ll get your certificate
at the end do you think that would be good honestly 
""
""
 tut  ]
""
""
no
 
""
no 
""
""
no uh for the uhm i think it would be better if uhm the
lessons are were a bit shorter
""
  and then  we can have much time to do our assignments
 
""
 uh huh  
""
ah so you mean how you mean short you mean stopping early in the
day or each lesson may be only thirty five forty minutes   follow 
the 
""
""
 both  
 
""
both oh  child  
""
""
i  ' m very honest
 
""
you are very honest yeah or very lazy or both 
""
""
both
 
""
and what about you pat 
""
""
sometimes uh i  ' ll i will read some magazine in the library
and i think at that time i think if i do not get so many assignment to do my
school life in the college will be much better
 
""
right   because you  have the chance to read and 
   broaden your knowledge and yah 
""
""
 i can read  
""
 yeah  
""
and i quite often make a plan for me    and  uh try
to keep a promise uh with myself  
""
 uhm  
""
okay 
""
""
for example uh i plan i try to  p  plan uh one i  w
 if i had  ti  had i if i had the time i would read uh some
magazine  t  twice a week in   the library    or 
spend uh two hours in the library twice a week but i you finally i could it
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
you can't do   it yeah  
""
""
 but i can't   do it
 
""
  right  
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
yeah i think that  ' s the same with everyone
""
uh i think people of serious problems
""
and teachers a well you are going into a profession and teachers
are killing themselves in hong kong 
""
""
uhm
""
""
yah
 
""
is   that uhm  
""
""
 yah yah  
 
""
yeah
""
when you were on teaching practice did you feel any any of that
kind of pressure 
""
""
yeah very much
 
""
really 
""
""
yah uh i can i could only sleep for uhm  tut  about
four hours everyday during my tp period
 
""
really 
 yah
 
""
why what what what were you doing 
""
""
writing my lesson plans
 
""
but these teachers don't have lesson plans because they are real
teachers and they don't need lesson plans but because you are not real
teacher
""
uhm so why do you think they are under so much pressure teachers
in hong kong 
""
""
the workload   and  uhm sometimes uhm the students
are very naughty and uhm the worse is that uhm many of the parents they they
are not co-operative
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
right 
""
""
they blame that on the teachers   uh  if their
children were badly behaved uhm they they will claim that uh it  ' s the
responsibility of the teachers
 
""
 uhm  
""
okay yeah
""
and it  ' s that your experience also patrick 
""
""
uh not as much as pressure   with  charlotte yeah
my pressure mainly come from what i observe during the tp period
 
""
 yeah  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uh yes definitely there are is some pressure on  d  uh
on my tp uh on my teaching practice
 
""
right just preparation 
""
""
yeah but i i think is is worst uh not myself but the the
original teachers   and so  yeah
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
you saw them under   pressure  
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
they they do not have any free lesson at all 
""
 uh 
 
""
 right   right 
""
""
only two free lesson in a in a whole week
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and for me during the teaching practice i i have uh  t
 ten free lesson   a  week   so  i feel much better
 
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
right 
""
""
but i think if i were the teacher in this school uh yeah if i
feel i  ' m working under  ve    under  very heavy work
loading
 
""
 uhm  
""
but that  ' s what both of you are going to be doing next year 
""
""
yeah
 
""
this time next year you are going to be teachers    
in schools
""
how do you think you will cope 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
well uhm i haven't thought about that
""
  just  do it
 
""
 uhm  
""
just do it 
""
""
i have a  psycholo  psychological preparation and i
learn form the news uh one secondary teacher kill himself   because
 uh of because of uh the uhm pressure from his work
 
""
 uhm  
""
yup 
""
""
and i learn from it because i know if i were  h  i
were him i would try my best to to uh release my pressure in a way for
example uh call my friend and to play ballgames   once  a week and
talk with my friend sharing my feeling    with  my friends
 
""
 right  
""
 are you  
""
can i ask are you close enough to someone to share that kind of
feeling 
""
""
yes
 
""
yeah
""
  you  you  ' ve got friends who are closes enough 
 that  you could go and say i  ' ve got serious problems at work 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yeah
 
""
can i have a cup of coffee or tea and can we talk   about
 and yah 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yah
 
""
so you  ' ve you can do that 
""
""
yah   i always have  such friends
 
""
 both of you yeah  
""
oh that  ' s good yeah
""
 fr fr  since when 
""
""
since well my secondary life
 
""
uhm uhm
""
and are they as odd as you   b laughs 
 
""
you said that you are   odd  
""
""
 no   they are very normal
 
""
they are very normal
""
you are the one that  ' s odd 
""
""
yeah
 
""
what about you patrick
""
have uh have you got close friends   that you can  yah
""
""
""
 yes   yes i often play squash badminton
 
""
uhm 
""
""
once a week with them and after the  ga  ballgames i
quite often talk with them for an hour
 
""
yeah 
""
""
  yeah  so uhm much much pressure could be released
 
""
 yeah  
""
just from that 
""
""
yeah
 
""
once a week that kind of activity   yeah  uhm
""
and what about the children when you were in school
""
do you thin the kids are under pressure as well 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yes
 
""
yeah 
""
""
yup
 
""
the one that you are teaching 
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
 
""
primary 
""
""
yah
 
""
uh huh
""
they must you doing your private tuition you must realise that
you got that girl for was it 
""
""
uh that boy
 
""
the boys sorry
""

""
""
yeah
 
""
at least an hour

""
""
