""
""

""

""
and now i  ' m busy in preparing my final examinations
""
and finding  uh my first career
""
""
  oh  
""
""
 yes  
""
my major study is chinese language
""
and for years uhm those who are major their study in this subject
""
tend to go to the teaching field
""
and most probably
""
i would also take it as my first career
""
""
yes
 
""
do you say that with any enthusiasm
""
 wo  would you like that
""
or  would you   hoping for  something else 
""
""
 actually    i  ' m not sure
""
and that  ' s that  ' s the problem
""
i  ' m i don't know whether  tut  this job is suitable for me
or not
""
uhm in other words
""
i don't know whether  i  ' m able to  take up  this as my
post
""
could you share your experience with us  all speakers laugh 
 
""
it  ' s  one-word 
""
uhm  i  sup 
""
what we had to do before
""
learning to teach was spent two weeks in a primary   
school
""
to  see how we go on with they  with the situation
""
uh you can tell whether or not you like the teaching
""
but i then concentrated on uh   several words
    
""
secondary and tertiary    
""
you may try that
""
visit your own school
""
and ask if they can when let you to take the class the first form
""
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 but uh  
""
uhm uhm
""
""
what is your first job
""
is it  uhm teaching
 
""
teaching 
""
""
oh well
""
""
in hong kong
 
""
no
""
i  ' m  comparatively new comer to hong kong
""
i  ' ve been here for nearly four years     only
""
otherwise i was in england 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
do you come across any difficulties in uhm teaching
 
""
yes  all speakers laugh 
""
students   here  
""
you mean hong kong students 
""
""
 some yes  
""
hong kong student
 
""
well
""
you are asking me question
""
and looking at me very friendly fashionly and no problem
""
but a lot of student particularly in the class
""
nearly notice in your   class were  not response
""
do not participate
""
and   it  ' s  very frustrating
""
  because  it is my job  to get you  to
response say things
""
to ask me questions
""
to say if you don't like doing something
""
and do something else
""
that is frustrated 
""
""
 yes uhm  
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
""
it  ' s common  pheno  phenomenon  hong kong students
uh don't talk much in the   class 
""
 es  especially in english
""
  in a foreign  language
""
and uhm 
""
maybe  they find it difficult to     talk or
communicate with teacher in english
""
because the teacher doesn't know how to  talk in cantonese
""
""
 yes  
""
 yes yes  
""
yeah
 
""
 uhm  
""
but of course the object is that
""
i  ' ve even i couldn't speak cantonese
""
  i wasn't  
""
""
 uh uh uh  
""
uh uh
""
do you know cantonese
""
""
uh ha
 
""
a few words only  all speakers laugh  
""
""
you like uh  teaching in hong kong
 
""
i love it
""
yes i do
""
despite the  frustration but they
""
  the  students the students are by large entirely
pleasant  and friendly    
""
i was just  like them to be more actively involved
""
uh but no it  ' s it  ' s fine
""
i enjoy the university 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
but i think it  ' s  quite  di 
""
uh it  ' s quite different
""
uhm to teach in university and teach in secondary school  
 
""
because i think the  workload would be uhm  tut  much
greater
""
uhm to teach in secondary school
""
and you have to face uh quite a lot of student
 
""
 yes  
""
yes 
""
""
besides the administrative work  will be   tut 
very much i think
""
so that  ' s the problem
 
""
yes
""
and this is what you  ' re  contemplating 
""
""
yes
 
""
have you any alternatives 
""
""
uhm  actually i  tut 
""
uhm  i will go to the appointment service to see whether
""
uhm some jobs will be suitable for me or not
""
and i apply for some  but uhm
 
""
  such as  
""
""
 such    such as uhm
""
uhm  manage uhm
""
management trainee or  uhm  or something like that
""
but there  ' s no  reply  all speakers laugh 
 
""
so far 
""
""
yes so far
 
""
keep applying 
""
""
yes
""
""
uhm i also apply uhm  some jobs uhm
""
uh for example the  government uh
""
government jobs like uh administrative    execu  
officer   
""
but  fail  all speakers laugh 
""
""
 officer  
""
so do i
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
and i    al  
 
""
 fail   why
""
but you you  ' ve call for   interviews or what
""
what do they want  
""
""
 because  there  there are   a lot of
candidates     available for the government
""
and they can choose best    
""
uhm  maybe my uhm  my  uhm 
""
my major curriculum is not uh  suitable for the job  
 
""
and uhm i have apply some private companies
""
but uhm  i i don't have much confidence
""
because uhm i think the companies want to have uh  the business
students
""
not the arts students    
""
so i will try keeping applying
""
but i i don't know whether i can find a job 
 laughs  in the private company
""
or in   business  field
""
i i my alternative is teaching
""
but i find it different because
""
my major is english   but  my english is not very
good  all speakers laugh 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh ha  
""
 yeah  
""
uh
""
uh maybe you  ' ll been modest there
""
they need  teachers still in in hong kong
""
lot of vacant in papers
""
  isn't  it isn't it a good job is it
""
does it attractive 
""
""
 yes  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 my  
""
teaching
 
""
teaching yes
""
does it well paid 
""
""
well   paid 
""
""
 well   paid
 
""
  it is  yeah 
""
""
 but    but maybe uh 
""
it  ' s  sta 
""
it is stable
""
it  ' s the stable career but uhm 
""
you can't expect much uh    prospect    
""
and uh   i think uhm 
""
though though my english is not very good
""
but if i teach the students i can 
""
i well uhm  understand the    pro   their
difficulties   or  problems
""
because i have encountered before
""
uhm uhm
""
""
 prospect  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
i have apply for the government post too such as uhm
""
 admin  administrative officer executive officer
""
and we have to sit for examination
""
but the examination last from  uhm morning to afternoon
""
it  ' s   very long 
""
""
  un  until   five  o'clo  five
o'clock
""
""
  five  o'clock
""
it  ' s very extensive
""
and  tut  the question is quite  uhm difficult
""
  and so 
""
it  ' s tricky
 
""
 oh   
""
""
 it  ' s tricky  
 
""
oh is it all  written 
""
""
yes
 
""
no oral     test 
""
""
 uhm  
""
no
""
uh after you  sit for the examination
""
and they stream out all  all  uh all the  all
""
stream out the best and they sit for an interview
""
""
interview
""
""
yes
 
""
but the written examination  last most of the day 
""
""
yes
""
because   there  are altogether four   
papers 
""
""
 yes  
""
 four papers  
""
yes
""
and my performance is not very good
""
actually i don't want to go for this exam
""
because the duration is too   long 
""
and you got exhausted  
 laughs  in it
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yes yes 
""
""
sometimes it  ' s it  ' s not difficult but  uhm  tut 
""
you don't want to write anything
""
it  ' s it  ' s uhm  tut 
""
you got tired when you  write from morning to   afternoon
""
""
it  ' s really extensive
 
""
 uhm  
""
how did you keep your  interest going  there 
""
what do you have to write about
""
what were your tasks 
""
""
uhm
""
one paper is uhm
""
testing your comprehension of english    
""
there are as uh an closed uh passage   
""
uh  something like   that 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm uhm  
""
 filling   in the gaps 
""
""
yes    
""
and another paper is testing your  chinese    
""
such as writing uh uh you you play in a situation
""
you are a executive member
""
for example you face you face a problem
""
  and  you have to solve the problem and you write
something
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 yes  
""
you got to uh write an essay uh in cantonese and english both
""
""
uh ha
 
""
  solving  solving  problem 
""
""
 solve the problem  
""
yes in a situation
 
""
have you heard any  training in that at all 
""
""
no
 
""
no
""
whereas from some faculties
""
there would have some training
""
problems solving or the subject they would study 
""
""
but the examination is  uhm open to  all the graduates
""
so  tut  uhm student will tend to apply for it
""
no matter uhm we can uh pass or not
""
""
we will apply for it
""
it  ' s free of charge 
 laughs 
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 is it   
""
""
yes
 
""
it  ' s unusual in hong kong 
 laughs  
""
""
and uhm
""
and one more paper testing your numerial skills
""
uh  a lot of numbers a lot   of  uhm  questions on
uh mathematics
""
you have
""
this  ' s my  uh worst paper
""
""
 yes  
 
""
well i think just uh  all speakers laugh 
""
what about you
""
  are you  good at maths 
""
""
 uhm  
""
no
 
""
you are not 
""
""
very bad  all speakers laugh 
""
""
because uhm after  form five in secondary school
""
so we have no mathematics papers
""
uhm uhm
""
""
in this paper
""
uhm it provide us many tables
""
that is full of figures
""
and then you ask some questions
""
uhm  it  ' s to choose one answer from a b c d
""
but  i think all the answer  uhm are are correct
""
so 
 laughs  i don't know how to choose it
""
because uhm  my mathematics is not very good 
 laughs 
 
""
what did you do
""
close your eyes and pick one 
""
""
sometimes  all speakers laugh 
 
""
you  ' ve got twenty-five percent  chance   don't you
 
""
""
 yes  
""
  from a to d 
 
""
  one-word  just four  
""
yes 
""
""
at least you got a chance
 
""
so you don't mind
""
going in for an exam like that
""
although clearly you haven't been prepared for it
""
  you don't mind
""
you thought  you just try 
""
""
 uhm uhm uhm
""
uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
 
""
so what  ' s the next thing you are going to do 
""
""
the next thing
 
""
are you going to look at the  schools
""
or you  con  going to continue applying to  companies
""
""
""
uh both i think
""
because uhm  uh
""
after the examinations will we
""
if we  cannot get a job
""
we we have to  lock  at look in the newspapers to find uh
 the application
""
uhm both are advertised in newspaper
 
""
will you look in the south china morning post 
""
""
uh
""
""
but i think chinese newspaper provides us  uhm
""
more post in   teaching 
""
but for the others in business field
""
perhaps the scmp   will  provide a lot
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
what sort of job  would you look for  in the business field
""
how do you read an advertisement and think
""
uh i can do that
""
what your 
""
""
  in fact 
 
""
 personnel   or what 
""
""
i  ' m not familiar with the post
""
for example executive trainee
""
i  ' m not sure what  ' s the   tasks  or  the
characteristics of the  position is
 
""
 uhm  
""
neither am i 
""
""
yes because the description of the job is very brief
 
""
yeah 
""
""
so you you you you can't know whether  what it is 
saying  in this  short words
""
and most probably we look at the requirement to see whether
""
we are suitable for or or not
""
if we are suitable
""
and  we  have to say or ask uh the others opinion
""
and if we think it  ' s not bad
""
we apply for it
 
""
if it says
""
you need at least form five
""
but it doesn't mention university    degree 
""
would you apply
""
or you think  they were  pigeon  at too low 
""
""
 uhm uhm yes  
""
  i think  i won't
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
no
""
would you 
""
""
depends on the salary  all speakers laughs 
""
""
but i think if  its requirement is say that
""
uhm form five level it  ' s salary range is will not  be too high
""
  is it 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm
 
""
what salary range would you expect 
""
""
i think
 
""
what is what  ' s reasonable  for  fresh graduates 
""
""
around ten thousand
""
""
uhm uhm
""
yes
""
i think so  a long pause 
 
""
so this is what occupying most of your thoughts    
now 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes
 
""
are you worry at all about the exam that  ' s uh are coming up 
""
""
yes
""
my examination timetable is very bad
""
uh i can i start from third of  third of june
""
third forth  four five six
""
and then last to twenty-six of june
""
it  ' s very  uh  i don't know how to say
""
i i can i can't get uhm  time to rest
 
""
yes you have too much altogether 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
eight papers   altogether 
 
""
 yeah  
""
yes yeah
""
what uh papers are you take besides english 
""
""
chinese
 
""
oh yes you said you   said 
""
alright
""
if you are get uh
""
well as just subject
""
you are going to get a summer job 
 laughs  
""
""
 uhm  
""
no
 
""
in june for a few weeks 
""
and you got the same programme
""
you  ' re doing 
""
""
uhm my major study is chinese   language
""
and minor  study is chinese history
""
so my timetable is different from her
 
""
 yes china chinese  
""
you  ' re not doing english 
""
""
no
 
""
oh you  ' re not
""
i thought how 
""
is it you two involved in this project 
""
""
yes
""
  this is  my friend 
 laughs 
""
and   i just help her 
 
""
 this she  
""
 oh just friend   and help her 
""
""
yes
""
both of you are nice  all speakers laugh 
 
""
there we are
""
alright
""
i understand i was making assumption 
""
""
my timetable is good
""
it  ' s uhm the examination uh will start from  the fourth of
june to twenty-four june
""
but uhm  i  ' m still worry about  this examination as compare
with last year
""
because uhm i think  uhm the courses of this year  is uhm
more complicated
""
and most of them uhm  need to use much time to  uhm study it
 
""
give me an example 
""
""
example   
""
especially  uhm chinese history
""
uhm last year uhm  uhm
""
the courses is easy
""
you just uhm  uh read it
""
and you could uhm  uhm
""
and you could have uhm good result i think
""
but now you have to uhm make much uhm explanation and elaborate
the problems
""
and so the difference is in it
""
so perhaps uhm  you have read it uh for many times
""
but  if your opinions or your point is not good
""
uhm you will get low grade
""
that is the great   problem 
 
""
 it  ' s a more kind of  
""
 i see   i see
""
do you find that  your subject  more difficult 
""
""
yes more  diff    icult  than the  pas
 than the past year
""
for example i take uhm common vision common vision
""
common vision in modern drama
 
""
common vision 
""
""
comic vision
""
  comic comic comic vision 
 
""
 comic
""
oh comic comic vision  
""
right 
""
""
and the play  is a very difficult
""
for example  samuel baskets  
""
  waiting for all  doll
 
""
 waiting for  
""
wait 
 laughs  
""
""
i don't know what they are talking about
 
""
what is
""
even uh english people don't either 
""
""
yes uh 
 laughs 
""
but the yes
""
but but talkings are very assert assert
 
""
it is assert yes 
""
""
uhm
""
but uhm
""
most of the plays uh actually all the plays
""
the lecturer interpret as comedy
""
i don't found they are comedy
 
""
i am going to ask you
""
why   waiting   for all doll  as  tut  a
comedy
""
can you explain
""
what did he say 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uh it  ' s talk about life
""
it  ' s talk about life
""
somehow you keeps waiting
""
for example you have a lot of work to do
""
you you  ' re you sitting at the home
""
and always worry about i have a lot of work to do
""
uh first second   fourth  third   fourth
""
""
but you still looking at  television    
""
and don't move    
""
and the plays is also uh display that what uh  godo  go go
and godo 
""
always waiting and they say
""
let  ' s go now don't wait for  godo 
""
  but  they don't move
""
  still  stay there
""
  maybe   that  ' s  that  ' s the main theme
""
but i  don't find it  laugh
""
don't find it  uh funny    
""
i don't find funny
""
and  other plays such as uhm   chery obsture  
  
""
i i  uh  checkcops    
""
 chery  obsture 
""
and i found it  ' s   tragedy 
""
but the lecturer say it  ' s comedy 
 laughs 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 funny  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 yes  
""
comedy 
""
""
uh ha
 
""
  uh ha  
""
""
 and   it  ' s uh right it is a tragedy
""
and i explain it
""
of course i will get a low low grade
""
but 
 laughs   she she doesn't
""
she doesn't  uhm say anything uhm  to us
""
uh that uh we have to write it uh
""
it is a comedy or comic vision
""
so far you can give your examination
""
you think it  ' s a tragedy
""
and you found a lot of reference
""
all the reference nearly all the reference  say it is a tragedy
   
""
but uhm  i i think it  ' s quite difficult
""
because i can't uhm  grasp the  the techniques or skills in
 studying this
 
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
""
but do you
""
can i just go back over what you  ' ve said
""
you  you don't have to accept the view of the lecturer
""
  you you  can say it   a tragedy 
""
  you justify it  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 but she  
""
she said uh i
""
we can't we can't uh say our view   our   
opinions 
 
""
 yeah  
""
yeah 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
but whenever we say it out in our tutorial
""
she object
 
""
uh
""
so you are you understood the 
 laughs  
""
""
uhm i think it  ' s quite uh dictate  dictatorship 
 and
 laugh 
 
""
dictatorship 
""
""
but had  had your tutor or lecturer uhm  help you to
use different angles to see   the 
""
""
 no  
""
she said if she  ' s  she uh said uh the elements in the  
tra  uhm
""
if she say it out to us
""
uh we will copy  copy her opinions
""
we should think   
""
she  said uh it  ' s the
""
it  ' s the role for her to give us direction
""
but not the answer
""
no model answer for  any literature courses
""
so it  ' s quite difficult
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
uhm 
""
""
somehow i found myself from  to  her opinion
""
quite different
""
  uh it  ' s  involuntary
""
""
 uh yes  
 
""
yeah   yeah 
""
just thought it for a strong character 
""
""
 uhm  
""
  uhm uhm 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
and i think
""
uh most probably the plays  are related with uhm  foreign
culture and literature    
""
  and  chinese student    might  be
difficult to understand
""
""
 uh uh  
 
""
 uhm   
""
 uhm  
""
""
yes
""
whatever i   read
""
i  i read certain  com  comic story    
""
i don't i don't laugh  all speakers laugh 
""
because i don't understand what they talking about
""
maybe  this     difference of culture
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
uhm
""
i  ' m sure translating humour  into another language must be
very difficult 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm
""
it  ' s quite different from tragedy
""
uhm for example romeo and juliet
""
and  add  one from different cultures will   maybe
""
 
""
 understand   it 
""
""
they will sad   
""
they  will understand
""
but comedy is different
 
""
 yes yes  
""
yes yes 
""
""
but why do you choose this course 
 and
 laugh 
""
""
because i
""
  last  last year i take tragedy    
""
  and  in fact it  ' s a continuation of the course
