<I>
race two of the night at happy valley and good chance is a
heavily backed favourite 
he ' s in the dark pale blue colours two point six in betting 
as much as three to one in the earlier part of the night 
he ' s down to thirteen to eight now 
second up this season douglas white rode the first winner here this
evening for john moore and viking dancer 
he ' ll try and ride one for alex wong now 
provide him with the second of the season 
okay we ' re just about set 
good chance has drawn the inside 
we ' re about to dispatch the field now 
they ' re set now ready racing 
and missing the start the newcomer flying bishop arabica not a
great deal of speed 
wide out lombard jumped fast 
there ' s capital star burning to join him 
mascot quick into stride settled third 
followed by good chance the rails famous brand wide out then
jamieson 
the rest struggling to go the speed at the moment 
hennessy star then inspired from flying bishop arabica 
quest for luck and twin wizards is last 
capital star shooting underneath lombard and they are the joint
leaders at the five hundred metre mark 
mascot running third 
good chance fourth followed then by famous brand jamieson 
well back to hennessy star arabica improves the rails 
further back to inspired and next of the rest is flying bishop
capital star lombard turn together 
capital star the inside of lombard 
good chance starting to put in then mascot 
lombard ' s swept to the front 
good chance the danger though 
quickly good chance raced up to lombard 
then capital star mascot arabica from a long way back 
but good chance is drawing clear now of lombard 
arabica late on the scene might get third but good chance wins
easily 
good chance first lombard second 
arabica snatched third in front of capital star 
then mascot flying bishop made up a lot of ground 
from jamison then hennessy star inspired twin wizards 
further back to famous brand and quest for luck at the rear of the
field 
easy win to the favourite good chance 
number two good chance first 
drawing right away from lombard who was short in the market and
arabica has come from well back 
to grab third on the line 
two ten and eight the placings 
two ten and eight 
good chance lombard and arabica 
taking out race number two 
capital star worked hard there with lombard 
actually lombard ' s fought on quite well when you concede uh how he
dropped right out of proceedings at sha tin in his first run 
he ' s shown a lot more bottom here tonight lombard 
uh by holding second 
he clearly got the upper hand on capital star 
mascot trailed them 
he was in the box seat but normally mascot ' s in the role of making
the speed and uh invariably he seems to fight on better when he ' s done more
work in the run 
so two ten one they finish we await the final pay out 
he was very heavily punted good chance he ' s going to return around
twenty six dollars 
we ' ll see if you get the extra fifty cents 
lombard was around a six or seven to one chance and number eight
arabica 
a little bit of value there at twelve to one 
now twenty six dollars the pay out for good chance 
fifteen dollars fifty a place 
number ten lombard twenty nine dollars fifty 
and thirty three fifty about number eight arabica 
the quinella one eighty one fifty 
one eighty one fifty 
and the tierce about to be assembled 
it was a big win 
two and a quarter by threequarters 
two and a quarter by threequarters 
the gallop fifty eight two 
it ' s outside standard and a fairway outside my honours class
record as well 
as you see fading in the background the tierce returned at two
thousand three hundred and seventy one dollars 
two thousand three hundred and seventy one 
well there ' s a riding double to douglas white he booted home
viking dancer in the first 
and uh that horse of course trained by john moore the winner by
alex wong 
but john moore trained the runner up lombard who ' s definitely
improved from the first up run john egan 
and arabica third stephen baster for derek cruz 
fourth home was number one being capital star 
so fifty eight two the time recorded by good chance he showed a lot
of promise here uh last week 
the amount of work he did over the twelve hundred metres 
he stepped back a furlong tonight 
trailed the speed all of the way 
pulled out at the right time and it ' s been a very easy win for the
favourite 
taking out race two here tonight at happy valley 
 commercial break 
as runners return and the owners come out it ' s uh a
favourites race the second good chance winning it 
it ' s paid twenty six and fifteen fifty 
yes that ' s right twenty six dollars 
he was thirty five before uh when uh looked at the horses in the
parade ring 
then he got down to twenty nine as they loaded into the gates 
and uh everyone kept running to the windows and uh putting their
money on him 
and the twenty six dollar favourite ' s home for the punters 
the quinellas paid one eighty one fifty 
with a brave run by lombard who was up pressuring the front runner
all of the way 
and hence capital star missed because cap capital star was the
horse on the fence 
in the lead with lombard 
capital star was burst open and that made it a little bit easier
for good chance 
and as for this jockey douglas white the demon is on fire 
that ' s two out of two for the night 
we ' ve seen him been riding so well for so long 
as we look at the close photo for third it ' s actually nearly a
neck on the wire there 
he really pounced on capital star 
he was finishing off very strongly indeed wasn't he 
uh mascot always held about the same position just lacks a kick
over a thousand metres doesn't he but i don't think he lost anything 
in that defeat here tonight i ' d be happy enough to keep him on my
side again when he goes back to twelve or fourteen hundred at sha tin 
isn't it amazing the depth of riders we ' ve got here uh the
way this guy dominated last season and uh for for what i know he ' s the only
guy that ' s lead from the first meeting and never been headed for the
premiership 
i believe even in the old days when uh moore and basil and a few
of those guys won premierships 
i was told by a few of the old scribes that they had been headed
early on in the season 
what about robbie when he won two seasons ago was he headed
as well was he 
i think in the mid i think in the middle stages somebody got
level with him 
but he also basically lead all of the way 
ready racing 
and missing the start the newcomer flying bishop arabica not a
great deal of speed 
wide out lombard jumped fast 
there ' s capital star burning to join him 
mascot quick into stride settled third 
followed by good chance the rails famous brand wide out then
jamieson 
the rest struggling to go the speed at the moment 
hennessy star then inspired from flying bishop arabica 
quest for luck and twin wizards is last 
capital star shooting underneath lombard and they are the joint
leaders at the five hundred metre mark 
mascot running third 
good chance fourth followed then by famous brand jamieson 
well back to hennessy star arabica improves the rails 
further back to inspired and next of the rest is flying bishop
capital star lombard turn together 
capital star the inside of lombard 
good chance starting to put in then mascot 
lombard ' s swept to the front 
good chance the danger though 
quickly good chance raced up to lombard 
then capital star mascot arabica from a long way back 
but good chance is drawing clear now of lombard 
arabica late on the scene might get third but good chance wins
easily 
yes good chance winning it ' s officially two and a quarter
threequarters between second and third 
favourite at fifteen fifty twenty nine fifty 
you saw the q and the t and the trio dividend paid six hundred and
seven dollars for race number two on the programme 
uh the uh quinella place dividends seventy dollars fifty sixty
two fifty with arabica 
and the second and third horses two hundred and thirty six dollars
they ' re the q t dividends out of the way 
and the douglas white dubbed races one and two 
paid one hundred and twenty nine dollars fifty 
the first one paid fifty dollars fifty 
and that one paid twenty six 
the consolation seventy eight dollars 
the stewards patrol 
don't blink 
no you ' ll certainly miss him the uh youngster or uh the new
horse here uh was slow away flying bishop 
as he had been in his uh barrier trials so he obviously needs the
experience but the other horse far from it 
famous brand working his way across from gate eleven 
i was actually quite encouraged 
he was niggled along to stay there and not surprisingly it took
its toll in the closing stages 
but ah i was more or less happy with the way he ' s managed to
perform here tonight 
you can see that lombard has uh really made sure that uh capital
star didn't have everything his own way 
in the end of it he ' s forced capital star to do just a little bit
too much 
mascot took that box seat in behind and then the eventual winner
sat up against the rails in fourth place 
and you can see that douglas white already just starting to ease
him out to get off the heels 
he doesn't want to be caught uh trying to go up the inside 
no point in trying to be clever when you think you ' ve got enough
under the tank already 
and you can see he hasn't really got serious with this horse and
he ' s just lengthening out 
all the way down to the line 
he ' s just picking up lombard now 
douglas white doesn't need to go and use his stick 
he ' s uh just pulled it through to show him there i don't call
that a smack behind the saddle 
that was a pretty cosy win and a horse who looks like he ' s going
the right way 
the uh overall time in that race mark was fifty eight point
two the sectional break down 
the thirteen one then from the eight hundred metres twenty two 
and the final quarter recorded in twenty three point one 
that overall time is two tenths outside standard 
 commercial break 
well the first race has already been run here this evening
and we can now review the action in that with our caller darren flindell
ready to run uh 
gates released 
they ' re off
uh favourite spartan was one of the last to leave with classic
choice and indian taipan 
viking dancer began well 
so did reputation and holy quest is coming over from floral region
and optic chief as they go into the first bend 
classic choice trying to muster now from beloved partner 
darley ' s got a nice run along the rails 
then money star from spartan rainbow seeker and indian taipan
settles at the rear 
about twelve hundred metres to go and holy quest presses on now
he ' ll give viking dancer some cover 
optic chief third on the outside of reputation then floral regent
beloved partner no luck from the deep draw 
three wide around classic choice and darley on the fence
