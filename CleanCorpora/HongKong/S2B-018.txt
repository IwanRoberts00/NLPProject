a working relationship with china is not something we in hong
kong  can afford to see turned on and turned off according to political
need or diplomatic whims or editorial pressure

for we the people of hong kong  have to live with the
consequences  continued by daphne tse and a speech by baroness chalker

elected seat in nineteen ninety-five

whether we should get  it at the end of the day is another
matter

what baroness dunn said in her speech

uhm i think that it  ' s no  dou  doubt about it that we are
going through a very crucial period in our development  and it is very
important  that we try to uhm limit or eliminate  uhm as far as
possible the differences  and uh come to some uh agreement as to  how
we should move forward

i don't think it  ' s a right right uh position for a british
government to do it

and second thing is that i think uh the basic law is the the things
belong to the chinese government

i think as a foreign countries the more active uh the british the
role play the more problem that will create
