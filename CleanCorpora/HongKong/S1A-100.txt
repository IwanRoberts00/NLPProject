<I>
 beginning of the conversation partially not recorded 
high table dinner at at school
i mean at uni
yeah from my hall
what how how often do you have that
about once a month
but i missed like every other one anyway
yeah how 
 it it was really weird
weird
yeah because it ' s uhm the ceremony thing cos they have the
hall student association so they have the new committee new cabinet coming up
so it ' s sort of these ceremony for the exchange of what 
you know 
 so it ' s a kind of formal dinner
yeah well we all have to wear this white blouse
and black long black skirt and black shoes
 and 
 a few words 
 you look a bit like waitress
and we have to wear this gown
you know like the graduation gown that you have
uh huh
but it ' s green and short sleeves
green one-word 
 with short sleeves
interesting
have you seen that movie
you must have seen that
city of glass
yeah
 yeah 
 i have seen that
 basically the the exact yeah the exact same
costume
 was was it green one-word 
oh right
yeah but then
i couldn't really remember what it look like 
 but then we don't have that like nice dinner
hall anymore
oh yeah because that ' s has been renovated hasn't it
 yeah that ' s why i have the hall
and uh anyways uhm and we will have this sort of buffet type food
so it ' s like european in style uh whatever western yeah
uh huh
but we sit round a roundtable and fork and knives and
everything and cutleries yeah
yeah but you actually sit down so it ' s not like you know
 no 
 chit chat walking around 
 no no no no no no
the ceremony takes place sort of like before dinner and then and
then you have the dinner and then th the photo taking and stuff like
that
uhm
it ' s really but it ' s really wired cos like normally we have
chinese food
uh huh
and then you have chopsticks and everything and then you just
take the food and it ' s normal you know like chinese banquet whatever
uh huh 
 yeah but if you s having western food
you kind of expect to be served or either like a buffet kind of setting so
you go out and take your food
uh uh
or you 
 is it like a family dinner though you have
 western family dinner { > you sort of pass your plates
around
 well yeah 
yeah
yeah
but then you get weird soy sauce food you know but
 but then you you still know the people at your
table right
yeah i sit with the people on my floor
yeah so but it ' s just unlike a normal like dinner you have
because it ' s more formal and you ' re sort of dressed up
well kind of yeah
uhm
i hardly ever have dinner with them anyway you know cos i ' m
hardly ever here
uh uhm
and sometimes when they cook and i happened to be here and
they see me on the corridor and they ' ll say you know you want to join us for
dinner and we ' ve got some food then i ' ll join them
so you you actually have people who made the food at your hall
it ' s a catering hall 
 no 
 no 
 no 
we have this sort of like canteen place
 right 
 right next to our hall there ' s two towers yeah
 yeah 
 you know like there ' s starr hall right next to
us there ' s a mixed hall and there ' s us right
uhm uhm
and then between the two towers there ' s this uhm ho tim hall
whatever you know the name of the place
uh huh
and on normal days it ' s a restaurant and people from belcher ' s
they come up here to have
from where
you know uhm belcher ' s the residential development 
right next to here 
 oh right yeah yeah yeah belcher ' s yeah
and anyone can go in
it ' s just like a normal fast food not fast food uhm chah
chaan teng a cantonese bistro serving chinese and
chinese-western food kind of restaurant
oh
and when it ' s our high table then we sort of like book the
whole place and then they will serve us
they cook the food and stuff
uhm is it are they any good though
no
typical
no
it ' s okay actually if you just go there for like on normal s
 on normal days to have dinner or or whatever breakfast
whatever
but i hardly ever go there cos if i wake up like early enough then
normally it ' s because i have lectures in the morning then i ' ll like have my
lecture a finish around uhm ten thirty then go and get my breakfast
 uhm 
 right uh huh 
 right cos you can still get breakfast before
eleven
uh uhm
then i can skip lunch
right yeah
and then so i don't have to be in the you know crowd and
stuff around like in the rush lunch hour you know
uh uhm
 sort of like a few words 
 fighting with people 
yeah
yeah and then i just have tea
uhm
so it ' s all messed up actually my cycle
it ' s really weird
yeah but then you can still cook at your hall though
it ' s not like you ' re relying on on that
yeah
uhm it ' s okay then i mean on and off you can go there for
for you know a meal or two and then when you get bored cook yourself
yeah
 yeah 
 no but like if i normally if i feel like going
out to eat then i wouldn't y you wouldn't eat there 
 a few words yeah
 exactly 
 yeah yeah 
 and if i can't be bothered then i just s
 cooked noodles and stuff you know
yeah something quick
easy and easy enough or just eat junk food
uhm uhm
which is actually really bad
i bought a new pair of trainers today
yeah
yeap
well what are 
 cost me seven hundred dollars ninety nine
dollars
oh you ' re loaded then
no i i don't why i bought them actually
far too expensive cos i set the budget
uh huh
i set
so you need a pair of trainers
well yeah m i mean my old ones are a bit
tatty-looking really
a bit embarrassing actually
it ' s got a
 two-words normal when
it ' s got a hole in it
oh oh 
 but like uh yo the water can't seep
through on it or anything but and people can't really notice
uhm uhm
but uhm i do
but it ' s time to get a new pair really 
 yeah yeah
i ' m thinking of getting some hiking boots as well
what for

 yeah yeah 
yeah i ' m sort of s picking it up to hiking s 
went last week i i told you about it
 yeah

and then we ' re going again this saturday

 where are you going 
we ' re going sai king

uh we decided the end point is going be sai kung having 
tohng seui chinese dessert 
right
yeah so i ' ve i ' ve sort of set my target where where i ' ll

so just go and work around the routes
it ' s supposed we ' re probably doing it once a month or what once
a week at these day uhm 
 were these people from your office
yeah

and then they go like uh uhm tut cycling a lot that
sort of thing so so they really so want uh so set up uhm a regular event sort
of thing
yeah
you should come play lacrosse as well since you are
getting into your sort of sportive mood yeah 
 oh 
 my sportive mood 
yeah but it ' s so far away
i don't know
 we need a goalie
we don't have a goalie and you played goalie before
 actually 
 y yeah like once or twice

yeah that ' s about it i wasn't that 
 but you trained with the squad didn't you

yeah and it ' s too regular anyway
it ' s really 
 i didn't go cos my eye swollen
it ' s still swollen it was swollen
uhm uhm
like i woke up sunday morning
uh huh
and i could feel like s kind of painful and felt
heavy
but you know how normally when you wake up sometimes may be you
had too much water to drink before
yeah
the night before and then you wake up feeling really sort of
dopey kind of whatever
uhm uhm
and i just went into toilet i looked into mirror and it was
like oh my god
it just swoll up
yeah it it uh my right eye
uhm uhm
on the eyelid on the upper
 yeah just one eye one the upper eyelid
 and just one eye 
 that ' s odd 
uhm uhm
it was swollen but like uh
you ' ve been stung by something
i don't know i don't think so
i went to see the doctor and everything
 you 
and what did he say
it ' s just stye
uh right
just like you know like uh 
 you ' ve been peeping
 tut that ' s what everyone ' s been saying
so stupid though
i haven't done anything
 it ' s i mean it ' s not scientific or anything but uh
i just don't uh well i don't normally rub my eyes i don't wear contact lenses
 okay 
yeah true
and okay my hair is kind of in a way but it ' s 
always been like that and i wash my hair everyday anyway
i don't know why actually i i caught that uhm 
well it ' s not something you catch may be i don't know but uhm i had that one
i was in guangzhou
 yeah yeah 
 one word your hair irritated the eye
probably 
uh huh
last time
and uh i thought it was just because the air in guangzhou was so
polluted
uh huh
but it came back again and it was on the same eye
i still have it
it sort of like
does it hurt though
yeah it doesn't now
so it ' s it sort of s swell up and then it ' s sore
yeah
 one word touch
yeah
and it ' s it sort of itchy as well
itchy
but not like a constant itch but i don't know how to say it
like like you ' ve been crying a lot
uh huh uh huh
just stinging itchy 
and then you keep thinking when you see thing
it actually doesn't affect my vision yeah
uhm uhm
but when you ' re looking at things i don't know whether it ' s
sort of you ' re subconsciously i don't know what it is yeah but you just keep
thinking there ' s something at the corner of your eye at or or at the
top of your 
 no but it ' s swollen you you can't sort of see
straight
it is i mean when your eye get swollen you it ' s sort of like you
know blocking your vision a little bit say so by by the time you turn to one
angle you see you know there ' s you you think that there ' s something there
but it ' s actually your eyelid
i don't know
uhm
but that was just weird
weird
but has gone down now
good
you can still see like it ' s sort of
different so people look at me like uhm you look different today 
 a few words 
 they ' ll think you didn't get enough sleep
yeah
 uh 
 that ' s that ' s one of the
uh huh yeah 
 what ' s that yeah for
it sounds like australian
shush shush shush funny sound comes out
anyway
and then i just i don't know i ' m in a bit of a foul mood today
for no reason
actually i know what ' s the what the reason is
uhm uhm
i was supposed to go see uhm uh what ' s the name of that
movie
catch me if you can
you haven't seen it yet
no
uh
it ' s quite good
cos i wanted to see it when it first came on i uhm i was
doing my project
right
and then somebody promised that he will go with me
right
or he would go with me
uh huh
uh my course-mate
uh huh
and then uh
he ' s seen it now
no he hasn't
uh he hasn't
well you can still go and see it 
 but he ' s busy with uh cos he hasn't had that
structural review i was telling you about
yeah how did it go last time
oh it was so stupid
 a few words 
yah it was really stupid cos we all got there yeah
and uhm cos normally was is uh how how how can i put this
we haven't quite developed our design to that stage that you can
really talk about like structural things
right
but uhm so basically the engineer he was just talking about
like basic things like what kind of foundation to use and if you have a
basement uh what kind of construction you need like uh what what was he
talking about
uhm diaphragm wall
diaphragm wall yeah
 and stuff like that and the other type that sort
of is like a bowl and you just 
 a few words 
 raft uh raft foundation
what is it
raft
 raft 
yeah
uh okay anyways anyways just he was just talking about these
things and and that what was that
 top 
 two-words i mean
even a few words 
 top down construction
top down or bottom up or something like that
yeah
thing like really generally stuff and then suddenly my tutor sort
of just suddenly turned up
uh huh 
 and we ' re like uh what are you doing here
 yeah we all there we were all there like we
 u just got there thinking okay that we just treat it like an
office visit you know
ove arup ' s got like a nice office so
 we were supposed to be here 
yeah they got really nice office haven't they
yeah it ' s a actually it ' s really nice
first uhm what fifth floor of festival walk
yeah they ' ve got like i i don't remember which is
 they ' ve got like one and like two levels 
 two storeys
 yeah 
and there ' s escalator going up to the second level
yeah and then like they have this triangular void in the
middle
uh huh yeah
and then like on the lower floors uh and and they ' ve got
like o uh other offices but not theirs
other companies firms whatever 
 oh they ' ve other companies office can
 you 
 you can't like that because they have a
triangular void in the middle
uh huh
and they haven't got like the design of their office they
haven't put blinds or uhm like exterior corridors so other
people can actually see their office
 uh uhm uh 
uhm uhm
they can s u see into other people ' s
office but their design uhm most what i think one level has sort of blinds so
you can't actually look into the office
uh uhm uh uhm
i mean you can't see the wall of into glass looking into
the office but they ' ve blocked up your view
and then i think another level at the bottom they ' ve
 uh huh 
is that my phone or your phone
probably yours
would you mind if i
no yeah
answer it
okay wait music
