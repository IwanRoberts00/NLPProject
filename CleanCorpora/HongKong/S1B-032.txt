good evening and welcome to newsline
""
chief executive tung chee wah delivered his fourth policy address
last week
""
some say it is his best policy address so far
""
others say it is long in style but short in substance
""
will it help to reverse mr tung  ' s plunging popularity
""
and how will it affect his chances for re- election
""
with us tonight to discuss the policy address are former
legislative councillor christine loh and professor anthony cheung head of the
department of public and social administration at the city university
""
welcome
""
christine you  ' ve said that the speech lacks vision
""
what do you think it  ' s wrong of it 
""
""
well i i i think  it if it is his best speech then he
wasn't working from a very high base
""
and i think mr tung hasn't quite decided what he wants the speech
to be
""
and uh i mean to be fair to him of course you know a string of
british governor used to give very long and turgid speeches as well
""
uh but i think today the political climate has changed and people
expect him to say more
""
now i think he he he has a hard job because many people expects
substance
""
i mean what the substance actually mean
""
now all the things that he said in his speech are many of them are
are worthy initiatives that the government should be doing
""
but to say it all in a speech just   like  reading out a
bus timetable and that  ' s not very exciting
""
so i think he  ' s got to make a choice in future
""
either he wants to have a arousing political speech
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
that points to some fundamental concern dealing with society
at that moment in time make it short make it very  impactful 
""
he needs a very good speech writer and he needs to get to the point
""
you know whether he   can  do that
""
or he  ' s going to stick to this kind of half-way style
""
he tries to be presidential packs in a number of initiatives
""
and basically still come up relatively boring
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm anthony what do you think 
""
""
well i agree that the speech uh was a bit of lacklustre
""
i think mainly because uh although mr tung did point to some
problems as he tried to uh portray himself as a chief executive who is
listening to the people
""
he did point to the fact that hong kong is now facing crisis that
our society has become less harmonious
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
but uh he failed to come out with good solutions
""
in fact uh by just listing the problems and without really
addressing them properly i don't think the the address is that inspiring
 
""
  uhm  
""
""
 i   agree with anthony
""
i mean  l  let  ' s say he  ' s picked three main subjects
education
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
uh which he can actually leave to the secretary for education
and and manpower or leave leave uh anthony leung the   executive 
councillor who  ' s been spearheading education
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
because he  ' s talked about education many times
""
so the other two new issues one is government and the other one is
poverty
""
now really he had very little to   say 
""
i mean let just take poverty
""
i mean this is a a a  a very complex issue in hong kong
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
but it  ' s obvious from what he said well he  ' s just chosen one
or two more initiatives
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
i mean they have good things to do but they won't solve the
problem
""
and he wasn't able to articulate the social concern of poverty
""
""
uhm
""
""
so i think it would be much better if he just spend an hour
and say well you know at this  po  at   at this  time i
think one of the issue that concerns the community   is  poverty
""
an here is a comprehensive   view  from the government
""
now that would have been much more  impactful 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
now you started up by saying that he wants to appear presidential
""
now you know the us president in the state of the  unio 
union address uh he does in congress but he  ' s not really talking to the
members of congress he  ' s talking to the nation 
""
""
 exact 
 
""
it  ' s done in the evening and   he  ' s  on nationwide tv
  live  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   uhm
 
""
do you think that  ' s what uh we ought to be doing in hong kong too
that is uh anthony do you think that will be better if say mr tung gave his
speech in the evening when people are home watching tv and then he can be
addressing them directly even though he is the legco chamber 
""
""
well i think uh of course uh uh uh is that i agree with you
that uh mr tung should be addressing the people rather than just the
legislative council
""
of course in terms of procedure uh this is addressed to the council
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
of course he can always uh uh deviate from the procedure 
 or  in fact   he could 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 now and he can   he can do it in the council 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
do it at   at an hour of when people are home  
""
""
 if he did it in the council at a  dif  at a
different time 
""
""
 at a time  a few words    later
yes
""
""
he he can do   it at uh 
""
""
 that that   could be done
""
""
he can do at seven   o'clock  at   night 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
 yeah   in a time   when  people are home
watching tv 
""
""
 uhm  
""
that that could be done
""
but again i think the the crust of the issue is whether uh in this
uh fourth address he was really addressing the people
""
well i like uh the way he put it in the sense that he said well he
he called the hong kong to share in some common goals
""
but i i don't know whether he do realise uh he does realise uh what
these common goals are
""
i mean it  ' s important that we must have social consensus before
the government can uh push reforms effectively
""
""
uhm if the voices still that of an older uh more paternalistic
generation
 
""
uhm   uhm  
""
""
 i   mean his voice is to say well look you know
 w  we need to be harmonious uh people need to be   rational
""
""
you need to complain less
""
and of course what he  ' s really saying is you know i have my point
of view
""
i believe in our   point  of view and i want to bring you
to my point of view rather than to really say well look you know uhm your
views are valid and  i  you know i  ' ve got to deal with them
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
but i thought there was a curious point
""
it was towards the end of his speech when he said that uh  s
 you know some people are belittling our own people 
""
""
uhm
 
""
i mean who else should we be criticising if not our leaders will
be will be criticising other countries  '  leaders 
""
""
 w  well i i think the problem was you know that was i
i  ' m sure that was his paragraph
""
i  ' m sure that the speech writer got it in because he really 
 wanted    to  say something like that
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
""
""
it it shows his personality it shows his frustration as well
 
""
uhm 
""
""
you know i think uhm mr tung has tried to serve hong kong and
i believe   his  dedication completely and his commitment
""
the the problem is i think he doesn't see other perspectives 
  from  other people in society
""
  and  and then he says to these people well you know
you you haven't been very harmonious and uh why don't know put hong kong  ' s
  interest  first   and  be more harmonious
""
  and  then he says well you know we  ' ve fed up with
uh  i  irrational arguments
""
you know you should be more rational
""
now just imagine all those people who  ' ve been complaining 
 all  this   time 
""
how they feel
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
yes   because  it suggest that uh people will complain
who criticises are not rational 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
well uh well that is precisely my point
 
""
uhm 
""
""
he he certainly feels very bitter   about   
the  sort of opposition
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
""
yes
""
""
or criticism uh uh voiced against him
 
""
uhm   uhm  
<$b
""
 but[>  of course as christine pointed out i mean
that they they he has to find out why people
 
""
uhm  
""
are so frustrated
""
i think it  ' s good for him to list governance as one of the three
major areas   to be addressed 
""
but then uh what has he said about governance he didn't give
people any  pr  prospect for review of our constitutional arrangements
""
he didn't give people any prospect of further uh development of
 ou  our democratic system
""
he did not really address effectively the problems that exist
between the executive and the legislative council
""
  what he has done seem to to strengthen the executive
authorities 
 
""
 yes yes  
""
 well he he did say that he did say that he   want to
the system of accountability    uh  better
""
uh but uh he didn't outline any concrete measures
""
  he  just said that they  ' re going to a review 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 well  
""
but that that  ' s right
""
now actually if he doesn't have a fundamental review he  ' s not
prepared   to enter  into looking at how hong kong should redesign
the political system
""
he will remain frustrated
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
uhm 
""
""
because i mean he he also talked about the executive council
and that there might be a might a time in future     to review
it
""
i mean first of all we must remember the membership of the
executive council well first of all not all of his choosing
""
secondly is the executive council is non-professional
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm 
""
""
they hadn't always been able to give him good political
advice
""
""
uhm
""
""
because it  ' s a part-time and not a very serious body 
 in  terms of day-to-day working
""
they  ' re also not charting the political direction
""
now   of  course most of them are un-elected as 
 well 
""
so he  ' s not getting that kind of support
""
then you have the civil service
""
the civil service wants to have the cake and eat it
""
  like they want to be  they want to continue to have
the power to set policies and yet they want to be politically neutral
""
and as far as mr tung is concerned if certain policies happened to
developed by the civil service he doesn't want to as we say in cantonese eat
the dead cat   right 
""
he doesn't want to be blamed for   policies  that
have not been successful
""
  so  okay why not give it to the civil servants 
 or to  other the political appointees to take that
""
now as far as the legislature is concerned the legislative 
 council  feels that they have the people  ' s mandate and yet nobody
wants to share any power with them
""
so in way everybody is unhappy but everybody would essentially
remain unhappy if we don't redesign the system
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm
 
""
yeah anthony in terms of uh making the government law accountable
""
""
""
uhm
 
""
are you optimistic uh about the outcome of this review 
""
""
you mean the uh   the proposal  to make the senior
officials the principle officials   accountable 
 
""
 the review that  
""
 well   to make the   government  self uh
  more  accountable
""
he said uh he want to make the system of accountability  
better  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
""
well but what he has said so far about accountability is simply to
say okay next time uh those uh bureau chiefs uh those uh principle  offici
 official level uh will be uh given a different uh uh sort of employment
terms
""
so that could mean that could refer to some kind of 
one-word  system so that those appointed as uh policy officials
will be working more closely with him as chief executive
 
""
uhm 
""
""
but that is only as far as uh sort of uh the uh relationship
between him and the other senior officials
 
""
uhm uhm   uhm uhm  
""
""
 it was still   it was still be a very imperfect
  political  system whether lines of   accountability 
are not clear
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uhm i mean if all he is saying is will make sure that the
people who are willing to take up the policy portfolio will be politically
accountable that there are some kind of a political appointee that they sit
on the executive council
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
uhm that still doesn't answer the question of how they relate
to to uh   negligence  to   what  happens to  
irresponsibility 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
uhm 
""
""
but the issue of accountability has more to do with how his
government can be more accountable to the people
""
   now  let say that mr tung in future has uh free
hand in appointing all the top officials
""
i mean they have different employment terms
""
they are different from uh other uh senior civil servants
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
right 
""
""
now if the public is not happy with the performance of any of
these top officials is he willing to fire them
""
  so  how how will his uh judgement be
""
whether his assessment criteria will be the same as those  
adopted by the community 
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 right  and then   immediately we think of
robert chung and   and  andrew lo
""
  you  know how mr lo is still there despite i think uh
he he might be a very loyal and close   uh  a long serving uhm
supporter of mr tung but but the problem really is he  ' s a huge political
liability now
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
and you uh anthony you mentioned in uh there there was nothing on
constitutional development 
""
""
uhm
 
""
and mr tung said that uh there need to be a gestation period 
""
""
uhm
 
""
uh and that we have plenty of time    uh  do you
agree with that 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
well i think uh of course the basic law uh does not provide any
opportunity for us to change the basic arrangements before two o seven unless
we change the basic law
""
but even if we take two o seven as the target date
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i don't think we have a lot of time because uh like what mr
tung said in his uh speech uh constitutional issues are always controversial
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
so we need a a a full period for uh uh debate within society
""
and i think it  ' s already time now
""
it  ' s time now
""
""
right
""
""
to start the process
""
""
 i mean    the question  really is that mr
tung will have just under two years   to serve 
""
uh his next policy address will be his last before the next
selection process
""
does he see himself     as starting a process to 
 talk  about   the  process already designed   or not
""
 
""
 okay   
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yes  
""
 okay  
""
we  ' ll continue of this after the break
""
don't go away we  ' ll be right back   a break 
 
""
welcome back
""
we  ' re discussing the chief executive  ' s policy address
""
now christine in in his policy address he also said that he was
going to look at the conversation of the executive council
""
uh do you think that something ought to be done about the
conversation 
""
""
oh i i do think so
""
uhm because in the basic law it doesn't actually prevent him to
bring more people onto the executive council right now
""
and i think uhm the  current legislative  council probably
not working as well as it could
""
he should be already making uh political appointments from civil
servants who are willing to take on a more political role to sit on the civil
 ser  uh to on the executive council
""
he should be looking at appointing legislative councillors and
more people from the outside because frankly he  ' s not getting the kind of
policy support that he really needs
 
""
uhm
""
 an  anthony do you think the executive council  f 
is functioning well or or not 
""
""
well it depends on what we expect the executive council to be
""
if we just expect the exco to be a body of advisers behind the
scene then of course uh uh this is what we can   get  but if we
expect a more pro-active exco in other words  ex  exco members have to
come out and defend policies articulate     uh government
policies   then  of course i i don't think the existing batch of
exco members are doing that well
""
  uhm  
""
""
 yes  
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm actually i  ' m surprise that he  ' s uh delayed for so long 
""
""
uhm
 
""
because it uh already past the halfway point in in his term 
""
""
yeah
 
""
and  n    normally there  ' s  a reshuffle he do
it   in in midterm  
""
""
 well he had the  
""
  w  well i think one   of the problems with mr
tung is he he doesn't appear to be too decisive
""
he doesn't also appear to have the quality of advice that he he
knows how to act on the political issue
 
""
well now that uh you mentioned this if uh you were approached
would you serve on the executive council 
""
""
well depends on what kind of terms it is
 
""
yes 
""
""
yes
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
collective responsibility
""
""
well it it depends on how it all is right
""
i mean   if  if you are saying okay come and sit on
the executive council in   the  present format   
 well     i don't see that we can serve very well
""
now if actually what he said was let  ' s what he  ' s trying to do is
a two-step approach     you know there  ' s got to be a longer
and more complex approach on redesigning   the  whole of the
political system
""
but in the mean time what we want to explore is the front end
""
everything that you do that will   point  towards
greater transparency better accountability and training   political
 leaders
""
now then that might be different
""
you know it was just ad hoc appointment one or two   but
 in the end what happen is     you have to shut up
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
yeah
""
i i think with the exco at the moment is partly because a a lot of
these people right now on exco they are not necessarily handpicked by mr tung
himself
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and secondly of curse uh uh mr tung doesn't really know too
well what he wants the exco to be
""
maybe by now   after  three years    he knows
better 
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 yes yes  
""
all right
""
uh now of course anthony you are not eligible not serve in exco
because of your activity within the democratic party 
""
""
uhm
 
""
is that right 
""
""
well we don't know
""
i mean of course mr tung has never extended any invitation  
to dp members 
 
""
 but i i thought   the democratic party made it very
clear 
""
""
uhm
 
""
that it would not observe these rules of uh 
""
""
uhm
 
""
confidentiality
