please refer to exhibits p thirty and thirty one the two credit card slips cantonese translation  and you can see on p thirty the amount therefore is five hundred cantonese translation and answer    yes  and on p thirty one the amount therefore is three thousand  cantonese translation    yes  and then you have been invited in chief to crosscheck with exhibit p twenty six the manual record cantonese translation  now i believe on page one you can see transaction one is for five hundred   uh sorry he he doesn't have the   one page one of p  uh i ' m sorry     page seventy six    he he hasn't got    oh sorry uh i a few words is p twenty six please ms kang p thirty thirty one and p twenty six cantonese translation    page one yes  page one of p twenty six   that ' s p that ' s thirteen twe no no page one o seven one   one three two your honour   in one one three two zero    two words    yeah that ' s that ' s number page is one o seven one  yes  yes and the first transaction is for five hundred cantonese translation and answer    yes  in fact the sixteenth also for five hundred cantonese translation and answer    yes  so is transaction number twenty four cantonese translation and answer    yes  and the last one transaction number twenty nine for three thousand cantonese translation and answer    yes  and i think you can confirm that uh on the manual record there ' s no time reference cantonese translation and answer    correct  now take a look of the computer print out produced by the head office that is to say p twenty eight for the corresponding transactions  cantonese translation and answer    sorry p  p twenty eight ' p twenty eight ' overlap ' dihn nouh ' - ' computer'  cantonese translation and answer  now uh i would refer to the time reference on the left hand side column and the net amount in the middle ' and the net ' overlap ' nah gam ' - ' and so ' cantonese translation  now for the time reference nine thirty one you have five hundred cantonese translation    nine  nine thirty one for five hundred    thirty one  uh are net five hundred yes   yes  yes and then for time reference eleven nineteen also for five hundred  cantonese translation and answer    yes  the next items is some time fourteen something which i cannot read from my copy but you can see again the amount is five hundred ' but you ' overlap ' gam jauh ' - ' and so ' cantonese translation    right and cantonese translation  below the entry for fourteen o four ' entry for fourteen o four ' overlap ' haih meih hou ching cho - ' it is clear that '    the ninth thirty one and the next was ten nineteen  oh that ' s right that ' s two words     no no fourteen something    five outings  and then the next one was fourteen     one word   s can you read out the time that you have witnessed     sixteen something yes cantonese translation and answer    uh i cannot see the time because uh the it is a punch hole  covering the time     uh uh  must be fourteen zero something would you agree     one-word you know  cantonese translation  because you can see part of the zero fourteen  zero something    yah i cantonese translation and answer    yes  and then uh the time reference for fifteen twenty nine  cantonese translation and answer    yes  for three thousand cantonese translation and answer    yes  and these four entries seems to correspond to the four entries you had showed the court on p twenty six cantonese translation    correspond to what  with the corresponding entries reported on p twenty six the manual record he just one word     a few words  thank you cantonese translation and answer    yes  and can you please turn to page two of p twenty eight  cantonese translation and answer  for time entry eighteen fifty nine cantonese translation and answer  uh something unusual seems to happen because the entries at the gross amount the net amount and the profit amount they were all negative  cantonese translation and answer    yes    yes  but uh on the same report as contained in p twenty eight i don't think you can find any similar entry for six eighty five being the gross and the net in four twenty five     could you could you also looked at page eight uhm eighteen forty eight  forty   eighteen forty eight  oh i see yes   and then you have that i don't know the the the number of the invoice number is fifty eight and then sixty one yeah and oh uh what ' s this man stand for  salesman i think    salesman   yes    o six o three two six is the same salesman it it it looks like someone ' s changed their mind about purchasing but you can see the identical figures as they are right across same sales and the only difference is the time and invoice number  yes   the same  yes and and the time gap according to the record is uhm about eleven   yeah  oh no no no eleven seconds no eleven minutes     minutes minutes  do you agree cantonese translation  but you cannot i i ' you cannot i i ' overlap ' le gouh' -'this ' believe you are not be sure the two transactions as recorded in eighteen forty eight and eighteen fifty nine uhm reflect o or they cancelled each other you can't be sure of that cantonese translation and answer    uh if uh that is a record in in manual record then certainly these two entries uh can be uh reconciled against each other   all right     re records in manuals and the records   yes  but i don't think there ' s any such record or entries in page uh in p twenty six cantonese translation and answer    uh because p twenty six uh is for day shift cantonese answer    however if you check the time here eighteen fifty nine then it ' s must be uh night shift time a long pause  yes but uh i think in comparison if you look at uh p four for the transaction of   p four  p four cantonese translation    okay  uh or the transaction on the ninth cantonese translation and uh for time entries seventeen seventeen and seventeen twenty cantonese translation and answer a long pause   they are exactly reversal of numbers do you agree    yeah they cantonese translation     ye ye yes cantonese translation and answer    yes correct    oh oh oh yes no no no that ' s salesman something that the invoice are two different invoices and that was again there was  so it seems that by looking just on page four you can be pretty certain that there are mistakes about that    yes cantonese translation and answer    yes  but you can't be so certain when you just look at uhm p twenty eight cantonese translation    can you so certain p twenty eight yeah cantonese translation and answer    uh cannot be certain of what  that there are cancellations for the same transaction  cantonese translation and answer    uh there are only two reasons for negative figures  no i ' m not now asking you to comment for the reason but uh for the certainty you are not so certain in comparison cantonese translation and answer    i believe uh it ' s very probable that uh the two entries cancel each other because they were handled by the same salesman  cantonese answer    and the time lapse is a very short period of time   cantonese answer    and same amount  what i was suggesting perhaps you missed the point is that the degree of certainty is not that as you can see on uh page on p four  cantonese translation and answer  because they had no intervening transactions ' because they had no intervening transactions ' overlap ' gouh dou yat ding haih deui siu ' -'they must off set one another ' cantonese translation  and the time gap is much shorter ' and ' overlaps ' nah ' - ' and'  cantonese translation and answer    however the intervening transaction in the sum of three thousand four hundred dollars the salesman certainly    three thousand four hundred    three thousand four hundred    this is an exhibit p uhm  eight eight p twenty eight    oh yeah    p twenty eight     twenty eight  that ' s  the second page    uhm  yes fine second page time  time therefore is uh eighteen fifty four   yes that ' s intervening one and that ' s four five five it ' s not three thousand three hundred four hundred and fifty five or three four of the same   yes     it ' s the net amount  the net amount     yeah i i was looking at the gross   so i i i i ' m sorry uh my mistake totally three thousand four hundred     the gross     that ' s right  uhm    net    yes    the salesman certainly need time to handle it    yes yes the salesman is certainly needs time to thank you  now am i correct to understand that at the end of the day when the amount of money in the till is to be checked against the details as shown in the machine at     when amount money in the till is being checked against  against the details as print out by the computer at the shop   yes now just let me get this right  yes   there are the details printed out by the computer at the shop  now that ' s are individual invoices and this this p twenty eight is the computer head office not   or perhaps manual  head office one   yes this is the head office computer p twenty eight  yes many taking in in in in     and the computer at the shop prints out the uhm thirty and thirty one is that it  thirty and thirty one is the manual generate     ah that is the manual that ' s manual but it prints out the uhm    the two-words    back here is     three words  the other one is such as saying    two words   p twenty p twenty five    page twenty twenty five right uhm but there is no there is no computer uhm where reconciliation at the shop is uh  i ' m taking him to this point   uh you ' re taking him to that point yes because but anyway p twenty eight is definitely the head office   yes  head office one   computer print out  yes now uh can you confirm p twenty eight or reports like p twenty eight is only available at the head office cantonese translation and answer    yes  and the information were gathered by either the supervisor or the manager returning the magnetic tapes to the head office cantonese translation    by supervisor or manager yes cantonese translation and answer    yes  but at the shop itself the computer also prints out a sheet with the details of the transaction uh down   computer itself  uh print details of the transactions     the computers  the computer     at the shop    that ' s the different computer at the shop   a different computer    yeah   the shop computer yeah   the shop computer yeah   did generate a a a print out for the transactions of the day do you agree cantonese translation and answer   uh when there is such a need the computer in the shop will generate a detail    transaction    transaction sheet otherwise it will only generate a sheet showing the  cantonese answer    total amount only  now in fact     uh i i mean the basic information on the head  off sorry basic information printed out by the head office computer is derived in a shop computer cantonese translation and answer    yes correct    okay and can the shop computer give you the same sort of information as the head office computer prints out cantonese translation and answer    yeah out but uh it will only be done when there is such a need   uhm and the uh yes but i mean a few words  yes  and the usual factors is that     mr fung please uhm  and and the head office computer is relying on the magnetic tapes i think you call them  yes   the magnetic tapes uhm be used by the shop computer  cantonese translation and answer    correct a long pause    correct thank you  and normally the computer at the shop as she told us will only generate the grand total of the day cantonese translation and answer   correct a long pause  and the duty of the manager will be to check the receipts  including cash foreign currency and credit card slips against the grand total   receipts foreign currency and what was the other thing   and  credit card slips against the grand total generated by the shop computer cantonese translation and answer    correct  and normally when the till money and the foreign currency and the credit cards slips were checked three persons would be present  cantonese translation and answer    check by what check  uh in the presence of three persons three staff cantonese translation and answer    correct  now say for example for the first transaction on the ninth  cantonese translation    first transaction on what  on the ninth it here it is ' it here it is ' overlap unclear cantonese word  cantonese translation and answer    yes    what p number  uh p five my learned friend called it the cash breakdown re  re overlaps ' daih ' - ' number ' cantonese translation and answer record and the left the top left portion i ' m sorry   p five  yes p five cantonese translation and answer  uhm the left the top left portion shows the cash taking  cantonese translation and answer    yes  and then   sorry top left shows what  the cash taking that is the cash receipts of the day   top left  top left uh left top left portion the f the top left quadrant of the page   quadrant     uh one nine five six   yes    yes yes yes and here now top left i was looking at the notes you know which was part of the printed four thousand and five hundred et cetera yeah top left quadrant yes yes cash has taken for the day yes  and al   and in fact it ' it ' overlaps ' le ' -'this'  cantonese translation and answer    correct  and i believe the formation shows for example there are five pieces of one thousand banknotes amounting to five thousand cantonese translation and answer    yes  and there is no banknotes for fifty dollars or twenty dollars  cantonese translation and answer    correct  and then the grand the total for the cash is f five thousand nine hundred fifty six cantonese translation and answer    yes  and on the column for counted and signed first you saw the signature of the cashier janette   sorry sorry the quadrant what  uh for th the for the signatures downs there you first saw that of janet cantonese answer    quadrant for signatures    we know the total is uh   we we know the total   near the top were two signatures here     oh here in foreign currency is it  no no no no     two words count and  sign   again your honour the first of the top left quadrant   oh count and sign yes  count and signed cantonese translation and answer    yes correct  and then the right most signature of josie the second defendant cantonese translation and answer    yes  now normally am i correct to say it will be the cashier who count the money in the presence of the supervisor cantonese translation and answer    that i ' m not sure  but was that the instruction you give to to the staff  cantonese translation and answer    uh three persons had to be present to settle the account   cantonese answer    uhm cantonese answer    uh sorry carry on okay    and who should be responsible for counting the money is a thing for them to decide among themselves    sorry three persons have to be present uhm is this are based on rank for example at one stage is the two i think it was two salespersons one cashier one supervisor or so many permutations or combination    two or two more one of from each crew     yes  and uh the the three persons are they also signed and that the process of their of jobs and for example does the manager always have to be one of the three cantonese translation and answer    the cashier must be present    cashier must be yes cantonese answer    if the duty manager was present then the manager would be responsible    duty manager if present cantonese answer    however in case the manager had already come off duty or was leave cantonese answer    then it would be the duty supervisor cantonese answer   and another staff member would be present  have you been present during such occasions when the till money the foreign currency and the credit cards were checked against the grand total generated by the shop computer cantonese translation and answer    yes cantonese answer    when the company first started to use computerised system   a long pause  and would you accept the suggestion that normally the one who count either the money or the the credit card slips would be the one junior in ranking cantonese translation  of course the the one senior would be present cantonese translation and answer    uh that i ' m not sure because it ' s a thing to be decided among themselves a long pause  by looking at the numeral entries on the left top    looking at what  the numbers at the top left quadrant of p five can you conform they are the handwritings of gary cantonese translation  <$a the first clip cantonese translation    the handwriting of gary  yes you are     uh ca cary that ' s right  cantonese translation    does it mix up with the time when cantonese translation and answer    uh i don't know that anything about that    do do you know cary ' s uh handwriting cantonese translation and answer    no i don't cannot recognise his handwriting     don't know  cannot recognise his handwriting  or but you     actually one-word just a minute his handwriting uhm that actually uhm does read well as my note cannot recognise his handwriting so we can't recognise their and does this mean you can't recognise his handwriting in in general not the specific of the document in front of you   yes cantonese translation and answer    correct    i e in general terms he ' s no no no you you ' re telling a an ambiguous meaning and so that uhm  but would you accept that the handwritings   now which we are looking at the   a again p five   p five  the handwritings on the top right     top qua quadrant is it  top top right and top left quadrants     top right and top left quadrants  are quite different   the four is very very different but two let ' s see if we can find the two across are like that  yes i i ask him to compare the handwritings on the top left quadrant and the top right quadrant and locates they they are quite different  cantonese translation and answer    correct  it suggests that for the compilation of p five   there are     the the of the com   of the compilation    compilation   of  yes   yup  of p five gary d one wrote the entries on the taft le  top left quadrant   p five cary wrote figures on top left quadrant yes  cantonese translation and answer    i cannot be sure    and from your questions that there ' s been nothing to show in this that the person accounts for the the writing and or the different system operates are the most senior person who do the writing  no i ' m suggesting that the junior one would count   yeah you ' re   and the senior one will write   ah so that ' s what you are coming to the junior one counts the senior writes  yes he relies on the information supplied for this     right we ' ll just get that down and do you agree that the junior person would count two words p three before then instead of it ' s up to them to    yes yes and i     i wonder if this is no point to uhm if i asking again uh but that ' s what your  yes my case     that ' s what your proposition has been and he says that it ' s up to the people concerned  yes   yeah right   and at east on p five we can see different handwritings   yes uh there are also different signatures the bottom and the  yes   they are all right down at the bottom the bottom the right bottom the bottom right corner the bottom it left looks like josie perhaps and the bottom right   it ' s cary    it ' s what    it ' s cary    cary is it well may be i think uhm i cannot regulate and up at up at the top left quadrant there is a signature and then there is another one josie yeah and well some forty percent josie and then the one i don't know which shown your friend said it ' s may be cary  yes   but the witness said he doesn't recognise cary ' s    yes  no   but he does recognise josie he has given evidence on that   yes  now in chief at the end of the day when asked if anybody can withdraw any cash at the shop by producing credit cards you answered that in accordance with the company ' s policy that would not be allowed recall that   yeah and and and is your question goes too far you have said that in chief he is asked if anyone withdraw but the question as i recalled was does anyone has authorised or uhm to withdraw yes   there ' s a difference between being allowed to do something and and be actually going ahead and and and and doing it uh uh   yes yes   so so would you then correct the question please  uh perhaps if i may have the benefit of having the costs   oh i see but     but in chief you are    depending one have authority to withdraw money cantonese translation  and the answer is that in accordance with company policy that will not be allowed cantonese translation    other than josie  am i right     that ' s correct cantonese translation and answer    uh money cannot be withdrawn uh means that one cannot withdrawn money by producing a credit card    oh a few words cantonese translation and answer    yup cantonese question and answer    change of goods    uh if a customer comes to change goods then uh staff can take money out from the till to give money to the customer cantonese answer    and make a record uh in the computer  now   now could i have that again please could could you repeat that please mr interpreter    uh if a costumer comes to change the goods    uh    the staff member can take money out from the till and give the money to the customer and then make a record in the computer  cantonese answer    and also have to make a record in the manual record  unidentified speech    record in computer and must make record in manual    record    records in cantonese answer    and to be signed by the duty supervisor    to be signed by duty supervisor cantonese answer    or duty manager  now when you answered you seemed to emphasize the word policy may i ask you to comment as a matter of fact did that happen before  cantonese translation and answer    withdraw money    pardon   but i ' m just cla clarify we are talking about withdrawing money not not changing goods to cash cantonese translation and answer    uh may the question be put in a more direct way uh i i don't quite understand the question    yes uh could you uhm explain the   had there been     yes one word the policy you comparing with well than you just like in a little while ago you talked about an authorised or or someone withdrawing and if someone can withdraw money from here undoubtedly it will turning up with the with a shop one-word and and uh taking it   that  uhm   and this is not company policy and anyway you are trying to draw the distinction between po policy and what might have been going on yes exactly     all right if you would explain that to   yes  now had there been occasions in the past when although f  the policy is as stated by you in the witness box but what happened in fact was that giver d s take money or withdraw money from the shop  cantonese translation and answer    i don't think this is possible cantonese answer    cos cantonese answer    the duty supervisor cantonese answer    had say responsibility to protect the shop ' s uh company ' s  money and property    duty supervisor manager duty supervisor has responsibility to protect    the shop uh company ' s money and property    the shop    money    money and pro    property    and property yes  or put it in other words had there been occasions before when some staff member    mem  some staff member   uh staff you mean  deposit an iou slip with the shop and then take away an equivalent amount of cash cantonese translation    deposit what   an iou slip    iou    uh cantonese translation and answer    uh i don't think this is possible cantonese answer    because if cash is taken away then at the end of the day when the account that has to be settled then the amount of money will not tie with the amount generated with by the computer  well and what if   uh does yes but uhm what about iou being put in in the morning by a member of the staff who wants the money for uhm something urgent required quickly and then it ' s replaced with cash later in the day cantonese translation    can that occur or cantonese translation and answer    uh i don't think it ' s possible cantonese answer    because when the accounts uh are settled at night  cantonese answer    the money will then be kept inside a safe cantonese answer    and on the following morning cantonese answer    it will be taken direct to a bank cantonese answer   by me or by a more senior staff member a long pause  what if the redemption of the iou slip occurs before the end of day accounts checking cantonese translation  that certainly would not be noticed by the head office people would you accept cantonese translation and answer    unless the cashier allows such thing to happen otherwise  cantonese answer    because the cashier is responsible for the money he or she handles    so a cashier could allow this uh but take responsibility for it  cantonese translation and answer    he cantonese answer    he or she is not allowed to usual but just now it was mentioned that the it would not be noticed    uhm uhm    by the head office    yeah two words     this uh staff member then this is the only way the cashier can do    thank you several sentences  now in fact when you gave your statement to the icac on the twenty fifth of april nineteen ninety one you had been asked if the company allows the staff to take money from the company by using their own credit cards or that of their friends cantonese translation and answer    uh it ' s is impossible  yes i ' m i have just asked you had did you remember recalled being asked this question cantonese translation and answer    uh may the question be repeated     yes   yes  you were then asked if the company allows the staff to take money from the company by using their own credit cards or that of their friends  cantonese translation and answer    uh that i cannot be sure   or perhaps i     sorry are you cannot be sure or you cannot recall  cantonese translation    no i cannot recall    i i cannot recall because uh it ' s long time since    yes uh yes well     one yea plus    you want to withdraw the statement do you  yes   yes  or perhaps well b before i show you the statement     but the thing does the original in english or in the chinese  i think in chinese   it ' s in chinese     chinese yes so please go ahead in english okay a long pause     two-words uh  do you recall having   uh here is mr tong although this might be simple matters    yes certainly   yes actually and i think will probably be ten minutes before we carry on all right tape restarts   were you aware     uh sorry cantonese translation    remind her of his oath  were you aware of the fact that your wife mrs choi had on a number of occasions taken some pack cash some money from the shop either by depositing or not depositing iou slips a long pause cantonese translation and answer    i cannot recall i don't know  but will you exclude this possibility cantonese translation and answer    it ' s possible however it would create trouble uh for our settling of the accounts by the office  by the way is sh she a shareholder and director of the company cantonese translation and answer    yes  now may i refer you to the statement you had supplied to icac on the twenty fifth of april ninety one cantonese translation and answer    yes  now take a look of the statement 'the statement ' overlap ' ching neih tai yat tai ' - ' please take a look at ' cantonese translation <$a you recognise that being yours   yes  had your signatures cantonese translation and answer    yes  and look at paragraph three cantonese translation and answer  you read it first cantonese translation a long pause  ask if the company allows the staff to take away money from the company by producing their own credit cards or that of their friends  cantonese translation and answer    yes  and then your reply is that it is not allowed by the company ' s policy cantonese translation and answer    correct  and yet in the same paragraph you also stated that you expect something of that sort would happen and they have to get your permission first cantonese translation and answer    yes cantonese answer    but i meant to say  yes cantonese answer    uh i have to be informed and i would then decide whether i would allow such thing to happen cantonese answer    the decision is by me cantonese answer    uh it did not means that    pardon    when it did not means that when i had been informed it it could then be done    yeah  the question then is am i correct to say you were aware of some practices whereby money were taken from some shoppers by production of credit cards cantonese translation    sorry you aware  were you aware of such practice cantonese translation and answer    no  if that is the case why did you use the word in fact you your you yourself use the english word expect in your own statement why did you expect this may happen cantonese translation and answer    because if anything cantonese answer    happens in a shop i should be informed because i    but sorry if if anything     if anything happened in the shop i should be informed because i was the proprietor of the shop cantonese answer   and then i would decide what actions to be taken  cantonese answer    or i personally lend money to that person cantonese answer    or i would deduct the person ' s wages    and found some ways just a few words  which you would to deduct from wages or to give in advance on wages  cantonese translation and answer    an ad an advance and then    yeah   the advance would be deduct from the wages    yeah cantonese answer    because if a person with shows us money with a credit card i would then suffer a loss cantonese answer    and uh no one would compensate me this loss cantonese answer    why should i do such a thing a long pause  and that is why i say a little bit strange when i read your your statement as contained in paragraph three of the statement i just produced to you cantonese translation  because you said you expect something of this to happen  cantonese translation and answer    uh perhaps uh there were an omission if preceding it    uh sorry    if uh the word if there was an omission if  uh concerning all these credit transactions was that the case you had in discussion with cary d one soon after the twenty third of april nineteen ninety one cantonese translation    soon after the  twenty third of april nineteen ninety one cantonese translation and answer    yes    yes uh twenty third of april  after that was the last transaction   yes that ' s after the last transaction and if if if may you can clear me that uhm he wouldn't be alerted to what would what might not have been going on until the end of the month when they statement goes out to the uhm sort of credit card uhm the genuine credit card holders   no that is not my point what i ' m trying to invite him to confirm is that can you can confirm this    right     there was    there was a discussion which you two words  has got nothing to do with uhm what or might not have been going on   there was  no in fact you you invite cary to the office to have a discussion between ' between ' overlaps unclear cantonese word cantonese translation and answer    yes cantonese answer    because uh icac had informed me that uh such thing happened    is it so in in april cantonese answer     how however after the twenty and odd that could be any time of course    yes soon after it  soon after   so it was as soon after     yes soon after  yes   apparently soon after yah but soon after yes because icac what   had informed me    had   that such thing happened    me that such things happened yes go on  and had a discussion cary had told you that he was never present during any of such credit transactions cantonese translation answer    correct    sorry what was the date of this statement that you put to on  uhm yes and that is     i think i have got it down   twenty fifth   twenty fifth    twenty  fifth of april    of  of april yes chapter twenty seven everything    that is yes that ' s is yes uh if you hear from the other witness  one word twenty seven that is yeah    i though there had been a month before the transactions go through the system    now i think the evidence will show are such that a few words the evidence was showing that that uh it was that it included they were the the icac a few words    yes  and did he also tell you that he was only present at the end of the day when he was responsible to check the daily checkings that is to say the cash the foreign currency and the credit card slips cantonese translation and answer    yes  and i suppose he also told you that he was not present o  uh on such tape stops and restarts  you were informed by your wife about what she had promised  cantonese translation and answer    yes  and when you go home did you check with her about that  cantonese translation and answer    no  and did you aware your wife did give a statement to the icac  cantonese translation and answer    yes  have you ever read her statement cantonese translation and answer    no a long pause  and were you aware that sometimes although cary d one was off the duty he might go back to the shop just to see if everything was okay  cantonese translation and answer    yes a long pause  in fact you helped him to
