good evening and welcome to newsline
in the last few days the government has been unveiling details of
its proposed old age pension scheme 
under the plan employers and employees will pay one and a half
percent each of the employee ' s income and everyone over the age of
sixty-five would get a pension of two thousand three hundred dollars a month
the government would make an initial contribution of ten billion
dollars 
mr patten has called the package a generous and prudent one but
the main political parties have reservations and the expatriate community is
uneasy about paying into something from which it might not benefit 
one chinese language newspaper in addition has claimed that it will
mean a huge financial burden for the post nineteen ninety-seven sar
government 
my co-host is frank ching and we ' re joined in the studio by the
acting secretary for education and manpower lam woon kwong 
hello mr lam
uhm a huge financial burden for the sar government 
not at all
we are proposing a very prudent scheme at a very modest cost to the
community 
at one point five contribution one point five percent contribution
rate the uh cost is considered by many to be very modest 
at a benefit level of two thousand three hundred hong kong dollars
i think uh the public al also ought to agree that is a very basic
level of pension benefits 
uh we are not suggesting uh any uh huge uh burden to be borne
by the future sar one-word government
we are suggesting a one-off capital injection of ten billion to
cover any unforeseen circumstances in the first few years of operation but
over time the scheme itself should generate some surplus and that surplus
will provide a safety cushion and run the scheme itself so it it ' s not a
scheme which will uh which should cause anybody any particular worries in the
future
 
but the number of old age pensioners in hong kong is expected to
rise dramatically over the next few decades isn't it 
the number of aged people will increase obviously but uh we
are we have a growth population
our working population is also projected to grow as well so that
will uh take off part of the impact and also part of the uh proposals in the
scheme is that we are indexing benefits to prices whereas contributions
we are charging at uh one point five percent of the wage increase so the
differential uh between wage and price movement will also absorb part of the
impact and that is why overall taking these factors toget together
we are uh having a uh more prudent scheme than than many others elsewhere
mr lam this is basically a welfare program
why are you disguising it and calling it a pension plan
well if you take the uh international labour organization ' s
definition they would never admit that this is welfare
i mean they would call it social security or social insurance and
this is probably the best description of the nature of the scheme
it is a self-help scheme whereby the active members of the
economy contribute to provide a degree of insurance for their future uh
when they get old when they lose their earning power and that is what the
scheme is all about
well in a pension plan usually there is some correlation
between what you put in and what you take out eventually
in in your uh plan a person who makes four thousand dollars a month
will put in a hundred dollars 
uh a person who makes uh forty thousand will put in a thousand
dollars a month and when those two people get to be sixty-five years old they ' ll
both get the same amount 
is that fair
well this scheme aims to provide a floor of income security
for our elderly people 
uh it is very common elsewhere for uh nations to have two tiers of
uh retirement protection
the first is the basic universal pension protection
the second layer is much more earnings related i e uh you save uh
and and if you earn more obviously you can save more and that is in
addition
but we are suggesting that since hong kong hasn't had this very
basic income protection we are suggesting that at a very modest cost 
should we also note at this stage of our affluence provide that basic floor
of income protection and that ' s what the scheme is all about
but at the same time we are promoting voluntary retirement schemes
we are encouraging companies to set up schemes for their own
employees so that they will have lump sum protection when they retire
take the lump sum retirement protection together with our basic
regular pension payments then we will have uh very comprehensive hensive
 coverage for our elderly people
seems to me that what you are doing is really shifting the
responsibility of taking care of uh old age uh maybe indigent old age people
onto the uh shoulders of uh other people uh the working uh people of hong
kong including uh foreign domestic helpers uh who will not possibly
ever enjoy the benefit of uh retiring in hong kong
this is a a a major misperception 
if you look at the figures uh and look at them seriously 
government will on average over the next thirty years be contributing at
least one third to the cost of the old age pension scheme 
we are going to play an active part in funding the scheme
but we are asking the employers and employees because they will
eventually benefit themselves to share the costs uh
 yeah you are talking 
uh t tell me how how will that benefit eventually
uh i let i have a a foreign domestic uh helper at home uh
and i uh put in one and a half percent of her salary into this fund
how would i benefit eventually
well when you reach sixty-five you will benefit when your
spouse reach sixty-five she will benefit and if you have parents
now who are over sixty-five they will benefit
 one word not 
but but not the person who is supposed to benefit the foreign
domestic helper 
she would never benefit
 the nature the nature of social insurance is
that it is a collective contribution and collective help self-help scheme 
so anyone who has played a part in it would have the opportunity to benefit
i mean if your uh maid stay long enough uh when she reaches that
age she will also benefit
but that is of course uh you may argue that it ' s
academic because you may not employ her when she is sixty-five
 but let ' s look at the other side 
okay 
 but 
 no no no it ' s not it ' s not that argument at all 
it ' s the hong kong government uh that will not allow her to stay
until she ' s sixty-five 
 no no no no we never specify how how how old and
 and and they ought to be
 
 mr lam i am sorry to interrupt but why are then are
you exempting those under the general labour importations scheme and
 not the low paid foreign workers for example 
 that that 
 uhm 
there is a fine difference between the two groups because under the
uh general labour importation scheme we have been saying publicly that we
would not normally renew the uh contracts of these imported workers after
they their third term which means that none of them can stay behind after six
years practically but we have not set such as limit for foreign domestic
helpers and that ' s why we are drawing this particular line
but let me emphasize i mean this i in effect most
of the foreign domestic helpers will be exempted uh because of the uh uh
income floor that we are suggesting and in effect most of the
employers of these domestic helpers will only be contributing about fifty odd
dollars a month and which is really a very very minor percentage of the
uh salary that the employer has to pay
but as a matter of principle as a matter of principle we are saying
that anyone who is economically active in the community and getting wages and
income out of the community ought to also bear this obligation as a member of
the society
 
but wouldn't it be better for people to be able to walk out if
they don't think they are going to stay
i mean sometimes people are going to be paying double
they are going to be paying into an existing pension scheme and
another compulsory one and they may not be staying anyway 
 uhm 
we have considered this option but uh the reality outside in the
private sector is that most if not all of the private retirement schemes
they give lump sum payments upon retirement or upon the departure of the
employees from these companies
and given the rate of change of jobs of hong kong people in many
instances this lump sump doesn't mean a lot of things to the people who
retire
and we are saying that even for those who have this benefit of lump
sum retirement schemes and bear in mind that ' s only one third of the working
population even for these with lump sum protection it is quite
complimentary to for them to also have a regular pension payment because
after all not all people would be able to manage their own lump sum
investment uh to keep you know the rest of their retirement life to be to
have a adequate protection
so at one point five percent of contribution we do suggest that
it is a worth in worthwhile investment
mr lam every once in a while i get the feeling that the
government ' s left hand doesn't know what its right hand is doing and in
this particular case i am getting that feeling again 
uh going back to foreign domestic helpers you know the director
of immigration will not allow them to stay until they are sixty-five
in fact they have to leave within two weeks of the expiration of
their contract so how how can you say that they have to pay but they
cannot possibly see any benefits uh when they retire
now tha that ' s uh uh at one point
and the second point a about the left hand not knowing
what the right hand is doing is uh the government previously has been
encouraging private companies to set up their own retirement schemes 
what you are proposing today is uh going to discourage companies
from setting up their private schemes
now frank you ' ve i think you ' ve mixed up the information 
foreign domestic helpers have to leave hong kong only if they have
not got their jobs and we have never said that you know you must leave in
six years ' time like what we have said to the imported labour 
 no you have to leave in two weeks ' time
no that ' s only if they cannot get their contract renewed
yes and then what about all all the money they have
already paid in
now this is a social insurance scheme
if you go to uk and work they may not allow you to stay on forever
but you ' ve got to contribute because that is the obligation as an active uh
member of the economy and this principle applies to many countries 
 uh as well so we are not exceptional
we are not exceptional
 so this is so this is really 
uh this is really a tax that they have to pay
it is a contribution in return for uh an eligibility if you
 are still a member of the community by the time you are eligible and
i emphasize we are not exceptional in this particular respect
go and work elsewhere
you ' ve got to pay whatever they want you to pay in terms of social
security contributions
 
uh mr lam this is expected to start in nineteen ninety-seven at
the earliest when uh hong kong moves into chinese hands
what guarantees will young people who begin to pay into the
pension fund have that they will get the pension in say fifty years ' time
if the community endorses this proposal then we will
proceed with implementing it
we need the time to uh set up the legislative and executive
frameworks 
we estimate that it would need at least a couple of years to get
all those things ready but once it ' s up there and running uh there ' s no
reason why it would not keep on running and uh i would suggest that uh this
would then form part of the hong kong community ' s uhm social security scheme
and it would be a long term scheme
 two-words 
 
 china doesn't sound very encouraging 
exactly 
 well we have yet to discuss with them uh over
the details
we uh obviously would like to uh convince them that this is a good
scheme for the uh elderly people of hong kong and good for the uh uh harmony
of the society in the future 
uh it ' s too early days yet to say that they don't like it
 
emily lau the independent legislator has said the government
hasn't got the will to push it through anyway so in fact it ' s a waste of
time
the timetable ' s too tight
what ' s your response to that 
if you read back carefully f from the day
when i make my last statement in december last year to now it only took us
 slightly more than six months and we ' ve come out with a very
comprehensive set of proposal 
now isn't that determination
isn't that efficiency
 isn't that 
 why didn't you propose this ten years ago
why why wait until the eve of nineteen ninety-seven
frank i suppose you can say that to anything under the 
 sun but let ' s look at let let ' s let ' s look at the fact
twenty years ago ageing is not a priority problem for the
community but now this problem has come up catch up with us like many
other societies
we ' ve got to face it
if you don't face today you have to face tomorrow
it ' s as just a matter of fact
 
 i ' m afraid we ' re running out of time mr lam so if
you can be brief 
thank you mr lam
