 dim   this cantonese word literally stands for a spot, but
in this context it refers to how  uh

 no  
""
it  ' s a  united world

""

""
uh how about you when   you  ' ve  
""
""
 i  ' ve been   here for almost two years and i  ' m
studying medicine
 
""
medicine
""
so you  ' re going to be a doctor 
""
""
hopefully
 
""
yeah
""
it take  it takes a long time
""
i think   it  ' s  hard work 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah
 
""
yeah okay alright  one-word 
""
uh  in your classes  what languages
""
i know hong kong u university is supposed to be an english
language university
""
but i know that in many classes  there is a lot of cantonese
use  also by the teacher
""
  is  that correct 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
uhm
""
not in my class   i think 
""
most of them they  they use  the whole lecture is conducted
in english
 
""
 no  
""
it is 
""
""
but of course we students we speak   in cantonese
""
""
or sometime   if we  have question we maybe
""
some of them may ask in cantonese   to the  lecturer
  and after  class
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
do you have any foreign lecturers 
""
""
yeah
 
""
  france 
""
  uh  a   lot 
""
where 
""
""
 a lot  
""
 from  
""
 from  
""
italy from australia
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
england
 
""
uhm uhm
""
uhm how about in your classes 
""
""
uh i think  most most of them uhm english uh teach in
english
""
uhm but uhm there is some exceptions
""
uhm sometimes the lecturers may speak in cantonese
""
and  and for the  tu  tutorial   uhm  the
tutor usually uhm 
""
some some of them will speak uh cantonese
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah but uhm  but i think uhm it  ' s uhm 
""
we can all all of them all of us uh can also  hear uh hear
english have with no problems
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
yes i think
 
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm
""
is it difficult to write papers in english 
""
""
uhm
 
""
do you have papers to write 
""
""
yes of course
""
  uhm   mostly no not different because uh no i
think
""
uhm i mean no not difficult uh because  we all we are almost
uhm
""
if we always uh write english during our secondary school 
 uhm    so  yes
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah   
""
""
 i  
""
i think a problem for hong kong student     are
mostly in speaking   english 
""
like they don't have the  courage
""
they   they  they start uhm using english in the
""
they start learning english since their  since their
kindergarten    
""
so i think they  their writing ability  ' s good   is
well  enough
""
  but  their speaking they don't have the chance to
 speak to others   in english 
""
  they don't  use it and they don't have the courage
to use it
""
and so i think the  most  the main problem in hong kong
student is the speaking english
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
well okay
""
but do you have uh
""
do have any foreign students in your classes 
""
""
yeah
 
""
there were many 
""
""
not many
""
like   ten  less than ten percent
 
""
 uhm  
""
from where
""
where did   they come from  
""
""
 from india   mainly
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
but they  they educated they are educated in hong kong
 
""
okay 
""
""
so their parents       are in hong
kong
""
no  in my class
 
""
 right   
""
""
 your secondary school or university oh  
""
oh yeah
 
""
what about in your classes  your   foreign  
""
""
 uhm   i think most of them are local students
 
""
yeah 
""
""
uhm few of them from other countries
""
uhm so we we still have little chance to speak with uhm foreigners
""
""
so
 
""
you have many students from uhm other provinces of china
""
uh do you have uh  students from uh 
""
""
china
 
""
da lu  putonghua=china  from the mainland of china with
 uhm 
""
from vietnam or you have many putonghua speakers    
in your classes 
""
""
 yes  
""
yes
 
""
do they speak cantonese 
""
""
uhm  uhm i think  si  still not uhm quite large
number of these   students 
""
uhm they they have  learns  little  can  cantonese
  uhm but  they  uhm major uhm most of most time they speak
in uhm putonghua
 
""
 yeah  
""
 did they  
""
how was their english 
""
""
uhm not so good i   think 
""
yeah
 
""
 yeah  
""
yeah 
""
""
uhm in my class they can they can speak  canton 
cantonese quite well i think
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and   their 
 
""
 you   mean the putonghua people   can 
speak cantonese   also 
""
okay 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
and their english is  i don't know
""
uhm but i  tut  i think it  ' s just their accent make it
strange strange to me
""
  i i  think their  can  english is quite well
also    
""
it  ' s just the accent    si si    to 
strange
 
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
 uh ha  
""
