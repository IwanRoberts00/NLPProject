over  taiwan   and  and  i think maybe  because of
historical reasons

 uhm

school conversation and everything but uhm  without asking you to  make
an official statement

can i speak

i think so  
""
""
 yeah  of course  
""
yes
""
""
because  it  ' s because uhm the  united states
interfered in the event   and  i guess  so most hong kong
people  has the feeling against the us because   why  why 
do they  bother her 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  yeah  
""
exactly yeah i
""
a lot of people  well i haven't been home for a long time but
a lot of people in the us think the same thing    
""
the moment that you send off a huge aircraft carrier  
  that costs a huge amount of money and then everyone says how long
is that aircraft carrier going to stay there  with all those ships because
they are floating around but  they cost thousands  if  millions of
dollars     every every week probably more than a million
dollars a week 
""
""

""
""
 uh uh  
""
""
especially with the memory of the vietnam war
 
""

kong and observing it  from a much closer distance you know from 
compare to others
""
i don't know
""
do 
""
will it
""
so do you have any other thoughts about that or 
""
""

 uhm uhm  
""
 uh uh  
""
yes i  ' ve  paid  respects to ancestors but  i i won't go
to the chinese temple to pray for  something   because   i
don't believe it
 
""
 right  
""
cos you don't believe in it uh 
""
""
no
 
""
is that  a recent thing
""
did you believe in it when you were a little kid and then you
changed 
""
or did you never really  sort of 
""
""
i never  really
 
""
right 
""

""
uh   oh  
""
""
 it  ' s   it  ' s the chinese medicine for  uhm
 s  uhm  for the  for the illness of  stomach   
 but  but it is very traditional because uhm  they they are
arranged in a  pocket   and  when there  is something like
 uhm  dusts
 
""
""
 oh  
""
 yeah  
""
uh uh 
""
""
 laughs  i don't know how to   explain  just
 just a kind of uhm chinese type medicine
 
""
 uhm  
""
uh uh  so but it  ' s inside the little pocket and then  
  how is it served
""

""
""
 yeah  
""
oh it it  ' s it  ' s just uhm add in some  uhm hot water and it  ' s

""
""
powder or
""
""

""
does it work  laughs  
""

not to try it because i i   don't  i don't really much believe in
it
 
""
 oh  
""
right 
$a-laughs 
""
right but i mean they say
""
i mean i have been told that apart from the medicines that
sometimes kill people by accident  laughs  apart from those you know
""
aw oh that  ' s in the news too 
""
but apart from that they say that some of the chinese medicines
are very effective
""
isn't that true or 
""
""
but i think it  ' s it  ' s quite uhm  effective because if it
is if it isn't  effective uhm i think the company will  will you know
 
""
yeah that the company would fold   or  something
""
yes  
""
""
 yeah  so it   it has lasted for about  i
wonder maybe forty years    just  uhm because  i i counted
from nineteen forty and   right  now is ninety something so i
think     it has lasted for so many years
 
""
 wow wow  
""

""
 yeah  
""
uhm  so do you have like  any interesting stories in your
  family background  like

""
oh yeah
 
""
you do 
""
""

""
i mean 
""
""
a very interesting story
""
uhm  when i  uh when i was born   be  because i
was born in nineteen seventy-four    
""
just at this year uhm there  ' s a  big crush down in stock
market   and  and my father  had invested in it and bought
the the houses   all  the houses all my mother  ' s jewelry in
order to     to uhm to invest in the stock market  
but actually  there  ' s a big crisis     at in nineteen
forty-seven and  unlucky i was born this year     and my
grand    grand  grandmother   uhm quite accuses of of
 of me being the unlucky one    
""
they they they  they regard me as uhm something like  i
don't know how to  say in  english but  i know how to say in chinese
 
""
 uh uh  
""
 uh uh  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uh oh  
""
 yeah  
""
 oh     laughs 
""
yeah  
""
 oh  
""
uh uhm 
""
""
 hak sing 
 
""
hak   hak sing  
""
""
uh that means something uh very bad luck  and you you you
""
$z-laughs  you
""
yeah so i i  ' m very  you know
""
i am very  i don't know how to describe my feelings but
actually my grand grandmother doesn't  like me very much   up 
till now
 
""
 why  
""
really
""
is she still alive your grandmother 
""
""
yeah   but  but uhm she  ' s about  eighty
years old but but she has a lot of  illnesses    
""
yeah but  but actually uhm  even even in the new lunar new
year i have visited her but actually he she really is not not really want to
    see me actually     so uhm
 
""
 she is  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 wow  
""
what is now is that the one that you are named after
""
why why change 
""
""
yeah   just the same 
 
""
 it  ' s just the same   one 
""
""
the same one
 
""
why would she 
""
i  ' m just curious because why would she why would she be like
that
""
i know that sometimes people   just don't  get along
 you know but  but is there any particular reason why  she  ' s 
""
is she jealous of you or something 
""
""
 yeah  
""
no  just because uhm  uhm the decision to to decide my name
is uhm is my grandpa to decide  my name but  but actually my
grandmother  doesn't really like     doesn't  really care
about me
 
""
 yeah  
""
uh   uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
oh   well  
""
""
 i think    she is a kind of traditional 
kind of chinese     to believe in something like uhm it was i
i don't know how to say just i think  she  she thinks uhm  i i i
cannot say  maybe uhm  i  ' m  wholly responsible for   
 for the  you know for the breakdown     the fall
down of the family
 
""
 oh  
""
 oh  
""
 uhm  
""
wow oh uh
""
i don't know
""
i mean that  ' s 
""
it  ' s very hard to  i mean i must say that it  ' s rather hard
to
""
you could also come up with a different story just as easily 
   you know
""
you could say that  you know good things and bad things come
together     and maybe there was a bad thing and that and the
good thing
""
you are the good thing 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah so 
$z-laughs  so i i i  ' m quite  i don't know how to say but i think 
my my father has  experienced a lot because     before 
he has uhm he has his own company     uhm  uhm my my
father and mother lives in a quite large house but but finally comes out 
with everything has been lost and     maybe  maybe from a
a a quite upper class and then  falls down into the middle class so i i
think  they they have  a lot of pressure but   actually 
right now my  father  doesn't really blame me for anything  
  but he but actually he quite  cares about  my  future

 uhm  
""
 oh  
""
 yeah  
""
yeah 
""
well surely i mean  you  ' re here at the university  
and  that  ' s a very good thing    to do
""
yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yes maybe   it maybe  to me it  ' s a kind of
responsibility     actually
 
""
 uhm  
""
so what do you think
""
how would you uh you know  three words 
""
how would you act on that responsibility
""
what are your future plans
""
 wh  what do you want to do 
""
""
i think i  i will find a good job  and   i  ' ll
  i  ' ll  laughs  give as much as money to them
""
  that  ' s all  i have 
""
  i have  and and also  get a good husband 
 actually 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 and   get a good husband 
$b-laughs 
""
yeah of of course
""
of course 
""
those are all desirable things
""
so  do you do you think that  the university is a good
place  you know   to  
""
""
 to   find a good husband
 
""
 laughs  i mean i don't mean it
""
i don't mean it in that way  laughs  exact
""
i don't mean exactly like that but do you think that  uhm 
well the university is a good place to find   a good job   from
right
""
you can cos you got from here with a hku degree  that  ' s very
prestigious isn't it 
""
do you think
""
yeah i think so
""
and  what area of work would you hope to work in 
""
""
 yeah  yeah   
""
yes
""
i think i i want  i want to  be a teacher
 
""
ah wow
""
oh wow  laughs 
""
uhm even though 
""
does a teacher make a lot of money here or 
""
""
no  not   not  because of the money but 
   but  but i i think i want to be a teacher but i  i know
i  i wouldn't be a good teacher  but
 
""
 no  
""
 uhm  
""
oh no
""
why do you say that  laughs 
""
surely it  ' s not true 
""
""
yes because   i  ' m  not  i am not smart in my
academic  studies   so i i 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 oh you don't   have to be smart to be a teacher
 laughs 
""
no no  laughs  
""
""
but  but actually  i think  to be a teacher you must
be have good academic  results and i i  ' m not  that kind of   
so 
 
""
 uh uhm
""
oh   well
""
yeah but still
""
if you if you were successful n becoming a teacher then it
doesn't matter what your academic results are  you know as long as it  ' s
good enough for you     and as long as it  ' s only good enough
to get you into teaching  then you  ' re a teacher 
$a-laughs 
""
and  and then it depends on what do you do with the class
""
do you like children 
""

you want to teach

""

""
yeah
""

""
it  ' s a very serious subject to ask you all these questions about
your     future plans and   things 
""
do you  do you have a job now  do you do any teaching now
""
""
i mean you can    three-words

""
uh
