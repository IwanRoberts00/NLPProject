what what we  ' ve got to discuss is uhm the uh language survey we
carry out in the next weeks and uh i guess we  ' ve got a number of things to
discuss
""
i think the first thing we can start by discussing would be the the
questionnaire because it  ' s important to get that right and  then later on
perhaps we can discuss the timetable when we  ' re uh  when we  ' re going to
uh when we  ' re going to do when we  ' re going to do this
""
okay uhm so uh michelle has been looking through the questionnaire
and checking parts of questionnaire and i just
""
maybe we can just start of with uh some questions uh from you about
varies points come or some  of the   items  
""
""
 yes   uhm i  ' ve checked over ninety percent i think
just a few more pages to go
""
uhm i realize there are some discrepancies between the chinese
version and the english version   and  the main thing that  ' s
been going through the the whole questionnaire is the inconsistent use of
putonghua and mandarin   the  term
""
so at the beginning of the questionnaire of the english part it is
used in uhm term putonghua   but  then later part of it it
change to mandarin again
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
in the   english 
 
""
 gwok yuh   
""
""
in the english
 
""
oh in   english  
""
""
 so   i think we   have  already
agreed in our last meeting that we are going to use the term putonghua 
 instead  of mandarin
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
 
""
well i think the most important thing is inconsistent
""
so  probably say do we expected is any difference of people
perception of the two 
 
""
i think the main difference is that uhm  uh  these days
people would uh use the term putonghua but twenty years ago the term mandarin
or gwok yuh was a good deal more common than uh this today 
 
""
  but  is it just commonest or is it uh any difference
in the interpretation 
""
""
 yes  
 
""
well historically uh gwok yuh had  one word 
with taiwan and the the standard use in taiwan   perhaps  you know
that that would be gwok yuh it  ' s the pre nineteen forty   nine 
""
 
""
 uh  
""
 would   which would you would you make the difference
between the term 
""
""
  i can  make a difference but i would prefer
mandarin
 
""
 yeah   
 
""
why would you prefer the term uh   mandarin  
""
""
 putonghua   is just a english  okay what can i
say just uh pinyin uhm po tong hua
 
""
po tong hua 
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 yeah   alright but uhm but if if you are describing
where mainland is spoken which is say uh he  ' s speaking putonghua or he  ' s
speaking mandarin 
""
""
uh ha but i guess putonghau is not english isn't it
 
""
yes it  ' s
""
oh you mean is the word english
""
yes it is yeah it  ' s it  ' s been in oxford english dictionary now
""
""
""
yeah   uh 
 
""
 yeah   it  ' s been in   oxford yeah  
 
""
 but as you  ' re speak   did somebody in cantonese about
mainlander and uh when they ask to what language do you speak to mainlander
""
what how would you expect them to ask this question 
""
""
in cantonese
 
""
yes 
""
""
they will use putonghua
 
""
okay we  ' re mainly concern were it yes so i mean   
sorry
""
don't  worry about that liam because because the term
putonghua is used in english as   you know     and it
  
 
""
 so oh   
""
""
 uh ha  
 
""
 well   but it is it  ' s two separate question as you
know
""
one is what we use in chinese and the other one is what do we use
in english 
""
""
and   i think  nowadays in this past seven to ten
years people are tend to use more and more on a term putonghua
""
""
 right  
""
and and   in  cantonese   as well  
""
""
 in  
""
 in cantonese   as well   yes 
 
""
 but   as far as english is concerned i think that
should be putonghua   now  
 
""
 right   and the same for  and the same for
cantonese   and  liam would agreed with that in cantonese 
 and so  important   uh
""
you would say gwok yuh  two words   
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 so you you  ' re you
""
so you agree with   cantonese   you just 
learn through about   english
""
am i right  okay 
""
""
 yes  
 
""
 yeah yeah that  ' s correct  
""
that  ' s correct
""
okay
""
uhm so why don't we take it why don't we just could
""
why don't we just correct this question now   if  you
take it
""
if michelle     takes us through those questions
and just points out which one they are   okay  
""
""
  far   
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 okay  
""
even the minors   so 
 
""
 yes     yes  
""
""
 okay  
""
uh  on the cantonese version the fifth question uh the seventh
items that term is shum shui po in cantonese but the the wording is i mean
the character   is not  correct
""
so it  ' s actually a minor one we can i can write it down later
 
""
 uhm   
 
""
  okay  
 
""
 alright   can you can you spot that later
""
  do you know which character  
""
""
 it should one with   the  one word
  tou   this cantonese word refers to earth 
is it   yup 
 
""
 because it  ' s  
""
""
 yes  
 
""
 two words  it should be right 
""
""
yes
 
""
because we set of   this  question we send this file to
 to you so you have that on your computer and maybe perhaps 
""
""
 set  
 
""
then what what happen would  there was
""
i mean i don't know  whe  whether the problem is it
""
it could be there order long uh could it be i know there was some
problem because the way the file was saved was in in a   quote  in
extended column i think 
 
""
 quote  
""
  but but what  ' s  i  ' m what  ' s i  ' m saying  
anyway is is  is this point
""
what i  ' m saying is that uhm liam can make its correction to the
version you  ' ve   got  
 
""
  it is all   
""
  two words   
""
 well   we can ask oh we can ask from the secretary
  until when he back
""
so as long as  as long as we have one copy maybe we we use
your one as mark type 
 
""
 oh the secretary will make the  corrections   
""
""
yes   yes i can make  it
""
i mean   look  more decent     
 okay 
 
""
 that  ' s the best  
""
 sure  
""
 yeah   
 
""
 okay   alright fine so
""
alright so that  ' s that was question number 
""
""
  fifth 
""
""
 five 
""
  yes 
 
""
 five  
""
 i told   you number seven
""
  something  ' s uh 
""
sorry if if we could we are going through just ask the  uh
""
""
sorry yeah okay coming 
 
""
 yeah that  ' s  right    
""
""
okay and then uhm is is the english version page two  
 bottom  
 
""
 do you   want to go through the chinese version or
have you been through it all or already 
 
""
well we are   going to  two words  
""
 
""
 are there more are there   more   questions
 
""
""
 on   the can uh chinese   version 
""
uh yes but i think it  ' s better   if we cross reference
yeah 
""
okay so uh question number fourteen  okay
""
uh the code number twelve code twelve the tertiary post secondary
student but on the chinese version is  daaih jyun sang  
these cantonese words refer to post-secondary students   yihn gau
sang   these cantonese words refer to postgraduate students 
""
 yihn gau sang   these cantonese words refer to
postgraduate students  i would understand it as postgraduate student
instead of post-secondary student
 
""
 yeah  
""
 alright okay alright alright okay  
 
""
 yeah i think so   
 
""
uhm 
 
""
uh it should i think it should be post-secondary
""
in fact it  ' s a big problem in hong kong the distinction of
tertiary and post-secondary   they just  
 
""
 why don't   we just say tertiary student and that
would include    cause a bit  close  
 
""
 well i think  
""
i think you should say tertiary or post-secondary 
""
""
then i think the the chinese term should be  daaih
jyun sang   these cantonese words refer to post-secondary students
 and  jyun seuhng hohk yun hohk saang   the meaning of
these cantonese words is post- secondary students  something like that
""
  because  post-secondary college would be  jyun
seuhng hohk yun   these cantonese words refer to post-secondary
college 
 
""
 yeah   
 
""
liam agree 
""
""
i agree
 
""
because the the in fact we wouldn't get on they don't agree on
that kind of   institution  post and tertiary   so 
""
 
""
 uhm  
""
 well   spotted uh michelle 
""
""
thank you
 
""
we  fully  move on
""
uhm  i don't know what it is because it  ' s about moving the
question around
""
the question thirteen  is conditionally has been had ship on
two on two wider head of head uh attend the secondary school
""
and it seems a little bit odd in a way we haven't asked the
question about whether you have children
""
am i right    
""
is there somebody in the in the democratic 
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
""
""
i don't think that  ' s   a question  yeah 
""
that question we never ask
""
for those we never ask in ninety three  ninety or 
 
""
 we never ask that question right  
""
so logically we should least ask the question uhm 
 
""
do you have children 
 
""
yes do you have children 
 
""
so question number
""
okay so after after question number twelve we need a question uh
 do you have 
 
""
well yeah i was i was wondering in fact in the past i would say
we can ask are you married
""
but i think we should ask it as a separate question 
 
""
do you have children 
 
""
yes 
 
""
yeah 
 
""
i mean in fact we can make it only first eighteen and above
""
oh cause we haven't any age question here right
""
the age we still have got seven as the age question
""
so we could say basically the age is at least sixteen   
""
""
it  ' s over sixteen then after you have children 
""
actually even it  ' s given the this next yeah okay
""
and then if you have children uhm  so then nine would not be
breakable because children too young alright 
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
 
""
because either that the right age or the worse wide age and that
that should be are are strength thirteen that make senses 
""
""
uhm uhm uhm
 
""
okay well i think alright we will we will redo this
""
we will redo both english version and chinese version and send
new version to you
""
that will     that will do it
""
okay so you you want to continue 
 
""
 okay  
""
uh   that  ' s right  
""
""
 okay and   then the next one would be 
question number twenty four on the chinese version 
""
uhm repeated word phrase here
""
it should be uhm  a cantonese sentence 
""
the repeated phrase is  ging seuhng   they refer
to often  often
""
  how  often do you hear people often use  
cantonese and 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 so just delete   one from here   right 
""
""
""
 yeah   just delete the second one   i think
 
 
""
 second one  
""
  okay  fine 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
can i take it back to the language record from  uhm
""
the my concern is uh we  ' re trying to address any issue that
overlap which i think  cause been a problem in the past
""
at the moment it  ' s so cantonese and then cantonese dialect and
then sze yup
""
now you have to correct this sze yup is a cantonese dialect right
 or not 
 
""
yes this  ' s ususally treated uh     separately in
the hong kong census 
 
""
 separately  
""
but then the question   is  
 
""
 but   i think it  ' s historically issue for that and i
think that because in the fifties and sixties when  uhm the census when
 one word  was doing his   work  they were
quite significantly    would  you know  
 
""
 right  
""
 well i don't  
""
this i guess the issue first of all we ordering of this term
because it  ' s supplied in several places   and the  secondly do
we are we really then asking cantonese sze yup other kinds of these dialects
""
or it  ' s even   treat now   two words
 dialect because the
""
we just want to try make it uhm  unique also i think from the
given language spoken 
 
""
 right  
""
 oh i see  
""
alright but i think we should delete i see your point is i think
we should delete two chinese cantonese dialects 
""
""
so
 
""
just cantonese
""
or do you
""
because  i don't think we getting much we don't the we don't
get any result according to  several words  
 
""
so you now you mean you just place cantonese and then sze yup 
 and putonghua as well  
 
""
 yeah that  ' s right   yeah 
 
""
so which   which  
 
""
 i think   it run in the original nineteen eighty
three uh survey we had a question about standard cantonese and then cantonese
dialects 
 
""
well we can oh we can put them in cantonese option uh if you
think people can make the distinction there  ' s no problem
""
i  ' m not trying to say we should make less distinction i  ' m just
saying we should try to make it clearer     where the dividing
  lines  
 
""
 yeah  
""
 well   i don't know i mean    i  
 
""
 well    i  ' m the  chinese 
 
""
liam did your parents
""
liam uh 
""
""
speak in english
 
""
no no
""
your parents uhm  is your mother or your father come from
china 
""
""
no
 
""
both born in hong kong 
""
""
one in hong kong and one in malaysia
 
""
i see right
""
uhm michelle what do you think
""
do you think uh you  ' re right calling at your home and you  ' re
saying to them uh you know which languages just use
""
a word you have mainland chinese as far as calling
""
which language is to used when you  ' re speaking with them
""
is guangdong hua
""
and then how would you expect cantonese dialects  in chinese
or was   chinese  
""
""
 guangdong   hua
 
""
what   what  ' s  one word  two  
 
""
 what were   we have this    this chinese are
 
""
""
 uh guangdong    fong yihn  
these cantonese words refer to dialects 
""
 keih ta   these cantonese words refer to the
others  guangdong    fong yihn   these
cantonese words refer to dialects 
 
""
 several words  yeah
""
would people know what you meant  or people about only have
 one word  idea   about  
""
""
 i   doubt
""
because probably they will just consider all  con 
cantonese dialects as cantonese
 
""
right
""
so do you think we can remove that second    uh 
without without lose any information
""
yeah 
""
""
 i think so  
 
""
well the other related question is whether this  one
word  at all
""
right 
 
""
yeah 
 
""
i  ' m sure it  ' s would not be  one word  cause
it  ' s long list 
 
""
right 
 
""
so the  so what we say now we will keep sze yap and chiu chau
in that 
 
""
yeah 
 
""
but we just delete it sort of generic cantonese dialects is that
right 
 
""
yeah i think so 
 
""
does it make sense in in term of chinese version of questionnaire
""
 
""
well cause we  ' ve   got other other translate  next
down  several words     put it  down 
""
""
""
 it  ' s fine it  ' s fine  
 
""
 yes  
""
that one  ' s fine because it specifically the other and it comes
at the end of the list certainly
""
my assumption is cause normally what happen this we will has the
list of code on the screen with a label on it and able up to see which one
apply 
 
""
right 
 
""
so  ignore is the left of the chinese dialects it is it is
some point chinese is not on the list 
 
""
right
""
no i think that would be fine
""
the only thing there  ' s got spelling of chiu chau i think in the
census and statistics these days they use c h i u c h a u which is this
cantonese romanization 
 
""
really 
""
we got  this uh  
""
""
 c h   a u
""
yeah
 
""
and   this     one word 
 
 
""
 well   
""
""
 okay 
 
""
 and   it  ' s two words 
""
""
it is   two words 
 
""
  normally yeah    
 
""
and also i think we should change hokken to hakken i think  a
long pause 
""
uhm  okay we should again we follow the census of statistics
department actually
""
hokken apparently is the term it is used by speakers of fujian
dialects from  uh  fujian province to describe their own dialect 
  
""
so that what  ' s the term hokken as well
""
and in hong kong used to have a several group of people when
 three words  you know so basically they are fujian people
or fuijian people and then just the label so many of them
""
i mean i we also got some  two words 
""
we got uh shanghaiese well okay hakka okay but we also got uhm
 shangdong and tinjian 
 
""
 i see  
""
are we include   according to  centre we mark it on the
 census one 
 
""
  one word   
""
no these these are the  char 
""
these are the lists that we have in previously in the  
first  survey
""
so i mean i   think  
 
""
 alright  
""
 which   i think actually come from what kind of
people sort of describing uh what   describe  
 
""
 no   it wasn't
""
  it  ' s a  list that uh my colleague my  
collegaue yeah yeah
""
so  uhm i think we should actually i mean i think we could i
think we could delete   this  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 oh good
""
 the case are 
""
alright  
""
 from   shanghaiese half   to shanghaiese
""
""
so delete that shandong     tinjian  
henan  
 
""
 yeah   
""
""
 so  
 
""
 tinjian   hunan yes 
 
""
  right  
""
""
 shandong   tinjian and henan   go 
 
""
 yup   yup 
 
""
okay 
 
""
are there any other other any other dialect on the on the  
on that  
 
""
 sze yap   is not on their list
""
presumably on their argument that is part of the cantonese right
""
otherwise supposed to the same
""
you  ' re right
""
so fujian including  tai  in fact they say specifically
including taiwanese
""
maybe we need to state that and do we 
 
""
no this   this  
 
""
 or   you don't want to include   this uh 
""
 
""
 this need   uh this just need uh yeah
""
uhm right let let  ' s let  ' s delete the uh actually i mean it  ' s
supposed uh   i think  let  ' s throw that actually  
 two words   
""
""
 oh  
""
""
 so uh   there  ' ll be cantonese putonghua
chiuchau fujian hakka and shanghaiese
 
""
and   then other chinese  dialects 
""
""
 other chinese  
""
okay
""
  that  we will be back
 
""
 yup  
""
then we can match the  one word  to the census
then 
 
""
right
""
okay uhm 
 
""
okay
""
sorry uh 
""
""
it  ' s   okay 
 
""
 you   work to twenty four 
""
""
okay uhm next one is twenty five chinese version
""
uhm the four uh code four uhm   a cantonese sentence 
here means never heard of but according to the question is about uh 
having  how often do you yourself mix english and chinese
""
so i would change it to  a cantonese sentence  never use it
myself
 
""
uh which item is this   which question  
 
""
 twenty five   
""
""
two
 
""
the last
""
now how you how you translate never
""
so if talking about you yourself and you use different
description i mean if you talk how the people you know how the  pe 
alright 
""
""
uhm
 
""
so that  ' s how the   mean 
""
so that  ' s applied to twenty five twenty six and twenty seven
right
""
oh sorry twenty five and twenty seven alright 
 
""
 right   
""
""
twenty five and twenty seven yes  a long pause  uh
 
""
hang on just uh and just
""
sorry can you just 
""
""
okay so the next one is number  uh the chinese version
thirty one and thirty two
""
the options there are mixed up
""
uh the thirty two options should the code one to seventy and
ninety nine should go up to question number thirty one instead of the other
way round
""
now it is upside down
""
okay uh chinese version number thirty one and number thirty two
and it is different a little bit different to the to the options available in
the english version
""
some are missing like uhm french german spanish portuguese other
european languages japanese korean malay thai indonesian philippine other
asian  lang  languages up to not applicable for those are missing
 
""
and also there  ' s a different list in thirty one and thirty two
is it    two words   
""
""
 yes that they   mix up
 
""
and also there  ' s different list as well i mean in  in this
 thir  i mean thirty one we got sixteen different options and in and
in thirty two we got twenty five different options 
""
""
yes they are different because the question being asked are
different
""
because on  thir  thirty one    is about 
foreigners   talking  to foreigners and then thirty two is about
talking to colleagues or floors of hong kong people   
""
so  they are different
 
""
 oh i see yes  
""
 yeah  
""
 okay  
""
but why would   why  
 
""
 maybe   why unnecessary complicated i think by having
different lists 
""
alright my my preference would be we  so the chinese that we
we basically have a chinese list and a non chinese list 
 
""
yeah   i mean 
""
can we just say right now we we we need to we need to standardise
this
""
and let  ' s come back to this later on okay 
""
""
 uhm  
""
okay
 
""
we need to standardise this list    one word
  okay and come back to that later on
""
uh please continue michelle 
""
""
 okay  
""
okay
""
and then question number thirty two english version 
""
the phrase at work are repeated
""
at work which languages do you used at work when you  ' re speaking
to   a friend 
 
""
 okay   fine 
""
""
uhm and then number thirty seven
""
uhm i realize the code is different for not application
""
the chinese version is nine and the english version is ninety nine
""
so i doubt if it will make   con  will be a bit
confusing when they    it be    form  
 
""
 shouldn't be nine   
 
""
 is it   special question what is it sorry 
""
""
""
thirty seven   question  thirty seven
""
  the  last option
""
the code number is nine on chinese and ninety nine on english
version
 
""
 thirty  
""
 right   
 
""
the english is right in  this time
""
cause nine is  cause nine is korean right 
""
""
 uh so it should be ninety nine  
 
""
yeah
""
okay fine 
""
""
and then question forty three  eng  english version
 question forty three
""
uhm the phrase if yes to question forty one should be deleted 
because it should be actually no for   those  who answer no in
question number forty one
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
why
""
chat on with mainland chinese people
""
if you say no then why you ask me if you have friends who are
mainland chinese
""
""
it  ' s actually i i guess it  ' s separate question so after
they answer question forty one
""
if they yes they would have a follow up question
""
if no if they they don't have any uhm contact with mainland
chinese then next question for them would be number   forty 
 
""
 i uh   i think if   if  piece of error
but the wrong   one
""
i think  error is in forty one    
""
because the assumption is you don't have contact when you seldom
contact friends 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 it  ' s wrong yeah  we   
""
 yeah  
""
right
""
  uhm  should go to question
""
""
 uh ha  
 
""
so should go to forty   five if  you say now
""
and then you  ' re right actually if yes to question forty one it  ' s
it  ' s irrelevant because what uhm we get to this 
""
""
 forty five  
""
yes
 
""
well let  ' s then we leave that
""
those just need to fix then we go to after forty one no should go
forty five 
""
""
okay
 
""
we can delete anyway we can delete that if yes to question 
 
""
uh i know that  ' s talk speaking correct 
 
""
alright   okay  fine 
 
""
 fine  
""
okay we get it okay alright
""
okay michelle 
""
""
okay so no error on question forty three
""
it  ' s the only thing that have to amend is question forty one
""
if no go to question forty five
 
""
correct
""
that is good 
""
""
and then   uhm 
 
""
 i mean   i have to change that into chinese  
or not okay  
""
""
 yes i  ' ve   marked it down
""
and then the next one is question forty seven as well so that that
phrase should be or if yes to question number forty  a long pause 
 
""
yes against forty five is the same alright
""
  forty  five should go to forty nine if you say
  no  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 forty   nine yeah  a long pause 
""
and then question forty nine chinese version 
""
uh the english language soundtrack uhm should be translated as
 ying mahn deui baahk   these cantonese words refer to
english dialogue  instead of  ying mahn yuhn sing daaih dihp
  these cantonese words refer to english soundtrack  in this
case
 
""
what do you think liam 
""
""
soundtrack  soundtrack of the movie
""
""
they  ' re talking about the the the the language being 
being used in if you are given the option to choose whether you are going to
listen to chinese or english
""
will you choose chinese or english uh
""
""
but i think the  chines  chinese translation of
soundtrack is  yuhn sing daaih dihp   the meaning of these
cantonese words is soundtrack 
""
""
yes the term soundtrack i mean the own the the phrase the
vocabulary is right    yuhn sing daaih dihp   
the meaning of these cantonese words is soundtrack  but not in this case
be because we are talking about movies not about the music not about the
songs
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm so because i don't know about the background of this question
 
""
well for example liam
""
when you you don't listen right   dear 
""
now if you watch any english language movie liam liam
""
  if  you don't watch english language movie now how
you  how you listen to movie
""
the answer   problem base  here
""
  how do you  how do you
""
liam how do you
""
no i  ' m asking you how do you when you go to the
""
when you  ' re sitting in the cinema and the film is showing and it  ' s
tom cruise or it  ' s nicole kidman or whoever how do you follow them 
""
""
 uh ha  
""
 uhm  
""
 oh  
""
 i see  
""
by hearing and watching
 
""
by hearing and watching 
""
""
yeah
  so do   you 
""
so   liam liam  so do you
""
liam so do you actually listen to the soundtrack or do you watch
the   subtitles  
""
""
 i  
""
 i know now  
""
 i   do both
 
""
you do   both  okay
""
so that  ' s what we want to
""
that  ' s what we want to get out with this question 
several words 
""
  okay so that  ' s
""
you  got it now   okay
""
so that  ' s what we want to  we want to ask the question in
such a way that the people will give us the answer without having to explain
it to them in a way that   i told you  
""
""
 yes  
""
 i  ' ve got it now yeah  
""
 and you don't need  one word   
 
""
 and the question   is like at least in english
post i think it  ' s not completed now
""
what i need to explain is we want to  one word
 cinema and watching a film    right    
 on video or this but the problem is now
""
is that to me the they found that they found somebody who
normally watch cantonese movies that seems a very strange question
""
so it shouldn't shouldn't be when watching english language
movies  or not 
""
""
 uhm uhm 
 
""
 did you  
""
 yeah  
""
i don't know the question a bit confusing to me
""
uhm what to   what will  
 
""
 that is   doesn't make sense in chinese if you make
that term 
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uhm
 
""
liam and may maybe liam and michelle can look at the chinese and
and and how  ' s what you think 
""
""
okay
 
""
i mean what do you think
""
what do you think is the way to ask the question 
""
""
now i understand your point
""
because you want to ask when people watching   movie how
they listen of what  the uh characters are saying
""
i i i know what you mean now
""
because in chinese uhm  ying mahn yuhn sing daaih dihp
  these cantonese words refer to english soundtrack or album of
the movie  means the album   of of  the movie   but
 you you don't want to ask
""
""
 yes instead of uh yes  
""
 yes  
""
 yes  
""
we are not talking about that soundtrack
""
""
so you are right
""
  that should be 
""
""
 so you you agree   that  deui baahk
  the meaning of these cantonese words is dialogue  would be
better instead   of  yuhn sing daaih dihp   these
cantonese words refer to soundtrack or album of the movie 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
 absolutely
""
because   it doesn't make sense    the term 
 in chinese
""
""
 yes yes  
""
yes
 
""
i see and in english i would i suggest maybe we should change it
to dialogue instead of soundtrack 
""
""
i agree yes   because  i mean
""
i understand it because i was in the meeting last time 
""
but do doctor bacon-shone do you think we still need to add in the
 the bits of uh when   watching english  1
 
""
 alright  
""
 i don't know  
""
maybe not
""
the problem actually was say dialogue is i think what we  ' re
thinking of is the same of dvd what can you   choose  which
soundtrack so was it   the same 
""
so problem is the question has multiple meanings depending on the
content 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
yes
 
""
uhm 
""
""
unless you take the movie uhm question been two questions one
of them is that you go to the movies do you read the subtitle and the other
one is that when you watch dvd at home do you select the english uh
soundtrack or dialogue whatever
 
""
but even that  ' s tricky because sometimes you don't have the
choice and the sense   that  maybe no english soundtrack 
 or  maybe no chinese soundtrack 
""
""
 some  
""
 uhm  
""
sometime   yeah 
 
""
 so   what  ' s we really trying to get out is when you
have a choice between   english and chinese  
""
""
 yes like like   cartoon movies like   uh
monster  in uh you  ' ll
""
if you were given a choice whether you are going to choose to
watch the chinese version or the english version
""
  or  three words  
""
""
 yeah i know  
 
""
 but this is this is the   issue i know my son
watchers and it usually it often cantonese against japanese 
""
""
  uh  ha yes
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
and the other one is cantonese against mandarin   so 
""
""
""
 uhm  
""
and that that actually the choice they made will be subjected to
who  ' s doing   the  the choose yes
 
""
 the choosing 
""
it subjects to availability and who to make   choice 
""
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes
 
""
but i don't know maybe we maybe it too complicated 
""
maybe we can just say cinema 
""
""
i see
 
""
i think so too   actually  
 
""
 and   make it dialogue 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
so how often do you listen to english language dialogue when you  ' re
watching movies in the cinema
""
at least that uh     a consistent question i think
that would pretty sure understand 
""
""
 okay  
""
""
yeah
 
""
you think you understand that liam 
""
""
uh
 
""
if we if i ask you that question how often do you listen to
english   language  dialogue when watching movies   in
the cinema  
""
""
 i  
""
 yes of   course because the main problem is the
word soundtrack
 
""
alright 
 
""
so how would the how would that sound in chinese uh
""
michelle how you 
""
""
uhm and now liam and i agree that it should be change to
 deui baahk   these cantonese words refer to dialogue 
 ying yuh deui baahk   these cantonese words refer to
english dialogue 
 
""
uhm uhm okay fine
""
uhm  okay fine
""
uh next point uh 
""
""
next point is question number fifty five the chinese version
""
i will add  a cantonese sentence  and then option one two
three bla bla bla because it  ' s this the
""
what will you do or or the term what do what will you be engaged
in   that  ' s  that bit is missing    for  
""
what do you think liam
 
""
 right  
""
 uhm   
""
""
yes because   they 
 
""
 do   you think we actually need question fifty five
""
""
because isn't it can it make implicate in the answer to fifty six
to fifty eight
""
cause it should only be asked if they say yes to fifty four right
""
 
""
that  ' s correct    
""
we need uh go to question eight we are or statement in here 
""
""
 yes 
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
but then it seem to me it  ' s odd quite to me if ask fifty five
and then ask fifty six to fifty eight 
 
""
alright okay so then why do we just have after fifty four can
  we have  if yes   to  fifty four 
""
""
 and then  
 
""
  one word   
""
then ask 
 
""
fifty six to fifty eight 
 
""
right 
 
""
if no  go to fifty nine
""
is that it 
 
""
yeah and   and that  ' s   quickable  and i will
lock that the com because done years right 
 
""
 unclear> two words   
""
right 
 
""
does that make sense
""
do you like this 
""
""
yes
 
""
okay so uhm 
""
""
and then the next one would be question fifty nine still the
chinese version uhm  we  ' re talking about if your teacher is chinese so
that phrase that part is missing
""
so i add in  a cantonese sentence  make it exactly the same
as question sixty
 
""
that mean you also do not  breakable  you  ' re right
""
there  ' s not a  breakable  missing for of six fifty nine
and sixty 
""
""
yes
 
""
because they may have a net teacher right at least the english
""
 
""
uhm
""
yes
""
okay so standardize that not  one word  in 
in the word that you know three questions fifty nine sixty sixty one
""
uh oh actually may sixty one perhaps not
""
just the sixty fifty nine to sixty   is that right 
""
 
""
 uhm i think   sixty one should yeah 
 
""
yeah 
""
""
okay question number eighty two onwards 
""
uh sometimes the not applicable choice is on the english version
but not on the chinese one
""
like  fif  eighty two eighty three eighty seven  ninety
 a long pause 
""
so i suppose we need to add in the not applicable choice in the
chinese version
 
""
for which question again   sorry  
""
""
 eighty   two eighty three and eighty seven
 
""
what in the english version in the eighty to two not applicable
 and in eighty seven as   well  
""
""
 but   not on the chinese version
 
""
okay 
 
""
actually most of these questions i mean not have applicable
option as well
""
for example eighty six alright so you need not not applicable for
that as well  mobile phone rings 
""
hello uh sorry this is no  several words  
 
""
so we need add in not applicable to uh let  ' s list one more then
""
in the in the chinese version but also in the english version to
a number of items right so  uhm eight six john 
 
""
yeah 
 
""
okay eighty six not applicable should it add in there
""
uhm eighty eight is okay the sense 
 
""
sure 
 
""
eighty nine okay a sense
""
ninety okay the sense
""
uh okay alright 
""
""
on question ninety
 
""
uhm 
""
""
uh don't know   this  option is not available on
the chinese version
 
""
 uhm  
""
okay then  then what is   that  
""
""
 we have   to add add it in the chinese version
    and  and then on ninety one it is available on the
chinese version but not on the english   version 
 
""
 uhm   
 
""
 it   should be on 
""
""
  okay  add in
 
""
 right  
""
uhm 
""
""
uhm question ninety two the translation between these two
question i have a query
""
uhm the chinese version is translated as uhm do you think people
will accept    the  next chief executive spoke only  
putonghua 
""
so i think it  ' s a bit difference to the one asking english 
 version 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
what do we want to  what we want   to  
 
""
  prefer   to  chinese 
 
""
okay
""
so we want to say it
""
in english we want to say something like  do you think  it
would be acceptable to hong kong people yeah if  the chief executive next
chief executive spoke only putonghua
""
yeah okay alright 
""
""
that  ' s what i have read through so far
""
  i haven't  gone through to the last question yet
 
""
 uhm  
""
well do you want to have them do you want should we or you want
to got   uh so  
""
""
 just a   few to go
 
""
few to go yeah 
 
""
liam what about uhm  the one about  several words
""
""
is that the right number for the correct part
""
it  ' s eighty one  a long pause  
""
""
uh you got your heads your question
 
""
do you think do we need changing the from mobile phone
""
is the same number for direct enquiry 
""
""
uhm i can't  cat  catch your   question 
 
""
 well   the the numbers we put in there one o eight
one one o one and one o eight three   are  the direct  enqu
 enquiry numbers for fixed one term    
""
is the same number for mobile phone 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uh ha  
""
sure
 
""
it is 
""
""
yes
 
""
well i don't think it is
""
i try i i it doesn't work if i call one o eight one on my mobile
phone 
 
""
   two words   
""
""
 you sure  
 
""
no no i don't think so
""
it doesn't work because it  ' s not pccw 
""
""
i have no idea about it  a long pause 
 
""
yeah it does work 
""
it does work i used myself
""
so it does work actually yeah
""
okay does work anyway
""
  it does work okay  that  ' s fine
""
have you uhm have you  liam
""
uh liam have you work in survey before work in survey before 
 
""
 so it doesn't matter   
""
""
actually not
 
""
no 
""
""
no
 
""
uh right
""
so what will be your what will you what will uh your role liam in
conducting the survey
""
you will be looking after the team of people who are   
 uh calling  one word  users 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uhm originally doctor bacon-shone uh want me to be the supervisor
of the whole survey   from  the fixed line component and the
mobile component   but  now uhm as i say that i  ' m going to only
part of it responsible for part of it
 
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
yes well just before we came down if you remember we were having
  conversation  and i thought that it might be more reasonable if
you just to handle the mobile phone and 
""
""
 uh ha  
""
because uh we will make we will make met a number of changes in
the mobile component     perhaps not connecting the fulling
questionnaire   because  it is a bit long   for 
for the mobile uh component
""
  so  there maybe uh much more work as suspected in
the mobile component    
""
but i will be fully responsible for the mobile component  
  and if you want uhm  also the fixed line  com  component
 one word 
 
""
 right  
""
 right  
""
 yes  
""
 right  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
right right 
 
""
but i think the it the
""
in order to make sure this  ' s consistent with our normal practise
    i i think it  ' ll be best you have somebody else to to work
with at least  two words  uh 
""
""
 uhm  
""
because i also want the fixed line component so that conducted as
normal as possible   and  and the usual way in the centre
 
""
 sure  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
so uhm it will be helpful if one experienced supervisor uhm
working with me
 
""
yeah   i  think we can be the observers of that
component    and  then it maybe the  one word
 is possible in the mobile component 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 okay  
""
uhm
 
""
so what question what question do you think maybe drop then from
the  mobile component
""
have you you discuss this with doctor bacon-shone yet
""
no 
""
""
just discuss it
 
""
just discuss   it yeah  
""
""
 we shall   uh
 
""
right uhm 
""
""
but uhm  uhm we have not yet decided which question to
drop and which question to be remained here but we  ' ll probably add some
questions
 
""
okay we will come back to that in the moment perhaps
""
did you have a chance to finish checking   the
questionnaire  
""
""
 yes   just one point
""
question number number ninety seven
""
  upper  class
""
how are we going to translate upper class
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
we  ' ve no idea
 
""
   two words  
""
   several words   
 
""
 rich   
""
""
  several words   
 
""
how would you how would you translate uh
""
is it uh is it difficulty in translating this this term into uh
into the chinese uh did you
""
uh you are social sciences students uh   liam  yeah
""
""
""
 yes  
""
uh ha
 
""
did they give you a lecture on
""
have you attended lectures on social class in hong kong 
""
""
no but  i read from newspaper that  upper class is
called  seuhng lauh seh wuih   these cantonese words refer
to upper class 
""
""
 seuhng lauh seh wuih   these cantonese
words refer to upper class 
""
""
 seuhng lauh   the meaning of these
cantonese words is upper  is it
""
""
very rich people
""
those are go to ballrooms   grand  hyatt
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
""
uhm
""
oh so we just i  ' m i  ' m sure in within you know within the social
sciences faculty in sociology department you have   people  that
you have people using chinese terms uh for this uh for   this term 
""
""
""
 should be a term  
 
""
 i mean  i know we  ' ll work it out    
""
it it n c so is hong kong u alumni he  ' s now in chinese u
""
stephen chu
""
did you did you have him as the lecturer
""
he  ' s the uh he  ' s the uh a demonstrator in sociology department
okay
""
but he  ' s written on social class in hong kong but as i say my
conclusion is uh there isn't a firm base term in hong kong but if you want
translation we can certainly check with him or    one word
  
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 i know   there  ' s research in sociology department
like thomas kwok is it and then   about thomas  wong yeah he
publish   counted  books on this and the articles
""
we can just see what  ' s the standard terms are   
""
""
i  ' m sure there are social i  ' m sure there are sort of  
 chinese   
 
""
 thomas wong  
""
 yeah   
""
""
 okay  
 
""
 i  ' m sure   there are standard translation whether
the general public will understand it or    it  not  
 
""
 do we   want to ask do we want to ask the standard
translation general public i mean yeah 
 
""
well it  ' s sort of depend how you want to use this question 
 
""
uhm 
 
""
i think it  ' s problematic if you need in a way if people don't
understand 
""
""
uhm
 
""
so you you don't think it is
""
so which of these do you think there are people generally
understand  working   class  
""
""
 working   class uhm low middle class and upper
middle   class it mean 
 
""
 what about   just middle class 
""
""
middle class if you say  jung chaan   these
cantonese words refer to middle class  everyone knows   but 
it  ' s difficult to differentiate the line between upper  cla  upper
middle class and lower   middle class 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 why do   why do we  one word 
into three 
 
""
can you say people who are above middle class to be the upper
class 
 
""
upper class    several words   
""
""
 well what do you mean middle uh upper class  
first of all
""
""
  yeah 
 
""
 okay   anyway  uhm 
""
i when why decide number four
""
can you remember why   we  dec   
""
""
  you were   the four  that decided
 
""
we decided it last time   yeah  
""
""
 right   uhm of course you know we did the chinese
translation uhm working class translate like blue collar and white collar and
then like  two words  you know then but stuck upper class
 
""
so blue collar white collar are  several words
 
 
""
why don't we why don't we couldn't we just uhm 
""
blue collar white collar open as as well has been working grow up
in the lower working class so i tell you get the job
""
and the the upper class so   the  
 
""
 that   maybe happen i think so 
 
""
oh there  ' s no hoping that there  ' s no hoping scheme or not they
smokers yeah
""
okay uhm now  the reason the i am the one who want this
because
""
alright a i realize that notion of class membership are very
fluent in hong kong but b there isn't debate growing on up there on the world
that you know english is only acquired by so called upper class people not
you know other not lower social groups right
""
because it is not apparently not the case in hong kong but anyway
uhm 
 
""
well there is another way of looking at it which is if i am send
 one word  to you most places that primary predicted
social class whatever that maybe   are 
""
cause it mother education and parent father occupation  
 
""
so the other way given old  wa  being in discussion right
about where did your   parents from 
""
and alike the question is what do we want to tap into something
like that
""
did we did we got where you want right
""
we got the answer for her 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
no i i just want what i would like to like to like to
""
but people in hong kong would they would know what what would the
term that you  ' ve used for working for  in in in cantonese
""
well how do you translate it 
""
""
well  laahm lihng   these cantonese words
refer to blue collar  is actually good
""
  people  will understand but i just doubt if people
will be able to differentiate between lower middle class and upper middle
  class 
 
""
 yeah  
""
 well   well let  ' s just  one word
 into three social class base
""
working class middle class upper class
""
problem solved   okay  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 laahm lihng   these cantonese words refer to
blue collar  and  jung chaan   these cantonese words
refer to middle class    i will  say
""
  delete the  second one   mark and write on
""
 
""
 yeah  
""
 alright fine  
""
 or we can check   and see what they
""
we can check to see the classification they use in  
sociology  department just for an interest okay
""
let  ' s check on that   okay  fine
""
okay and then a hundred and  uh sorry uh do we want
""
the other question then michelle   uhm  
""
do we want to be do we want to call back late ninety nine onwards
so this was on the previous 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yes  
 
""
no it was the previous one   right  
 
""
 yeah   but  one word  ninety nine
  onward  
 
""
 i   don't think we can do anything with this  
time  
 
""
 right   and ninety eight onwards yup   
""
""
okay
""
we just   need  a statement thank you   very
 much you did great help to our survey
""
we   just  need a thank you note pad and then we
will delete the rest of those questions 
""
okay uh okay well done uh michelle you obviously get tired dear
""
  so  how we go to how are we going to uh how are we
going to correct the the   questionnaire uh  
""
""
 okay  
 
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah   
""
""
 thank you  
""
 i  ' m going   to go through it once more to 
 double  check on uhm some terms like mandarin and putonghua
""
i   notice  a few   some  of them but i
i think i probably would have miss some   as well 
""
so i  ' m going to double check  and then i  ' m going to do the
 the   correction  uh together with wilma
""
  we  ' re going  to go through the form together and
double check the translation and if if i need i may ask susanna to help as
well   so  and i  ' m going to check about the terms   of
the  the   the  upper class bla bla bla
""
and then we will make a more decent copy   of  
of the whole questionnaire and then we can call zoe uh probably next week or
the week   after  next i don't know maybe  by the end of
next week   i can  check with zoe and see when is she
available to come up and amend   the  questionnaire the 
 chinese  and the english   version
""
so  uhm afterwards we i think i better check it once more
  after  zoe has amended   the two forms the two
 questionnaires and then i double check it   again  so
to make sure that everything go right   and then  afterwards
i guess maybe you can give the send the copy to doctor   bacon
 - shone and then it should be   done  by the time

 you you   can email me the soft copy and then
we can uh arrange the part 
""
""
yeah
 
""
and then what  ' s i  ' m thinking is uh that may take a long time if
you got to what we have to check and see how  ' s zoe pace
""
  but  i think we should get it done before we can
""
  i just i have another   al  alternative
  and  that is we can ask uh because we got a problem with
chinese words we can ask golly to do it   i talk yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 if zoe saw  
""
 yes  
""
 yes that  ' s what i  ' m thinking too  
""
if zoe is not available then i just have to make it very clear and
then show it to   golly or  crystal and then after they do the
uhm   amendment 
 
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 crystal   hasn't crystal hasn't got any chinese
word 
""
""
no she know how   to type 
 
""
 she she   use to have chinese word before
""
oh she know uh that   she know
""
okay maybe she  can do it
""
so crystal best solution crystal can do it on the computer in
room one hundred 
""
""
 she know how to type  
""
yeah yeah whatever and then   after  they do the
amendment then i will check it again    
""
and then if things are alright we can send a copy to doctor
bacon-shone
 
""
 yeah  
""
 right  
""
so when are we now
""
today is wednesday 
""
""
today is thursday
 
""

""
""
