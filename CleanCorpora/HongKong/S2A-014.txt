tough to reverse those placings but 
he does have reasonable form around here at happy valley and with
the stable having a win in the previous probably should be kept a little
safer 
perhaps those horses starting to may be those horses ready to
show something 
indy ' s gem been a disappointment this season and uh i think he was
handicapped pretty pretty well to sort of pick up a race but uh haven't
really appeared to be too many excuses for him 
uh he ' s a he ' s a big price twenty to one the market doesn't
suggest that uh a there ' s much improvement in him and i don't really i
couldn't have him on this season ' s form i could last though so i really
don't know what to make of him 
yep i would uh fully agree with you there on last season ' s
form he ' d have a great chance but he looks as though he ' s had easy enough
opportunities to me already this season 
ah he ' s getting a bit warm in the paddock here tonight he does lack
a little bit of sparkle he doesn't look like a horse who ' s really in the
absolute top of form at the moment 
his form hasn't appeared to be on this track either so i ' m quite
happy to stay wide clear of him now 
he ' s been fancied at all three runs this term 
douglas white shane dye and eric legrix have all had chances to try
and uh get a win out of him 
i don't see how uh wai leung ' s going to be able to do that tonight
from barrier ten 
couldn't have him at the moment indy ' s gem he ' s been a big
disappointment 
here ' s millennium legend coming back to the sixteen fifty metres
the eighteen hundred metres he failed to stay it out last week behind jade
rui 
had his try though he had a soft lead 
quick step gave him about four lengths in the run and beat him a
half on the wire 
he ' s drawn to go forward in gate seven 
yeah ah not as taken by him as i was earlier on in the season
when uh i thought he actually looked very good indeed 
ah i just wonder whether that stretching of his stamina last time
is going to leave a mark or not 
he certainly doesn't look to be quite as well as he did he ' s
certainly not losing weight like he was last season but uh he has looked
better than this already this season 
he ' s he ' s pretty consistent over the valley mile uh i mean
he ' s hard to hard to ignore i think he ' ll be he ' ll be there or thereabouts
he should get a reasonable run from where he ' s drawn 
doesn't win too often but uh doesn't finish out of the frame too
often either so 
hard to hard to leave out millennium legend next one along who i
think will take a lot of beating but uh he ' s probably under the odds in the
betting he ' s uh slightly better than six to four or twenty six fifty 
good record last time where the pace was very strong he he won
first up of course uh with uh tony cruz up this season 
i just think he ' s a slightly improved horse this this term and i
think he ' ll take a lot of beating from a favourable draw 
don't see why he shouldn't ah in actual fact clint this horse
country dragon as you say had a very tough run last time 
uh felix coetzer wasn't aboard either and uh i think he ' s uh
likely to get on with him uh all the much better he ' s the one that ' s been
uh riding him out in work in the mornings ah he ' s likely to be putting him
in the right position 
he looks pretty well drawn in three even if he doesn't need to get
the soft run into the race and he looks very well 
ah i ' m more than happy the way country dragon has come into the
paddock here tonight 
he was very impressive when he won first up for tony cruz this
season and uh 
like you mark i don't think he necessarily has to lead if he took
the sit behind millennium legend or something lese that might want to spear
forward 
he ' d be in an ideal position here tonight he did do much work last
time and really battled on well de integro 
he might get a nice uh soft smother up on the rails enough to
ensure he runs a place uh from gate number one 
last time out he finished a close fourth to millennium spirit over
the slightly longer journey 
looks in great order i must say de integro big strong powerful
quarters on him 
he can get a bit warm on some occasions he looks pretty settled
here tonight 
i ' m happy very happy the way he ' s come into the paddock as well
he ' s drawn very well in one another horse who could get a very good run into
the race 
he always carry ' s a bit of condition on him uhm i like him here
tonight he looks in good good order 
he uh certainly does and peter chapel hyam ' s got him holding
his form very well and 
uh as you mentioned already he ' s going to get a good run and
certainly could make the frame and uh he ' s a little bit of value so he ' s
one to uh keep safe 
john egan on board 
next one i think we ' re going back up to the top half with cullinan
i just thought he ' d be a little bit of a risk over the trip uhm i thought
his work and everything had been pretty good leading up to this particular
outing but 
the real question mark for me mark was uh after that last run up in
distance i i had big queries over him about seeing out the trip particularly
from a wide gate 
ah yes i wouldn't disagree with that either 
he ' s a horse who ' s got his fair amount of temperament too he can
fire up and be very temperamental in the parade ring 
it ' s actually been pretty good for him here tonight ah i ' ve seen
him an awful lot worse than he ' s been doing in here 
so interesting 
eric legrix on board of course ah successful from our last whether
he can make it a quick double remains to be seen 
the market would suggest otherwise two hundred and seventy dollars
ah i just think he looks well enough in himself but not the race that i think
is ideal for him as it stands 
so i ' m certainly not drawing a negative from the paddock over him
he ' s actually behaved himself better tonight 
okay showed no interest in the race whatsoever last time all
the head gear comes off him 
just in time 
ah he loomed up as the winner momentarily here at his first go over
the sixteen fifty but romantic venture was the horse that really benefited
from the fast pace and came right over the top 
but this horse would certainly have to rate a chance on form this
season 
looks in good order too just in time looks to be holding his
form far better than he has done in the past 
looks to be holding his condition far better than he has done in
the past as well 
so there ' s ah a couple of positives to say the least that ah this
horse just in time 
uhm wouldn't be at all surprised to see him go close now
yip based on that last run would have to be one for the short
list here 
but can't really say anything positive about seattle sun ah his
form this season has been pretty woeful really 
this was his has been it was his track last season certainly he
notched a couple of wins here over the valley mile and 
he ' s capable on his day but not based on what we ' ve seen this
year mark 
i tell you one thing clint this horse hasn't looked like this
all season this is uh a a massive turnaround in what he ' s looked like in in
the paddock 
he ' s continued to sweat and not look well in himself i think he
actually looks a million dollars here tonight ah and this one has caught me
out big time ah 
the last time he did this he actually ran a big race 
i would now want to keep him safe he ' s going out at huge odds but
i think this is the best i ' ve seen him look in a long long while seattle sun
okay this is his first run in almost four weeks seattle sun so
the works been poured into him 
on his best form he would rate so uh perhaps he worth a
reassessment 
the way the results have been going here tonight 
ha ha ha
look for those with the bad form and you ' re half way there
golden king in the gold flask colours wonder if they will rub off a
bit 
he lead up in the land lord trial and ran third 
ha ha ha
clearly beaten in both race starts this season 
that infamous trial darren 
yeah yes let ' s just call it that trial 
seattle sun is actually getting very wound up now as he makes
his way out on the course 
just starting to ah get a little bit of a sweat on but he looks
like a horse who ' s on the job here tonight 
ah not overly taken by golden king certainly doesn't seem to have
an adverse effect with the blinkers on though he ' s not been fired up at all
uhm but he fails to take my eye i still think he looks like a bit of a green
baby to me and i think he ' s going to need a bit of time
yip looks the way the next one ' s an interesting runner profit
treasure has the blinkers applied ah tonight for the first time i believe and
ah his last run was actually quite encouraging mark uhm definitely one that i ' d
be keeping safe he ' s ah around ah nine to point or one hundred and six fifty
in the betting what did you make of him 
ah i thought he looked still to be a bit on the light side i i
just think he may have flattered last time me and you was the horse that won
that race i don't think it was a particularly strong contest 
he looks very well in himself but there ' s not a great deal of him
uh for me i still think he needs to strengthen up a fraction yet quarters
look good though so it ' s just he ' s lacking a bit of depth behind the saddle
ah i ' d say he ' s not far off from being absolutely right 
i wonder if they ' ll go forward again on this ah glory st
pauls he just keeps knocking up 
is there any choice ah i think is the question because he does
look to pull very keenly indeed simon yim ' s the man on board who ' s got the
unenviable task i feel in some respects with glory st pauls because we
haven't seen him finish off a race strongly yet and 
ah all we ' ve seen him do is pull and be very keen through the
early stages 
uhm not for me he ' s got very warm indeed here tonight hot and uh
not taking the eye 
winning delights was well found in the betting last time mark
did run an improved race without threatening and uh comes in
well in the weights here is improving all the time but ah probably not just
yet for my uh based what i thought on the form but heading in the right
direction 
he just looks to me as though he fails to hit the line
strongly he gets himself into a position where you you think he should run
well and then the response looks to be a bit disappointing to me he appears
to hit a flat spot and not really come through with it
