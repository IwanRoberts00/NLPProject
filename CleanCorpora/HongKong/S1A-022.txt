""
""
yes  then you ask me question
 
""
okay 
""
uhm  can you tell me what you have done today
""
  anything anything   s  anything special happened
today 
""
""
 it  ' s so simple    laugh 
""
uhm  today i  ' ve been  to the flora ho centre   
 hoping to attend the fitness training course
""
but unfortunately the class is cancelled due to the change of the
timetable     so i and florence just  uhm  went to
play table tennis  for about half an hour    
""
and we  uhm  went to running
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 oh okay  
""
jogging 
""
""
jogging
 
""
how long did you jog 
""
""
three circles
 
""
how long is that how long did you take 
""
""
about uh three minutes
 
""
oh okay
""
round the tennis court 
""
""
yes  but the environment wasn't very good
 
""
for jogging 
""
""
yes because there is a construction site  uhm in the road
and the environment was very noisy
 
""
uhm oh construction
""
what construction 
""
""
uhm i don't   know 
 
""
 what are   they trying to construct 
""
""
uhm  the road was dug up 
""
i don't know whether they would  put some pipes under the road
or not
 
""
uhm    two words   
""
""
 or the   the roads in hong kong  are always dug
up and then uhm     and then do something and then recovered
    to the normal stage
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
oh okay  but though  you didn't know exactly what they are
doing   
""
are they  trying to  construct the underground tunnel 
""
""
 i don't know  
""
no  no
 
""
not the overseas tunnel 
""
""
it  ' s too expensive to construct the old the the  tunnel
under the road
 
""
uhm  but there  ' s a new one coming up isn't it 
""
""
which one
 
""
there is a third  oversea tunnel 
""
""
third   oversea 
 
""
 to   connect hong kong island and kowloon 
""
""
really
""
  i never heard of that 
 
""
 yes i was told  
""
i was told  by uh one of the senior lecturer  that they are
constructing another tunnel   on  the western side of  hong
kong island    to kowloon 
""
yes 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 to kowloon  
""
really
 
""
uhm that  ' s what i was told
""
the  phase  should complete  maybe in nineteen ninety
seven or ninety eight 
""
""
i don't think so because uhm hong kong government  
  may not spend uhm  so large amount of money   
building another  kind  of tunnel 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 oh i see 
""
then there  ' s   something for us to find out  whether
that  ' s true or not true 
""
""
it  ' s not my business
 
""
why is that  both laugh 
""
you are a hong konger how can you say it  ' s not your business 
""
 well  it  ' s something to find out whether that  ' s true or
not true 
""
""
but this kind of social policy  does not affect my life 
so i   would not spend time   to find out the answer
 
""
 uh oh no  
""
very selfish uh but it affects traffic flow
""
it affects uhm  daily life of people who lives around  hong
kong and they have to work in kowloon and people who is to work in kowloon or
they when they stay in hong kong or or or the other way round 
""
""
i live in   new territories 
 
""
 so it so it   it helps to relieve the traffic
congestion
""
 aiya  that  ' s not very  thoughtful then just
thinking of yourself 
""
""
no
""
  but i pay attention 
 
""
 and it also affects   the country  ' s economy when
there  ' s   not some traffic  jam okay  laugh  
""
""
  laugh   
""
no
 
""
okay  laugh 
""
so you want you   want  to say 
""
""
 let  ' s  
""
let  ' s check it  tape cut off and restarted 
""
""
asher
 
""
yes 
""
""
have you paid attention  to the  current issues between
 taiwan and china
 
""
i thought i am suppose to ask you the question and not you asking
me the question   but  anyway  laugh  
""
""
 no   we  ' re just talking  laugh 
 
""
anyway uh  follow-ups  fol  follow some news  
and   of course not very very closely     knowing
that there was an election going on and it  ' s already over 
""
  and so  what do you think about the the situation
then 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
  laugh   
""
okay do you know uhm  who has  won the election   
you know 
""
it  ' s lee teng hui
 
""
 yes of course  
""
yes 
""
""
and i think this  uhm result is quite unexpected
 
""
oh i thought it  ' s expected 
""
""
why
""
because if i were a taiwanese     i would be very
afraid of the  missiles     sent off by the  chinese
government     and i would choose to vote another candidate
who would advocate the uhm  who would not advocate the independence of
taiwan     so as to  keep uhm  china   
happy  
""
so uhm i don't think uhm lee teng hui would win the election
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  uhm  
""
oh i was thinking of the other way round    
""
it  ' s because of the  the threatening    
exercises that the chinese government had   that  actually 
unite the chinese together
""
  chinese of taiwan  i mean
""
the chinese in taiwan   
""
 two-words   people get together when
they are threatened to show the chinese government of china that  we will
be together no matter what happen so they tend to support lee teng hui
instead of  the other leaders who doesn't  encourage   
 the independence of taiwan 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 unite the chinese  
""
 uhm
""
that means  
""
 uhm  
""
but uhm 
""
i  i don't think it is wise for the chinese government 
   to launch the military exercise     to
threaten taiwan    
""
because  as you have said that  it would have uhm 
counter-effect to unite  th  the taiwanese    
""
and  also it would let the international uh
""
it would it would let the other countries to know  that china
 is quite barbaric     in using the military force to 
spread its political message     to taiwan for not uhm
gaining independence     and also uhm by launching such
large-scale military exercise china  have spent  up    about
""
""
uhm say how many 
""
two billion 
""
it  ' s quite large amount of money     at and if
that china would use this kind of money to improve the  social condition
    in china
""
it  ' ll quite uhm 
""
it  ' ll quite a blessing   to  the chinese
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 lots of money  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm </[10  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
""
but the chinese government has to show taiwan that  they do
not agree with the independence of that state     so they
have to do something about it   probably  a military exercise
would be one of the way to show taiwan that we have the power to to take
control of everything 
""
however it has some  counter-effect of what they want uh 
  uhm  
""
 such as  
""
yes uhm but i think uhm some peaceful  uhm  conference 
   between two countries would be more helpful rather than the 
military  exercise
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm well that is a good suggestion but not everybody is willing
to sit down and talk over the table 
""
""
or maybe after this kind of uhm threatening    
the leaders between two countries would willing to sit together to talk
 
""
 uhm  
""
maybe and we hope so 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
i think uh this kind of  milit  this kind of war games
would have some implications about uh    future  of hong kong
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm  uhm
""
true true but i don't think there will be  great  effect
 on hong kong
""
hong kong will still go on as usual 
""
""
no 
""
i think it  ' s of political significance     on the
 future of hong kong because uhm as taiwan is trying to gain the political
autonomy     through uhm elections    
""
and  it means that if hong kong after nineteen ninety-seven
    would try to gain  more autonomy
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm
""
they might do the same thing 
""
""
uhm they might do the same thing or they would use other kind
of channels to threaten hong kong     so that it would uhm
greatly affect the  uh the autonomy   of  hong kong and  i
 am quite  afraid of the  of the  of the  of the
""
what
""
i am quite afraid of the  hong  the future of hong kong as
i don't think uhm  one country two systems is possible
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
""
well time will tell whether it is possible 
""
but i doubt china will do the same thing to  hong kong or even
to have some  uhm 
""
or they will they will they will not show  they will not show
if hong kong is trying to  to gain some independence   what  
wha wha wha  taiwan is trying to do i doubt  chin  china will do
any or chinese the chinese government will do anything to  hong kong
because they are both interdependent and they they benefits from each other
mutually 
""
""
 uhm  
""
no how about the current issues happened in hong kong
""
the building of the airport and the   development  of
the representative government   that  uh chinas would  want
have a a say     in these    uhm  local
issues
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
""
i think they should because there are still somehow like uh a
headquarter of a branch    so  you cannot
""
it  ' s just like uh any organization
""
  china  being the  the headquarter   and
hong kong   after 1997 is just a branch of  the organization so
the headquarter  now or in future the chinese government should have some
say in  the local government here 
""
""
 pardon  
""
 uhm  
""
 headquarter  
""
but under the sino-british agreement     it is
agreed uhm by the china and the british british  side that uhm higher
autonomy will be given to hong kong    
""
but why should the headquarter  always try to intervene  the
policy of hong kong    
""
just let the chinese  oh no just let the hong kong elite to
rule hong kong    
""
it  ' s quite possible way
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
they have actually promised to let them have total autonomy over
it 
""
""
but it  ' s just a promise     not a truth
 
""
 uhm  
""
yeah and anybody can break the promise 
""
""
yes  especially  the chinese   government 
 laugh 
""
  i am quite pessimistic 
 
""
 oops  
""
  be careful  of  
""
 be careful  of what you say after nineteen ninety-seven
uh 
""
""
i  ' ll move to singapore  laugh 
 
""
oh  laugh  no problem
""
you are welcome any time 
""
""
really  laugh 
 
""
yes
""
a break   tape cut off and restarted 
 
""
okay what do you think you have learned over this uh three years
   almost  three years 
""
""
 i learnt a lot  
""
i learnt a lot
 
""
uh now that you are university education
""
okay what are the a lot since you have a lot so there must be a
lot to say 
""
""
 laugh 
""
uhm  first of all  i feel that i am growing up  during
the  university life
 
""
growing up in what sense
""
physically  both laughed 
""
everybody is growing up 
""
""
no  laugh  
""
uhm  uhm how to say
""
it  ' s quite difficult  to say  in a few words
 
""
okay 
""
""
and first of all uhm  i have led an independent  life
in the university as i have moved away from my family     to
the mini-hall   and also  to  to the swire hall   
""
""
and  it is so happy to live without my family members  
 
""
and because i can  do whatever i like
""
i can sleep late and i can  uhm go to whenever  places that
i like    
""
and also uhm i have a taste of freedom     during
these three years  '  university life    
""
uhm  i can  meet different kind of people   
 that would give me  some insights 
""
because uhm  when i was  a  year one student  
  i was quite immature     in thinking my way of
life in thinking  how to deal with people in thinking uhm how to  uhm
how to lead my university life
""
i just  like a small potato being put in a  in a  in a
very complex and quite difficult world    
""
i don't know my way 
""
so somebody  so during the visit  in the swire hall somebody
advise me to  think clearly what i want to do   in  my
university life 
""
at that time i  gave him no answer     as i
 never thought of how to live my life because in my secondary years 
what i had to do is just to  uhm pass the examination to gain high marks
in the test and to  uhm  to  to do my  homework   
""
""
this life in my university is very  sim  in my in my
secondary school is very simple
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 oh oh okay  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
don't you have the ambition when  when  you are a small 
girl 
""
""
uhm my ambition is only to enter university
 
""
that  ' s all 
""
""
yes that  ' s it   
""
it  ' s so simple 
 
""
oh  not very   ambitious uh
""
okay 
""
""
no
""
uhm in my  primary  school     i thought of
entering  uhm  my secondary school   which  is  the
band one    school   in  yuen long or in new
territories    
""
and i tried very hard   doing my 
""
uhm uhm
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 secondary school  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 5 and you manage to  
""
and you manage to 
""
""
  good luck  laugh  
 
""
  three words    okay 
""
""
 ye  yes     and i entered  my
secondary school i found all my  classmates  uhm were hard-working and
diligent     and i  lagged behind  especially  in
the subject of uh mathematics and english     so i tried very
hard in order uhm  to have a flying colours   in  
one-word  in examination    
""
and after uhm i finished my secondary  schools  i just
gained nothing but a certificate    and  i know  nothing
when i entered university    
""
i  ' m so immature at that time
""
so uhm  in my  secondary 
""
no no in my university life  i started to  thought of uhm
to think of what is  life    
""
and i tried to develop uhm  the interpersonal skills  
 
""
and i  tried  to uhm  concern other people  ' s needs
    so i do social  services    
""
and i
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
so so what do you learn  from the social service uh 
""
""
uhm to love people     especially the needed
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm the unfortunate ones 
""
""
yes     and i  learnt uhm  to be patient
with  people
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
""
have you  ever asked yourself when was the first time you 
you  wonder about life you know
""
when is the very first time you wonder about life you wonder
about  death you wonder about
""
why do people come to this world and   they  ' ll  just
disappear at the old age or even  before old age 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
 
""
have you ever asked your mother when you were a small girl 
""
  why  do people die uhm 
""
""
 no   
""
i don't have  a very uhm  a very  uhm
 
""
as usual at that time parents uh  do not explain many things
""
they would just say don't ask you will understand when you grow
up 
""
""
no i never thought of life death  when i was  young
 
""
uhm 
""
""
i thought of it uhm  when i  have a  touch with the
religion
 
""
oh okay 
""
""
at that time i was  uhm in secondary  six
 
""
uhm 
""
i remember when i was a small boy i can't remember exactly how
old i was     but  somewhere during the primary school
education     i start to wonder about death you know
""
where do people go after they die    where  
at that age you become so scary that i had nightmares occasionally but not
very   often
""
and  i and i can be and i i remember i  i woke up in the
middle of the night     crying and  and you know
""
just very frightened about death and wondering  where are all
those people after they die    
""
and  however i never get an answer
""
and after when i  become older  and the question just never
come to me probably i am too busy with other things    
""
but i could remember i started asking myself when i was in
primary school  and of course parents at that time never give you an
answer   you know  
""
or maybe i never ask i just had the question  deep inside in
me but i never ask uhm 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
  laugh 
""
yes  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
 
""
yeah i think it  ' s a very scary question 
""
""
yes it  ' s scary and  i do believe that even my parents
can't give me an answer     because they are not uhm 
""
they do not believe in  any religion
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
""
yeah  i guess so 
""
""
it may be also a frightening question to them
 
""
yes 
""
""
when my father  uhm is older  and older   and
 he  ' s nearly uhm fifty-four    
""
and i think uhm  uhm  the old man would  have a problem
in facing  death
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
yeah probably 
""
""
uhm
 
""
uhm 
""
""
so i really want to introduce religion to him
""
uhm but i never start  and i never started to pray
 
""
 two-words  
""
so you have to  i know it  ' s difficult but  have to give it
a try 
""
sometimes i do ask myself but i never try to do so 
""
""
uhm 
""
because i think that uhm men would be quite uhm  stubborn in
believing a daughter  ' s saying     as  the  the man the
chinese man would need people to respect him     but not 
to introduce a new concept to him
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm  true 
""
yeah so hopefully god will touch him one day  one way or
another 
""
""
uhm  yes so i should start uhm praying
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
sometimes i find that uhm uhm  life is so complex we have
to face our own life
 
""
our own problems 
""
""
yes to face our own problems and we have to take care the
others and to think of uhm how meaningful would the other uhm lead their life
believe in god especially they are  my family members   a pause
""
 
""
true 
""
""
uhm     so we have to face the spiritual
problems  and also the daily life problems    
""
but sometimes  the daily life problems would uhm  overwhelm
 the spiritual problems    
""
do you get my meaning
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
yes of   course  
""
""
 because   we are too busy with our own work
 
""
yes worrying about the test the assignments     the
exams 
""
""
 yes  
""
and we seldom spare a thought  to god  to our spiritual life
""
""
and we would be uhm very busy  in going around and around
meeting  people and develop  tape ends 
 
""
 hoi chi  
""
""
okay  uhm let  ' s go back to university life
 
""
yeah   yeah  okay
""
you are saying about developing interpersonal skills 
""
""
 okay  
""
yes
 
""
uhm learning to be more independent 
""
""
yes
 
""
  and  
""
""
 and  
""
when i  when i first come to this university i just found it
is very  tantalizing     because  i uhm met many
different people     and they are very talkative 
""
uhm  uhm at the first sight i don't know how to talk with
people    
""
i don't know  how to contact with different kind of people
    who would have different kinds of personalities
""
and it  ' s so difficult for me to find a suitable  comm  uh
topic to discuss  so i feel very frustrated
""
at the first  beginning people would say that i was  shy
    and  i was quiet 
""
and  true i think that it is part of my personalities but uhm
 because the environment is totally different from my secondary school 
so  i will be quite scared to express myself     and to
 uhm  talk with different kind of people i don't  know before 
  
""
so  i tried really very hard to open my mouth  and to 
laugh  and to talk with people
""
and fortunately uhm  uhm  i feel i was quite  successful
 in  in  in developing a good interpersonal skills
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
so how did you overcome that problem then 
""
""
uhm    two-words  
 
""
 you are saying   that it  ' s very difficult to start a
conversation so how do you overcome that problem 
""
""
uhm it needs time to practise so i would try bit by bit to
talk with uhm different kind of people     and  and 
and i would uhm remember  uhm their problems     or 
their experience and then when next time i see them i would try to uhm 
uhm  say
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
ask them how are they getting on 
""
""
yes so we
 
""
do you do you remember them deliberately you know  just 
""
""
yes at the very  beginning i remembered  the hallmates  '
life and experience
 
""
uhm but do you  go and remember each individual  ' s problem
deliberately  you know 
""
just on purpose   so that you  can start a conversation
later 
""
""
 on purpose  
""
yes at the very  first beginning    i  did so
because
 
""
 oh no  
""
i think that is very stressful okay 
""
""
no because you know that in   my  secondary  ' s
 life i don't know how to contact to with people
""
i just uhm would bury my head into the books    
and study and study and study and it  ' s  it  ' s really very difficult 
""
and i will try my very best to say hello to each one   
 to say good morning  so as to  uhm  to look like friendly 
   but truly i i i am friendly
""
i don't  di  pretend it   to be friendly 
""
so uhm i  ' ll uhm take the initiative to enter the other floormates  '
room  to have a chat 
""
and  even though  it looks like uhm  simple daily life to
enter the other one  ' s  li  to to enter the other  one  ' s  ro
 room 
""
it  ' s really a big task for me
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm okay  
""
oh okay 
""
""
so later  i  uhm  i adapted to this kind of
environment and people  so  uhm eventually  i succeed in building up
some kind of close friendships with some friends     and i
tried to participate in other kind of extra-curricular activities such as the
leadership  and life skill course    
""
and at that  place the counselor would give us  good advice
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
about what 
""
""
about uhm  about uhm  how to  express your 
opinion    
""
how to  uhm  how to  work with the other people  and
what is the group dynamic    
""
uhm  uh when we do a project together  so we know  uh in
a meeting how to conduct the  the message  and how to respond 
""
it is a so 
""
it is a very good training
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm  yeah
""
i think you have mentioned  many times that the training was
 excellent 
""
""
uhm   yes 
""
and i started to think  more about life    
since that course  so  in my   s  year two  i  was the
leader of social services group     and it was a great
challenge to me     because i have to be a leader to lead a
team of sixty members    
""
and before that i was quite shy     at swire hall
and suddenly  i was elevated to be a leader
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yes  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
well i think you are very impressive 
""
""
really
 
""
that  ' s how i remember you yes 
""
""
yes
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i  ' ve tried my very best to  express my   opinion
 to  contact  the meeting     and to apply the
theory which i have learned in the leadership   course  into
practice     so i  ' ll be very uhm  say uhm  careful
    about my  personal growth    
""
so i really  uhm seize the chance  to develop myself 
  
""
and after that year i found i was quite successful   
  and i became more confident  and i  become uhm more
open-minded    
""
and it is easier for me to talk with the others   
 because i can contact different kind of staff at different kind of
centres     and also to communicate different kind of
hallmates     so as to  uhm proceed the  social
services 
""
so i really  gained a lot     in year two
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yes  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
yeah so year three 
""
""
year three  laugh  and i moved  to a miniflat 
   and i found my life was  peaceful  and quiet and i do
enjoy that kind of life  cos i can concentrate on my studies  and i can
uhm  put more time in   doin  doing my own  personal business
 
""
 oh yes  
""
uhm   a pause 
""
""
and i have a  good sleep each night     and
 i feel energetic
 
""
 uhm  
""
the following day 
""
""
uhm  so  it  ' s so fulfilling     even
though uhm  i can't  see the other hallmates
 
""
 uhm  
""
oh okay
""
you don't miss them 
""
""
uhm  sometimes yes    and  some close 
f  and  i would contact the other close friends 
""
yes     that  ' s it 
""
but uhm i have a question in my mind that uhm what is maturity
 
""
 uhm uhm    uhm uhm  
""
how 
""
""
yes that  ' s really the problem that i always  uhm thought
of 
 
""
what is maturity 
""
""
yes because  some uhm i know part of the answer  
 
""
maturity is to uhm  is to  say  concern the other people  ' s
needs   and  to uhm  take care of the other one
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
true
""
a mature person not only  able to take care of others but you
must first be able to take care of yourself 
""
""
uhm
 
""
you can't even take care of yourself how can you take care of
others 
""
""
that means we have to know what way we have to go  
 
""
what we have to do
""
how to  handle  our own problems mentally and   let
me say  so physically is it right     because we have to
take care of our    body 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 okay yeah correct   so the basic needs of life 
   food clothings  shelter 
""
""
 yes  
""
and also sports
 
""
uhm uhm 
 so i think i can take care of myself     physically 
very well  laugh  but not mentally sometimes
""
you see i i always can't uhm  handle pressure and stress
 
""
 uhm  
""
uhm 
""
pressure when when the exam is near when there  ' s lots of
assignments 
""
""
yes and also i have to face the another kind of life after my
graduation
 
""
oh don't worry that  ' s part uhm parts of life
""
you definitely meet problems  as you go along 
""
if you don't don't if you if you don't meet any problems you will
not grow    
""
as  you see more problems  when you are able to handle
with them slowly you  ' ll learn  something out of it
""
it  ' s just that sometimes you don't realize that you are learning
something out of it 
""
""
 yes  
""
uhm so when  tha  when we overcome the problem  and we
 turn our head back     we can see oh the problem is over
and i have learned     something and  and i would like to
say that god has  helped me  to overcome the problem
 
""
 uhm  
""
 something  
""
uhm 
""
well if being a being a christian of course you will always 
uh say that yes god has helped   you right 
""
if from a non-christian point of view     they
would say that oh through their personal effort through their personal uh 
ability they are able to solve the problem themselves 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
or would they think that  they have finally  muddled through
the problem
 
""
well  could be another way of  s  seeing it 
""
""
uhm     but it  ' s quite pessimistic  
 to say  so
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
but that it all depends on that  that individual  ' s attitudes
towards life     yeah 
""
some people thinks life is short  be happy  whenever you
can  and  problem is  forever-coming
""
one problem is over another problem will arise  then when you
solve this problem  another problem comes so you got to tackle the new
problem 
""
when this  ne ne  when this new problem becomes an old
problem  then when you solve it another problem comes so it  ' s it  ' s just
the cycle of life 
""
""
 uhm  
""
so that  ' s life full of us unexpected challenges    
problems
 
""
 right
