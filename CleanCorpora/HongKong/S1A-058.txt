uh uh what did what what kind what this specific course now uh
you are taking there 
you mean about this project
 
yeah
about this project 
 oh 
the name of the course is varieties of english
 
oh so that it ' s the varieties of english
ok 
so i have to co you know collect data from
different kind of english

that ' s why 
so how do you find how do you find
uhm how do you find these uh gaining such uh related languages
from the other 
from the other countries
says uh english in the philippines
and english in hong kong
how how do you find how do you distinguish them 
how you classify it 
 yeah 
i will classify it after the record dings
yeah
 
oh
i see 
because i have to analyse the differences
after i you know uhm write down the transcript
 
yeah
 huh and then 
 yeah 
and then i ' ll try to find some differences between the
english
 
mm
i see
ok 
actually
you can ask me questions
uh not so academic
 
mm i see
ok 
 yeah
you can ask me something about the private life al
 also
yeah
 i don't mind 
 
 3-words 
oh really 
yeah
maybe you can ask me of uhm the relationship
uh between my between me and your mom 
yeah
 
 4-words 
yeah
 yeah
yeah
any
any 
 
 oh i see
 noth nothing specific like
 all the topics re regarding the course
 of your studies 
 yeah
yeah 
 yeah
yeah
yeah 
yeah
yeah
 
oh a few words 
 because what we need is a natural
conversation
you know
 not base on anything academic
or you know an anything that is base on the course
yeah
 
 oh
yeah 
oh i see
ok
and then the 
 yeah 
we can both we just relax
and you know have some interesting
conversation
yeah
 
 on any topics you mean 
oh
i see
ok
uh how do you 
uh you are the friends of miss fok for how long for
how long are you 
how long 
uhm since since form five
because uhm because uh when i was s studying uhm uh
 at the level of form five
i have taken uhm a summer job
in the boutique 
and i work in a at a 
 
 oh
i see 
so you 
you you were you meet miss fok in the same boutique
before 
yeah
 
or you are studying in the same school 
 yeah
exactly 
yeah 
we ' re not in the same school
because we ' re at different ages
 
 a-few-words 
oh
i see
so she ' s older than you mean
miss fok is older than you 
 yeah 
yeah
 
oh
i see 
$a laughs 
so that ' s mean you just uh have uh 
you don't think so
 you you you think i look the same
 
 yeah
i don't think so laughter 
you look uh laughter 
uhm ms fok is only twenty eighth i think 
twenty eighth
 
yeah 
yeah
 
and you you 2-words 
are are you really
oh you are s 1-word 
 
 i ' m just twenty two 
 you can't figure out
 just from the face 
 
 yeah laughter 
yeah laughter 
i look so old
 
not not much laughter 
maybe without the makeup
 
yeah
 maybe
maybe 
it must be
so how do you find your friendship with miss fok
is it uh that uh although with uh with your age
differences
but i think now you you can still have a nice uh 
 yeah 
yeah 
mm
 
being together with 
yeah
uhm i think uhm uh have you heard about some people say
that
if you work in different field
you are not working together 
sometime your interests will not clash
 
 yeah 
yeah
yeah
yeah 
yes
yes that ' s right
huh huh 
 and your friendship one word
 uh you can you know can last much longer
 
yeah
yeah 
because you are you know a few words
that ' s why 
 yeah 
 i think maybe
you know 
yeah 
part of the 
it ' s part of the reason
i think
 
oh 
and the other reason is i think is we can talk many different
things
and we are tut i think 
 
 so you mean you are exchanging some ideas
so exchanging your ideas
and miss fok is also giving us some ideas
on such things like this
would they 1-word you about your studies
uhm we we ' re not used to talking about uhm my
studies
usually about her work
 your her working
yeah 
yeah
 
 oh
i see 
so in that means you mean that you got uh some ideas from
her 
yeah
maybe because you know uh her husband
 
yeah
yeah
yeah 
is always in china 
so
you know so uhm she she always have to find someone to talk to
and you know i ' m
 
 in china 
 yeah 
oh
i see
you are the close 
yeah
 
a akin
i mean a kin relationship
you know what it is kin that means that you have 
close
kin
k i n means closer relationship
like with ms fok like that 
 akin 
k i n
 
yeah
kin 
oh
 
uh no
no
no
kin
k e e n
i mean kin 
yeah
means closer one 
 k e n 
k e e n
you mean
 
yeah 
uh
 
closer relationship
 1-word by talking 
very intimate 1-word 
 
yeah
like intimacy
yeah
it ' s another term is keen
yeah
i think keen
k e e n
yeah
right 
uh uh sometimes it ' s quite s you know
interesting because she is older than me but 
it ' s always me who saw who try to solve a problem 
 ins you know instead of you other way around
yeah 
 
 oh 
 laughter 
really
really 
oh
i see
not
it ' s nice
it ' s nice that uh you know
even though you you have an age differences
 but it ' s still
she can gain some ideas from you 
and the way around like 
 yeah
mm 
 mm 
yeah
so now now you you are just start in in the
 1-word english studies
you have you are not having some business like that one 
 or you are tired 
 i am so lazy 
i hav haven't taken any part time job
during my studies
 
really
 so you mean
you just keep on studying without 
oh 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 without money 
i see 
 he ' s my sponsor
 laughter 
he ' s the boss
you mean laughter 
yeah
 
he ' s the big boss 
uh so after you uh maybe you ' ve uh some day
you gonna finish your studies so 
what ' s your what ' s your plan
in your life 
uhm my aspirations since my childhood
is to do uh to do as a uhm disc jockey 
 because i like to talk and i like to you know
listen to different different kind of music
 so it ' s really a interesting job to me
 
 yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah 
 3-words 
 2-words 
 oh
i see 
 so you are planning to take two words
well how do you 3-words 
 maybe 2-words 
 but it ' s just a dream 
 because i know that disc jockey is very low paid
 
 mm 
in hong kong 
yeah
 
really 
because without without experiences
very low paid
 
oh
i see
so now what you main goal
maybe some types of
some 
 and be uhm apart from this
uh it ' s also very hard to get into that field
because you have to lower in to lower uh some persons
who work in that field
 and recommend you
and that ' s the easier way
 
 so you 
even to the radio or tv stations
like that 
sorry
 
in in the radio 
i think there ' s a word 
 what is rajohn 
 
the radio station 
radio
 
yeah 
yeah
 
the disc joc is some uh some the center of the station
who uh 
yeah
you mean it ' s just so hard to get in such jobs 
 yeah 
yeah
because they mm there ' s where rarely some advertisement
mm post on the newspaper 
they just they just i think they mm uhm employ peoples
through people
 but not through newspaper 
you know people recommend some other persons 
and uh into that field
instead of knows by the newspaper
 
 aw 
 uh huh 
i see
so it ' s so hard for yourself 
because many people want to you know
get into the entertainment circle
 
yeah
yeah yeah 
that ' s right 
 you 
you can have a chance to earn a lot
 
uh huh 
that ' s good
yeah 
 yeah 
yeah
 
so you mean
uh 3-words your four words
uh you you uh uh uh what ' s that your ambition is to
be a disc jockeys
when you are small
but then now because of uh things
that it ' s quite hard for yourself
maybe
so what your maybe what ' s your uh tut plan 
i think i ' ll work uh in the media field
 because my sister
 
 oh well 
your sister is connected in the media field 
is
yeah
it ' s working in the me media
 
mm i see
so you can ask her some points
 pointers 
maybe 
 uh 
sorry
 
pointers
uh some feedbacks 
 s s some i mean tut uh you can
understand what feedbacks mean
mean some ideas
you can it ' s not hard in yourself
if you can take
me just because your sister was in there
 so 
she can give you some ideas like that 
 yeah
yeah
yeah 
and she can recommend me to to some post
maybe
oh
when there ' s vacancy
yeah
 
and that ' s why you are taking this kind of course 
i don't think this course is related to the media field
 i ' m just interesting in it 
yeah 
 
 oh 
 oh 
i see 
so
 
it ' s nice 
yeah
and before i took the course
i didn't know there ' s a thing called the i c e project
 
what does it mean 
what does 
it ' s just the name of the project
and what we need to do is just to collect some data
 of different
 
 and then 
you what are you going to do with it 
what uhm what we ' ll going to do with it
 with it is the is the lecturer ' s business
 not our business
we are just te 
we are just contribute 
 
 mm mm 
 oh i see
you are just contributing 
yeah
 contribute datas
yeah 
 
 oh
i see 
and then they want they wanted to to sort it out 
yeah
 
oh 
what what i need to do is just analyze the difference
or analyze some uh features or distinct 
 
 1-word you won't find
hard in analyzing 3-words you know
i think it ' s too conflict
it ' s not too conflicting
in your part to sort it out
and is it 3-words 
that that ' s give you conflict in your mind
or it ' s give you hard to sort it out 
i think it ' s quite hard to short it out
 
oh 
because uhm i ' m not familiar with the accent
 of different kinds of english
 
 yeah 
yes 
then
due to the limited knowledge
i don't think i can you know elaborate the essay
in so many pages
 
mm 
yeah
it i think it ' s a quite hard job
 
oh 
but you know it ' s it gives you maybe
does it give you uh some uh do you think it gives you
some knowledge
so that in such uh uh 
 yes 
sure
every course will 
 
 in in what way 
in what way
 
yeah
and how
and how 
 maybe give you some 
maybe some some tut ideas
and how it ' s 1-word 
yeah 
 huh 
 mm 
 for example
uh 
yeah
during this project
 yeah 
you need to 
you know uhm to take the recordings
 
yeah 
and you are forced
to some extent
 listen to other people ' s english 
and i think in this way
it can it can help training your listening of english 
 as well
 
 huh huh 
 uh huh 
 mm 
oh what is this 
do you think your mom ' s your mom ' s uh your mom ' s
son is very naughty
 
uh yeah 
chong yin 
 yeah 
very naughty
 
really 
really 
he he is he is you know that 
 yeah 
and very clever
but not on the study
 
yeah 
yeah
 
he ' s too lazy
in his study
you knows uh sometimes i they quarreling
and mrs mrs fok get mad at her
at him
because he doesn't want to do the homework
he get to just watch that tv 
sometimes your mom ' s business is not so good
you know 
and when she ' s back back home and find the son so
naughty and you know
 
 yeah i think so 
yeah 
yeah
 
he he let her get her mad 
yeah
piece her off
yeah
 
yeah
piss her off
but sometimes you know 
uh ms fok hit uh chong yin
yeah 
is it very violently
 
sometimes 3-words 
yeah
i told her not to
 
yeah i told her too
i told her mom
sometimes you know uh because uh if i am on her part
and the the i do i do going to do such things to him
but you know sometimes why is it uh i told her that 
i asked her before
why is it that uh if he ' s mad
if she ' s mad
she ' s very very mad as you as you see
you can see her that she ' s very very mad
i don't ' know even before if she ' s like that one
 
 yeah 
 you you mean 
you mean she hit the child very uh frequently 
 
 sometimes
yeah 
yeah
uh not 1-word not uh frequently
but uh sometimes if she ' s she get mad
she ' s really mad 
what is mud
mad
you mean
 
yeah
mad
means angry 
yeah
 
yeah
if she ' s angry
she ' s really very very angry
that ' s why sometimes
you know chong yin
maybe uh 2-words uh you know that
he is growing up now 
yeah
 
and uh he changed her mind
and he knows how to do anything
sometimes he just walk out 
yeah
 
 1-word did did you know that uh sometimes
it happened between the two of them 
 yeah
he ' s old enough to take any bus he like
 
yes 
yeah
he knows his way home
so he ' s not afraid of anything
 
yeah 
mm
 
and did you know sometimes that uh the two of them are 
fighting 
$a laughs 
did she told you 
$z laughs 
who wins
 
$z laughs 
of course the mommy
 yeah 
did she did miss fok told you sometimes that uh they cannot
uh they keep on arguing
did you get wing to comes to their doing their homework
 huh 
they always argue about the homework
 
yes 
yeah
 
is it alright 
mm
yeah
your mom told me 
uh is it yesterday
uhm i ' m not sure
ah joey ' s copying the letter a
 
 uh huh 
uh huh 
and when when he wrote the first a 
nothing happens
and when when he wrote the second a
and when he half finished it
he walked out of the room
just walk out of the flat
and go to the relative ' s house
 
 he 
maybe that ' s the others the other day i think
when during my holiday
because i used to go on last thursday
and then 
 mm 
 uh 
go back to philippine
 
no
no
no
just for a holiday
just stay here in tuen mun
for one day 
because that ' s our ching ming
what is that ching ming festival 
 aw aw aw 
 yeah 
yeah
 
yeah
that ' s the ching ming festival
and that ' s my holiday
so i went my i go out 
and then the two of them was left
when then when i come back 
$a laughs 
at night
i i asked
mom where is chong yin 
mm
 
she said that oh she ' s gone
he ' s gone 
 laughs 
i said what ' s happening again
but i never say to him 
tragedy
 
 1-word 
yeah
you know
and then chong yin 
the main problem is that he ' s not afraid of his mother
and uh father
yeah
because he can always escape to her you know to her
grandmother ' s flat yeah 
 
 yeah
that ' s that ' s you know sometimes that ' s a big
mistake
and afterwards
as i told her that because uh chong yin will be very hard
headed then
because they he knows that somebody will gonna tut 
 accept her 
yeah
protect her if in case because uh how 
 protect him yeah 
 and and also uhm his uh his aunt
all all think that he ' s not so naughty
 
yeah
i think so 
but uh you know they are speaking cantonese
so sometimes i cannot understand what they are talking
about 
 yeah 
 uh because joey is a very tat 
 intelligent liar
intelligent liar
yeah 
isn't he
 
 he ' s a liar
 a-few-words 
you are right 
you alright 
yeah
 
you are right 
you know he he can 
 yeah
yeah 
and a very good actor
 
 laughs 
 yeah 
 yeah 
yeah
so he ' s very clever
actually
but not in the study
if he ' s you know devote all his energy into studies
he ' s he ' s very he ' s going to be brilliant 
 
yeah
but uh the problem is he doesn't want
he just want to watch the tv
or doing playing like that
but when i asked him
chong yin have you finished your studies
are your assignment
but he said
yes
 when i ' m finished
but later on when mommy ' s comes
he never finishes it
that ' s why they are quarreling again 
i told your mom not to buy this piano for him
i say no reward for for joey because he ' s so
lazy
 
 oh 
and then what did she said
when i come back from the philippines
she told me
$a laughs oh
weny
i bought a piano for joey
for a present 
that ' s too expensive you know
yeah
it costs a lot 
 3-words 
 yeah
too expensive for the naughty child
 
yeah
but she bought it 
mm she just can't control herself
 
yeah 
you know 
 from buying things
yeah
 
but uh ms fok doesn't know how to discipline children
that ' s why 
 she try to satisfy his will
 
but uh 
 but all the time
joey ' s is against all her will
 
yeah 
yeah
 
that ' s right 
mm
 
ms fok doesn't know how to discipline chong yin
anymore 
 yeah 
sometimes he makes her cry
yeah 
and her husband just don't understand her problem
 
 yes 
i talk to ms fok when i came back
that they have a fight
that ' s he told me
i said that that you must talk to mr chan
on how you can discipline your child
because joey is already growing up
mm mm
 
you know if you just uh leave it on that way 
and if joey grow up already
it ' s too hard for you both to discipline him 
because he will never he will never follow you anymore
i don't know what happen
i don't know if they talk 
the two of them 3-words have a
conversation with regards to chong yin 
 mm 
mm and
 
it ' s good
it ' s good 1-word that uh ms fok uh is
trying sometimes to relate her her
i saw her bitterness for chong yin ' s
of her pro her problems
with with regards to chong yin 
and it ' s too hard you know it uh it ' s too hard in her part
that uh he cannot discipline chong yin anymore
because he is not afraid of her
yeah 
and her husband is not trying trying to help
 
yeah
i think so
and you know laughs 
what did he say 
 maybe maybe maybe her husband felt
that mm i was very working
i was working very hard in in china
 and when i came back
i just want to enjoy the family life 
a very quiet and peaceful life
and so and he maybe he felt that 
every time when i come back hong kong
you just quarrel and quarrel
and argue with the child
and make very noisy and tut maybe tut you know
uhm uhm what he wanted is just the you know
not to quarrel
or maybe uh stop arguing 
to put the things aside
to put the problems aside
 and and leaving everything for for your
mom 
 
 uh huh 
 aw 
 aw 
 for her 
uh i see
 that ' s why 
 yeah 
i think it ' s the main problem
yeah 
so and your mom will find that mm uhm mm you know it ' s
uh
 
did you uh uh wing ' s told herself three words
 
 every problem is 
you know
 
he gives 2-words advice
or you give her some some what ' s that
uh s ideas
how to do
 how to handle things like that 
 yeah 
maybe they sh should sit together
to find figure out some ways to you know to solve the problem
with with the child
yeah
 
well i don't know 
but they seldom talk
 
yeah
 they seldom talk
because you know or 
 yeah 
 like strangers
yeah
 
you know
sometimes
uh oh like that 
they miss fok will 1-word come home
or maybe a around eight
past eight
uh they ju they just eat
then later if you ' re gonna ask if uh you do your
assignment
and later if she found out that it ' s not okay 
hit
 hit 
hit
fight
 
 fight 
fighting again laughter 
oh
my goodness
aiya
later chong yin will be crying
crying
crying already
even 
joey cry
 
yeah
even mommy ' s not doesn't hit her yet
 him yet
but he already crying 
 mm 
mm mm
 
he said that
don't hit me
don't hit me 
$a laughs 
never hit yet
but he told her don't hit
that ' s why the mommy get 1-word 
if you 1-word 
there was was her husband here
 
usually not here 
mm
 
if they are arguing
if they are having 2-words 
 if if her husband is here
will they fight
 
no
they don't fight
to give a peaceful scene
 
i i think so
that ' s what you said 
 yeah 
yeah
 
i think so that mr chan doesn't 2-words 
noisy uh noisy surroundings 
 so so your mom is very upset
because every problem is just
 
she ' s the one handling everything
 a-few-words 
 yeah
yeah 
handling all the problems
yes
 
that ' s why sometimes
it ' s a-few-words 
yeah
 
and if he doesn't got 
if he nobody ' s talk to her
you know 
maybe the idd is expensive
 
yeah 
yeah
 
in calling to china
i don't think so 
i idd
you know 
by phone 
yeah
it ' s expensive
so they seldom talk on the phone
and when they are and when her husband came back
and she she just didn't want to repeat the same
thing again
 
 yeah
the idd 
oh
that ' s why
 yes 
 sometime you just don't understand
when i you know
maybe you ' re you get tired of 
 repeating again and again
yeah
 
 yeah 
i see 
but as uh yesterday
i talk i talk to mr chan
and i thoughts i thought what ' s on that other other day
i thought what ' s happening to chong yin there before 
you told your husband
 
no

mr chow tut 
 i thought 
who ' s mr cha
 
my bo 
mrs miss fok husband 
 oh
