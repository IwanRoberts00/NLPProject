it has been suggested that hong kong ' s five percent growth rate to this year is very healthy by the standard of developed economies
and that the three point five percent unemployment rate is low by normal international standards
the implication is that hong kong ' s economy is still in good shape and that the problem posed by the rising ranks of the jobless should not be exaggerated
the truth is those who travel on the sau ki wan minibus know very different 
no one should take for granted the plight of one hundred and ten thousand men and women who are currently out of work and that of the families that they support or help support
ours is a flourish or perish society where negative social values are attached to joblessness
the absence of the employment insurance also means that those who lost their jobs may also face difficulties in making ends meet 
the record number of unemployed itself bespeaks the poor state of the economy regardless of what optimists would like us believe
although hong kong has in the recent issue of fortune magazine been named the third most competitive economy and in an earlier issue of the same magazine was named one of the ten best cities in the world to do business there is a dearth of substantial new investment in the territory
our industry has during the past decade and a half by and large relocated to the pearl river delta and other parts of china as well as countries like thailand the philippines and vietnam
given the low value added nature of our industries that is the only way to survive
unlike the other little tigers of asia we have not developed a high tech industry because our government has done nothing to attract or encourage such industry
taiwan has its acer and vtec
korea has its lucky goldstar and samsung
singapore is host to many multinational technology leaders
what does hong kong have
some in hong kong believe that our only future lies in services
we are no doubt proud of our position as asia ' s pre-eminent financial trading and transportation center
the strength of a service economy lies in its human resources
look at the poor state of education system
a lot of employers are disappointed by the standard of the products of our schools and universities both in terms of the general knowledge as well as the language skills
there are deep-seated factors which lead to the present state of affairs and i look forward to the opportunity of elaborating on these on a future letter
the meritocratic ethos which has been the cornerstone of our success as well as that of our main competitors has now been replaced by a tolerance on mediocrity
emphasis on quality has been looked upon as elitist as arrogant as unbecoming of a democratic society
this erroneous concept and unhealthy trend must be reversed or else we shall before too long find ourselves in the tragic comic state of a society of mm mediocres pretending to provide world class service
if we cannot provide world class service we cannot compete as an international service center 
so where does our future lie
in services in high tech industry as an entreport or as a postcolonial society lost in the abyss between two cultures
i believe the answer must be that we must continue to be a leading international financial trading transportation and service center
we must develop a new industrial base built on selected high technologies
we must exploit to the full our position as the gateway to china
and we must strive to be truly bi-cultural society with the sophistication and language skills that the description demands
in finding where our future lies it would also be necessary to know where we fit in in terms of china ' s overall development strategy
will shanghai be a competing financial center
will the many ports being built in china affect our position as the world ' s leading container port
will china develop its own high tech industrial base close by hong kong
these we need to know and hong kong progressive alliance of which i am chairman will take as a priority task to find out not only from the central government of china but also from the leaders of areas like guangdong shanghai and fujan where we have many contacts
the immediate task that the hong kong government now faces will be to stimulate the economy and to attract investment
unemployment can only be tackled by creating more jobs and not by measures which affect the competitiveness of our economy such as across the board banning of the importation of workers
a less competitive hong kong would see more business failures and the loss of still more jobs
a legco and government which tried to take the easy way out by shooting scapegoats will be grossly irresponsible 
i have therefore recently in legco asked the government to consider setting up an economic development board
the board would comprise leading businessmen and professionals and be organized along the lines of the trade development council
its function would be to make recommendations to the government on issues relating to economic development to attract foreign investment human resources and technology to hong kong and to collect economic and business data from global sources
much of its work will be done through overseas offices to be established in leading international cities perhaps in the same premises as those of the trade development council
singapore ' s economic development board has served singapore well
and i believe it is high time that hong kong catches up in making a conscious effort in attracting foreign capital and other factors of production
nothing nowadays come without hard work 
a recent economic and political survey done by survey research hong kong conveys a message that public confidence in the economy has continued its downward trend 
it is hardly a surprise to me when people know that our employment rate is at a ten year high and at least hundred and five thousand of hong kong ' s three million strong labour force are not working 
with the knowledge that the government has no major safety net program available for them i believe it is indeed a big problem needs to be tackled immediately 
i am greatly disappointed that the governor ' s speech this year failed to address the most important crisis we are now facing that is measures to boost the waning economy to curb inflation and to improve the unemployment situation
i wonder if this is really the philosophy of a sunset government that no initiative can be expected from it 
the downward forecast of our economic growth rate worries me the most 
the government decrease the nineteen ninety five estimated gdp growth to five percent in real terms from five and a half percent forecast at the beginning of the year
the point is that our gdp gross was at five point nine percent
in the first quarter while the government readjusted average growth rate to five percent which means that our economic performance in the fourth quarter will be down to four and a half percent or lower 
this is a very steep decrease
this is a major problem that the trend is worrying
the disappointment is the governor said nothing to stimulate the economy and he thinks there is no problem 
i believe the success of hong kong has been founded on the respect for individual freedom free trade low tax and minimum governmen government intervention
hong kong people has the reputation of being diligent and willing to take on new challenges in a fast changing society
our current unemployment problem largely stemmed from restructuring of our economy which create a big gap between workers availability and job vacancies 
thus some tailor-made and on the job training and re-training program for the workers should be organized in order to equip the workers with the necessary skills for new employment 
the government should organize more re-training courses to meet the market demand
this is a much more positive attitude towards the unemployment problem
our economy cannot be restored only with skilled workers we also need investors whose business can provide job opportunities for our labour force 
in order to make hong kong maintaining its status as a favourable place for investors the liberal party proposes the government should lower its current salaries and profits tax by one and a half percent 
a more lenient tax system can encourage income owners and investors to spend more thus bring recovery of trade 
the cycle goes on and the economy will be boosted
i ' m grateful to my legco colleagues
we got together last week at the house committee and agreed to freeze twelve of government ' s charges for the year
i believe this is the right decision for hong kong
with government holding over four hundred and fifty billion dollars in exchange fund and a hundred and fifty billion dollars in reserve plus over one hundred billion dollars for sar government in the land fund i do not see any reason why government needs money
it is time to take measures to lower inflation 
legislators are not embedding abandoning the user pay principle
at least i ' m not
this is the only interim measure made by the legislators who understand the economic problem that we are facing today and to take measures which government is not willing to take 
in nineteen ninety one government did same thing to curb inflation by freezing fees and charges
today we have a much stronger reserve
they cannot explain to the people of hong kong why they need more money
a government is not a business
it is not government business to make money
there are many other ways to boost the sorry economy
the liberal party believes the government should also relax the seventy percent mortgage scheme which will bring more buyers in especially first time home buyers 
moreover more jobs will be provided should the government speed up the building of the infrastructure 
projects suc such as country park session of route three and the northwest railway
to build more public housing and to sell it to those who wants to buy
all of these are measures that the government can take to provide more job opportunities and to turn our economy
in brief i believe we legco members have made the right decision to freeze government charges
it is not only beneficial to the ordinary citizen but it also has the effect of suppressing inflation rate
by equip our labour force to cope with the ever-changing world and by encouraging investors to hong kong we will get through this hard period together and enter a prosperous twenty first century
another controversial topic provoking big echoes from the community is the policy speech is the sudden and made a sudden u-turn that the government by the government on the importation of labour
no one will dispute the unemloyment rate is at a serious problem for hong kong
however a cut on quota on imported labour from twenty five thousand to five thousand can only make it difficult for business to employ people with expertise which can hardly be found in the local market
i do not understand the rationale behind this proposal
as hi i have explained before the fundamental way to tackle unemployment is plainly by providing more jobs not by arguing how many imported labour should be allowed working in hong kong 
if for any reason we should restrict the number of in-coming workers the government should first strictly enforce the law to fight against illegal workers 
it is estimated there are about a hundred and fifty thousand illegal workers in the territory
so far we are not doing much to curb illegal workers
lastly i would like to comment on the controversial suggestion of the legal sub-group of the pre preliminary working committee on the bill of rights
my initial reaction is why pwc want to propose to tackle the bill of rights
the law was enacted on june fifth nineteen ninety one
many pwc members were legislators then and supported the bill
the laws of hong kong are amended upon the need of the current situation
the bill of rights was passed in nineteen ninety one and has been implemented in hong kong without major problems
hong kong people are quite accustomed with such changes and the society is functioning well
i do not see ther there is any urgency to restore the six laws mentioned by the legal sub-group
if in the future the legislative council of the sar finds problems mentioning by pwc ' s legal sub-group the bare legislature
