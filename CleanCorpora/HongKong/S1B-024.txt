good evening and welcome to newsline
""
in our programme this evening we take a look at sino-british
relations in the  wake  of mr lu ping  ' s visit  and the meeting in
hong kong of the pwc
""
then in part two of this programme we take a look at mr patten  ' s
political package uh human right commission and what might happen to the
airport proposals
""
joining us in the studio are mr tsang yuk sing a member of dab mr
james tien a member of the liberal party and mr yeung sum a member of the
udhk
""
well gentlemen we live in extraordinary times uh my first question
is   put  to all three of you
""
and that is how would you characterize the state of sino-british
relations at this junction
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
  tense
""
every  everyone everyone can can see that  lu ping came to
hong kong and he refused to see mr patten that is of course uh very uh uh
very significant uh uh sign 
""
uhm we hope that the relationship uhm  is actually it has come
to the bottom of of the trough
""
we hope that it is it it will improve uh in the next few months or
so
""
but uhm  uhm i think we have to wait for some time yet
""
""
  one-word   well   
""
uhm james do you agree with that
""
""
uhm i would say perfectly  absolutely
""
as ever since i entered politics at around eighty four and signing
of the joint declaration i would say the the the situation right now is the
worst that that i  ' ve ever seen 
""
uh it  ' s quite a in in  unimaginable that uhm  director lu
ping comes in would not even meet uh christopher uhm patten our governor uh
even for a handshake or have a short talk about what things are about hong
kong
""
  that  ' s why all the hong kong people are worry 
""
""
 worse than what it was after   june fourth
""
""
no i would say so
""
""
yeung sum
""
""
i i think mr tsang has used the word tense to describe the
nature or the kind of relationship between two government
""
obviously it is true  but i just hope that they can be more
rational and mature enough not to spread this kind of relationship for too
long
""
and things like building the airport it is of mutual interest
""
and it is particularly to the interest of people in hong kong
because the british government will end the rule  uh three years later you
know
""
the later the airport built you know and the more expensive it  ' ll
become
""
so i don't see why they have this kind of  one-word
 over the politics  should be  ex  spread to other fields
""
""
  well but  judging from what what has happened
in past couple years
""
especially  uh judging from the uhm fac report uh released early
   
""
there was a revision  in british policy on hong kong and towards
china after june fourth
""
uh  and especially after uhm mr patten arrived as governor of
hong kong
""
i think china is now revising her policy towards hong kong and
towards uh uh britain
""
uhm china came to the conclusion after the breakdown of
sino-british uh election talks  towards the end of last year
""
china came to the conclusion that it is impossible to rely the
british for a smooth transition to nineteen ninety seven so this 
""
i think this means uhm uhm uhm very  uhm significant change in
uhm how china formulate her policy on hong kong
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
this is to be expected but of course this does not mean in the
words of mr qian qi shen that in other areas the two sides cannot cooperate
just because they   are  arguing with each other on  
the  political package
""
  doesn't  mean they can't cooperate on the airport on
uh cross boarder smuggling and that sort of affairs
""
""
 no  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
i think both sides want to cooperate but with mutual trust
lacking
""
uh i think simple things simple matters would become complicated
and complicated matters would simply become uh insolvable
""
""
  i think they  can build up the bridge over the gap
by  by having the interest of people in hong kong in their mind
""
i mean just like the airport or the economic  cooperations 
or or the security uhm measures you know all over the border or the traffic
over the border
""
i mean if both government put the interest of people in hong kong
in their mind i think  the gap can be  bridge 
""
""
 uhm uh  
""
""
uhm
""
""
one of the first   causalities  of this state of
tension   in  sino-british relations is of course the demise of
the through train
""
i mean   this  is not going to happen anymore
""
uh james was your party disappointed that even a partial through
train which was the concept    which  you talked about 
could not now be sustained
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
very  in fact in the last week we had a chance to see uh lu ping
for a couple of times  both at the business parties uh luncheon with him
""
and as a hong kong advisor  and we kept emphasizing that uh if
we could uh amend the current ninety three uh nine ninety two proposal on
electoral uh reform to somewhat closer to the uh basic law
""
would there a chance of if not a total through train at least a
partial uh through   train and i would say  liberal  
party   was very  disappointed
""
they  ' re they  ' re saying that whatever we do  uh everyone gets
up the train and uh we  ' d have to be reelected again uh in ninety seven
""
of course their difference of saying that  uh if the uh form of
election is correct   then  the candidate can always
re-participate and get yourself reelected
""
but that certainly is not our thinking of some kind of a through
train
""
  our  kind of through train is   you 
are elected by ninety five you could stay on to uh nineteen ninety nine and
not really get off and reelect again
""
  we  ' re  using the argument if you  ' re  electable
 in ninety five you should be  electable  again in ninety seven
""
""
 uhm and the answer was no  
""
""
 yeah no  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 right  
""
uhm  one-word  the through train of course does
not only cover    legislators and  uh urban  
councillors and so on
""
it  also refers to the civil service and this is one area 
 where  a lot of people are really concerned
""
especially civil   servants  uhm why is china taking
such   a tough  stance on that mr    tsang 
""
""
""
 no  
""
 no  two-words   
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
""
 no  
""
 i  
""
no i don't think there  ' re any problem with uh  with the
transition of civil of of the civil service
""
  well  uh of course the basic law require us that uhm
for the uhm senior  posts in the civil service they have to be 
nominated by the uh chief executive and appointed by the central government
  that that  is the basic law right
""
but for  the the majority for for the bulk of the civil service
i don't think china has has at any time     uhm uhm raised
any hints that uhm they cannot take the so called through train
""
through train simply isn't a problem isn't an issue in in the civil
service
""
""
 uhm  
""
 and that  
""
 uhm  
""
  but in 
""
""
  two-words   
""
""
it  ' s interesting about the concept of through train because
in the past we just told that uh  some people are labelled as being
subversive
""
so they can cannot take on the through train
""
and now that it seem the chinese government expand the concept 
that all three tiers you know the  legislature  coun  uh urban
council and then the district board has to be disbanded and reelection will
have to take place
""
so  it doesn't just hit on a few few people    you know
yeah 
""
""
 but i don't think i don't think  
""
i i think think the uh concept through train only 
""
it has always only applied to the legislative council   
because because if there  ' s nobody  talk about through train in other
areas     but   we 
""
""
 no it  ' s yes it  ' s expensive now  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 if   that is the case why  why does china
want to disband every single   structure 
""
""
  but    that  ' s   set up  for
the civil servant
""
actually my view on the civil servant  is that we don't have
much to worry about
""
cause right now all they  ' re saying is that it  ' s no longer  uh
uh what the civil servant act
""
it  ' s it  ' s rather simply pro-governor or not
""
if you listen to the governor so you will be today  ' s sort of uh
high flyer then they  ' ll throw you off the train   and they think
there  ' s enough  for the civil servant   uh uh 
qualifications   in  in hong kong that if the top tiers that go
now
""
they can easy find replacement and probably my personal feeling is
that we do have the depth in our civil services     in a
director grade or the assistant secretary grade or the deputy uh grade that
that will not be a major problem for us   in  the civil service
""
""
 i  
""
""
 is it someone said that  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 in  
""
is this an attempt to undermine the credibility of the governor
and his ability to govern
""
i mean if that is the case that is bad enough in it is in uh in
itself       as it is 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
  one-word  i think   there  ' s
some truth in that  uh statement
""
well because if you say that you support fully the political
reform of uh governor patten today
""
then obviously that is against uh what china  ' s interpretation of
the basic law are
""
and therefore the after ninety seven uh either you  ' ll have to
wait and see or they will replace with someone who may be equally capable
""
""
then we have a political problem because the sino-british
joint declaration   specifically said  that the administration
of hong kong   all  the way to nineteen ninety seven is the
responsibility of the british   government 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
 so it is  
""
  so it is 
""
i actually i i  ' m not worry about the uhm civil service at all
""
now if a senior civil servant     uhm  is now
doing his his or her job competently and seen by the public  as doing a
good job
""
i don't think  the chinese or or or the new sar government will
throw him or her     out of his his   his or her
 post
""
i don't i don't think that   alright 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 but mr   tsang has seem is that someone from
the chinese government that they have to declare the   loyalty 
""
""
 no   no no   no no 
""
""
 is it   a rumour
""
""
no
""
it is in in a very inaccurate report    
""
that  ' s the problem with the uh with the pwc
""
  on  one hand people want pwc to uh  to to hold
the their discussions in the open
""
  they  want to know  uh  uh what actually
takes place   during  the pwc meeting
""
but  the pwc of course is a working  uh uh group
""
  it is  a working body it has to look into the all
the possible problems and to and to find solutions
""
so it is nature for members of the pwc to ask questions like well
how can we assure  that the uh civil service posts will all be  
uh  filled in nineteen ninety seven    
""
how can we assure that uh we won't have uh a mass  excer 
exodus of   of  civil servants   from  hong kong
""
  now  although it is very unlikely  
they have to uhm they have to ask et cetera 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
 then even if we talk about certain civil  
servants being unacceptable
""
  don't  you think that the most that we could talk
about is a handful
""
  no more  than three four or five
""
we  ' re not talking about    hundreds  or  
even tens 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 i don't think  
""
""
  one-word  tens  
""
  e even so we  should we shouldn't label a few isn't
it
""
  i mean by  labeling a few that they are not
friendly to the chinese government it just hit upon the   moral
 one-word  yeah 
""
""
 i don't think any  
""
 no no  
""
 exactly exactly   and i   think 
""
""
 the   top civil servants   might just
 carry out the instruction of the governor that  ' s our feel that  ' s my
feeling   
""
but  still  may not be their personal feeling  but if
the instruction is such such from   governor 
""
they will just do it so it not it may not   be  their
personal view
""
""
 we shouldn't  
""
""
 but i think i think the chinese government  
""
""
 uhm  
""
 sure  
""
""
sure exactly
""
""
yeah
""
""
so i i  ' m sure the uh the the chinese government especially
the senior officials have been careful   not  to label  
in individual  civil uh servant   as  well uh  
unacceptable 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah so so  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
""
true
""
so far they haven't specifically said     many
many   names 
""
""
 no  
""
 no 
""
""
 alright   let me pick you up  on another
point 
""
you said mr tsang that you are not worried about the civil
service
""
now that suggests that you are worried about the three tiers
structure because mr lu has said you know this will be dismantled in
nineteen ninety seven
""
as you said the through train referred to legislative councillors
so why did china extend this dismantling exercise to the urban council 
min  municipal council and and the district   broad 
""
""
 well   why why did the why did the british agree
to talk to china  about the ninety four election as well
""
if it was only the ninety five legco election that was in question
""
so obviously there had to be agreements between the two
governments on all three tiers for the for this smooth transition
""
now i i  i don't think the term uhm disbanding or dismantling
uh is appropriate at all to describe the state of  affairs  happening
  in ninety seven 
""
""
 how would you   describe it
