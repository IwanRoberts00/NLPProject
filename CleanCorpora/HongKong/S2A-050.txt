<I>
can the back hear me okay okay
so in case if my voice level drops please let me know 
uh today it ' s basically i ' m going to uh go through with you about
certain experience uh in the past few years or time 
there has been uh use of image imaging for a long period of time
begin begin from the microfilm one word 
uh the first time we we bring in the microfilm into hong kong
operations should go back to nineteen fifty to eighty 
and our first electronic imaging systems those in july 
operations in nineteen eighty nine
a lot days it ' s we ' re going uh total of three different sections
two of them is on medium platform
one of them is running on one word platform
so in the future years to come we are going to have uh more moving
system uh more application added in 
if we look at the present imaging market fax uh here summarize what
was happened in the market
the first thing the growth of leadership is more than what
people has expected
and again they tin industry typically on the electronic
side begins in the early eighties
a lot of friend as a users and its patterns is growing 
and the faster
that ' s because ultimately it ' s going to have the bottom line and
have the globalization of the several words operating
cost in two thing the operating efficiency having uh more satisfied customs
however uh it is not as expect expected
so one of the reason why it it ' s not growing as fast as many
because in the early days of imaging systems all of them are one
word 
so once you beginning or putting in your application in one system
subsequently you will find hard to move or migrate those
applications to other platform or other systems
uh it ' s still pretty much with most of the japanese systems
available today alright
it ' s really hard to migrate the information from the japanese
manufacture ports over into more general platforms
uh but it ' s less to on all the american products and still prevent
a coming back from the m sold last month from the usa
uh a lot of systems today available in the market the hardware is
basically unimportant because you can use a common hardware they had or
unique always certain imaging components and the software
you can start one at a very low uh entering cost
the other way that ' s the people tend to focus on the wrong areas
when the imaging system first come up people start focusing the
application or replacing the filing cabinets
replacing microfilm right
but now it ' s still soon the same
the microfilm couldn't stay forever
and the other thing is the table filing cabinet is also
going to stay forever
if you look at at the worldwide sales the big cast filing system
sold in the world today is still filing cabinet and they will one
word 
it ' s not electronic imaging
so people tends to focus on the wrong area and then ultimately it ' ll
find the you know the area one word is expensive costly
to maintain
it ' s difficult to migrate and it doesn't serve at this such
purpose
another thing a lot of course starts at that m project
uhm people think uh imaging is going to help organization so let
those in put in a few systems that they around the date without any task or
looking at how you ' re going to migrate to the future
so at the end to begin at the wrong point and ending at the
position they don't know how to migrate and how to move
so at the end out of there ' re a lot of fluctuation and the and the
user side
and the next thing is an unfill unfulfilled expectations
when the elec electronic imaging comes about people tends
to compare imaging with three d processing
but in fact they are not the same now
people expect you can take over imagine quickly as quickly as you
can keep a key and then you get a a thing immediate on the screen
and you expect it is going to cure all problem in the organization
it is a medicine and is suitable for sort of disease in the
organization
so the end result is sooner or later the people now they find out
 it is not the only thing going to solve the operation problem 
there are so many business problem uh you you you you you can't 
just relay on electronic imagining system to solve
and lastly the situation in the market is still
people is very excited about the technology and how it can be used
in the organization to help the overall operational improvements
but again it also costs a computer where you ' re going to start and
how you are going to use the technology
and where the technology is moving over in the future
so basically in the coming part of my talk i ' m going to sum up
some of the main issues about the imaging applications
now the first thing is before putting in an imaging system you
got to really understand your operate culture
different organization having different culture and having
different operation principle procedure and culture 
all this is going to affect the efficiency of the imaging system
you ' re going to put in
one typical example is in managing organization you all or need to
have a very strong audit function or very strong control function
today when you are running a paper filing system they won't ask you
a question
if there is a fire in your filing room what will have
they won't ask you this question because they know there ' s no
solution
but when you bring in an imaging system they will ask
well you should back up this one another media use of fill 
another duplicate system
the serve at this one word system
what happen
the end result is you are not going to cost the system set up right
the technology all kinds of potential improvement but it is also
all kinds of the potential of misuses and abuse the technology
putting in a lot of things which are unimportant
today when in a mail room when you receive the correspondence it is
sent through to different people for processing and it end up in a filing
cabinet
the uhh count how many mail you receive a day to the filing room
and to recognize how many mail receive are actually filed you know
uh when you bring in an imaging system they will say okay you go to
lock every mail you go to recognize all this two words 
or management statistic reports
somebody go to check what happen
the end result is you increasing the what what of the people uh
they is what
so you got to nearly know the one word culture
about how you are going to deal with the technology and what are the thing uh
actually required and what are not required
uh another example is one word on the platform
different organization because of the culture and the belief and
when they beginning to put in computer system they uh putting the systems on
the platform they think they are the best 
but the thing that the best may not mean those platforms are
actually people using in common in the market place
now the end result is the organization may be ending of in running
a lot of one word software or one word
 equipments
so then when you start using imaging system you ' ll find it ' s hard
to inoperate the imagining application with the dp functions if
there are so many profound base income okay
so without knowing the platform you ' re in
so it ' s hard to build the application and typically you go to know
all the hardwares you had
otherwise the end up situation is the all place you would
had
two or three different monitor on the street on the or setting the
cooperating database on the profile you perform then you got another set of
pc accessing your imaging uh records
and all this is basically affecting the virtual design either
efficiency or the mobility a long pause 
uh the next thing is what is the best imaging application
barriers
now there will be certain criterias uh you can
identify which are the most suitable imaging application areas
the end result is as i mention paper filing cabinet is going to
continue and microfilm is going to continue but because there will be certain
application it ' s never you can justify using electronic imaging
so the first thing you are looking at those easy cost justify
application
one of the major difference between paper filing and 
electronic imaging is on the paper filing or also on microfilm record keeping
system is very dub the paper into the filing cabinet
the chance of retrieving those information will be very low
and in general statistically we are expecting less than one
percentage of information in the filing cabinet or microfilm we are going to
retrieve it
so if you try to look at application when you other file it ' s
probably you won't retrieve it at all
it ' s hard to cost several words application
the those easy marks are basically we are looking at applications
uh you file a lot of paper and you also retrieve a lot of paper
from your system
then basic cut off amount we are looking at is a thirty percent
chance of the paper in the filing system you are going to retrieve it
regularly
the first application we are putting in operations it con 
it ' s contain the around twenty three thousand files
the the day that we keep the file is eighty thousand
the files it ' s nearly every of file
people will touch of a point in in a few days time
so under that kind of situation you ' ll find it is not suitable to
put on the paper or we call microfilm
imagining is the very suitable technology to solve those problems
the second important issue is when you putting in your first
application you should look into the application which is not two
word 
 two word will mean those whom directly affect
 two words mind
if something happen on the system you can wait for manners
you can wait for fixing up or the programmes up before you put the
system back into operation 
the basic principles if you try to put on the critical areas you
will put a lot of pressure on yourself
i made it better you can paper clip to make sure every thing will
work perfect
but in real life and all systems we don't expect when the system
gets all the graph will be as school as the street
the next thing is the neg neglected issue
i have read the uh attendance list today uh before coming here
uh some of you come from banks
those of still coming from banks you are lucky because uh
by the banking ordinance in hong kong uh we can basically produce micro uh
the the the optical disc images or even face coming up on the new media in
the cost of book as records as transaction evidences
uh those who not working in banks uh in hong kong they still don't
have any registration about the imaging media
uh the only thing we have is only on microfilm
other than that then we may important thing of optical disc
putting those thing on the magnetic or you put it into a new uh digital video
in the future
you ' ll face a problem of how to put this information in low
cost
the only chance that behind is either you keep paper or the
normal clip paper in order to put those back in low cost
so legal issue is one of the thing uh we have to consider and that ' s
why it ' s easy for or usually more easy to start with imaging system of
looking at certain records with which you don't really you have produced the
cost
or you won't suit the several words for those
those uh applications
the other thing is this retention requirement
each record is basically having a retention mark
the one word line will pose a problem to the
electronic imaging systems because we know if you put it on the other places
you call it recycle information network
if you put it on optical disc most of the several words
the day that may come in one hundred years but of course how long
will they last
so if you got a record you got a problem last for a long period of
time
for example when you sign your application form for credit
card and send it back to the bank uh a at the age of twenty one years and
keep using the card until the day you retire at sixties and you die at
eighties years old right
so basically the bank will have to keep the the record of sixty
one years for rent but that is not the end of it
it will depending whether you got any any any comment orders or
old date or anything left behind
it will end up those record you have to drag on for at least
another seven to thirties years before the end and destroy
if you you ' re rich man right uh and you also lay on uh
certain uh fee of the bank and the trustee cooperations and and the
far you want to affect your grandsons one word 
the the the the the the the condition you set the end result it
will be the file will have to leave for hundred and hundred of years
so you got to put it on the el electronic imaging system
you got two problems
now the first problem is how long the media can last
the second problem is the day apply something of optical disc
can i still read it two hundred years later right
uh certainly the disc is okay
do you still have the drive
so this will most the concern about the retention uh uh list
so the whole situation is if you begin with something you don't
really have to keep it at home and you don't have any strict retention
requirements
and obviously it ' s easier to begin to put it there in 
the next one is the high impact area which when you put in the
imaging system you ' ll see actually the obvious change
therefore the papers disappear you don't require so many people to
work on those things uh turn from market group right
and there must be usually in a situation that the operation is
highly rely on it without paper and those all ball pens uh 
the next one is the complicated courses for permanent 
check in this system and this is the part today most of the imaging 
three words uh the selling
they selling workforce management softwares help you to allocate
the work help you to stream line the workforces
so this is the part of the imaging system can be useful
but again uh the basic question is imaging one word
 coming workflow will improve the operation and then the expression
is
can you improve the workflow without image
the answer is yes
this is not nothing new
this is called organizational method in the old days
we call management service in modern place or uh something service
 you know today
you don't actually have to use imaging technology to improve the
workflow basic on base quickly
it ' s just base to rely on the manual system
and lastly is you got the load of million volume paper and work
overhead
although we are moving high volume paper today but then the
situation is uh why don't we say high or heat
the reason is when you got high paper volume there is a lot of
other investment or consideration you have to take care
first how fast can the scanner scan
second is how fast can your network support the transmission for
those information
so when you run into the high volume areas they will become very
complicated of handling the operation
so it ' s usually good for low to medium work uh low to medium work
what we mean is or you can fluctuate between five hundred pages to let say uh
ten thousand pages a day
then will be an ideal situation
uh if you ' re running into an application you are going to have
have a half million page half half a million page of document a day
you ' ll find it becomes very complicated in the system design will
occur a lot of cost in the one word of how to capture
all these paper quickly
