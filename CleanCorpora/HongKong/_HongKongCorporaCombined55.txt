find any food to eat    how you knew that   yeah   yeah  yeah i don't know hong kong ' s so expensive   because  hong kong is very expensive  but uh maybe we accustomed to it    yeah  yeah yeah  but hard maybe in europe there ' s only bread to eat is it   no it ' s plenty there  plenty there  for example its food chinese food    yeah   no it  yeah there ' s supermarket now chinese supermarket  chinese supermarket     yeah   when gas school we are come from this chinese supermarket  what is it mean   uh know two-words or something like  that   two-words     yeah   is it uh owned by uh china

germany france   i think   it ' s expensive  uhm  germany is also good you know how to speak german   yeah little bit  is it pop uh is it necessary to use to speak german and france in germany and friends   uhm yes yeah uh yeah yes   becour the because the people did not  said to you     well the the germans uh particular because they won't speak to you  they won't speak to you     but if you will try to speak german they will help you  if you don't speak german they are not interested  why  yeah their proud then     france yeah  yeah yeah yeah oh yeah   why  the but i think that the france the french people is proud   french are similar  similar  less less prouder than them    but not not quite as proud as them yeah  but in hong kong is good because everybody likes to talk to  yeah i think so     it doesn't mark a you know uh  and they ' ve like uh fast speak chinese uh hong kong people like uh   yeah  and they will smile   laughs    yeah yeah yeah  because you look so funny   yeah cause i cause i get it all wrong anyway  uh you also have to speak french in france uh  oh terrible then i can't travel to there    yeah  oh no no no you don't have to  yeah you don't have to   because i don't know how to but when i want to proof for example when i want to buy something then how how can i talk with them when watching out the price of the food uh then how can i communicate with them   uh  by gestures   yeah yeah  yeah   that ' s what i do here as far go to market here   but you can now you can learn know how to speak cantonese  a little bit     yeah but  yeah but before i knew i was just go like that uh how much of something like that and they know what you ' re saying  and then you don't know what     i ' ll i ' ll get them to write it down  but you write it in english   yeah  they don't know how to read english is it some people   i think so yeah two-words   then how can you communicate you think they do not know english is it   yeah but most that are like shopkeepers in that  uhm uhm   they know how to write numbers  oh   especially if they want your money  yeah yeah   yeah  especially when they want to cheat your money   laughs    yeah yeah yeah  not earn your money   yeah   ngaai yo cantonese=what-a-pity  have you ever been cheated in hong kong   cheated  yeah   and no i always bargain  yeah is it is it successful    yeah  yeah even in the big department stores i ' ll bargain  that means that they always cheat people when  they do not bargain    yeah  yeah  uhm   but it ' s   do you think uh ha   it ' s a very commercial city  not like britain   uh you can't bargain really in britain  there ' s a fixed price     just fixed price yeah  oh   it ' s crazy  the price is   although same as uh wish you know how much you gonna to pay for  something   uh do you think hong kong is a materi  materialistic society   uh a long pause  i don't know  compare for example compare with britain   no i think britain ' s more materialistic  yeah   yeah  because uhm my friends said that uhm people in hong kong when compare with uh other foreign countries do not  one-word always uh buy clothes  always buy the uhm the items that are very expensive    but the pe   here   yeah yeah but they depend like it doesn't affected people  it doesn't affect but you mean that the british will do something to affect the other people to do harm to the other people     not not do harm but to become very selfish   several words    whereas in hong kong   but i also think that the hong kong people are very selfish   yeah   yeah     but you still got good family values you look after your family you look after your mother and father   but i think that the values are decline   yeah yeah  it ' s a pity   deterioration  yeah   uhm  there are many tut bad news in  one-word newspaper    yeah  but whereas before maybe one hundred years ago like that   laughs   no seriously   you just read news the history of hong  kong    yeah  no but in in england a hundred years ago was a family society family centered is it   yeah  you have to look after   yeah you everybody look after everybody else it was the whole family to help each other yeah but now it ' s all forgotten   yeah  yeah they are very de independent i think    un  when i was here in hong kong the last time  it was very family orientated but as you say now it ' s changing  ten years before you mean   yeah  yeah i think so   it ' s change a lot the last ten years  uhm because i think i don't know what is the reason behind   just progress  the progress   yeah  i think it ' s something influence     yeah what was like we would say about malaysia early you say backward and that  uhm   that ' s very family orientated don't you think  i don't know but i know that singapore is very family centered   yeah  because there ' s a there is the law which ask the people to look after the elderly    uh ha  is it a law  law   uhm uhm  if they don't look after they will committee the crime  it ' s something like committee the crime some people say it to me is it uhm i think it ' s raymond said it to me  yeah he asks me not to go to singapore  not to travel to singapore  because you have to uhm obey many rules    uh ha   uh ha   uhm uhm uhm uhm   yeah   yeah  yeah yeah   for example not to throw any rubbish  yeah yeah     that ' s right  that ' s good  otherwise you have sweep the floor for how many days  i don't know     that ' s right   yeah   yeah  it ' s very strange   kelvin one-words  you remember kelvin  yeah  kelvin in kuala lumpur is it    is it  uh no he ' s from singapore  he ' s from singapore  oh     not kelvin brown  you think he ' s kelvin brown do you    yeah   i think of kelvin brown  because he ' s travel to k l is it    yeah

fion say that he is better than us   uh ha  and also uhm tut mandarin i don't know    yeah  and english  i i think i think so  he say that ' s there are many rules in singapore    yeah  very  many rules in singapore    yeah  yeah  that ' s why he likes hong kong one-word      but he he had to  he got in trouble for dropping litter and he got community hours or community service he had to sweep the street for so many hours yeah   yeah uh  yeah   uh he ' s in trouble   oh that ' s terrible  that don't then do does he like singapore   yes his home town  do does he got a family   he ' s married
