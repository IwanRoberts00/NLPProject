""
the failure of the sino-british high-level talks on the
airport will not immediately delay the project and it  ' s hoped that with the
new governor in place a solution could be expedited

among the ten airport core projects only two of them  the
airport itself and the rail link are in the scope of the sino-british dispute
over financing
""
funding for the other eight projects are provided for in the
public works budget or through privatization 
""
tenders for the site formation contract for the airport is due to
be called in late august

but legislator samuel wong among others believes two to three
months delay will not hurt the project
""
""
i don't think it will uh  unless it it drag on for say uh
half a year or a year
""
otherwise it won't
""
i think it it it it will uh pretty much uh uh business going on as
usual 
""
uh what the argument at the moment is uh the the the financing
method and how to deal with this uh uh callable equity
""
how to account for it in in in in terms of accountancy and so on
uh balance sheet and so on
""
uh and the that will certainly affect the ability to borrow money
at a cheaper rate during the year of say nineteen ninety-three and nineteen
ninety-four

work on the rail link won't start until the end of next year
