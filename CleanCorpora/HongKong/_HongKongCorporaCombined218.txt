uhm the po leung kuk is one of the most established uh charitable organization in hong kong and bou leuhng  means to protect the innocence and guhk means uh association organization and and the po leung kuk now today is famous for its comprehensive social recreational and educational services for children uhm the handicap and the elderly but in fact when uh the kuk was established in uh eighteen seventeen-eight uh its establishment was necessitated by the great problem of uh kidnapping uh uh kidnapping of uh women and children uhm for domestic services uh adoption marriage and prostitution  and in fact uhm some of the destitutes involved were muih jai  or domestic servant girls and actually kidnapping is just one of the  abuses uhm that muih jai might encounter other than this uh for example they might be uh overworked  beaten up or sexually harassed by their masters  the po leung kuk cared for different kinds of abuse  muih jai > regardless whether they had been kidnapped or not  the term muih jai is a cantonese colloquial  expression in written chinese or for mandarin speaking people uhm  muih jai this term is expressed a uh as uh bi nu  or peih neuih okay uhm  uh bi nu means uh domestic servant so uhm although muih jai can be interpreted as uh small uh small girls and small uhm adopted uh daughters or uhm younger sister actually uhm the girls muih jai were actually domestic servants  according to the muih jai custom a girl was transferred directly or indirectly from her family to another family uhm  for the purpose of being uhm a domestic servant  uh indirectly means uh they might be uh transferred through a middleman  okay  and during the transfer money was given by the prospective master  to the girl ' s family and the customary practice was that a  muih jai did not receive any regular wage but uhm her master was obliged to provide her with sufficient lodging clothing accommodation and medical care  when the girl was uhm eighteen years old uhm usually uhm the uh master was also obliged to find a suitable husband for her  uhm if the muih jai ' s parents or other family members desired to recover the girl before the girl reach eighteen years old  the family members had to uh repay the money uh which they receive from uhm the masters during the transfer  the system muih jai system existed in chinese  society since time immemorial but uh still in the early twentieth century the practice pervade in the colony  the census for the year uh nineteen twenty-one is the only census  which shows the estimated number of uh muih jai uh in hong kong and we find that there were altogether uhm the sixth item of the first table there are there were around eight thousand muih jai uh in nineteen twenty-one and we find that the system pervade in the colony in the sense that you find that uhm  being being a muih jai was the sixth most common uh occupations among the whole chinese population and as for uh the female population alone uh it rank the third so uh it ' s a very popular uh occupation of the day  and you can also find that uhm concerning the natures of the occupations uhm uhm in which uhm females are uh were engaged you find that most of the work were related to uh domestic works needlework domestic servants uhm muih jai or being a cook uh domestic servants here uh in the census this term refer to to some paid uh domestic servants that means uh they were receiving uhm regular uhm monetary wages uhm but for the defenders of the muih jai  system they claim that uh muih jai uh were also paid in the sense that uh lodging accommodation or medical care uh should be also be regarded as a kind of wage  this is uhm how the defenders uh try to defend the system  saying that muih jai were actually paid servants  okay  however it is difficult to prove the problems of of abuse  on the one hand it was not until december nineteen twenty-nine that  muih jai were required to be registered  moreover uh registration was not uh uhm strictly enforced  a number of masters evaded registration by calling their domestic servants adopted daughters yeuhng neuih instead in nineteen thirty the anti- muih jai society claim that at least four thousand muih jai had evaded registration in that way  it is not known how far the estimate is correct but anyway the documents uh of the po leung kuk archives do reflect such disguise and i will uh explain more about uhm the archives later  very often such disguise was uncovered when the owners described their muih jai as yeuhng neuih while the girls identified themselves as muih jai or when the girls call themselves yeuhng neuih but their adopted parents  jyu yahu masters on the other hand the ignorance of the girls themselves also accounted for the fact that a number of abuses were not reported  but such ineffectiveness does not necessarily imply that uhm m  most of the muih jai were maltreated there were still uhm a wide range of possibilities between uhm being maltreated and being well-treated uh we didn't know  uhm but nevertheless the po leung kuk archives documents show that abuse did exist although uh we can't prove the to what extent abuse  uh was prevalent  nature of abuse  for example uhm for the year nineteen twenty-three there were three cases concerning masters afflicting gross cruelty on their  muih jai and in nineteen twenty-nine seven and what does that mean  for instance in nineteen twenty-three a muih jai ' s  chest was burnt by her master simply because she had broken a cup and in nineteen twenty-nine another muih jai was severely caned for carrying water late while another girl had to massage  her mistress till midnight every day and here are some other kinds of uh abuses inflicted on muih jai  the second col no the second row masters reselling or intending to s resell their  muih jai as prostitutes and then girls kidnapped by adoption or decoyed for the purpose of selling them to other masters as muih jai or prostitutes   muih jai sexually harass by their masters or male members at their work workplaces  and actually you you you you will find that uhm it seems that the number of cases uh is very small uhm but i will explain why there were just uh one cases or just a few cases discovered uh for certain kind of uh  abuses  i will explain this later  and i have mentioned the po leung kuk archives for a number of times and now i ' m going to uhm give you more details about it  and my presentation that follows will be made according to these headlines the daily operation of the kuk  how abuse was discovered  the colonial government relied on the voluntary organizations of the chinese community especially the tung wah hospital established in uh eighteen sixty-nine uhm to fight the abuse of the muih jai  custom and uh since nine since eighteen seventy-eight with the establishment of the po leung kuk it was the po leung kuk which specialize in  uhm combating uh the those inherent in the muih jai  custom  the government was delighted with the formation of the kuk as it help to relieve the government ' s social responsibility and finan  and financial burden related to the destitute muih jai  okay  uhm since eighteen eighty the po leung kuk had employed two special chinese detectives to uncover kidnap cases they their wages being defrayed out of the society ' s fund they were called ngam chaai uhm an chai meaning secret detectives  since eighteen ninety-two district watchmen they were the security guards of the chinese population literally called gang lihn  geng lian in chinese  they were seconded to the kuk as detectives who were paid by the society  in the nineteen uh in the twentieth century as the kuk ' s documents show the district watchmen took up more duties than it was first intended for them they were not only investigators but also the runners for the kuk uhm they helped destitutes search for their parents relatives or friends help the police to bring destitutes to the secretary for chinese affairs office and then the po leung kuk for investigation or help the sca secretary for chinese affairs to transfer them to charitable  organizations which would look for their parents or make other proper arrangements for them and this will explain later  on the other hand it must be noted that investigation was also undertaken by the po leung kuk ' s associate organizations or individuals within or beyond the colony  with the assistance the workload of the kuk and the detectives was uh uh alleviated and the efficiency of investigation could be promoted  besides the documents in the archives related to the muih jai practice for the years nineteen o one twenty-three twenty-nine and forty reveal that it was only in the nineteen twenties that ordinary people came forward to report on abuses it was usually the girls themselves or their parents and relatives who lodged complaints or sought assistance at times the neighbor of a muih jai ' s master or even a passerby who witness abuse make such reports and this inspiring atmosphere uhm began to grow uhm in the early nineteen twenties and this growth is much more apparent uh throughout the nineteen thirties how cases were handled at the kuk  whenever a po leung kuk detective found a suspected person uh that means uh suspected of uh having kidnapped a girl he was obliged to inform the s secretary for chinese affairs uhm or the registrar general uh before nineteen thir thirteen of the case and take the person involved to the sca ' s office first  the sca would inquire into the case  yet very often the little girls might be unable to or unwilling to clarify their situations because of their fear of the authorities or they might have been forced and taught by the kidnappers or their owners to tell lies  therefore the sca would send uhm the muih jai to the sca uh sorry uh the sca would send the victims to the po leung kuk where they would be interviewed  uhm occasionally the girls were discovered by the police or the harbour master ' s office  it might also be muih jai themselves who reported to the police similarly the girls would be taken to the sca ' s office which would keep a record of them then they would be referred to the uh po leung kuk for further questioning and investigation  a muih jai taken to the kuk would be interviewed by at least two directors  she would be questioned about her personal particulars her family and whether she would like to be restored to her family or her masters alike  uhm  and this uh all these testimonies were compiled as  testimonies of inmates of the kuk and this is one type of uhm important information we can get from the po leung kuk archives testimonies of destitutes staying in the po leung kuk lauh guhk uaahn fuh yuh hau gung bouh and as far as i know uh after i have uh wri written up uh my thesis i know that uh the po leung kuk uhm had already uhm made a systematic uh tran uh translation uh of these uh works uh so maybe uh you may get different names uh  the name may not be testimonies of destitutes staying uh in the in the po leung kuk uh i don't know uh what names they have given uh uh to those uhm uh documents  yet sometimes there were dishonest girls who tell lies to  conceal their misconduct for instance in nineteen twenty-three a muih jai  called uh leih yih la told the sca that she was enticed  to leave her mistress by a man who wanted to marry her but the mistress complained to the sca that the muih jai had uhm and the man might have stolen her jewelry and the girl was sent uh by the sca to the po leung kuk where the directors uh question the girl and finally it was found that the girl did steal the jewelry  in fact not only the girls but all persons involved would be summoned and questions by uh the directors they might be uh their parents or their uh uh masters or any  anyone uhm in the in the girls ' workplaces  to ensure the reliability of the information obtained similarly testimonies were prepared for them and you can find here number two testimonies of outsiders  outsiders refers to uh persons other than the inmates of uh the po leung kuk or other than the words of the po leung kuk  yes and i have a photocopy uhm of the testimonies involved and you find that uh i have to cross out part of the private names of uh of the girls because uh we have to protect their privacy and uh for documents uh of the nineteenth century you don't need to go through uh this uh crossing out process okay you are you are free to uh to make photocopies on on those uh documents but for the documents uh of the twentieth century uhm the staff would uh would uh carefully examine whether uh those private names had been uh properly cross out  all the documents are written in chinese and uh just a very small amount are written in uh uhm in english and most probably uhm the  the correspondence between uhm between a particular society uh with uh the kuk so actually uh over nine ninety percent of the the documents are written in chinese and uhm and you are going to read some of those uh copies of the of the documents and you find that uh they are not only written in chinese but some very grassy uh chinese calligraphy so uhm before you really want to spend uh time on your research with uh the archives you should uh try to find out whether you have the  patience and you have the uh ability to handle those grassy uh characters and before i uh i took up my research my supervisor ask me to stay more time with the the archive first before i ' m determined to take up my research uh she fear that i may not be impatient with those words  for each case the testimonies would be laid before the directors for discussion at a committee meeting these meetings were held every night some directors attended the committee meeting particularly on sundays while some others every night  if the directors believe that certain persons had cruelly treated their own muih jai or were kidnappers they would suggest prosecutions to the sca with the sca ' s consent the defendants would be delivered to the sca ' s office which did had the authority to send them to court for prosecutions but as far as the girl was concerned a number of complicated procedures and considerations leading to the settlement of the girl must be undergone  certain procedures were specially tailored to confirm  identities and fight impersonation methods were also devise to check further abuses against their words family reunion adoption marriage or restoration to masters may be arranged to the girls all the discussions involved would be recorded as minutes forming  ji sih luhk  the third item  records of events that means they are the minutes of those discussions among uh the directors  the resolutions would be submitted to the sca as suggestions for the disposal of the girls  with the approval of the sca those suggestions could be carried out the correspondence between the po leung kuk and the sca were compiled as uh the fourth one correspondence from or to the registrar general and after and and in s nineteen thirteen uh the registrar general was renamed as uh secretary for chinese affairs
