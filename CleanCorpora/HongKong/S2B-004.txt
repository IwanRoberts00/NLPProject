his message is delivered in the banners all over the factory

re-elected as foreign minister he had only eight votes against him
drawing spontaneous applause as the ballots were announced

 zheng chi zhen  also had a negligible thirteen no votes and

gaining on the world  ' s diplomatic stage  owing to the astute performance

the other vice premiers voted in today were incumbents  zhu

wilfred wong has served the government for more than a decade

he would not say whether becoming beijing  ' s advisor means he has
defected to the chinese side

but my focus would probably be uh based on uh my past experiences

sze to wah sees the new appointment as china  ' s tactic to isolate
the governor and liberal factions in hong kong 
""
that view is shared by andrew wong
""
""
""
i would say that this is basically uh an united front tactic
uh uh under circumstances that uh china and britain are more or less at war
""
i mean if not uh actual war at least a war of words
""
but uh on the other hand i think such a high gesture high profile
move uh might antagonize the hong kong people and that uh uh hong kong people
might feel that uh beijing is trying to interfere too much into the running
of local affairs
""
""
others are disappointed by china  ' s choice
""
""
they still limit uh their appointment to those people who are
stand or for or favor to their point of view
 
""
as  leading point  one of the liberal group cannot
maintain our communication uh channel with the chinese government 
""
""
four conservative legislators of the to be formed liberal
party have been included in china  ' s list
""
the party  ' s selina chow welcomes the invitations
 it is of course a very good thing during this uh very early stage of the
uh development of the liberal party
""
it does reflect one thing and that is that we do have members in
our midst who are already very actively participating in hong kong affairs in
one capacity or another
""
""
joseph cheng a former advisor to the governor says the
appointment is a typical tactic of the chinese propaganda machine
""
""
the  emphasis on  leading business leaders and
professional leaders are are uh is obviously a good thing
""
and there will be a pretty good balance with uh with the uhm the
 1-word  within the pro-beijing camp
""
on the other hand it is difficult to expect this group to uh to be
interested in a  faster pace of development of our representative system
of government
""
""
he believes in china  ' s eyes a prerequisite to become an
advisor is opposition to the governor chris patten
