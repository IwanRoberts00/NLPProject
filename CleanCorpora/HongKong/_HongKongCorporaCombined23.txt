sister is going to law school attending law school   right now and my brother is uhm going to attend business school   next year or so   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm  and you any other plans   uh probably either uh within the next year or early trying to apply to law school  oh going to the law school again   yes  well so many people going to the law school these days i have another cousin whose fami whose family has got another cousin uh have got another cousin who has gone to the law school and is graduating this year he will become a article clerk and that ' s now he is actually in hong kong he ' s in the law school uh in canada and then uh well actually he ' s coming he has returned to write his paper  uhm     yes   well  well if i remember correctly one third of the lawyers are in the united states   one third   really  one third of the lawyers  but i don't know whether it ' s right or not  so  if that is the case then it ' s very difficult to make a living so many lawyers   uh american needs many lawyers  yah probably because we talk so much about human  right there are all sorts of cases to fight  put it here please  you will not stay longer than ne next month thank you   uh probably not uhm   you are tired of the life here   uh yeah i guess so  really   no uhm   well perhaps you should go go back first and come again rather than stay until you feel bored about hong kong   no i  well actually it ' s   well the lifestyle is different from uh from from the states   yah very different  the quiet place is philadelphia in virginia   no philadelphia is in uhm pennsylvania  aw i once went there passing i i went to washington passing  philadelphia    yeah  yup i grew up in   well it must be the place where the revolution start started is that right    yeah   in philadelphia there ' s a bell isn't it  a bell     there ' s a liberty bell yah the revolution didn't start there but it two-words  its historical revolution revolutionary uh one-word   uh it is a place of uh historical background   yes  i remember i went to the hall uh there is a city hall and the bell   yeah the liberty bell and uhm  is there a make making coins   uhm  yes no it wasn't there   is in philadelphia    yeah there ' s a one-word in philadelphia in philadelphia   in philadelphia there is a one-word  in philadelphia   yes   so   uhm yes i i i remember i went to atlantic city and then i cross a junction and one and the road sign one-way go to philadelphia   yeah so  is it near atlantic city   yeah uh hour and a half way  oh ho   and new jersey up so it ' s far within an hour and   when i go to new york i always go to uh the atlantic city for at least once it ' s a resort  it ' s a it ' s a resort for gambling   what for atlantic city uh uh it ' s famous for   isn't it something like macau  uh you go there to gamble  you go there to gamble there are a lot of casinos  am i right   much larger than that   i don't gamble  you don't gamble     you don't gamble   i don't gamble i don't swim     but  uh just take take a stroll down the wo the wo  the wo probably the boardwalk    the boardwalk yes  is that the boardwalk   the boardwalk yeah   you ' ve been there   yes you know a number of times   it ' s a nice place   it ' s a nice place you don't have to uh you don't necessarily have to be a gambler to stay   uh if you are a gambler if you uh if you go there you have lots lots of thing to see     lots of other things shows and   show yeah uh like the shows in the casino are fabulous   uh you want sugar  mr li uh also goes to macau often you ' ve been there right   i ' ve been there a couple of times   but  a couple of times so but he never gambles   what do you do in macau   relax   eat uh walk around uh taking pictures that ' s all uh vicky has a house there    really   uhm my family has a flat there ' s a flat   my wife also has a house there so we we often go there once a month yah i think he goes there more often than i do though i was born in macau   yeah your family live in macau  uh i have got some relatives still in macau and then actually i will be visiting them on the twentieth because uh my aunt has just got a grand daughter so we are going t see the new born baby uhm in april i mean uh on the twenti twentieth i ' m going there the day after tomorrow  saturday   or actually actually i i my family will be going there on saturday to sweep the graves    oh  oh yeah  but i think i will not not be going this time because i will be leaving hong kong on the seventh for taiwan oh   to taiwan  yes   are you scared uh no  well i ' ve paid my deposit   there ' ll a few words  i ' ve paid my deposited already so i i ' ve got to go  and i believe in my luck   the drill the drill has stopped yeah i i believe in my good luck it should be okay i ' m taking the singapore airline   yeah that should be okay  is it a five-day trip or seven-day trip   ah it claimed that it it should be a five-day trip but then i leave late uh huh on sunday five thirty we ' ll be meeting at the airport at five thirty and the plane will leave at around eight pm uh huh and then uh we ' ll arrive well we ' ll return   have you got friend to show you round  during the rest of the day   no no no  no no no i i ' m join joining a trip  no  uh huh well actually i think it ' s still worth the price uh though there are actually three days uhm because i only paid about three thousand hong kong dollars and then according to the the schedule i should be going up to this alishan  that ' s a nice place   the the the h mountain the famous mountain in taiwan   the highest mountain in taiwan   taiwan  yes so i think it ' s still worth the price if i have to go there arrange the whole thing on my uh on my own then i have to pay a accommodation the flight and then i still have to make arrangement for the transport and that will be very troublesome so i think it ' s still worth three thousand even though  i only have three days holiday    yeah   sure  ah are you doing to stay behind in taipei i want to but it was too late that i discover that uhm my plane leave early so they say that i cannot uh postpone the return date well when when do you resume duty on monday   on the  no no no on the sixteenth sixteenth   on the sixteenth yah but uh the uh actually when i return here i still have other things to do  i ' m a marker for the examination  and i have to a lot of markings for the exmina examination scripts so i think it may be a good thing too that i returned early  uh huh   huh huh huh   yeah  nah vicky is an expert in the teaching of english as a second language   no no no no no no no no no no i ' m supposed to be an expert but not an expert  an expert  well how do you find our english different you from the states   yeah it ' s different the whole grammar structure is wrong yeah   even the grammar structure    even even the news itself   i hope i hope my english not chinglish chinglish   i don't think   chinglish is a combination of chinese and english   yup i think they they teach i i don't know uh just watching and listening to the english news even even the the anchorman on the news speaks in improper english i think  uh   they speak uh uh a di different grammar structure you know   ah   aren't they suppose to be reading from the news script   yeah  so the one who rob wrote write the script has problem but   usually they employ foreigners to do the script writing    yeah  uh some of them but they they speak a i think they they just they are reading up the teleprompter and the cue cards but the writers are speaking uh are writing in improper english or english that is easier for hong kong people to understand   uhm uhm  uh huh   they leave out a lot of articles or the instead of a an  uhm   preposition and articles they leave out a lot of times  uhm uhm   it ' s hard it it ' s not hard to understand but sometimes it ' s it ' s annoying not lis listening to the improper english especially in the news so  so what about the english programme then are the english programme okay i mean those from uh england the  uk ' s production     the english uhm  their the english uhm that that from england is  grammatically the same yah   better  grammatical the same as yours   yes it ' s american english   wow that ' s that ' s our pr big problem that   well i have a cousin always complaining about the british english   really well anyway  he said it is so different from ours   yeah  american   yah uhm i think it ' s more the accent rather than  the actual   the accent   usually the accent may be   yeah  uhm uhm the accent is different so what about the hong kong uh news reporters accent uh do they use the english accent or the american accent    their  i think is more the american accent  american   yeah  oh i ' m ashamed to say that i cannot un  i can't understand a word of my uh cousins when they converse uh they when i when i go to new york uh my brothers-in-law ' s sons and daughters they they converse very quickly use using the things i i   i don't understand    they   yeah  yeah do they have  it it seems to me that uh what they are talking about are they using slangs i don't know   they probably are  uh uh uh i think they have their vocabulary they have their language structure what i i can't catch a  word actually   yah   are they young people young people or adults    yeah  uhm  yeah may be may may be they have their vocabulary uh the the uh i ' m not familiar with uh because yours is the standard one     and  no theirs are the col colloquial one what is your major in the university   uhm my major was uh political science and uh us history   uh political science  uh huh   i had two majors  uh huh second year   i have graduated   uh  graduated   i graduated last may  what is the usual age uh for graduation for the uh young people   uhm it ' s either twenty-one or twenty-two    twenty-one   twenty-one or twenty-two   yeah  uhm   or twenty-three  uh uh   some where in that range it depends  you play sports when you were in the university   no not really i was not really little basketball  uhm uhm   little golf two-words  well uh so how do you spend your time you spend mo most of your time study   uh no not really  so   uhm just uh  dating girls   no uhm just uh going out with friends  uh huh   that ' s is  going out with friends where to then you you must have some activities together   uh not really uh
