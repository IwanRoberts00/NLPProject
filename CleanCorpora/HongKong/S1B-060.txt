<I>
 mr deputy president i thank the governor for his speech 
 in particular i welcome his statements on the future of the legco
 hong kong is indeed entering a crucial time and we at legco have
a vital contribution to make 
 this contribution can best be made in a spirit of co-operation a
will to work together openly and honestly to achieve consensus 
 for the first time in the history of hong kong directly elected
representatives of the people are able to participate fully in the work
of this council 
 i hope that we legco members can demonstrate to the people of hong
kong the prc government and indeed the whole world by the work that we do
in the next four years that we can make a success of democratic reforms
 and that further gradual changes in this direction are beneficial to
the future of hong kong and china 
 let us win the recognition of the prc government by our actions
 i ' m glad to hear the governor say that the work of the jlg will be
speeded up and that it is expected the function in the coming year with a
new impetus and sense of purpose 
 i understand that there remain many outstanding issues which need to
be resolved in the remaining period of the run-up to nineteen ninety-seven
 i trust that the spirit of co-operation prevails there too 
 what is needed is a situation where each side explain its own
views and listens to the views of the other side with tolerance and
understanding
 i firmly believe that the key to success in the talks within the
jlg is the willingness on both sides to work together towards a
convergence of ideas 
 whilst i ' m assured by the governor ' s statement on the progress of
the talks i have some concerns that the views of the people of hong kong
have not always been fully taken into account 
 i appreciate the fact that under the terms of the jlg the general
public including this council would not be consulted formally on its
deliberations 
 however i sincerely hope that the government will give us an
assurance that the interests and concerns of the people of hong kong 
are fully taken into account on all matters discussed 
 i am disappointed with the handling of the matter of the court of
final appeal and hope that in future the jlg will be able to demonstrate
through its actions that it has indeed taken full account of the views of
the hong kong people 
 i should like to talk for a moment about the economy 
 let us never lose sight of the fact that our future depends upon it
 it is absolutely fundamental to the future success of hong kong 
that we continue to have a dynamic economy 
 in the context of the one country two systems promised by china 
we must recognise that it is vital for hong kong to play a pivotal role in
the economy of china 
 this will only be possible if we can sustain well beyond nineteen
ninety-seven the entrepreneurial spirit of the hong kong people which has
brought us such great success up to now 
 if we fail in this task i fear that the rationale for hong kong
being able to operate a capitalistic system within a socialist country 
will be difficult to sustain 
 for this reason i believe that the economy must take precedence
in any changes to our society 
 further i agree with the governor ' s statement that increased
funding for social services welfare and education can only come from
further economic growth 
 accordingly we must work together to promote the continued growth
of our economy for this will ultimately lead to the enrichment of our
society as a whole 
 a major concern about the well-being of our economy in the
short to medium term is the threat to china ' s most favoured nation status
vis-a-vis the united states of america 
 withdrawal by the usa of china ' s status would be extremely
damaging to hong kong 
 in order to protect our own interests we must exert our best
efforts to facilitate the resolution of any problems and to remove any
obstacles which could endanger china ' s mfn status 
 hong kong is now planning what is arguably the most ambitious plan
of development ever seen anywhere in the world 
 construction of the new port and airport are vital to our future
prosperity 
 quite apart from the additional inflationary pressures that these
enormous projects will generate we simply do not have a workforce large
enough to cope with them within the time scale envisaged in the government ' s
plan 
 the importation of labour is a contentious issue but i believe
that further extension of selected importation of labour under a carefully
control scheme will not be detrimental to the interests of our local
workers and will be in the overall interest of the people of hong kong 
 we need the development to facilitate our economic growth and we
need additional labour to undertake these massive construction works 
 if we cannot provide that additional labour from our existing
resources the fact is that we shall have no option but to import it 
 inflation continues to be a serious problem 
 although the recent statistics show a moderate fall in a rate of
inflation it is still running at more than double the rate of most of our
trading partners 
 whilst others appear to be dealing with it with this problem we
clearly are not 
 hong kong cannot tolerate this imbalance for long 
 whist inflation is obviously of particular concern to the less
well-off in our society it is also very damaging for our economy 
 our competitiveness will be seriously eroded if we are not able
to move quickly back into step with our competitors our customers and
the rest of the world 
 yesterday i he listened with interest to many comments
from my honourable colleagues about their assessment of the causes of
inflation in hong kong 
 i ' m sure some of these are correct 
 i welcome the setting up of a task force to identify the causes
of inflation and find remedies for it 
 i urge government to take drastic action to deal with this problem
urgently 
 i anticipate that such action may well be unpalatable to certain
sectors of our society 
 therefore i hope that this council will be fully consulted 
before the chosen remedies are implemented 
 apart from the well-being of our economy the one issue that will
best guarantee our future is the preservation of law and order 
 these two issues are not unrelated as i believe that any
deterioration in our economy will lead to a corresponding deterioration
in the state of law and order 
 i welcome the governor ' s assurance that he will not let standard
slip but i would like to hear more concrete information about how exactly
the government plan to ensure this 
 in particular i would like to know what contingency plans the
government has made in the event of any deterioration in the economy 
 the recent surge of armed robberies is worrying particularly
when the state of our economy is still fairly healthy
 what would the situation be if we have a depression with high
levels of unemployment and a bleak economic outlook 
 i understand the need to curb public spending in order to finance
our pubic infrastructure projects 
 however i would like government ' s assurance that adequate
resources will be made available to the law enforcement agencies so
that they can not merely maintain but actually improve upon the
present state of the preservation of law and order 
 finally i return to the point i made at the beginning 
 the way forward is through goodwill and co-operation 
 this council will only be able to inspire confidence in the people
of hong kong if it is seen by them to act with integrity 
 with these remarks i support the motion several-speeches 
 mr deputy president i would like to join the chief secretary
in thanking all members who have spoken on those subjects for which i am
responsible 
 i will however confine my remarks to the joint liaison group 
the court of final appeal and electoral and constitutional development
 as the governor has highlighted in his address to this council on
ninth october nineteen ninety-one the management of our relations with
china is crucial to achieving a smooth and successful transfer of
sovereignty in nineteen ninety-seven 
 that more than half of the members of this council spoke on
this theme attests to the clear recognition of its importance now and in
the next six years 
 i ' m happy that with my recent appointment as the secretary for
constitutional affairs i shall be able to contribute to this worthwhile goal
 hong kong is a pluralistic society 
 it is entirely natural that different people have different views
 and express their own views forcefully on some on something
so important to our future as how to manage that relationship with our
future sovereign power 
 but i cannot help noticing both from members ' speeches as well
as from public and media comments they generated a broad consensus 
namely that relationship must be base on mutual understanding and
co-operation grounded on the provisions of the joint declaration 
 the prime minister ' s recent visit to china and the signing of
the memorandum of understanding on the airport underscores the key points
of that relationship intensification of co-operation and consultation 
and reaffirmation of the determination to implement the joint declaration 
in letter and spirit 
 surely no lasting relationship can be founded on mutual
suspicion and distrust 
 if they exist then we must do all we can to break them down 
 we must take care to explain our views tactfully and fi 
but firmly 
 at the same time we must listen to the other side with
understanding and patience 
 the stakes are too high for us to do otherwise 
 the joint liaison group plays a key role in our consultation with
china on the implementation of the joint declaration 
 yet i fear that its role is sometimes misunderstood 
 in the words of the joint declaration it is and i quote 
an organ for liaison and not an organ of power 
 it shall play no part in the administration of hong kong or the
hong kong special administrative region
 nor shall it have any supervisory role over that administration
 
 end of quote 
 there is no question of the jlg being a sino-british condominium
government 
 the administration of hong kong is firmly in the hands of the hong
kong government 
 it has sometimes been alleged that britain and china have concluded
agreements on hong kong ' s future in the joint liaison group behind our backs
 this is patently untrue 
 hong kong has a direct line to these consultations both through
its hong kong membership in the joint liaison group and through the executive
council 
 the executive council is fully consulted on the preparation of the
british side ' s objective and at every stage of the discussions 
 the governor ' s recent appointments to the executive council 
should be seen in this context 
 in making his new appointments the governor was anxious to
strengthen the links between the executive and the legislative councils 
 all of his new appointees are members of this council 
 all will play their part in representing the views of the hong
kong people on vital issues affecting hong kong ' s future 
 it is perhaps appropriate at this stage that i refer to the
concerns raised by members of this council both before and during this debate
 on the court of final appeal 
 we are conscious of the strong views express so far 
 there is unders this is understandable because the
continuation of an independent judicial system is one of the mo 
of the important safeguards for the future 
 but i think we now need to stand back a little and reflect 
 public comments have so far focussed on the composition of the
court 
 this is unfortunate 
 the composition of the court is only one aspect of a highly
valuable agreement 
 we have sought in discussions with china to achieve maximum
continuity of an independent judicial system including the vesting of
the power of final judgement in hong kong across nineteen ninety-seven 
 this is of vital importance for confidence for the people of
hong kong no less than for the business community 
 the agreement reached in the jlg enables us now to proceed with
the legislative administrative and practical arrangements for
establishing the court of final appeal 
 it has thus secured for us the key objective of having the court up
and running well before nineteen ninety-seven so that it can have maximum
opportunity to gain experience and establish its reputation and authority
 furthermore if the court we established is to give confidence for
the future there must be no room for doubt that it will be able to
continue after nineteen ninety-seven 
 we must not lose sight of that 
 i should also say that the establishment of the court of final
appeal is a complex matter involving the en enactment of
legislation both in hong kong and in the united kingdom 
 while we aim to establish the court early we are still some
way off being in a position to introduce the necessary bill into this council
 and finalise the practical arrangements 
 more work is being done on it 
 and we are acutely aware of the need for there to be
sufficient safeguards on the independence and prestige of the court 
 we will in due course share our ideas with members of this council
and representatives of the legal profession 
 but there is at least one lesson to be learned from experience in
the past few weeks 
 there is clearly a need to find some means of enabling members
to understand better and earlier what goes into propositions to
be put to this council for the enactment of law or the voting of funds
necessary to put into effect agreements reached in the joint liaison group
 in exploring such means we must of course respect the provisions
in the joint declaration that proceedings of the jlg shall remain
confidential unless otherwise agreed between the two sides 
 i also firmly believe that the first duty to explain such matters
to this council rests with the hong kong government
 after all they are proposals to which we have given our
agreement 
 it behoves us to justify them 
 nineteen ninety-one has witnessed the successful elections to
the district boards and municipal councils culminating in the first
direct election to this council on fifteenth september
