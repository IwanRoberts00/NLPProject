""
""
not over yet yeah
 
""
oh 
""
do you have do you have some other uhm works

other person
""

person 
""

""
""
sorry i don't understand
 
""
no i mean after these these they have uh another  conversation
to talk to the other person like that
""
you  speech inaudible  
""
""
oh i have a i have already uh recorded     
conversation  with the other guy
 
""
 yeah  
""
uh he  ' s a  gwai lo   cantonese=foreigner 
 s 
""
these are the    gwai lo  s
""
an  american or uh 
""
""
 yeah uhm  tut   
""
uh i for  i forget the thing he wrote on this form but uhm 
but  he  ' s a native  s   native speaker but native english
speaker   but uhm  he  he  ' s a hong kong per  person i think
  
""
yeah 
 
""
 aw  five words   
""
 oh he  ' s a   chinese guy 
""
""
yeah     but he studied  in  america
 
""
 oh  
""
ah he can speak  great  english i think 
""
he can speak well english   and  i think different 
because the philippines english and american english have the similarities
compared  to uk 
""
""
 yeah  
""
uhm
 
""
they have different accent     different
languages different    two words  
""
uh where  ' s that the 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
even within  america     there  ' s different kind
of accent i think
 
""
 yeah  
""
yeah yeah they have but usually   uhm  
""
""
 because   you know when i saw the movie  
  the different accent spoken by even the same  tut   
the same  american
 
""
 aw  
""
 no  
""
maybe they are not americans only they are  k  uh they  ' re
the features of the  one word 
""
they have the same country maybe not  in americans because in
american if within  amer  within us they have  the same
accent
""
they they their english is are the same unlike uh the   tut
 the  re  related nations they have different language and very
different accent   they  were using 
""
""
 uhm   
""
""
""
it  ' s true you know  needs some confidence from the
superstition
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
and she once goes to the  uhm   tut  a fortune
teller    in  jordan somewhere i don't know quite  inaudible
speech 
""
and i go with her  and  and my friends uhm asked me whether
i would like to do you know  this sort of thing but
""
i don't want to but you you can ask them questions   sh 
she told me
 
""
 uh huh  
""
uh huh 
""
""
uhm
""
then uh i and then  then the fortune teller asked me uh the the
date  uhm and the time when i was born    and  i told him and
 and he check  many books from many books and  and finally uh uhm
 he told me that uh you got a sister uh  who uh whose  uh  uh 
hum 
 
""
 uh huh  
""
 three words  
""
""
uh how old and my my father and my mother and it  ' s all
correct
 
""
really 
""
""
yes
 
""
so it scared you 
""
""
yes 
""
yeah and i have to pay five hundred dollars  and i and and i
and asked him my friends said it  it you know  i i was  uh there was
no need for me to pay but  but it turn  out  you know different
thing
""
yeah i think it  ' s a  tut  very bad guy
""
the fortune teller is a very bad guy
""
because uhm my friend   when my friend 
 
""
 you didn't have  one word   
""
i don't understand
""
you didn't have to pay but you paid him 
""
""
of course my friend told me  i need not pay but  
the  fortune teller
""
because uh  the first time she came the fortune teller uh just
asked him uhm you can ask some questions before we started 
""
if you don't satisfy with the answer you can go
 
""
 why  
""
  uh  uh 
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
so then you decided to pay  him  one word 
you were satisfied  
""
""
 because he looks like   a triad society member
""
yeah
 
""
a triad   because  he looks like a triad 
""
""
 yeah  
""
yeah yeah so you know we are just three girls
""
yeah uh 
""
yeah you know yeah
 
""
so did you ask him any questions 
""
""
no of course
""
because actually at that time i want to leave and  you know he
stopped me and say you have to pay five hundred dollars  a pause 
 
""
so how do you think he knew  about your  family 
""
""
i think it  ' s from the books not from his own wisdom 
""
and  yeah
 
""
what
""
did he look up the telephone book or what  laughs  
""
""
no uhm  tut  i can't remember but just some you know
 many chinese character and  and there are some  you know 
""
i  ' m not sure but  just many books here  over his desk and
she  he just look over and then he can tell you yeah 
""
  your family  members
 
""
 so did you think  
""
but did he do that by looking up 
""
""
yes   yes 
 
""
 you   know like a census book  or maybe looking up
  your address and telephone number birthday  three words
 
""
i mean you know  from his mind 
""
""
 ah i like a  one word   i think it  ' s
like a census book  
""
i  ' m sure it  ' s from the book
 
""
oh 
""
""
everybody can do it after you know  study for you know 
maybe you major in   you know 
 
""
 uh huh  
""
statistics 
""
""
yeah
 
""
so it  ' s good that you paid him cos he probably knows where you
live 
""
""
what what
 
""
i say it  ' s good that you paid him five hundred dollars because
he probably knows where you live    and come and stop you  
""
""
 but i think it  ' s you know   it  ' s it  ' s  ri
 
""
it  ' s actually uhm  yeah i i think it  ' s quite interesting 
""
yeah because it
 
""
why does you friend go 
""
""
why did my friend goes
 
""
huh huh 
""
""
because it  ' s you know she  ' s very  superstitious 
woman
 
""
so does she still go to see this guy 
""
""
no  after that affair yeah
 
""
and how long has she been going before that 
""
""
sorry
 
""
did she go there  a lot before  she brought   you
 
""
""
 no   no no no no no
 
""
that was the first time for both of you 
""
""
yeah
 
""
i went to the psychic fair this weekend 
""
do you know about the psychic fair  in the convention centre
""
""
yeah
""
they had uhm hong kong psychic fair  this past weekend 
""
""
no i don't know
 
""
and they have a bunch of fortune tellers 
""
""
really
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
and it  ' s free
 
""
uh it  ' s twenty dollars to go there 
""
""
uh the entrance free
 
""
it  ' s the entrance fee and then you have  a a session
""
each session was fifteen minutes   and it  ' s  one
word  dollars  
""
""
 is they move from the uhm   temple street
 
""
maybe 
$a laughs 
""
i don't know 
""
""
is they old or very young 
$z tuts  because   do the bad fortune teller 
 
""
 they were old and   young
""
there were white and chinese and there were  people who did
acupressure massage
""
there were people who did reflexology
""
you know what that is
""
feet  you know    foot massage  
""
""
 oh i see
""
have   you tried
 
""
uh i had an acupressure massage but my friend had a fortune
teller 
""
""
ah
""
not you 
 
""
no 
""
""
uhm
 
""
although we walked around there was uhm  probably about 
thirty  fortune tellers   so we  walking around trying to find
somebody that we liked 
""
""
 one word  
""
oh
 
""
and  there was one man that i saw that i thought  i like
him a lot 
""
""
because he looked a fortune teller
 
""
yeah i can just look for a    one word 
""
""
he just looked good
""
because he was pretty old and  there  ' s nothing  specially
uhm   one words  noticeable about him but i just got a
feeling for him 
""
""
 good design  
""
uhm uhm
 
""
but then i decided i didn't want to do it 
$a laughs  right    three words   
""
""
 and your friend   do it
 
""
i am getting a massage
""
  but  then when i went up to the table  
  to pay for the massage there  ' s little slips    
right we have to fill out your booth number  and the person  ' s name 
and when i got up   there  
""
""
 oh  
""
 oh  
""
 uhm  
""
 have   your mother told me that  that don't
don't let  anybody you know uh to know the  date and the time when you
were born
""
it  ' s very dangerous
 
""
really 
""
""
yeah
 
""
why  one word  i mean i just want to get a
massage that  ' s it 
""
""
yeah
 
""
so but uh on the slip  there was already they had already
written  something i guess    and they three words  
""
""
 uhm  why do you   have to write down this be
if you are   doing a  massage
 
""
 cos you  
""
no no
""
you paid for a table and they give a slip and then you give that
 to the person at the booth  right
""
so  they have the slip and it wasn't blank
""
someone has already written on it and then they crossed it out
  
""
i  guess you know they have decided not to  or they made a
mistake or something but the person  ' s name on the slip was that guy  that
i was interested in having my fortune told
""
and his name was crossed out and they put in  you know my
massage session
""
so  i thought that was kind of interesting 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
 
""
uhm s  tut  o have you gone to any other fortune tellers
""
""
""
no
""
i don't  '  believe in  such
 
""
you don't believe in it 
""
""
yeah
 
""
i sort of find it kind of interesting
""
but  when you go get your fortune told you always ask people
about  the future 
""
""
yeah marriage and
 
""
like you know all your  yeah my  relationship blah blah
blah blah 
""
""
uhm
 
""
what  ' s gonna happen
""
will i be successful
""
but i have always thought  that  if i  went to talk to
a fortune teller and ask him about the past  what would you ask them 
""
""
i never think about it  and  you believe in past
 
""
well yeah
""
i mean if you think about uhm  these things that we are
talking about  like abbas  '  class     around benjamin 
""
""
 if you  
""
is that if you  believe in past then there must be a recycle
you know 
""
  then your  future will become another person you just
going on and on and on
 
""
  two words   
""
well i mean think about this 
""
""
i don't  '  mind if i am going on and on but i  ' m afraid that
one day i will stop you know
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
the whole kat has disappear   and  it is really
terrible
 
""
 huh huh  
""
uhm 
""
uhm  tut  cos you know this is kind of interesting because
 think about benjamin  one word  all the benjamin that
we  ' ve been reading
""
about history images right 
""
i mean  when you i mean you know you what you are asking
fortune tellers    one word   
""
""
why is not pronounced as benjamin
""
i got a friend
 
""
in german it  ' s benjamin  but in  ameri  in england in
american english it  ' s a benjamin 
""
""
uhm
 
""
but german it  ' s  one word  
""
""
 one word 
 
""
 one word     with  like a y
 laughs  
""
uhm  tut  what was i thinking uhm 
""
cos when you go to fortune teller you are saying  oh will i be
happy     really in the future  right
""
and how is happiness gauged
""
will i be marrying or what along the road  one word
  and i mean blah blah blah blah
""
but also happiness is a lot is is gauged on  your feelings of
happiness right  one word  and happy childhood
""
people treated you well  you know and and  of course the
past is constantly changing     so that  ' s the thing that can
be kind of interesting to ask a fortune teller  about the past  
instead of the future  
""
""
 ben yao min oh  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah i have  
""
yeah
 
""
would i be happy in the past 
""
""
usually i think the people will ask uh  what were i 
what was i when i  ' m in the past yeah
 
""
so what were you in the past 
""
""
i think an uh  ki  very  nice person because i
think  uh everybody lives in hong kong is very lucky  because it  ' s 
you know you can
""
it  ' s  to certain extent it  ' s quite fair because you can get
  tut  what you want if you you know you really devoted to do it
 one word   a pause 
 
""
and  one word  you can get what you want 
and what is that
""
can you explain a little 
""
""
uhm  at least if you try hard  a long pause 
 
""
uh huh 
""
you were saying earlier about uhm   tut   what  ' s
that  you can't let people know your birthday
""
it  ' s dangerous
""
why 
""
""
not birthday the time  the time when you were born
 
""
the time   why  
""
""
 yeah  
""
i don't know but my mother
""
because you know in thailand  there  ' s some you know i don't
know the name of the maybe some witch or     and they use the
time and then  one word  
$z laughs 
""
i don't  what they are saying to the maybe some wood wooden
thing or and then you  maybe  uhm and then  certain harm to your
health and or or  break up the relationship or  with your  some
somebody and 
""
have you heard about it
 
""
 uh huh  
""
when you have when they know the time of your birth 
""
""
yeah    and  two words  
 
""
 no i mean i  ' ve heard about   voodoo where they 
they collect other things like piece of your hair   or something like
that  
""
""
 yeah yeah yeah yeah   yeah
""
similar
 
""
ha  so uhm  i want  one word   hear
more about why you think hong kong  you are so lucky to be in hong kong
""
""
""
because i think uhm  uhm there  ' s you know  s 
shopping center
 
""
huh huh 
""
""
instead of it uhm you can 
""
i think it  ' s  uhm many thing are  accessible
 
""
uh huh
""
what else besides shopping 
$a laughs  
""
""
maybe you can you can uhm have you can have many different cd
from different worlds
 
""
many different cities   from  different worlds
""
i don't understand 
""
""
 yeah  
""
from different parts of the world  a pause 
 
""
cds 
""
""
yeah compact disc yeah
 
""
huh huh   so  do you shop all the time 
""
""
 and  
""
do you what
 
""
huh 
""
""
sorry
 
""
i say are you do you shop all the time 
""
""
yes i think so
""
yeah
""
  if  you you do shop you can get anything
""
of course you you at least you  you know first condition you
have money and then you shop or else you got nothing
 
""
 so  
""
but what if you don't have money 
""
""
i still shop but it  ' s very painful shop 
$z laughs 
 
""
but how can you shop if you don't have money 
""
""
uh maybe i will not go to the one that is  that i think
there  ' s not a  good things or   beautiful  things in it
""
  i would  rather go to some you know  cd shop you
know to listen to them cd or and
 
""
 uh huh  
""
 uh huh   
""
uh huh
""
uh huh 
""
""
like tower records
 
""
so do you think shopping is more important than studying or
studying is more important than shopping 
""
""
if you study more than your shopping is much more interesting
because you can see more things yeah
 
""
that  ' s interesting
""
if you study more than you see more when you   shop 
""
""
""
 yeah   because uh it  ' s the experience uh from
the film culture course
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
because after i  take the course in  uh  you know my
uhm
""
every time when i you know saw the movie
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i think it  ' s much more interesting
""
you are not just focusing on the  uhm on the characters but
also the maybe the techniques  maybe your uhm the way the directors use
  and some  other things yeah
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
and then how does it relate to shopping 
""
""
maybe uhm  i can't quote right now but sometimes it just
boom and you  oh and in you think is oh it  ' s related to my study 
sometimes
 
""
can you think of an example 
""
""
no
 
""
oh come on
""
think for it
""
i found it it  ' s very interesting what you say
""
i mean  three words  reading every 
one words  
""
""
who  ' s  one word 
 
""
you read her essay in abbas  '  class 
""
""
really  laughs 
 
""
 fleurs de fleurs du mal  
""
""
uhm
 
""
the postmodernism and  one word  
""
""
i remember the name but i  can't   link them  to
the essay
 
""
 she  ' s talking about   malls 
""
""
the malls
 
""
the malls
""
remember when she says it  ' s like   a  one word
 walking  
""
""
 i i was late in   that lecture
""
  just talk about other  things
 
""
 oh it  ' s terrible  
""
that  ' s terrible 
""
""
you you were never late
""
you were never late in the lecture
 
""
am i ever late
""
not for my own lectures maybe for other people  ' s 
""
""
really
 
""
yeah
""
 two words  says is that there  ' s a certain
experience in the mall right
""
it  ' s and she relates it to the arcades     when
 six words  where you have shoppers who walk around in an
enclosed space  and they consume not only by buying things  right
""
but they consume  visual  visually 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
 
""
 three words  you see as well so you are
consuming through your eyes and that  ' s very much like film
""
and so she relates 
""
""
then what is the benefit of the you know
 
""
well that  ' s the question
""
what is the benefit
""
and you brought up this idea that by studying more you enjoy
shopping more     right
""
so i mean one of the one of the  immediate  response is
that people would say  two words  okay you you do all your
studying   and  then you get a job and you get more money and
then you can go buy things
""
well but you weren't saying that uh oh i study for ten hours and
then i feel like i need to go  relax and so i relax buy shopping
""
but you were saying actually by studying  you know it opens up
  some kind of insight on shopping so i want to hear more about that
 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 of course i  ' m not  i  ' m not studying in   order
to shop
""
of course not   uh   s  uh it  ' s the main point
and  and i think uhm uhm  uhm maybe just talk about other things you
know
""
if i think of it i  ' ll tell you okay
 
""
 okay  
""
okay
""
so uhm what do you want to talk about then 
""
""
is it the first time you come to hong kong
 
""
no
""
i  ' ve been here  i don't know how many times
""
probably at least a dozen times 
""
""
uhm  a pause 
 
""
so talking more than about why you feel so lucky to be in hong
kong
""
are you worried about nineteen ninety-seven 
""
""
yeah i hate chinese because when i   go to shenzhen
""
 
""
 you hate chinese   people 
""
""
yep
""
yeah
 
""
but aren't you chinese 
""
""
yeah
 
""
so do you hate yourself 
""
""
no
""
i think   i  ' m a hong kong 
 
""
 then your logic doesn't make   sense 
""
""
a chinese people in hong kong is different from a chinese
people in china
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
yeah when i go to shenzhen i always you know  uhm  i  ' m
so afraid of the the you the the cops   
""
they  looked terrible
""
they just to me they just looked like some  thieves or some bad
guys
 
""
 the policeman  
""
uh huh 
""
""
they don't give me any security any sense of security yeah
 
""
so why do you go to shenzhen 
""
""
uh to go to the i don't know if the  the name of the 
the  something like uh  uhm  like ocean park just  just you go
there and you play different things and
 
""
uh huh
""
so how many times have you been to shenzhen 
""
""
once
 
""
just once 
""
""
yeah
 
""
and you wouldn't go back 
""
""
i  ' m not sure but i don't want to go back
 
""
have you been to other parts of china 
""
""
yes but i don't remember the name of it because i was 
ignorant at that time because i was very small
 
""
huh huh 
""
""
and i got some close relatives there
 
""
in what part of china 
""
""
i don't think to me it  ' s not not close relatives because i
am not familiar with them
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
it  ' s my mother  ' s   f  relatives
 
""
and where are you where  ' s your mother and father from
""

""
""
everybody  s  usually come from guangdong
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
yeah
 
""
uhm   tut 
""
so tell me more about ninety-seven and why you are afraid of the
chinese 
""
""
uhm because they always  hide the truth
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
or not telling the truth
 
""
do you think the british are always telling the truth 
""
""
uhm  i i think at this moment  china uhm i have to
think of more about china than  britain
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and  also i want to work in the media   and i 
think it  ' s in  quite uh you know  uhm  tut  you know uhm 
uhm it  ' s very  pessimistic i think  about the approach of nineteen
ninety-seven
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
so there are a lot of people that are leaving hong kong  right
""
the people who are getting citizenship in other  countries
like the us and australia 
""
""
and hong kong is left with poor guys
 
""
great britain  or  what do you think about those people
""
""
""

""
the people   who  are leaving do you think that  ' s
right
