<I>
okay anyway i pre i presume that you ' ve alr 
you ' ve already done this uh reading and anyone here hasn't done it 
you haven't
but anyway i won't be asking you a lot of say difficult questions
just to i mean if you ' ve been attentive to my lecture you ' ll be able to
answer some of my questions here
okay first of all say based on your reading or based on your
understanding of my lectures
i simply would like to find out from you say uhm whether you can
identify some of these circumstances that one will be facing culture shock or
having culture shock problems 
i think you should get rid of your habit of jotting down notes when
you have your discussion here 
i mean what you need to do here is to think what i i ' m asking
instead of say jotting down questions or whatever 
anyone
 they lives a new environment
 yes 
sorry
 live in a new environment
right that mean facing a new environment
it ' s a time where you ' ll be facing culture shock but be more
specific try to identify some of these circumstances or situations about
people who ' ll be facing culture shock a long pause 
yes
 uh you means which people
right
 uh new immigrants
sorry
 new immigrants
yes the immigrant group so what kind of culture shock problems
 do you think they will be having
 uh 
 they may face a they will make some new friends new cul
 culture and new environment a long pause 
you just said they may be facing new friends 
 yes uh but they still or is speaking an
uh uh the other language
yes
 and and uh new culture this uh that is really different from
his own culture a long pause 
why not you simply focus on say having new friends in a new
cultural environment
what sort of problems do they have a long pause 
 you may feel difficult to work
right this is something quite likely to take place that is say
when you are in a new environment like these immigranted people it ' s
likely that they will have that kind of say communication problems 
and mind you don't think that okay supposed now one day you
immigrate since you been educated under this say english medium education you
will be able to communicate well
you will be able to get your message across 
as i said before in my lecture when you are in a fam 
in a an a in an environment which are quite familiar with you may not be able
to detect your own false or own weaknesses
and like now what i ' m talking is your communication skills
okay in lecture or in your seminars you ' ll seem to be able to use
english to talk to me or to talk to a lecturers
but once you are placed in an environment where people will be
speaking english as their mother tongue you find that a kind of verbal
english communication skills that you ' ve acquired here in hong kong may not
work why
can someone explain
 the accent is different
right
if people speaking english and then these people have not exposed
themselves to people speak english as a foreign language or people speak
english as a second language they might not be familiar with the kind of
strange accent that these people have speaking english as a second language
and then once they i mean these these native speakers of english
have encountered with si speakers speaking english as a sec 
second language
they may find so difficult to understand what they are talking
about 
and then it takes you some time to change your own strange accent
which you ' ve got in your own english okay 
i mean i can give you an example like say in hong kong i never
never had any exposure or an encounter with people from other parts of asia
such as say from india from pakistan 
and then when i was in england i talk to these pe i mean i
don't know their language they don't know my language either okay
so that ' s why english is the only lang language that say
people can communicate with one another
and then when i talk to these people i find it so difficult to
understand the english used by people who are from india or from pakistan
so you can imagine in a situation you speak english as a second
language or as a foreign language and then the other person speaks as their
mother tongue
and it it ' s a same they also have to be patience to try to figure
out from the the strange english that we are speaking to find out what the
actual message is
and then i can give you another example that is say a long
pause 
how do you pronounce this word 
uhm how do you say this word
right may be i ' ve mentioned this word to you already yes
i mean it ' s a same it ' s a kind of say example showing to you that
say we ' ve got a very strange accent but this word is not the uhm a
matter of accent
it ' s a matter of mispronunciation which we haven't been able to
realize 
because once you started learning it you just pick up the wrong the
wrong pronunciation and nobody point it out to you in your life
but now you are in another environment and people speaks the
language as their first language 
and if they can't figure out say what your message is then you
probably will try to spell out the word to them
and eventually they find they would tell you that okay you ' ve got
a wrong pronunciation okay
 yes 
 but is it a big problem for those 
 it could be as i mention to you already
i ' ve been repeating the word a couple of times to my professor
he couldn't figure out what what i was talking about until i try to
spell out the word to him 
and i ' m sure that there are quite a number of other examples which
at this moment you won't be fig uh able to detect that you ' ve uh
got the wrong pronunciation or whatever until one day you really have an
encounter and people point it out to you okay 
i mean another example is that say it ' s a a matter of your
intonation 
likes it ' s quite likely that say you probably have been sort of
say having a rising tone all the time in a kind of sentences that you are uhm
talking about in your conversation
but normally it ' s not necessarily that they all you always have
that kind of rising tone 
eventually probably you i mean like you how how do you say this
word 
uhm sorry 
 boy boyfriend
right i mean now you may have got it correct boyfriend
but i i find a say many of people in hong kong speaking english as
a second language they tend to say boyfriend
i ' ve got a boyfriend i ' ve got a girlfriend 
i mean is this a kind of phenomenon in hong kong yes 
and i think before i went to london i i did the same
but after having so much say verbal communication with the locals
there i found that i began from that time onward to change my accent as
well as say pronunciation okay
okay besides communication problems what else that this i mean
immigrant group will be facing a long pause 
 uhm may be lu uh living style is different between
different culture
 for example eating habit
sorry
 for example eating habit may be there 
can you elaborate this eating habit
 uhm may be you uhm now you some a long
pause 
 for a sector an example for example a chinese uh they
like use some uh internal organs to make uh their soup the 
one-word and the foreigner they don't like that
uhm a long pause 
but how would this eating habit lead to culture shock
 uh the the habits uh knowledge they they they know
that uh their their favourite is is uh dirty things uh in the other people ' s
mind
 i think it ' s so shock
 or uh i mean chinese people uh don't meet or 
 one-word uh favourites quite often uhm
 foreigners will quite uh uhm strange the seed house seed
 but i has uh several words also
 speak up please 
 i think in the immigrant feel that the they will
be a sense of alienated and think that they are not accepted by the other
people in this culture
right this is the main point
okay you probable can't have the same kind of food that uh you can
find in a different culture
like say before when you were in hong kong you may eat a lot of all
these uh pig organs which these are english speaking people in america or in
england don't quite like eating okay
and if you simply means the food per say that is the food
itself
okay if you can't find that kind of food you can replace it with
something else
and since you live in uh say in in san francisco or in london you
can eat it if you go to uh chinatown to get a kind of say uh your favourite
chinese food
but of course still it ' s a bit difficult for you to get whole of
this say these are internal organs of pigs or or cows or whatever okay
but the main point is not just missing the food will lead to
culture shock 
like normally say in hong kong you probably will be eating with
your whole family then when you eat you seem to have someone to talk to
even though i in our lecture i said that you may not have say that
kind of verbal communication you may simply communicate with tv only while
you were eating okay
but i ' m sure that say in some families people do have some kind
of verbal communication to improve their relationship while they were eating
okay
but since you are so used to having a group of people eating and
now you are alone may be in a situation as a student
and once you eat you found that you always be alone and this
will sort of say leading you to think of the kind of good time that you have
with your family okay 
that is say sort of say reminding you that you are being lonely
here okay
and this will sort of say bring you into that kind of say
emotional or psychological disorientation making you feel more lonely
okay another point is that okay may be you take a friend out to a
chinese restaurant overseas and then you be ordering this uh chicken feet or
say liver or kidneys
and then when the other person who is not so used to eating
all these organs
and then they ' ve got another interpretation of your your
character 
as i said before people from difficult cultures will have their
own value systems
i mean to them may be say dogs or cats or birds i mean pigeons you
know like in hong kong will i mean say that can say roast pigeon is
the favourite of many people siu yuh gap these cantonese
words refer to roast pigeon okay
in london it ' s impossible that you i mean you sort of say telling
people that we eat pigeons
because to them pigeon is something which ought to be protected
right
because pigeon to them is a a symbol of peace you can't eat them
or say dogs they regard dogs as their friends that ' s why in
the parks you can think you can see the scene
at the weekend a lot of people take their dogs out to the park
they kiss their their dogs right
and then you tell them that say you you eat that kind of say uh
dog meat or organs from that kind of say their their favourite pets
so you can imagine that they could have a misinterpretation of
your character
and in that case this may develop a kind of say uh blockage
blocking you from making friends with another one from a different culture
and what could the result be
and then that that person may refuse to make friends with you
and as a result that means your your alienation will be getting
more serious okay
so i won't be refuting that eating habits could be a kind of
culture shock but you ought to thought it think about it deeper not so
thinking about say missing food 
because normally say wherever you go you ' ll be i mean expecting
that you won't be able to have the same type of food 
but it ' s easily to make adjustment after you ' ve settled
somewhere for little for a while okay 
and then besides this immigrants group say what other groups of
people that you can identify who be facing culture shock a long pause
 overseas students
yes can you identify some of the problems
 they the way they learn in school is different from hong
kong one-word and united states
right i quite agree say on i mean this is something that be
repeating in my lectures that is say as an overseas student and then you are
in a different cultural environment doing your studies
and then you find a say the way uh you learn could be say
different from what you had before and it takes you some time to find out the
expectations of your lecturer
i mean now you may not be able to tell that say whether uh the
expectations of uh lecturer here is high or low
because you got no comparison but as i said just in the
lecture before you come in you ' ll find that say 
since say these people say that these lecturers they speak english
as the as their first language and then they they probably say will
expect a lot from you especially in terms of the use of language okay
and then now if when you are in hong kong you find that your your
assignments have been accepted by all these lecturers they won't be say
pointing out to you that say they can't understand what you mean in your in
your papers
but it may happen that say people who speak english as their first
first language they probably will find out that they will query they may not
be able to understand say some parts of your essays 
and then you might be asked to rewrite it 
and then that will sort of say bring you back to your query in
hong kong about the standard here or the expectations here of your lecturers
 in the poly 
i mean when you suspect this or suspect that you make all sort of
queries that means you are actually in a kind of say psychological imbalance
what else what other problems that say overseas students might be
having a long pause 
 the life style of student himself is different from other
students the local students there
 for example may be students from hong kong even after school
they may go back to their home and do their services 
 however the local students there they prefer some extra activities
like to go uh a basketball watching one-word willing to
watch a basketball match one-word 
yes i think that say this has got something to do with value
system as well
like to many of these uhm english speaking persons they sort of
have uh having make a very clear distinction between work and rest 
may be to them from nine to five is their time for work but after
that no more work just find something that they like
just find something to help them to relax
and it ' s a same to these students who are educated and brought up
in an english speaking environment 
may be after class they will think that okay either i go to do my
part time job to earn money to su to support myself because normally
they are quite say financially independent once they reach say the age of
sixteen 
and to many of the chinese students who study overseas 
they will think that say since they spend so much money their
parents give them so much money to go overseas to study
they must try to get good academic results in order to meet the
expectations of their parents
so instead they might be even though they might be invited to go
to parties but they just feel guilty of not working hard enough 
and as a as a result what would happen uhm
