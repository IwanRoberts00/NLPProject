<I>
now detective you are according to what you ' ve told us
earlier on you said you were handed all the exhibits by bpc eight four
five shortly after the briefing by the inspector cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes 
first of all wou wou would u uhm that be
around about nine nine thirty cantonese translation and answer 
 
i do not quite recall the time cantonese answer 
 
as a matter of procedure he would put all the exhibits down to the
exhibit room and then hand in the receipt 
please refine yourself to uh my questions
what time did you come duty cantonese translation and answer
 
some time after eight
i don't quite recall 
right
and it wouldn't be immediate not on your immediate uh report
back to duty that your were handed the exhibits would you cantonese
translation and answer 
correct cantonese translation and answer 
 
correct 
now i ' m not asking you to be specific but i think uh would
you agree with me that may be uhm you were handed over the exhibits 
before ten o'clock or shortly after ten or what
really doesn't matter you know uh precisely what time you work 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
i cannot be sure because i really can't recall 
fine fine
now when you refer to all the exhibits uhm you what do you mean by
that
the actual exhibits were handed over to you is that it
like item by item ' like ' overlaps cantonese word ' néih', ' you'
in english cantonese translation and answer 
 
i cannot quite recall
it ' s possible that after he had handed in the exhibits he then uh
passed the receipt to me in that case i would still be invite uh having taken
over 
would you have a record to assist your memory on that 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
perhaps uh it may be in the police record o one five five 
so when you said earlier that all the exhibit were passed over
to you by eight four five you might be saying that it could be item by
item or just the exhibit you see or exhibit tag is that it cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes 
now and the exhibit received would that uhm state contain in
it all the items of exhibit refer to cantonese translation and answer
 
yes 
do you know where this exhibit you see just now cantonese
translation and answer 
 
in the case file a long pause 
 
when you take uh the receipt uh the exhibits out did you hand the
receipt in cantonese translation and answer 
 
not necessary
it is just necessary for us to have the inspector signed on a memo
uh ask him for uh retrieval of the exhibits 
you do you know what exhibit were handed over to you 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
at that time i knew but i do not recall now
there were many 
there were many cantonese translation and answer 
 
there were many exhibits 
like what cantonese translation and answer 
 
money cantonese answer 
 
towel cantonese answer 
 
money towel cantonese answer 
 
police notebook 
right unidentified sound 
go on cantonese translation and answer 
 
a knife 
blood sample cantonese translation and answer 
 
that is that is in the exhibit that i cannot recall when those
were received i cannot be sure 
now you are telling us with here that you were actually handed
over the exhibit and not just the exhibit list cantonese translation and
answer 
 
uh not so uhm let me do it again
at that time everyone was working at that time i repeat the case
file together with part of the exhibit
at that time some of them were two-words 
can't you just deal with uh one particular exhibit
now you were aware that insofar as the second defendant is
concerned he was asked to uhm to hand in all his clothing including
his under pant cantonese translation and answer 
 
that ' s right i think he did that 
right to your recollection what happened to his clothing 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
later on i took them to the government laboratory for examination
i see
so you you would have taken also to the government laboratory
uhm the blood sample saliva sample uh that that that type of uhm items is
that right cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
these were uh items that were handed over to you after the uhm
defendant had been medically examined cantonese translation and answer
 
yes 
and and that also included samples from uh madam lam after she
had been medically examined cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
all those items were handed over to the government chemist 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
including the clothings of of the arrested three cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes 
and the under pant of the second d cantonese translation
and answer 
 
yes 
now is that handed over to the government laboratory on the
twentieth fifth of uhm of may last year cantonese translation and
answer 
 
i don't quite recall the exact date 
there were
 
that i took it there 
would appear that there were a a total of sixty one items 
uhm handed over to the government laboratory for examination cantonese
translation and answer 
 
there were too many but i really can't recall the number 
a long pause 
oh just on uh on another point very short one
uh do you know that these the defendant were initially charged
with only one count of robbery cantonese translation and answer 
sorry i two words cantonese
translation 
and only sorry sir
on the twenty fifth of may of nineteen ninety uh the the three of
them were charged with only one count of robbery
and subsequently in july tenth of july uh they were further charged
with the rape and the sexual offences do you know that cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes 
okay two words thank you
officer you also took part in the investigation of the case
against the third defendant did you not cantonese translation and answer
 
yes 
you interviewed the third defendant in the afternoon of twenty
fourth of may last year is that not ' is that not ' overlap cantonese word ' néih', ' you'
in english cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
and never mind about the result of that interview but is it
correct that you never interviewed the elder brother of third defendant
 cantonese translation and answer 
 
right 
and in fact none of your team members of the cid had ever
interviewed the the elder brother of the third defendant is that right 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
on the same day you received the exhibits you also received
the clothings which were being worn by the third defendant when he was
arrested is that right cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
and isn't true that some family members of the third
defendant had to bring some other clothes to the police station to give to
the third defendant for him to wear cantonese translation and answer 
 
i don't know about this 
the third defendant was when he was charged with robbery you
were present is that right cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
there is no further questions thank you
just one
uh a so after you ' ve handed over the exhibit receipt to
dpc one nine two zero zero zero he became the man responsible for the exhibit
is that what you say ' is that what you say ' overlap cantonese
translation haih màih wah cantonese translation and
answer 
 
if i handed the case together with the re receipt with
them i would then be temporarily disconnected with this case 
yes i appreciate that
but since you ' ve handed it over to dpc one nine zero zero zero i ' m
talking about the exhibit so he will be in charge and be responsible 
don't you think so cantonese translation and answer 
 
i had handed in the exhibits to the property office if he had
note of them he could go and find them out from the property office 
with the exhibit receipt cantonese translation and answer
 
he just required uh a memo signed by the oc for the retrieval of
the case 
thank you unidentified speeches 
may i please you my lord
now officer you seized the clothings from the third defendant
 did you not cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
he changed his clothes in front of you did he not 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
he had a new set of clothes brought to the police station had
he not cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
some family members of the third defendant had taken his
clothe to the police station did you know that cantonese translation and
answer 
 
i know 
and what time was it uh when you saw the third defendant
changed his clothes cantonese translation and answer 
 
i cannot recall 
i think you put it down at some time between six twenty five
and six thirty seven in the statement do you remember that cantonese
translation and answer 
 
i received clothing from a number of uh prisoners in a sequence
if you want the time i can refer to 
yes please cantonese translation 
of course the the events were fresh in your memory when you
make the note cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes a long pause 
yes was was i correct about the time cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes 
that would be the twenty six twenty five at six thirty seven
uh of the early morning on the twenty fourth of may of last year 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
the few hours after the third defendant had been taken back
to the police station cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes cantonese translation and answer 
now you also seized uh i think from d three two
hundred and eighty dollar
the third defendant two hundred and eighty dollar cantonese
translation and answer 
 
yes 
and also a key cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes cantonese translation and answer 
and when you seized the key you make an entry of that in your
notebook right cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
and later you made a statement also recording that fact is
that right cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
so there were two records made by you concerning the seizure
of that key from the third defendant cantonese translation 
one in a notebook and then in a subsequent statement you made
on a same day cantonese translation and answer 
 
yes 
isn't it true that when you were making this particular
record concerning the seizure of the key you did not write in either of
those two records whether the key had a rubber band cantonese translation
and answer 
 
right 
okay
so you seized only a key cantonese translation and answer 
 
you may say that 
and you don't remember if the key had a rubber band 
cantonese translation and answer 
 
right 
well the the the key you seized from the third defendant
might not have a rubber band cantonese translation and answer 
you don't remember overlaps with the cantonese answer
 
i cannot be sure 
doctor you told us that some findings of uhm human s s
 s s spermatozoa on one bed sheet
isn't right that you were delivered two bed sheet in total a
long pause 
 
uh can you be more specific about the second one because it might
take me some time to go over the whole lot 
uhm i mean because as our understanding there are two bed
sheets were seized from the scene so i don't know which bed sheet did you
 
okay uhm 
 on which you found
 
i was delivered one which is marked six by the police
allegedly seized from the bed on which as i said on the police
submission form okay on which ap two raped the victim 
 beside 
 
okay i only received one 
yes
 
and that was an item marked eight 
yes
 
and as described in the police submission form it was a bed sheet
seized from the bed on which ap two raped the victim 
i see
and can you tell which from which area of the bed sheet that you
have this hu human spermatozoa
 
well it ' s very difficult to particularly name an area on a bed
sheet because you would understand and i ' d be appreciate that there is no
particular reference but i have made a drawing here uh if you would allow me
okay it is this is the bed sheet as laid out and it ' s on here okay 
yes
 
i mean 
 
yes we can see that 
thank you
now you told us that you cannot determine the source of this
spermatozoa can you tell us the age of it
 
no 
you can't
 
no 
it could have been there for a long time
 
 well 
 before you re-examined it
 
yes it could it could 
it could have been there for a long time
 
yes there is no way of telling the age of a stain 
once the bed sheet is stained the stain stays there un
 unless 
 
 unless it has been washed two words
 
yeah a long pause 
thank you uh doctor 
now of the sixty one items that were sent to you for examination
 only about twelve items had in fact been examined
 
yes uh 
yes twelve 
and you ' ve already told us uh insofar as the clothings
of the three males concerned that had not been examined
you ' ve given a very long reason but do i take it that the
reason why they had not been examined is because it ' s impossible to look for
vaginal secretion on a male clothing as a link
can i summarise your long answer uhm in this way
 
uhm it ' s well first of all it ' s almost impossible okay
i ' m not saying it ' s definitely impossible 
right fine 
 
 it ' s very remote that we can positively identify
or positively uhm individualise se vaginal secretions on uh clothing
items
that ' s why it is not a common practice 
so basically basically the non-examination so to speak is
because uh of of the remote possibility of matching vaginal secretion to to
the male by examining the clothings
 
yes yes 
 is that right
 
 yes 
 is that be fair
<$z1 
that ' s okay i ' ll take that one 
 thank thank you
but uh doctor there are more than one purposes for you the
clothings to be sent over to you for examination
 
meaning 
meaning you know one of the purposes in the examination
is to search for the presence of stains
 
excuse me 
 of hu it ' s all right i repeat it
 
i ' m sor 
 that ' s fine
now one of the purposes of the examination is to search for the
presence of stains of human seminal material or blood on the other item would
you agree
 
 uhm 
yes yes 
so uh by examining the clothings you might be able to
detect presence of stain of human seminal material like sperm
would would would would that be fair to say
 
yes that would
but there again i didn't think that it was relevant
or at the time uhm i have spoken with uh inspector wong of the
who was in charge of the case we didn't think it was valid it would have been
irrelevant that ' s why it wasn't done 
but it would be relevant uh would it not uhm for example let ' s
let ' s be more specific about this
the under pant of uh chinese male law uh that would be of
great significance and relevance bearing in mind the allegation of
sexual intercourse do you agree
 
well in retrospect may be but at the time uhm we didn't o
 we obviously didn't think it would be relevant i mean because we have
had a lot of experience with people those easily explaining away for stains
on their under clothing 
you doctor if you had examined the pair of under pant
of this particular chinese male the chances are you might be able to
detect human seminal material on it
 
yes i ' m not ruling that out
yes that could have been 
in fact in other cases of rape which you were involved as the
forensic scientist the under pant of a suspect would be examined
 
you ' d be surprised no uh not as a rule 
not as a rule
 
no 
uh let ' s move on to another items
now you ' ve uhm included on your list of examination twelve items
already told us blood saliva samples one word 
et cetera
now on forensic scientist ' s view it would appear doctor
that after the after madam lam had been to the doctor and after these three
young men had been to the doctors uhm vaginal swabs and penile swab were
also obtained from these various people do you agree a long pause
 
yes that ' s right 
thank you
now i don't see these items on your list of items that you had
examined
well take it that these items had not been examined will you
 
yes that ' s right 
wouldn't these items be of particular importance in the
examination in the light of this case
 
okay
concerning the vagina ' s uh swabs of the female lam it was her
own allegation that she had bathed herself since the incident uhm
yes and uh there again our experience comes in
it ' s very remotely that uhm we can find anything since bathing
i mean with washing there will be very little chance of semen
left in her vagina 
you would agree with me sure doctor that even though there
had been washing especially if ejaculation was inside uh the vagina
 there is still a chance uh not necessarily a slim chance of detecting 
semen
 
yes there is a slim chance yes 
 all right
and washing really all depends on how thorough the wash might be
 
that ' s true too i mean at the extend of the okay
yes 
 true too 
right and basically the purpose in obtaining the vaginal swabs
from her and that to be handed over to you is for you to examine as you ' ve
set out in the purposes of your examination to search for the presence of
stains of s human seminal material
 
yes that ' s true 
so madam doctor sorry you are basically telling us that that
was overlooked
 
no i have considered it and we thought it wouldn't be relevant
because chances of getting a positive result is very remote
and even if there if we did get any weak response for uh
presence of semen i mean with my experience from my experience anyway chances
of grouping it is so remote that is not worth it 
don't worry about grouping
grouping you ' re actually going or attempting to identify the
source
 
yes 
all right
but one is really talking of the grouping is only one of the
purposes of your examination is that right
 
yes 
the other equally important purpose is of course the presence
to detect presence of such material must be right
 
well uhm i can't say that they are of equally of equal importance
i mean as far as i concern anyway i i i can't i don't see the
matter from the legal point of view as you do but as far as i can see
they are not of equal importance 
what about uhm penile swabs
 
uhm there again 
 did you conduct examinations
 
no because if i am at the as i explained lately earlier on
detection of its vagina ' s secretions even on clothing item is very difficult
i ' m not to say penile swab which is really uh swab are very
localised area
and uh 
you are talking
 
no just hold on please yes 
you are once again talking about linking or grouping 
right
 
establishing a link between the female and male parties is not
the case 
i ' m obviously more concerned about the presence of semen
if you had conducted an examination on the penile swabs 
delivered to you which belonged to uh chinese male law you would or might
be able to detect presence of semen
 
i might unidentified speech but there again the same
goes i mean the same the same reasoning as the uhm as i have 
one-word for the clothing items goals for the penile swabs 
you ' ve told us the meaning of secre a secretor
that is a person would be expected to posses appreciable
quantity of their blood group substance in the other body fluids such as
semen
 
yes 
appreciable quantity you are actually talking about uhm
larger quantity
 
measurable quantities 
 measurable quantity
so is be a lot easier to detect the existence or non-existence
of such substance do it
 
uh easier is a very relative word right 
 so it ' s helpless
 
 easi 
no what okay okay a non-secretor ' s let ' s let me put in this way
okay a non-secretor is almost impossible if you want a comparison then
that ' s what i will say
for non-secretor is is almost well is very very re 
difficult because the substances are just not there for measuring 
right
your honour waste too much work of it 
now basically of the items that you have examined there is only
two strand of hairs that might be attributable at attributable to
chinese male law
 
well only one of the two 
only one of the two
 
yeah 
 nothing very much
and if only that he might only be
 
excuse me i ' m sorry yeah 
one out of three who might have possessed or the donor of
such hair strand of hair
 
yes that ' s true 
so basically you can't link any of these three young men uhm
uh to the victim of this case madam lam
 
no well no not personally 
not through the examination
 
well except for that piece of hair again there ' s no
solid evidence anyway okay 
 except that piece of 
and uh you after you ' ve done your examination there is no
finding of any presence uhm of semen attributable to these three young men
 
no 
thank you a long pause 
sorry unidentified sounds 
yes officer you said you did not examine the penile swabs for
vaginal secretion because chances of finding such secretion would be even
less than chances of finding such secretion on the clothings of the three men
is that not right
that ' s what you said
 
is that what i said 
yes
 
okay 
because you said it it was of a local area therefore chances
were smaller
 
okay uh that would have been said uhm in relation to the under
pants that i mean yah more or less 
i see
 
of whose of the 
 i think uh learned friend there just asked you
why you did not examine the penile swabs and that was the explanation you
gave
 
okay 
perhaps so
why wasn't the penile swabs examined
 
because uhm like i explained for s the vagi 
uh difficulties with vaginal secretions it is very difficult firstly to 
conclu conclusively say that there is vaginal secretion and secondly
took individualised vaginal secretion is almost impossible 
i see
so the whole purpose of of seizing the clothing sending the
swabs to you would would have been useless because you would say in
normal situation almost impossible to have any examination on these items to
prove whatever you want to prove
 
okay
the clothings were sent the clothing items were sent with a note
saying that uhm there was uh a request for examine uh for establishing
contact evidence between the ap of the males and the female
party
and of course clothing items sent to the lab could have been done
for that purpose
not necessarily only for identifying body fluids 
 uhm uhm 
yes besides that doctor and in fact despite all these items
being sent to the lab you haven't even establish contact evidence from these
items
there is no contact evidence whatsoever
 
i ' m not sure about that because contact evidence could be in the
form of fibre transfer and that is not not that is not what i do in the lab
