<I>
we had too much uh conversation related to work lately so
that we cut we cut them both laugh 
so won't you start
how ' s your weekend
 
yeah okay
let ' s start talk talk about the weekend two
words 
on saturday night uh there was a a person leaving hong kong
and she had a party at a restaurant called the casa mexicana 
uhm 
 yes 
 is that mexican
 
yeah
mexican restaurant yeah 
where where ' s that
is it in north point
 
 uhm 
it ' s near
the nearest s station is fortress hill on
the island 
 fortress
oh yes that ' s right 
that ' s uh that ' s uh what i call north point laughs 
 in a very rough sense 
 
 yes that ' s right
yeah 
but if you get off at north point you 
 what have you got here
 
if you get off at north point you you end up in a
wrong part of town to get to the restaurant one-word 
uh it is quite difficult to find 
 it ' s okay 
is it
uhm
 
but uh 
sorry westson estate
is it somewhere near es westson estate
 
yeah 
yeah
how was the food
oh this this is this the only mexican restaurant in town
 
i think there are now two or three 
 there is always 
was it
i was thinking about people going there
 
because there were there were two
it ' s actually two restaurants
one side is mexican the other side is a is an american texas
 rib place 
 uhm uhm
that ' s right
yes yes yeah
 
and i ' ve never been before 
uhm
 
but uh i was quite impressed actually 
 uhm 
why is that
 
because uh i was thinking uh maybe we could do it some
time for uhm for a library senior staff party
i know that the food might not go down very well 
with my colleagues but uh it ' s such fun 
 yes 
 uhm 
it ' s quite far away is it
 
yeah 
but you can take the mtr
 
well it took took us an hour to get there from 
the new territories 
 oh 
oh of course if you are in the two-words
 
 
 two-words 
it ' s not too 
one once you get down to central and get on a train it ' s not too
bad 
 yeah 
uhm really
 
 two cantonese words 
our s area of activity has not extended 
further than causeway bay
 
really both laugh 
yeah i mean we ' re more cons or confined it to 
the central district a pause 
 
well 
yeah
 
once once you get there the the gen generally the 
everybody seems to know that you need to go there in a crowd
if you just go with two or three people it ' s it ' s not right
you you need a big table 
 uhm 
uhm uhm
 
so there were fourteen of us and there were
some tables
 it ' s for twenty of 
 oh i see 
 so you have to book
there ' s uh reservation
 
uhm
so they have long thin tables 
i see
 
and uh everybody starts to eat about the same time about
 eight o'clock
it ' s on a sat saturday evening 
and then at nine thirty when everybody is finishing their food
 uh the waiters come around and they put mexican sombrero
hats on everybody ' s head 
 uhm 
 yes 
 on everyone 
yeah
 
and then the mexican band who ' re playing all the times switch
from mexican music to western sixties pop 
ah laughs 
 
and they gave everybody a tambourine 
uhm
 
and everybody suddenly goes wild 
 yes 
 
 it ' s like a big party
it ' s really thoughtful 
 yes i see
i see 
so you have a takes a sip from her drink enjoyable night
there
 
 uhm 
well i think the the clientele were predominantly wet
 western 
 uhm 
uhm
 
but there there were two or three chinese tables and they seemed
to enjoy themselves 
 uhm uhm
 
uhm because uh you ' re all sitting there with the silly hat
on and you ' re banging the tambourine and that the band just plays
non-stop for about five hours 
really
 
uhm 
wow
uhm
 
so uh it was a a reasonably expensive night but uh a ve
 very enjoyable one 
is the food expensive there
 
it ' s not the food it ' s the trick as usual 
laughs 
 the trick is as usual is it
yes
in fact a lot of course
 
 not of course laughs 
 yeah have you got plans for easter
what are you going do during easter holidays
 
uhm at the moment nothing
we have a we have a friend coming from uh
england to stay 
 one-word 
oh i see
during easter time
 
so we might go to macau 
uhm
 
just for one day 
and i ' ll try to find this wardrobe that i ' ve been talking
about for ages 
 uhm 
uhm
 
uhm but that ' s all 
uhm
 
i ' d quite like to go away actually but uh as she ' s coming
i see
 
we ' re rather restricted 
uhm
 
uh she ' s uh also a heavy church-goer and she wants to go church
all through the easter 
 she goes on her own
 
weekend
yeah 
she went on
i see
 
and she ' s a mother of the the our lodger who ' s with us in
hong kong 
oh so the mother of your lodger in bristol in
liverpool
 
uh in east east anglia 
 bath 
yes yeah both laugh 
 
she ' s uhm a primary school teacher in her fifties and uh
 she ' s never been anywhere before but she ' s always wanted to come to the
far east and particularly she wants to do the tran-siberian railway 
 
that ' s what she ' s doing 
 uhm oh right
is she going to do this time
where
 
she ' s flying from here to beijing and then going 
back on the tran-siberian 
 oh 
on her own
 
no no uh her daughter is is meeting
her in beijing 
 oh 
 i see i see
oh that ' s the two words 
i see
 
her daughter 
is her daughter staying in beijing
 
well her daughter was also a primary school teacher 
 taught taught music and came to to visit her brother 
 who ' s with us 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm
 
and uh again it was the first time she ' d ever been any an
 anywhere a long way away from the uk 
 uhm 
uhm
 
and she liked it so much she gave up her job and
decided to see the world 
 uhm 
uhm
 
so she ' s travelling round the world and she ' s
in new zealand at the moment and 
and we ' ll time it so she ' ll be in in beijing at the same
time 
but uh the tran-siberian ' s not very safe at the 
moment is it 
 uhm 
 i see 
 no no no 
 
 yeah 
sounds romantic the north sea laughs 
well i didn't do i didn't do much
actually i didn't do anything for the weekends
 
uhm 
yes i didn't feel too well
 
oh dear 
 one-word been a stomach
 upset so i stayed at home and spent the afternoon slept the whole
weekend afternoon and also yesterday
 
uhm 
uhm
 
 but 
 just just what is uh two words
 what but a nice feeling of not doing anything for
 a change
 
 uhm 
uhm it ' s no big deal 
 one word actually just you were
talking i was talking to someone actually someone who is about to to
leave the poly and he ' s in the state of early retirement
 
uhm 
and then we ' re talking about uh for example how much you
need to have for uh retirement
how much do do you think uh you you one-word
 uh income 
 can you generate the income of early retirement
 
 yeah 
uhm uhm 
what what do you think of uh be besides 
three words put us uh career whatever as 
if you ' re going to have a early retirement how much 
income do you think will give you a very well comfortable and you
feel secure and all that
 
 uhm 
i i haven't got a clue
i am very bad at planning such things even
though it ' s it ' s getting clo closer 
well not that early
i mean i ' m in my late forties so i ought to be doing
somethings but i ' ve 
 uhm 
 too early for you 
 three words 
how about staying in you know in say asia that somewhere
like hong kong you go back to england
 
uh uh
we ' ll we ' ll go back to to uk 
uhm
 
and i ' ve always thought that if i didn't have a mortgage if the
house we were living in is paid for then presumably i ' ll be
able to live quite cheaply 
 uhm two-words 
uhm
 
uh and uhm but i don't know if i ' ve generated some expensive
tastes in hong kong 
uhm
 
uh or when you get older 
 you ' ve got all those antiques
 
yes when you get older you you get less interested in
having 
 that ' s right
yes that ' s that ' s how i feel
 
lots of things around you have to dust and keep take care
of get simpler 
 that ' s right if you if you have 
yes that ' s ha 
describe me old 
i was because i ' ve do it exactly what i i said
i ' ve we ' ve got to move to lose interest in things
you say ah four words you ' ve got sat
 saturated you got more several words 
i can't i can't accommodate any and so this is a
 
well uh uh 
 one-word interest is
dwindling
 
i i think with with me too i want to i want to be
concentrating on i mean doing something sensible with my money rather
than being mad about consumerism 
 uhm 
uhm
 
and i mean for instance i have more than one guitar 
uhm
 
uh you know i don't play guitar very well but who needs more
than one 
uhm uhm uhm 
 
 you know you can only play one at a time laughs
 
yes i guess we come to
i don't know whether it ' s just uh uh attempt for you periodically
they comes to uh at a stage is it 
oh there are so many nice things how can you get all
you can't possess all of them so why bother i said is it
 
yeah
i think it ' s but uh this is a very 
i don't know this is this state of mind
this state of mind uh happens now and then and i ' m
always in this state of mind
 
well i used to think for instance you see uhm i spend most of
 my twenty years in england when i when i got a job uhm collecting
books that was my passion 
because i didn't bring the books out here i ' ve
left them in the uk
 i i used to think i couldn't live without them
i just live without them for years and uhm so
why do i need them really 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 yes that ' s right uh 
exactly this two words you got to a
stage
at one stage you thought ah i must have that
i must buy that
i can't really it ' s so multiple words 
because i i i i i haven't i have to one word of all
this is it long-pause 
 
i don't know 
this uh this this is one of hard experience when we left
because uh uh twenty twenty three years ago nineteen nine seventy-two
we left hong kong for australia so uh it ' s it is sadly that state at
that time so many things to pack so many books so that we left there
eight eight cartons of books and other other belongings
 
yeah 
and then we don't we put them in the go in a store
house
and because this the rate is very cheap few hundred dollars
at that time was a hundred dollar but you uh it it it gone up
but uh on that one- word for ten years
 
wow 
but it ' s still only five hundred so uh per week
 
uhm 
per per month sorry
 
uhm 
five hundred dollars
 three words eighty one but this is no the
 o and the other problem when you when and we also took
back a lot of stuff from australia
you you know i think you know the the feeling
uh you can't move from a big house with a lot of stuff to
a smaller house
you you want to throw out everything so that at that time you
thought wow those uh because uh there were those were eight cartons eight
boxes in the in the store room house you see
i ' m thinking first of all i ' ll i ' ll get all the books and
uh uhm most of the books uh we actually had been had been those we
thought useful have been replaced over the years
and uhm of course and also it was when we first come back i don't
know we had we had so many things so many we we have enough headaches 
so we ' re thinking of thinking of should we we don't want to
keep on paying the the uh uh the storage uh uh fees all the time
so then either we take them out to retrieve them and
 two words we thought uh they are a not a big deal
they are really not uh they are duplicates and also you when
you see the eight boxes but you don't know where to put them you see
so uh do i have a one-word very painful
decision
i said okay tell the store house we ' re not going have have
these 
do whatever dispose them
 
uhm 
yeah
uhm and uh another years we start uh i myself start to regret
 wish wish i should not done because not the books
the books are actually more or less duplicates
 
uhm uhm 
you see
in one of the box i put two-words is many
things
 
uhm 
yeah
those uh those albums and those this this is all this all this
 one word things
and i start as i start to miss them
especially uh some of them somethings uh i i collect for
example uh uh stamp albums which i collected since my
secondary school
i still remember what what what was in there
i i had a whole set of the malaysia when they
became one-word when they became
independent
whole set of stamps 
and also uh uh uh one or two very
at that time when i was a a schoolgirl i was already very
valuable
 i was this that
i was in that 
$z laughs 
but at that time i i i just just don't want to because if i want
to dig this up i have to take to the whole thing and i i don't know which
 which box was in here
 
 uh 
 right 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
uhm 
and this would be
at that time it was a greatly i i got a headache
sometimes so i said out three words 
if i i can be away with it ten years i don't need any
more
but now i start to miss this kind of this this a few of
 those albums
a few of them now are those are those one-word
 which i which i collect over over when i was since you
 young girl
these are all my memories during the even after all these
years
a teenagers you see and i still i still uh start 
to miss these things you see
so that i decide actually we when whenever if there ' s any
move and that should not be affected by the that state of mind at that
time
 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
 two words 
yeah
no matter how bothersome or troublesome at that time we
should still uh try to collect them actually
 yeah yeah 
 
 yeah i think you ' ll you ' ll get more
discerning about what to throw away and what not
 uh you know while you were talking i w
 i was thinking of one or two instances of the things i ' ve
i ' ve thrown away or sold that i deeply regret now 
 that ' s right
yes
yeah 
 yes yeah 
 uhm 
uhm
 
uh but uh there there are less and less of them as i grow older
 yeah 
and uh i have thrown a lot of stuff away over the
years still 
but uh it is very difficult 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm 
 one-word 
 three words one of them is the is the stamp
the other things that i have been collecting a lot of uh 
clippings and uh on and on
and also not exactly a diary but also i am writing a lot of uh
annotation and all two-words 
this is actually a reflection of a memories of a teenager
 as i two words laughs 
 
 yes 
yes 
yeah because at that time i was 
i was i was i was a bit i was a very pleased about chinese
opera 
and also i collect a lot of these and one-word
 of write uh
i try to write
i thought it was like something like of uh uh uhm uh uh uh 
s th some something uh uh more creative work of this and this and also
 two words all these things that will go on 
one-word laughs 
because at that time i really want i don't i want to to
actually i was deliberate as i put this in the because uh i
want to one-word why why didn't i never uh why didn't i
know about this
because at that time two-words this is a
 tut this is a very strange way of think i just want to depart from
this so that i really i try to bury this inside the box
otherwise because five words just just a
 just an album i didn't i brought it to australia 
 but this is not uh physically not a burden but
it ' s sort of i deliberately want to part part part away from the
memories you see 
it is a worries that i put it in a box but now i say i
should have taken it out 
yeah because at at at a certain stage i my i myself this is so
 so so so silly so so so what
so childish you see to do this kind
of things laughs 
but uh but uh but now i s remember to two words
 so that when i say that wow i don't know where what did the
store man what did the people from the storehouse did with those uh those
things
will they sold it people that people at the hollywood road the
customers
i say if so say one day if one day i just when i was uh
 uh uh walking along one- word i saw one of one of
the albums i would buy it back regardless of the of
of of its price laughs 
 
 i ' d like to read those laughs 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
well i i have uhm dreams of doing something like that
 in fact when when i was a student uh my 
uh we weren't married but my my wife bought me a
tankard you know uh a one-word tankard 
and uh she engraved on it ' s a a line from bertrand
russell 
uh uh it was uh a line of poetry but he he wasn't a poet
really but he he wrote this line of poetry when he when he first fell in
love 
and uhm this tankard got stolen at a student party 
 and i ' m still looking for it 
every time i go back to britain and go into a junk shop 
 i think uh uh the the the tankard shape is distinctive 
 
and of course with this line of poetry engraved on the bottom it ' s
it ' s unique so i hope i ' m sure i will find it 
 laughs 
i ' m de determined to find it 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 two-words 
 ye laughs 
yes
 
who whoever stole it from the party i would i ' ll love to meet
 meet him or her still both laugh 
yes all these
 
but you 
experiences is it
 yes 
 
 uhm 
the worst the worst uh is going round with my mother uh to
antique shops and my mother constantly saying oh in the
nineteen fifties i threw that out 
$a laughs or i we used to have four of those 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 coughs are sold 
yes yeah
 
 are you alright 
 three words 
yeah
 
cos my my uh my grandmother had a great big house
it has five floors 
uhm
 
and and a cellar 
uhm
 
and uh even in the in the nineteen fifties i 
remember uh at least one room was totally victorian
 it still it was still it had an organ 
 and a piano a pipe a one-word
 and a piano a huge dinning room table a a bible in welsh that
was about uh uh i think about four inches thick 
 uhm 
 is it 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
yeah 
$a laughs 
 four words 
 
all gone 
yeah all
 
all gone
and my mother said every room used to be like
that and that she got rid of 
 uhm 
 uhm 
who one-word put the house there
 
stacks of stuff in the wall
the house we we when my grandmother died we moved to a much
smaller one because my f father just couldn't keep it
all 
 uhm yes 
i see sold the house
 
 i mean 
then it one-word a kindergarten because it
was so big and then it became uh flats 
 and then it was burnt down 
 uhm 
 uhm 
oh
 
so there is there there is still a row of very large houses in
this road 
uhm
 
quite dilapidated now in liverpool 
 but the there ' s a gap where our house used to be 
because they didn't rebuild on on the plot 
$a coughs 
so it ' s quite sad really 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 i see 
uhm uhm
 
and uh i ' ve taken my children to to look at it 
i see
 
and i showed them where the house used to be 
i don't know
really i don't know how my my father managed it in the
fifties to heat it even 
i remember going to bed with 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 it ' s a little bit cold is it
 
oh yes
it ' s freezing cold 
uhm
uhm
 
there were there were blinds on the window but uh
they were victorian 
 uhm 
do you have a fireplace in every every room
 
and a fireplace in every room 
we used to have coal fires in uh in winter in
the bedrooms and still uh uh clothe upon clothe upon
clothe to keep keep warm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 keep warm 
yeah
 
 but still i always sleep better in the cold than in the
hot
that ' s why in summer in hong kong i don't sleep
very well laughs 
 uhm 
uhm uhm uhm laughs 
 
i ' m sleeping well at the moment as it ' s so cold 
yes yes yeah 
uhm
uhm
 
uh it was uh it was an amazing house because at christmas we
could have the whole family staying
there were so many rooms 
i see
how many rooms are there
 
uh i don't know
i think we had seven bedrooms and three attics that
were empty 
 uhm uhm 
uhm
 
so right at the top we we could have expanded
in there if we if necessary but we never did 
 oh i see 
 yeah i see 
uhm
 
uh a huge victorian pile really 
 uhm 
uhm a pause 
 
so my mother now is quite exasperated with me because i ' m i ' m
trying to collect all the stuff i saw as a child and she gave away both
laugh 
 and i ' m now buying 
 it it happens 
 one-word hong kong tourism 
and it ' s by spending money to buy those that uh the parents threw
away uh in the fifties or sixties when they try to to change to to swap to
 well more they called the modern furniture at the time laughs 
it happened
 
 uhm 
yes 
 three words 
 
about what 
what what is it
 
well it ' s it ' s first of all our special collections and uh
 all of us going to move the uhm the special the semi-closed reserve
around so we can insert for china uh books 
but in moving the china books to semi-closed reserve we ' ve 
closed reserve we have to change the one-word
 
 uhm 
uhm yes 
 
 so that i i ' m just pointing this out
 that ' s right 
yes i i just want to bring this up to you
laura talked to me
 
yeah 
and one-word said that
it ' s one- word this bit been discussed in mt
i said no but i think because uh uh collin and myself have
been discussing
he said that uh because of the reason she ask because 
warren told her that it was an mt decision
 
yeah 
yeah
 
yeah
he he ' s wrong that i ' ve 
it ' s it ' s not his fault it ' s mine because i i ' ve had i ' ve
 been meaning to introduce it to to our library management till
 before 
 yeah 
 uhm 
uhm uhm
 
for five weeks now it ' s been so busy and i
just uh put it in the base but i ' ll i ' ll bring it forward to
tomorrow be because uh i didn't realize it would have repercussions on all
the sections like uh like maurice ' s as well so let ' s do
something 
 uhm 
 uhm yeah 
yeah because she was worrying whether these over a thousand books
on the shelves whether uh uh uh at another time
will these books will be removed to to the closer stacks
 
 uhm 
 move again
uhm 
well the i the the idea w 
sorry
after you 
 cause i told
yeah her 
i told her actually my consideration is not solely space
my concern is that these books have been put on the semi-close
stacks so that as many people could use it as possible 
but with a certain measure of control
 
 yes 
yes 
yeah that ' s fine
 
well that that that ' s that ' s what i i thought that actually
 t this would progress uh even if the hong kong china collection
 uh did progress and we set off that these books remain in
 semi-close
they wouldn't back to close 
and i think that was some one-word about
 one-word in the in the hong kong china
collection but uh i must put it through lmt 
 lau laura ' s right 
 uhm yeah 
 uhm 
yes yes 
 no i don't think we would uh 
 uhm 
 yes otherwise it ' s
i mean 
yeah oh yes
yeah to put it down so that yes
 
i ' ve been meaning to talk to you about it before 
before going to lmt with it
i want to be a assured of the of some sort of support
before i bring it in 
 yeah 
$a laughs yeah 
yes sure yes
 
brings me to the next topic 
yes
 
uh in the circulation section you ' ve been talking about the
obc 
uhm yeah 
 
because uh you remember there was a complaint a few weeks ago
 uh that the library uh when the library 
computer system went down there was a long time before we we
put in a replacement computer system 
 yeah 
 not very long 
 we decided to do to use the replacement 
yeah 19
