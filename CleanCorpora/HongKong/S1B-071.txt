""
""
uh we had a discussions uh in the of frequency curve during the
panel meeting and we found that the central tendency in each level is normal
and match with the streaming
""
however we still have some remarks in each level
""
uh for form one uh mathematics uh totally uh there were only a few
uh fail in the test that means we have a higher percent passing percentage
""
uh  uh for the students who fail in the test they are mainly from
one d and one e and there are eight students uh
""
they perform badly and their marks were below forty
""
although uh we have a high passing percentage uh the average
standard was not good compare with last year
""
uh we found that uh they have difficulty in learning when english
was used and their basic mathematics skills was not satisfactory
""
and in the meeting uh we also discuss the immediate measure of this
 one word 
""
uh if you uhm plan to include some s six student helpers to help s
one speakers students to improve their maths basic skills and so consolidate
their maths knowledge in the second term
""
in  edge  school uh we have uh setting arrangement this year
""
there were cross settings in two c two d and two e class
""
the four groups of students uh were grouped according to their
maths result in s one
""
of course uh set four contains the worst twenty students from the e
class
""
and we found that uh from the uh distributing curve uh two f four
that mean the set four have worst result as we expected
""
uh but when we look at uh the result of set one two s one we found
out there were five students perform very well and got marks higher than
ninety percent
""
so in view of this high standards uh uh these students can be put
into b class or even a class
""
they could not enter a class or b class because they did not do
well in other subjects
""
and in s two set set two uh the distribution curve is a very good
bell shaped curve
""
there are very narrow range and standard deviation uh their range
is very narrow and 
""
and we found that uh in uh in s two there are a few students uhm
who do very well and who got marks uh uh greater than ninety percent
""
therefore students uh sorry teachers suggest that uh one or two
students uh maybe put uh uh to the higher stance uh in the next term uh
second term
""
for s three uh there is no special remarks for this form
""
and for s four four a is it was the worst
""
although the distribution for four b and four c were seem different
""
they both spread widely that means they have large range and
standard deviation 
""
in fact their performance are similar
""
they have uhm that means they have more or less the same
""
in four c there were five students who got very low marks
""
teacher will pay more attention uh on the value of these students
""
uh for form four a maths uh to the students it is a new and
difficult subject to them
""
uh this means to greater range or standard deviation in the
distribution curve
""
teacher will try to uh help help them learn more skills and
techniques for the subject
""
they need time to get improvement
""
that  ' s all
""
""
thank you mr kai
""
any any comments 
""
physics
""
""
i  ' m going to ask them this is table
""
all form three classes are normally distributed with the peak shift
from uh three a to three d except three e class
""
the mean varies from eighty to forty
""
as we know if it is a normal distribution are twenty students
should be in the middle whereas uh very weak and very bright students should
be in the two extreme
""
however most of the three e students it seems to be uh very weak
and and very lazy
""
so there are two peaks in three e class
""
as three e class cause such a poor result it means they could not
master physics at all
""
in order to help these kind student to catch up in the future
examination ten students from three c ten students from three d and twenty
students from thee e have been selected by fixed teacher to attend exact
lesson every week
""
 is anson  wong and i will solve some problems for them in
the tutorial class
""
in addition as form six students they are not bounded by the public
exam so we are going to  intro  introduce some activity approach to
arose students ' interest especially in three c thee d and three e classes
""
furthermore we  ' ll develop the curriculum to divide it into core
material and and extension material
""
more classes have to finish the core material but the extension
material will vary from class to class
""
in examination the core material will contribute seventy five
percent whereas the extension will contribute twenty five percent
""
for form four students both sound classes are normally distributed
""
four e is satisfactory but four d is below standard
""
the overall passing percentage is sixty three and the mean is fifty
three
""
there is a big difference in the ability of four d and four e
classes
""
the gap is special wider than last year
""
uh  it it maybe because three d classes they are quite talkative
and they are not attentive enough
""
so i will try to  collect or change their behaviour and also
extra resources such as tutoring classes will be arranged for four d to
upgrade their performance
""
that  ' s it
""
""
good to hear that uh in form three some of the weak students
will take up  immediate lessons
""
but uh i may pay more attention to four d
""
as you say they below standard right
""
pay more attention
""
so discussion with uh miss wong okay
""
chemistry
""
""
uh for the whole form even form three and form four the
distribution curve had been considered uh normal but if we uh look at for
form three a and three b they seem that their result are quite  two
words 
""
that might be due to the fact that the uh put the most uh ability
uh students in uh form three a and also in three b and also we just uh give
it subject to them for a few uh a few week
""
okay we only get three lesson in uh one cycle and will not cover
very much
""
so the question that we set in this uh organized test were very uh
easy
""
so very easy for them to uh get a mark
""
although we also get uh some class explanation but we don't or will
pay too much mark for this
""
so they won't uh lose too much mark and we i hope that uh in the
coming exam we will also consider the paper will be more uh involving uh pass
uh even will be more challenging to the most ability mark
""
that mean we will also give some more question about uh involving
higher power uh ability and also uh we will teach uh more about the chemical
knowledge
""
so there would be some more question about sequence uh
comprehensive and long long term uh recalling memory
""
and uh even this time uh for three e the mark not too low that
means uh they get a mean over fifty
""
and then for four d the gap a large difference
""
uh for example for the mean the mark for four d and four e get a
difference of about nearly twenty percent twenty marks that mean uhm that get
a large difference
""
but anyway that mean they  ' re trying to uh group the best one in uh
four e and a little bit worse one in four d
""
so uh that we will ask the uh teacher who teach the big class to
help them more
""
""
and the question is uh is any form three paper different to
maybe  di  difficulty they don't understand
""
""
uh not say difficult
""
because we cover a larger more material this time    
""
the last time we just taught
""
""
 uh  
""
okay  anyway 
""
""
biology 
""
cinderella
""
""
 one word 
""
uh the result of form three form three classes were  satisfact
 were satisfactory
""
uh the passing percentage of average marks were in descending order
""
uh that means the three a students got the highest marks
""
uhm  for central general tendency was also in descending order
""
the three a students was uh ninety and for the three e students was
about fifty
""
now this matches the  res  streaming result of the school
""
now from the graph we found that the test paper was quite easy for
three a students because about fifty percent of them got more than nine 
hund  ninety marks
""
in the first exam we will increase the difficulties of the paper
and hope to lower the central tendency to about eighty because we use to
differentiate the most capable student in three a
""
now for the three e student there were two peaks in the graph
""
but it  ' s not difficult because the difference is very small
""
in future we hope to maintain the central tendency of three e at
fifty uhm so the exam exam paper will include about eighteen percent
questions on basic knowledge and twenty percent more difficult questions
""
for form four the result was also satisfactory
""
the overall passing percentage was ninety four
""
the central tendency for four d was sixty and for four e was
seventy
""
this matches the  re  with the streaming
""
now both classes have one peak only
""
the difficulty of the  pa  the test paper was acceptable
""
only five students were failed in the organized test
""
we will observe that their performance if they can most uhm
observe their performance
""
if they cannot meet the standard we will give them some extra
tests before the first exam
""
""
thank you
""
uh if the uh other memos and uh do want  several words
 today
""
then it will be easier for us to follow what you  ' re talking about
""
chinese history mr yuen
 
""
 chinese conservation  
""
""
thank you mr yuen very professional analysis
""
uh but foreseen we we  ' ll have alright
""
we will  two words  behind
""
geography
""
it  ' s a history teacher  a long pause 
""
""
uhm  uh for geography uh form one the result was quite
satisfactory because the passing percentage was ninety percent
""
however when we look at the distribution curve you will find out
that the curve is not a normal one and you can see it  ' s not a normal one
""
so after our discussion we find out that the test result might not
 reflectiable  of the students because of two reasons
""
number one because we only test them the map skills and it didn't
require uh high proficiency of knowledge
""
so there is not much language barrier
""
and secondly it  ' s because they are still in an adjustment period
for the form one students and it  ' s the beginning of the school year and we
only test them a very small part of curriculum
""
so it it difficult to tell the level of the form one students yet
""
however the main problem for the students who fail again is the
language barrier because they misunderstood the questions and also they were
very careless in calculation
""
and the uhm  we think possible solution uhm  is to give them
more map skill exercise to do so that they can familiar of the work used that
of geography so that next time they may not make the same mistakes
""
and for form two uhm the overall performance was quite
satisfactory except two e class
""
the passing percentage is only thirty seven percent
""
uhm after our discussion we find out that it  ' s because on the
topic we tested and it is climate and it was quite abstract and also quite
conceptualized
""
uhm it requires students to have a very high level of application
skills and also very high level of english proficiency
""
and we find out that in two e the boys  are quite poor in
english and also they are quite lazy
""
so they can't do the questions in the test paper and for the girls
uhm they are much better in english and they are more hard hardworking so
they still can get fifty something mark
""
uhm  so
""
and the possible solution uhm we think we have to give extra
students for the two d and two e low ability students
""
uhm so that uhm  it may uh their result may uh be better next
time
""
and for form three uh the 
""
so the distribution curve sorry so uh is quite normal
""
uhm and the result was quite good because the passing percentage
is ninety six percent and the  and the reason is again because we only
test them the map skills and it also require very low may may be lower lower
english proficiency
""
and if the students were attentive and they did all the exercises
given by teachers they they do quite well in the test
""
and for form four it is a disaster the passing percentage is only
forty six percent
""
but it  ' s only the figure only forty six percent
""
because we all know that if they get uhm sixty something marks in
the test they can pass in the school  cert  examination
""
it  ' s not  frankly  they they should  gi  uh get
fifty marks okay
""
uhm uh we find out that uh for form three uh the  a long pause
""
""
okay here are the form four distribution curve is not normal but
 and we find out that for four b uh since they all come from three b most
of students come from three b and three c so the result is quite good and
quite average and uh it  ' s quite a good
""
and for four c uh they come from three a three b three c three d
three e so their ability are were mixed
""
and we find out that there is a group of students who can get very
good result in the test
""
however there  ' s also a group of students who get very very low
marks
""
i think it  ' s because of their mixed ability in this class
""
and for four a uhm a large proportion of the students are quite
 one word  and also less incentive incentive to learn
""
and they all come from three d and thee e class that  ' s why the
result is poor in form four uh in form four
""
and uhm i think for form four uhm again i think we need great 
patience 
""
uh need uh students need more guidance and more encouragement uhm
at
""
we think uh the we think we may give them extra lessons or
guidance or i think most important thing is we have to change their learning
attitudes
""
try to encourage them to learn
""
thank you
""
""
to form four learning a bit  geography
""
so uh mr yuen and miss poon will be to do  three words
""
""
economics miss tam
""
""
uhm  form  uh form four economics the overall result
is satisfactory
""
uh the passing percentage of four a is twenty five percent uh four
boy uh four b ninety two percent four c eighty eight percent
""
uh although four b and four c uh have similar passing percentage
but the standard  de  uh the standard deviation of four c is larger
because uhm of the mixed ability of students
""
and i found that some students are uh they were able to write down
the meaning of economics concepts correctly but uh they were rather weak in
applying the concepts in answering the questions
""
and the main difficulty is that uhm students most of them they are
not willing to think independently and they just ask for answers
""
they just sit there and they ask for answers
""
so it it it i still cannot solve this problem
""
uhm four a students uh fail either because uhm they did not work
hard enough or uhm they  even though they uh study but they misunderstood
the questions
""
that  ' s all  a long pause 
""
""
so miss tam you have the challenge to work together to solve
of learning passively students
""
computer studies  a long pause 
""
""
alright for computer studies okay it is a subject extended
from the weakest class to the strongest class and the you can see that the
paper here is suitable for the average student which is in four d
""
okay so in four d you can see the graph of very good distribution
okay but for four e class this paper is proved to be too simple
""
and for four a b c class okay uh you can see that  uh there is
two different categories of students okay
""
one is in four uh  one word  four b and c and
this one is belong to four a
""
uhm let look at the  alright  uh alright
""
for a passing percentage you can see from four a is only sixty
point seven out of eighteen students so one or two students don't pass in
four a
""
and for four b and four c hundred percent passing rate and find a
high average marks as well and four d okay  passing rate is eighty percent
and four e is hundred percent
""
and overall for the whole students  group  we have seven
one point two four percent passing rate and average marks is fifty seven
point nine okay
""
and  so let  ' s comment on the paper
""
now the difficulty of the paper is suitable for the average
students okay which is mean the students belong to four d
""
and common mistake made by those average student is they are
careless
""
they are little or no experience in application and applied type
questions and they are poor in communication as well
""
and we have some suggestion to improve the student result okay
""
attention on student careless mistakes and discuss more daily life
example with student in class advise students to read computer magazine
frequently
""
so  okay that  ' s all for the computer studies
