  good evening and welcome to this new year eve edition of newsline what is the state of hong kong ' s political parties on the eve of the twentieth first century to what extent were they work with each other and are they still united on the issue of full democracy to discuss these issues we have with us today the chairmen of the three biggest political parties in hong kong martin lee of the democratic party tsang yuk sing of the democratic alliance for the betterment of hong kong and james tien of the liberal party welcome gentlemen and thanks for taking kind one-word  during a holiday period comes on to the programme martin if i may start of you uh what kind of shape is your party you lost uh like hundred and seventy thousand votes in the last election  yeah we are still uh waiting for uhm an opportunity to do a very shorter review and we are busily doing that and until that time i ' m afraid that we can only talk about reform i certainly want to uh do a quite lot about the party we we know quite a lot of uh difficulties but how to overcome them is then of course is the next problem   but uhm you ' re pretty confidence that you can overcome these   problems   oh yes including uh certainly uh uniting the party again because that important it uh     uhm uhm  and tsang yuk sing uh your party has some serious problem also your vice- chairman was forced to resign uh and uh uh you you lost the uh recent by election uh on hong kong island  right   uh what kind of shape overall one-word    but we we are still uh assessing the uh damage caused by uh uh gary cheng ' s scandal oh uh she said we lost vice-chairman we lost uh various safe seat uh on hong kong island we are still looking for uh replacement uh uh for substitute uh to uhm take up the uh vacant post left left over by uh mr cheng uh so i mean that ' s it    uhm  uh ha so so you one-word   you also has a one-words  our wound and martin martin said before the septem election that the dab will set to become the largest party in the uh in the legco   uh ha and that hasn't happened is that but you ' ve are you confidence that will happen   right  well we our aim now is to become a large party i mean to be largest doesn't really make uh uh uh very much uh meaning uh  but uhm you know we we have to do a lot we are still a a far way from being uh really uh decent political party     uhm   i agree     uh ha  well james what about the liberal i mean uh you have fewer members now than you did uh previously  and in the uh recent election you you had nobody won in the direct elections uh what kind of shape are you in what what do you think the future hold   yeah  uh although we only lost one seat on the functional constituency side we have uhm eight uh instead of nine from last section   but uh again like you said we still looking for the breakthrough on the direct election side  the candidates uh we try to fill are not our top  one-word uh legislators with past experience  uh so most of the new comers are second layer  then do that well although one or two were quite encouraging we did get uh more votes than uh last time  but again like i said we ' re still uh not happy with the result we would want to see uh having a breakthrough by actually winning one seat so our strategy now maybe for year two o o four was not again to spread ourself through fit with our second layers  and may be we should come over someone to just simply put all our effort to win one seat in one of the five territories in hong kong  but what is more is mean uhm what uh uh uh what ' s supporting for me is that our district work uh we seem to be a little bit at loss about how to rule we used to be tried to work a dab or dp  like what are they doing successfully so we try to do what they were doing successfully to get some success uh for our candidates but it seems that their past uh uh success story uh is also failing like lee wing tat so may be we will have to uh do little better to see what  are the areas that able successful at and try to do what they are you or shall we come overs our way   of trying to do more uh district work or  grassroots work     uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   right   will you use to be more authoritative than than martin and i on district work is use uh uh now uh the the member of the district council who we are not that ' s my first experience personally but that ' s actually uh easier just when i represent the peak or the central western district board and these the problem uh to to those residents are more confine to the local community they are not really interested in the big issue we we  talk about at least uh in my constituency     uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   right  so uh you are determined to uh run at first someone in your party to run into right elections next time uh   was was a test or actually concentrating in one area like should one-word should should it be like hong kong island or should it be new territory east or west instead of trying to fill three or four candidate across the whole territory  and the point whether we should come out was one of our existing legislators is something we seriously considering now for two  o o     i see   uh ha   right   uhm   right   uh james you you surly that ' s a wrong question uh who should come out where the question is uhm we i think i was suggesting  you that you guys must all come out uh in every constituency there are only five large one uh that ' s the way to go forward and not to sit back and count on the functional constituency seats still remaining but come out sooner and later   but martin you in each  if you suggest that to me you still have three of the functional constituent seats like one word cheung man kwong i think we should have gone for direct election  why he ' s still contesting the education seat   oh yeah oh yes we   oh yeah   but we we are  we are doing our best  several words he he ' s more directly electable that a lot of us   oh yeah absou   yes but we have definitely uh pushing for the evolution of all these functional constituency seat as soon as possible   uhm uhm   yeah     right okay uhm now the three parties together your your three parties together uh and up to thirty seat in uh legco right uh so that ' s actually majority since the president doesn't vote and if you the three of uh if you can cooperate on issues uh you can you can get a lot of things uh one-word   we can certainly block a lot of things we can block everything particularly    uh ha  but what do you think of the idea of of having a coalition of your three parties in the legislature uh uh tsang yuk sing  well in in in the first place we we three  one-word parties alright in  i i i don't rule out the possibility of uh cooperating   on specific issue certainly we have done so uh in the past uhm on on on various occasions but uhm uhm if you ' re talking of uh a consistent long standing uh coalition then i don't think uh uh the the the uhm up till now uh the the basic beliefs the uhm es  especially our political uh stance of of each our each each the three each of the three parties uh would make that possible    uh ha coalition is not possible   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm um   uhm uhm  uhm uhm  but surely the problem is that we don't uh i mean we stuck together alright and at the last debate on of the last term   uh on the motion of no confidence of the director of housing alright and immediately after that because we were then resolved the chief executive then said well uh the director of housing has been doing a fine job he remains  so when we resume we try to do something about that and we lost immediately the support of the two other parties uh that ' s the time when we should have remain together   now to push it through    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh  no no too unfair martin when because it was fred li from your party who uh  vote that motion right  not yes but when fred ask for our support when he was lobbying uh among other colleagues in the uh in the legco he made it a point that he was not asking for the resignation  of anyone he said this is only a motion that tells the public we have no confidence in these two uh people we are not asking for the removal or resignation of anybody no that was what fred li clearly said in in his speech   one-word   yeah   and you support it   how can we tolerate the same man occupying exactly the same post in dealing with us when we together pass the motion several words  post   but martin i think two-words this relevant right now  we passed the motion with the cooperation of the three parties but still government the executive lead government is not doing anything about it but on the other hand we still sh we should still try to cooperate more often but i think in this issue between the three party dab is probably  in the best position because politically probably the liberals and dab see eye to eye but a lot of grassroots issue dp and dab see things eye to eye and you think that we ' re always supporting government look at the government fees and charges on businesses we ' re the one who ' s raising objection to government raising fees and charges but dp who ' s always saying they ' re against government in this particular incident they ' re supporting government to raise fee and charges on on on small several-words     but do do you think   do you think the right now there is no government party in the legislature do you think the government need one-word of a party in the legislature   well it should gov government has the party on on crucial things then they can count up to thirty nine legislators  uh well   they are not  they they don't want to right now so because     your your your one-word  dab as the government party  well and and the other i mean you have this  the democratic camp uh small letter d i know we have about twenty one i mean look at the crucial vote for example the most recent one was the one on the uh public order ordinance section  seventy eight the one moved by the secretary for security  and the well the uh most speakers who spoke i remember very clearly uh found that the there were something wrong with it you know   and and yet some people     uh ha   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm uhm   well the time one-word ask tsang tsang yuk sing  do you think yourself is a government party   well  well uh martin martin ' s speaking as if uh what he ' s calls the democratic camp must be in your position that is dpd democratic camp would always vote against the government whereas the others always vote for the government  don't i don't see necessity in that  yeah   yeah two-words   uh i ' m i ' m sorry   well i ' m i ' m sorry i i sup   crucial matters the government can always count on the thirty nine    uhm   okay   what     is is it true on crucial matters  one-word govern our counts on you   no i mean it depends it depends on what do you mean what you mean by crucial it ' s crucial to martin but not to  us   well   you right i mean human rights to me   no sometimes uh what i can say is this perhaps well more often than not the government would think that it is easier to lock people support uhm uhm among the dab members or it perhaps among the liberal party members   and among uh martin party so the government may reason this way now if this motion uhm is not supported even by the dab or even by the democratic party uh by the uh  liberal party then we may as well we thought alright it may be their logic  so i     uh uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   one-word uhm   uhm uhm   why don't you let people withdraw it and you said there ' s no necessities   well and and and they did i mean uh there there were examples when the government really show there was no chance of you know its motion getting through so they so they one-word   or that motion to be fair uh the public or the audience uh a lot of business and professional spoke out to say that there is a need for the ordinance and eventually democratic party agree too it ' s just on the detail whether you need a seven day  voters and the thirty person requiring a one-word    yeah   and then you should you should be supporting me because the wording of the motion is very specific if you support the motion at all that means the government can keep the whole theme   but look at your amend and your amendment is worse no no but but even after i i   are you suggesting we should vote  against amendment and your original motion     uhm   i ' m sorry   even after amendments failed you should have  you should have refuse to support your original motion move by the government to make sure that the government will have to go back and put the thinking cap point and work with other people to improve the law  surely that is   but secu the security said the i putting in the thinking one-word and look into  that issue  yeah    i ' m i ' m sorry uh we have to take a break now don't go away we ' ll be right back commercial beak  welcome back we ' re talking to the chairmen of the three biggest political parties in hong kong uh james we ' re talking cooperation among the various parties do you think that your three parties can cooperate more  certainly now although martin likes there are certain motions that has been passing uh past but the government still does not take it seriously but that at least better to the general for the as far the general public is concern that there are certain things that the three of us agree  a lot of our motion debate now you could see that if the liberal party raises uh uh propose a motion we never talk to the  to dp or dab and then they would put uh an amendment just may be doesn't like part of the things <{4 that we proposed  and they do the same thing uh when they were proposing  one-word     uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   i see   so   so uh     why don't you talk to each other i mean    well that ' s why i ' m suggesting that   may be in future uh we should we should do uh     uh ha   but uh     yeah uh tsang yuk sing do you think you could do that  on on the yes definitely on the on the one hand only all want to see things done you ' re all want to get things done alright and and and of course we understand that uh if we cooperate then it will be much easier for us to do things can things moving but on the other hand i think it is it is reality that uhm  we become rivals during elections  and now if and we achievement if if if no well well you have a point that  what i ' m saying is if every achievement of the legco uh is equally creditable to all the different parties then then how do we stand out uh i mean apart from the others i mean this is the kind of mentality that that often  drives members of different parties to you know to take independent commission     uhm uhm   uhm   but in one-word election all yes  way uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   right but in in the main function of legco is to act as a check on the administration and if uh you all go in your own ways and you cannot act effectively as a check two-words working  together then you can check the government   yeah so one-word   yeah for example or air pollution  we are all concern about air pollution so we all come up with our ten details fine point  but if just when issue whether the fine should be one thousand dollar or i proposed two thousand  and someone think two thousand is too much i ' m sure we should talk about it and uh we are some so that that the whole uh motion will get pass instead of i voting your against it and they voting uh against on  our vote   yeah right     uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm     uhm   yeah   now martin the   your on  on pollution matters that are really happening and in fact uh we one- word doing that even during the last ten of office  now but i i i certainly uh an great supporter this idea because if you can agree on important policy issues we are effectively a coalition    uhm  right  alright and   but it ' s probably in the sense     uhm uhm   uh uh yes and we can now but the the important premise is we must be prepared to stick together on the uh things we have agreed on and use the only weapon we have which is well the most powerful and which is to vote down the budget if the government doesn't face  one-word  now are they all prepared to do that    uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  well i don't think you may you ' re prepared to do that
