 five words in cantonese will the administration try to think about some admins administrative guidelines for the land resumptions in such a way that the people get the money which is sufficient for the land for the property owners to buy the reasonable flats or shops to carry on their livelihood in the same area  several-speeches  mr deputy president the secretary justified not having secretary uh guidelines by saying that uh it has been satisfactory in the past can he tell this council how many resumption cases have been objected to in the next uh in the last five years  several-speeches  mr deputy president in the secretary ' s reply on the last paragraph he said property owners are offer compensation base on the market value of the properties may i ask the compensation on market value does it include not only the premises but also the redevelopment potential of the property  several-speeches  mr acting deputy president after the omelco consensus had been dropped by the british government in its negotiations with the chinese government what was the reason for not informing the then non-government members of this legislative council of this fact since all such members had contributed to the formation of the omelco consensus and all of them had by virtue of such non-disclosure been fully kept in the dark until the recent publication of the seven secret documents  several-speeches  the secretary in his answer uh did not really answer question b and that is whether the executive council were shown all the relevant documents that were disclose recently and whether in fact there are any other documents relevant to these discussions that have not ha has yet been published could he perhaps uh answer that part of the question  several-speeches     mi   elucidation uh mis  the secretary still has not answered the question  fully briefed doesn't answer the question as whether members of exco were shown the secret letters that we have now been shown    yes elucidation   speech-by-acting-deputy-president    sir my my question was exactly the same   speech-by-acting-deputy    yes mr arculli   question  i ask for elucidation and uh you did not whether rule me out of order or whether the secretary should answer  speech-by-acting-deputy-president  with respect uh sir if if you think that my question if you think that the secretary has answered the question then perhaps you ' ll rule my question seeking clarification as being a question being out of order  several-speeches  mr deputy president i rise to move the motion standing in my name in the order paper to the extent that the joint declaration commanded the confidence of hong kong in nineteen eighty-four it did so by offering a series of important promises in unambiguous terms  it promised that hong kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy from the chinese central government that the legislature would be elected to office that hong kong would be invested with independent judicial power including that of final adjudication that rights and freedoms would be protected and extended and that until nineteen ninety-seven britain alone would be responsible for the administration of hong kong with china promising its cooperation in that regard  those were the pillars on which hong kong ' s future was to rest  sir these pillars are tottering  they are being undermined by a force of which we were told nothing in nineteen eighty-four which made no appearance in the joint declaration and which was imported by stealth into the transitional arrangements some time between november eighty-five and january eighty-six the force of which i speak here is what we now call convergence a misleading name since it suggests a mutuality of movement by the parties deemed to be converging in the case of hong kong convergence seems only to mean what china says it wants and that britain after a decent interval of hesitation agrees we have been hypnotised by convergence  it is a device introduce by china to serve china ' s ends  convergence is not a strategy it is a tactic yet we are told to treat it as a virtue a necessity even incredibly as a high principle capable of eroding promises set down in the joint declaration which we once so trustingly assumed to be sacrosanct convergence is frustrating the desire of hong kong for the rapid development of democratic government  it is contesting the authority of the present administration it mocks our expectation of a high degree of autonomy in hong kong after nineteen ninety-seven  why do we suffer this we do so because we are told that convergence is the necessary basis for a smooth transition in nineteen ninety-seven but let me suggest otherwise at britain ' s and china ' s behest we have been attempting to converge with the post ninety-seven political system which as set down in the basic law falls dangerously short of our standards and requirements  i remind this council that we have already declared our support for the honourable jimmy macgregor ' s motion on october fourteenth that the election committee should be composed of the democratically elected district board members  china ' s ill-reasoned denunciation of the proposed ninety-five election committee structure shows that convergence serves mainly as a useful cover for instinctive hostility towards democratic reform  there is then the publication on october twenty-eighth of correspondence between the british and chinese foreign ministers on the subject of constitutional reforms in hong kong  though these letters do not as china claims reveal a secret agreement with britain they do reveal an attitude towards democracy which is scarcely less distressing  they show that democracy in hong kong has been regarded by london and by beijing alike not as a value but as a commodity something to be bartered bargained over ma ma managed and exploited deputy president i fear that some may accuse me of failing to justify my argument by reference to fact and to detail  i would like therefore to remind the chamber of some of the specific problems which will confront us during the nineteen ninety-seven transition however tape-ends to innovate convergence merely makes the situation worse  this council ' s reward for converging we are told would be the through train very well but how then do we accommodate article sixty-seven of the basic law it provides as you will remember that permanent residents of the region who are not of chinese nationality or who have the right of abode in foreign countries may not exceed twenty percent of the total membership of this council  the problem is that we do not know who will or who will not be considered a chinese national after nineteen ninety-seven china ' s nationality law is too vague and untested for us to be sure how objectively that law will or even can be applied in hong kong after nineteen ninety-seven  would article sixty-seven restrict those who can stand in all constituencies or just in some constituencies  would we do better to see who was elected and then draw lots as to who should be compelled to stand down  and would we then hold fresh elections to fill the vacancies starting the cycle all over again  this is the direction in which the logic of convergence pushes us is this our idea of a smooth transition surely it cannot be article sixty-seven of the basic law alone makes it impossible to reconcile the principle of convergence with the ideal of a smooth transition let me now proceed to another contradiction i remind this council of the decision that was adopted on april fourth nineteen ninety by the national people ' s congress on the method for the formation of the first government and the first legislative council of the hong kong special administrative region  it provide that members of the legislative council may only continue to serve onward from nineteen ninety-seven to nineteen ninety-nine after they have been confirmed in office by a preparatory committee appointed by the chinese central government  the identity of this committee is still a mystery to us the mandate of this preparatory committee is not only to scrutinise the composition of this council for conformity with the basic law but also to examine the individual council members themselves  it must ensure that only those members who uphold the basic law and pledge allegiance to the hong kong sar will continue to serve before nineteen ninety-seven  i do not think that any of us here will have any problems pledging allegiance to the hong kong sar  but what does it mean to uphold the basic law does it mean to obey the basic law in so far as it prescribes particular courses of action or does it mean to espouse the basic law in every detail and not to question it if the latter then any member of this council who has suggested that the basic law should be amended in any way has theoretically rendered themselves vulnerable to the preparatory committee ' s mandate  the fact is this  as in all other matters of interpretation it is up to china they are to be decided upon by the standing committee of the national people ' s congress a body under the political control of the communist party and because we cannot possibly forecast how the communist party will choose to exercise its absolute discretion in interpreting the basic law during and after ninety-seven we cannot converge in any sure verifiable way some of the members elected to this council in nineteen ninety-one may not be acceptable to china come nineteen ninety-seven yet those same members have every prospect of being re-elected in nineteen ninety-five if they choose to stand  we must expect that the preparatory committee and perhaps the nationality rules will then be use to block their way  fresh elections will presumably be inevitable and the possibility of a smooth transition will again be frustrated not by any failure of convergence but by criteria invented and imposed by china without any basis in the joint declaration  if elected representatives of the people can be removed from this council by the preparatory committee that would be a total abnegation of democracy and make a mockery of the basic law ' s promise in article sixty-eight that the ultimate aim is the election of all members of this council by universal suffrage  those who say that bumping off one or two elected legislators does not affect a throos does not affect a smooth transition are totally misguided the joint declaration promised hong kong the freedom of speech and the freedom of the ballot box let us not be lured into conspiring against those freedoms in the name of convergence let us remain true to our beliefs and to our values and let us urge britain and china alike to respect our right to do so  sir i come now to the text of my motion it says nothing about convergence the motion looks forward to a continuing dialogue between the british and the chinese government on political reform  the motion requires that the dialogue be an open one  when the future of hong kong is being negotiated the people of hong kong must know what is being said on their behalf that is a matter of right and common decency it should not be an occasional or accidental privilege  the motion requires that the reforms be fair ones in which due weight is given to the democratic wishes of hong kong  finally the motion requires acceptability to the people of hong kong as the objective criterion for reform mr deputy president since i still have some time if i may i would like to comment on all the amendments now because i think that may save time later on would you permit that sir   you have the right to speak to each of the amendments after the amendments are proposed so it ' s really your option one-word     i think it will save time perhaps if i did did it all now because i ' m conscious that many speakers would like to speak if i may i would like to carry on  mr deputy president the honourable jimmy macgregor ' s amendment to my motion is about further democratic reform for hong kong and supports in general the governor ' s reform proposals i therefore support his amendment the honourable name ' s amendment offers hollow sentiment in hollow language i have made my arguments against convergence and against illusory appeals to a smooth transition on that basis there is nothing in mr tsim ' s amendment to undermine my case and much to reinforce it convergence means not merely deference to china ' s wishes but uncritical unconstructive unthinking deference  such deference cannot possibly be in the long-term interest of the people of hong kong the amendment is thus logically and politically wrong  as to the idea that discussion should be conducted on a basis of their realistic acceptability to the people of hong kong i am torn between incomprehension and disbelief are we telling hong kong people that they have to accept whatever is thrusted at them  sir the people of hong kong understand a very great deal they understand much more than the government of britain and china often seem to appreciate  mr tsim cannot expect acquiescence and he certainly cannot be allowed to propose it as this council ' s mandate  our problem is to secure respect for hong kong ' s views  mr tsim ' s amendment is thus regressive and patronising it should be discarded in its entirety  the honourable andrew wong ' s proposed amendment does not answer unfortunately our present needs of course we hope that discussions between britain and china will be friendly ones but it would be naive to issue this proposition as our mandate discussions and negotiations of every kind have their ups and downs  there are periods of rapid progress and there are periods of reflection  if the interest of hong kong require that the british government be firm then it must be so so long as it does so courteously and justly no offence should be given or taken  much of the wording of mr wong ' s amendment has unfortunately been borrowed for less noble ends in more recent years and i worry about the construction which might be put on mr wong ' s references to prosperity and stability and a smooth transition these are phrases which have been appropriated by the advocates of convergence in order to inhibit democratic reform in hong kong  accordingly while i respect mr wong ' s sentiment i cannot support his amendments which would tend both to weaken and to confuse the message which we ' re trying to send the honourable name ' s amendment is a virtuous one but i am concerned that it would lead us away from the main matter of the moment which is the principles by which sino-british dialogue should be conducted accordingly i oppose this amendment not because i think it ' s wrong in principle but because i think the matter needs to be developed more fully at another time with these remarks sir i beg to move the motion with the honourable jimmy macgregor ' s amendment
