""
""
 yeah  
""
how about you  all speakers laugh 
 
""
no i don't have
""
i don't have a boyfriend 
""
""
why
""
do you feel   you  ' re  lonely in hong kong
""
because your relative is not here
 
""
 but  
""
no i  ' m
""
it  ' s surprising because i think i  ' m the only  foreign
student
""
do do do not feel lonely   at  all
""
i don't know why because 
""
the the moment i came to hong kong
""
maybe might i only prepare myself
""
that is i i  tell myself that
""
i  ' m going to be alone and i  ' m   going  to
concentrate on my work
""
and in the progess i met many people
""
and they are all very helpful
""
and cecilia i mean she  ' s my classmate
""
my class i i found that my classmates are quite  fun to be
with  tut     
""
yeah so i didn't feel lonely
""
i  yeah in fact i really enjoy it myself
""
the whole of last  two- words  
""
""
 oh  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
can   i  ask   do  you love your country
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
singapore 
""
""
yeah
 
""
definitely 
""
""
  definitely 
 
""
 definitely  
""
i think
""
okay i  ' m not i  ' m not patriotic
""
  you know  i i  i will not go and fiercely
defend my country
""
but i think uhm singapore is very well run    
""
i mean uhm 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
but i think uh most of the  regulations are very strict
 
""
oh yeah
""
this is   something uh  
""
""
 do you think   any  restrictions   in
 singapore
 
""
 no  
""
the thing is i feel that foreigners
""
i mean people who are not singaporeans    
""
when  uhm when they look at singapore from the outside
""
yeah especially hong kong
""
because i think hong kong  uhm mass media 
""
uhm tend to exaggerate certain information
""
yeah because   a lot of  
""
because sometimes    the 
""
yeah the law in singapore
""
they are not as bad as the film 
""
as the the the    the newspaper  or the  tv in
hong kong make them sound
""
you know it it makes me so uh
""
it makes them sound are very uhm    
two-words, etc 
""
singapore is  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 what kind of information  
""
 such as the law  
""
""
 come back  
""
""
  several words 
""
britain  
 
""
uhm    i think is  
""
""
 because of      the  misbehaviour
   three words  
 
""
 yeah  
""
 oh   oh oh oh
""
yeah misbehaviour
""
you mean uhm  a kind of misbehaviour
""
but   uhm  
""
""
 yeah   there  ' s two   guys 
 
""
 for   ex ex tourist  ' s son right 
""
""
yeah
""
""
uhm uhm
""
i don't know what to say about that
""
but every country has their own laws
""
and if you  uhm  if you committee  your a crime or or
""
i mean you you have to receive the dual punishment 
""
""
yeah
 
""
yeah so  
""
""
but i don't think chewing gum is a    is a kind of
""
 
""
 okay chewing chewing gum  
""
okay chewing gum is  is not forbidden
""
but you are not supposed to sell it 
 laughs  
""
""
supposed to sell
""
but   how can 
 
""
 yeah how   should
""
exactly so if you find a loophole in the law
""
you you like  one-word 
""
then you can go around it
""
  because  i eat chewing gum when   i  ' m
 in singapore
""
i mean last time i go to eat chewing   gum  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 how   can you buy it
""
the   not the imported of 
 
""
 just just  some   friends will bring from malaysia
""
or some people go from malaysia to singapore
""
they will bring in some    
""
yeah but they are not
""
uhm they don't sell it 
""
""
 oh ha  
""
they don't sell it
 
""
they don't sell it
""
just give it to you
""
we use some   friends 
""
so you you can eat
""
the thing is you must not litter   
""
you  must not uhm
""
we can't uh  public new sons 
""
you know and and cause inconvenience to others 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
 
""
yeah
""
in fact in singapore i feel very free
""
you  ' re free to do everything
""
it just as if you  ' re someone who is  who is uhm uhm 
""
how do you say
""
if you if you care  a bit for the society
""
you will not do things that will  uhm cause inconvenience to
others
""
right so i i think  the law whether is there or
""
it doesn't affect me
""
because i obey it anyway
""
right
""
do not litter 
 laughs 
""
but i don't litter in the first place
""
  so  the law   doesn't affect  me
""

""
""

""

""
""

""
""
 or   education benefit
 
""
education benefit yes 
""
""
  yes 
 
""
 yeah   your your fee are totally subsidized 
""
""

""
yeah 
""
but for me i have to pay a little bit 
""
""
pay a little bit
""
""
oh fees
 
""
yeah 
""
""
fees
 
""
little fees
""
it  ' s a very very little   a few  dollars for a month
""
""
""
 very very little  
""
but i i have heard that the singapore uh education system is very
tense   in 
 
""
 yeah   it  ' s very   very  
""
""
 in   the
""
at the very low level
""
you have to decide which   uh  stream   you
have to 
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 this is something  
""
yeah this is something that i really don't like
""
i really don't like their educational system
""
i think it  ' s too practising and
""
to make someone decide  uhm his path  in life   at
 such a early stage
""
i think   it  ' s it  ' s  
""
""
 yeah  
""
 how early  
""
is it   in the primary  level
 
""
 primary three  
""
primary three   you  have already have streaming 
""
""
 wow  
""
""
already uh six uhm eight years
 
""
yeah  things are simple 
""
parents will decide whether you go to the given  class or the
express class 
""
""
what is the given class   is 
 
""
 given   class uhm  given for those very talented
      people 
""
and then the
""
i  ' m not really sure
""
because i  ' ve been out of the system since  uhm 
""
""
 uh ha  
""
""
 uh ha  
""
how can you skip this system
 
""
not ourself
""
because it didn't occur during my time
""
you   understand  
""
""
 oh  
 
""
yeah
""
it it occur to the  next next   generation  
""
""
 generation    all speakers laugh 
 
""
so i  ' m actually quite old uh  all speakers laugh 
""
yeah uhm  thinks your you does streaming to  other side of
 arts
""
something like that when you  ' re in secondary school
""
i don't know
""
but anyway it  ' s stupid i think
""
i think it  ' s it  ' s it  ' s
""
it gives kids a lot of pressure you know
""
and parents will want their kids to do very well
""
things like that and  tut 
""
i think it affect the child  ' s psychology 
""
""
it seems very difficult to get in uh  tertiary education
""
such as   university 
 
""
 yeah  
""
very very difficult
""
  singapore  university 
""
""
 why
""
cause   there  ' s not enough university or    the
other reason 
 
""
 uhm there are two   two universities
""
but uhm they  ' re all very tough   to get in 
""
very tough to get in yeah 
""
""
 tough  
""
if i can't get into the university i just go out to work at the
a- level
""
""
""
no no no not not the
""
after secondary school you have a-level 
""
""
uhm
 
 that one you can finish it in two or three years
> depending on your o-level result    
> and after that uhm depending on your a-level result
> to see whether you go to the university or polytechnics 
""
""
 uh ha  
""
oh   polytechnics 
 
""
 polytechnics   will be
""
yeah those at uh 
""
""
is it people have uhm more
 
""
yeah choices   yeah  
""
""
 more   choices
