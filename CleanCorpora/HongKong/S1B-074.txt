 thanks 
thanks very much for coming uh 
are you very busy in these days 
 fine

 where uh where where you where
what are you working on at the moment 
 yes 
i ' m working uhm for some interior design works
 
uh ha 
and then uh we have a country house in tai po 
yeah design and build country house
 
 uh ha 
right 
three storey height
 
right 
yeah
i nearly finish that project
 
and you ' re doing the whole of interior design 
 interior and exterior and build
the whole house
not only the interior but the whole house 
 in including the foundations
 
 uh ha 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm 
yeah
 
 how did how did that project you can start then
what was the story behind that 
 yeah 
because i i know the friend uh he was living in in uk 
 and uh he come back and uh he got a land in tai po and 
who he want to uh build a house there
 so we started uh negotiating uh 
design uh and uh cost cost estimation and then we started
last end of last year 
and uh we nearly finish the project 
now now in a stage of uh doing the interior works yeah
the the frame the the structure and the
external work tasks have been finished already and uh it
looks very good that one
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
it sounds good it sounds good 
 i ' ll post in it in a magazine 
later
 
 uh ha 
oh that ' s great
is that of that village style traditional village style
 
 yeah traditional
it ' s an exempted building works
 we don't have to submit that to the buildings
department is exempted 
as long as you you uh follow the regulation set by the the district
lands department then you can do it yeah 
 
 right 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 right 
 uhm 
uhm that ' s good
uhm now it the reason why i ask you to get a date was uh
i ' ve got a few uh repairs to do uhm uh uh uh i think it ' s actually uh
 it it come through here uhm 
 it ' s 
from the master bedroom
 
yeah
uhm you can see see these stains on the window here 
yeah
 
and then nothing would take these off we ' ve been trying to
get those stains off 
the stains is from the from the outside
 
the stain is from the outside when the the the uh
 building
the management company of the building clean the tails outside and
some of the cleaning fluid or whatever it was or some of the glue from
the tail or something drop drip on the windows 
and i reported it uh to the uh to the build uh i ' ve reported
it to the management company uh months and months ago i may send a couple of
people to try to clean and they can't clean it
so these uh so i think the only thing to do is to is to get 
is is basically to replace the glass of this window and get
the uh
cause they can't do anything apparently they can't do anything
about this
they got this
can you see these stains they won't go away 
because uh so i think they should i think they should i think
they got the legal responsibility then to make it right 
so they should replace the window then 
 yeah 
 oh 
 yeah 
 yeah uh sustain 
 yeah 
 yeah 
because when they when they clean tower they use the dilute acid to
 clean the towers and then that ' s why
they they stained the the glass
 
 yeah 
 right 
 uhm 
yeah 
and uh i don't think you can remove it
 
uhm uhm 
yeah but but this is their res responsibility to to
uh replace it for you 
so you can ask the uh management to negotiate
with the contractor
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
uhm 
ask them to replace it with the glass
 
yeah
well although yeah several words 
uh it ' s okay 
this is the the acidic liquid 
fusion uh
 
 right 
 yeah 
right
so that ' s what that ' s two windows there uh lay from these
hole and then uh and then uh
angelina where were the stains on the window
 which 
 uh 
 uh 
 discussing stain here
 
 where were the stains on the windows
yeah this and that or that other windows 
and here as well 
got stain in the bedroom and your living
room
 
 and and 
angelina and here as well was it 
 
yeah it is
i think it ' s soften 
 yeah 
 
here it ' s here we have stains
these stains were come up 
 
can uh 
yeah these these stains
 
 okay 
are these two windows 
or just one window here just one 
 these stains 
 uh this one also 
 
two 
just two 
 
 these two windows here yeah yeah 
and what about in the small bedroom can you try 
 these two yeah 
 
a little bit
you that want some 
 
so one window here as well in your in 
your room 
yeah 
 
 yeah 
 in your room 
yeah 
one in your room and two in the living room
 
 yeah 
 
what about in the smoke
can you check angelina and here 
 
yes the fuel on roof 
 
 right okay
let ' s just check to make sure 
because when they contractor do the external walls 
 
they should protest the the glass first
 
 uhm 
uhm 
here or not 
 
here yeah yeah 
 
 yeah 
so all these windows or 
 
 yes these are 
 
these two 
 
yeah vary this one 
 these two 
 
and this one 
 
that one is okay 
 yeah you can see the stain here 
 
 you can here but this one is okay 
 
alright this one two three windows
can you make a note of that alright 
 yeah 
 three 
three
 
and and two here 
uhm in the guestroom 
two in master bedroom two in living 
two in maid room
yup
 
and uh a long pause 
sorry chinese conservation 
 
uh so that ' s one job uh uh calvin and uhm uh i think
we can i think we can uh claim that from the 
 that ' s we 
 yeah 
from the external wall contractor
 
yeah
well whatever or from the management company 
yeah
uh the other job i was thinking it uh about doing with uhm
actually to uh remove this and uhm uh turn this into
a study for a computer room or something like that you know 
and then but there ' s no electric there is no 
electric here 
socket here 
 yeah or from the management 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 socket here 
yeah
 
so i just wondering how much it will cost to take this out 
and then uhm uh put in a a shelf
may be printed wall and then put in a shelf and turn it in a 
of small computer room 
 uh 
are you going to keep this back
 
no i don't think so no 
yeah own only a computer room 
 yeah 
work top book shelves 
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm 
yeah some shelves yeah 
 some shelves 
the cost for that one
 
uhm 
uhm how how long is it
 
 do you need 
do you need a tap then 
 yeah do you have a measuring tap
 
yeah
angelina can give a measuring tap a long pause 
it no more water mark
 
no that ' s great 
 from the from the conditioner
 
you check the two boxes is it one in there
oh here here 
oh here thank you thanks yup a long pause 
yeah
it is up to to the wall
 
yes right so 
so this is five feet
 
yeah 
yeah 
so one and a six and a half
 
yup yup 
 yup 
six and a half alright
so it costs approximately 
 
 and then maybe you don't need this counting up you
can maybe bring up shelf to this point here which is 
do you want 
 yeah yeah 
 fresh fresh with the
 
yeah what ' s that many of the 
 the wall
this is two feet uh six hundred
 
yeah
six hundred 
 six hundred by by six and a half feet
 
six hundred seventy 
six six hundred seventy centimetre
 
oh six hundred one word 
 six hundred millimetre
 
yeah 
so it ' s six hundred 
six and a half it ' s uh no
yeah computer table computer desk with a shelf
 
right
 so the basically there ' s sort of two kinds of uh
repairs uh that have to be made uhm uh calvin one is to the windows
 and the other is uh you know doing something in that room there 
 yeah 
 the windows 
yeah
remove that
how about the ti timber panel here
 
oh these are great these are fine 
 what ' s 
what ' s what are they
 
these are they are okay they are fine 
they are fine
so i think i think for for this one what we can do is uh we
will mea measure the size of the windows and then uh got give you a
quotation on that
 
right 
so uh you can you can take the quotation to ask the the
management company to repair it for you or
 otherwise you can do it probably you you can claim the money back from
the management
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm 
uh normally you ' ll ask the the management company to to do
it for you
 
uhm 
if not you can do it and claim back the
money from management 
yeah you can talk to them to see which which 
method they want to use yeah
for so at the moment i can measure the the size of the windows
 and uh and and take note on it
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm 
it ' s really stain
them them the contractor should should protect the glasses
 before they they clean the towers
 otherwise it ' ll it will 
happen all the time 
because the acid they use is uh is acidic
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm 
so the size of the this uhm three hundred and seven 
seventy wide and uh this one is hundred and twenty centimetre 
 
oh thanks
so it ' s three seventy one hundred and twenty yeah
 
 uhm 
uhm 
and the
before they they replace the window they have
to take out the one word here 
yeah they have to take out the one word 
 and then and then remove the glass and then 
they they put back the the new glass and then they have to reseize 
 the the window back again yeah
do we have any other problems oh yeah
how about the hinges
is it okay
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
okay let ' s do 
 
 how about the lots of window here 
and the windows here
this is uh the fixed window
 
uhm 
uhm it ' s
i ' ll check whether they can they can do it inside 
 or they have to do it from the outside 
for these are fixed window they they can do it inside 
and so they don't have to to make a scarf holding outside
so uh will be cheaper on that yeah 
all windows here uh they can they can replace it from the inside
 yeah 
so you save a lot on that
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
the the size of the of the fixed window is nine hundred
and twenty by one meter two hundred 
that ' s nine hundred and twenty by so all all
all the window height are the same
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm 
one hundred and twenty and this movable
window is three fifty by what hundred and twenty 
so this one is movable
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
three fifty 
three three hundred and forty yeah 
 
 uhm uhm 
that window okay 
okay
 
i think there ' s three windows here i think as well yup 
yes there ' s three windows here
for this one yeah you can you can
yeah again you can you can do it from inside
 
uhm 
so this is fixed
 
uhm uhm 
this is oh this is movable
 that ' s good yeah you can you
otherwise if this is fixed then you you can't
replace this one 
yeah you can't do it 
okay
this is the size here
it ' s six hundred and thirty time hundred
and twenty
yeah they are the same height
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
six hundred and twenty 
six twenty
okay this is fixed
this one is like that and then this one 
and this one is four hundred and sixty
 
uhm 
four sixty 
this this is this is big right this is six seven
seven hundred
 normal normally we we don't do uhm that those
wide for uh for a movable window because the hinges will not
be as sufficient
 
 uhm uhm 
 right 
uhm 
oh yeah sorry yup yup yup
that one is seven hundred and then this is the smallest one
 
uhm 
two hundred and seventy 
two seventy yeah
they got still got uh two glasses in the maid ' s room
 
uhm </x?
there ' s two
 
yeah that ' s right yup 
it ' s three hundred times three hundred
that ' s three hundred times three hundred
this one is different
 they got the air conditioner on the top 
 
so it ' s uh smaller
 
 uhm 
 right 
 smaller 
right 
 one word thirty times this one 
seven ninety
 
uhm uhm 
so si si seven ninety of three hundred and three
hundred 
yeah and this one is in the maid ' s room
 
 yeah 
right 
even living master bedroom yeah
 
alright
so what would you what would you guess speed uh sort of
what would you guess speed of the cost yeah
yeah 
 the cost 
yeah
 
alright you can give me just a sort of 
uh uh estimation on that 
 
 general estimate yeah on this project
 yeah 
uhm we have to consider 
 
 i mean you just need an initial estimate doesn't
have to be exact it i mean uhm if you decide here 
 yeah
so you have to consider
first of all labour to remove all the existing windows
 
right 
and then have to consider the the material cost for the
for the glass
 
right 
and then the labour cost for the replacement of the 
the glass
so uhm i ' ll guess the approximately cost for for the whole
job is around 
let me let me calculate it a long pause 
let me do calculate it
it ' s around five thousand roughly yeah oh 
upper 
 
 right 
 five thousand yes that ' s quite reason 
yeah
around five thousand dollars for the whole job 
two words 
 
 yeah quite i know quite reasonable 
uhm 
 yeah 
yeah and uhm and the time require for replacing the windows is
approximately uh three days but uh you can ask them to to cut the uh the
the glass the size first because you have normally you have
to wait for the the the glass for for one or two days
 yeah so uhm in order not to uh disturb too too long
 then you ask the contractor to to cut the
size cut the glass first and then they can came in the same day to 
to remove it and then will fix it
 
 yeah 
 right 
 i see right 
 right 
 yeah 
 yeah 
well i would like you i like you i like your company to do the
job if possible 
so uhm uh perhaps i can ask my assistant michelle or
something to uh per perhaps i can ask michelle my assistant to
contact the to contact the uh management company 
 and then negotiate with her 
what what did she have to do in order to negotiate with them 
 yes 
 oh yeah yeah uh yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
uhm they just ask she she has to and i ask tell them the
situation
 
uhm 
and then uh you do you have any any photographs taken
during when when they do the external wall
 
 no i i reported it to the company 
 finished 
oh the the company already knew that 
 
 yeah at the time i reported it uh on the phone on
the phone and i saw that in defact yeah 
 oh de defeat defect defect defect what
yeah
so uh
 
they not sell that form on record
 they said couple months ago happen a few months
ago when they were doing the building and i contact to
them even when the one word you know when the 
one word was up 
 oh i see 
 doing the buildings 
yup uhm for that i can give you a formal quotation on that 
 so uh and then probably uh michelle can talk to the management
 if they agree or the contractor agree on that on the on
the cost then then we can proceed with the uh 
with replacement works
 yeah otherwise they may they may ask the the uh
external wall contractor to to do it instead without any 
you don't have to pay any any money 
on that 
 
 right 
 right 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 right 
 yeah 
but i rather i rather your company do that anyway so 
yeah
because i know i know you ' ll much more
careful several words may cause uhm it
may cause more damage 
 so 
 yeah then then other 
 yeah 
there ' s few things you have to uh uh remind that is when they
do the replacement make sure that the ceiling they they do it probably 
 
otherwise water will come through from from the uh
the gaps
 
 yes 
 uhm 
uhm 
yeah
but yeah yeah
 
so the ot the other job was this this is for me actually
it ' s it ' s uhm taking out taking out this bed and then uh
replacing it with uhm with a computer table here and some book shelves uhm
yeah uhm one thing i notice that uh when you do the shelf you
have to be careful because you ' ve got the uh electrical uh meter here 
 uh yeah a shoot box we call it 
 yeah
so uhm for the shelf uh at the up upper part uh i think we we we
do it uh narrower so then we calls 
 
 yes right 
 yeah 
 yeah 
uhm or could you could you put the box or something
there become up maybe or 
 yeah but but sometime you have have it open it
 so you need you need to provide space for that
 
 yeah 
right
okay right 
yeah
so probably you can have the desk like uh six hundred desk 
 at the lower part and then have a book shelf
on upper part 
the shelve won't come up to to here to the six hundred wide 
 so probably uh three hundred yeah
three hundred wide
uh it ' s three hundred and thirty so it ' s just enough 
good enough for a four size paper or book so you can have a a
book shelf on the upper part 
yeah
so uhm what what kind of material you you want is 
you want it to be uh timber or plastic 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 i think just basic quite quite simple 
quite simple
 
uhm perhaps even you may be get something from the kl or 
 some other other i mean i think uh this could be done quite
simply
i ' m i ' ll i just think uh i need the uh the walls painted and
then uhm uh just a simple arrangement
it could be just you know just it looks quite nice and
then space for computer chair and uh space for computer and
 then but i also need powerpoint powerpoint put in 
 so 
 or from the uk 
 okay 
 com 
 yeah powerpoint 
 yeah uhm broadband 
 
 so what right 
and then i mean the uh uh telephone circuit 
 powerpoint and then uh circuit for the
broadband
 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm 
yeah so uh
uh i don't i i won't suggest you to to buy from the one
word because the they they use uh the the
medium one word board instead of
using one word uh pinewood 
 and their their like the shelf won't last long 
most of the time two years specially
 when when the uh atmosphere in a house is like sometimes humid 
 sometimes is dry then then uh the the the shelf
will will damage or or or very very soon 
yeah 
so uh i i think better to buy from other place if you 
want to buy the one word 
so uh so you have to remove this on that
 dress 
do you do you need any any drawers or or or 
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 it could be yeah
the size could be drawers down
draw here at the bottom perhaps yeah 
 at the 
the drawers down to the bottom okay
how how big is your uh hard hard hard disk
because i when i when i design the the computer desk i have to
consider where to put put your hard disk if it ' s sometimes
if people will use very big hard disk as uh the the cpu yeah 
 
 uhm 
 oh you mean you mean the cpu yeah 
uhm oh i think it ' s uh it ' s probably around that size
around that size so about five hundred
 and 
 
 yeah uhm 
 uhm which it think uh that size at the 
most 
 yeah five and five fifty 
 
 i think it ' s a normal size yeah 
yeah it ' s the normal size what
 
yeah i guess so 
 yes because nowadays they have very very slim
very small one
 
right yeah 
 so very small cpu
 
right right
but i can let you know about that later on 
 yeah yeah yeah
do you want to uh one word top because
because some people uh they they want the one word top
it ' s more durable but it will be more expensive
 
right 
yeah if you you use one word uh worktop
 
what is what is one word 
 one word uh is similar to to use uh in
the kitchen
 some sometimes you use use in the 
kitchen top 
 
 yeah yeah 
 i know 
no i think just uh two words would be okay
 two words 
 
yeah 
so it ' s it ' s two words 
how about the the chairs you want to you want to buy it or or from
from lanmaxs uh polsh or or i think it
it ' s cheaper to buy it from from those companies because 
they have sales discounts uh nowadays 
 
 uh 
 okay 
 yup yup yup right 
right
