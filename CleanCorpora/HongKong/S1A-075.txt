 
""
so what are you doing now 
""
""
i  ' m waiting for the other job actually
 
""
uhm 
""
""
because uh mainly i  i wish to work on my profession
 
""
yeah 
""
""
and
""
i mean i don't care work in like computer system operation
""
or office clerk
""
work in a bank
""
i mean i could handle it
""
but    
""
i don't want to do that kind of jobs
""
  i mean  it  ' s not my profession
""
so as i  ' m looking for this kind of job and you know hong kong in
this  fields of development is not that well
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
uhm
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
that  ' s true
""
yeah 
""
""
so
""
most of them
""
most of the job that is base on uhm  how to say that uhm  it  ' s
temporary
 
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
it  ' s short contract
""
short term things
""
yeah
""
uhm
""
how do you find out about them
""
i mean how do you find out about jobs
""
and contracts
""
and 
""
""
sometimes it  ' s   from 
 
""
 i mean for   for for a computer  operator you look
into the newspaper and you see    advertisements
""
but do you  
""
""
 newspaper and uh   you know here  ' s got uhm 
arts centre
""
or you could say it  ' s arts resources and information library 
 in  hong kong
 
""
 uh  
""
oh
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
so you could find a lot of information there
 
""
yeah 
""
""
and they they will be like an  an agent for you
""
  if you  ' re an  artist    
""
just fill in a form
""
and they like the a job agent    
""
they find out some job that in related to art    
""
related to your  one word 
""
they would call you
""
uh
""
let  ' s go to see that    
""
and they interview
""
and then
 
""
 yeah
""
i see  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
 uh
""
uh  
""
yeah
""
that  ' s good
""
it  ' s useful to have a central place like that
""
because  otherwise it  ' s difficult finding out about things
here 
""
""
yeah
 
""

""
""

no
""
that  ' s right
""
he he had left to live in england
""
didn't he
""
  he  left to live in london 
""
""
 uhm  
""
he became so famous in uh in england
""
much much more than in hong kong
 
""
really 
""
""
yeah
""
yeah
 
""
it  ' s a bit like timothy mo 
""
""
yeah
 
""
remember timothy mo
""
the writer 
""
he  ' s  a lot older
""
timothy mo
""
he wrote uhm  sweet and sour
""
uh  he he was  one word  from hong kong
""
and then he went  to live in england  ver  a long time
ago
""
and he  ' s better much better known in england as a hong kong 
writer
""
or person
""
than he is in hong kong 
""
""
and he he  ' s write in english or
 
""
yeah
""
he writes in english
""
that  ' s right
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
huh huh
 
""
but he write  hhis
""
i  i haven't read any of his books
""
my wife read has read his books
""
and  the first one was about hong kong
""
aspects of hong kong 
""
but that was about twenty years ago
""
 three words  and 
""
yeah
""
but this this edward lam
""
he
""
i recorded him once
""
i was trying to get him to  to agree  that i could his 
his interview on the radio he gave once
""
about three years ago
""
about one of his plays
""
and uh  i was chasing him for a long time
""
and all of a sudden
""
he  ' s he phoned me up one day
""
from the airport
""
he was going back to england
""
he lives  laughs  in england
""
and we spoke for a half an hour
""
and then he disappeared again
""
 two words 
""
finished
""
gone 
""
""
but uh
""
is it  he play in english
""
i mean
 
""
i can't remember what it was
""
uhm  it was one of it was one of his very homoerotic plays 
""
this is about three years ago
""
i think
""
two to three years ago 
""
""
is it uh  how to lovely man they  doesn't love you 
  
""
four scene and a male changing room
 
""
 i tell you what  
""
that  ' s right
""
the male   changing 
""
that  ' s right
""
he  w  he was talking about the male changing room 
""
yeah
""
that  ' s right
""
i remember that topic 
""
""
 uh  
""
yeah
 
""
and he was the interviewer was asking him about this and you know
""
are you just copying western ideas and  controversy and 
all the rest of it
""
he said oh no not not really
""
uh  and he was talking about 
""
i don't think he talked about why he  ' s leaving
""
why he left hong kong
""
i  ' m not quite sure why 
""
he  ' s 
""
yeah
""
he  ' s gone to live in england
""
so it seems 
""
""
so he he  ' s living in england right now
""
  he  ' s staying 
 
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
yeah
""
i had his address once cos i sent him a fax asking him to send to
fill in this form
""
he never replied  laughs 
""
that  ' s why he  three words 
""
he has an address in england 
""
and i faxed him in england
""
and then i heard nothing
""
and then one day i was sitting in the office he rang me up in the
morning and he was ringing up from the airport
""
he he  ' d been to hong kong for a visit and he  ' s going off again
""
and uh  laughs     
""
and anyway
""
i said i said i  ' d send you another one
""
he said yeah yeah and nothing ever happened  laughs  
""
yeah
""
that  ' s why he left the zuni 
""
zuni
""
zuni
""
zuni 
""
zuni whatever it is 
""
but they  ' re they  ' re quite a controversial company
""
aren't they
""
zuni
""
sometimes
""
i remember  some time earlier this year there was something
about the uh the urban council and the grant from the urban council 
""
they couldn't get the money to go to europe to do something
""
i think
""
uh
""
but i  two words  happen to that 
""
""
 uhm  
""
it  ' s so difficult to ask for a fund actually    
from the government that you  you want to  po  uh perform
""
not in hong kong
 
""
 yeah  
""
uhm 
""
""
because you know the fund in  our  i mean they got a
lot of uh uhm  terms and condition basically under that uh uhm  that
fund so you have to  match a lot of things
 
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
when you got that money
 
""
yeah
""
uhm 
""
""
i quite i i mean i can't say or you can't say oh this this is
that  ' s so difficult to to get the money because you know i  find it so
easy
""
i haven't got any problem at all to get the funding from  from
the government    
""
but i could say luckily it  ' s because i match    
the requirement
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah
""
yeah
""
yeah  
""
yeah
""
is that cos you read them  you read the requirements carefully
""
""
""
yes
""
that  ' s why
 
""
yeah yeah it  ' s the same like in well it  ' s the same in education
to some extent
""
if you if you put in to do  some research of some kind if you
look at the  the sort of the good points and the bad points and you find
out what it is the  the committee like
""
uhm it  ' s not it  ' s not not always easy to tell because they have
conditions
""
often they  they are very vague  conditions so  you have
to ask somebody what what this means
""
to  tell 
""
you know something like that
""
oh
""
yeah
""
okay
""
then you write it
""
you know to sort of suit their condition
""
then you can  sometime well usually in fact  get it 
""
the problem is it  ' s quite a it  ' s quite a  a full time job
 ch   laughs  chasing get some money
""
and  one word  this and the other 
""
""
huh huh
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
many blokes looking for this uh uhm position  advertise 
   
""
to  try 
""
okay
""
yeah
""
focusing on uhm this job and really looking for  the grants and
money because yeah i mean
""
i don't know whether in  the other country i mean like in
england and other countries is is the same or not but looking for fund 
   or asking for for fund in hong kong
""
no matter they are in you know uhm government from government from
jockey club or from   others commercial   is not that 
easy
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah
""
yeah
""
yeah  
""
uhm
""
yeah
""
i don't know in britain
""
i i i know it goes up and down
""
it  ' s always  the people in the arts say
""
there isn't enough  funding
""
and 
""
i think recently they  ' ve made it more competitive
""
so that  instead of having  say three or four
""
instead of funding three or four  opera companies
""
for example
""
they said we  ' ll we  ' ll fund two
""
so you must compete somehow uh between you
""
to
""
you know we  ' ll  we  ' ll do one or two
""
but not not all four
""
and the same with orchestras
""
for example
""
in london
""
and that  ' s  that  ' s the sort of uhm  the very high profile
 arts
""
i suppose
""
you know the orchestras
""
the the uhm  the opera
""
the that sort of thing
""
uh  i just don't know
""
i mean 
""
operas are very expensive thing
""
and that always seems to be uh in problems
""
and the orchestras to some extent
""
there  ' s lots of  small theatres
""
but they they tend to be 
""
a bit like yourself
""
i suppose
""
you know
""
 sh  to do short term work and  semi-professional and
and doing a bit at a time 
""
it  ' s very it  ' s very difficult to say 
""
and there is of course to the whole commercial side in britain
""
she may not be here
""
you know the sort of andrew lloyd webber  stuff
""
no doubt that  that is 
""
that  ' s a very good money earner
""
uh  whether you like it or  four words  
laughs 
""
it  ' s i mean that  ' s  that was very definitely the the
nineteen eighties
""
all that sort of stuff
""
lloyd webber type shows
""
we were very very we  ' re  selling  the seventy business
""
seventies and eighties
""
and that  ' s become an art form almost
""
you know  that sort of  musical type shows
""
uh 
""
but i just
""
i mean i i only go to england for about six weeks a year
""
and i never really get into it
""
very much
""
i do collect play bills
""
and my wife collects the the little bills in it
""
the the plays
""
and
""
certainly a year or two ago
""
there are much  there are fewer of those around
""
usually we pick them up from libraries and from you know various
places
""
and they almost stopped about two years ago
""
when  sort of the economic situation is very bad
""
uh  what is like now
""
i don't know
""
i think it depends very much from place to place
""
i mean i guess in london it  ' s an awful lot  of of things
going on
""
and in some of the bigger cities
""
and i come from manchester
""
and there  ' s lot there  ' s a lot going on there
""
sort of you know  local groups
""
but the more you get out into the country
""
my guess is you know  is less of everything
""
you know sort of cultural  art sense  
 
""
yeah 
""
are you hopeful you  ' ll get a job in the  in the  in the
new year 
""
""
uh
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
i really do hope so
 
""
uhm 
""
""
because that job uhm  is uhm  it  ' s so match a lot of
things
""
match my  ca  uh uhm  profession
""
my  uh character    
""
personality
""
and uhm i i  i met a lot of people and i i actually i i have
been  work for them   one  
""
but not in this position    
""
the other position    
""
so you could you could say
""
or or you  coul 
""
yeah
""
you could say
""
before i was  uh an assistant
""
and now they  ' re now looking for a manager  group 
""
so uh i don't know whether i could  you could say promote
""
or get in there again    
""
but in a higher position    
""
because most of the job
""
and most of the uh uh uhm  the duties
""
that i i already have  work     
""
when i was at that position
""
so i don't know whether i could
""
because
""
you know in these couple of days
""
uh so many christmas party that
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
""
$z laughs  yeah
""
yeah
""
i just stay out 
$a laughs 
""
you know i said i was going to go to the uhm  the government
information services building there
""
i took some tapes
""
i was taping an earlier party
""
i didn't realize
""
i said
""
well    
""
i said
""
well
""
look
""
i  ' ll  i  ' ll come a bit later in the afternoon
""
so
""
we  ' ll probably close early today    
""
i thought they close at four o'clock
""
or something like that
""
i said i  ' ll  only be about  four o'clock
""
so    
""
i went there early
""
they were having a party  laughs 
""
  yes 
""
it  ' s true 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 huh  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
like uh
""
because  laughs  i  ' ve i  ' ve been  to lots of school
   
""
four
""
so i  ' ve been invited to in difference uh  secondary school
""
to join the christmas party    
""
and uh i said i saw a lot of people there    
""
so many colleagues that i work with  in the in the school 
  
""
they said
""
yeah
""
you you match this post
""
so we wish you you got that
""
but
""
i mean uhm there  ' s some of the uhm the other thing is that  uh
i i couldn't uh say uhm hundred percent confident
""
i mean i  ' m confident on the things that i already have done 
  
""
uh so many peoples i  ' ms  i know  the system
""
and i will be much familiar than than a new person   
""
something  like that
""
but  they  ' re looking for
""
actually they are looking for a a guy
""
that he got to have the  art sense 
""
uhm specially on uh fine art and visual art    
""
but i  ' m not  uh basic  relating
""
that  ' s why    
""
i train from theatre    
""
i mean of course basically we got the same idea
""
we have we still have to study  art history
""
arts development
""
we still have to learn
""
oh
""
how  ' s to find answer
""
how  ' s to the the colours
""
and what kind of things they style    
""
but it  ' s just so briefly
""
just very basic    
""
but not like the other  personal     
""
and on the other hand it  ' s   uh 
 
""
 uhm
""
uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
 when you say   it  ' s nice it  ' s nice to have a
 a part of the job you don't know
""
so you can  maybe learn about it 
""
""
i do hope so
""
  yeah 
""
i do hope it   is  it will be
""
because  after that
""
after i i interview that job 
""
i sit down and that i write it down so detailly
""
so what i could really handle and     got
compromise
""
what i couldn't
""
and i also try to uhm propose the other the other new guy to sit
for
""
because
""
you know
""
as i did work for so many artist in hong kong
""
and so many fine art artist    
""
they  ' re much  uh uhm  uh unemploy than than i am
""
it  ' s because
""
oh
""
they want they don't want to do that
 
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
they want much more freedom
 
""
yeah
""
uhm 
""
""
so perhaps
""
uh they they will not interested on that position   
""
""
 for uh  for one need to art strength
""
it  ' s just to to be a a a relationship coordinator
""
something like that
""
  it  ' s  not really on my field
""
perhaps they will refuse the job 
""
i really don't know
 
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah   
""
yeah
""
that is sort sort of balancing between having  just to do some
 one word  parts of the job
""
and you know not covering into the others
""
but i think i mean if  it  ' s it  ' s good to to have a job where
 you  ' re learning something
""
and if you  ' re if you  ' re just going what you already do
""
it  ' s you know  a fairly long pause 
 
""
do you live on this side
""
do you live on hong kong 
""
""

it  ' s the week after christmas
""
starting on the second of january
""
well
""
just four days in fact 
""
and then we have three weeks for examinations 
""
and then we break for chinese new year for two weeks
""
and then we start again 
""
some time in february
""
 exactly  when
""
tenth of february
""
something like that
""
it  ' s very bitty
""
it  ' s very sort of bitty
""
a week week here a week there
""
week something else
""
and uh 
""
still
""
so
""
one of those things
""
uhm 
""
anyway
""
about your production
""
about your  little prince
""
uhm  you showed me a video last time 
""
""
yeah
 
""
and i guess the question was whether we could have a copy of the
video
""
or the copy the script 
""
maybe
""
if you  ' re   going to ask your  
""
""
 uh the copy   of the script will be uh  easier
   
""
than the copy of the video
 
""
 yeah  
""
okay 
""
""
actually
 
""
yes
""
the script is what is important
""
you know it  ' s the the language in the script 
""
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
that  ' s right
 
""
yeah
""
so you said you  ' re going to talk to your committee 
""
""
i i i been talk to them
 
""
yeah 
""
""
uh thing is uhm  because  the  the script
""
the copy of the script is not uhm in my hand    
""
but i will fax it to you    
""
after uh christmas    
""
twenty six or twenty seventh
""
  then uh 
 
""
 uh
""
yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
put it in in the in the new year will be okay
""
you know
""
from  from the beginning of january
""
cause uh  it  ' ll probably safer to do it
""
uhm 
""
""
to safer to do it on
 
""
when when we start in the 
""
actually i  ' ll tell you what
""
you could 
""
""
let me write it down
 
""
the  re  reason i say safer is because if  if we  ' re
not in the office
""
sometimes things get lost
""
uhm  this  where we met in my office
""
that  ' s not the english department
""
that  ' s just a part of  the polytechnic
""
the english department is quite a way away
""
and sometimes things get go missing
""
between you know
""
what you could do actually
""
you could you could see you could fax it to my house
""
cause i  ' ve got a fax at home
""
that would be safer 
""
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
it  ' ll be better
 
""
yeah
""
safer   a fairly long pause 
""
""
yeah
""
it  ' s just  a few words   a fairly long
pause 
 
""
that  ' s safer 
""
""
seven two one nine
""
seven nine nine
 
""
yeah
""
that  ' s right 
""
""
uh what time
""
i mean what day should i  should i fax to you
 
""
well
""
any any day will be okay there
""
because that  ' s i mean that  ' s in my house
""
so  i mean in my flat
""
there  ' s no  there  ' s no problem
""
the problem sometimes in the polytechnic is
""
you know the internal mailing
""
it starts
""
but it doesn't arrive the other place
""
for one reason or another
""
cause uh 
""
""
so this is also i i mean
""
i i i i  i understood it  ' s because sometime when i call you
""
and uh  they they pass me a lot of
""
pass me through in difference line
 
""
yeah
""
that  ' s right
""
when when when you started to call
""
well in the summer when when somebody contacted you
""
a lady called sarah contacted you
""
uhm  in the summer
""
and then she left
""
so
""
your message were going different places
""
but my uhm  the office i have is actually a workshop
""
and it  ' s
""
i share it with uhm  a chinese man who
""
we we share the office
""
and we also share the phone    
""
exactly the same line
""
now he doesn't use it all that much now
""
cause he  ' s got his own portable  uh direct extra phone which
he uses 
""
i mean we  ' ve also got this voice thing now
""
it  ' s  you know you can leave a message on the voice
""
uh 
""
""
 huh huh  
""
uh
""
yeah
""
yeah
 
""
yeah
""
that  that usually works
""
but not always  laughs  
$a laughs 
""
for some reason
""
i don't know what it is 
""
""
yeah
 
""
sometimes
""
and
""
the funny thing is
""
they introduced it
""
without telling anybody how it  ' s going to work
""
so one day the it would ring ring
""
nothing ring
""
you pick it up
""
nothing happen
""
and then this  one word  go on for about two
days
""
and then we got a memo
""
saying this is how you use the voice thing
""
you you pick it up
""
you dial the number
""
and you enter a number
""
and then you can hear your messages 
""
and that was wrong
""
and they got the number on their  cir 
""
the the following day
""
another memo came up
""
and that  ' s wrong number
""
use this number
""
uhm  and then you could do this and the other
""
and it seems to be more or less working now
""
but uh  you  ' d never tell  laughs 
""
 those  things 
""
""
the thing is that i  ' m i  ' m just thinking
""
 one word  is you say you want a copy
""
uhm actually
""
we want to know uhm  what uh uh uh you will use  for
 
""
yeah
""
what we  ' re going to do with it 
""
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
what will do with on on on on the video
 
""
right
""
well 
""
and the  vi  the video is not so important except that it
gives the whole context for what  for what goes on
""
uhm i think i mentioned briefly
""
what what we do is we type all the  we type all the various
texts into a computer
""
into a computer file format
""
and then we can search through to see what words go with what
other words
""
uh  i mean you  you may or may not know about language
""
in the sense that some words are much more frequent than others
""
and some words go together
""
very frequently
""
and other words never go together
""
very frequently
""
and what we do is
""
we look
""
we have these different kind
""
different categories of writing
""
for example
""
uhm  we have student examinations
""
student essays
""
uh business letters
""
uh social letters
""
you know letters to family and friends 
""
uh then is lots of different kinds of  uh published writing
""
like magazines and newspapers and books and articles
""
and that sort of things
""
uhm  we have  the other category
""
the other major category is a slot called creative
""
in a sense that it is not  like business
""
not writing about something
""
or ordering something
""
or setting up a report
""
or arguing a case
""
something like that
""
it  ' s just some creative use of language
""
when you  ' re telling a story
""
when you  ' re  writing a poem
""
or you  ' re  doing this sort of thing
""
and  your theatre work comes in that creative  side
""
uh in that creative area
""
and it  ' s one of the very few things we can find
""
in english
""
uhm by a local person
""
or that  ' s and you know
""
edited all for by a local person in some way
""
they  ' re very very
""
i mentioned timothy mo earlier on
""
uhm but he  ' s not really a local person anymore
""
cause he left hong kong  many years ago to 
""
 where 
""
not really
""
and there are very few hong kong authors
""
or hong kong writers
""
who use english  for any length
""
so what we  ' ll do is
""
we  ' ll look and see
""
we get it all into a  sort of  computer file
""
then we can search to see what sort of patterns of words
""
people are using to describe things to uhm 
""
yeah
""
to describe and to do all sorts of things with language
""
and we see how different kinds of texts differ
""
you know as you can imagine a business letter  ' s very different
from a social letter
""
it  ' s very different from a  story or a poem
""
and that  ' s very different from an academic paper
""
you know something  an article on chemical theory
""
or  somehow  very different
""
the  writing  style
""
which is written in words as we used
""
uhm  uh and all that sort of thing
""
and that  ' s what we  ' re doing
""
but we  ' re actually doing it
""
not so much  within  hong kong in a sense
""
of looking at just the english in hong kong
""
we  ' re doing it in about fifteen different countries
""
fifteen to twenty different countries
""
where english is used
""
and each country is collecting the same  set of categories
""
same kinds of texts
""
uh  so that we can see
""
how english is changing
""
or how it  ' s developing in different parts of the world
""
cause it  ' s developing differently in different parts of the
world
""
uhm  and that  ' s what we  ' re doing
""
uh  at the moment
""
we  ' re just finishing off
""
getting all the data
""
collecting all the data
""
and then some time next year
""
we  ' ll start some analysis
""
of the data
""
firstly the hong kong data
""
and then the international  comparison  of the data
""
uh  but that will be some time next year
""
or may even be the year after
""
cause it takes a long long time to to get it all together
""
each country is trying to get a million words
""
and a million words is a lot of words to  to get
""
uhm  it  ' s we  ' ve been doing it for three or four years now
""
getting the stuff
""
getting the data 
""
so
""
uhm  i don't know the answer to your question  laughs
""
 
""
""
uh
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
uhm 
""
uh s  actually
""
uhm you you bring out the memory
""
of what you  gave me     before
""
the script of description
 
""
 yeah  
""
that  ' s right
""
yeah 
""
""
what  ' s the project is like
""
so this is why i ask uhm uh what what you  ' re going to use
""
for the for the uh for the video
 
""
yeah 
""
""
it  ' s because uhm  our group
""
uh really  agrees to give you uh as  much as we could 
  
""
i mean now matter you want the script
""
no matter you want video
""
or even though photo photos uh portfolio    
""
we could we could it to you
""
because as we are developing
""
and uh so many people ask this before    
""
and
""
we we  at first we we want to find out
""
oh
""
you you want to use for  which part
""
or how are you going to use it
""
we just just want want it to to keep in your file   
""
""
or you really uh uhm  need it
""
i mean i give you uh uh the other  exboun  samples
""
so this is right    
""
you check everything
""
that  we are open    
""
but we want to be secure
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
yeah
""
sure
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah
""
uhm s  one of the group in hong kong
""
they always ask me to go to audition
""
and every audition
""
they will record my sound    
""
and they will uhm 
""
i mean i  ' m talking about the film dubbing    
""
so you know
""
as as they want you to to do uh some dubbing like  japanese
animation    
""
or some of the chinese english animation
""
so
""
they they need a chinese uh uhm narrator
""
something like that    
""
to to use it
""
to translate it
""
and and to dub and dub it into the chinese version
""
but every time this group ask us to go to  uhm his uh studio
""
to to record a tape
""
to have audition
""
but every time they will say
""
oh
""
uhm you  ' re not the right person that we  ' re looking for
""
let  ' s see next time    
""
but somebody told me
""
somebody told our group
""
that our voice
""
i mean my voice and  the other artist of my group
""
that their voice have use
 
""
 uh
""
yes
""
yeah  
""
 yeah
""
yeah
""
yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
really
""
yeah
""
you know i  ' ve i  ' ve heard this with companies
""
they they  the strategy with some some large companies use
""
when they they don't know what to do about something
""
they they set up 
""
they advertise the position
""
a job
""
to do something
""
and then they interview people
""
and they ask them
""
you know what  what if you have this job
""
you want to do this particular task
""
you know you  ' ve got you  ' ve got any ideas
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
you know
""
cause  when you go for interview
""
you  ' re very keen
""
you give all your ideas
""
this that and the other
""
  so and then 
""
that  ' s that  ' s right
""
then they say
""
sorry
""
you didn't get the job
""
you know
""
uhm this that and the other
""
and then
""
next thing you know they  ' re actually using that  idea
""
that  ' s uh
""
i  ' ve heard that     one word 
before  
""
""
 and they use your idea  
""
 yeah  
""
i mean of course or uh uh  if you are not working on this
""
and you you really
""
i mean i i don't care whether you you you use my voice or not
   
""
but at least you have to tell me    
""
or
""
i mean
""
on the other side that
""
you have to pay us back
""
if you  ' re commercial    
""
and this is
""
i mean it  ' s very impolite and very uhm
""
i mean not only impolite
""
but it  ' s a it  ' s a way of uhm not having responsibilities 
  
""
and not that they they do not have the uhm professional attitude
""
then you it  ' s just like what i think
""
this kind of thing is equal to uhm break the uhm the copyright
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm
""
yeah  
""
 uhm
""
yeah  
""
that  ' s right
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
because you use our voice
""
  you  use the company   
""
and  you said no to us
""
but you use our our work
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm
""
that  ' s right  
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
and the   other 
 
""
 yes  
""
sorry about that 
""
""
yeah
""
you see
""
and and the other group is also like this
""
they ask  you to do a lot of things
""
and after that they they haven't say  anything to us
""
they just give us the money    
""
and they
""
because one of my group member
""
he  ' s little  one word 
""
so sometime he will he will uhm work with for the theatre field
""
and they they take some photograph
""
and we we mention that you
""
apart from you paying us the money
""
you have to
""
this is the copyright that we have to keep    
""
this is is our thought
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
yeah
""
  so  
""
""
 yeah  
""
but they they took our uh uh uh uhm what  do you call 
copyright to sold other people
""
and not  crediting  us    
""
i mean
""
you know uhm  i always say that this is not we are short
temper
""
or we are you know uh uhm likes uh bargaining something
""
but it  ' s the right    
""
if if we are working on this field
""
we have to protect ourselves at least     on 
copyright
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
yeah
""
oh
""
yes
""
i mean i agree with you entirely
""
yeah
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah
""
so uhm there  ' s there  ' s so many group they they they doing this
 kind of nasty behaviour   
""
so  i mean
""
we i mean as i uhm speak to my group
""
they said it
""
yeah
""
yeah
""
of course
""
we are so welcome to do that other people do that   
""
""
but
""
we have to be very careful    
""
and not any others people doing  that kind of thing  
 
""
so i mean  as i  ' m i thinking about
""
oh
""
as i say that
""
your group is going to  uh analysis
""
or to group uhm difference  form of english usage  
 
""
uh so
""
i think uh if  if i give you  a script
""
then uh say the copyrights belongs to  quartet production 
   and  and me
""
and then uh you give me the uhm  testimonial or  re 
reference letter
""
oh
""
that  ' s that  ' s alright    
""
but if you if you want to uh have the video
""
i mean i i would say
""
oh
""
what are you going to use it for    
""
or
""
you if if you demonstrate on
""
you know
""
it  ' s like
""
ok
""
let me  have some  visual uh uh support
 
""
 yeah
""
yeah  
""
 uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
  yeah 
""
uhm uhm
""
yeah
""
it  ' s actually very difficult to say what we use the video for
""
because the  the the category of creative  actually comes
under written
""
as opposed to spoken in form
""
uh  i mean i i simply don't know what  to things which
are video  borne 
""
for example
""
things we videoed off the television
""
for example
""
reading the news
""
or
""
things like the newsline programme
""
or things like that
""
that  ' s  that  ' s fairly straight forward
""
uhm  i  i  ' m honestly not sure
""
because  this this sort of project
""
this sort of work goes back about twenty-five or thirty years
""
started in uh 
""
for the spoken  language
""
it started very much in london
""
university of london
""
and they made lots of tape recordings
""
and then they they transcribed it all out
""
uhm  but the the the actual sound was never available
""
for other researchers to listen to
""
so they have to depend on  how well it been  trans 
you know transcribed
