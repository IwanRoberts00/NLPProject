uhm uh thank you doctor chan i first of all i i must thank you all for inviting me to attend this uh very important open forum uhm probably uh ever since i have taken up the directorship in this polytechnic i have highlighted one very important ingredient to the way i run this institution is to improve and enhance the channel of communication and i i think this is very important now especially when we are introducing such a important uhm structural change in the in the institutions so i i do want to make every member of staff in the institution both academic and equivalent administrative to have a clear understanding what we are doing so there ' s no misunderstanding whatsoever now uh i i think this provides a good opportunity for us to try to explain to you some of the query you may have and from then on to see uhm how we can make you feel comfortable about the whole thing uh well i believe the my my open letter to all members of staff have outlined the background and the reason of doing so which i don't want to repeat again not to waste your time but one thing i want to emphasize is that ever since we have uh received the letter from uptc indicating the the government ' s concern of of uh implementation of pater salary they believe that one principle must be upheld and that is that uh teacher teaching similar courses at the same level should be awarded the same well this ' s a very important concept of equity because  or according to our original proposal to the government hoping that all members of our staff will be transferred over to be to have university salary now base on that the government cannot accept it based on one principle the principle of what what i just mentioned and also it ' s a practical difficulties because in our in our in our staff structure there may be staff who are teaching sub degrees as first degrees with different ratios or proportions so there could be staff teaching mainly sub degrees and if they are given the so called university salary that means the government will have a difficult time in future answering to any possible request from vtc so called technical college they are essentially teaching sub degrees for similar treatment because they can always quote polytechnic examples that because our staff who are teaching primarily sub degrees are given university salary then technical college could claim for the same treatment and this is a very serious snow balling effect and the government can definitely not in the position support that so government got to be firm on on on this equity and uh so we have no alternative but to accept it or reject it now if we one-word reject the total proposal of pater salary then you can you can foresee that the future prospect of further development of this polytechnic in comparison with that of city polytechnic baptist and ling nan will be in an extremely disadvantageous position so if we have got to accept this parity salary issue then we have got to follow government ' s very stringent criteria and that is total equity that means staff must be engage in teaching degrees must be engaged in teaching degree work and no more in order to enjoy the so called university salary so we were put in such a very difficult position because our our staff is essentially teaching both degrees and sub degrees and it is therefore it is up to us whether we we want to accept government ' s offer or not and we feel that we have we have got to accept the offer and we have got to face the difficult task of how to separate our staff in two groups those who can enjoy parity and those who can't so we have consider various options so the best option we thought is is the first principle is that no member of staff should suffer as a result of this that ' s no detrimental principles are applied therefore we can only regard those we could we have got to  c carry out some kind of screen exercise those who can screen in will enjoy the parity salary  those those who are not successful will remain as what they are doing so that ' s no no issue of you have got to apply for the same job again so those who want to transfer to the so called college or degree studies you have got to apply for to for for consideration if you don't want to go over you don't have to apply for anything at all you will not not suffer so this is a fundamental principle and no one will be uh forced to go uh go down to a lower grade we are not creating a second class one-word  what we are doing is that we create a college as if this is uh another pr or promotion prospect because at present we have got the l to sl to pl  from every promotion exercise there ' s bound to be competitions only a a selective few can can be successful those who apply may not be successful so we are creating another opportunity for transfer as if this is promotion so members all are welcome to apply for transfer those who are successful are lucky good luck to you those who are not successful i ' m not i won't say too bad but you have got second chance next year the year after so that is the principle behind now also we want to ensure that as much consultation as possible therefore uh you appreciate that we have got to keep this strictly confidential before the whole package is is have been followed for  through because leakage or or mess of this kind without the true understanding could be extremely uh detrimental to the morale because people just have rumors around what ' s going on that ' s why the discussion among the senior management  group was conducted in strictly confidential manner without leakage of anything to the to any member of staff including one-word  department and all the way down so the whole thing was structured in such a way that the on the twenty eighth of that day so in the morning i have when this letter was issued out i am meeting the heads of department informing informing heads of department the whole package and then try to discuss with them in the afternoon i have meetings with psas as well as with students because whole the whole idea has no im if effect on student at all because we are not creating two separate colleges students are all students of polytechnic they receive awards on polytechnic nothing will change now following that uh immediately then the key thing of course is is the the is criteria of transfer therefore we have to at first draw up a criteria that will send out to all department heads and division chairman they were asked to consult among themselves came up with the second draft one-word some idea so on then the following monday directory and division chairman base on input from department heads as a first input we re consider draft  two- words first revision base on that first revision so psa and and the the one has that  they issue copies then the one has to unite to consult your colleagues in the same department at different departmental meeting and psa should have consult your staff so base on that sort of criteria the consultation uh took place  throughout about a week or so up until last saturday the heads of departments together with psa representatives and directory has a sec has the so called the third meeting so we collect inputs from all the heads who should have consulted the uh colleagues in the department to get the psa ' s input whereas a third look at the draft criteria is based on which we collect all the inputs and this morning we further discuss with with all the inputs from the department heads that is from the teachers on the one hand psa on the other we examined the draft and came up with the very final draft again so you can see that we try to take as much input from staff as possible through psa and also from departments now i also feel that members that would like to have an opportunity to have a direct communication like in this forum  so i i suggest to you and your chairman that if your psa wants uh open forum to have direct dialogue with myself and my senior colleagues who are here uh i welcome this opportunity because it is only through this direct dialogue and trying on our part to explain to you the backgrounds that will help us to implement this whole very important policy that i i i firmly believe that is only good for the future of this polytechnic because uh i don't think we can afford not to accept government ' s offer of parity  salary now that ' s all i want to say for the time being  in fact uh i do feel that member of staff if you want to ask the questions in english or or cantonese you are most welcome because i i i think communication should be in the most efficient way and uh i am quite prepared to answer questions in ei either english or cantonese a  and if questions are asked in cantonese i hope my expatriate  colleagues will will bear with this and one-word  your friends sitting next to you can can can interpret them  okay thank you very much now may i i attempt to answer both questions and my my senior colleagues could chip in and and then and then elaborate a bit further now the primary issues in fact there are two basic things here uh every one-word institutions keep on saying that they want to have their own autonomy in deciding uh how institutions run now uh for instance uh salary salary part is controlled essentially by government and to go with that there is called housing benefits uh and then the passage said all controlled by government they are all the same  this is a these are the most fundamental benefit is the salary the housing benefits the passages they are all identical now the variation could be in say the uh as you mentioned ssr that in fact ssr if you look at the one-word  book all institutions are very similar in terms of the average ssr are very similar in ssr and are and in terms of the length the teaching hours uh contact hour it is within our control i mean it is the the historical development of polytechnic that you have been teaching so many uh say thirty weeks a year as a academic year whereas as hong kong u takes only twenty four weeks it is not dictated by government dictated only by your own institutions so that ' s nothing to do with that we can change it if we want to to say fourteen weeks as academic year if you want to do it that way i ' m just joking i mean whether thirty or twenty eight or for  twenty four is really up to insti the institute to decide and also uh for instance leave university has got uh some kind of uh leave hong k one word have different type of leave again in the leave arrangements also vary from institutions to institutions again government is not going to dictate on that so whatever government will dictate will be even for all concern that is the benefits now in terms of criteria originally we thought well it may be  seem just have one common set of criteria applied to all in further look at in detail it won't work because different disciplines will have different so called uh aca academic requirement and there is also the the question of supply and demand and because in in some discipline it may not be practicable to request that phds must is is a must if you want to uh to phd is is is a fundamental requirement to be a lecturer then you will not be able to find a single member of staff in some disciplines at all so i mean discipline has got to be examined more more critically and and carefully now that ' s why in order to do our job proper we want to set down some fundamental so called minimum criteria for transfer promotions having done that well we look into differences so called disciplines by their very nature and see whether some should be more more stringent than others or whether some should be more relaxed than other depending on on the basic discipline of that subject concerned and also depends on the kind of uh market and as uh and  as supply are being made available so we have got to be very careful that ' s why we have a as i mention earlier that we are going through this is the fourth stage of of revision that ' s why we have paid so much attention and importance to this fundamental criteria issues  uhm in terms of salary and other condition of service all uptc institutions is only uh subject to one basic guideline where you cannot find exact comparison and that guideline is in the generality of provisions we shall not be better than civil servants so so in terms of leave now you may say counting the days polytechnic staff have a disadvantage but counting the frequency we definitely are more advantageous than the university for example university of hong kong i t t the contractual term or rather the one-word are very frequently longer than polytechnic and polytechnic staff almost every two year will have a a provision
