  so here we are uh nigel bruce english teacher in english centre having a chat with iris lam tut who is a student of  social science   social science  okay  are you in the general stream or   uhm uhm  general   general stream okay uhm which uh school did you go to  school pirmary school secondary school   yeah can you come can you   okay  uh what seconday school i go to good hope school in clearwater bay   clearwater bay  yeah for secondary school   yeah do you live near that  yeah uh quite close  i live in kowloon    quite close  kowloon  wong tai sin   uh ha  uhm uhm   alright i know it yeah yeah yeah yeah   uh ha  how long have you been here   me seventeen years  seventeen years so can you speak cantonese   siu siu laughs  siu siu these cantonese words stand for little  uhm uhm   i did cantonese uh twice  uhm uhm   seventeen years ago i did it for one semester   and i don't know did it didn't work out very difficult  uh name group and uhm just more quick to know didn't  seem to get the picture so last year some of our teachers organized the class again so i did whole year last year  uh we would trying quite hard and we very willing to do quite a few things but the interesting thing is that few months later i forgot interest about everything   uhm uhm   so   does it go   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  i think it would be easy     not worse but interest interest to say anything  i think it would be easier for you to learn a language when you are younger   thank you both-laugh  so you think it gonna be easier for the students here to learn english  yeah   yeah  uhm uhm   i hope so i hope so   me too  uh we have been learning since our primary uh ha so we we can do better than you do    uh  you have a slight american accent have you ever lived in america  no   no that ' s just my impression   yeah  maybe i watch too much american movies   yeah  yeah   okay  uhm uhm   but you got a good ear  i don't know   what about your school is it uhm is it uhm the primary school is it also in clearwater bay  no no no i go to primary school here in hong kong island  uh ha but then i moved to kowloon side after i go to secondary    alright   alright  uh okay  uhm   uhm si  do you  can you tell me something about your english  teachers of your teachers in general   how  maybe because my my my secondary school english teacher  is a tut  i think foreigners mostly  uh last year uh before i go to university there ' s an australian woman who came as teachers and uh i think there ' s american and then british  all kind of different expatriate  teacher taught in our school  because our school is a catholic school and we most of the time we speak english with our teachers    yeah   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm  uhm uhm  uhm uhm and uhm that ' s why my english is better on average  uhm uhm    uhm  uhm uhm most of your classmates too  yeah basically did actually  because we have more chance to practise of it    yeah uh ha  uh okay okay do you what ' s your opinion about uhm the new news to change the school the balance between english and chinese of the seventy percent of students roughly  uhm uhm   can that have the opportunity to study in chinese  uh you mean the teaching medium   yeah  i think it ' s kind of difficult  uhm i have uhm lesson in math i think yesterday    and teacher ask us uh if there ' s any people who don't understand cantonese i can use cantonese to teach because all of us are chinese    uh but we say no we have used to using english for those  math terms all those things  and uh that ' s why it ' s kind of hard for us just back to listen to chinese    uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   yeah  oh  it ' s a kind of     it is a lecture or tutorial  a lecture   uh ha  it ' s kind of weird i think   uh ha   uh ha but we are used to that   right  i i think some subject are difficult to teach in chinese just like economics  i study economics     just the  was the lecturer doing that as it just is the policy to always ask the students what medium they would prefer  or do you think that the lecturer  kind of wanted to to to do it in cantonese   uhm   i think they will do   i i i don't  i i don't think i think just what what what what the students prefer  for example when he we he dis  he tries to explain something that difficult  it ' ll hard for maybe for us to think in an english way  but easy for us do in chinese  but some how it turns out it should be although although it ' s waste  then we we do english better    alright   yeah yeah   yeah   right right   oh  yeah  uh ha   when you think that is can you think of a situation  uh i think i think in it give it because we use two languages the same time  see a film more we do a lot of english and chinese also and uhm tut i think also     uhm uhm   uhm   or you should try to think one example where would be more complicate if the lecturer try to use cantonese a math example can you think of one  economics   economics  cos most of the fam famous economics economists   are from usa british i think britain  and not many of them in china or or at south east asia  that ' s why it doesn't  most of the books are written in english not  chinese  if we read the translated the translated books  maybe it ' s kind of tut not that  original not as good    uhm   yeah yeah   uh   yeah   uh   uh   uhm  yeah  uh ha   so you think that more are that there are these technical terms in english  the more you ' ve been chopping and changing between english and  chinese   uhm uhm   yeah it ' s kind of difficult   english is too much chopping i guess it ' s really  a mess up what is   yeah  and uhm i think the people who suggest this this kind of thinking the seventy percent chinese or english whatever  i think that uh the main reason they want to do that is because uhm tut  many the language standard is dropping but i don't think uhm if we change back to chinese it will improve our english    uhm  uhm  do you see my point  uhm i think the main problem is that actually there is a drop of the the standard all word i think all over the world the people are more like to watch tv uh uh not not not do not like to read books or    uhm  you mean the dropping even in your mother tongue standard   yeah  yeah all alright     all foreign languages  yeah   yeah   the people ' s chinese are horrible > they write half chinese half english > and sometime we can't understand what they are trying to tell you   uhm  uhm uhm   really  yeah    tut it ' s interesting so how are you finding university after school  how do you find that i mean your  you mean passion  now you are involved in your first year in your first month right  near school   two-words  uhm uhm i think it ' s really okay   yeah  really okay but uhm it ' s kind of different from the secondary one because we we uh we we we uhm are all of our friends are gather together in same class and the same classroom  we often often see each other all the time all day long  and we can be good friends we go to have our lunch have our lessons together   one-word  but after we ' ve been in university we all go different places and we have different lectures we won't see each each other very often  uh it ' s kind of di di     uhm uhm   uhm   yeah   yeah   uhm i see  you don't meet at lunch time or  uh if we we don't have a lectures but if we have lectures or we have something else to do so just like uh we have a part-time job we have to leave early and and no time to chat or    and the   how many people still do part-time jobs  uh most of them uhm do like a private tutor  for some primary school students secondary school  students it ' s kind of ver very common phenomenon   in hong kong    uh ha   right right   yeah  is it particularly common in first year students or all three years  i think all for of three years  but uhm maybe the second year and third year students more busy with their studies  so they don't have much time     uhm   right right right you must have done the orientation did you in the  beginning   right  yeah   yeah did you do social science camp or something   like   two-words   i go to the sss uh the social science so society camp    uh  uh ha uh ha   uh ha  and i     is that good fun  i think that ' s fun i meet a lot of people but i don't remember their name  after all  $z-laughs  i just remember their faces and say oh you are tut and i don't remember anything   right right  that ' s kind of embarrassing   any of your schoolmates there  yeah some of them   uh ha  quite a  just a few   okay so you still got a new peers of school friends here   yeah  but uh i ' m making making more new friends i hope i can make more new friends in future uh ha     right right right  grow into different friends  uhm uhm   alright can you tell me a little bit about the orientation what were the kind of messages that were coming across   uhm uhm  coming across     yeah  it ' s is the chance to presumably for older students to bring you in to make you feel more home right  uhm they try to share their experience in the in the university life  for example uh the study problem they are they encounter uh what else let me see uh how do they uh what kind of uhm extracurricular activities such as those club   uh they they are buys us to join u team   and uh how ' s life in university in general  how are different different different kind of there ' s a lot i i i i i can't think think all them    yeah   uh   uh ha   uh ha   uh ha  right you in hall or you where you stay   uh not i ' m not in hall i ' m go back to home    yes  don't you stay  okay  how long it takes you to get here   two-words  about a an hour   uh ha  i get there by mtr and then to get the minibus or  bus three words     right right right  okay so thinking about the orientation what sort of things did they say about study  study   yeah did they say anything about how you should study or   most of them say that you don't need to study hard when you are in year one  and they say just uhm just do the tutorial things  and then give the essay and do  the exam and that ' s all and they said just play hard and study hard in your year one  two-words yeah uh play hard because they because we ' ve been studied quite hard  in form seven form six and this time for us to relax this what they said    uhm   uhm   right   right right right right   play hard   yeah   right  right  uhm uhm     okay  alright see everybody is relaxing then  yeah   what ' s your impression of the your courses that you are taking now you find that it quite difficult uh or is it similar level to school  i don't find them quite difficult as long as i think you read the material and then you listen to lectures  i think they are kind of interesting and uh very new to me because i i study public administration sociology and math  for this semester and uhm i i ' ve never studied those things before i was a arts student in a in a secondary school  and uh i think they ' re they ' re kind new to me  and i ' m still very interested in that but i don't know what would happen tut few weeks later   and uh uh i found that the lecturer very helpful when i ask them question they will say okay uh you can come and ask me things yeah    uh ha   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  you approach the lecturer after the lecture  yeah uh sometimes i can't find the book i just go and ask them they just say you can them where where where  and they are friendly uhm uhm    right right  so far what ' s the most more interesting in the subjects that you found  so far i think sociology   uhm uhm  and it talks about how ac  they were talk about in interaction one-word how we are influenced by other people and we influence the other too  uhm uhm i think uhm it it help me to understand myself better and also the others and the society as a whole as a whole  uh ha    uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  do you think you major in sociology  i think i will do sociology or psychology  yeah maybe economics or just choose one or two  uhm uhm    uh ha   right  can you major in economics so you don't  you do the   no  i think i can do duhk this cantonese word means read or study minor minor minor  uhm uhm    the econ   minor okay  one other thing if you join did you join any extracurricular thing  i do the i join the film society uh i like watch movies and uh  and then what is the name of that that i ' ve joined the sss as uh society  and uh i ' m planning to join a one-word  chinese is it eastern one-word courses or write english character looks like but are one-word and beautiful    yeah   society not good   uh ha   right right right  yeah do you found that uhm secondary school your writing  suffer  because you didn't get enough practice writing chinese   uhm uhm  uhm yeah a little bit   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm we do english most of time uh uh in my secondary i think form seven i do english english literature history economics and then chinese and i do own     you do chinese as well  yeah  i don't do only do one chinese compare to four english medium  stru stru stru subject just why i can't uh i can't find it my chinese is even worse worse    okay   uhm uhm  do you when students do the arts stream  did they always maintain chinese up to the seven form was it possible to not do it   uhm uhm  you it ' s possible not do it  but i think it is good to keep up  chinese     uhm   so how many people choose what percentage to choose to continue in arts the arts stream   uhm i think it ' s a it ' s a new policy that now all students have to take a course like chinese literature or no no chinese culture   in form six and form seven  that ' s why i think now about i think ninety-nine percent people do that  because it is    uhm   uhm   okay  that ' s reasonably  yeah very reasonably   okay okay   uhm uhm    uhm si presumably you have the option this last year did you have the option of writing your paper in chinese or english  no   oh is that any policy for a-level or as-level and you can you have the choice  i think you can choose the medium of writing of paper script most of mostly the school will choose it for your  age  just like my school is english     oh they chooses   oh the school is already chose it ' s not individual choice   yeah  uh ha uhm uhm   uh i see   if you want to do that you can go to that particular school  that provide you with chinese or english uhm uhm uhm uhm     i see okay alright  do you know anybody who chooses to change to do that  not much   uh ha  mostly they change from science subjects to arts subjects but not english to chinese or chinese to english i don't i don't i don't see uhm uhm    right right  or to write their history answer in chinese for example  they won't chose they won't choose to do that  uh not much  it ' s kind of harder i think   right  i i think if it is it if it ' s new subject to you uh i i don't think it doesn't matter whether you take it in chinese or english  but if you have taken it for about one or two years  and then you want to change to other  languages  it ' s kind of difficult    uh ha   yeah   yeah  yeah yeah  okay  what ' s uhm what your friends do are they uh they obviously they are living in hong kong right   what what ' s uh what ' s your father do i mean  uhm uhm   uhm uhm   what will do in spare time  uh go shopping go to restaurant finding one-word     what is in his job is what is he do  what is he do   yes his work  my family   uhm  uhm my dad and mum my mum is housewife and my daddy ' s a teacher  my uhm a secondary school teaching  and i have two little brothers one of them form six one of them form five uhm uhm    uhm uhm   okay   uh ha  they are following will be follow your foot steps   uhm  yeah uhm uhm  but they are science students    yeah  uh right uh what ' s your dad teach  did dad teach math    uh ha   uh but i ' m not good at math  i ' m not good both-laugh    you takes no responsibility for that   uhm uhm  i know why i just whenever i do math i just one-word   i ' m not concentrate that ' s why i ' m trying to force myself to do  math now  uh uh uh uh it ' s doing fine uh ha  i get a pass in the last assignment    yeah   really   yeah  good  uhm uhm   good that sort of self-discipline  uhm uhm   okay fine then your group need little work do you find that there are some students who really are lack your kind of confidence with english   uhm uhm  yeah maybe my be i i think most some secondary school in hong kong although they put they say that they are english chinese school   but most of them use chinese as the medium of instru  in teaching the students and therefore they don't have much chance to practise  ask question  yeah mix use half chinese half english or whatever  and our school is very strict on this point yeah all english except the chinese subjects that ' s why we have better chances for example we we do uh my school is a catholic school we do prays and all those assembly thing in english    that ' s why we can have more chance to practise for example we go the elder students will go up to lead a pray or  sing the song with the whole school uhm we have more chance to do that uhm uhm    yes   do they mix code   uh   uh ha uh ha   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   right right  you think that ' s really a minor that ' s all going to be a minority experience in hong kong   yeah  i hope that most students have chance to practise their english   yeah yeah yeah   yeah  speak it   i see we got you colleague coming  hello   okay the door opens     hi come on in   two words  uh do you have one-word    yeah you can come in have a seat it ' s alright  we can do this uh probably think you probably had a good sec   okay   i think i may go    you got a lecture  yeah
