""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
""
uhm  what about the activity
""
""
actually i might  i i i mean i myself like the idea of 
drama but i think it  ' s rather  t  time-consuming
""
""
  yes 
 
""
 uhm   uhm 
""
""
uh huh
 
""
and we  ' ve quite a little bit of time constraints 
""
""
yeah    what  what did we  do i mean what
did    you 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 form   six 
""
""
no no no i mean in  in the previous years   how did
we do it 
 
""
 previous years  
""
""
uhm the form six students
 
""
were they form six
""
yeah the form six students last year did uh  uh what was it
""
""
""
choral speaking
 
""
ah yeah choral speaking 
""
""
uh huh
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
it  ' s
""
i i i heard that it  ' s rather  entertaining
 
""
yeah but uh  they   very impressive   from the
 point of view of the lower forms 
""
""
 uh huh  
""
uh huh  but uhm  one-word  i am afraid i  ' m
not i won't be a good instructor but
 
""
maybe  both of you can  co-ordinate  the class 
""
""
uh uh
""
""
uhm
""
""
i better uh no
 
""
during oral lesson as well 
""
""
oh oral lesson we  then  but  we  ' ve asked the  s
s studen  the students to uhm  to be in charge of the oral lesson
""
i mean we  ' re going to do uhm  examination practice  uhm
every  other week    
""
and then  we  ' re go yeah  uh
""
""
 every other week  
 
""
so how are they going to be in charge 
""
""
uh i mean yeah
""
i mean for the uhm  examination practice we  i mean we two
will be   the  the person in  cha  will be the
person-in-charge but uhm  when we  ' re not doing the  uhm examination
practice  we  we  ' ve assign we  ' ve assigned  the student to  take
i mean to be in charge of the lesson
""
  they   they can design some  oral activities
 for the whole class
 
""
 oh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
anything 
""
""
yes anything i mean  you can i i i i told them that 
they could do anything i mean whatever they like as long as it is an oral
activity   
""
because  i want them to  practise i mean to have more
chance to   practise their  oral uh uh their oral   uh
huh  
""
let  ' s  let  ' s come back i mean  we can't do it  i mean we
we  ' re not going to practise anyway uh during the oral lesson maybe
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm
""
uhm uhm
""
but if you take into consideration the time we have left 
""
""
uh huh
 
""
uh huh  if we can decide today and  inform them about our
decision  tomorrow  then they  ' ll have the    
one-word  census  yeah  to start preparing 
""
and then when they come back they  ' ll only have seven days of
lessons with us  and then it  ' s the easter holiday 
""
""
 census holiday  
""
oh really
 
""
and as soon as they come back from the easter holiday it  ' s the
 english day 
""
""
oh ha 
$z laughs  that means  we probably we  ' re going to have make-up
lessons
 
""
yeah perhaps 
""
""
we need to we we we do need to do  to do that i  
think 
 
""
 uhm   uhm 
""
""
so  i i i i like the idea
""
i mean i i i heard you  s 
""
uh  you told me that  th  for the lower forms they  ' re
going to  have some kind of uhm  singing performance     i
mean english songs i think it
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
and story-telling   for form one  
""
""
 yes and   maybe
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uh i think  they may enjoy singing
""
my class like the  the phantom of  the opera  so much
that they 
""
i mean whenever we  ' ve time
""
for example you know after the  uhm listening uh practice we
usually have five minutes left then at that time they will say oh miss hui we
don't want to continue and and then i said okay then what we  ' re going to do
now
""
we  ' ve got five or ten minutes left  two-words 
""
let  ' s sing that  phantom of the opera
""
especially gloria  she always make with us  such a 
suggestion
""
she  she made it for i mean three  or more than three times
  and then  
$b laughs  we  ' re not going to do this song uhm i because i don't want to
froze free frozen you  all laugh 
""
it  ' s what are you judy said you   know
""
usually  say to them
""
uhm  but it seems that they like singing 
""
  
$a laughs  i  wouldn't think of the what they will do 
$a laughs  singing phantom of the opera 
$b laughs 
""
it  ' ll be a good idea
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 but then  
""
but then uhm uhm perhaps the form six students can do a bit more
""
""
""
  yeah 
""
""
 huh huh  
""
huh huh
 
""
uhm 
""
""
how about some kind of musical  i mean some somewhat like
uh uh  what should i say uhm somewhat like a 
""
i mean include the singing and  and  what  ' s that
""
role play  role play 
""
uh actually we
""
do you know that we we  ' ve asked the form six student i mean 
both classes to do radio play  uh i  ' m sorry   radio 
 
""
 radio programs  
""
""
 radio programs  
""
""
yeah uh huh
 
""
i  ' ve heard about that but i thought it was with the form five
""
""
""
no no no no no
""
i think we can't do it with the form five student even though we
 we did  i mean we did think of  it but uh the  we  we  ' re
running out of time for form five
""
uhm  i haven't  y  i haven't yet listened to the the
radio play but i think it should i mean the radio programs i mean their
cassette tape but uh i think uh it should be  quite  good  as i i
hope  and   expect   because i i  ' ve  read the  uh
script  it  ' s quite creative    
""
so i think i i i was thinking of whether we can make use of the
 radio  program because they don't they  that means  they don't
need to spend any i mean don't  need to spend any   more time
""
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
we we may make  part make use of part of it   
because  in the radio program the one section is uhm what  ' s that
""
 ra  radio play is it
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
uhm  in my class  not many students produced  uhm
 radio plays
""
  instead   they they prefer songs 
""
that saves them a lot of time
""
""
 wo uh  
""
but did you limit  ha   the number of song that they can
include   in within  the twenty minutes
""
""
 uhm  
""
some groups included  two  two to three songs
""
""
okay no more than three i hope
""
""
uhm   uhm 
""
""
 yeah  
""
uh huh
""
acceptable
""
""
and they prefer interviews to     radio plays
""
""
 uh huh  
 
""
uhm 
""
""
okay then
""
have you  hea  have it  have you  listen to the 
radio programs
""
not yet
""
""
i haven't got any time
""
""
 laughs  neither did  neither did i
""
""
at the moment uhm i am busy marking the compositions
""
""
uh form six or form five
""
""
form five uh  it  ' s form six
""
  my class 
""
""
 uh yes  
 
""
uhm uhm
""
the form fours last year did a role play     but
it turned out to be  quite boring
""
well   to the audience  
""
""
 uhm uhm
""
uhm uhm  
""
 but it did not mean     
""
depends  on the content   of it 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 yeah  
""
and it depends on how many  students are involved in it 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
uhm uhm
""
how they  attempt to entertain the audience 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
uhm uhm
 
""
but the students last year i think  they came out well there
were some  people walking around  at the back but 
$a laughs    two  main characters one 
$a laughs   being the interviewer and the other one the interviewee
""
""
""
  one-word   
""
what  ' s the point of having 
$z laughs  the  what the extras  all laugh  on the stage 
$a laughs 
 
""
well  to  to make the audience feel more people are
involved 
""
""
 two cantonese words 
 
""
create a more  crowded atmosphere 
""
""
i see
""
but then
 
""
because it it  it was simply an interview    one
 person asking questions   the  other one answering
""
and they pretend to be  all sorts of fictitious people 
  like   uh i can't remember  the  manager of  
the vitasoy  company michael jackson     anita mui 
things like that 
""
""
 uh huh  
""
 uh huh  
""
 uh uh uh uh uh  
""
 oh i see  
""
 uh huh  
""
uhm uhm
 
""
uhm uhm and it wasn't very interesting 
""
""
that means the content uh uh  but  that means it it
really depends on the content
""
  i mean  if they  ' re  rather   
informative  then the students   probably  won't like it
""
but my for my class uh  the one of the radio programs is a 
a kind of  interview but  d  do you know who  they interview 
""
it could is uhm a kind a kind of characters some uh like coco 
coco kung     and  she got a daughter i mean  on the uh
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
doctor
""
""
 dau   daughter
""
  daughter  daughter  and  uh uh the character
of the daughter is rather  is rather  entertaining really because uhm
 you know for coco she always say uhm  say something uh she she is
rather she is very proud of herself   and  she thinks that she
is very  uhm  beautiful
""
i mean you know   just like 
$a laughs   coco kung
""
and  she  uhm  what and  she  always say something
good about herself   and  what i do and i like doing something
""
i like uhm uh uh my my life is always very uh  health healthy
and all   sorts of thing 
""
but uh i mean  during the interview the  the  the
daughter  s  seems to be rather silly or maybe innocent   
""
""
she always say  speak up the truth 
$b and
$z laugh 
""
that means uhm but  it  ' s not the case
""
she always like uhm i i saw many  male very handsome male
visiting my mum and they uh spend the the night time together   and
the  i mean the man change uhm  every other week maybe or or  m
 every weekend 
$b and
$z laugh 
""
you know these  such kind of silly things   and then
 their  the  ma  i mean the  ma  mother have to stop
her stop  laughs  the daughter so it create  a rather uhm kind of
entertain
""
and i i i i myself when i uhm  read uhm when i read it i  i
i really laughed    
""
because it  ' s rather  i mean it  ' s quite interesting
""
""
 daughter  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm   
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm 
""
""
 two words  we we can i mean we can make
use of it
""
i will ask the  the class because uh  maybe
""
oh no we don't i don't have any  ex  any english lesson uh
""
but uh  uh i think after they  ca   they came back
after they come back from the census holiday i am going to play the radio 
tape the the the  cassette tapes   to the  whole class
""
and  s  and  also maybe by the by that time i should be
able to  uh  or maybe i  ' ll ask them to  choose    one
 
""
i mean the best one  the  by some kind of election you 
 know   and then they can make use of the of it
""
i mean it can we can include it as part of the  program for the
english week and they don't need to uh spend any extra time   doing
something 
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
and then they can concentrate on  thinking about   how
to  act it out     or costumes and the props and things
  like that  
""
""
 ya ya  
""
 ya ya  
""
 uh huh   but i think it won't be enough because the
 someone laughs  
""
uhm uhm what what so funny 
$a laughs 
""
""
i i am thinking of the costumes for coco kung  all laugh
""
""
""
but we need a we need a uh uh a student which is rather uhm
you know the the  fig   fig  the body figure should   be
really  attract  laughs  i mean really cute
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
i think 
$a laughs   well in the  graduation in the last year   
 they  chose three students who are  well  considered 
""
i think  was it  what was the  i am not sure what the
criteria     were last year but it  ' s based on the 
address i think    and  their appearance  and  i
remember  them choosing  cecilia 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uh
""
uh huh
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
which   cecilia 
 
""
 i can't   remember the other   one is  
""
""
  one-word    cecilia my  in
my   class 
""
""
 oh   oh your class
""
uhm uhm
 uhm uhm
""
how about the other two
 
""
can't remember   
$a laughs 
 
""
perhaps they  ' re found elsewhere because 
""
""
oh maybe yeah
""
""
uhm uhm uhm uhm
 
""
i remember her wearing a  long white gown    very
 beautiful white gown 
""
""
 uh  er  
""
wow
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
is it very sexy  all laugh 
""
it need to be sexy  all laugh 
""
but what should i say
""
i mean they need  she need to put  something   
laughs   to   make it 
 
""
 uhm    
""
 get her 
 
""
  two-words    make up as well
""
""
""
that i mean
""
""
get her a  an extra large bra  all laugh 
""
""
yeah  laughs 
""
yeah  maybe we need  laughs  and yeah it   
 it be it
""
i think it         it it will be a
good idea    
""
but apart
""
okay let  ' s say  for example that uhm do we  do we all agree
that we  ' re going to have some kind of uhm  role-play    
""
i mean based on the material they  ' ve decided and  and  ap
  and apart from this role play what  what else are we going to do
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
 huh huh  
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
well then we only have about  uh think for form six 
fifteen minutes   about that  yeah 
""
""
 fifteen minutes  
""
but i don't  but if we just do this thing i think we have to
ask them to lengthen it
 
""
yeah 
""
""
no 
""
i  i ask my students to produce  the radio programs uhm
which lasts about uh  last for about  s     twenty minutes
""
 
""
 twenty minutes   
""
""
but i mean  if  you know  for the radio  program
they include  s 
""
""
songs
""
""
pardon
""
""
no no no
""
""
what do you
""
what uh
""
""
songs
""
""
yeah yeah
""
that  ' s it and also i mean for my class  i  ask them to do
 four at least four different things    
""
should be  commercial  uhm song i mean they could include
song but  just i mean of the  least lowest priority    
""
and they should include interview  radio play  uhm  what
else 
""
commercial  news report  and that make up the that  makes
up  twenty minutes    
""
so  if we can't  i mean for that    radio play
""
 
""
 oh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
  radi    last only i i don't know but 
no more than  five  minutes i think
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
 sh sh sh 
""
we can make use of the commercial as well i mean  they  ' re
quite they are really  laughs  really creative as well
 
""
 two-words  maybe possible
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
 one-word  but
 
""
i am thinking about how to     involve the others
""
""
""
 uhm  
""
yeah i i i i like to involve the  whol  as    as
many students 
""
yeah
 
""
 yeah as many students  
""
as possible but but asking them to prepare  props  costumes
 lightings     sound 
""
""
 uhm  
""
uhm
""
yeah they have uh huh
 
""
or maybe i was thinking about because  if the role play itself
lasts for about five or  six or seven minutes maybe     can
you choose two groups  perhaps 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
but would be 
""
if we do the same thing and  it  ' s rather strange
""
i mean if it is a kind of uhm  a totally totally different uhm
 kind of     program  wou  would be  better
rather than  doing the same thing   two  times
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah  
""
uhm 
""
""
excuse me do you feel cold  all laugh 
 
""
maybe i  ' ll do it 
""
""
thanks  a long pause 
 
""
yes 
""
""
high cool
""
""
yeah  low cool 
""
turn it into low cool
""
  and also 
""
""
 by the way   uhm   for  hi-fi we
   say   to turn down the volume but for  ed  for
air-con  how should we  put this i mean  to lower the  temp uhm
""
$a laughs 
""
i i don't know how to express it
""
""
 do it  
""
 it  ' s ten is it the  
""
yeah
""
do you know what what we mean
""
""
  if we want 
""
""

""

""
""
what  ' s it the verb for the action  that
 
""

hi-fi

turn down the volume
""
""
not  volume  is it
""
turn down   the   air-conditioner
""
""
 it won't be  
 
""
i  ' ve never said that before  laughs  
""
""
but that    i mean how do you 
 
""
  i mean   nor    normally  normally
""
""
""
how how do you express that  idea  laughs  
""
that mean i what should i say 
""
i feel a little bit cold     and could you please 
dot dot dot dot dot what should i  say dot dot dot  
$a and
$z laugh 
 
""
 yes  
""
oh  that  ' s the problem  
$b laughs 
""
""
how about the  uh yeah 
""
how about
""
i try to turn it point ten

   laughs

it  ' s a little  bit strange
""
""
 turn the air  
""
turn the   air-con down 
 
""
 i  ' ve never thought   that before  because
normally at home  when someone is shivering and point it turn it down 
laughs  i have never thought about what    object 
$z and
$b laugh   
""
""
 but okay that means you  
""
""
turn it down
 
""
what the object may be   all laugh 
""
""
but if you use  it  that means you  the
pronoun
""
that means the  p  the pronoun is it stands for the
air-conditioner
""
that mean if you can say  turn it down it should be all right
to say turn the air-onditioner down
 
""
  uhm  
""
""
 turn   down the air-con 
$a laughs 
 
""
turn down the air-con   laughter followed by long pause

""
""
no  no idea
 
""
no idea 
""
""
how about  hi-fi
""
""
turn   uh  two words  
""
""
 turn down   the volume
""
""
  yeah volume 
""
  it  should be all right
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 but  
""
oh  there might be some misunderstanding because uhm you said
no  because  when i asked you whether we should use  turn down
 to  uhm  whether we should use  turn down
 for a hi-fi you said no and
 
""
oh i thought if you are saying    turn  down the
volume for  the air-con 
""
""
 uhm    all laugh 
""
""
uh huh uh huh uh
""
""
but an air-con doesn't have any volume  all laugh 
 uhm uhm
 
""
uhm
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
okay
""
""
that means for hi-fi it should  it it is all right
""
yeah i always find it difficult to express this kind of  what  ' s

""
you know for  s  the english that we use for  
daily life  in daily life i mean  i always find it difficult to
express certain idea
""
example i  i i just learn how to say  uhm 
1-syllable  turn no no no draw close the blind
""

""
do we say   close  or  draw up   the blind
""

""

""
""
 blinds  
""
the blind
 
""
blinds  uh huh
""
that  ' s another question 
""
""
but i learn it
""
i just forgotten it
""
""
dino taught us
""
""
yes
""
""
uhm  pull the blinds
""
""
it depends on what kind of blind it is
""
it  it is like somewhat like this one which should be 
 draw up  or  draw down 
""
 one-word  he   or 
""
""
 no   no no no
""
not what no no
""
""
pull up  pull up  pull the  pull the blind 
""
i i i i taught the student but now i  ' ve forgotten it 
$z laughs 
""
close  but it should be all right for us to say close the blind
""
""
what  but it seems that i  ' ve learned that
""
""
not  close  
""
i  ' m quite sure it  ' s not  close 
 
""
draw the blind 
""
""
 draw  would be if you do it in a  
what  ' s  it  hori 
 
""
 yeah   
""
uhm uhm
""
horizontally 
""
""
horizontally then we can say    draw
 
 
""
 draw   the curtains 
""
""
draw the blind
 
""
draw the blinds 
""
""
draw the curtains  but not  draw the   
one-word  
""
""
 but   you know this
""
but  there are some kind of blind  two words
  it is like  in a  vertical i   mean  not
not the horizontal one but the  ver    vertical one 
 
""
 yes  
""
 but but  
""
but  but what we  ' re moving are the  the flaps  not the
 the whole thing 
""
""
but  dino  said that we can use the word  
draw  if it is a  vertical one
 
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
 draw the blind  but  yes i remember
""
he was rather
""
i mean he also didn't know how to answer our question when we
asked him 
""
uh it should be two years ago uh no maybe  one years ago 
one year ago 
""
yeah  becau  i mean  for this kind of daily life
language he they  he  it seems that they i mean for native speaker you
don't  bother you don't really bother how to say it you just 
""
for example you can use hand gesture or  s 
""
i mean anyway you can make other people understand what you mean
so   you don't  you don't need to  to  to learn how to say
that
""
but for us we it seems that we have to learn it because 
sometimes students may ask us and  laughs  how to
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
then it  ' s natural for native speakers
""
maybe the words  would come to their minds    as
  as soon   as   they need it
 
""
  one-word   
""
 yeah yeah   
""
""
need it
 
""
it comes naturally   
""
but  when when   you ask  me to analyse 
$a laughs 
""
the more  deeply i think  the more difficult  it is to
find the word  
$a &
$b laugh 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 you ask  
""
just like what i asked you yesterday
""
uh  but i asked you whether we can use the word  for
  for  simple  pa  for  simple past tense
 
""
uh huh   uh huh uh huh  
""
""
 do you still remember  
""
and yes how about  i i mean what  ' s uh  the answer
