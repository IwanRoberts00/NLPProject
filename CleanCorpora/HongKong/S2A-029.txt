""
okay now that you have some refreshment let  ' s uh  begin the
uh the second session 
""
uhm i  ' ll just begin by saying that uh that the very enthusiastic
response we had this morning so i  i have no doubt you know we will be a
tremendous encouragement to  to uh the committee of this postgraduate uh
common room uh and uh and no doubt you know they would uh uh continue to work
hard on uh arranging similar opportunities
""
really basically for all interaction among the research students and
between the research students and the faculty
""
this is a a dimension of postgraduate education which we believe to
be extremely uh important
""
uhm okay the uh the second session
""
uh you all perhaps have seen the uh  uh the title
""
uh the title again all this is  the title and the speaker are all
arranged in by the by the students and uh the title picked was pursuing
excellency in research 
""
and it  ' s going to be a dialogue between the supervisors and the
research students
""
uhm  i i must say i wanted to chair but i really have very
little idea how it will turn up  turn out you know so 
several-words 
""
uh i i like to say first of all it  ' s going to be  informal you
know
""
and uh say whatever you think you would like to say  and uh so
that we have you know very good uh communication and then understand each
other better
""
we may not be able to come up with a solution but at least there
will be more understanding uhm of of the topic
""
uh so so i emphasise on the fact that you  ' re going to be informal
and you can speak in english cantonese or putonghua 
""
and looking around and if you speak in uh cantonese and putonghua
uh i  ' ll try to interpret 
""
the other teacher
""
i think i have  arranged  somebody to help me just in case i
 you know i can't do do that 
""
am i right  2 words   
a-speaker-interjects 
""
okay we we were saying that uh uh if for some  reas  i  ' ll
try to interpret if somebody speak up in uh in in cantonese or putonghua and
if i i may need some help
""
i understand that uh edwin that you you  ' d be prepared to to do
some interpretation  another-speaker-interjects-in-response-to-a 
""
yeah but  it it won't be a word by word interpretation
""
it will be a you know trying to  convey the gist of uh whatever
that has been said
""
uhm so our format is that we have three student speaker and three
staff three speaker from the uh faculty uh uhm  and so each will speak
let  ' s say about six or seven minutes and uh and we would have if you anybody
has any questions one may ask immediately after the speaker finish uhm 
""
let  ' s have some discussion at that stage alright
""
and uh  but uh we  ' ll also have a big a longer discussion at the
end
""
and uhm i hope to finish uhm in not too much after an hour you know
""
probably hopefully we  ' ll finish uh uh between not later than half
past twelve i would say uh 
""
uhm okay  so uh  i i would ask uh the that the student speak
first okay
""
uh and uh i suggest you use your mike uh the mike in front of you
uhm 
""
uh thank you 
""
vera  
""
""
""
i have to admit i was heavily sedated by dr david  coop
 uhm cooper david  ' s charm when i agreed to do this talk and now i  ' m
quaking in my boots in the presence of all these learned people here who have
much much more supervisory experience than myself
""
so what do i do when i  ' m in a quandary
""
i go look for the person who has always been reliable in giving me
good advice my own phd supervisor
""
so in the next few minutes i  ' m going to tell you what i saw heard
and did in those years when i was working in my supervisor  ' s lab and to
share with you some of the experiences and to show you the viewpoint from the
student side and from my supervisor side and let you do the analysis and then
the  the decision
""
i came to my supervisor  ' s lab first of all as an undergraduate
student assistant in the summer  having worked with him and liked and
admired his work i then went on to register for a masters under him
""
when i finished my masters i decided i had not had enough so i went
back to brian morton and asked to do a phd with him 
""
he agreed
""
we had over the years a very very good working relationship and
today i find out how lucky i was  because i understand some graduate
students don't even talk to their supervisors afterwards  but this is not
going to be the case i hope in the polytechnic here 
""
okay so what is it that my supervisor i shall call him brian from
this point onwards what is it that brian and i did together which made it
work so well 
""
the first thing that brian gave to me and which i hope to give to
all my students is roots
""
what do i mean by roots
""
okay  brian is a very famous uh worker on the anatomy of
shellfish 
""
brian  ' s supervisor was a guy called dick  1-word
 who was very very famous for looking at the stomach of shellfish
and dick  1-word   ' s supervisor was sir maurice young 
who received a knighthood for his work on coral reef biology many many years
ago
""
so i have roots
""
i could bask in reflected glory of all these famous people who i
have never met before
""
and then i went to my first scientific meeting
""
it was an international meeting
""
i had published nothing
""
i was just a graduate student
""
and there i was in front of the sea of people like yourselves
""
i was absolutely petrified
""
i didn't know what to do and yet i wanted to talk to all these
people whose work i  ' d read about
""
so i started approaching them and they asked me where i was from
""
i said i was from brian morton  ' s lab and suddenly doors opened for
me
""
people suddenly who were not interested very much in my poster
decided they wanted to talk to me about my work
""
my supervisor had given me roots and an introduction to the network
without even being there 
""
this is what i hope to do with my students
""
i hope to be able to through my research introduce my students to
their field and this i  ' m sure is what all the supervisors who  are here
today have been doing
""
and i think this is one of the hidden aspects of supervision that
students may or may not appreciate especially in the beginning of their work
as graduate students 
""
the second thing that my supervisor gave me was a nasty temper
wings and independence
""
brian left me very much to my own devices
""
like professor cheng said go and do something useful
""
most of the time brian was like that
""
the reason 
""
he had a very big lab
""
nineteen graduate students and i was one of nineteen 
""
okay so brian was very very busy all the time
""
now some of you here working in big research groups will have the
same problem
""
your supervisor is constantly busy
""
he has time to give you regular meeting say once a month once every
two weeks or whatever the frequency might be
""
what do you do in the mean time
""
well brian was very busy but i never felt that i couldn't ask him
""
""
he might be busy but if i sensed that he was in a good mood i would
go and  1-word  him and this what i advise everybody to do
""
go and  1-word  him when he  ' s all alone okay
especially if you need money extra money for your work
""
talk to him whenever you need to
""
i felt that my supervisor was very aggressive very moody person but
whenever i genuinely indicated that i needed help he never turned away from
us all of us all nineteen of us in the lab at that time
""
so uh this is my suggestion to everybody and i  ' m sure you  ' ll find
your supervisors very cooperative if you do that
""
be active be reasonable  and go for it
""
okay uhm  you would now get the impression that brian and i got
on very well together and we had no problems 
""
wrong
""
brian and i had what somebody said an extremely tumultuous
relationship
""
we had lots of arguments and i used to take sides because in this
big lab with  pos  postgraduate students  students gang up if they
find they supervisors are not being fair and this is something that all
supervisors need to be aware of
""
okay i  ' ll give you some case studies in what happened during my
years in brian  ' s lab 
""
why weren't you in the lab this morning
""
i came back at nine thirty
""
you weren't there
""
what were you doing
""
now this poor student was just thinking about asking brian for two
days leave to go home to see the sick parents 
""
what  ' s he going to do now
""
if he asked brian right then the answer would be no and what was
the matter with the student
""
he had been working late
""
like vera said  stud  some students prefer to work late and
come in late  and this is very usual
""
so as supervisors should we be looking at the duty roster all the
time and scoring what time students are coming in and what time they are
leaving 
""
i think perhaps not
""
perhaps we should be uhm referring back to the research plan that
we the student and supervisor together put forward at the start of the tenure
""
many people submitted the research plan to the rpso and probably
forget about it
""
i think the polytechnic has a very good system and we should use
that plan to set our goals and set reasonable deadlines dates and stick to
them and in this way we would reduce the  unnecessary friction between
staff and students with regard to turning up when where and how 
""
then there is the problem that vera also mentioned and this is how
graduate students feel in the middle of their studies when they get depressed
""
my graduate student started off so well
""
he was such a promising candidate but i don't know what happened
to him recently
""
he  ' s just lost all interest
""
is that common or is it common 
""
well the reason is when graduate students start off everybody in
their third first year extremely enthusiastic
""
they set off and build a very nice program of work
""
in the second year things get to be routine 
""
graduation is not for a long long time yet and it seems that the
light  at the end of the tunnel is just too far away  so we get bored
""
so then we begin to look around and we begin to lose confidence
and i think that supervisors have a duty to provide the stimulus for students
at this stage to keep them alive
""
and i can think of no better stimulus than allowing the student to
go to a big conference 
""
most of the students who have been to an international conference
especially out of town come back really really rejuvenated
""
they come back and want to tell you about everything about
everybody they have met full of new ideas 
""
and apart from the obvious benefits about going to a conference
the other thing is that your student will be presenting something
""
he will be finishing a bit of work
""
he will be proud of it
""
he would have gone to the conference and come back full of
self-confidence and that is a great booster for the next stage of work
""
well this is what happened to me and i  i could only recommend
it because of the therapeutic to value that i obtained at the time when i did
it
""
so  just a suggestion 
""
and finally we come to the worst part which is the part about
thesis writing
""
graduate students are very very good at doing lab work
""
they are very good at doing all the graphics that the supervisors
have never heard about  but when it comes to writing  there seems to be
the writer  ' s block 
""
what do we do
""
i think well i  ' m going to tell you my first chapter first draft
was corrected seven times after which i was hardly speaking to my supervisor
""
""
well i didn't know
""
i didn't have a clue how to write
""
i could read lab reports
""
i  ' ve read lots and lots of journals and my supervisor expected
that because i had read the journals i should be able to write just like them
 but what was lacking was the know how
""
in the end i found this book which was called technical report
writing today by a guy called stephen  pauling 
""
my book is very very old you understand but it saved my life and i
would recommend it to everybody
""
we mustn't expect our students to be able to write as mature
scientists or engineers or whatever
""
they need the training and we need the patience
""
and i don't know how to go about uh  telling people how to do
it because i  ' m very inexperienced myself but all i can say is that if at the
end of the day if i can do  for my students a fraction of what my
supervisor did for me then i would think i have succeeded
""
thank you
