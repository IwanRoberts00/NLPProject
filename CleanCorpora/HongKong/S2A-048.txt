""
""
 candidate  have a factor competitive act over their 
uhm general competitors
""
the salaries uh generally  affected  about twelve to thirteen
thousand a month
""
they are now absorbed into different employment sectors uh it
""
now this is a general picture
""
okay i  ' ll go on to  another area 
""
now i use hong kong u graduates  '  employment situation as a case
""
i  ' ll go on to today  ' s topic of how  they are going to maintain
 what  their employment competitiveness 
""
uh that is   three words   a long pause
""
""
now i  ' ll use hong kong u graduates  '  employment situation as a case
to illustrate what local graduates can do to maintain their competitive edge
""
it is today  ' s main theme
""
now before  you are going to consider  how  uh local
graduates can maintain their edge over their competitors
""
then first of all you need to understand the current
characteristics of the current economic scene
""
because employment and economic are closely related
""
before you are going to analyse the employment situation you have
to understand the current economic situation
""
then a three major characteristics  nowadays in hong kong
""
the first  is globalization
""
globalization is the first characteristic in today  ' s economic
scene
""
that  mean  the economic competition is not just 
 one-word  on or original bases
""
in fact it is going on for a worldwide bases on an international
bases
""
alright this is the first characteristic
""
the second characteristic  knowledge economy that is  the
economy current economy is based on specialized knowledge and advanced
technology
""
this is the second characteristic
""
the third characteristic  is the rapid economic development of
mainland china
""
the current hong kong economic scene are dominated by these three
 major characteristic
""
 this  is the globalization knowledge economy and rapid
economic development of mainland china
""
now you have to have such a general picture before you go on to 
 think  an the employment scene
""
now these three  major characteristics bring about challenges as
well as opportunities
""
now what are the challenges because of the characteristic
""
uhm first  globalization
""
what challenges does it bring about
""
now more intensive competition because of globalization 
""
employers or enterprises will have to  climb  for their
survival
""
they have to compete for survival
""
they are aiming at higher productivity at lower cost
""
that is they have to  cut their cost
""
and to increase productivity at the same time
""
that is to do more with less
""
it  ' s very difficult but it is the situation
""
alright so everywhere you can see that you need to enhance your
productivity at even lower cost
""
this is the characteristic the lower cost
""
you also to survive otherwise and not survive so your 
one-word  will end up in bankruptcy or in uhm  uhm liquidation
and so on
""
this is the first challenge that globalization that will bring
about
""
the second challenge  is knowledge  economy 
""
what challenges that is the employer  they will need higher
academic qualification because it is uh the job requirement will become
higher and higher
""
they require employer they require higher academic qualification
and higher level of confidence
""
i mean is to meet the requirement of the job
""
not just academic qualification you need higher qualification
""
you need uh better qualification that is uh almost academic
qualification
""
but the employer will look at other qualities in addition to your
certificate in addition to your paper  conviction 
""
this is the what we call higher level of  confidence 
""
later on i  ' ll elaborate on  what  ' s meant by higher level of
 confidence 
""
this is the second challenge that it will bring about
""
the third challenge  because of rapid economic development of
mainland china
""
what challenge  does it bring about
""
that is the increasing number of industrial and commercial
organization they  ' re moving northward
""
alright over the past ten  tut  twenty years
""
all of you know that commerce and maybe commercial industrial
organization moving to the mainland because the labour cost  is lower
""
the land cost is lower
""
it  ' s closely related with globalization
""
then because of the moving of the uhm commercial and industrial
corporations northwards
""
it will bring about  unemployment immediate redundancy in
immediate replacement in hong kong
""
everyday you can read  an a newspaper you can watch  from the
television that many people become  unemploy  because of their
operations are moving northward
""
these are the challenges  brought about by the three major 
char  characteristics of an economy scene
""
but at the same time it  ' s not so gloomy
""
these characteristic will also bring about  opportunities
""
now these opportunity are based on economic restructuring
""
the hong kong  ' s economy is changing
""
it  ' s basically that whole structure is changing
""
it  ' s called economic restructuring and transformation
""
if you can live up to the requirement of the transformation then
you can survive
""
if there are opportunities if you cannot live up to you cannot
catch up with the transformation then probably you are facing great
difficulties
""
now opportunity the first  globalization
""
china  ' s a section to the wto world trade organization
""
now china has join wto and because china  ' s a section to wto
""
many foreign investment will come to hong kong
""
because they will try to use hong kong
""
they will set up offices in hong kong in order to serve as a 
gate  to the vast  mass  vast employment uh vast  uh business
market in the mainland
""
alright the vast population uh uhm  uhm one thousand  three
hundred billion people
""
so vast  uh business opportunity
""
okay this  ' s the first opportunity
""
the second one hong kong  ' s unique position 
""
uh geographical proximity hong kong is so near to the mainland
""
and not just geographical proximity how  cons  how  terr
 economic social and  politics  link with the mainland
""
place local graduate in a unique position to be one of their
potential and to develop their strength
""
this is a  very unique position opportunity arrive  from john
 one-word 
""
john  one-word  it is is the  one-word
 capital uhm  one-word  between hong kong 
entrepreneur and chinese on the mainland entrepreneur
""
uh there are several important scene important finance uhm career
fields which may offer opportunity for graduate
""
particularly finance trade transport communication energy
innovation technology innovative technology and tourism
""
these are the scenes that many local categories join hands with 
categories from uhm mainland in order to develop business
""
this is the second opportunity
""
and later on from this opportunity you will know that you need to
learn better putonghua better chinese
""
alright later on i  ' ll go on to call  one-word 
and so on
""
to relate my comment to  uh the situation opportunity okay
""
the third one that is opportunity is the  exist  hong kong
 sar government
""
hong kong sar government  ' s initiative to invest  to promote
investment and to invest in a lot of infrastructure in several field high
technology
""
the total amount probably all you have read from the newspaper six
hundred billion 
""
six hundred billion in the near future in mutli media application
in chinese medicine in tourism in infrastructure  railways mtr and so on
help to create a wide rate of autonomous opportunities for graduate with good
professional knowledge
""
not just for everybody but graduate particularly with good
professional knowledge  local experience and a high level of proficiency
in both english and chinese languages  alright
""
every year the career centre conduct surveys to collect information
collect it back from employer
""
later on we  ' ll look at what do employer expect from those 
grad 
""
these are the scene i  ' ll  object  the scene for you
""
uh ha about the general employment situation about the current
economic  characteristic about the challenges it bring about
""
and about the  opportunities that  brings  economic
characteristic will bring about to the people come from
""
now then let look at  another area 
""
what would local graduate do to enhance the whole person
development
""
as i mention i think early the employers are expecting more and
more from a candidate if you apply for a job
""
many years ago most employer will just look at the paper 
conviction 
""
okay if you have a a degree if you have diploma certificate and so
on they will take you on
""
they assume that you can perform the job well
""
but nowadays they will look at some other aspects
""
you that look at the whole  version  other skills as well
uh 
""
there are seven things 
""
local graduate have to do seven thing
""
uh later i  ' ll elaborate one by one
""
the first  you need to acquire the better understanding of
mainland china  as related to my uhm previous elaboration on opportunity
economic development opportunity in the mainland
""
if you are going to take up employment if you are going to  uh
develop your career in the mainland you
""
the basic  thing is to acquire a better understanding of
mainland china
""
this is the first thing
""
the second thing  that normal graduate will need to do  is
 global perspective international perspective
""
you have to widen your horizon
""
if you just uh spend all your time in hong kong probably you maybe
not be sufficient to meet employer  ' s expectation global perspective
""
number three  you need to develop  two-words
""
""
not just paper  conviction  you need to enhance your
 two-word 
""
later on i  ' ll elaborate what meant by  two-word
""
""
that these are all the requirements by employers
""
number four  language proficiency
""
okay improve language proficiency
""
number five  need to do 
""
practical work experience
""
before you graduate if you are about to enter university uh
""
it  ' s time for you to make use of the summer vacation
""
the first year summer vacation second year summer vacation to
acquire some practical work experience to clear and specific career
perspective
""
you cannot just spend all your time on your books
""
you have to acquire practical work experience before you graduate
""
this is the number five
""
number six  show commitment to hong kong
""
local graduate have a  edge  over their competitors over
 candidate from other sources being that
""
they show the commitment to hong kong
""
if you grow up here you develop your careers here
""
you show your commitment to hong kong employer  if you say that
 commitment to hong kong
""
and  last but not least is very important 
""
to develop positive work attitude
""
good work attitude and a high sense of responsibility
""
if you local graduates are able to develop themselves in all these
seven areas they can definitely maintain their competitive edge even in the
face of unemployment in the face of  lot of challenges from all quarters
""
this my seven
""
now i  ' m going to elaborate one by one from a to g these seven
points  okay
""
a  tut  acquire better understanding of mainland china
""
what do we need
""
how  how are you going to do it
""
now it  ' s in fact it  ' s not particularly difficult
""
first of all  participate in china related project
""
in fact when you enter  the local  univers  one of the
local university
""
in fact all local university are organizing a lot of activities
china  relate  related activities for their students 
""
make full use of this opportunity
""
china related project seminars study tour programme to enhance
your knowledge of the mainland
""
understand mainland  ' s economic social and administrative system
""
because later on when you develop your career here even if you
work in hong kong you may work in in hand in with people from  mainland
china
""
then you need to understand mainland economic social
administrative system
""
try to participate in the project
""
okay this is the first thing okay
""
second uh   tut 
""
try to undertake a short period of employment or training in the
mainland
""
to understand the work environment
""
this is the more theoretical part
""
the seminar  study tour programme and so on
""
the second part is the work environment and establish contacts
""
for instance the  career centre hong kong u every year arranges
a number of student to take up summer employment in the mainland
""
what we call china  one-word  programme
""
they work there for uh two month two and a half month and so on
""
then  they understand better the work environment
""
it  ' s difficult even if you explain to them in great detail it may
not be sufficient
""
you work there for two month then may know
""
and then establish contacts
""
this  ' s very important because employer will appreciate the 
period  of contact with the student to understand their potential their
skills and so on
""
this is the second  thing 
""
third  every day by paying attention to china related current
affairs in hong kong in the mainland and so on
""
alright because two places are so closely related
""
current china chinese affair or current affair in china will
affect hong kong
""
then it  ' s the time analysis how this issue affect hong kong
development
""
this is the   first  point
""
how do local graduate maintain their competitiveness with without
understanding  of mainland china
""
the second point b  global perspective global perspective
alright
""
you have to look beyond hong kong look beyond  china look
beyond asia and then in fact you look it up you look at the whole world
""
how
""
now again  all local university organize  exchange
programmes for their student to undertake a period of study in oversea
universities
""
or uhm they may study there for  uh as a less than three two
three months
""
they may study for whole year that   attraction  is
that you study in a foreign environment
""
then you have opportunity to experience independent living that
all by own
""
and study in a foreign environment communicate and interact with
people of a different language different culture and different customs okay
""
uh for instance hong kong u organizes the worldwide  hong kong
alright not hong kong u worldwide
""
that is different campuses  rearrange student to different
campuses in different part of the world
""
they may study in the united states uh in europe or in uh  uhm
u united kingdom and so on
""
this is the first area
""
the second area to acquire global perspective is  to join study
tour
""
again  many of uh student societies many teaching departments
uh student affairs units and so on or different local universities organize
seminars conferences held outside hong kong
""
so when you enter these local universities if you have opportunity
by all means try to attend  to participate in the seminar the conferences
held outside hong kong to understand  and appreciate different view from
different perspective
""
this is important
""
to broaden your mental horizon
""
look beyond hong kong  look beyond china and asia to different
part of the world
""
again  reading magazine newspapers listening to radio or
watching tv programme different part current current affair international
current affair
""
so update yourself
""
to keep yourself up to date   tut  of what happening in
different parts of the world
""
because in the selection interview employer may always ask you
question from uh current affairs in mainland china in different part of the
world
