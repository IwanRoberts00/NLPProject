well i guess it ' s very complicated for different group of hong kong people because many many uh uh rich people or educated  young couples or educated young man they don't found found it very  frightening or there ' re not much conflicts to them for you know unmarried young people because if they ' re educated they can you know they can uh to make some money and then you know enroll for the emigration and then they can go easily because many countries doesn't have very uh you know firm or or or strict rule to the emigration  for those people but you know as far as i know hong kong most of the hong kong people are still they like hong kong very much but they don't like china or or they want uh they don't want china to be a ruler  of this place as they thought it may and the china china government will screw up all the things in hong kong  $z laughs  you know so but for like i said for for rich people or educated young people they will not really afraid i mean be afraid of  the coming of ninety seven but for people like workers two words workers or factory workers or even some uh  youn very young people or or students uh they may be they may have  co uh conflicts because they want to go or they want to live  uhm but they could not according to the condition they have so uhm there are still a a n number of people that they really are positive they feel positive about approaching of ninety seven because uhm they still want to be in hong kong and do something uhm uhm   i think that the average number that can leave if they actually want to go i was told only one out of every ten people have the ability to leave hong kong that because of finances or lack of education that uhm very few people have a choice you know ninety percent according to that statistic have a choice that re i mean don't have a choice they have to s  they have to stay  well i think too when i ask you know taxi drivers and other people this question  about half of them say everything is going to be alright no problem i think they they they ' re trying to convince themselves that is just hong kong will always be the same you know fifty years no change and then it seems like the other one say oh it ' s going to be terrible you know i can't wait to get out of here how can this happen to us but you seem to found find very people that are in the middle  that kind of say well uh yes there ' s going to be a lot of change  it won't be the same but maybe uhm several words  in some ways there will be some good things that come i i haven't heard that yet it ' s usually just been uhm either everything is going to be okay or oh it ' s going to be terrible is anyone in your family planning to leave hong kong   yeah   uh uh  uh  couples of years ago they talk about that but i don't think they ' re now working on emigration or enrollment for their emigration but well i guess what like my parent they ' re they ' re  they think they are too old too think about that or just uh they will think well there ' s not many years left for them so they don't care what happen to them and the childrens like me as grown up and have our own decision  they try they they try to convince us but uh some of the kids in in our family told them that we want to stay in hong kong so so they you know they they give up convincing us uh to think about that you know emigration but uh but just according to what you said like uh you  several words about or talk to people seems like to be in the middle that i i guess as far as i know many people uh is in that status or in that situation not because they think that or or they have the middle uh mind that because they confuse about their future like they they hope that they want to they want china china government to be doing good in hong kong but they don't at the same time they want they don't want to live in a country  that they ' re not belongs to  uh yeah many people they don't think about emigration not because they don't want to go but at the same time they don't to live in a place that every everybody look different to them they they speak different language or even they couldn't find a good job over there or they may not be treated as equal as they they  wa they was in hong kong or you know in the same way that they live in hong kong so you know they make them to be the middle   don't you think though that uhm some people are uhm feeling that being able to have hong kong return to china that you know they use the word return to the mother land uhm we will be a part a of country again uhm is almost like you know i think as as a foreigner uh and being related to foreigners that in times past have common by force  have force their presence upon uh you know the chinese people  that they ' re one word seem to be uhm a certain attitude  which would say yes it ' s going to be good at last the foreigners are going to go home and hong kong can again be ruled by uh the chinese people without the interference of foreigners do you feel that there are some people that have those kinds of feelings as well  well in fact uh in some occasions me myself think think that way uhm sometimes i will think hong kong has been you know rule by uh british government for a long time for such a long time you know when when i was born in british government alre already been here for more than seventy years of you know time like that so suddenly or sometimes i think well now the foreigners now is going back to their own country and just as you the question you are asking that we ' re now going back to the root of you know the the the root of us you know we are chinese and we suppose to be or we are we are originally belongs to to the mainland the big land that we now don't want to don't want them so that you know just like now we are we are back to like you said back to the home sometimes i ' ll think that way too myself well i have been talk to people uh and i don't know whether  many people would think that way because maybe uh they will this this concept or this feeling will make people even more positive  approaching ninety seven uh but i guess mo most of the people that i mention have positive uhm perception about approaching ninety seven we think that way too because uhm uh many social worker or or people uh who would who do the research on young people and they ' ll think one word many people doesn't have the concept of the root of of of you know of their  identity and they ' ll because hong kong have been you know  rule by the british government for too long and like uh it ' s a very funny questions when when foreigner came to hong kong and try to  buy a souvenir to represent hong kong tut uh almost no body can find a really special thing that you can buy in hong kong to represent hong kong when they go back to their country like this well  well like if if i go to japan i ' ll buy a a little doll it looks  everybody look at the doll would will know that well you have been to japan but for for the foreigner from america or from different country when they come to hong kong they couldn't buy something back to the country to show that they have been hong kong because there ' s nothing  special about hong kong because is just a place that uhm you know  consist of different country i mean different people from different country and they work there they had they do the trading they do the  you know do the work there but if all the people go back to their own country and all the hong kong people is is left over there they don't have their identity  because they live according or they depends on all the trading  all the business happen here so they don't many young people don't have the concept or they don't have a sense of belon longing to you know their country    uhm uhm   one words  well i think that probably is because the current population has all been born under the you know rule of the british so from the very earliest memories that you would have all you can think about is what it is like to live in a uh territory that is uhm under the rule of of you know foreign country half way around the world i think though you know it ' s interesting to me that a hundred and year a hundred years ago or more when uh hong kong uh by force was taken and made in two uh uh uh a protector of the british  that at that point china was guarding itself against anything it was western you know they did not want any of the influences that were coming from the west and it it does seem at that time that the influences were almost one word negative you know the selling of opium and that of thing but now at at this present time if you go across the boarder uh they are doing everything they can they can do attract the foreigners to come because they have realized the value of uhm modern management methods uh high technology uh many of these things that have uh been in the west for a long time now now china is inviting those those foreign influences uhm to come and i think that the world will be watching hong kong  because if you look at the history of the british where in times pass they have had their colonies and then they have uh withdrawn many times the  organizational skills uh the system of law and some of the other things that the british have been able to introduce that were very positive things for the country uhm begin to go backward especially you know i can think of many other places in africa where the british before had established uhm very well run organized systems that after they withdrew their system begin to breakdown uh one word  some of the nationals then wish that the british had  never left do you think that in hong kong that the chinese can govern themselves better than the british have been able to govern them   yeah   yeah   yeah   uhm uhm  it ' s not easy to say that  i i just thought think of uh uhm a feeling of many hong  many hong kong people just like uh when you mention uh that what happen in in africa many part of africa that now hong kong people who who  will be staying in hong kong is worrying about many thing and most of the things that like like like you said british government uh in fact has brought you know many good things to hong kong and it has a development of economy you know the development of the city and all the law system seems to be very you know very good and and people are happy about the even the the law of the british government but then suddenly people realize that you know the law system has to be changed to a system which they don't find very reliable you know when we heard about you know some some uh thing happen in china uhm recently that you know make hong kong people very frighten  about the law system over there and it seems that you know even a  even a person who has hasn't commit any crime or who is not guilty would find would be found guilty because you know they don't have a very good system law system you know s this is one of the example that make many hong hong kong people uh frighten now or or they worry about and  and they don't they want to do something you know to make the chinese uh law system even similar to the british one so that they won't be afraid  when after ninety seven so it ' s quite complicated now for people who will be staying in hong kong uh approaching ninety seven uhm you know just like you mention the history of hong kong  that at the very beginning british government bring the evil things in into hong kong selling opium and bringing all the corruptions and then suddenly when ninety seven is approaching they found that british government has does many things good you know  even can overcome all the bad things they have done and now the good british government has to be going  leaving hong kong and then you know it ' s it ' s very interesting you know for for the situation for for many young i mean for many hong kong people now   i would i was with uhm an older man the other day and we were discussing these kinds of events and he uh was quite angry because  he said the uhm british have a voice and the chinese government has a voice and the british and beijing are going back and forth about many different things concerning hong kong but he felt like the hong kong people had been left out  $a laughs that they did not have the ability to help determine  their own future that their future was being determine by britain and by uhm the leaders in beijing do you feel that way or do you feel like that hong kong people had been given a voice  you you you would you make me to recall us popular song in hong kong uh s by by a pop music group the topic is the main topic is about the same that uhm  yeah he use a uh what we call a tut paradigm use a paradigm to represent the situation that there is a father arguing with the mother and left the kids behind the mother and the father is uh arguing something about the kid but in fact  the problem or the needs of the kids has been left out so the kid shout out to the parent and said father please go and mother please shut up because i have to say something you know this is the the the message of the song so one word some people will will think that way really because uh many many uhm i don't know the the term for that there is uh some people uh they will they will think that  when the british government arguing with the the beijing government  they don't they are not really uh concern about the the needs of the hong kong people they just uh arguing according to what what they will need that i mean the needs of the own government only or because of the politics problem because they are poli politician   so s well many people i mean some people will will will have this feeling really and that ' s why the election seems to be very important now in hong kong  the free election    uhm uhm   so they can have a voice  yeah and they can had have a chance even to uh to talk i mean to voice out their own needs  so long pause    well you know another question i had or thought concerns the fact that after margaret thatcher had come and they had worked out the joint declaration uhm it seems like a principle at that time they had decided that there would be what they call the through train that there would be elections that would elect uhm a group of leaders that would straddle the year nineteen ninety seven so that there wouldn't be a drastic change in nineteen ninety seven but that there would be  leadership elected several years before ninety years that would continue to serve their term across the ninety seven day and into the new sar government so that it would be a smooth transition but obviously that has all broken down and we heard last week that in fact uh the chinese government was going to dismantle the current uh legislator and the current political would all be dismantled and they would start over again what what you think about this long pause   uhm uhm   yeah  well two words when when margaret thatcher was in hong kong no was in beijing uhm you know i was quite small quite young and i didn't think about politics or  the future of hong kong uh that at that time but when when the time comes to you know now today i thought that uhm it ' s always the the way of uh administration of  chin china government always because uhm you know china government always express uh uhm an identity or or or one word they want to be very outstanding in their culture in the way of handling the whole country and they still want to keep the uhm  the country in a communist country they thought this is the best way to you know to run the country so uh i don't know who start the that start the uh the treaty or or the signing of the treaty uh at that time by margaret thatcher so you know i don't really know what what should i  comment on on this but sometimes i ' ll feel uh depress about the  you know the the ruler of the china government or the the top  person of the china government because it seems that they won't  do what they promise usually or for most of the time  $z laughs  and even for the for any citizen in china uh it they work or they do or they behave in the same way sometimes they ' ll promise something and then they won't  they i mean they won't do what they promise for examples like when you buy a property in china now it it ' s possible that you won't get the the property or even the what they promise on how big is the property or or what we will be supplying to the property and even up to fifty percent you don't have that or you won't get that even you have paid the money  one word that ' s the way that the country goes you know it seems that the whole country had the has have the way to to uh deal with the people they don't they even don't think to promise is quite important to  i mean for for human relationship so sometimes i will feel depress about this even even i think well i will be staying in hong kong and i want to be back to china and and do something but  sometime it it would it would depress me or disappoint me  uh
