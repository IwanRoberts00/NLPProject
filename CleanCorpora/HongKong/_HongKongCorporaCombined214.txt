first of all i i like to give you some uh some idea of uhm it application in the clothing industry in the past uhm maybe twenty years uh in hong kong  what i can say is that we can divide that into in four four stages i think uhm the first stage is uh what i call the the infant stage and then uh that ' s the stage that people are still uh skeptical in uh using uh computers or information technology and then the mid-eighties that uh is growing stage a lot of people are using uh computers and then later on in late in the late eighties there ' s a lot of people using uh information technology using cad systems  but coming to the nineties i think the sof software industry or the uh people using it in the clothing industry should uh should have uh some kind of breakthrough and uh i ' d like to uh  in the infant stage and uhm it is because computer ' s very expensive and uh usually uh it will cost you a million dollars in even in the seventies during that time a million dollars is very expensive one and uh in ninety i think the first application uh in using computer in the clothing industry was used by one of the leader that ' s the textile alliance limited and uh that ' s uhm in nineteen seventy-four tal installed i think the should be during that time one of the most advanced uh uh computer uh that ' s the ibm system three to give you some idea of the system three it had only sixteen k memory and uh with uhm ten megabyte of disk storage and uh during that time ten megabyte of disk storage is a very large uh disk storage and uh when i talking about sixteen k of uh memory and uh nobody will consider it ' s any any any number people are talking about sixteen megabyte right now and uhm and uh in nineteen eight uh seventy-eight i think tal install the one of the mainframe computer in uh in hong kong that is the uh system three three seventy one one five uhm although tal is a such a large company then uh still consider buying computer is very expensive  that mainframe computer is uh in fact a secondhand computer so i can say that is an infant stage people are not willing to invest a lot in computers  and uhm also there is an a need there ' s 1-word  products they installed the first uh cad systems and uh in hong kong  in nineteen seventy-eight and uh by the by the end of the the uh seventies there are a lot of computer applications and uh using mini-computer uh the most uh uh uh people use uh rank computers ncr and uh ibm systems  in the mid-eighties and uh i yes after the introduction of the ibm pc there are a lot of more standalone applications say using uhm uh ibm pc to do uh uh payroll and to do uh word processing and like that and there ' re become more computer vendor participating in this uh uh uh market and uh we have uh hewlett packard we have unisys and also ibm still is uh one of the uh uh uh leader and uh during that time a lot of people buy system for the six and system for the eight and i mentioned earlier that in nineteen seventy-eight there ' s only only one vendor produce cad systems but in the in the mid eighties there ' re a lot of uhm at least three more uhm computer maker making uh uh software and uh computer systems uh available in hong kong so people  began to have more choices  in the late eighties then uh people are talking about integrated software solutions they ' re either manufacturing uh their own software by their own in-house computer uhm department or they ' re going to uh buy some uh standard software packages and that ' s also the pc networking is uh is become mature and is also available and and then people are talking about uh they use the bundle tickets in the past and the bundle ticket cost a a lot and uh it ' s uh when they use it to calculate the piecework payroll sometimes uh it ' s quite time-consuming so people are introducing a data capturing device direct capturing the data on the soft board so that they can uhm have the payroll together with wrp more timely and uh also there ' s more cad system coming and uh pc-based uh cad system will is in fact available during that time and of course people are talking about some software just like the uh uh using industrial engineering uh software just like the uh general sewing data software that uh uh that being used in uh in 1-word  product in uh textile alliance  coming to nineties i can see that a lot more people use data capturing device in the soft core because uhm uh using bundle tickets still uh not the best way to uh to count or to do the the payroll and wip yes also there ' s a time delay in using the bundle tickets if people are very concerned on balancing their line this kind of uhm data capturing device will be very useful and if you you consider the data capturing device uhm uh in the past probably it cost you a lot of money but right now for a maybe a three or four thousand dollar you can get one terminal to put in your uh sewing uhm uh operator ' s uh machine and uh input all the data and people are moving to the open system uh develop more uhm unix-based software if uh you are not uh familiar with the computer industry unix is uh  uh right now a quite popular uh operating system uh it ' s a mainly a mini-base uh uhm standard operating system just like the if you you have the experience with the ibm pc the ibm pc ms-dos is from the pc you can call the unix system a mini-computer people are uh porting the the software into unix base and also people are you uhm developing some colour communication systems uhm before that if you have to communicate with your uh dyeing house uh on one particular colour probably you have to send a sample and uh so that they can make sure that the the right colour but right now in uh in america people are developing uh some kind of colour communication system using the high definition television set so that the colour can reproduce the uh exact tone everything ' s uhm uh instead of uh using uh some kind of courier service to send the samples around and also there if you have the chance to go to our exhibition in hong kong side you can see some uh some fashion design system and uhm the final one is the some kind of a multi-media application and uh in the past all the computer applications are mainly on text basis on uh data forcing application but right now the software technology can allow you to do some kind of imaging and uh so that you can send pictures and graphics together with the the data that is something that uh uh the clothing industry uh should look at because you can produce all the orders uh customer the confirmation in the computer but if there ' s a sketch then you have to really make the the photocopy and then attach it that will cost you a lot of money and sometimes if uh in uh designer you would like to refer a particular order in the past they cannot just go into the computer system and say that ' s the number say one two three four and understand what is in inside he have to go over the original uh file they have and get the picture out and say that is the one two three four but if the multi-media application probably you can even store all the image pictures in the computer when you key in one two three four it will choose the the garment picture directly so you you it can speed up all the all the all the uh data processing uh function because in uh this field you cannot just talking about numbers you have to talk about colours talk about uh images  uhm so much for the for the histories and uh actually i start working in uhm uh tal when uhm they installed the uh ibm system three and uhm during the past uhm i can see sixty seven years i involve uh heavily in uh computer applications in the clothing industry  my my experience with all the implementation is that you can really separate into two uh uh major part actually the first one is uhm if you cannot implement the the the any computer application there may be management problem there may be technical problem  in the management problem side i think the major changes are now under management style a lot of the factories uhm in the past are really uhm home-run or home-room business the boss knew everyone in the in the factory uh from from workers to to supervisors and because they ' re small they maintain a family-like uh business but gradually then kind of uhm old generation fades out and the second generation take take charge most of them have been uh uh educated uh quite well in the in the in in in overseas or in hong kong they introduce some new mention uh concept into the factories they expand the factory so there is a some kind of change in the management style  from a family business to a uh you can say a multi-national company some of the factories in uh in hong kong has grown to be really multi-national companies another thing is that people has some kind of tendency not to change anything if they use the same systems uh for thirty years they prefer to use it and still use it they don't want to use the computer they don't want to use the keyboards they use pens  the third thing is the lack of the management commitment  now sometimes  i can give you a some a graph like that  usually when when some computer system was introduced or it application was introduced in the in the in the factory the senior management ' s commitment will be really on the initial stages because uh it ' s the uh stage for negotiating the the the price of the the the hardware and the software and gradually after the installation of the of the computer they said okay that is uh something that should be carried out by by the by the uhm lower management in that case difficult really to motivate people to use a computer because the the senior management is is not really interested in the final result of the the the computers  of course the final thing is the in the past people are talking much too much on cost control when they introduce the the payroll system they ' ll consider how many payroll card i can save and uh i can fire so that uh that is the the saving but right now if you consider using it here ' s something that you should uh consider is to improve the efficiency really to compete with uh your competitors not really just to to consider the cost  talking about the technical problems the first one is that uhm actually the the quality of the software is usually not that good because uh computer peo people didn't really want to work in the the clothing industry they prefer to work in the banks they prefer to work with the the airlines so only seldom you can find good people working in the industry to develop software for the industry so in general i think in the past the quality of the software is not that good another another point is that it i is really related to first part  some software house may consider to start with the the the the garment industry but later on they consider that there ' re a lot of business opportunity in the in the banking sector in the video sector they switch the the business strategy to the to the to that sector and so sometimes you can see the the support service is not not that good the third part is that usually those people are not really uh working in the garment industry or the clothing industry they cannot really commun communicate uh the requirement with the uh with the end user so i can see that is the quite few technical problems  but in fact that is uh all the problems and uh then how how can we really uh uhm know whether we should uh uh uh buy this system or not  1-word i ' d like to take an uhm some kind of uh suggestion by a an harvard professor and uh he consider that the implementation risk should consist of three factors the first factor is the how well define the project ' s output  whether you know the exact uh objective of using that kind of technology using that kind of uh system i can put it as uh some kind of project definition another thing is that how much of the technology is really new to the companies some companies say uh in america are saying that edi is not new uh we can use cdi that ' s very simple but if you some technology is really new then the implementation risk will be higher if you ' re using a a manual system using a pc this is switching from a a a a manual system to a something that using computers that is uh the change of technology the third dimension is of course the project size  the larger project size the higher risk   basi basically you can you can uh have this uh risk matrix actually if you ' re using some kind of low technology uh product then the project is always at low risk but of course low risk will imply very low return on your investment so it ' s a you have to be very careful whether you you should take some kind of high risk job or just like to take some kind of low risk low risk and uh low technology uh uh task say for example the project definition on a on the colour communication iit ' s al also always not very clear and it involves some kind of high tech technology and you need some to do some kind of uh basic uh research so that kind of uhm project is a high risk project but if you can really implement them then the return will be ver very very high so it really depends on uh how you you treat a project how you measure a particular project one project may appear to be a low risk project  applying to another company may be a very high risk project so probably you have to get a very basic understanding of your company and uhm to see whether you are your company is a reas really a risk taker you ' re expecting to to have a a high return in that case you can take uh some uh some high risk project
