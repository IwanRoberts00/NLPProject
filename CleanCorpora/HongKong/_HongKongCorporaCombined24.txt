uh i think uhm if you have been to uhm the public estate in hong kong you see the crowd environment there  because uhm more than two person occupy one room just one room for uh about one hundred square feet   yeah i know you see i don't even know what a hundred square feet really is  you don't know   i don't know how big this place is  i think about half of this  this this    i think it ' s about  half of this room   no  this i think it is about four   one third i think   right  four hundred four hundred square feet here  i don't know  i ' ve no idea    yeah because  because my husband goes into the houses a lot  but i ' ve never been and i think as i ' m just very curious cos i think it ' ll be quite interesting   uh uhm  actually living is the s situation ' s quite uhm  quite crowded not so good   yeah  there ' re too many peoples living in one house some of our friends are have this experience they live in a house how much    uhm  uh about one hundred square feet but there are seven  people in the unit   seven people     well that  exactly  yeah   yeah  i think uh it ' s about your kitchen it ' s really one word     the size of my laughs   yeah   the size of your kitchen   yeah  so uhm everyone don't like to stay at home  so you you can     that ' s right everybody eats out and on the streets at night   yes so you can see many people  when there ' s a holiday    yeah  yeah yes  you go out  you go uh one word     every one goes out to either to the shopping center or yeah it ' s it ' s very interesting   yeah  actually because of finding house is very hard in  hong kong    i know in hong kong i know  but do you think that price will always go up and up and up  yeah but that is not sh   uh not not right now i think  temporarily  in the short term it won't go too much but uh maybe after nineteen ninety-seven if people find that hong kong still uh still is a great place to live in so maybe the uh uh price will continue to go up    right   i know  i know i mean that i ' ve the you know the price of a a village house now  uhm uhm   new a new flat in a village house is two point one to one floor just one floor   one floor and it ' s three hundred square feet  two point one million i put this into english money two that ' s two hundred thousand pounds you could buy you could buy a nice house in london with that money or you could buy a very big house in the country   uhm   uhm uhm    i mean i would i would spend maybe fifty thousand pounds  on a house  uhm uhm    s that ' s uh it ' s four times  uhm uhm   two words i mean when you think about it speech inaudible  huh huh huh huh   all of that has been built in less than two years   there was nothing   because uhm i have i have one friend she her her family has spent about ten million for uhm a apartment  three floors   for an apartment  three floors but it ' s not very big about two thousand feet is that right    yeah  yeah   total it ' s total   that ' s all  yeah   so   so     big for hong kong isn't it  yeah yeah but actually the uh the house is not so big because a lot of the areas are are the stairs   yeah yeah for this house because before it used to be like for one family and now it ' s for two families   uhm uhm  two family for uh in this house     we live upstairs and downstairs another  family live  $b cleared his throat  but there is actually a lot of space but they don't really arrange anything  we have we have big bathroom   oh i see   uhm   uhm  uhm   what for we have a big kitchen what for we have this big space here   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   how many rooms are there    three words  there ' s just one bedroom you see  uh here   one bedroom   yeah  then ha how about the baby   well he sleep with us  oh   yeah but uhm  and there ' s these two rooms here they ' re so small they can't get a bed in them  uhm uhm  uhm uhm what it ' s for store room     two words  well we use them as store rooms  oh   but if if someone has thought about it they would have made the kitchen and the bathroom and turned them into small rooms and then you ' ll have two more   uhm uhm uhm   yeah  big rooms when you choose this building did you uhm consider the transportation   will it cost much time for you to transport to the city    uhm  yes i mean i always knew it would be bad  but you you know because before i ' ve worked in central i ' ve worked in two words  but my husband works in tai po  uhm uhm   so it ' s not so difficult for him  uhm uhm then uhm   yes  before you go to h the university of hong kong you have been to work   yeah  uhm uhm in the central   yeah mainly  as a secretary   yeah  uhm uhm do you think the rhythm of this uh city life as unique   yes but i ' m not a city person i mean lots of people are quite happy living there   but i don't  i was born in the country and i think i ' ll always stay in the country city people seems to know how what to do in the city   but i never know what to do i just want to go home   laughed you know   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  because the environment is rather contrastive   yeah you you know you ' ve heard that you know people city people they walk around shops for a while   uhm uhm   uhm uhm    and they go to maybe they go to pubs and maybe they go to sport center  i mean i don't know what they do laughed  because   uhm uhm  do you know many uhm english people in hong kong or     not not really  no   not really how about uh chinese   probably more but not very many  uhm uhm   my neighbours my neighbours here are all are chinese  oh i see she is al uh he is also the uhm govern government official   yeah yeah  uhm i don't know many english people one word i think you were in agnes ' class  yes   she asked me if i take the course for fun or for  yes i i wonder why you have take her  course  because uhm how how do you find this course $b laughed     seriousness   yeah  i think it was very interesting  very interesting   yeah because in a way it was quite simple but the objective was to make you think about what we didn't you know what you you understand as normal   uhm   uhm    and the kind of the the the s the s of the  just the behaviour of society it was a good course but she asked me you know do i know many people no i don't because i don't inaudible speech    uhm uhm  do you have uh any question to ask us about uhm the hong kong chinese or uhm   how long have you been in hong kong   uh since nineteen ninety   uh huh   since nineteen ninety that ' s four years  almost four years  uh before that you lived in london   yeah no well england but not london   england  countryside   countryside  oh  i think i have been to england runs once a while but uh it ' s very long time ago    where  uhm uhm uhm i don't have much uh memories for this but uh i just been to the uh city side of london   right   but   not the countryside i ' ve heard that uhm the weather of eng england is not quite good because there ' s always foggy or  yeah     well you you know like today  like today     this is quite like an english day  is it   it ' s very cloudy in the morning and it rains and then it ' s sunny   yeah   huh   but uh i i think uhm because many people said that uh english is very bor is very bored people boring people  because  yeah laughed because they always uhm uh conscious about politeness just like don't like uhm a a uhm an american    probably   one word not all english people are all conscious about being polite  more conservative do you mean    tut  uh  they they they said that because i don't i don't uh know one english people except you    right right i mean well some english people are polite some aren't  some aren't   i don't i don't really know that  that ' s hard to assess   uhm uhm  so how do you think uh the people in hong kong are they polite or   oh  awful   it ' s a very difficult  to get a general conclusion because   from a from an english perspective people here can be very rude  uhm   but my sort of politeness is not important in cantonese societies so you know   uhm uhm   just the culture is different   culture is different so yes i mean i ' ve i find people rude but that ' s my judgment on you know based on a on a  on an english view you know english stand in lines for everything   two words  they ' re the you know the world ' s greatest  for lining up    uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   so when people don't line up it you know it it ' s desperately annoying but it ' s it ' s not the way people behave here so  if it ' s it is it ' s to me is rude but for everyone else it ' s quite normal  $b laughed  and in fact i ' m desperately rude too   yeah   uhm uhm uhm uhm  uhm uhm   i ' m when we go back to england we have to remember not to push people on the train  uhm uhm   and not to kind of go like  $b laughed you know push people out of the way and   because  people pushing around    yeah   i also find hong kong people are impatient maybe it ' s due to the uhm tense life yeah   yeah   city life yeah    yes possibly yeah  always they ' re very busy to to to eat to play or to entertain   never never stood still   yeah   yes probably  from uhm i ' ve i find that uhm they may find uh the  foreigners more superior and in the past but now uhm sometimes i ' ve i think that they will uhm got they will get uhm sent some sentiments towards uhm foreigners do you do you think     why do you think that  uhm i i   foreigners are basically one word people  inaudible speech in the cantonese society  there ' s a lot more people now who are either married to cantonese people or who speak cantonese  and there ' s a lot of students at the university foreign students  <[2 who are one word in cantonese   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  yeah even the lecture lecturers   yes i mean some of my neighbours here they ' re all they all  one word cantonese maybe because they have cantonese wives   uh   uhm    but not all of them  but but as i said it isn't it isn't too bad  i think that makes the difference and also ten years ago we ' re not foreigners we ' re very very stupid one word    very stupid but that ' s part of british colonial ' s  one word  i mean people of people in england have a very strange view  of what it ' s like to work in overseas  i mean the they seem to think we get paid such  one word money that   i mean it ' s it ' s it ' s quite amazing they don't realize that it actually means to pay more  one word  we ' re we ' re quite well paid we don't earn as much as they think we do   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   huh huh   uhm   huh huh  uhm uhm because the expenses one word     yes and also we work for the government not for the big private bank  uh huh   you know two words that ' s a lot of difference  uhm uhm   but then people there won't understand  uh i have met a canadians who ' s a teacher and one  one word sh when she uh visit hong kong uh we entertaining her and to uh take her to the places the scenari to uh to the scenario spots and she mention that she is quite uh brave a lot of people say that because she only herself come to asia  and in their view asia is a very dangerous place because uhm uhm i have uh we have read one book burmese   burmese d  yes yes  because uhm i i found that many book uh foreigners find of asian is very dirty one word and they will uh know some one word tools to  $b laughed hurt people so    burmese days yes  the view the view of the west certainly is that a asia or anywhere foreign not just asia i mean it ' s  it ' s it ' s can be very dangerous   uhm uhm   yeah  uhm uhm   but i think that ' s fairly typical i mean people think that going to england is very dangerous but it ' s not that dangerous  three words  i ' ve spent a long time in asia by myself and asian people find me very strange because they prefer company  sometimes   uhm uhm  you ' re just yourself   yeah  you have been to uhm where  anywhere   around    yeah around i mean before i got married but  and i think that seeing a place as as being dirty  i mean i think that ' s very narrow narrow view of asia there ' s a lot of more interesting things to say about the country than the fact that it ' s dirty i mean india india was dirty india is dusty but not full of plastic   because a they don't use plastic and tin cans  and b if they did use them they will be somebody recycling and make money that you know that there ' ll be poor person who can use this  so i mean we ' re just we had our holiday in sri lanka again because we just like it  and this time my husband is not okay and i was really worried all laughed going to make the holiday  two words  but she said the same as us  it ' s dusty but it ' s not dirty  i mean   uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  because uhm it is the living standard cause it dusty it is not the way    yes  it is not the way people are  yeah  yeah   uhm uhm     i mean  i don't i think i usually speech intelligible very high standard of hygiene they would be appalled at english hygiene  uhm uhm   you know i mean it gets cold in the winter and maybe some english people don't take a bath everyday  uhm  $a and $c laughed    which which is actually not that uncommon   uhm uhm   uhm uhm    but here people will be very surprised  well because the weather is much hotter     yeah that ' s right  it ' s wet and it ' s wet     that ' s right  you need to you know it ' s untidy but our people are famous of the fact they ' re not so clean either so it ' s a bit silly i mean hong kong is very polluted  three words dirty  uhm uhm inaudible speech  eric uh uh how do you feel about the english when you were  uh in london well because i was so young uh maybe just how old is he uh how old are you   about fourteen forty fourteen something and i found that the buildings are quite great i like to see the uh british styles uh buildings but uhm it ' s very wet  all of the times are foggy when i was there     was that spring time  uh around spring time i think is it spring speech by unknown speaker     yes   yes something   it could be cold wet windy  very cold yes  and but the streets are very clean  much better than hong kong uh the people i don't have much  feelings about the people   how how about two words     lots of lots lots of people are quite rude so  you know as much as i say people here are rude they are rude in the same way  uh huh   and in fact very very distant you know they never say hello to shopkeepers   two words in a small town people would say hello to the shopkeeper you know which is  inaudible speech   uhm uhm   but   yeah  yeah   it ' s very anonymous it ' s not really inaudible speech  is it uh do you mean that uhm english uhm people uhm in living in eng uh london uhm think that they are more superior or   not really i mean i don't i don't think it ' s superior i think london london is a community of people made up of people who don't two words   that ' s the culture  oh   people go there to you know uh   you have to work   i mean people like inaudible speech ever  there are some people doing that  one word but the majority of people are just  one word i mean adam has lived and worked in london and i have lived and worked in london   uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   but neither of us have ever considered living and working there for for the rest of our lives  and i think that ' s the main main problem that no there ' s no uhm there ' s no neighbourhood  uh huh   because uh because there ' re so many people who are  foreigners in the neighbourhood just other people from other parts of england   uhm uhm  uhm uhm oh in this way uh hong kong has a similar uh   type be because people are moving around all the time   and a lot of new people come who live next to uh next to you but you don't know who he is or who she is    yeah   that ' s right   that ' s right  that ' s right  i don't know my neighbourhood  $b laughed    not at all no do you know the people who live next door  no no  no we we even don't say hello to each other   right  yeah i mean in london i lived there was a house with  three flats and we say hello to our neighbours but nothing else  uhm uhm   and our immediate neighbours mainly because they were of similar age that we one word we were familiar with them with some of them but you didn't socialize with them and you never  $b laughed   uhm uhm  and there ' s a chinese saying that uh neighbour is uhm is uhm import more important than your relatives but in in in hong kong i i find that this uhm statement is not quite applicable    anymore   yeah  yeah   yeah i think so  because uh i think uh hong kong is moving to western  life   yeah yeah  is it concerned about the building structure of the  $b laughed because uh as before the public housing in hong kong is door to door   yeah  but uh now individual individualism is more important in hong kong and the privacy    yeah  yeah  so that the people doesn't uhm interact much with the neighbour   but i i just found that uh my neighbourhood don't bother to say anything to you uhm  you mean uh you mean your neighbourhood   right now  just   yes  yes right now   have you lived there long  uhm uhm   have you lived there a long time  uh for one and a half years but they  there there are several sons in uh the family they they just uh watching at my house through their windows  so i ' m very afraid  $b laughed   no no no  is it their curiosity   yeah  $b laughed  i don't know why they are doing such things   nothing else to do i suppose i i wouldn't like it at all   it ' s it ' s it ' s quite ridiculous i think   yes  we did we want to keep our privacy but i don't know    yeah  it ' s also it ' s very difficult because everything is so close together  yes do you try to interact with them oh no laughed   no  borrow something from them or   because the their image their im their  impression is quite pop pop here means cheeky or lacking respect  inched   yes yeah  yep in my opinions what i haven't uh i have not been uh living in any public housing before but i found that most of my friend who live in the public housing areas are more close and more uh mer more close to their neighbourhoods and they have they know a lot of people around living around there   yeah  but in my case i ' m live i was live in two words  i am not was i am live in mei foo   right  uh it ' s a private estate so we don't have     yes   have you visited mei foo   i know i read that  oh yeah  $b laughed    i know a lot about him three words     we don't have much uh interaction with our   re friend with our re uh our neighbourhood    yeah  yeah  but i think in some new housing estate there is the residents are always the the same generation for example for the uh small family maybe uh the neighbourhood have uh have some children there is three words  oh     yes yeah i do i think so maybe mothers and small children tend to know other mothers  with small children inaudible speech by different speakers  even even though i uh i haven't even though a a boy living next to me uh who is with my age i i don't have much chance to uh play with them not like uh in the public housing area we can run uh in the corridors and so on we cannot because the corridors are so short and so narrow  uhm uhm     yeah  and once you get out you push the button then get downstairs    yeah   do you open your door at all no close it but in public housing  all the time    all the doors are just air open   yes because the uhm the air is not so   that ' s right  circulate   and also because they use the extra space of the k the the corridor  yes   usually it ' s you know some furniture and some things   yeah well fair enough if you a very small space you have to utilize what ' s available   one word much one word  laughed  what is uhm uh how is your living environment in england   uh that ' s a difficult question  $a and $b laughed  you have to move around laughed    well my husband has a flat in london and i have never lived in that flat and i don't know three words  uhm uhm   but you see all my belongings are still in my mother ' s house so i ' ve never three words  so once you get married you come to hong kong   i got married here   oh in hong kong  oh    yeah so uhm my things are still in my mother ' s house and i want to do something about it all laughed  i don't know what but anyway because now we have uh we have this flat which is  i ' m sure you all hear about the lost three words people lost a lot of money in foreign housing you  know and things like that but our house is now worth about fifteen thousand pounds less i think   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  oh less   hundred and fifteen thousand dollars less   whoa  uhm uhm   so well if we sell it then we still have to pay the mortgage   uhm uhm   uhm uhm    so there ' s no point in selling it  yeah   you might as well own it  so we ' ve paid two words mortgage  about two words you rent it out   my sister ' s living in it  oh   well speech inaudible  yeah uhm   because too many people with our problem and  the people would have to move house two words lose jobs and too many four words  so if three words you know you can say the rent is fifty pounds a week and they say oh well thirty   uhm uhm   uhm  uhm uhm   it ' s like well you know if we know the charity   so it was very difficult to find a tenant and now my sister lives in she pays us twenty one word  $b and $a laughed  but in hong kong is    multiple words she can she can pay us for the next twenty years but she still owes us a fair bit   then   then   but it ' s different in hong kong it depends where we are   i don't know well because it ' s multiple words so much and uh is your wedding very simple in hong kong  is there any ritual wedding your wedding in hong kong    well  uh it was very simple for a lot of reasons   right  because i have     i got married in tai po all laughed  i heard you i i i heard uh in the tutorial that your uhm your mother didn't come   my mother didn't come and my dad didn't  two of my sisters came  $b-clears-throat and adam ' s father didn't come but you see both both our mothers came out later in the year   uhm  uhm   for a a lot of reasons but yeah it was mainly adam ' s friends  and the few people i knew and my sisters   but then but in hong kong uh the situation is very different uhm there are many marriages one word  $b laughed  you can you can hold your sister case    uh huh laughter  her sister just got married too too many rituals like uhm the preparation lasted for about two months   yeah  first of all is the housing is one of the three words them to get married because uh when they uh get the house from the home home speech inaudible   yes   yes yes yes     yes yes yes  and then they get the health one word  and then they go to uh to sign the one word  yeah the  register    register  the register and once and then uhm until they get the house they decide to uh prepare for the banquet  prepare the banquet    yeah  yeah  but then uhm and many ritual before the night uhm uhm uhm uhm and like have you ever read some books about the ritual   i know a little bit but not  likes uh seuhng tohng cantonese term designating one ritual practiced in traditional marriage  do you know put something on the head all laughed  direct translation many rituals are one word   rather than practiced    yeah  yeah  yeah and she has done uhm project on uhm   ah right running a banquet for doctor for doctor evans or just for interest  for doctor evans   yes   for doctor evans  he found it very interesting   yeah  well you know what you ' ve been doing he was he was doing some research but he was just getting the students to collect all the information all laughed for him    i think that ' s the practice of uh  lots of uh tutors or professor    yes  yeah  and uh it is a practice in hong kong or in other chinese uh society that uhm the relative have to buy uh have to buy uhm many jew  jewellery or gold or you you you get married   right  so it is uhm i think it is uhm one typical case in hong kong   yeah  uhm uhm   yes  also the gift cheque all-laugh  you have to pay for the banquet dinner  yes
