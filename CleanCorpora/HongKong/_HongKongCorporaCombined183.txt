well a very good evening and welcome to the macau jockey club ' s taipo racecourse once again sand racing this evening ten races on the surface and the going is no more watering at the moment runners behind the barriers for race number two it is the otaki handicap class six gallopers thirteen hundred metres and we do have a riding change in this race number six panda power in fact the horse on screen is to be ridden by robbie burke now just quickly our commentators selections for race two harry troy has gone two one nine and four universe to defeat little big john house of fortunes and golden apple harry uh franko lau sorry has gone nine six and seven house of fortunes to defeat panda power and buddha venture uh i found it a very very tough race uh little big john you always got the impression he was always going to uh come up favourite but not one i could really be tipping or be very confident about uh but when you look at the race uh pretty hard to find horse to beat him but i thought number eight was a touch of value ever gaining he ' s a ten year old but seldom too far away so if you are getting twelve to one about him which i think is a decent quote panda power is a horse that uh i wanted to watch closely in the race because he ' s an erratic customer and can play up uh quite badly but  tonight uh he really has behaved which is quite unusual he can get stirred up he can be uh a big uh problem on the way to the gates they ' ve walked him to the gates and he ' s standing there as quiet as a lamb so far uh so that ' s a very positive factor for panda power because usually he just gets far too worked up and i thought uh house of fortune was another deserved of respect so i ' m going eight six and nine for race two quickly we ' ll go through the chances for tonight uh probably about a minute until they start loading race one a withdrawal easy partner is out replaced by the standby ogm ' s power barrier nine robbie burke rode just repeating in this second event robbie burke now rides number 6 panda ' s power unfortunately bradley stewart suffering a fall at track work this morning our next change comes in race four number six billionaire is out replaced by the first standby decent exposure barrier eleven chris maund in the saddle race five take out number eight smartie race five number eight  our final change comes in race ten and it ' s a riding change number two cheers partner is now chris maund our feature tonight is race seven the andan handicap a terrific class one contest over a thousand metres two of our top rated horses in macau best brothers and gold world winner both from the leyshan yard in the field of course best brothers eyeing an invitation to hong kong this year and gold world winner the current sand king we now have the red light for race two just repeating franko lau has gone nine six and seven harry troy two one nine and four not a race i was uh packed with confidence but i went eight ever gaining  although i did go for him because he was good odds he ' s now been smashed down to five to one but eight ever gaining for me due to consistency six panda power because he has settled down and nine house of fortunes as you can see they are loading for this second event as we now cross over to harry troy thanks steve and a very good evening everyone the runners are loading quickly for the second of the night the otaki handicap and we are having some problems getting buddha venture into line but he goes in quite easily now panda power goes forward we ' ve got two out of line uh universe and golden apple universe is going to jump the favourite at about two point two now they are attending to a runner in the centre it could be ever gaining that ' s he in the pink cap  still some problems just cannot quite see from our vantage point what is the problem here we ' ve got a runner out wide causing some trouble that ' s definitely ever gaining also towards the inside panda power not quite locked away that ' s the problem  and he ' s in fact he might have been locked away well uh we ' ve got one down so that ' s even worse and that ' s golden apple that ' s gotten down no it ' s not golden apple it is gate nine it ' s ah some toy for sure and certain so that ' s the problem he decided to sit completely down this horse has been a problem horse in the past and they ' ve had to bring a couple of runners out either side of him and for sure and certain he ' s going to be a late scratching in fact he ' s off the big board already now the favourite at around two point two almost an even money quote for universe he jumps from gate four second favourite little big john from barrier one now we ' ve got to reload these other runners now that they ' ve got ah some toy out of the way  at the back we ' ve got panda power and buddha venture other runners have been in there quite a while and they stand up okay  and ah some toy his name disappeared off the infield  one-word board quite quickly before they even got him to his feet now let us have a look what is going on over there buddha venture goes forward panda power ' s going to be the last one to link up  set and they ' re off and running at long last getting away well on the inside was little big john house of fortune is very prominent with universe likewise ever gaining and his stablemate buddha venture is going to be quoted five and six deep as they link up to the course proper panda power wasn't away that well but has recovered and parks right on the back of the leaders as they go by the nine hundred about two back then golden apple who ' s back in the early part today followed by viking hero jubilation the tailender but only six and seven off the lead in front house of fortune ' s eight hundred metres out and he travels nicely a neck away ever gaining racing more prominent tonight  crowded a bit deep buddha venture little big john enjoys a nice run he ' s fourth the rail splitting them in the centre is universe a bit deep golden apple by the six hundred he ' s having a tough run followed then by under plenty of pressure panda power followed then by viking hero and losing touch jubilation  five hundred out house of fortune ' s in front he ' s off the bridle he leads a neck in second spot ever gaining enjoying a lovely run little big john he ' ll need a little bit of luck from there but he travels well and just behind then universe well into the straight  and house of fortune ' s the pilot little big john raced up now and puts the head in front coming late then panda power and running on down the outside buddha venture but little big john ' s shot away  150 out little big john ' s out by a length and a half panda power buddha venture running on but little big john is going to be a little bit too strong for them little big john he ' s only to last to win by three parts panda power third over the line is going to be buddha venture rushing home late then was uh viking hero universe followed then by weakening away was ever gaining followed then by house of fortune  next over the line was golden apple and jubilation last oh he was travelling very well in the run for danny beasley just needed an out and just had to give ever gaining it was a little bit of an nudge to get into the clear and dashed away put the issue beyond doubt  and he raced nicely clear little big john getting into second panda power and that did jump the favourite quinella one and six returning around seventy dollars buddha venture ' s ran on okay for third  universe i think got held up coming to the turn he ' s run on well late but right down the outside viking hero has made it interesting for third but placings will be one six and seven with viking hero winding up in fourth one six seven one six seven and ten in fact and the winner number one little big john  a five year old bay new zealand bred gelding by jetball from the wild rampage mare raging and danny beasley rode for k k sin just a bit too good for them down here in the class six ranks danny beasley  four wins on the weekend took his tally to 13 and getting on the scoreboard very early tonight he ' s got some nice rides later on number six is second panda power robbie burke for wing leung  number seven winding up in third buddha venture hiden cheung tai lam and officially fourth number ten viking hero horace lam for alan leung  one six seven and ten and the late scratching of number three ah some toy  universe did jump the favourite but little big john after enjoying a lovely run throughout and he got into the clear at the right time with a bit to good for them one six seven and ten here ' s steve long time between drinks for little big john it ' s uh well over eighteen months since he last scored in fact his only win in macau and that was class four  on that night they blazed in front and he came uh just came with a late run down the outside even then really just plodded plodded to the line and he ' s been uh a disappointing horse for a while but uh here he is in class six and he ' s just been a little too strong for this field and it was a pretty weak contest all the same  little big john returns
