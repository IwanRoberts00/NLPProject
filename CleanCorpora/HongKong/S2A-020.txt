""
well a very good evening
""
welcome to the macau jockey club  ' s taipo racecourse
""
we have tuesday night  ' s sand racing
""
ten events on that surface and runners at the moment behind the
barriers for race number two
""
it is the tipperary handicap class
""
six gallopers  over thirteen hundred metres
""
a withdrawal in this race number eight game boy is out 
""
we  ' ll of course bring you a replay of race one in around ah twenty
minutes 
""
and we  ' re not far away from the blue light for this second event
""
""
quickly our commentators selections for race number two 
""
franko lau likes the way of two all come for rambo tse and k c wong
to defeat seven gay centennial first up for the joe lau stable and number six
free and comfort for third two seven and six for franko lau
""
harry troy going for number three always good 
""
he has come ah up favourite for the race at twenty seven dollars
from number seven gay centennial and two all come  three seven and two for
harry troy as we do get the blue light 
""
and ah in this race i  ' m willing to go for value here and he is in
fact the outsider of the field number ten yau win 
""
uhm it  ' s a race where from number six free and comfort up
""
all the horses have one thirty one plus pounds
""
then we have gay centennial one twenty eight and harmony and yau
win with ah the bottom weights one one four 
""
don't think harmony  ' s a chance in the race but  as far as yau
win  ' s concerned he  ' s a horse that can race on the speed and go forward and
i thought if sammy hyland could get the horse out and running with one one
four he could actually take quite a bit of catching in the race
""
with all these favoured runners having to do the chasing with the
very big weights on top  he  ' s a bit of a query over thirteen hundred
metres yau win but i  ' ve got a feeling tonight just might be a little more of
an advantage to be an on pace runner and that looks the case with him so 
on that score i thought number ten yau win at value could run well from
number two all come
""
looks too well graded at this mark in class six and my next best
was number six free and comfort  ten two six  always good
""
the favourite has a chance but he is only five to two and he is
going to be a long way back in the running so he will need a lot of luck so i  ' m
just willing to leave him out at a very short quote 
""
ten two and six are my selections 
""
quickly go through the changes for tonight  ' s programme
""
ah a minute until we get the red light for race two 
""
in the first race number four all smooth was out replaced by the
standby number four was hung fat barrier

""
yau win driven straight to the front by sammy hyland and he  ' ll
take them to the course proper from grizzly supreme

free and comfort happy way midfield and starting to lose ground followed then

free and comfort around the outside always come and always good followed by
bullseye 
""
gay centennial straightens up in front as they uh run to the two
hundred a length in advance of grizzly supreme 
""
 fr  free and comfort closing down the outside with always

""
grizzly supreme the danger

""
gay centennial taking the prize for ricky choi and joe lau second
will go the way of number five grizzly supreme and late on the scene will be
 number two all come not too far away always good and free and comfort
""
""
so it  ' s seven five two and six seven five two and six after the
running of race number two 
""
and gay centennial had done well since joining the joe lau stable
""
""
the work had picked up quite a a go good bit 
""
and always has been a little bit weak in the past but travelled
nicely today and when popped the question found plenty over the concluding
stages  grizzly supreme  ' s run a much improved race down in the class six
ranks
""
and all come  has run on okay for the minors  winner number
seven gay centennial
""
he  ' s a four year old dark bay brown american bred gelding by bobo
star from lucky optimist and ricky choi rode for joe lau 
""
number five grizzly supreme eureka rosa de silva rode for joe
murphy 
""
and number two winding up in third all come rambo tse k c wong 
""
officially fourth number uh six free and comfort
""
he was prominent throughout
""
just weakened away over the final stages 
""
and it  ' s two and a quarter by three quarters as we await the
dividends 
""
""
might be another question to see this horse placing a very
close win and place here
""
gay centennial  hammered for the win late ah all come odds on
""
then they came for gay centennial has eventually jumped odds on and
that two and seven q was backed if unbeatable 
""
and well i wasn't far off number number seven wins gay centennial
sixteen thirty the win and sixteen twenty the place beating number five
""
and ah that is grizzly supreme at twenty seven fifty  two all
come running in third at fifteen thirty  five and seven q six hundred and
eighty seven dollars the tierce returning two thousand four hundred and
nineteen  two and a quarter lengths the winning margin three quarters
between second and third 
""
and they  ' ve run one twenty three point three which is two seconds
outside of the class record held by parrot king 
""

""

thirty 
""
six hundred and eighty seven
""
q two thousand and four hundred and nineteen dollars the tierce 
two and a quarter by three quarters one twenty three point three the run time
""
""
well always good was ah favourite throughout betting however  ah
the money first of all came for all come number two he was odds on and then
after ah the barriers had opened 
""
it all came for gay centennial who was hammered down to that odds
on quote and  given a nice ride by ricky choi 
""
virtually ah no speed in the race so the speedy yau win leading but
he was a spent force a long long way out 
""
left gay centennial ah in front grizzly supreme of course also in a
forward position
""
he was doing the chasing but  at the end of the day gay
centennial being able to ah keep clear of him and all come running on late to
grab that third position ahead of free and comfort 
""
and always good a little disappointing under the big weight failed
to run on 
""
""
has been a bit disappointing always good 
""
grizzly supreme  ' s ran okay because he was under a bit of pressure
six hundred out but he raised another effort and he  ' s put a little bit of
value into t and q combinations 
""
in the early part always good was a little slow into stride 
and he got back with not much speed harmony 
""
and ah very hard ridden happy way  straight to the front yau
win
""
thought he would lead them 
""
thought he might have went a little further then he did but  he
gave out very early in the race
""
and he leads as they run in to the back by four lengths from
grizzly supreme 
""
gay centennial up on the outside of grizzly supreme who travelled
very nicely throughout for ricky choi and shortly after  he goes forward
to sit at the girth of yah win 
""
free and comfort wasn't too far away 
""
happy way midfield the rails 
""
now on the back of them was bullseye and always good was just
starting to take off and and circle the field behind him was harmony 
""
and also back in that rearward brigade was all coming
""
he has made up some ground late 
""
down the side yau win about to call it a night and getting to the
front gay centennial 
""
grizzly supreme raising another effort albeit very hard ridden 
""
ah free and comfort on the outside 
""
here  ' s all come and always good with their runs right around the
outside but they  ' ve only just ran on fairly 
""
and as they straighten gay centennial gave a little kick 
""
grizzly supreme the only real chaser 
""
free and comfort and down the outside all come  ' s made up a little
bit of ground with always good
