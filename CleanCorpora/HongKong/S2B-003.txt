a call for an early chinese endorsement of the airport
financing plan
bill clinton says it ' s time to change america
and ross perot ' s departure from the presidential race
good evening
thanks for joining us
china has been urged to first endorse the financing plans for the
chek lap kok airport itself while efforts to resolve differences over the
airport rail link continue
that ' s according to the chief secretary sir david ford today
he led a government briefing aimed at wooing businessmen to invest
in airport core projects
sir david told the gathering of businessmen that doubts and
uncertainties hampering the airport core program must be removed by reaching
full agreement on all the disputed issues statement by sir david ford
sir david noted that beijing has proposed the sixty eight billion
dollar airport site preparation contract go ahead before a full agreement on
the provisional airport authority ' s financial plan which involves the
building and running of the chap lap kok airport itself speech by sir
david ford 
only that would give international financiers confidence to back
the airport project
so the new british proposal to the airport talks is for beijing to
agree to the paa ' s financing first speech by sir david ford 
hard-selling the twenty two billion dollar airport rail link at the
same function was mtr corporation chairman hamish mathers speech by
hamish mathers 
and secretary for the treasury k y yeung tried to allay concerns
over the inflationary impact of the airport core program
the entire acp is likely to end the trend inflation
rate as measured by the by the gdp deflator by little more than half a
percentage point over the medium time
yeung said the acp ' s potential inflationary impact on the
building and construction industry is buffered by the special scheme
of importing labour for the acp
a scheme that ' s a controversial hot potato in itself
the governor chris patten has again called for an early
agreement on the financial arrangements for the airport project

climax earlier today with a triumphant speech from presidential candidate

president this fall ending his campaign before it even officially began
in new york delegates reacted to the news with a mixture of joy and
apprehension that the polls now show clinton clearly out front and the timing
of the announcement couldn't have been better coming just before clinton ' s
all important acceptance speech

perot ' s announcement dramatically alters the campaign turning it
into a traditional two way race

supporters

withdrawal has benefited clinton the most
