$a-laughs  friends who let me use the computer in the middle of the night   $a-laughs   uhm i know   uhm   yes born place  no you are welcome for that because because you are you are really very nice for example out of all exchange students because i really think that if you are an exchange student i expect you to to have a lot of communication with local students and also uh participate in hall activities  you so if you you are so  you are so you always alone in your own room i don't think it ' s it is suitable because you are you you wouldn't learn much thing from this  uhm  and we are and we have some plans for this holiday our our group will go to shenzhen but for two days only    uhm uhm   uhm uhm  shenzhen  yes   when  china uh it ' s on twenty-seven to twenty-eight two days only   oh our hall or our floor   uhm  yeah no no our group   your group  o camp group  yeah    o camp group oh i see i see i shall maybe i see you there because my family na are going on a tour to china

get here as he said on the fifteenth  uhm   my mum and my sister get here on seventeenth  oh   my brother get two words twenty first   wa  why don't they come back together   oh because uh because people have school have their work  they want to get here when they can  but but the worst thing is we are going back differently both-laugh  i go back one word  i go back by myself my mum and sister my brother my dad both-laugh  it ' s because we all bought our ticket different time   oh   oh   it ' s really  oh i see you you buy tickets at different place also    wa  because we all in different places  my dad work in different place my my brother go to school at different place   i see   uhm  oh which     oh god  you you mother and father live at in different place   not all the time  not  $a-laughs most of the time   most of the time  oh   maybe because he ' s he ' s away on business a lot  oh i see  so your your father and mother both of them are chinese it ' s is it true  $a-laughs  sometimes i ' m confused  $a-laughs     yeah  oh really did i look japanese  yes   really  yes a little   how do i look japanese unidentified-speaker  really people say that my sister looks japanese unidentified-speaker   yes both of you   both of  yeah   people say that i look more chinese than my sister  yes it ' s true yeah but you ' re you two look alike   uhm  everyone said that we look alike these were my my mom and my dad   uhm   uhm  uhm   my both-laugh  no my dad and my mom both-laugh  you you have to show up two words point it to the wrong person both-laugh  so you are going to australia alone   yeah  uhm you think it ' s dangerous   no  because you travel a lot   all the time   wa    no uhm i just come in hong kong by myself  you know i ' ve learn to be independent    and learn to know what is safe and what isn't safe  you know i mean i ' m not going to go out with nobody and by myself   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm it ' s the first time you you went back to hong kong for such a long time   it ' s the first time i have been to hong kong  it ' s true   true  oh   i ' ve never been to hong kong  so did you travel a lot one word     no  you didn't   i have no money  oh  $a-laughs    i have no money     so she your whole whole activity is in the hall   yes i have no money  oh i just i just think that you have been to hong kong for a lot of times and so that it you you seem so accustomed to the hong kong culture and everything   well you know why that is because we there is a lot of hong kong uh people who immigrated to canada uhm   a lot of them come to vancouver which in whe in which where i live so i mean there is even a yaohan center where i live which is $a-laughs you know there is a karaoke there so i guess i ' m used to seeing a lot of chinese   people like uh i go to uh a mall call aberdeen centre   uhm   oh  oh   and it ' s just like pacific place but ten times smaller  both-laugh  it ' s all chinese people alright  so i ' m mean you just seeing them   uhm  yes when i go to vancouver i also see a lot of chinese people around in the restaurant in the shopping mall   yeah yeah no it i guess for me is different that ' s part why i fit in so well whether i can change it because i ' m not entirely a foreign student  because i ' m chinese i ' m speak chinese to you i try to  $z-laughs   uh   yes i think so   uhm  because because if we have to speak english with the exchange students we may we may hesitate we think that th is this language barrier make us difficult to communicate   and it ' s hard for the foreign students you know because if you i mean the people are difficult you know what then  i mean you never like be yourself  you have to think of everything you gonna have to say    so uhm it it it ' s really a tough problem because sometime if they try  then sometime a local a lot local students here they don't  uh  they it ' s hard it ' s hard for them to speak to them    and then i also found that culturally there is a big difference  yes   uhm   uhm   uhm   yes   uhm  uhm    uh   sometimes we may not understand their english because there is a lot of slang etc cetera     uhm uhm  and even activities are different don't you find  uhm yes most of them participate activities outside the hall   yeah like uhm i guess because the hall you know is mostly the local   one word uhm i mean look at it this way every time there is activities mostly it ' s in chinese anyway  like the singing contest you know i mean i mean i i can follow it i i i i can't say i can hear every word  but i mean i ' m comfortable there but for the foreigners they don't understand   uhm   yes   uhm   uhm  uhm also for the halloween they they like to celebrate a lot but we won't  because we chinese don't have such a habit    uhm uhm  okay  in the halloween we we didn't celebrate a lot  because it ' s is foreign festival but for the for example the mid au autumn festival we ' ll we ' ll have a lot of celebration go to barbecue etc cetera    okay  yeah yeah  but but christmas is very happy holiday  i i always long for it    yeah  me too  uhm so i will go to shenzhen for two two days and also i will go to tsim sha tsui to watch the light have have you ever been there the tsim sha tsui beautiful light    no  i ' ve been to tsim sha tsui but i haven't seen the light  christmas decoration is same as in hong kong   i haven't seen it  where is it  is it by the hotel   uh  yes uh nearly every hotel has such decoration   really  yes you have to go out   i will i will well on the twenty third i am going to the nutcracker  ballet with my with my family   uhm   oh you like ballet   i used to dance  can you tell i have the graceful movement  oh both-laugh    no both-laugh  it is awful ten years of ballet and i don't even show  how how long you have been dancing the ballet   for ten years   wah ten years  $a-laughs    yeah can you tell  no   not at all this is awful  $a-laughs  see that ' s the worst part of ballet and not for piano and ten years of piano alright you can perform  and you can play the piano ballet i never do it  and when would i dance like that you won't and we kick the sphere by the way i move i don't even walk any better  $a-laughs   yes   yes  you can't fit in it into your everyday life i think  it ' s difficult  so so you will will you remember a few nights before you you dance ballet in the pantry and i feel very strange for that because i can't imagine that you a a ballet dancer  i really can't because  it ' s not like you    yeah yeah   yeah   oh   oh  oh i ' ll what am i like  i i think you are like a boy more than a girl both-laugh   oh no  it ' s true me too i i ' m also a boyish girl   i look a boy both-laugh  what would a boy  so have you been to the ocean park   no  you haven't   no i was i ' m not a boy  so how can both-laugh  don't be like that no that ' s okay you because you do a lot of sport every time i see you you you are sweating  $z-laughs  you ' re just having walk running already that ' s that ' s why i think that you you you are more like the you you not you are more active and also you like sport more than than other girls   you know what the funny thing is i have never been athletic  when i was a kid i did ballet  i did art clay painting  like flute i play the flute i play the flute for so many year like i have never been to sport and i guess that ' s the reason why i am interested in sport now  because i felt that i didn't do it when i was a kid  you know so hon hon   hah   uhm   uhm   uhm   yes   uhm uhm   uhm   is your own interest or your your parents force you to do do to do so   you mean sports or the other side  the other side   well it ' s more like becoming a girl i several words   you want to bond to be more like a girl to do these activities   i guess because at that time i i mean my parents are very athletic  so it ' s nature for me to to do things  like play the flute  look at the one word  very girl you think it ' s very  i mean like look like little girl dance ballet  you know   uhm   uh   i see   yes ev  every every little girl imagine that she want to like she want to play the piano like to like to dance the ballet because it ' s it ' s beautiful  just just because of that and they go and learn it    yeah  yeah it ' s funny because i never thought of ballet as beautiful i just my mum just wanted me to do stuff  you know she uhm my mum spend spends her life driving kids to all the different levels but uhm so ballet is one thing that i i did it and in the end i hate it because i dance almost everyday after school  because i was  oh i i because i i i i dance so much that it wasn't fun anymore and then i quit you know because it was just like it was so much it the demand it was so demanding  and i guess after a while i realize that wait a minute i mean i can sure i can dance ballet and i can like play music but when people ask me out to play volleyball  i can't play volleyball  when people tell me to like i don't know play softball   i can't play softball i can't even hit the ball  and i guess that ' s why i i decided because in canada i guess there is a lot of people do sports so i guess i might well i want to be good at it too and so i give it for a while i want to try thing try different things out  uh   uh it ' s a lot   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm   uhm  yes because i think that it ' s it ' s difficult for ballet uh when you are dancing ballet it ' s difficult for you to communicate with other people but if you are doing sport you can run  they you can running together and example you do the volleyball you can you can fight the team together and i think that it helps you to communicate and to make friends  and also to establish some cooperation between two of you    sure  and i guess that ' s why i really value about sports  because you can do it together and it ' s fun  you know uhm and i mean it ' s a great work out right now i ' m twenty two my metabolism goes down  $a-laughs  and everything i eat goes right here  $a-laughs and here and i can't eat a lot like i used to right and i ' m so skinny i feel it it doesn't go to the right places  $a-laughs  but i still get fat and so that ' s why  but i ' m not fat in the right place  $a-laughs  uhm but i guess i that ' s one of the reason why i do sport    because it ' s a great way for me to keep my weight down to keep my figure and also uhm stress  you know   uhm   uhm   you are not fat   uhm   uhm  i see    wai  you know i am always stress out i am always two words  it ' s it ' s to i think that it ' s too hard to study in hong kong i also i myself really don't like it because even in the university of hong kong which is expected to be quite relax and have a lot of space for you to develop yourself i don't think that i have enough space for that and and when compare with other places in the world i think that the schools in other places are much better because they have larger space for their students to develop theirselves themselves because their the stress for stu study is not not such not so tense   i don't know if you can say that you know  because when i was study at home i ' m stressed out too   uhm  it ' s true  it ' s the same    yeah  it ' s the same uhm i guess it depends on the person you know it like i ' m always stress out  i ' m stress out when i was shopping and i can't find anything  uhm   uhm  you are you are stress people   i ' m trying to control my stress but it just i don't know it ' s like sometimes i get i get hyper  i get excited and sometimes after a while it hypers like the uh  it kind of all mix together and sometimes two words stress i am just very excited   uhm  yes sure you ' re sometimes like that both-laugh    and so and so i can't find anything then i star out you know i can't find it i can't believe it i can't find it i spend four hour can't find anything right  do you stop do you go shopping a lot in hong kong because things are so cheap so   they ' re not though  you you don't think so   it depends what you buy  yes it true   you know for like designer clothes  it ' s the same price   uhm  same price for for famous brands also only  yes yes so famous brands in hong kong are are not are not especially cheap but i think that for others with no famous brand name it it ' s much cheaper than other places     yeah polo you know   yeah  but i ' m chiefly the former part  i uh where did you go shopping most   right now  uhm   where i bought some sogo   uhm  sogo   l love that store  you like department store   i guess i ' m sort of use to and it ' s relaxing  yes i i also like to go to japanese department store not but not chinese kind of have you ever been to the the chinese department store   like which one  like chungqil and also  tai wa one word such like that they they sell things produce in china and it ' s it ' s especially old fashioned  so the only thing i buy there is the is the the the clothes we have to wear to school it ' s the only thing i buy there  because it ' s it ' s too old fashioned and and some people may think that it ' s not good because you buy foreign things and help foreign economy to flourish but not our own own economy yes but some people in hong kong they deny that they are chinese people    chungqil   no   yeah   uhm   right  really  yes but but for you for example for you tina you may think that you may said that you are i am a chinese i am born i am born here in hong kong which a place which is a place in china so you are a chinese you may say so but for most hong kong people even they are born in there grow up here they will say that they are not chinese   what do they say they are  they are they admire the foreign culture and also they said they are hong kong people   they  they are hong kong people because they they think that hong kong is very different from china hong china is so so backward so underdeveloped so poor they don't they don't want to to be one of them   really  but for for something that when they get proud or glory from the from from international international meetings they will they will say that we are chinese they are al always fluctuating for humiliating things they will said that they they are hong kong people but for glory things they will say that they are chinese    it ' s like it ' s always like that    uhm  that ' s a pity that ' s a pity because in order to have a good stuff  you have to have the bad stuff right   uhm  yes   that ' s uh something that i have learnt you know uhm no none that that ' s really fortune because i guess growing up i experience that too  being in canada when there are so few chinese people    you know uhm i don't i don't feel like like you know like because someone people would put down chinese people    sound so some people would put down chinese people they would be racist   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm   so  but i think that it ' s not it ' s not as as strong as past  it ' s is better now    uhm uhm  oh yeah was just because there is more both-laugh  there is more because there is more of us there twenty of us around the world  $a-laughs we are dominate the globe  because i think that i think that chinese people is is is quite influland  flu quite influential in vancouver they have diff quite a lot of money and they do business successfully it may envy us i think sometimes    uhm uhm  yeah what ' s funny of because i found that uhm  like come in here  i i appreciate being chinese you know uhm because i ' m i know how i ' m different from the rest of these  foreign students  but yet i like them because i grew up in canada you know so it ' s kind of need how uhm this kind of like or why i like in two culture  mix it to my own do you like   uhm   uhm   yes   uhm uhm   yes   uhm uhm and you choose the best fat out of the two   yeah yeah  so you will you can be the best people   i want to be the best because i can do it both-laugh it ' s good so when you first time you you come to hong kong and do you think that the atmosphere around is too too stress toos and there is too many people around and the and the air is too polluted do you think so   oh the air is very polluted  i mean is is and and what cause is because it ' s so humid   you know even though there is a lot a lot of manufacturing uhm facilities  like factories right here where we live but because it ' s so humid that the ash from the car they don't go away  so that what we smell and i found that really tough uhm the people at first it was oh it was all the people  $a-laughs  uhm like i hate going shopping on sunday  i was shopping at times square on  sunday it was awful and i had a headache when i came home because i mean you have to wait half hour using washroom and therefore when i get there later uhm but the stress because i ' m sort of stress up person  uhm and i think work or style  i ' m very similar to most quote chinese workers  $a-laughs  you know because my mum and dad made me study  like when i was a kid which is similar to what you did  i ' m sure right  uhm yeah and there i two words i will be studying  you know where maybe for lot of uhm like westerners   yes   uhm   uhm yes   uhm   uhm   uhm   me too   me too   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   i see   uhm  yes there are  they ' re not accus accustom to our style because  because it ' s not suitable for them they are so relax in their own life own country life  i think i also always think that westerners are like people living in the village in the country and we hong kong people are like people living in the city like those japanese people in tokyo    your study when you working   yeah   yeah   yeah  yeah what ' s needed because i guess because vancouver is getting quite large   that i i don't feel hong kong is being a big big city  uh at first i found my garden as big city like europe okay but i guess i don't feel that come in hong kong i guess part of it is still quite a safe place   in that uhm even like the mavia you know they go for all the rich people  they ought to come for us some some starving student who got no money  $a-laughs  him and take all the asset and he come to buy   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   you you have more money than i do because you you have you can go to australia i can't for this holiday i have to go in the summer vacation i think   but you know what it is no no no no it ' s only no i didn't pay for this trip  see what i did was i bought it okay i could have bought a plain ticket from vancouver to hong kong   okay  that was even more money than a ticket from vancouver to australia   uh   uhm  it ' s it ' s you     because it ' s peak season for hong kong travel  uh   so it ' s cheaper for me to go to australia so i use hong kong as my stop over point  oh i see   i even if i don't go to australia i already save  yeah i already save money   so it ' s like a free trip  oh it ' s it ' s too good   see  oh because i i like australia because i i myself like things like places that are that are like countryside with a lot of of green views around because i maybe i live in the city for such a long time i like re remote places most most of the time so that ' s why i don't like go to go to tokyo vancouver etc cetera   i like to go to china china and also for example thailand philippines i ' ve i have been for many times there for this  summer vacation i but i i don't feel boring because i like to swim in the under the sunlight and also to to sleep on the beach i i alrea just just for that i feel very comfortable and i don't admire other activities such as shopping etcetera    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   yeah  really  yes   you ' re you ' re definitely not a hong kong girl  $z-laughs  i i don't like hong kong girl i i think i i ' m more like chinese girl   yeah  yes so whe where are you going to work when you graduate have you think of this question   i i i think of it all the time  uhm i don't know where what i want to do yet like i guess myself because i am a business three  i guess myself working for a financial company  uh like helping uh businesses raise money  for example china wants to build a dam  i will be one of the charge of raising money or uh management consulting  uhm or last score  or being a diplomat for a foreign service   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   wah   uhm   uhm   uhm  oh it ' s so good  i admire this work    so  do you  so so you you expect you several words  both-laugh and work around the world    earn a lot money   yeah   like your father do   yeah i i want to work around the world and i want to change the world  i want to make it a better place  because even though i don't have a lot of money even though i don't have everything i still think i ' m a lot better than a lot of other people like uh look at it this way because i was born in canada  i was able to have the life now i was able to go to school  i was able to have health care  i don't have to pay for health care i was able to go to school and  if i were live if i lived in the us i don't think i could just go to school i would have to work too because it ' s so expensive there   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yes   uhm  it ' s it ' s much more expensive to study in the usa than in vancouver   yeah because the tuition is very expensive  uhm yes i think that usa is the most expensive place than others   yeah and if i lived in hong kong  i wouldn't have my own big room not that i have a big room but i mean i i i have a room uhm i have and i have my my desk in a different room  so i luckily  i can have i can have a stereo in my study room and then i have my bedroom and i decorate my bedroom the way i want it  i paint it uhm if i live in hong kong i won't be able to do that   uhm   yes   uhm  yes i think that you have the the best things out of us
