 yeah 
 
 hah muhn these cantonese words refer to
xiamen which is a province in china and uh fuzhou 
 fuzhou 
 uhm 
 
uh there is some kind of mountain resort area 
forget the name 
 yeah 
is it ex expensive
 
i hope not 
oh you want 
 you also
this time you also go there by train
 
uh take it to fujian is more convenient by bus the
 the the train are
because like uhm xiamen it ' s kind of an island 
it ' s on the train take a long long time from from shenzhen
the bus to xiamen take nine hours
 yeah they have many buses to fujian from shenzhen
but not any other provinces yeah
and then uh and then i ' m going to jiangxi province which is
next to to fujian and then eventually come back
and that way i ' ll take the train 
 uh 
 uhm 
 oh 
but do do you think it ' s uh do you feel comfo 
uh comfortable for for the for the environment
cause it ' s it ' s quite dirty 
 
 yeah 
 you find the one-words 
in china and hygiene problem
 and 
 
yeah 
 laughs 
there there are benefit
there are also i think uh 
 you it ' s very oh very good
hotel is it uh two words 
 it ' s a training 
 
no i live in very cheap hotel 
 laughs 
i live in one that they try to get me to have prostitute uh 
 laughs 
i i ' m not willing to pay any more than a hundred and fifty
renminbi at the very most
usually i will stay at places that are maybe sixty renminbi or or
 eighty 
so a lot of them don't really have a bathroom even 
 laughs 
 oh 
uh ha
but is it okay 
 
 but they not not really hotel 
 laughs 
and it just well all ladies on the street that they ask for
about a room 
it ' s a strange uh uh 
 
 it ' s uh strange right yeah 
 uh oh or i i think you better carry a bot
 a a few bottles of water
 
yeah i alway do yeah 
yeah
 
and the bathroom are terrible but i i tell you i try to pretend i
i know all speakers laugh 
yeah
you you always uh uh go around uh the united states also
 
no in american i ' m very lazy
in american i ' m like a hong kong person
 hong kong people never go anywhere but 
maybe shenzhen 
 but in american i don't go anywhere
 
 uhm 
 uh 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uh 
 but american is is much larger than hong kong
 uh 
i think if i ' m uh american i i should i should be uh not
so not to be so lazy
 i would i like to walk around yeah
 
 yeah 
 uh 
i i go around my city it it very expensive to travel
because there there there are mostly are not trains
and you either have to drive which takes a long time or you fly
yeah so it it ' s more expensive
in china the train are so good and the buses are good so 
 it ' s 
 uh ha 
the the bus is good but i think the people are not uhm bit
 
 or the the the the bit 
it it it you survive the bus is quite good 
 and
 laugh 
they they drive they drive 
 two-words the two thing
dangerous
they don't follow any transportation rules
 
no but
there are no such things as law that has to be follow in
china
there ' s there ' s way there ' s interpreting any given law
regulation
so they from what i understand in china
you are much more likely to get a parking ticket than to get a
speeding ticket
as as long as you moving they don't really care
so yes it ' s a bit dangers and it ' s it ' s amazing that there
will be a blind turn where you can't see lot ' s in front of you
and they ' ll go around two or three car as the uh trackers or
whatever
you just have to 
 laughs 
yeah yeah
 
hold your heart and then and hope that that you will survive and
i ' ve never had a problem but i see on the news lots of people
 going off bus 
 yeah one-word 
you just be careful when the when the car was is falling then
you you prepare to jump out
 
not 
 laughs 
out of the
yeah i remember i i went to uh guangzhou with with
him uh last year for for for pro 
project 
 and
 laugh 
it ' s uh it ' s crazy i think i think so
we uh actually after the after the trip i i ' m a bit uh 
feel
i i feel a little bit terrible 
 laughs 
yeah i ' m afraid of uh going back to china actually
 a little bit
because uh the the how to say
the the tut the air 
 
 oh 
 oh 
 project 
 no 
 
 the air is polluted 
yeah polluted 
 
 oh yeah that ' s right 
 three words 
hong kong is also polluted
but it ' s much much worse but 
 
 here is okay and uh in in in tsim sha
tsui and other that worse
yeah i i have problem with the air in china too 
 yeah 
do you
 
i uh
like on a train everybody is smoking and that that ' s 
really difficult i mean
when i studied in shanghai i i i i coughed everyday 
 yeah and and then so my friends recommended that
i go to qingdao and and dailian
and they said those are the two clean cities in china 
and they are they are very wonderful
they are very very clean and there ' re people
sweeping the street all day
 and uh they don't they don't let
it like shenzhen they don't let many people live there 
and they keep others out
so it ' s it it very nice and they ' re on the waters so 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm yeah 
 uh 
 yeah 
 uh 
uh perhaps it ' s the there are the on the only two 
 cities 
 
 yeah yeah 
that ' s the my friends said the only two 
 and
 laugh 
 two-words the clean cities
and yeah i think uh do you think hong kong is is acceptable
i i think it uh 
 
 oh yeah yeah compare with 
comparing with other with guangzhou it much better i
think so 
 
 yeah it ' s what what what amaze me in in in
china is that a a person running a store will throw trash right on the street
in front of their own store 
 yeah you you you watch you watch 
 
 yeah i mean you you see them throwing garbage out
of the street but it ' s right in front of their store
 so i mean they who ' s going to walk in the
shop there
i mean they don't even care about how their own store like so 
yeah it it ' s
there ' s a big problem with the trash 
 yeah 
 yeah it it was terrible yeah
i i remember this a a a few months ago there ' s uhm
an a head a heading in a newspaper you remember
there ' s a uhm baby girl uh die uhm but just uh
left at the corner the street corner
 
 oh 
oh 
oh goddess uhm
 
 i didn't hear about that 
 yeah 
this is so terrible because uh it ' s uh it ' s uh due
to the the the the born 
 
 no one child 
yeah the policy
 oh 
uhm
so it ' s terrible like the
it just throw uh the baby leg hid as a a rub 
rubbish
 
oh uhm uhm
yeah i read in a newspaper the uhm china did a big census you
know where they count the people just like hong kong is doing
 and they they said in the last ten years for
every one hundred girl that were born in china a hundred and seventeen boys
were born 
 yeah 
yeah
yeah
 
so in fact there will be there will be a lot of crime in the
future when all these men want wives all speakers laugh they need
 several words 
you know there is already lots of selling of women and and
kidnapping 
yeah it ' s terror
we better talk about those happy things
 
yeah 
yeah okay
okay
 
okay happy things 
 one-word

 i still have about ten minutes 
about ten minutes is okay yeah

song dynasty kaifeng and then another old city luoyang uh
we ' re we ' re going we ' re going there because no tourists go
there
 and that week it will be very busy because so many
people of vacations
so if we went to a popular spot then it it will be too difficult
to get hotel uh uh train tickets 
 yeah 
yeah so so after the semester is better right
cause not not so many people have the have the leisure
time to
 
yeah 
yeah yes you have
so you you will you will back to shanghai also
 
uhm probably the visit yeah 
yeah you you live in shanghai
 
i i i studied there for a semester 
semester you you that means you have that ' s this is is
your second one-word 
 
 uhm right 
this this is my second semester abroad yeah but the shanghai
one i didn't do this year
i did it two years ago so in nineteen ninety nine
so
i i don't like my my american university very much so i i
go there for two semester
then i study abroad third semester then go
back go to 
 oh 
 several words 
university
 
yeah but it ' s in a very terrible city all speakers laugh
 
 oh 
 you don't like the city
 
it would be like going uh to school in uh maybe wuhan or
or shenyang 
 laughs 
why why why why do you say the city is 
 
 it ' s uh the economy ' s been very bad for
many years
it it ' s an industrial city but but but the
industry left long ago 
 and
 laugh 
it ' s moved elsewhere so there ' s a lot of very
poor people a lot of crime you have to 
people are just very unhappy there ' s a lot of race problems 
 uh uh 
 oh industrial 
 oh 
 oh 
 uhm 
 then will you will you uh go to
 one- word yeah yeah
 go to other city 
 
yeah well the second the minute i graduate i ' m leaving 
 what the minute 
 yeah 
 
 yeah i i told my father my the only the present
i want is there have a plane ticket for maybe shanghai or or hong kong in my
hand when i received the diploma
and then just walk right out 
 laughs get on the plane and then 
 uh you bring your luggage to to uh get
 your grad graduate 
 
 yeah and my father hates the city too
because he ' s from new york and then philadelphia near by 
and uh near he don't like philadelphia
so he said he would meet me in shanghai and he will watch my
graduation on the internet
because they broadcast there
i ' m hear that he doesn't want to come again 
 and
 laugh 
 yeah yeah 
we don't have uh graduation broadcast there we don't have
 i don't know
no maybe
no one will watch it actually
no need to have broadcasting
 
i i i think they also do it because there ' s only so many seat
 available where they have the ceremony
so if if if if you are so you limited the number of relative you
can buy 
so if if if you bring more relatives or friend they can go to
different auditorium and watch it on tv yeah or on the internet
but you only get a certain number of tickets to the actual
ceremony 
it seems that you you you hate your your school right 
 laughs 
 
i don't know about that but i i enjoy my time elsewhere 
 laughs 
 elsewhere 
 you always
 
it it ' s a good education but it ' s uh i don't enjoy my life
there so much 
 laughs 
you always take a uh participate an exchange program
uh ha will 
 
 yeah
well i still spending three years there that ' s enough
 for 
 do you have to extend your study in 
 one- word school
 no 
 
 uhm no 
 no 
i ' ve been very careful
 i take lots of extra classes
here i ' m very lazy i have have a very light schedule
 but i take many extra one in american so i don't
have any problems
i get my credit transfer too 
 oh 
 yeah 
uh okay so you no need to extend anymore yeah 
 
 no i i wouldn't be able to do it
it will be too expensive 
 laughs uhm 
so you still have one only one year to go
 
yeah yeah 
so so so
keep talking 
 one-word i ' m a 
two-words 
 
i i actually getting two degree a a a
business degree and then a and then a
 one-word bachelor of arts in chinese 
 uh 
 i know 
 when will 
bachelor of arts
 
yeah
a ba it ' s a bsba yeah 
 yeah it ' s so it ' s what ' s it about when it 
 so it ' s about 
 uhm 
 
 so a business school the bs in
economics
and then i ' m also a student in their their liberal arts college
the the the school of arts and science
and so i ' ll get a a a bachelor ' s degree in chinese from them so
two separate degrees so i have to take lots of extra classes 
 because 
i have to meet both school graduation requirements 
 one-word 
 uh 
oh oh i don't think this will the the case
will happen in hong kong 
 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah i don't think you are allowed to do
that 
uh my school they ' re pretty flexible
you can do double majors like double major will be two majors in
the same school
 but because mine is one is in the business school
one is in the the liberal art school
that is call the dual degree 
 yeah 
 uhm 
oh dual degree
 
that ' s fairly common in america
everybody wants to have two majors three majors two minors
that and they may make it sound betters 
 laughs 
yeah it sound one-word 
uh why why don't you take an uh uhm uh computer minor or
something like that one-word 
 
i i would like to because it ' ll be very useful but the courses
are very hard at my school
i i was just i ' m just singing up for courses for next fall
right now
we can do it online and uhm
i was writing to professors teachers that the business computer
programming course which that the prerequisite for like
the database course that that you two are taking right now
and i read through the syllabus and i wrote to professor
and i said the only program i enrolled i i i try to do a little
visual basic ones in in a course with other stuff and i did
terribly
and he wrote back and he said if you if you had trouble of visual
basic you will really really in capital letters struggle with this
course 
 laughs 
and everybody i talked they said the work is so heavy that you
really need to know a lot of programming before you take it
 and uh so it ' s just been too much work 
 uh 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uh 
 yeah 
 the programming course only teach uh vb
 
uhm uh c plus plus 
 oh 
 c plus plus
you know c already
 
no
i don't know any of it 
 laughs 
it ' s okay
that ' s okay it ' s one-word 
 
 but it it 
i ' ll i ' ll probably sit in on the course at the beginning of the
semester but i think it would be too much work
and i i i have too many other classes to take this this
this fall
like for my chinese major i have to write a thesis with the class
and
there there is another course i think in one course on operations
of information management that that ' s the name for the
department of my school like mis
 and i ' ll probably take another course which is a
more general one yeah 
 oh yeah 
 yeah 
 so i suggest you to buy more textbooks
here to back to us 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 
 yeah i have
i ' m working on this yeah 
 or you may choose to buy textbooks in
china
they are even cheaper 
 eng english 
 two-words 
 yeah 
 
 uh 
 but but the but the 
 but the character is so small and 
yeah
 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 
but the books here are the same as i have in america but so much
cheaper and 
 uhm 
yeah
 
i can't
so jealous uh
i saw hong kong student from my university here in january buying
books to take back yeah
yeah like my uhm cost accounting book you all took cost
accounting right 
 yeah 
 no 
 no 
 
oh you don't 
only professional account students do
 
oh i see
everybody in my has to to 
yeah and and that book in america was ninety us dollar 
 to 
ninety
 
and here is about twenty seven it and it is
the same book
it doesn't even say international edition 
 also it ' s uh 
 oh 
so it ' s uh big business opportunity to buy books 
 laughs 
 yeah 
 
so the problem is carrying them all speakers laugh 
and if they change the edition then it ' s useless 
 and
 laugh 
but i wish i knew about this beforehand 
yeah so uh
so is it the time the time is near right
 
yeah 
 so uh i think that okay for for
the conversation yeah
 
 yeah times yeah times up okay 
 for okay 
or uh go to the theatre
just like that or uhm watching tv uh mr bean
something like that 
 
 uhm 
 uh huh uh huh 
and then they will feel very happy
and then uh for example uh phone their friends
aw for example my land-mate always phoned uh her friends
in the weekend to london to bath yeah
 
oh what what about you shirley
did you think it was a tut an interesting culture to
live in 
well does not uh does not much difference not 
the big difference because uhm may be my host family is just a little bit
traditional so more or less does the same as the chinese
 
 uhm 
oh yeah 
yes
so i didn't find anything that ' s very different
 
what did you find most different 
most different
 
yeah 
uhm
 
say about your family 
the family
 
yeah the most 
well not much
 
no
nothing strike 
 just may be one thing is that uhm we can
talk in a more friendly way
 
why why do you think that in what why is it that you can go all
the way from hong kong to england and talk in a more friendly way 
than you can with your parents in hong kong
was it very strange 
 uhm 
 right
 
toto why is that
what ' s what ' s your opinion 
it ' s a tradition
 
what what kind of 
 chinese 
yes the culture 
 it ' s more 
yes
the chinese culture think that parents and their
children are of a superior and inferior position yes
 so 
 culture 
 
 yeah 
 does it 
they ' re
may be uhm 
 they ' re they ' re they are uhm not good
listener
 
okay but then how do you even think about speaking to other
adults to a new culture or country because you are product of that as well so
most young chinese people two-words no 
i think so but may be
no
uhm but may be i ' m a little bit different and
 
just a little bit 
too talkative and too funny and too interest
 
 uh huh 
uh huh 
i found it ' s difficult to talk with my parents and than with
my landlady
 
uhm
but did you talk about 
 uhm 
excuse me
 
yup 
i think uh that one-word i think because
uhm we always think that uhm parents know us a lot
 
uhm uhm 
and then we lived together but uhm for example our 
land-mate or host family their stranger and so we we ha and
different cultures so we will talk much
 
 uhm uhm 
no
 
yeah but did you ever did you can i ask you did you tell your
landladies or your host families did you tell them close things about you may
be about your boyfriends or whatever 
yes
 
things that you wouldn't tell your parents 
 yeah
 
yeah 
no
 
no
toto yes
shirley yes 
 yes 
 
yeah no 
 how then how can you want more 
 
yeah 
funny thing uhm my landlady uhm one day my landlady uhm
phoned my her be phoned her best friends phone her
friend sorry and her friend said asked my landlady uh about me
 
uhm uhm 
and then i heard my landlady said uhm stephanie is quite
because she hasn't got a boyfriend
aw
 
you are quite because you haven't got a boyfriend
 quiet 
yeah
 
yeah
that ' s is strange 
 but i don't know
 does it 
 
 yeah uh
you don't seem quiet
you ' re the one you ' re the one who are doing all the speaking
yeah
 
yeah
okay what was the course like 
boring
 
was it boring when when you actually in the 
yes yes yes
 
in the college
