<I>
welcome to this presentation
uh here today i will give you a brief introduction on the products
on the company profile uh jardine information system and hong kong informix
uh are you ready ok
uh today you know uh we have a few products from the hong kong
informix is the informix sql informix uh fourgl and many other tools
front-end tools back-end tools and many other kinds of products 
uh first of all i ' ll give you an introduction on the company
profile 
uh jardine information system
jardine information system is the a division under jardine office
system uh
the main target of the the main goal of the jardine information
system is to uh as a is a as a distributor to give you uh a service back-up
and set you a products informix 
informix is a database product is ah is give you a th ah 
solution for you to dissolve the problems in relational database
uh relational database as you may know then is uh is a
kind of uh data information management concept
uh it helps you to uh develop your application base on some rules
of relational database
actually this development is a set of tables
a table is a kind of a for example is a kind of files are contains
of a set of records
this records contains of uh another set of fields and then
information are uh would gather in this kind of uh this kind of format 
hong kong informix
hong kong informix is uh your you mainly give us our
technical support and informations uh information brochure or some kinds of
service support 
then the main uh t the main support is given by us by
jardine information system
we ' ll give you uh a service backup or maintenance or training or
any kinds of technical support 
now uh we will go back to the sys uh to the product
profile 
informix 
there is two kinds two kinds of products in informix product family
the first one is the front-end tools
the front-end tools is the for example is uh informix sql informix
fourgl 
uh front-end just means uh the application tools the software
products that will interact direct directly with the user with the
end user
uh they will not handle they will not handle the real physical 
reaphys real and physical uh data match 
and the an another kinds of product is the back-end tools
the back-end tools works is the it is the tools to directly access
the database access the hardware the hard disk and the communication between
between the two one-word is very important
uh because uh as we have some kinds of operation from the end user
 uh we will have to we have to uhm make uh a a uh connection
between the front-end tools and the back-end tools 
the uh as we make the operations valid and then i will send you a
message send a call to the uh to the back-end tools and the and the back-end
tools is the database engine
the database engine will process the data uh directly with your
hard disk make some uh transactions and then we ' ll make the result back to
the front-end tools and user can in this kind of format they can uh access
the data in the remote site 
this kind of uh operation we can uh we can ss uh s called
a client server model or uh or s or two process architecture 
front-end tools 
actually we have a several kinds of front en front-end
tools
the first one is s isql we call it uh informix sql
uh informix s sql stands for you know uh some 
somebody may know is the uh structural query language
uh it ' s a language de uh derive from the ansi uh ansi
standard
ansi standard stands for a n s i american national uh standards
institute
it gives you a standard in the relational database and we give the
uh we and we can uh use this uh this kind of standard and develop our
standard we call it informix sql 
informix sql is actually a front-end tools
the se second one is the uh the informix fourgl 
informix fourgl is the another product that is the program and
environment for you to develop your program with fourgl 
fourgl means uh stands for fourth generation language 
fourth generation language is the is the new language a new
generation language different from the third generation
the third genera third generation languages > ? > were
known as c or pascal it ' s a kind of language
it gives you uh many flexibility on various purpose
various purpose uh for you to develop to uh your own application
but for the fourth generation language is mainly its main goal
is to develop your application of uh database 
it deal much uh much work in database but not other kinds of uh of
applications and that is the fourth generation language 
and the and there ' s another front-end users the esql 
esql is the embedded sql with c is that that means that you can
you can write uh computer language uh with sql and third languag 
third generation language c together
and two languages can be combined into a single language and
then we call it esqlc
it giv it gives you a great flexibility in programming
and generally we can have this kind of uh front-end tools 
the back-end tools
the back-end tools is uh divided into two processes 
uh back-end tools uh is actually is actually uh is a either a 
data online database engine or standard engine 
standard engine will give you a uh give you a easy of use uh
product
actually it will gives you an little management uh database engine
because for the standard engine you you need not uh care about much uh much
thing that are so certif certificate or uh most of the complicated
work are eliminated
uh but for the online engine you you need to uh you need to
tackle with many technical problems because uh it will contain many uh
operation system concept
for example uh you you have to manage a hard disk with the online
engine 
uh you have to manage your memory and other tools in the in the
in the operating system or hardware and this kind of one-word
 will be handled in the online engine but not in the standard
engine
standard engine will not handle this kind of operations 
but how about the uh how about a a how about the standard
engine and if if it cannot handle this kind of uh operating system or it
cannot adapt to only uh uh platform configuration uh because the online
engine the online engine is the is the engine which will give you a
uh all availability one-word 
that means the you the the availa the high availability
will give you for example uh seven seven days in the week and twenty-four
hours a day uh service
then the online engine will not be down will not will n n 
will not down uh in any aspect even though even though the hard disk is
crashed or the power is down and the online engine can can have a
recovery process such that even the hardware uh has some uh any difficulties
to operation and or or or there ' s any the power power insufficiency and then
the online engine can handle this kind of problems uh that so that the data
in the database in the 1-word engine will not be
corrupted
but for the standard engine there will have little little uh
little tools for you to uh handle this kind of problem is for example the
power down or the disk crash 
this ' s the difference between the online engine and the standard
engine
now uh in the following sections i will give you a more details in
this kind of products and how they interact with each other 
first of all is informix sql
informix sql is actually uh is actually a uh user environment for
you to developing your full your full applications in database 
in the informix sql there are five built-in tools
the first one is form form writer form writer 
the second is report writer 
and then it ' s interactive t s sql editor interactive
sql editor 
and finally there is a interactive schema editor schema editor
and okay form writer
form writer is actually is uh is just for you to build your scheme
form
the scheme form actually is a is a is a format for you to uh manage
your database on the screen on the on the screen tha u that will
give you for example wil uh uh we will use the term what you see is
what you get that means uh whatever you write in the form classifications
there will be uh the same exact format you will see on the screen
 that ' s the form form writer
the form writer will give you uh the tools for you to uh wr
 write your form the screen form in a form specifications
a form specifica specifications specify which
kind of operations can uh will be valid in the in the form field in the
form field
there are there are the four operations uh in the form writer
the first one is uh query 
update delete add this kind of operation is uh are
usually used in uh in usual in usual operations in the database is to add a
record delete a record or carry a find a record from the database
this kind of operations are are the most most likely used in the
database operations and then you ' ll give the the form writer will give this
kind of operations valid for you to operate on the database 
the second one is report writer
report writer tool gives you a uh great flexibility in writing a
report
the report can be for example a name list or label or some
kinds of format some kind of format that will give you a column table format
report 
the report writer uh is the uh is very like that with the
form form writer because the report writer can uh can give you a uh also a
 use the report writer will use uh also uh a for a report
specification
after you specify your report specifications you the report writer
can generate automatically uh the report the report uh format that you want
uh sometimes the report may involve a calculation for example uh
after you write a report you there will a subtotal or or some average and
some some fields or some columns and then the report writer will
automatically generate this kind of calculation no matter no matter uh uh
what kind of data is uh uh inside the database
because sometimes the database will change from the time to time
and then the report writer need not to regenerate need not to be regenerated
and the order report to you can be valid even you have changed the database
content and the report writer will generate a report format such that the
report format can be used uh even your data can uh have been changed and that ' s
the flexibility of the report writer 
the first one in the third one is the interactive interactive sql
editor
actually you can write some sql statements
sql statements is the format defined in the ansi standard ansi
standard sql 
and the interactive sql states sql ss editor will
 a allow you to uh write some sql statements and run the sql
statements because uh after you write the sql statements the machine will not
know what you want what you want that what you want to do and then the editor
will help you to run the sql statement
for example there are several uh sql statements we will usually use
the first one is select select statement
select statement is the kind of operation we want to uh for example
 if you want to uh get some information from the database for example
i want to select the customer number customer name customer address from
the database table customer from the customer table and then the 
one-word after you run the operation uh the scheme will give you
the results and the database will give you uh the full set of uh information
you specify company name company uh the customer name customer number in the
format in the format you specify
but there ' s difference between the report writer and this kind of
select statement because uh the select statement will not format will not
format your your output
it just gives you the output gives you the output
only will not format wil uh the output but for the uh report writer
it ' ll give you the format
for example you want the customer na 
name uh positioned at the the at the th some specific place or you
want your address uh display in some format
and then the report writer will help you to do this kind of
formatting but for the select statement it will give it ' ll giv give
you information only and t no formatting uh will be derived
and there are many other kinds of sql statement for example is
insert or delete uh this kind of operation will help you to insert
uh a record to the database table or delete it from the database table
this kind of operation will be will be will be used oftenly in the
sql editor
and there are many other kinds of tools that that are not defined
in the in the ansi system sql and then it will it will also uh u it
you can also use this kind of uh sql statement uh
we we had better call it uh utility
actually it ' s not a s sql statement
this kind of utility uh this is a utility unique to uh informix
and uh other kinds of uh s uh database software will not
contain this kind of uh operations for example is load and unload l o a d
it will you can load the data from the t the
external date external file for example is sq file or some kind of
uh external format and you can use this kind of utilities to uh load your
data and and and of course uh there are many other kinds of uh utilities 
 these are the functions of the informix uh informix
 1-word 
and the fourth one is the the interactive schema editor 
informix schema editor is actually is actually uh an
editor for you to design your database structures design your uh table
structure table definitions because in this table it is a kind of uh
information for example i have uh customer data customer table for
example i have a customer table
a customer table will contain the information uh customer
number customer name customer address customer telephone number 
and you can uh spec you must specify each group
one by one with exact data type 
for example you must specify your your customer number as as a
character type your customer name as character type uh address as
character type of ten character or telephone number as uh an integer and
then you have to specify which kin which kind of data uh for each
field it will be
and you have to define this kind of uh table definitions 
uh this kind of definitions uh can be written can be written in
sql statement as well as you can uh define this kind of definitions with
the interactive sql schema editor
the schema editor will help you to define this kind of table
definitions uh in the format uh you just fill in the blanks just 
fill in the blanks uh one by one and then you will see the table
structure defined 
that ' s the flexi that ' s the convenience for you to uh
 de uh develop your application
