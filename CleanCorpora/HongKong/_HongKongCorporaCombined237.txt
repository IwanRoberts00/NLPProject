luck  risk this is risk right known or unknown like uh if interest rate is going to go down it affects your bank account interest rate is going to go up it affects your bank account  uhm somebody in china say something it affects the stock market  it affect people ' s pocket  uhm it also affects the uhm people ' s uhm investment in their flats prices of flats goes up and down  risk uh cannot be foreseen okay some of them you can calculate it okay if i have this much customer based on past history you can calculate your risk if i have uhm one thousand customer last year okay when i make my plan this year if i put in this much of advertisement i think i ' ll be able to have one thousand or more this has been calculated but whether it ' s correct or not look back with hindsight  you know but there are some thing we cannot calculate somebody say something okay or there is an uhm if one is building make uhm building a building i mean if a workman fell fell and died probably it will affect the sale of that building these unforeseen okay risk  having say all that uhm and now we can start talking about nuskin  you remember all these shall i rub it or keep it on the board i ' ll keep it on the board i ' ll try to make use of the rest alright  so this rest of the time i ' ll spend is exploring what is a nuskin business opportunity and is nuskin business opportunity fit into all this right let ' s when we look at a business in general terms here what are the what is the item that bring in revenue cos the reason why we do business is what we do something we bring in some revenue we are talking about accounting terms or bring in some money right so among all the item here    the products  the products  do a lot of thing but eventually that ' s the movement of product that brings in revenue or bring in money so i ' ll spend some time uh talk about the nuskin product  nuskin products as you see on uhm this table has some of it if you want to see the whole range like uh kingsley ' s chocolate drink it ' s outside in in the uh in the boar in the cup  in the cupboard outside the cupboard one side is uhm idn interior design nutritionals and on the other side is personal care  so nuskin have at the moment have two division personal care division and interior design nutritional division that is the division at the moment in hong kong we have uhm i would say about quite a high percentage of the products that are available in the states maybe uhm say ninety-three percent  almost several words  almost uh uhm  eighty 1 word  eighty percent   eighty to eighty-five  eighty to eighty-five percent and there are some product that are uh waiting uhm shi  shipment to come to hong kong yeah you are correct there are something in canada that we 2 words  alright uhm next year say uhm in terms of product next year we are going to expand into new line we are going to have uhm colours for ladies lipstick eye shadow this i think that uhm i walk around wit uhm with the  prod lipsticks and not using i feel bad and i make noise so eventually they hear my voice and uhm we uhm as uhm our business expands uhm nuskin distribution expands the company begin to think that we all need some tools to help us so next year we ' re going to have some friendly computers so that ' s the plan for next year but this evening i ' m going to talk in general about personal care and idn divison  whatever product nuskin is marketing okay there is one mortal guideline or principle behind it  and it is what is it francis all    all of the good none of the bad   all of the good and none of the bad  that means all the ingredient it they are used are good for the body cos it ' s the product enhancing our appearance and also improving our health okay idn interior design nutritionals when people hear interior design some people think oh what ' s it got to do with furnitures right but in fact when you come to think of it uh closely it ' s redesigning the inside of our body right internally it redesigning so if we have good health it reflects on our physique and also reflect on our face  plus if we have good personal care products from head from head to the toe cos i ' m using all nuskin products then we ' ll have one complete person that is healthy as well as having good appearance uhm i would say beauty but beauty is in the eye of the beholder  when i look at the mirror every day i just find that the person in the mirror is changing every day  you know what is it changing it ' s getting younger and younger every day by look and is getting wiser and wiser every day by experience but i ' m not saying now that i ' m getting older and older every day no  so what is 2 words  it ' s because ingredients are all of the good none of the bad that is for the purpose it is uhm made but you say okay all of the good none of the bad  show me something so i uhm i ' m going to do a a little uh some little test just to uhm show uhm about other a little test on the personal care side 'cos with the idn product it ' s kind of difficult to show that from fat shom - sound of magical effect you become thin but if people that knew me before uh perhaps in their memory they may remember that i was much plumper and now i ' ve slimmed down right but i test we concentrate on personal care  first the first test i want to uh use is sometimes do you feel do you notice that your face would be dry when you are on an airplane or in the summer or in an office the air-con make your face dry  right so what do you do when your face is dry you go and have a wash  right or when you feel sleepy what do you do  go and wash your face so that you wake up so i have a mirror here a mirror here  i also have a bit of water here  two side of a mirror one with uhm pattern one without so choose one side  black side okay that i ' m going to sprinkle some water onto it  okay sprinkle some water with the other side the one with a pattern i ' m going to spray some napcn moisture mist we ' ll see what happen okay  so i shall put it over to here and let ' s examine it later  next test i ' m going to do is when we later go home arrive home if you ' re tired before we jump into bed i usually i don't know about all of you i usually would have a shower say supposing you do the same you have a shower maybe in the morning or in the evening whatever time it is what would you use to cleanse yourself   soap    a soap okay  nuskin also have products that we use to wash ourselves  but our products are make very near to the texture all the skin can accept so i have to do a bit of a theory here ph value  zero seven several words look like a ruler it is called a ph scale  this is acidic this is alkaline alka line correct spelling and this is neutral  what does that mean  supposing i say water is neutral i guess it begin to make some sense  what did i say just now when we go home we shower so we shower we have our 1 word we have a shower okay and then the shower go on to what our skin  so what is the ph value of our skin  rhonda you know no serena  is our skin alkaline or s acidic    acidic  acidic alright because our our sweat taste a bit salty alright but yes you are quite right our skin is slightly acidic and the ph value is four point five to six  so that ' s prove that  i have here some test paper some litmus paper it shows here five point five six seven eight and nine okay so it ' s within this range okay  i have here some products and other company ' s products as  well as is uhm our testing but uh this we just doing a comparison there ' s no uh we ' re not intending to tell to say that they are not good  2 words all by people ' s choice okay people are free to make their own choice  let me have a borrow a hand please right i dip this paper into the water and 2 words water 1 word colour and i put it on your hand okay  another hand from a man thank you kingsley  you ' ll still have your hand uh tonight  don't worry    it won't disappear    no no no no no you can have my word okay  then i dip this into the water and i put it on the nuskin body bar  same thing i do dip into the water and i put into this  pink soup okay pink soap soap not soup i have problem of pronunciation  i have a story about soup and soap when we have time i tell you about it  and i dip some water and put this into this uhm nice looking expensive soap  so i need  uh serena can you help me  stand and hold this in your hand right  and hold this in your other hand alright okay so now let ' s look at the result  this is five point five this is very near okay this is very near but it ' s too 1 word  very alkaline this is also very alkaline okay let ' s look at the scale you are about six and you are about five point five   is that good  both of you are very normal uh cos it ' s four point five to six   normal  normal normal the test is you ' re normal and you can keep your hand isn't that nice  right so if you were to choose something to wash yourself with  would you choose something that is near to your own body ' s ph value  or would you choose something that is way way different   several words    what ' s may i ask a question why would it be important  well that is a very good question why would it be important because if you choose something that will be near to your skin ' s ph value then your skin will have maintained its own natural protection film if you choose something that is very very alkaline what happen is it will wash away the skin ' s natural protection film  try to now winter is coming try to recall in the past winter when you wash yourself with soap very soon after you cleanse yourself what happen your skin get dry right  and then what do you do begin to scratch right for me i have to put on a lot of cream right a lot of cream to stop what to stop it from drying and i thought well i didn't use to know why and i change various soap  when we use water to wash ourselves would it automatically change to its skin ' s natural uh protection  the answer is yes several words  the answer is yes but how long  according to my information it will change back automatically but it take ten to twelve hours  how many times you wash your face a day i guess will be at least two right so at least two is supposing you wash seven in the morning  eleven at night or ten at night so this is more than twelve hours yeah you will get back originally but you ' re on the street it ' s dirty  but in at night after you wash it it ' s clean your home supposed to be much cleaner but that is less than twelve hours right if this area 2 words on twelve hours what if you use product that are in this area like this product that would take even longer so your skin will get drier  right and when you have dry skin you sca scratch right and you when you put on products that are not good that are not ideal for moisturising it will make it will open your pores it will make your skin even drier okay uhm if you have any further question regarding that we can answer that later but i want to show people that the the rhonda ' s hand just now it was about six it was about six now it ' s near to this colour so that means your skin after putting this on the colour will slightly change as well cos after we put this on what do we do we spray and then we tow towel ourselves dry several words  right okay    will they get a mark  will they get a mark alright  i ' ll give you a rub later  rhonda can give me a hand    she ' s got a mark on her hand  okay so so you ' ll help me rub her hand  in japan uhm there ' s a story i hear i hear i i heard about  uhm body bath yes our product body bath in japan we have a real life story there is this uhm gentleman or uhm sounds very english but this gentleman or this is chinese man who live in japan for many years so after he saw this uhm product demonstration he  let me just try one more time using this he called soap to wash myself so he bought one piece that evening after the uhm seminar he went home wash  why is it let me just try one more time because for six years  he didn't wash himself with soap  he washed himself only with water because as soon as he put soap onto himself he s scratch  he scratch because it start so itchy he scratch until blood all come out okay so that evening he went back he washed himself with this he said that let me just try one more time  after that he sit down and wait half an hour you know what happen nothing happen  two hours later you know what happen nothing happen  then he went to bed  the next morning he wakes up you know what happen  nothing happen  he didn't scratch  so you know what he did  hey that ' s the wife sleeping next to him  i can wash myself from now on with this product i think this uh even if a small piece of soap or  we call it body bath is in this good quality i think maybe we should try the rest of the product so he brought  his wife had been using lancome for a long time so they switch so they now become uh an executive and they are very  diligent so i heard lately okay sh and they are in the group of uhm in a friendly group in a of 2 words in another friendly group so that ' s the story of body bath and ph value
