<I>
 
good morning
my name is jonathan fenby
i ' m editor of the south china morning post and sunday morning post
and i ' d like to welcome you to this the latest of our series of
saturday morning interview programmes
here on radio three in which i talk to leading figures in hong
kong about themselves their lives their activities and whatever else is on
their mind this weekend 
i ' m very please to have my guest this morning may ng who
is director of friends of the earth organization here in hong kong which uh
as many of you will no doubt know is concern of the whole quality of
the environment and uh the place in which we live
imagine this weekend that you went to a quick tour around hong
kong island the new territories the outline islands uh cross the water
seashore
what uh is all the negative question to solve with
uh what would be the environmental black spots which you expect to
meet
what would most worry you 
well you know for uh uh all average hong kong citizen i ' m
sure you like to take a walk in a country parks 
and as you notice all the litters that ' s left behind particularly
near barbecue site
and some of them being throw out it on in on to the sea
 that is really quite an unsightly
you know uh uh scene you want to see on a weekend morning
and then of course the regular traffic jams on major you know
 one-word 
uhm i i i think that is already getting people a bit educated 
 and getting around town is making life very a big stressful
and also getting into mtr i ' m i ' m sure everybody
had that experience
and also tut if you character look at the middle 
a lot of these uh container dump site in our new territorie 
if you take a drive near sha tau kok you know
the kam tin road
 there ' s so many degrad degrad uh
 de desolated lands which are being abused and re illegally
used as storage container dumps and old car and old tyres dumps
that is not what hong kong is proud of is it
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yes 
is that killing off the land in fact 
oh yes i mean some pollutant coming from leak
oil
 you know leakages and tut you know uh
the particularly
no fencing off and no treatment of all the no waste 
 and all these are olders that ' s coming through 
 
and also definitely i think for a lot of hong kong people
walking around about
even shopping areas in downtown or it ' s in town centre
you feel the fume of the vehicle emissions coming 
you know against the van
it ' s not a very healthy weekend one-word
 
 
 but 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm is one-word weekend
i think two of the things are true
because of air uhm uhm most one- word support
people which are air pollution and the water pollution that
just what ' s the air has that been getting worse
the air pollution or is it somewhere been for a long time really
particularly diesel uh exhaust fumes 
i guess you know the the the problem with affluence that ' s
always been more modest
 and of course there will be the vehicle increase
has really been unabated
and there ' s no strategy to really regulate vehicle growth
 and also there is no uh you know pro 
provisional uh ideas of really
uh for example using road pricing or even better
road planning and new town planning
you know public transport facilitation
unfortunately the air pollution problem has been with us for quite
a while 
but the hong kong government had been you know really call
 sort one option approach which is it
look at it
you know the particular are the source of the pollutants
which is coming from diesel engine 
actually majority of that pollutant comes from major feet 
from our public buses
and yet you know what have they done 
there ' s a big question you know what
you know now we are of course taking charge of this small diesel
engine like mini buses and taxi drivers
but you know we should be really realistically look at you know a
 levelized option to look at uh
what kind of newest technology is available
uhm how how is the casting of this switch
you know from diesel to petrol from 
diesel to uh lpg or from diesel to electric uh whatever
you know we should be given a full option of what to deal with all
these diesel engines
but unfortunately we haven't you know have a what it
is plan with one option 
and uhm that ' s why it has you know met with you know such
oppositions
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
but what would be the environment did you doing
i mean landing is loose to reduce the amount diesel to 
two-words yes
how can that be done most effectively 
definitely i think uh with uh the the best so far is
actually good maintenance
 uh you know for diesel engine 
 
 uhm 
 for diesel engine themselves 
right
but unfortunately taxi drivers wouldn't like to take off half a day
 you know form their money making exercises
you know to have their engines but very one-word
 check and maintained
and a lot of them they just thought you know this is really a minor
thing
uh what they really need is to be given the uh uh technical uh
assistance and guideline to get a good certified gauges to do good
maintenance programme
 
 uhm 
uhm
then how much the air pollution is also uhm from factories
across the bounder in china coming in hong kong
i mean it seems recently people talk about a lot of industrial
point to that
you seems a great hates uh uh towards uh shenzhen
but uhm is that something which is imagine or real
do you think 
well definitely before hong kong is you know of our our
industry has been really quite a good uh you know stationary source of air
pollutant
 but then as the economic development happening in
china so many relocate north 
now with the north wind blowing suddenly we have to sort of have
the impact of air pollution as well
but unfortunately i think in the past few years due to lack of
communications and co cooperation between them you know uh hong kong
and and our neighbour across the bounder
there has been really very minimal uh understanding of a base line
data
 you know how much of the pollutant
you know actually comes from there base line 
datas of you know the the type of pollutants particularly you know
 su uh sulphur dioxide nitrogen dioxide you know
we need have a very good base line data
and then base on that to understand year by year the increase
slow pollutants and then also to tackle uh legal enforcements 
 
 uhm 
 i know 
 yes 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yes from there yes 
 uhm 
that can be tackled to the source
you can't stop something in the wind blowing over over abroad
you can't be right there ' s no one can do
 that that
how effective is the monitoring do you think of air pollution
i mean what ' s here story in fact lot of the official
monitoring is done on the top of buildings where the pollution is not at the
level as it is as it we breathe in in the street 
 right right 
 uh ha 
yeah in fact there ' s a lot of hong kong people question about the
air pollution index that the government try to set up last
you know year
and uh and uh they were saying you know how realistic it it is
because most of our hong kong population we sort of go to work go
back home and you know take uhm uhm you know city buses
 and we are on the road level 
and a lot of these of course uh initially in uh ten years ago when
the monitoring station was set up was to monitor industry particularly the
stationary source of pollutants 
and now knowing that all these are relocated north 
very special they remaining uhm major impact of air
pollution is on ground level
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 one-word uh 
uhm
cause we did a a paper we uh hire some monitoring machines and
put them up varies street level places uh last year
and certainly that the figures we got a very different from
the official figures 
well which uh show what people actually breathing in 
 oh yes 
well mind you we got to really be worried about tunnel air 
 qualities and major bus stop terminal air qualities
all these isolating engine they are one-word
 up 
you know in mission and there we are waiting for our public
transport
i mean there is a dilemma there
you encouraging people to take public transport and here you
breathing in all these you know exhaust
 
 uhm 
 yes 
to those who want to keep motor going so you keep the air
conditioning
 that ' s why that ' s cool inside 
inside
everything is paradox
what about the water
the habour and uh the the water quality
again something you mention early round
uh walking round from two- words sai kung
country park
you come across the lovely isolated little beach and it ' s half
covered with plastic and other rubbish and so on
uhm all the wish is be thrown into the sea somewhere else and
wash up
is there any way of checking this or controlling this 
 do you think 
 right 
 that ' s a paradox you know 
 well let me tell you
i think the government need to work out their own better
cooperation and planning
because here ' s the marine department who say hey this is from
land refuge
you know actually you beach goers you know you hikers you
barbecue 
 
 yes several words in another
week we on this porgramme
we were talking on resort there was landed 
 right 
and then the the urban council or regional council manage a beach
say hey wait a minute
it ' s all from you know the the ocean
and the need of fishing feed you know the the junks and the
you know the the the ships uh you know who cross our ocean has been dumping
 
you know we need to really whatever the source it is
the better cooperation between government departments is really
necessary to come to groups with such a problem 
and of course with the epd and education department come into
picture
better public education and awareness programme
further more penalties should be considered
you know now we are seriously thinking about smoky vehicles
brought uh uh you know uh penalties why not the same with you know people who
just litterous 
 who care nothing about you know our natural
species and our shorelines 
 
 several words 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yes 
 uhm uhm
how lev how high do you think the level of 
one-word 
i mean something you are in opposite
you are working on a whole time
i would like it it cannot be high enough for you 
did you hear about the latest survey from uh chinese
university uh no uh i think hong kong university
we you know they did uh uh uh uh people uh hong kong public uh
awareness uh uh environmental awareness uhm survey
they call up hund a thousand five hundred people by
telephone
and uh you know what the result is
ninety percent of them said yes i would certainly support the
environment
the rest of them well if i have to pay sorry i ' m
 i ' m i ' m not sure
and well we place its uh ranking with the other rest of the world
 tut with thirty nine cities
 we rank last as number thirty nine
in our environmental awareness and support for the environment
even behind china which has fifty nine percent supporting
environment
and india we know who is even better than we do 
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 in 
 uhm 
this is jonathan fenby talking to may ng from friends of the
earth
here on radio three the saturday morning
this is all are worrying a negative result
but there are positive side of the environment one-word
 here
still country parks trees 
one-word and so on
what uhm do do you find most precious there 
 oh yes 
 yes 
well i i i guess you know thanks to the to the you know hong kong
government i think
uh par particularly governor maclehose who has put in
place a very good country park ordinance who protected fourteen percent of
our country of our land which is turn into country park beautiful country
park
and mind you we have five hundred kilometers of beautiful
coastline and which really uh you know wonders in you
know in this part of the world
and uh but we don't forget you know that ' s all recent
misleading thought that hong kong has no biodiversity no no special species
 we have two two thousand five hundred
vernacular plants species even more than uk 
and uh you know our our tree species is so
special
 it ' s even more than all western 
european put together 
and and and and then there is also tut you know
the completeness of our transport system which take us everywhere
there ' s no need for cars
and and i i think hong kong people are not really uh brought to
the to the uh uh uh attention that such treasures is really very special for
hong kong
and that makes it attractive for our most revenue generating
industry tourism industry
that what brings thousand you know eight hundred 
was it eighty billion uh hong kong dollars uh
eighteen billion eight hundred billion hong kong dollars every
year 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 the tree yeah yeah 
 uhm 
 in europe they have some one-word 
 uhm 
 eight billion 
but most of the visitors don't how to
country park let ' s say
and for most of the image of hong kong is that very much of a
compact uh glass and concrete and steel city 
right
but then there is a potential to increase this kind of ego ego
tourism
 and there is potential to even you know a need you
know in this areas particularly link up with china
and what better potential there is for for hong kong enrich
treasure
what we ' ve got as our natural asset uh that
is one area which you know we can think of
but you know in a brighter picture actually hong kong can look
future in the next fifty years if we take care of you know the uhm the number
of people we can accommodate here
presently we have six million but as we you know
according to the uh census we have taken
an increase of a million every decade
we will be heading towards ten million people by fifty years from
now
now the picture in front of this how do we fulfill the need of
these many people
unless government policy are made very missionary proactive now to
start and think
and here ' s the good opportunity for a future executive mr tung a
golden opportunity to say hey let ' s stand stand back
and look at what decision are being made
and do we can we cope with ten million people
and now that golden opportunities there are areas for innovative
solutions
you know like for energy need we can actually tap into you
know our own solar energy
you know we got one thousand and ninety one kilometers square
of landmarks which has you know uh uh you know an an solar
energy
and that keep uh actually produce you know five thousand seven
hundred and sixty two billion mega one-word of solar 
energy per year 
yes and we have in make best use of it one-word
 we ' ve got the coastline uhm for wind energy 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 sound one-word 
 are you worry about the land use 
 definitely i i think uh we hope the future
 uh chief executive would really you know commit to also
protection of a country park while also better use of our lands
look at the you know illegal the the dumping site in new 
territorie 
 if we can really put that as a priority to
rehabilitate them to turn into good uses
and and also urban renewal that has been put in a very low 
 priority 
there ' s always constant cry for oh no oh not enough land to
hold you know to uh uh accommodate ten million people
or reclaim the harbour you know that ' s the
easiest the the the shortest and the the the revenue generating
option 
but here we have the graded one-word to be
 rehabilitated 
there urban renewal that has to be really you know 
one-word 
 
 uh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 so that ' s why the two-words yes 
yes 
 uhm 
there ' s also old building which can be uh
renewed and one-word 
 right 
 maybe even change of you know use
like a lot of industries relocated to to to china
there is a lot of industrial buildings which
are sitting there empty
because of you know the land use or because the you know the
the the original use is needed to be which uh rethink 
and no change
so i think in more innovative and more creative solutions 
needs to be thought out
you know to fulfill the need of that many people and their demand
for housing
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
how much political awareness is there concern among politicians
you write to mr tung and then you write an open letter to him uh
on environmental future or
do politicians here give much time much concern you think to this
kind of environmental matters 
unfortunately i guess uh we have a very few channels for
lobbying 
uh previously and of course we try mr uh patten 
 
uh i guess his hands his hands too full and uh he had other
priorities
uhm then we try 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 one-word did they lay out
quite a lot of environmental programme in the first year
 oh yes 
yes he he he committed a a very big budget
 he he he so increase manpower for the
 environmental protection department you know good budget
i think he cared but he had such no time
but then you know with legislators here and politicians we find it
very difficult to help them see you know there are long term you know
gains and benefit
you know if the qu we ' ve we are talking about 
livelihood issue
we ' ve been talking about quality of life issues
but particularly they are just looking at short term it uh you
know result
and short term you know benefit without really looking at long
term
and uh we ' ve found we have few legislators to lobby uh you only a
few committed
if you look at the reason uh to deal with air pollution
the uhm the proposal to change uh to uh urge taxi dri 
uh one-word to change from diesel to petr
 uh petrol
that is the vote is so shameful
you know uhm uhm majority don't even support such an initiative
like you said
it could be intern measure
we can deal with air pollution for the moment while we try to more
innovative
you know long term technology quick uh you know
fix uh fixation of this problem
but we found that so difficult
because they are catering the need of their voters uh to their you
know the taxi drivers could be one strong voices 
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 petrol uhm 
 uhm 
 a quite of taxi drivers without the drivers
and give you light driving cars
