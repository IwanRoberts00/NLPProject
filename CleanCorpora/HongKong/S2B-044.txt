uh mr chairman uh ladies and gentlemen  hello
""
given the  manufacturer  employment fallen to only about
seven hundred thousand now from over one hundred thousand about ten years ago
and the trend is for further relocations of hong kong manufacturing to other
part of the world there are concerns that hong kong may degenerate into
so-called a hollow economy without any real production capability which may
also cause mass unemployment
""
i feel that hong kong should have sufficient flexibility to adapt to
the changing external environment and can maintain a reasonable growth rate
of about five point five percent in real terms in the nineteen nineties 
""
the possible social disturbance should be tolerable if the economic
restructuring is proceeding gradually
""
in the following i highlight the major challenges facing by hong
kong industrialists today
""
i do not pretend to know the answers to all the questions but
hopefully i can throw some light to the issues 
""
hong kong mainly due to a lack of active government assistance and a
relatively small domestic economy has lagged behind south korea taiwan and
singapore in pursuing high technology
""
however i think hong kong will continue to find a dominant position
in the mass consumption market despite growing competition from malaysia
indonesia and also thailand
""
these hong kong industrial companies have been producing in china
other asian countries and many other low-cost nations in the world with
marketing designing prototype development sourcing logistic support
management and control located in hong kong
""
apart from being able to produce in low-cost areas hong kong
industrialists are more capable of meeting quality standards demanded by
oversea investors and buyers
""
as customers tend to stock less because of shorter product life
cycles and shorter economic cycles in many importing countries manufacturers
have to face tighter delivery schedules
""
as buyers become increasingly demanding flexibility and the ability
to respond quickly are the strength hong kong manufacturers count on to
maintain the ultimate competitive advantage
""
a limited number of high-tech companies may be developed in hong
kong in the longer term probably with a co-operation with china  ' s high-tech
industries but they are not likely to become the main stream of the hong kong
industry  ' s backbone
""
as for the second generation of industrialists in hong kong their
operating and competing environment are very different from that of the first
generation of industrialists
""
hard working is not sufficient for sustaining and expanding their
business i think a global perspective and the ability to access risk of
multiple dimensions are the necessary conditions
""
since most of the second generation of the industrialists are
having their higher education in other advanced countries they should be able
to adapt themselves much better as compare to the elder generation
""
furthermore i think is very important for them to developed their
social and political awareness both for the context of hong kong and also
china
""
the opening of china and its deepening economic reforms provide the
best opportunities for hong kong manufacturers to develop further i think
more and more businessmen in hong kong recognise this potential
""
the favourable factors include land and labour cost remaining low
for a long time improving labour productivity now in china and china  ' s vast
domestic market is likely to opened in the longer term
""
nevertheless i think it  ' s very important to for industrialists to
spend more effort to understand the longer term economic development strategy
required in china
""
since the world is changing very rapidly it  ' s essential to set up
a global information network
""
different countries are still having different production 
product and market requirement and practices such information is vital for
further expansion
""
the shortening of  product life-cycle requires more product
diversification as well to safeguard the bottom-line of the company
""
quicker responses to market conditions are also essential obviously
""
as highlighted by s k already hong kong does not have the tradition
and ability to develop our own high-tech industry i think the government
should involve more directly to upgrade the technological level of the hong
kong industry as a whole
""
the setting up of the industry and technology development council
is a recent step in the right direction
""
their adaptation of some existing technology to hong kong  ' s
context may be the most cost effective solution to find a way to take china  ' s
target potential seems to be a major challenge now to hong kong  ' s industry
to upgrade its technology
""
other than the technology  issue funding is also a major concern
industrial companies require financial supports for expansion interest rates
in hong kong are likely to be high in the years ahead mainly because of the
new airport project more new financial products will also be available
""
i think it  ' s essential for industrialist to know their  f 
financing options better and also to schedule their expansion plan further
ahead
""
as on the labour side hong kong will be having a much better
educated and demanding labour force shorter work-week will also be developed
labour demand will be entertained by a more substantiated way because of a
more democratic government
""
owners of the companies and employees should treat each other
fairly to develop some sort of a partner and co-operative relationship
""
a bilateral mechanism for negotiation between the employers and
employees i think should be established
""
given the slowly  growing labour power the traditional
industrial government relation has also been changing in hong kong as i just
said we are having a more democratic government  people  ' s and labour  ' s
power is a new element in the equation to affect the industry than government
relations
""
it  ' s important for the industry to be better organised and to
present their interest with better arguments and a more comprehensive
lobbying effort in a more open fashion 
""
as hong kong people also become more environmental conscious there
will be market and social pressure to develop  environmental friendly
production process to develop environmental friendly products and also to pay
for pollution this will also demand more direct management and government
involvement
""
industrialists who can respond to this  several-words
 should see some ample profit opportunities 
""
summing up i think the business opportunities in the nineties for
hong kong industrialists are much better than in the nineteen eighties
""
however it  ' s very important for the industrialist to respond
 1 word  to many new challenges including  shorter
product life-cycle  shorter economic cycles in many of our  exporting
countries  segregated international markets  changing political
environment  rising labour power  financing  1-word 
and also environmental concerns
""
i think it  ' s important for industrialists  to responds to these
challenges in order to capture the benefits of the business potentials of a
 1-word  by china and also by the other part of the world
""
thank you 
""
""
""
thank you professor siu uh ladies and gentlemen i am very
pleased to be here to welcome all of you to attend this seminar
""
as a member of the board of governor and the college council of
lingnan college i am particularly proud that  today  ' s seminar is
organised by the centre for international business studies  of the lingnan
college
""
since its establishment in late nineteen ninety this centre has
organised  has organised two major international seminars  which were
very well received
""
this seminar is another example of the fine work of this  centre
""
as the title of this seminar implies we are going to face new
challenges both in trade and industry in the years to come 
""
we have heard much about protectionism and trade embargo both of
which are detrimental to trade  very often these two tactics are taken in
an attempt to achieve certain political objectives
""
large nations use trade embargo as well as other methods such as
reduction of import quotas as a bargaining weapon to force other nations into
submission  and to use protectionism to retaliate against those that enjoy
good trade surplus 
""
rightly or wrongly politic plays a major role in international
trade 
""
recently we have seen how trade embargo has been used on iraq libya
vietnam and further back on south africa and cuba  it is a powerful weapon
but  re  rarely will it cost a change in the government of nation
subjected to  the embargo
""
very close to us china is threatened with the removal of the most
favoured nation status by the united state
""
being a major a trading partner with china this has serious
implication on us 
""
china has been singled out for human right violations because it
enjoys huge trade surplus with the united state
""
i don't have any statistics but i am quite sure china is no worse
than many of the developing countries in terms of human right violations
""
what rights do singaporeans have when they aren't allowed to chew
gums  may be this is treated more as a joke  than human right violation
""
locking up dissidents is more serious and deserves different
treatment but locking up dissidents is a common practice outside of north
america and western europe  should there be equal treatment or special
treatment
""
will the recent riots in los angeles and other cities in the states
make any difference in us  ' s attitude toward china
""
does recession have any effect on us  ' s foreign trade policy
""
we have two knowledgeable speakers who can shed some light on this
topic 
""
industry is the backbone of international trade the industrial
scene in hong kong has been changing over the past ten years with much of the
labour intensive operation relocated in china what remains in hong kong is
more sophisticated type manufacturing
""
instead of being a manufacturing centre hong kong has become a
manufacturing management and marketing centre 
""
we are heavily dependent on one market the us market for our
manufactured goods this makes our position vulnerable  and common sense
tells us to avoid vulnerability 
""
remarkable changes have taken place in europe in nineteen ninety
one  these changes may open doors to new markets
""
many manufacturers and exporters have already re-examined the
location of the production and markets for their products  those that have
not yet done so may want to do so soon
""
i hope speakers in the session two can enlighten us on this
""
in closing i want to wish all the participants a successful seminar
and i also want to thank the speakers in advance for sharing with us their
thoughts and experiences
""
thank you 
""
""
""
uh thank you uh professor siu
""
uh good afternoon ladies and gentlemen uh i  ' m very glad to be here
but i  ' m sure that my talk would not be as exciting as paul cheng  ' s because
our problem related to technology uh tend to be longer term than than mfn
""
uh the subject i  ' m going to talk about is uh technology challenges
uh in hong kong industry
""
and  i think i i was present at the first session and one
speaker did ask a question whether in claiming part successes uh  whether
we have actually  for  forgotten the importance of of technology in in
the future development of hong kong industry uh that question was raised
""
and and i hope i i  ' m able to provide a list of partial answer to
to that particular question i think technology is directly related to the
theme of today  ' s seminar because given a certain cost structure the trade
performers is directly related to the level of technology application in
industry
""
our ability to complete is dependent on the extent to which we can
apply technology trade or industry
""
uh what i shall try to do is to try to outline the changing
industrial scene in hong kong describe the role of technology in our
industrial development and then try to elaborate on the on the technological
challenges facing hong kong and i would conclude by outlining the initiatives
required to move forward
""
uh as we all know the hong kong economy  ' s under restructuring uh
but there  ' s a lot of  misinterpretation about the nature of this
restructuring uh i have my personal view and and uh   stat  if you
look at the statistics it  ' s easy to draw conclusions one can say that the
manufacturing share of gdp dropped from twenty two percent in eighty seven to
about eighteen  per  eighteen percent in nineteen ninety
""
the number of  work  the number of workers expressed as as a
percentage of the total work force also decreased from thirty two to twenty
six percent during the same period
""
so one can conclude that actually manufacturing industry is
declining and then we are shifting to what we call a service-oriented economy
""
uhm and we know that the  the declining numbers is partly due to
the relocation of labour intensive industries to southern china it is
estimated that hong kong investors employ about three million workers in the
pearl river delta 
""
so so is is manufacturing industry really declining
""
my own view is that without conducting a vigorous input output
analysis it is easy to underestimate the positive economic impact of hong
kong  ' s manufacturing industry located both in hong kong and southern china
""
part of the problem of the hong kong  st   stat 
statistic is that they do not indicate the service content in manufacturing
and they many people associate manufacturing with the concept that is really
assembly work
""
as the manufacturing  in  industry increases in  soph
 in sophistication the service content in manufacturing also increases
""
""
take take a japanese factory uh which i  ' ve recently  vis 
visited for example this is a ball  bearing  factory and although it
employ something like forty to fifty direct workers on the factory floor they
have a team of two hundred designers responsible for improving
manufacturability and upgrading quality
""
if it the same factories it is re-located in hong kong and if the
assembly work is moved across south china to south china then uh we can look
at this design team and say they are service workers 
""
and and and uh this is the need of the whole misinterpretation of
the changing uh industrial structure in hong kong
""
manufacturing does not mean assembly alone and assembly usually
represent less than ten percent of the cost of a more sophisticated product
