school timetabling  tasks  uh can be roughly  di 
uh divided into two part
""
the first part is called timetable planning the other part is called
timetable  si  scheduling
""
uh the timetable planning is that  uhm we have some people
usually are senior staff member in the school 
""
uh he or she will identify  the resources that will be needed 
in order to  uh  uh uh uh to conduct a lesson
""
for example uh  what sort of room will be used for a particular
particular lesson
""
for example pe of course uh physical education  lesson will need
to use uh playground 
""
so  those  first of all we have to associate all those
resources with the lesson need
""
and we have  uhm we we also need to identify any resources
constraint such as uh  uh resource  are weak  in budget
""
uh for example whether a teacher will available at a particular time
""
or whether a room or class will be available et cetera 
""
uh  we also need to identify all the timetable uh timetabling
constraint happens such as uhm many school would have  these  sort of
requirement
""
or no pe lesson after lunch
""
i mean it maybe maybe after lunch
""
and uh they are very  uh uh particular uhm  uhm 
constraints in some some schools
""
for example some  primary school would have a constraint such
that pe lesson or particular class will not be conducted in successive base
""
uhm the reason is uh  quite quite strange to me
""
cause uh they they do have a reason
""
uhm  the reason is uhm
""
when a when a pupil  have a pe lesson
""
then he uh when when he or she  uh go uh when he or she uh goes
home
""
then the  they need to wash their pe uniform and uh the 
""
therefore the uhm the uniform may not be able to dry up you uh in
time
""
so that  ' s why they need to  uh have 
""
they they need to uh separate  the pe lesson for uh for for 
primary school
""
and what  with  identify all those uh constraint maybe
course available
""
then of course we need  to assign or some teacher to conduct to
some lesson
""
i what but  but uh when i said assign uh i mean associating uh
lessons with uh teachings that  ' s all
""
so  for example uhm  teacher a maybe assigned to teach a
number of classes for a particular subject  uh with a particular number of
meeting uh number of lessons
""
of course we also need to identify how long the lesson would be
would that be  ten uh single period lesson
""
or would that would that be uh two single period lesson and 
three double period lesson et cetera 
""
so usually now this i think all these tasks will be prepared by a
senior staff member in the school 
""
however the scheduling tasks may not be done by the senior staff
""
it maybe done by some junior staff
""
you know that it  ' s a very  one- word  task
""
so  senior  staff can ask somebody to help them
""
and uhm  we we understand that the task is to assign all lessons
 uh  to the schoolmaster  ' s timetable
""
so that all constraint will be satisfied
""
and any preferences  or if there are any preferences  then uh
we help you uhm
""
then she will then as many as  uhm  as many preferences as
possible will be fixed by as well
""
and uh usually we will uh find that uh at the end of the timetable
 process i would
""
when i say at the end of the timetabling process i mean
""
uh even though uh when we use a computer to try to solve the
problem
""
usually we won't be able to solve them all
""
then maybe uh three percent of the lessons need to be addressed uh
manually
""
and  uh  it is uhm not unusual to pick uh more than hundred
many hours completed to to complete the whole task 
""
and uh i  ' ll give you some supporting evidences in a  min 
in a minute 
""
and uhm in  nineteen ninety  nineteen ninety five uh
education department  uh introduced its first timetabling software for
school use
""
it  ' s called pdss
""
uh pdss  uh in fact  uh was awaking uh as a annual field
project in uhm uhm chinese u
""
and uhm  in uhm  ninety five of 
""
uhm the work has been customized and uh introduced for school use
""
and uh it is integrated as a part of uh tbss
""
uh sorry as a  sams  component
""
and uh the system was written in c in c language
""
uhm so the integration of uh tdss to  sams  is not as kind
 as uh ed would like to see
""
because uhm  they use uh two different setup environments
""
and uhm  for those who don't have any ideas on  sams 
""
 sams  is a school administrating system offered by the ed
for school use
""
and uhm in the  uhm back engine of the  uhm system
""
i mean the  sams course  system  uh is  one-word
 
""
and pdss was decided as a decision support system
""
uhm the idea  uh was uh it is very hard for uh computer to able
to know all the uh all the proper decision but uh the  decision  rule
that have  been uh inside the mind of a timetabling expert
""
so the there will be kind of  thing is much uh better
""
it is a much better idea to  have a system  which provide
some constraint package as well as  some uh  decision tools to aim the
timetable or the timetabling to do the job 
""
and  next i would like to uh introduce uh the  good surveys
that i mentioned early
""
the first one  uh was conducted by  uh  a number of
researchers
""
uh by kwok kwong and  one-word  of  uhm
""
doctor kwok is from the uhm city university and mr kwong is
currently work uh as a lecturer in the  in the uhm   one-word
  hong kong i  ed 
""
i  ' m not quite sure  where  ' s  uhm about him
""
and uhm they conduct the survey in october nineteen ninety nineteen
ninety five 
""
and uhm  aim is  to try to understand the timetabling
problem for secondary schools
""
and uh they send  out all hundred and eighty questionnaire
""
or which covers almost  all  the secondary schools in hong
kong
""
and uh one hundred and seventy three uh were returned 
""
and uh what  as we known though
""
most of the   respondings  are are of are come from the
uh grammars school
""
there are a few uh  respondent from  uhm  some special
school but not many 
""
and uh what they  found  the  that uhm
""
the number of teachers in a schools around uhm fifty two or fifty
three which is an average number
""
and the number of classroom  as a test  room in a school 
is about twenty five and about uh  thirty 
""
and number of classes is around  thir  uh sorry twenty nine
""
when you read those figures then you you may notice that
""
the number of classroom  i mean the average number is twenty
five or twenty six
""
however the number of classes  is twenty nine
""
so that  ' s mean we do not have enough  spared  classroom to
support all the classes
""
that means  some of the classes will not will not  uh have
any home room 
""
and uhm quickly the number of time slot in a teaching cycle is
around uh twenty seven 
""
so most of the school will adopt a teaching cycle of five or six
days
""
and uhm for each day you will have uh eight or nine  periods of
lessons 
""
and uhm the researchers uh found the problem is quite complex in a
sense that uh the number of free
""
uh there are some uh uh free lessons uh 
""
on average there are about five uh free lessons per  time slot
""
when i when i say a  free  lesson that means a lesson will
""
""
uh a class of student will be split into two or more groups
""
so that they have to go to different rooms to attend the lesson
""
so at least two rooms and two teachers will be asked to attend a
free lesson
""
and the situation will be getting more complicated if we have to
split and combine
""
so perhaps we have three group of students split into 
""
sorry three classes of students split into five groups
""
and uh they maybe taught by uh different uh teachers in different
 venue
""
and of course there are more complicated uh timetabling
requirement
""
and i  ' ll uh give you some idea on on those requirement uh later
on 
""
and uhm there are uh double period and  thirdable  period
lesson as well
""
uhm  it sounds of  uhm it sounds of quite usual with the why
 uh i mention it that
""
i mention are those further case instead  of who would not
allow uh  uh the multi period lessons to be uh  placed across recess or
lunch
""
that is the usual case
""
uh however they they had there are some school uhm  such that
they they they may allow uh to have multi period lesson  it  places
across recess if they are not able to find a  sit  any other suitable
places for those lessons 
""
so if we have more this sort of multi period lessons that means uh
we we do not have  uh   tut 
""
or we may have a a a smaller degree of flexibility in placing
those period into a time into a timetable
""
and uhm  regarding the timetabling method on 
""
they found the average number of hours  spended  or in
constructing a timetable at that time  would be uh around a hundred and
sixty  hour  
""
and uh  uh  no notice that this particular figure include uh
those school who construct their timetable manually or with the use of
computer 
""
uhm  so  it it will  depend  more data about the
degree of population of that is a use of that can use with a with the
timetabling task
""
all twenty two percent  uhm conduct the timetabling task
manually
""
and uhm the rest seventy eight percent use a  several
words 
""
however only three five percent uh
""
sorry five uh twenty five percent of uh schools use computer only
for constraint checking  that means uh they have to make a decision where
to put a particular uh lessons onto the master timetable
""
so it  ' s  one-word  uh manual  de  uh
uhm decision to be done manually
""
so basically the scheduling task is performed by the human being
""
""
and  the other twenty five percent are in use some uhm
 one-word 
""
uhm sorry use the computer tools to uh generate the timetable uh
 one-word 
""
uh however these twenty five percent of people had to do  some
 many work after the  timetabling  process
""
because uh they found the the  pins  was not worth enough
to generate the whole timetable for them 
""
only around nine percent of the schools  care 
""
they were able to generate the whole timetable with the with the
use of the   one-word  timetable software
""
because if we look at these
""
uh you may sum up these two figure  then you can see that uh uh
 about fifty seven percent of schools generate the timetable manually 
a long pause 
""
and  uh they also look at uhm those completion rate of or the
computer tools adopted by the uh is uh by the school at that time
""
and  they uhm  select all the  resound  all the the
uh related data
""
and uh  then uh analysis the data and find that  the mean
completion rate was extremely low
""
it was only sixty seven percent
""
that means uh if you if a school have a one hundred 
""
sorry uh one thousand time slot to fill in
""
then uh we we can just fill in six hundred and seventy
""
so that that means there are a lot of periods to be filled up okay
but manually 
""
and uh  that is  uhm uh  three words 
""
because of many  uhm many timetables in school
""
it try to use some timetabling tools
""
and however at the end they they found the time to uh to spend on
many  uh timetabling at the end is almost the same  as those time used
to  uh construct a timetable manually at the beginning
""
so  uh  the figure was  not or satisfactory or is nice or
say  encouraging 
""
and uhm  but we have to uhm understand that at that time they
""
""
there were no uh  goods  timetabling software on the market
""
uh  for those who use a a timetabling system to  make 
school timetable uhm
""
sixty six percent they  face  their software from the
market
""
uhm fourteen percent uh develop their own  their own uh
timetabling software and they were very 
""
they they were very brave
""
and uh in fact uh the developing of timetabling system is a very
challenging task
""
and uh only fourteen percent use  pes pdss because  uh pess
was just launched at that time
""
and the this particular survey was conducted in october nineteen
uh ninety five
""
so just a few month after the launch of the of pdss
""
that that account why there are so few school using the software
""
and uhm  yes a few school uhm uh ask some software  cost
 to be  divide  a software system for that 
""
and uh in  nine in march nineteen ninety uh nineteen ninety
nine i conduct a similar survey
""
and uhm  i  i try to understand a little bit more on
timetabling  require  uh  of secondary schools
""
and uh uh i also uh would like to  see whether uhm  more
school are start to use uh  automated  timetabling software to do with
the timetabling task
""
and  uhm more importantly i would like to know or whether
school uh whether uhm uh automated system would really help to reduce school
workload
