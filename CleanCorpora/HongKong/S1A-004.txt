 uhm uhm  
 
""
if you wash it few times uh     but it  ' s cheaper if
you buy it from there right     than from uh welcome or 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 yes  
""
yes sure
 
""
uhm   but most   but most people in hong kong
they go out to eat  they go to  rest s  small restaurant 
two words  because it  ' s   quite  
""
""
 they are fresher  
""
""
 fast   food shop    three words
 
 
""
 no no no uh you know   for porridge or noodles

 uhm uhm  
""
lazy because they  ' re  lazy
""
  lazy 
""
""
 i  ' m   lazy too
 
""
you  ' re lazy or maybe because it  ' s cheap 
""
""
quite   cheap 
 
""

""
it  ' s uh what twelve twelve dollars fourteen dollars   
""
""
is that considered cheap 
""
""
 uh uh  
""
uhm yes   i think so 
 
""
 it is   
""
""
for you it  ' s cheap
 
""
how about for you 
""
""
for me it  ' s expensive because i  ' m a   student 
""
""
 student   
$a and
$b laughed 
 
""
yeah but even as a student you still have some money right 
""
""
no   
$a and
$b laughed  
 
""
 no   oh you when you are graduate you  ' ll be earning
lots of money    right  
""
""
 yeah i hope   so
""
i  ' ve borrowed a lot of money from the government
 
""
to go to school so you have to pay it back 
""
""
yeah  in five years
 
""
in five years
""
what  ' s the interest rate 
""
""
  two 
""
""
 two   point five
""
""
two point five percent
""
""
yeah
 
""
that  ' s very good 
""
""
yeah
 
""
actually you  ' re earning money because inflation is nine percent
""
""
""
yes but you put the money in the bank only one point five
interest
 
""
oh i know but you see 
$a and
$b laughed  you are using money  that  ' s worth two point five percent
to the person who borrowed it     but  to him the money is
decreasing by nine percent every year so you  ' re actually making money  or
he  ' s losing money or the government is losing money actually 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
the government is very wealthy
 
""
yeah so do most most students at the university  uh borrow
money from the government to go to school 
""
""
oh most of them
 
""
yeah what percentage 
""
""
i think     oh uhm  eight percentage
""

""
""
 the same  
 
""
more than fifty percent 
""
""

""
""
more than seventy  one word 
""
""
oh  laughed 
 
""
more than seventy 
""
""
maybe i don't know 
$a and
$b laughed 
 
""
i see 
""
but what about uh i mean after you graduate do you have to find
your own job or 
""
""
yes but i find it is very difficult to find a job
 
""
what kind of job do you want 
""
""
uhm just just working  business areas
 
""

""
""

""
""

thirty dollars    for  aiwa cd player

""
the the percentage of the rent it uh takes the  most of the
salary
""
""
yes   about  more than fifty percent
 
""
 uhm   
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""

do you think it  ' s a good thing that     the
governor is uh 
""
""
  one word   
""

i i don't know there i think  there are many  consequences

very hard to because hong kong is a  free economy

  how can you  do that

 right  
""
right 
""

you can't cut down the prices

a  commodity you can trade you know easily

it  ' s a need  you know

people need to live in houses otherwise you have  uhm people
living on the streets    right
