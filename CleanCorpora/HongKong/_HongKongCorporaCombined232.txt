the very first thing i have to do is introduce this factory to my friend you two and this is the factory of amway and some people wondering are we working for amway this factory the answer is no amway is just a factory it pro it is producing goods for us to sell  okay now you are looking at picture this is the picture of this factory and uhm it is located in  in the united states uhm so called michigan something like that and here is the lake this this lake is owned by this factory and most of the products of amway products have to be produced by water so they have to  uhm have their own lake to supply own water okay next one next page and here is some little bit background about amway factory and it started by a very hard 1 word in  several words of a petrol station and here ' s uh peter island for the people recognition and some people do pretty good and they they will be invited by amway  factory to enjoy their holiday on there and here ' s the amway grand plaza hotel and it

australia like british like  uh hong kong and in hong kong it ' s it is started by nineteen seventy-four  and going here and you are don't wor you don't have to worry about this picture ju just some people worry about that how many goods we can sell how many goods we can take from amway factory and then we  we we tell to the customer when you see up here you can you ' ll know there ' s a lot of product and the very big variety of course we can choose to sell and you don't have to sell them all  but you just choose one of them or you can sell them all just up to you like home care product saa

save a lot of energy and it doesn't need lot of water and   you just use a lot of food and it save the water save the water  water in the food and keep the food in a high nutrition quality and some knives some chief knife some shearing and scissor  chinese wok and this wok is produced only by for i mean only produced for  the asian market it ' s because the chinese asian people they use they use the wok to cook the food so the amway factory produce it for us for asian and here ' s very potential product nutrition if people need the nutrition every day it 2 words  that very good enough nutrition from the food in their meal every day so they have to be get some more supply extra and uh like this is for weight this is weight controlling and this is for nutrition product like vitamin c vitamin b daily chewable for children and even some uh calcium and 1 word  it is for uh for bones or people just like it ' s also for women uh and here ' s some protein powder for the uh developing children someone like and a lot of goods and here ' s some personal care product like uh perfume like eau de toilette like s uh some bathing product or here ' s some cosmetic product and all the product here it is need by people everyd ay so we don't have to worry about people buy it only one time and don't want to buy it any the other time and all the product of amway is totally uhm protected if you buy if you don't satisfy you can take a refund an one hundred refund so it ens it is assured it is uh one hundred good quality for the customer  okay this is the part of amway factory it is produce goods like that and what we ' re doing all we are doing is the following like amway as as i told you it is it is just a manufacturer and in a traditional way like conventional way a convent con conventional way people use used to put the goods in the exporter and then sell it to the importer and go go through wholesaling go through retailing and then the consumer will get it just like what i what i write in the board what here  while the goods go through all here they have to take a very big cost like uh  in every step they they have to employ some people and they have to employ a lot of uh people to help them to sell the goods to next stage like advertising like land they have to hire off they have to land the office they have to uh put a lot of money on advertising and they ' ll let the exporter know it and the and then the exporter know it and also do the same thing  like the manufacturer did and then sell it to importer so like here the cost is extremely high for the goo  products probably the products is only a little money when you cost just produce from by the manufacturer but when the product go through all these stage the consumer will get a probably higher price even it is not worth so it is the idea of distributor idea of direct sale that ' s why the direct sale idea is coming out  when the manufacturer produce good just go through the people distributors like me and it go through go through me and con the consumer can buy the goods from me  and it is the thing we do and the thing manufacturer do they export the thing by themselves they they they can afford this one the transportation cost and we don't have to pay the cost of  land we don't have to rent the land for for shops we don't have to put in money capital big capital for buying a lot of goods it ' s what we do buy it uh a big amount of goo of goods we just buy what we need to do we do we just buy the amount what we need to sell to people so  capital is not a big problem for distributor and also we don't have to employ any people so labor we are the boss also we are the labor we are just doing thing by ourselves so we  also take out the cost of labor and also we don't have to worry about the management of our business it ' s because all we ' re doing is doing by myself we don't have to manage that we don't have to hire a lot of people executive people to  manage my company and all the capital here is very risky you can you can lose them all at one night time so why would why people doing amway distributor it ' s what they don't afford they don't want to afford this kind of risky cost risky  capital  so that ' s why we ' re doing it okay some people will be uh will may be ask why the amway distributor don't have a shop and don't they don't employ people and they don't have a lot of capital how they can do it a big business even  bigger than people who owns a shop  and here ' s the answer and in amway in in the amway plan there ' s nine ways of income the very third the very first way is  retailing profit that ' s mean when we buy a goods and we sell it and we will gain a profit a at once and we don't have to wait and we don't have to uh wait for wages wait for labor of months we just sell it and we ' ll get the profit and the other thing is performance bonus  performance bonus is calculated by uh monthly and the third thing is four percent leadership bonus and today i ' m going to explain this these three kind of bonus i ' m not going to explain the  oth the other in this way it take a lot of time  okay now i have to say what is retailing profit  a retailing profit is when you buy when you buy the goods from the factory and the price have to be fixed and when you sell it to your friend your consumer your customer and the also the consumer price is also fixed already you don't have to adjust that and you are not allowed to adjust that it ' s what it ' s keep a fair market so when you when you buy it and sell it you can earn at least or around thirty percent around thirty percent probably sometimes twenty-nine point nine or sometimes it ' s  thirty-two point something so thirty percent is retailing profit so i think all it is quite easy to be understand  okay the other thing is performance bonus performance bonus is a little bit complex a little bit complicated so you can pay more attention on it  uhm let me say in this way the inflation is a very important thing for the whole society it ' s because when inflation coming up the wages it is very hard to chasing up  very hard to check catch up the the inflation rate so we don't calculate our business volume by money we ' re calculating our business volume by point value this is point value and it is like this is a dishmop  for uh dish perhaps i can draw it more better  this is uh for dish cleaning you ' re washing the dishes we use this one probably it is  thirty dollars this one when i sell it and i can't say it is my volume  my point volume is probably something two point or three point may be i don't several-words  it ' s because next year the money the price of this product have to be adjusted  it ' s because the inflation is coming up to every year so probably next year is thirty-five maybe forty or maybe more or maybe less so it is when it is floating we just shift to point value and it is fixed two point is two point and forever it ' s two point and never change so get what i mean  and five hundred point here that ' s mean here ' s the amount of product it totally is five hundred point value  uhm if there is a good when you sell out in my term i ' m not going to say i have thirty dollars of business i have three point or two point or four point or ten point of business of the point value so you can get what i mean now and the performance bonus is according to your point value there is the product as i told you if you sell it now you can get thirty percent by yourself and also there is a percentage is given by amway  if you can if you if you take a lot a lot of goods uh like if you can take five hundred point value of product from amway factory  and the factory will give you another three percent another three percent and this is performance bonus i think you can understand what is performance bonus by this word performance is mean is according to what your performance is  every month so amway is giving you this monthly this is three percent and the lowest is three percent if your point value is lower than five hundred you get nothing  and one thousand and eight hundred and you can get six you can get six percent and thirty-five hundred and nine percent and up to twenty-five  thousand you can get twenty-one percent it is the highest and some people may be asking how about i get  fif fifty thousand when you you also get twenty-one percent why it ' s because the highest that you can get twenty-one percent  altogether you are getting fifty-one percent and you are now you ' re earning much more than a little bit more than the factory  and the factory is just earning an forty forty-nine forty nine percent only so 1 word one percent fo for everybody it is very high re high return  okay let ' s do a new step to calculate now maybe as assume you that you now you are amway distributor and you will know probably you can pay more attention on that and assume that you you are distributor and this month uh this is the first month and the first month you only you you don't do anything and you try to 1 word by yourself you buy it from the amway factory and you try to use it and you think you think if i if i don't satisfy with that i would i can  just get a refund and you are secure you don't have to you don't you don't have to go through the risk  only you you buy or sell some people sharing the goods to your friend one thousand point value  and one thousand point value usually how much of product we  used to buy is nowaday one point value is equal to two point seven dollar two dollar seventy cents  can you get what i mean that means this month only you you have one thousand point value just mean time two point five seven dollar two point two point seven dollar is twenty-seven hundred business volume  business volume hope you ' re not confused now
