very good evening everyone as  the last couple go forward for the second of the evening they ' ve got midnite mouse king and blessings  about to make the line complete  favourite number three top tech odds on  all clear goes up seventeen hundred metres they ' re off and running just about jumped as one  no speed in the early part  happy win drifted back and blessings with not much speed  very hard ridden in the early part is relax he ' s keen to lead as they run towards the 200 the first time  kicking up on the inside though to keep him out is jet air  favourite ' s prominent third the box seat for beasley  two ' s outside that ' s chiu wah best  crowded out three deep midnite mouse king and they race out of the straight followed by blessings by my self is second last and a space of seven or eight back to happy win who cannot keep up he ' s the tail ender  twelve hundred metres out jet air and relax go together they lead three parts top tech getting a little closer and travelling nicely as they run into the back  blessings now has the box seat run fourth the rail to his outside is chiu wah best as they go by the nine hundred  now a couple back then midnite mouse king no too far away he ' s starting to pick up the bit and pay close attention now  followed by by my self and happy win starting to tack on at this early stage  seven hundred metres out relax strides to the front  he shadows the favourite and that ' s top tech three parts away running back on the inside there is jet air he runs third fourth to his outside then is blessings  going forward chiu wah best on the back of them midnite mouse king happy win is about to take off from the tail of the field  and by myself has now dropped out to last  five hundred out  and relax a half length in front but the favourite getting closer very quickly top tech he travels well  following him into the race then is blessings un under plenty of pressure jet air then chiu wah best happy win swings wide  straightening now for the run in top tech popped the question by beasley and he ' s a length and a half in advance of blessings who gives chase midnite mouse king winding it it up over on the inside  happy win down the outside top tech in front  one hundred out trying to get on terms with him blessings jet air happy win down the outside  but top tech is going to be a little bit too good for them  top tech will take the prize it ' s going to be a photo second  blessings or jet air very close that one  over on the inside midnite mouse king followed by happy win  a big space back then to chiu wah best followed then by by myself and relax the early leader has finished last of all  ah he ' s just a little bit too good for them  even with the big weight of one thirty two  number three is the winner top tech  three is the winner top tech judge will call a photo for second blessings  but making it very interesting is jet air  uh he was under plenty of pressure coming to the turn jet air but he  raised another effort and he ' s in a photo for second with blessings  happy win who started a long run from about the six hundred looked a chance but he ' s dropped off and maybe midnite mouse king will land that fourth spot  lets pardon me let ' s have a look  we ' ve got top tech he ' ll take the prize  and this is just going to be a bob of the heads for that second spot  on back you ' d say blessings bobs back on the inside and takes that second spot this will confirm it  chiu wah best the winner  now lets have a look at the bob here now i think blessings may have bobbed back on the inside and gee that ' s an eyelash  almost a dead heat  he ' s got a habit of bobbing at the right time blessings  for these minor photos and he ' s bobbed back and made this very interesting  and it ' s good enough to a dead heat in fact he has run second so three seven six and four  three seven six and four the winner number three top tech danny beasley rode top tech for gary moore  and he ' s a four year old bay new zealand bred gelding by prince of praise from the torino mare chapel rose two wins from four starts since joining the gary moore stable  two wins one second in fact  from four starts he ' s really improved this horse no end  and really loves these staying contests number three top tech the winner carried the one thirty two pounds and carried it in pretty good style number seven is second blessings  christian reith for gordon benson  number six winding up in third jet air robbie burke p k wong and officially fourth number four midnite mouse king peter ho for k k sin  three seven six and four  and danny beasley continuing on his winning way  when he travelled on the weekend uh actually we found it  probably a bit unusual we weren't singing his praises yesterday without a winner on the uh the card last night but with the weekend score he ' s on a total of eighteen before tonight that makes it nineteen wins from around fifty two rides  so terrific strike rate here ' s the dividends and steve mooney  number three top tech nineteen sixty and ten ninety fifteen twenty and fifteen ten the q seventy two dollars the tierce six hundred and forty six  that ' s for the number three seven six heading to a break back shortly   commercial break  welcome back live here to taipo racecourse we now have the weighed in sign for the second on three seven six  top tech for gary moore and danny beasley nineteen sixty and ten ninety  seven blessings fifteen twenty and number six running third and that is jet air  and he returned fifteen dollars and ten cents  the q seventy two dollars the tierce six hundred and forty six  one and a half lengths by a nose  one fifty one neat the run time  so three runs for gary uh four runs uh that ' s the fourth run for gary moore two thirds and two wins  certainly has improved top tech and uh i must say i thought he was uh well i thought a couple of starts back might have been a bit of a query running at these trips but he ' s doing it in very very good style today carried one thirty two pounds and was just a little too strong so we now have a look at the head on replay and he really did do it easily top tech he had the issue beyond doubt  blessings was there but he ' s not really a chaser and ah he ' s just held on for second  you can see jet air running on well as is happy win and eventually though uh blessings uh fought back a little better than what he normally does just to kick back for that second position  uh you can see jet air in that lime green cap comes again to finish third  happy win not far away but actually beating him for the fourth position was the horse towards the rail in the white cap and that was midnite mouse king  let ' s have a look at the get away and coming together there just after the jump was midnite mouse king and happy win happy win getting back which is  the norm for him and likewise blessings got back in the early part coming out in front jet air but taken on by relax favourite already box seated the third top tech and he ' s outside chiu wah best  bit of money for chiu wah best tonight but he hasn't justified it to his outside was midnite mouse king we ' ve got blessings second last in your frame by myself ' s the last one you see until  you see happy win pop in and he ' s eight and nine lengths off them already  into the back and striding to the front now relax and second spot jet air  danny beasley was never going to let the leaders get too far away but he travelled nicely throughout top tech he ' s goes up now to sit second outside of the leader relax  jet air back to third blessings enjoying a nice run in fourth  off the bridle chiu wah best  on the back of him was midnite mouse king by myself and about now happy win started to pick them up and started a long run from about the seven hundred right around the outside of the field  relax still the pilot as they go towards the six hundred  in second spot the favourite travelling very nicely top tech jet air back to third blessings fourth and then to the outside of them chiu wah best about to tack on happy win  midnight mouse king was under a bit of pressure at this stage  has run on fairly and happy win that ' s him taking off right around the outside of the field  did look a definite threat coming to the return but he could sustain that run  top tech still travelling nicely and uh about now when he straightens up danny beasley pops the question to him  he got a nice break probably a length and a half to two lengths and he ' s maintained that right down the length of the straight  the other runners just couldn't pick him up and mid midnight mouse king over on the rails jet air battling along in the lime cap happy win ' s run come to an end  and uh it was top tech left to blessings to fight back on the inside for the q spot  jet air has run okay first time at the distance  now taking the double information  first of all the q place dividends for race two  three and
