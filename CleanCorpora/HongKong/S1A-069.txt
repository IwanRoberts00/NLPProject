<I>
uh actually i think i want to know more about you
so maybe you can talk something about yourself
 
okay
well uh i was twenty four years old
i was born in one-word in toronto canada
and uh there i have my brother
my parents also live there and uh that ' s basically yeah 
alright so you haven't been to other places other than can
canada
 
uh well i ' ve been to the us
uh this is my second time coming to hong kong
uh i came here about three months ago
so after i graduated that was my plan
i want to come here and seek employment 
oh seek employment
so what kind of firm company are you looking for
 
well okay let ' s start from university
 uh what i studied was urban and economic geography
 
and uh i like to do something along the line of what i studied
from 
uhm some a lot of time so that happen to be with 
the government
 planning planning principles and stuff like that
uh but since i ' ve come here
i ' ve been basically trying out for everything
and uhm uh probably along the lines of marketing 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh 
alright i see
and uhm have you have you already got one
 
as a matter of fact keith
yes i have uh as of last week
i ' ll be starting in the new year uh the third of january
i ' ll starting as this uh development company uhm 
marketing position 
 uh 
uhm uhm
how how do you get this position
i mean do do you send out a lot of letters to companies
 
i did send out a lot of resume uhm uh
unfortunately i didn't have too many interviews
i think the reason was because uh 
wow was the year end
and a lot of time i think a lot of jobs are uh vacant after
the new year 
so i guess that ' s basically why i uh i was able to land this job
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
you think it ' s difficult for you to look for jobs in hong kong
 
uh
no the opportunities are here
uhm my fault is i cannot read chinese
i cannot speak cantonese 
and uh wow i guess the jobs that i seek are ones that probably
require uh more english skills 
 uh 
 uh ha 
oh right right 
 
 that ' s one-word 
uhm the job that i will be working at uh does require that
 since a lot of their customers are north america
companies 
 uh ha 
oh that suit you uh
 
yeah that suit 
so do you have any kind of expectations with your new
job
 
i ' m expecting 
well i ' m expecting probably the best performance out of myself
 uh expecting uh team work especially 
 
uh had interviews with my superiors and uh had
tide with few colleagues and uh
well there gonna to be
it ' s going to be pretty fun anyway 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
yeah and have you ever worked in canada
 
yes i worked in an advertising company for about seven months this
year
 uh from january to around july i worked in
advertising company 
uh the reason why i left there was 
it was basically just sales and uh a lot of it
was just base on commission 
so therefore a lot of the time the or the pay fluctuate in
one week
 it maybe a thousand dollars 
the other week you make two hundred 
so you know it ' s not very stable
and you know part of the reason for come to hong kong 
aside from uh the opportunities here is
it ' s kind of like an experience i ' ve never left home before 
 
uhm even about in university i stay at home
so that ' s like a kind of vacation for me 
but now it ' s gonna to be i guess my future 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 yes that ' s right 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
alright uh
so you think uhm
how long will you take this job
i mean would you continue until nineteen ninety seven or 
whatever
 
until nineteen ninety seven
uh well it ' s it ' s hard to say
uh i think it probably most like the uh beyond nineteen ninety
seven
i ' m looking beyond nineteen ninety seven
but who knows what ' s going to happen
so uh a lot the company i think will probably move
do more businesses with china 
so i guess it would help to find learn mandarin 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
 
so i ' m looking for bet uh
looking for prosperous future basically in this company
 and it ' s hopely it can expand it
 hopely i can grow with it 
 oh 
oh that ' s good
so we have talk about so much about your job
and uhm well maybe let ' s change the topic
and uh actually what do you think of the hong kong people
 
uh well as i said i came from toronto
 and in the last five to ten years
there ' ve been a lot of hong kong people in toronto 
so in terms of the adjustment language wise
a lot of friends in toronto were uh from hong
kong or of twenty percent
uhm the people in hong kong
the atmosphere that i get is uh
or the people is very impatience 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
uh ha
 
you know society it ' s it ' s very fast moving
 four words 
and uh i don't know it ' s uh i guess that ' s
yes that ' s what you have to expect i mean the what ' s
six million people living in hong kong 
 yeah 
yeah that ' s right
 more than that more than that 
 
 six six million people okay
uh in roughly that ' s
that ' s not a very big place
 but you know i guess that you can expect impatience
people 
 uh ha 
yeah that ' s right
and what do you think of the people in canada
i mean the native canadian
 
native canadians 
what difference i mean it ' s so congested here 
 laughs 
alright uh there ' s so much basic candidates
 it ' s not even funny 
 yeah 
oh oh i see
and uhm well what do you think of the english standard of the
hong kong people
do they speak good english or poor 
 
 uh 
some 
 laughs 
uh it it englishize 
actually the english standard i think is quite low 
uh ha
 
uhm but it that ' s not interview you read about her 
 i can mean yeah
i mean i can speak cantonese solve different 
communications are the pro 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
oh right i see
so uhm that ' s good
and do you have any problems in communication at all
so do you do you speak really fluent cantonese 
 
 no i don't
my cantonese is kind of uh 
i mean you can tell that i ' m i ' m uh born in canada 
 laughs 
 two- words my cantonese
uhm although a lot of friends and relatives have said that
you know comparing with other chinese who
are born in uh north america or wherever
uh apparently mine is pretty good
 is that right
you think my cantonese is good 
 that right 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yeah i think so
 
yeah 
well that ' s good
and uhm do you make a lot of new friends here
 
uh no i haven't made any friends actually 
oh
 
uh that ' s why coming here for first two months
wow the first month coming into hong kong was very
it was like a an experience an exile experience 
uhm but after that i start getting really boring
all my friends are in canada
 i have only maybe two friends 
 uh yeah can all the two friends that are living
in hong kong in 
they work anyway so it ' s very hard to get in
touch with them
 they are so busy and stuff
and even a weekend they they are really busy so
hopefully new year eve you have to catch up with
them 
 uh ha 
 alright 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
and are you looking for so meeting more people meeting
more different 
 
 almost definite 
uh i guess
you got uh have friends 
yeah that ' s right 
 
 more of it the better 
 yeah 
right
 
right 
right
so let ' s call so
you are looking forwards to jobs as well
 
yes i am 
oh
 
of course 
uhm so we have talked about jobs
we have talked about people in hong kong
and yeah maybe well uh let see
do you have uhm a religious belief
i mean religion anything like that
 
if there ' s a word i can i can uh characterize my thinking
some word between two-words 
uh ha
 
probably more along than the the lines of one-word
 
uh ha
 
that problemize my my beliefs 
uh ha
 
uhm i was never really brought up brought up in any specific
faith or uh 
i really went to church
i might went to church once or twice in my life
 uhm but i ' m reading a lot 
i i love reading and i love reading about history 
 and one-word religion 
 uh ha 
 oh 
 uh ha 
 wow 
 you are not boring 
 
 just about 
no i i love reading about religion 
uh ha
 
and religion is probably one of the most 
wow one of the topics that is most i like to talk about 
wow
and do you have any influence from your parents
 
no
wow maybe a little
my mom is in the last five years is uh moving towards to buddhist
 buddhist way 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
 
and uh a lot of time we discuss one- word 
too 
wow cool
what and what you think of buddhism
 
i think wow the the problem is uh translation is very hard
thing to take uh
that mean when buddhism was wrap in the scripture i
mean whether it be in hindi or in chinese
 when you translated it into english
 it probably doesn't give you the same fact 
 yeah 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 oh 
uh ha
 
so uhm am i actually uh tut 
what word i ' m trying to get
move by this faith
 no no i ' m not it 
to me it ' s just uh learning world 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
oh oh
and actually in toronto have you ever come across any people
who who would preach or who will persuade you to become a christian or
 whatever 
because i think uh
yeah many people do so in toronto
 
 oh yeah 
 uh 
to hold the witness 
uh ha
 
uh i think seven day one-word does sometimes
they come to our our house and
preach 
 and uh a lot of time a lot of people would like
to you know
just lend the door on them 
 oh 
 uh ha ha 
 wow 
uh ha
 
but not me i i like to talk to them 
uh ha
 
uh uh not so much is arguing or debating
but basically try to learn more about their faith
 uh i ' m not trying to change their minds
but i like to ask questions 
uh asking questions is probably but 
probably most important thing anyone can do
 you have to get knowledges whatever 
 yeah 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
uh ha
you think you will eventually stick to one word
 
one religion 
yeah that ' s right
 
uh no one it ' s hard to say in 
i ' m really incline to move towards this uh buddhist 
 religion word like that
christianity muslim judaism i i don't really
i i as a one-word i can say i love learning
about it it it its history
 and it is very powerful history but
 uh i don't know it ' s it ' s hard to say
it a it a it a debate
 i mean take us hours to talk about it 
 hard to say uh 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh ha 
uh do you believe in having one god in the world i mean
 
let ' s put it this way 
uh ha
 
okay i i think i believe in 
i heard this from my friend one time 
uh ha
 
and uh the more i think about it the more i ' m
i am inclined to believe it 
uh ha
 
uh he said he said
he believes that there is one power one
energy 
 uh ha 
yeah
 
whether it ' s god or whether it ' s uh
anything 
uhm i believe that there is there is power whatever 
 or energy
 but i do not believe that it needs to be
worshiped 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
uh ha alright 
 
 does it make sense 
well yeah
 
but you were you were religious
you are catholic 
yeah that ' s right
 so my point of view is different because uhm
well i i ' ve been raise as uhm as a as catholic since birth
 
and my father is a catholic so
well i would say that there is a god i mean
yeah come and see everything
and uhm i ' m really really dedicate to my religion 
 though some time i would not go to the church that ' s
bad
that ' s really bad
catholic catholic 
 
 okay 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 that ' s catholic several words
 
that ' s bad
 
uhm uh i think the the problem that i get is that
the word god and the perception that i ' ve
 got it sounds too masculine 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
oh yeah
 
does it does it does it appeal you that it sound very masculine
well it is
do do you know the problem is that uhm
in the past usually the people tut 
i ' m i would say man have no more knowledge than woman
 
i i don't know that 
and uh women usually just stick to housework and whatever
 
and then in the bible it was say that uhm tut 
well uh woman should not preach and woman should not talk
about something related to religion in th in the in the initial part
but later on you actually you woulds you would find
some traces
i mean you would say find find something concerning woman
woman ' s role in catholic i mean in christianity and so on
and uh actually uhm what they fear is
i mean woman will say some her garbage in
front of the public
uh which would not be good to be religion
and that ' s why they did not play an important role in 
 two-words, etc 
 
 yeah 
 one-word 
 what you get in bible 
well in the past yes
but it ' s improving i would say
it ' s improving and you would see in the later part of the uh
bible
woman really play an important role and 
preaching and whatever
 i mean it ' s improve 
you know while you you can say that it ' s kind of masculine
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
it is really masculine isn't it
 uhm i don't doubt this so
i mean i i ' m sure jesus i mean or the buddha 
very very gather which was i mean uh
i think there ' s a religion i don't several words
someone called uh several words or
something like that
 i think it ' s a fairly new religion from 
 somewhere in u n 
and i think it talks about how every religion 
 supposed to be in the same thing 
 yeah 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
uh ha yeah
 oh 
 
 the god 
if there ' s is a god 
yeah
 
okay uhm put mohammed in just say arabian
 jesus christ the same area and buddha in 
 two- words or whatever whatever religious
 leaders in specific area and at specific time
to teach those people 
at that time and that that place you know you
know language in in ideology
uh they would understand that those people would understand
 it ' s supposed to be the same thing 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 that ' s right 
 uh ha ha ha ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uhm uhm 
that ' s right
they think that uh i think the god is just just in different
forms
i mean but it ' s actually one
 
yeah 
 i think 
 
 well 
you know you know i really didn't give too much thought
about religion
until uh until that is very funny i get into
astronomy club okay in university
and the the ideas i mean
when you move back from earth 
 uh ha 
 uh 
uh ha
 
i don't know how many light years or how many
 miles or thousand hundred and hundred and thousand of
miles away 
uhm it ' s near solar system 
okay 
 right 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
uhm uhm
 
world is there
nine planets two-words, etc all
planets sun 
 yeah 
uh ha
 
and then if you move further back 
yeah
 
alright
what do you see
you start seeing two-words 
uh ha
 
at that point you may not even be able to see the sun
 the one-word itself has 
millions of stars okay
you move further away 
 uh ha 
 yeah 
uhm uhm
 
you see cluster of galaxy 
within there is the one-word 
 uh ha 
yeah
 
okay
cluster of galaxy has maybe thousand of galaxy 
 within cluster of galaxy
maybe you move away you have super cluster of galaxy
you can actually see uh spot about hundred galaxy
i mean specific area uh areas in the universe
and there another specific area
 and the the thought i try to get is
what makes i believe him 
 yeah 
 uh ha ha 
 uh ha 
 uh 
uhm uhm
 
i i our planet explain for something that ' s
just so enormous
i mean human is what not not even exist if 
you move out far away maybe 
you can't see the one-word uh
 at distance
you can't see earth 
so what makes the people explain
i mean it just seems too easy to explain there is a god
because we are here 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 yeah right 
 yeah 
 uh ha 
uhm uhm
but you think this answer
i mean this question can never been an answered by anyone
so it ' s not worth of thinking
 
no no no
not at all
i i i don't doubt religion has uhm uh 
i mean i would never argue it and it say that it does not 
push good vales
 i mean every religion does 
 uhm uhm 
yeah
 
okay uhm that ' s it
i ' m sure everyone was extremely religious 
yeah
 
to to uh hundred percent and follow whatever
you call it bible whatever 
 uhm uhm 
uh ha
 
uh uh everyone
there will be peace but that ' s not the case
uhm religion is a good thing but it just certain
things that i just can't i can't really one-word 
 uhm uhm 
uh ha
 
it ' s a lot of time i know i know somewhere down line in your
live
you have no faith 
somewhere down in road you got to have to know the truth
you have to face it believe yourself and
but i ' m the that a person that one-word
 give me some prove 
 yeah 
 yeah 
uhm uhm yeah 
 
 alright 
i ' m i ' m not type of person two-words
 
 well yeah that that ' s that ' s normal i mean
you come from university
you you won't you would not just listen to somebody and 
then you just believe that 
 
 yeah 
 well it ' s sort of one-word 
a lot scientists you know 
yeah
 
i live in several words reli
 religion too
 doesn't mean uh i don't know it ' s so it ' s so
interest topic
you like talking religion 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
well sometimes yeah well
sometimes i do talk about to my friends as well 
but uhm well i would say uh i talk about that
i mean earlier i mean in maybe three or four years
 ago 
yeah
but not now
 i mean not too often
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 ago 
 yeah 
yeah 
no
 
i love to talk 
uhm uhm
 
generally i like i mean i got to learn some more when you telling
me about why god is masculine 
uhm uhm
 
i don't have
i don't doubt that somewhere like in the past you know 
 several words 
uh or i mean do you believe in two-words 
 uh ha uhm uhm 
 yeah yeah 
 
 two-words, etc it ' s 
you do 
yeah i do
 
why do you believe in that 
 why not
 
because you know where is the two-words 
that 
uhm uhm
 
that the bible or cause there ' s more two-words
 wish 
oh
 
i mean why it
have we found the missing lake
 no we haven't 
 i don't think so
 
why can we find that 
uhm uhm
 
i mean we are talking about the spend of hundreds 
 uh of thousand uh
i don't know how many thousand of years
 ten thousand maybe even one-word
 talking about
 one-word about uhm
 there was a species from apes to 
man 
how come we can find that
yeah we can the dinosaurs 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
oh
that ' s a good point
actually i i don't know too much about this
 
 yeah it ' s just 
yeah i don't know 
 but i would say well it appears to be reason
but 
 laughs 
yeah
 
good point isn't it 
yeah
 
yeah 
 that ' s right 
 
 i used to believe it actually 
uh ha
but not now
 
well i mean it ' s it ' s it ' s a it ' s a it ' s a very 
 one-word 
yeah
 
uh make sense i mean 
we do look up our like 
 yeah 
that ' s right
 
it ' s 
uh ha
 
uh and uh 
well it just seems as those a lot of horses
 it it doesn't seem very logically we can it 
 uh ha 
well
 
i mean it should should be there
there should be a lot of bones of it
but we can't find them and i don't know why 
 uhm uhm 
but it is it ' s been so many years of take well several
words 
 
oh we
yeah we can find this little fossil of fish 
 uh ha 
uh ha
you know
well that ' s good point
that ' s really a good point
 
uh so you know i have a lot of questions 
uhm uhm 
 
 uhm 
maybe religion is world 
uh ha
 
i ' m supposed si uh find the truth 
uh ha
 
but i had definitely have to talk more about it 
uhm uhm
 
uhm are you buddhist
are you two different someone mean 
 well i would said their teaching are 
good 
but i was stick to catholic
 
 yeah 
yeah i see 
i i was just believe in one god one god
 
 yeah 
or buddhism doesn't doesn't have just 
two-words 
 well actually because because i believe in
 in god 
i mean god in catholic 
and so i won i won't i mean i mean i won't stick to buddha
 or believe in buddha
but i i ' ll respect them
 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 oh 
yeah 
yeah
i think their teachings are are good
 i mean some of them really make
sense
 and really teach you how to do
how to how to be a good person
 
 yeah 
 so 
 yeah 
yeah 
yeah
and have you ever have you ever meet any false religions
i would say some some concern with sex or whatever
 
oh
no i haven't
it sounds interesting 
yeah 
 and
 laugh 
no i haven't 
 well i would say it ' s 
 
 have have you 
no
but i i would i would like to 
 
 you mean kind of cold right you know
 you have to sit in and cold
no i haven't uhm
did you ever come across
i think i did come across some of them
this kind of in this kind of cold 
 yeah that ' s right 
uhm uhm
 
really weird
something uh 
 but i would like to know their original
how how how they
 
how ' s they form where 
i think well maybe
 
let ' s think about religion
you know you have to 
that ' s one thing i don't really 
there ' s just too many uhm religions that are strange 
 from the main uh main stream okay 
uhm oh okay
can can you tell me the difference between uh 
one-word and one-word 
 maybe 
 uh ha 
 main stream main stream yeah that ' s right 
 uhm 
 
 but what what ' s the purpose of uh having this
different sex in christianity 
wow
 
it it it i i know i know one-word that ' s
 one-word 
is it one-word 
actually i really i ' m i ' m not several
words 
 you don't know 
oh okay
i think it ' s comes from england 
uh ha
 
but i ' m i ' m not too sure i have to ware
 about it
there ' s a lot of uh yeah there ' s a lot of uh strange of
 several words one and those who one-word
 whatever
 i just that was just a question i just wonder
 if you know 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
 uh ha 
uhm that ' s cool
okay i think we have talk about so much about uh religion
 let ' s move to uh what else

it ' s real fun game i mean
the feeling of hitting the ball

it just a real funny
i ' ll take it i ' ll take it play with

it ' s a relaxing sports
uhm you could get a lot of exercises when you 
when you walk in around
you carry your own bag 
you could get a lot of exercise 
but you know something like the car travel
