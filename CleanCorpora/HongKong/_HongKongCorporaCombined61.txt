  oh that ' s good so when so when did you leave  uh live in qinghua ching wah  name of a unversity     no when did you leave to go on your trip  you went in summer time   leave   sum summer time   june in june or  june  june nineteen one in the summer   and how long did you stay five weeks and after after that i live in qinghua qinghua university do you know this university you know   i ' ve just no i ' ve just heard of it cos another friend of mine from university came back from there and said that she stayed there so you are like live there during the  during the f four four weeks yes  and uh and also what do you want to know about my trip    the stay   right  what do you like best   in beijing  the best   uhm uhm what did you like what was your most favourite thing about  uhm i think you mean the qi qinghua university or   peking     in in peking  in peking uhm   and she spends little in five weeks and i no i think that the transport is very the transportation network is not good    uh huh  is it not any good no  yeah it ' s no because uh there is always traffic congestion there and also uh uh people always like to push into the bus and to the mtr and is something like that and it also there ' s there are many bicycle on the road and so it lead to traffic congestion or and oh that will be horrible   yeah did did you go to any museums  museum yes i go to sei this cantonese word literally means ' dead', but it is used for expressing embarrassment in this conversation uh i don't know the english name of that museum   aw it ' s okay what ' s the chinese name   gwan sih one-word   gwan sih cantonese=military     and what was  a military it ' s military museum  it ' s     oh  and also i go to uh i have went to sei  this cantonese word literally means ' dead', but it is used for expressing embarrassment in this conversation i have gone to many places   like uh    uh huh  did did see the corpus the cor     to see the what  the corpus of uh chairman mao  corpus of chairman mao  corpus     what ' s that   oh oh oh right  it seems as if uh he is a uhm tut a few words    uhm uhm well he ' s buried where where is he buried he buried in his grave  no no   where is he buried  bury a few words  he ' s not buried but rather in a glass box   aw uh uh aw    in a glass box  you know   right  he ' s lying in a gla uh in the glass in the glass box   yes uh huh   he ' s lying in the glass box uhm i think uh he like uh plastic man plastic   does he look like  the plastic uh does it   i ' ve al i ' ve always doubt where he is chairman mo mao   there ' s really really  and also uh and also everyday i have to learn uh mandarin in in qinghua university   uh uh  and that ' s why h she now speaks fluent mandarin no no i i can't speak uh fluent mandarin because   yes you can that ' s what you have to do you go there for five weeks you learn it real quick   but  but i think it ' s a very uh interesting trip because i can see uhm how the peking people live uh their lifestyle and many other things that i cannot see in hong kong   but was it was much different than hong kong there  yes    it was very different   yes a great different between hong kong and peking   and uhm because i think that they uhm some of the peking people citizens are very rich and some are very poor there ' s a two great difference    yeah  uhm hong kong is the same   yeah but a few words middle class   a few words but their difference is greater  the difference is greater in peking are rich people officials     yeah  either very very rich very very poor not in between  because  between uhm i don't think that theirs is so much between for   example and also uh teaching teaching in uh peking uh is not good because the teachers got a very low salary    right  uhm uhm  and the salary uh is about tut below one thousand per year below one thousand   per year per year uh i can't believe that     below one thousand hong kong  no uhm renminbi   renminbi   renminbi     so what would that be what would that be in hong kong dollars  uh in hong kong dollars is similar it ' s similar the same in hong kong it is like     and this is like a thousand a year  yes   per year z ' s speech overlaps with unidentified speaker ' s speech i wonder how do they live  and sometimes they don't get their salary because the local government do not have the money but it is for the local government and for the uhm for the countryside  and for the city there ' s no there ' s little such a situation but uhm uh for my teacher he taughting me mandarin he ' s a professor in the qinghua university get he got uh about seven to eight sorry  se seven hundred to eight hundred uh yuan  renminbi per year he ' s a professor  he ' s a profess     uhm uhm   remin   per year   per year per year   very low  yeah we ' d uh and also he always says that uh he do not have much money much money to uhm tut to go to some shopping centre that uh sell uh necessary goods  we have   what can he buy he can buy nothing we had got to uh yansha shopping centre   uhm uhm  there ' s uh buy many uhm many imported imported imported goods and for us uh it ' s not so much expenses but he says that he had never gone to that uh shopping centre because it ' s the things there the good there are very expensive he cannot afford t to he cannot afford to buy them yeah   so like so than it will be more expensive than here in hong kong uhm it ' s nearly the same but he say uh he have do not have much money     cos he didn't have the money  yeah and also he has a he is a professor and his house we had gone to his uh house his house is smaller than this than this house than this house uhm not room not exactly room but uhm what should i say  ngh gei dak j the phrase means she has forgotten what she wants to say   room  is is his  uh  is not is not his  h uh is qinghua university a flat offer by the university     oh it ' s offer by the university housing  yeah yeah but it ' s smaller than this one   do they have family  yeah he has a family but uh his uh his wife is a reporter is a reporter and he ' s she has sh he has a he has a daughter   uhm uhm  she is uhm ten years old   so his wife is a reporter for the newspaper  uh uh i don't think it ' s the newspaper it ' s the tv but she is reporting the tut something cultural about cultural uh news or some health news but not uh that is related to political news that that uh    uhm uhm  that ' s why she can survive yeah you know if uh she is reporting poli political news uhm tut i think is impossible for her to do so   yeah we think so they must i mean they must check everything that that that goes on television and goes in for the newspaper  yeah he and also he ' s got uh he ' s he come to hong kong last year he come to hong kong about december last year and he ' s coming to baptist college uh to teach mandarin   oh he ' s leaving china he ' s going to leave china he ' s he ' s leaving  he ' s leaving no no no     china let him to come here to live  no no uh he just come here     temporary temp just temporary  just a for short time   yeah yeah so   yolanda what are you studying in in what are you studying in uh  in college   baptist college  i ' m studying china study  china study uh the option is sociology    s  uhm uhm  sociology i ' m studying s something about uh about uh soci  the social situation of china and also uhm and also karl marx max weber and something like that   so will you teach like eva or you going to to work  uh i don't know what i can do after i graduate uhm because i do not have the major i i am sociology major but in most secondary school uh there are no sociology subjects for me to teach and     uhm uhm   yeah that ' s discrimination yeah that ' s discrimination because i ' m graduating from uh universi it ' s not  discrimination  university it ' s going to be a university this year  uhm but but it ' s     but it would be a same degree whether it ' s a college or a   it ' s the same   yeah but it is a few words  discrimination  it is the same degree  it ' s a discrimination because many people think that uh those graduate from baptist college is uhm their performance will be poor  will poor than the students of uh hong kong university they will think that so uhm for many large firms and large company they will not employ a student of baptist college because uhm they   yeah     that does not seem fair this is discrimination   this not this not fair i know    but when will get your degree when you get   your when you finish it you ' ll still have it a  regular certified degree   i ' m against discrimination   yah   uh   yes   yeah i ' ll have a degree   you have it from the college not university    right just like we ' ll have it from hong kong university  well and the government participates in the discrimination   what in what way  uhm like uhm the five grades the government grades executive officers administrative officer uhm if if you come from the college or the polytechnics uhm you may not have the chance of being interviewed and even if you if you have the chance to be interviewed they still think that you are not as good as the university students  yeah that ' s true that ' s true   oh that ' s wrong that is just bad how big is how many students at baptist college   discrimination  how many student the total st     yeah very big  uh around over one thousand   so it ' s small i compared to here  not one thousand i ' m not su quite sure about that   for hong kong university how many are there nine thousand student yeah several thousands uh i think it ' s about three thousands three thousands   what do they teach in they teach in english  they don't teach in english that ' s the point you ' re right yeah uh some course some teacher uh teach in english but some teach in chinese and many teach in chinese can not chinese cantonese it ' s cantonese  for example and i ' m studying many subjects and course but many of them teach us in cantonese but the examination the examination is    uh right   uhm is it a few words written   examination so written examination is in english    exam  that ' s bad than because you have no time to practice your   english   right uh sometimes they can present in cantonese while the lecturer is a foreigner    yeah  yeah well you can see the difference between  she and me unless she can she can be speak fluent english but my english is full of mistakes  unbelievable   no  no no   oh i don't think it is as bad as she think i mean you are very understandable  in the conversation i understand everything you are saying   uhm uhm  yeah because uh very simple english very very simple   but english can be simple and can be very difficult but here would be good yeah here is good this university because you because you can practice and can you have a foreigner to a  yeah she ' s a she ' s a ameri american she ' s a american and she ' s right she ' s uh she ' s come to hong kong for tut about over ten years over ten years and she ' s teaching us sociology in baptist college    a presentation   and you    does she know any cantonese at all  she not she know cantonese     uhm   but then they can they can present in cantonese  yes and also uh she know mandarin also how about you uh   how about you  well how how many years have you come to hong kong   three years  three   three and a half years but every summer i ' ve been here for every summer i wanted to stay here and study cantonese during the summer and every summer i i ' m always had to go back to united states  to study english   to visit my children so i never have the chance this summer i ' m i ' m going to go back as well  but but i think cantonese is is a very complicated language and it ' s difficult to learn     it is difficult it is difficult cos eva tries  helping me with things and we ' re trying   as help   the most im the important of that cantonese is useless it ' s useless it ' s a not a international language uhm so uhm if you although we can although we can speak fluent uh cantonese it ' s not helpful  uhm    so instead that you learn mandarin  yeah you still have to speak in putonghua when you are in peking who ' s going to understand if you speak in cantonese    yeah  see if i was going to be here if i knew uhm i would here for long time when we first arrived in hong kong we were only supposed to be here for two years so i though that for two years it was too short of time to try to learn a language after  the two years then we found out we are going to be here another two years and now is another two years so all total we all have been here six years   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   another two years  six years so when will you leave   well after five and a half two more years we ' ll be here   uh before  yeah two more years in hong kong   yeah before ninety-seven cos i ' ll yeah and when i finish my mphil then i will leave  do you do you plan to visit china now  visit ch     i hope to yeah i haven't a chance to  but i think uh you better not to visit the the guangdong  gwong dung cantonese=guangdong canton canton province province   we should not visit or we should  you should not   no how come  because uhm i don't think there is much for you to see   all right then visit   i think uh peking is better because at least it ' s the capital of china so it can have uh more things to see  yes    did you fly there when you went  i fly there i fly there because \ uh     how many hours flight  three three hours   oh that ' s not bad   because   but if you go by train there are many many of friend go by train went by train uh went by train they have to uh travel thirty six thirty six hours   thirty-six thirty-six hours in train     long time that will be long time for tour  and the and the condition in the in the in the train is very bad  one-word    is it  yeah because uhm many uh many canton people and many uh many china people many chinese they uhm they run to the to the uh train even they do not buy the fares  tickets   uhm uhm yeah  do not buy the tickets    but  how do they get on  they no one cares yah and they will run th they will run through the window yeah so through the window they can go inside the train    uhm   aw  really yes   and nobody tries to tell him to leave   uh     they just  my friend has tried to tell them to leave but uh they just sit in your sit in your bed or sit on your bed and then sleep on your bed so how can you uh even if you if you ' re girl how can you uh make them to go away you cannot do that   no it ' ll be difficult  it ' s difficult because they are strong uh uh i heard that uhm if you like say uhm after you had your lunch box and someone through through the loudspeaker and tell you just thrown your lunch box outside the window throw them out so that so that the train will be clean  yeah    oh it ' s terrible it ' s terrible if they throw them out of the train and and the landscape and then outside is all dirty   yeah   yeah boxes on the fields rubber boxes on the field     oh that ' s terrible  yes and chinese people is like that and that is china that ' s china yes   oh that is terrible it ' s terrible because i know when we walk we we walked saturday  we went to sai kung and even there though uhm uh people sometime they just take their bags and they have the lunches and then they just leave them  uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh  yeah chinese love littering it ' s true     it ' s bad because you know it ' s just so bad for the environment  yes and also i ' m against that uhm uhm the ch the hong kong government plan to allow uh one thousand one thousand uh  chinese one thousand chinese to come to hong kong  i ' m against this they are professional they come to hong kong because uh it ' s said that it ' s said that uh there ' s many vacancy  chinese   aw uhm  yeah uh i don't think so there are not enough professional in hong kong so we need them but i don't think so and they say the fresh graduates uhm the local fresh graduates don't have the experience and that ' s why we need we need to import someone from china   so then in what fields are you talking about   uhm     what fields of study  no they they come to work as management as the trainees or managers    are they professional that   as managers in business  in the business management  yeah   so why would they not take oh because of experience they feel that the hong kong people don't have the experience and chinese do    right and they say say they they have lot of experience and they know more about china than we do but they know they do not know much about hong kong  right     right right so you ' re against it because it take your jobs away from hong kong   right one thousand people   one thousand  one thousand great deal of people   that ' s a lot of people   yeah   right    that ' s a lot so what is going to happen  this this year this year   the are importing them this year  yeah it ' s in may  this year   may   this year this summer this may   where did you was this on the news where did you get this  well it ' s it was said by the financial secretary   yeah we didn't hear it on the night news i didn't hear it well i didn't hear it and may be they had it   and and and  </{ there ' s a in few months ago there ' s a uhm legislative councillor come to my school uh to give a speak lauh waih hing  a legislative councillor ms lau wing hing emily and ms  lauh waih hing i don't know her english name  huh  emily lau emily lau   uhm uhm  do you know do you know her     yeah she appears on television a lot  yeah   yeah   yeah she ' s a she came to my school uh s  to give a speech and some students ask why the hong kong government allowed eleven uh one thousand chinese to come to hong kong they sh uh she say that she do just uh she does not feel there ' s a problem with it she says it ' s okay because uh one thousand is not so much a large number and also and al   yeah she ' s famous   uhm   what about two thousand no  and also uh to sa she says that the most important problem is that uh why do h china why does china cannot uhm cannot make this people to sta to stay in china why do why does china allow them to come to hong kong  is china problem china has problem because she cannot uh make this people to stay in china and she say she say this is the main problem and they work and uh they come to hong kong is not a problem    uhm uhm  but it is a problem because they ' re the they ' re coming here to take away your jobs  yes   so it ' s a problem   yeah i think hong kong creates the problem and china has already got this problem     but hong kong is accepting it  right because they might have the problem as if right so it is a problem for hong kong   because hong kong invites them   yeah  yes   but she doesn't see it she feels it it is a small amount of people a few words   she she say that it ' s a small number of people and she say that it ' s the china ' s problem it ' s not hong kong problem yeah you see uh there ' s there ' re three companies three companies which are going to manage the the policy    that doesn't make any sense  uhm uhm  the companies are making lot of money yeah i ' m very disappointed   no these are companies out of hong these are chinese companies   uh huh  yeah chinese companies in china are     they are going to do it   yeah  they are going to carrying out the     and who ' s going to handle it here on this end  i don't know   so they ' ll just place these people right from china they ' ll place them into the jobs  uhm the local employers if they think there ' s there ' re    vacancies  yeah they ' ll just tell the there companies who are in charge of the policy and to offer them some people but you see see a three companies are definitely are making a lot of money you have to bri bride the officials in order to get get a vacancy you know a chance to come to hong kong <{1 after seven years you become hong kong citizen and you get married and then you ' ll have a lot of children all become hong kong citizens   <[1 uhm uhm </[1 </{1  yeah  right so the people multiply the population keep on multiplying   good point multiplying effect   it ' s multiplying effect   yes yes abso definitely so  they have to pay paying it to the people in the company to get the chance to come to hong kong so three companies making money where more     yeah   yeah   yeah i ' m quite i ' m quite disappointed with her emily lau because uh we select her i mean she is selected by the public    i think that she should speak for us not for the chinese government    you ' re right   uhm uhm
