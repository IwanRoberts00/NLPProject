really
uhm uh 
 oh we are lucky
yeah we are lucky
oh oh yeah by the way what courses are you taking this
semester
well uh i took three geography courses 
 uh uh uh what are they 
and uh one po politic course and then uh because i
failed the science and technology that course uh
uhm uhm
 one-word in mid-term and i need
to retake it and that ' s all
 uh 
 o of course the the chinese course uh
it ' s compulsory
yeah yeah i too have that one as well
well what geography course are you taking
physical or uh or what
 environmental 
 uh 
well uh one physical uh in fact not uh really physical but but the
course is some some kind of uh resources and conservation
uh huh
uhm some kind of mana managing managing resources
course and
uh huh
another is uh the the urban geography course
uhm uhm
and and the other one is uh mapping
use the geographical information system to draw the maps uh that
sort of things
do you like it
well i don't really like but uh is a is an easy course
easy to get pa 
 are you sure is easy
did you go back to ask miss chan about it
i ' ll see that uhm
or ask miss pang for urban geography 
 wh 
 oh yeah yeah yeah she ' s 
 should ask a crappy teacher
i can't believe you ' re taking geography
i thought we comprised that we shouldn't take any subjects we
studied in high school
that ' s really stupid study geography
but that is is really easy
are you going to major in it
oh sure of course
are you going to major in geography
so what what what choice do i have
are you kidding
 oh my god 
 you study english
uh f for f uh uh all that that french
and linguistic all i i screwed up
are are you still taking french
no not not this semester only 
 you ditch it
uh yeah
why
 you don't like it
 because 
i didn't make it good in the first semester
uh we ' re same because kerry and ashley got a uh a d
d
d plus
yeah and they ' re they ' re suggested to ditch the uh the f 
uh french for the second semester
but they didn't
so they have to work hard this semester
oh oh it ' s very difficult to to study
french yeah 
 one-word if if the the
fundamental knowledge is not good enough
yeah they did pretty bad because they always ditched the class
like i did
we ditched the class altogether
we skipped all classes
and then they got a d plus i got a c plus for german but it
was already the worst in my class
i got a i got a c plus and you know what
in this semester we got twenty eight classes but i skipped nine
hours so i skipped like one third of classes
i even got official letter from my department that i skipped too
many classes
i failed like uhm we got average marks for our test
i got an f
and then my homework i got five homework i only hand in two
uh
and i yah i got a letter that i shouldn't ditch anymore class
or i ' ll i ' ll be warned of it uh uh by the the faculty
that really horrible
did they did they advise you not to not to study further uh or
uh or suspend you
yah that ' s why because if i fail because this german course
takes up twelve credits and if i fail i ' m gonna be scr really
screwed
yah i i have to get suspended but you know uhm the faculty
department said there ' s never anyone uh g repeat year one in ba
no a a new one
no i ' m not going to do it because if i fail it they ' ll give
me uh another exam
uh huh
a new uh uh a re-exam for me but i don't like to take it so i
have better work hard
it ' s really shit
i just couldn't imagine how how you can skip so many class
so what what will you do uh uh when you skip class classes
uhm well anything like uh go shopping karaoke sometimes just
sit there doing nothing
just feel like don't want to go to class
in the smoking area
yup
and then uhm no last week ours uhm having my arabian dance
performance
so i 
 arabian dance
arabian dance
yeah i ' m talking serious
look i ' ll tell you about this later
we ' ll talk about this
uhm uh i had my performance and i was really tired after that so i
skipped my class
and then on thursday i had to hand in my uh comp lit paper
i didn't do it the night before because i was s so tired
i do it in the morning
i finished it in three hours
two thousand two hundred words
i ' m so clever
then i go for i do it in the library
and so i ditched my class again because i was doing it in the
library
and then yeah the other time was just hanging around doing nothing
just don't feel like going to class uhm
wow
 three words 
hey but at least i got a c plus
 yah 
 i ' m going to pass this semester 
 and you you are very talent in to to
 and i got german friends
they can help me with the homework
oh you you ' re you ' re very smart
yeah i am for sure
you can figure out the remedial measures uh for for skipping
classes
i ' m really screwed in the exam because we have oral we have
listening we have grammar
yeah
and we have uh articles to write
 it ' s really shit
and uh
 yeah of course 
 yah 
i think it ' s very funny to to study the the german
why
because uh it seems that you have to learn some some some
different let uh letters
no uh german is very close to english
 uh 
oh
yeah like we say uh what ' s that for example bank
we spell bank exactly the same
bank where you get the money
yeah
but we pronounce it as bank
bank
yeah bank
and uh vater 
 vater is uh father start with a v
 and how about 
yeah
vater
mother uh middle m o t h e r with m u t h e r
uh no m u t t e r mutter 
what was so so how about the the german word d i e 
die 
is it is it read as die
 die 
 yeah 
 d i e die 
yeah
no
 in german d i e is die 
 die is uh equal to the
 no 
oh
because uh like in french the the we have is uhm uh we have
divided them into masculine feminine and neutral
oh so 
 so die is for the lady
for feminine objects
is it very difficult to read the german
uhm not really because we ' re really close to english
but i and see s so s so many german words
like like to use the the so so sophisticate
yeah yeah yah really long words but if you can divide them it ' s
easy
really
yah like uhm what they call it uhm
always well always has has this sound 
one-word 
 the r sound yeah one word 
like signing
no the worst word in uh german is that when you say sorry in
english you say sorry right
yeah
really nice but in german we say entschuldigung
it ' s sound really really rude
 is a 
 would you please repeat it
 entschuldigung 
so long
 entschuldigung uh 
entschuldigung sie or entschuldigung bitte 
 bitte 
 bitte is please
oh
you know there is a very funny word that uh you know uhm in
german we say thank you is danke 
yeah
 danke so you say danke sch&oumlaut;n
 that sch&oumlaut;n it means uh beautiful so 
danke sch&oumlaut;n means a very sort of uh no no no no no very thank you
sort of like thank you very much
oh
okay but uhm danke in french means dick
dick
so if we put french and german together that will be dick
beautiful
dick beautiful
yah
what ' s the what ' s the word dick refer to
dick
the dick men have
the d oh the organ
yeah it ' s really funny because we didn't know it until uh
there ' s a french girl sitting with us just fucking around
she told us about it
 oh 
oh
yeah
so good uh
i can see you memorise so many german word
i i studied the french for for a whole semester and i all i can
remember is bonjour 
 bonjour 
yeah *
 &ccedilla;a va 
uh
 &ccedilla;a va is how are you
uh yeah yeah yeah
 &ccedilla;a va 
hey i know better than you
you shit
i even i even forget this word
and merci 
huh
 merci thank you merci
oh yeah merci 
i i know better than you
you are pathetic
these three single word i i i wasn't 
 you ' ve studied french for a whole semester
yah
that ' s really pathetic
but anyway this semester i ' m taking fine arts western art history
i ' m taking a european study course but i tell you this is really
crap
yeah like history course
it ' s worse than history
worst than history
 it ' s about 
european union
oh
can anything be worst than that
i thought it will be something about european culture right
uh it ' s the course called introduction to european studies
so it ' s supposed to be something about european culture
something simpler right
 yeah 
 but we ' re studying the enlargement of european
union
the formation of united states of europe
oh
and uh the political uh and uh military and economic issues
in the european union
oh nice
you you can have a better understanding of the the europe
yeah we ' re talking about the war on iraq now
oh
it ' s really horrible
and the other one is even more horrible
the disney course
it sounds interesting right
disney and globalisation but it really sucks
how sucks
it was uhm it criticises that disney
criticise disney
yeah
it always criticising disney about uhm its uh products caused
great influence of children and uh the the the political dimension it ' s
carrying
like i just finished my essay last week
it ' s about uhm the political dimension of disney ' s products do
you agree on that
so actually they told us that uhm there was a once a cartoon the
three caballeros made in nineteen forty five was actually uhm a a a
propaganda of the american government to show friendly of americans to latin
america because the whole cartoon is donald duck dancing around in latin
america and chile and peru something like that
and uh snow white amazingly is political as well because
political
yes
snow white
yah because uh uhm snow white is made in
nineteen thirty nine during the great depression and uh the the
the animation is very joyful
snow white stayed in the house cleaning and the seven dwarfs go
out to work
and they are very happy singing the song heigh-ho something like
that right
and then so the movie is supposed to encourage the people to work
hard and they will get through the bad times
 snow whit is a very 
 yeah 
oh just just uhm we look this this type of products in different
angle
yeah exactly
and you know what
they said uh snow white was cleaning the house right
so uhm uh snow white was cleaning the castle when she was still
living in the castle and then she went to the hut of the seven dwarfs
she was cleaning as well
so ac actually they said they carry some sort of message
that uhm uhm the american ' s trying to eliminate the others and try to make
everything around them as white
oh
uh can you think about that in uh no one would think about
that when you ' re watching snow white
 yeah 
of course
and what else
uh pretty woman
did you watch pretty woman
pretty woman
yeah by julia roberts and richard gere
well i heard about this but no 
 you never watch that
anyway we watched that and then uhm it was about cinderella
fairytales structure
what
cinderella fairytale structure
oh
is uh unbelievable that you would think about things like
that
yeah is i think it is so complicated to think 
 it ' s way too critical
that ' s what we always said
yah i think it is radial
 yeah 
 radical critical
yeah
so uh the no but like i think this two-words
 too bad because we talk about this with other business student
and they said as they ' re studying business they ' re only taught
about the theories and uh stuff that they don't need to think about it
oh
but we ' re studying ba and then we ' re doing papers and stuff
we have arguments for that
 oh i see 
 and it makes us critical to think
oh because uh it can help us to develop their critical mind
yeah exactly
so i i think it ' s my luck that i got into ba
oh
because i start think about things instead of if i go into
social science i don't know what what what i ' ll intend to be
oh
i don't know
that ' s pretty nice
but ba is free
have so many free lesson
yeah and then ba is crap when we graduate
honestly what are we going to do after we graduate from ba
teacher
are you serious
yah i think you ' re you ' re you ' re a a good
teacher
 do you 
yeah you sure
me
being a good teacher
yeah
no way
i used to
you want to be a good teacher
yeah i will if if i want
what what like are you going to teach geography
yeah
be another miss pang or miss chan
yeah i i i have a a geography dream
are you sure
yah i like miss chan
oh my god
no you ' re not going to be teacher mr chan
i ' m not sure
i can't believe this
i ' m not sure i ' ll i ' ll think about it on only uh
after i graduate
but like may be you study geography is more useful because
you can work on the like environmental conservation and uhm protection and
management stuff right
yeah and and mapping
yeah it ' s much better than what i ' m studying
i i ' m sure about it
you you can think about taking geography courses
i don't know
really funny
no no no no no no i don't think so
 n no demanding
but i like my courses better
don't you don't have mid-term and papers
 do you have mid-term papers 
 no 
 yeah but no tutorial no test
really
only exam and term paper
oh my god
 two-words you you you should think about
taking geography courses it ' s it ' s really not harsh
but i don't think it helps if uh that you you don't have
tutoring because uh tutorial because tutorial really helps
like a group of people we talk about our points
we talk about our point of view and everything it helps with our
paper
well but no nothing worth talking in geography 
 because most most of most of them are are the
 are the facts
 oh yeah really 
 yeah 
 i know 
are theories and facts
yah
uhm i don't know i ' m not really interested in geography
anymore
oh shit
i really hate it after the a-level
i have enough of it
the christaller theory
come on it ' s it ' s really ea easy
hey but it ' s not challenging is it 
 you think it it is it is uh it it made you a
headache but i think it ' s only because of the teacher
like miss pang
no but the problem is if it is easy then why am i taking the
course
i ' m going to university to learn something
oh come on 
 to gain a knowledge
i ' m serious
if i ' m going to university and take something that i i did in
high school it doesn't help it
it ' s too easy for me
then why am i taking the course
i ' m taking some new courses
yes it ' s demanding it ' s harsh it ' s stupid it ' s critical but i
learn from it
i learn how people look at disney
i learn how people look at european
but why do you skip courses
uhm
but why you just skip courses 
 yeah i skip all lectures honestly
i have ten forty classes tomorrow
the european study i ' ve never been to a whole lecture
i only been to like half hour
half hour
for the whole
yah from now uh since this semester starts
oh
and then on tomorrow uh wednesday wednesday morning ten forty

 you can relax when when they p play
the movie
yah you can do anything you want
we can you can bring your popcorn
yeah
yeah honestly really but uhm but i ' ve only been to two

china

 i didn't live in mainland china
i i ' m still on the land of hong kong

yeah
and the and the fine arts classes

oh
and i also skip the chinese classes
hey now we change the lecture for chinese class

he ' s a funny guy right
uh well yeah
