  welcome back our subject is importing foreign labour lee cheuk yan importers argue that importing foreign labour will restore the economy which right now is suffering from mass emigration high wage demand and uh a high staff turnover rate they argue that without the imported labour the whole economy obviously including the workers are were suffer in a long run  but i think basically we have to look at some of the real facts when when employer say that you know hong kong uh is suffering from high wages look at the wages of the workers you know and and when we look at the statistic the real wage index of workers in the garment trade say uh when compare to six years ago it had dropped by twelve percent in the shoe manufacturing sector it had dropped by uh thirty percent and overall the or in whole manufacturing sector it had only increased by four percent of real wage so actually it reflect that uh the the the wages of workers are not really that high and not really pushing the the wage to a limit where the the the investor will leave well that may well be true but uhm you must be aware of the counter argument to that which is if uhm the worker are going to demand more and more wages in hong kong then manufacturers are going to set up their manufacturing facilities across the broader in guangdong provinces in the shenzhen economic zone now uhm yeah this is in addictable   this this is something you have to you know yes even if we uh say freeze the wage for three years or five years the employers will still go because the the manufacturing sector wages and every thing in china is very is comparatively very low and so you can't help it  but i think   except that the infrastructure in china if i may say so is not quite as good as hong kong uh and would not be  for a long long time  yeah that ' s exactly the point  and so we are hong kong has its own attraction for manufacturer and it ' s not the problem with manufacturer in hong kong it ' s not wages and they good uhm they ' re going to china it ' s because they want to have low wages and that so they tolerate the the bad infrastructure but because of good infrastructure we can keep the employers in hong kong so the problem with the hong kong manufacturer now is other problem you know   so you are saying wages is not an issue with the manufacturers but it ' s wages an issue with the workers i mean would they go away if they are not going to get a ten fifteen percent increase every year they cannot go so would that ' s what happen in the   they they can certainly join the uhm the the hawkers in the street or they can set up their own businesses and so on leave the manufacturing to somebody else they can change profession is what i ' m saying   yes it ' s net not that easy i think the basic problem now is in the service industry uh the the workers in the manufactory cannot move to the service industry where there are more work available why because there are no training for them so what we are saying in uh in the labour movement is that how to solve the pay problem of labour shortage in the service industry is by training workers in the manufacturing to move forward to the service industry and you don't have to import labour because in the manufacturing there are surplus labour and in the service industry there are shortage labour   and you put that point to the hong kong government and what has the hong kong government said in in answer to that i think uh the hong kong government had always has a policy of uh non intervention and they don't don't want to go into training i think that ' s the basic problem that the way to solve the problem is uh for us is to retraining but for the hong kong government is to import of labour and this actually in in contradiction to what the hong kong governor say in in two years ago i remember two years ago they he said very clearly that any import labour would not be uh consider because it would uh affected the workers for uh share of the prosperity of hong kong well but can you   but nowadays it ' s very inconsistent can you seriously argue that the import of say fifteen thousand workers uh into a city which has got close to one million  people working in industries can you seriously say that that would have immaterial effect on on the wages levels yes of because in hong kong the basic uh difference of hong kong and other societies is that here in hong kong every thing is supply and demand  you we don't have collective bargaining we don't have any wage broad to set the wage of the workers every thing is according to the rule of supply and demand so imagine supplying more workers into a se sector it for sure would affect the the whole uh wage uh setting  si  and for and uh it also it affect also the workers ' demand for better wages or at least wages to cover the inflation because uh when when you ask for more wages the employers will say okay we will import more labour next year then that would be always a problem for workers to have im  have an improvement in their wage level   as uh more people now effected have been the democracy movement and and the new china news agency had become an airline have sort uh by suggesting what telling the government to they took a stand and came up advise the government what they should the government should be negotiating with uh a union movement to uh settle this dispute just a case of politics uh making straight bad fellows  yeah of course we are in this issue we are glad that the new china news agency make a statement but of course it ' s very obvious it ' s political motivated because if they had supplemented by saying because they don't want the liberal so called liberal to manipulate this issue into election  issue so they do the right thing but with the wrong motive you can say but uh but i think if they are really serious about you know uh keeping uh the workforce in hong kong happy they should know have a policy that china will not export labour then for sure this will have a a very good in influence on the hong kong workers because uh the fifteen uh thousand quota many of them will be from china  and perhaps promote somebody internally in ncna for a change   laughs     and pe  okay thank you very much for coming in we ' ll be back with uh martin barrow chairman of the hong kong tourist association    hello jonathan fenby is uh still on holiday at the moment or that just about to come to an end so this is keith kay with our weekly chat programme where we talk to prominent and interesting people about issue facing hong kong today  that ' s my pleasure to welcome audrey eu who ' s chairman of the  bar association and uh perhaps therefore a frontline and the battle to preserve the rule of law in hong kong and ensure that we do retain the present legal system here for at least uh the next fifty years welcome to the programme  press read this first of all talk about some of the issues that uhm the bar association is facing what would you say is your prime concern at the moment  well i have a number of prime concern all speakers laugh it ' s not particularly good year i think good fortune well uhm i think first of all we of course have the provisional legislature which has been concern for the bar for quite some time uh we recently had the consultation paper on uh social uh the society ordinance and public one-word ordiance we recently have in in news read about the proposal uh that will be made uh for the children in the prc who would after first of july have the right to abode uh in hong kong and then i think on a sort of internal aspect as far profession concern we also face with problem such as uh the uh use of chinese in a sense of development of bilingualism uh we have alls always have problems about uh number of people joining the profession and question of standard in in the profession and so on   so you ' ve got a busy year haven't you one-word    busy year yes   let ' s pick up on the the the the recent proposal of the changes to the uhm society ordinance and so on that ' s consultation exercise do you think that was a successful consultation exercise  well we don't know the result of the uh of a consultation exercise we know the views had been sending and of course i think uh uh a quite uh a good uh number of uh uh submission four thousand  right  i get that from the papers and and it i mean in that sense of course it ' s successful   you may representation yourself i think  uhm the bar may uh uh uh representation the form of position paper i wrote not call which was published in uh english newspaper   and it seem to be sign of this week that in fact some of the points we ' re getting through that was interview are softening uh uh all all attitude towards those changes  well i think it it is a good sign that uh uh a responsible government having consulted uh and having receiving the views uh would take at least some of the views   uhm of the provisional legislature there is uhm is that uh an ongoing any consultation exercise on that do you think  uhm no it ' s not the question of consultation exercise i mean at the moment we of course have the provisional legislature which is proposing to pass uh laws or to take steps to pass laws which will come into effect on first of july   can so what ' s your main concern there that   well i think there ' re really two aspects to one is the the status of the provisional legislature whether in fact it is in confidential the basic law and in that sense but therefore it has a a solid legal and constitutional bases the other aspect is that it it is taking uh steps uh uh uh  which is part of the legal process in passing laws but whereas in fact  even if they uh aware a a valid legislation the first place uh it ' s quite clear that their pass would only uh be effective from first of july onwards     uhm  uh uh i i think i won't say two-words pass any laws uhm but they are going through uhm stages i think they got through uhm some early stages reading some bills   that ' s right   if they left and actual pass the bill so after the first of july would that satisfy concern  will uhm i think the the the question is is this uh what what what is the au authority where is the associated authority i mean if you say that you are the legislature from the first of july then you command you legislative process from the first of july i mean you you of course can take preparatory steps i mean uh our chief executive doesn't he take a lot of about  preparatory steps the but the the in in the difference between passing laws and and having in uh implementing legal process is that uh what you do  one-word to you having the authority is is not le le  effective   but it ' s not actually what they ' re doing really does he taking preparatory steps now  well there is difference because if you if you take preparatory steps such as uh consulting such as deliberating discussing and and debating i mean this can all be delib uh pre preparatory steps but if you say would part of these steps or these steps in fact are part of the legal process for the passing of laws then the question is will where where is the source of the authority for the passing of these laws   so what would you like to see happen  well we we have actually uh on the problem of the provisional legislature be be be making a number of representation and we ' ve always been saying what we wanted to happen the primary thing of course what we wanted to happen is that  we have a legislature which is constituted in accordance with the basic law and the basic law is very very clear on the on the establishment of our first legislature and first must mean the first one to come into effect  it doesn't depend on what label you attach to you can't say uh because we don't call it the first legislature we call it the provisional legislature and will then it does not have to comply with the provisions and the basic law uh for the first legislature   so should the provisional legislature stop having their meeting in in in shenzhen or they having now  well it it is said there there are really two aspects to it and the the first aspect is something that at the moment are one-word    so it ' s something is not going to become apparent to after the first of july or the problem that it creates  well uhm we we we can see the problems already i mean we we we we have pointed it our that uh the the constitution the establishment of provisional legislature is not in accordance to the basic law   uhm once the once the first won the two-words  all the primes concern then in simply that any law anything that they discuss now any law that they certainly pass now once you once uh anybody uhm is a charge under those laws or they go through the course progress the the challenge was simply be that was unconstitutional  yeah that that is the first problem that that really the the the constitutionality of the body itself   uhm so how your voice that vacuum in the sort of transition uh uh uh if they can't do all that preparatory work after the first of july uh    yeah you you moving on to the second  question     yeah yeah so how do you cure that problem  well in in fact this is sit a problem the the the the bar has been making submission some for quite some time i mean we we say that provisional that you know the the the legislature has to comply with the provision of the basic law a has to be elected b uh the the way the the sixteen members have to be constituted should be in accordance with the method of the formation which is uh you have to have uh thirty people from the functional constituencies ten from the from the indirect elections from election committees and twenty from the geographical constituencies i mean the the provisional legislature simply is not constituted in accordance with that composition   the argument being now the the but this is necessary now the provisional legislature but the other then move into being able to establish  uh the the full proper legislature as under the basic law which they ' re saying what happening year later  well the the the the uh uh decision of the mpc gives the power to the preparatory committee to establish the first legislature  and uh uh uh what what the preparatory committee was doing was not to establish the first legislature but to establish the provisional legislature in in in a way which is not as prescribe in the decision   this is keith kay sitting in for jonathan fenby and our guest this week audrey eu chairman of the hong kong bar association does the lack of the court of final appeal at the moment cause concern as well  uhm it it it won't mean that we properly would have period of time when we don't have a functioning uh a court of final appeal although in name we ' ll have a a court of final appeal because i think the building is there i mean you can see the words which are being carried on and i understand the the hardware will be there but uh it ' s really filling it up with the judges because we are running really really very short of time and we now in may uhm i i get it from the papers i have no inside information but i get it from a paper that we will have the new cj announced some time this month and then you were talking uh about june already and uh whoever the new cj is going to be he would have a lot of work to do to really uhm fill up the judges of the court of final appeal fill up the judges of the court of appeal if they they are promoted then to the court of final appeal and fill up those judges in a high court if they are promoted to the uh court of appeal so uhm it there ' re also the question of uhm inviting foreign judges uh from aboard to come and and sit on a non- permanent bases and and then of course uh you ' ll have to have very clear rules for the profession and for the public uh for faring forms to  timetable and things that sort    uhm  is that essential that the court of final appeal is there on the first of july was there some lead way
