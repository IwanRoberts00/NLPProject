<I>
on the back of them was win win
he done a little bit of work after that ordinary getaway 
in the centre in the pink was king warrior and back behind them
major moves 
now this horse got held up in the straight the horse in the pink cap
it ' s been a pretty good run by him and his best effort on the
sand surface by far
two hundred out though we ' ve got golden apple and new hero 
new hero ' s gone sweeping to the front no money no honey 
running on fairly king warrior down the outside win win and coming
through late major moves for the minor
but getting away near home no money no honey 
nice ride and it scores comfortably by two on the wire with major
moves not a bad effort in third
and don't forget there was a late scratching in that race

lotus of jebwin there on screen is number two currently fifteen to
one
tien caulfield one-word and tai lam combining
 an easy piece of work from him 
single figure quote of ninety-one dollars 
as we take a look now at ho tao emperor 
he ' s opened up favourite at twenty-five dollars 
he ' s with a stablemate there of course free and comfort 
it ' s hotel emperor on the outside of that piece of work
hieden cheung is the rider
and mr dinosaur here a speedy galloper peter lau and louis ho
 and mr dinosaur thirty-six dollars
obviously one of the sources of speed in this particular race
on screen now is number six rainbow rocket 
early favourite now shortening all the time is number eight ho tao
emperor as we welcome to the microphone franko lau
good evening steve and uh on the screen area is number six
rainbow rocket 
uh this horse has raced six starts here in macau and all of
them well beaten and uh just see that figuring in this race uh of course
rambo tse has been off one-word for a while but is
coming back to ride here this evening so all the best to him
yeah nice to see rambo tse back in action 
of course suffered a fall towards the end of last season and has
taken a while to uh get it all together
uh he ' s had a few injuries but nice to see him back in action but
rainbow rocket i don't think will be uh bringing him a winner tonight
he looks class six material
here is mr dinosaur uh a speedy horse 
always deserves top three claims one for sure and certain you must
put in quinellas
you must put in tierces uh seven to two as far as winning the race
fair enough he is one of the main chances in the race
i wouldn't say no about him uh probably also deserves to be uh
around that quote as well so he ' s a definite chance and lightly waited
one hundred and eighteen pounds
mr dinosaur he is a very consistent runner on the sand
his last three runs was a second and two thirds so far 
well uh he has the blinkers removed and tongue tie removed this
evening so uh maybe he can settle a bit behind uh pacemaker in this race so
 he should have a strong chance to win the race and hasn't been winning a
race for a while so uh this could be the night for him
we just some tien caulfield although we ' ll skip now to
number five diamond join
a speedy horse uh hasn't been the strongest so far 
he did draw uh the inside gate over this trip last time
i think one big positive though about diamond join franko was
in a much harder race last time he drops twelve pounds at the weights uh
definitely speedy and weak but i ' ve have to throw him forward the way
this sand is riding as a chance tonight
barrier one 
if he goes hard in front he could just hold on for a little more
tonight
well steve he has speed but weak at the finish as he showed
previously and uh going by the run on twelve hundred metres on the turf in
class four
he has speed and also weakened 
he carried only one hundred and fifteen pounds on that score so
i thought uh not uh to many chances for him this evening
number seven here is uh ball of fire 
he has been disappointing so far 
only two places so far on the turf and maybe he didn't really like
the sand surface
yeah i thought uh the run was slightly better last starting
class four so i think i ' d drop that run down a grade he ' s now in the class
five ranks and uh i think we have to uh i think there uh he just
might start coming to hand there ball of fire
uh barry baldwin prepares danny beasley of course who rode the
previous winner is aboard uh i think we might just start seeing some better
efforts from the horse now particularly on that latest run but he has 
while he run in class four last time he has actually also run in the
class five ranks and been defeated before but i think it ' s the key he
just might be ready uh or starting to come to hand sorry
number four genius guy on screen gets so far back in the race it ' s
always the worry but by far and large uh the best graded horse probably
of the night just in not just in this race 
he ' s the best graded horse of the night genius guy but uh it just
depends on how far back he ' s going to get once again
uh i couldn't give him a chance 
uh obviously the distance will be too short for him
it would not be as worse if a fifteen hundred or sixteen hundred
metre event
i ' d give him a chance uh but not thirteen hundred metres
david brereton doing the riding for the joe murphy uh stable
yeah there ' s going to be a uh day franko he ' s uh just going
to come home and surprise everyone genius guy due to the fact that he ' s
certainly too well graded
one good thing about this uh tonight franko about genius guy i ' m
not a fan of him in the race but if you uh really do like him a couple of
uh good pointers are with diamond join and mr dinosaur in the race 
they are going to fly in front 
uh they are going to go very very quick so if there ' s any i
mean uh obviously that speed just might uh help genius guy if they do do if
they do go too quick tonight
number two lotus of jebwin not entirely dis disgraced
in his first two runs and with naturally improving and dropping a grade 
uh you ' d have to expect uh some better runs from him now
yeah he had a tough run last time over one thousand metres he
was caught wide from the wire on a wide draw 
this time a much better draw for him so i expect him to uh have an
improved run and uh maybe he can run a bit better over thirteen hundred
metres uh this time
number ten here is yantze warrior 
so far he has been disappointing
only uh three three placings on the turf and uh lightly raced on uh
the sand so far
last time was beaten by six lengths over one thousand metres and uh
i thought he was looking for class six
he ' s had a few problems 
sand runs just fair but you do expect him to be uh in uh at
least in some fitness uh after two runs back from a spell tonight 
form lines though aren't really the best but again uh has been
lightly raced and uh with two runs under his belt he could now start
improving
quickly talk about the others 
chiu wah best is number one
disappointing his two sand runs 
he now reaches a more competitive mark but still needs to improve
chris maund is the new rider
again uh probably he is not really a fan of the sand surface
visors on for the first time this evening 
uh he has been placed second over fourteen hundred meters on turf
when he was a griffin
number three tien caulfield shouldn't stay at this mark for
very long showed speed in class four last time 
drop that run down a grade and he can certainly figure tonight
uh perhaps he can a figure in the top three but not the winner
of race for me from barrier ten it would be very awkward for him
and ho tao emperor better effort two runs from a spell uh
his latest he did win in this grade over fifteen hundred metres
yes ho tao emperor he has a chance in this race but heading to the
break back shortly commericial break 
in fact we are now going to go for a replay of the first race
