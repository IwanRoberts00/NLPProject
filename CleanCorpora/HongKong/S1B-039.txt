hello and welcome to this special election day edition of newsline
""
how would the scandals involving gary cheng and the democratic
affect the turnout  and what kind of legislature are we going to get
""
with us to discuss this issue are former legislator allen lee now
reincarnated as a political commentator and professor lau siu kai of the
chinese university
""
welcome  uh allen  uh let me uh begin of you
""
do you feel that the elections this year somehow are are less uh
exciting than uh previous elections that it seems to be much quiet and the
gary cheng uh scandal i think  two-words   suffer 
a bit
""
but otherwise uh this has been a very quiet election campaign 
""
""
well it has been uh uh you know i join the ninety eight
election myself
""
and uh it was much more uh active     and activities
at that time are for  one-word  vote et cetera
""
and i remember on the election day it was very very pouring rain and
people going to the polling   station  you know and and so far i
think there there  ' s less people uh turn out
""
uh i think there are two effect first of all i think uh uh in the
last two years the whole of the legislature performance has been somewhat
disappointing uh in a way uh because people see hey you know we we elected uh
you into office but you haven't done very much for us   uh in the 
first place  
""
secondly   recently is  an of of gary cheng  ' s 
 uh  uh scandal and i think really hurt some people really want to
go to the polling   station  and in fact i was talking to to
some people this morning
""
and they say they don't know who do who they  ' re going to vote for
uh   so they  are not going to vote
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
oh let  ' s  bring  professor uh s k uh
""
uh s k how do you think the uh these various scandals uh involving
uh cheng kai nam and supposedly the democrat
""
how would they affect the uh  uh election result
""
who  ' s go to benefit who  ' s go to loss 
""
""
well basically i think of course uh the dab is going to loss
substantially because of these scandals
""
the democrats surprisingly may only benefit marginally  
 
""
i would say that the all the rest of the candidates and parties are
likely to also benefit to a certain extend from this scandal   but on
 the whole i would say that all are politicians are losers because of
this scandals   because  people had become more cynical  
 of our  politicians
""
and that cynicism might be will be uh one of the factors ringing
down the voting turn out
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
that that good point
""
uh now allen before the gary cheng  ' s scandal emerge uh it was
widely expected that the dab uh will become the largest party in legislature
""
it now appears to that it  ' s not going to be a case 
""
""
yeah well there was a  an  engage  themselves 
feel    of dab  fellows  that  they gone to be the
biggest party
""
they want to  go   through uh  you know not only
that the election committee plus uh uh   the functional 
constituency state uh they go to get uh  uh quite a number of vote and
there was more than  than last time
""
well they may get  one or two vote than last time but they are
they are certainly very difficult to be    the  largest party
in in in legco
""
  secondly  i think the gary cheng uh affair uh 
really hurt dab not only as a pub from public image stand point of view
""
because gary has been  uh posing     as not only
the honest man as the front   man uh  for dab
""
uh you know he looks very presentable and then he lie he lie again
and really uh uh hurt hurt the  one-word    
""
""
and i think uh it  ' s very difficult now even if gary cheng is 
 elected  for him to be a member of   legislature 
""
so what happen in the next four years how could he stood up  uh
stand up uh in legco and making a honest speech and people would believe him
""
  so so  i think it would it  ' s   a
 difficult time for dab    and  certainly it would
be very difficult for them to be the largest party in hong kong
 
""
 uhm uhm yes  
""
 yeah  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uh  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
but s k do you see this as a temporary set back for the dab 
""
""
well look at this certainly
""
i think it  it is a long term set back   because 
uh the dab  will not be able to withdraw  middle class votes in a
years ahead     and most importantly  driven  the lack
of political stars of the dab a party which is suffer from poor image may
have difficulty finding new talent   to join  the party and to
replace the those leaders who are going to retire in the in the years ahead
""
so basically i think this  this scandal is  has a long term
impact on the dab     uh which make it difficult for it to
broaden its social support face
""
they go beyond the traditional leftists and the pro pro-beijing
figures and the i i i think this is  the whole scandal is very sad 
   for for the development of dab
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
and what about the democratic party  ' s scandals uh uh uh are they
going to hurt the democratic party 
""
""
well i think you know there are couple of things in the
democratic party not only with with the recent uh so sad how they  si 
how they use their funds
""
uh uh how they establish their   company to  do so
""
uh a lot of parties outside of hong kong you know that democratic
countries does that   i mean   were  where had their
funds coming from you know
""
uh an evidence i think uh uh  the democratic party face internal
problem of  cohesionless  and of the the own people uh questioning uh
uh the   leaders  whether the democratic part is also become a
small circle   of people  who  ' s running it
""
so i think they are facing  one-word  i think
all parties   in hong  kong now are facing different type of
problems
""
so if you ask anybody today which party even if we have  party
politics   in  election for the chief executive   for
 you  
""
which party leader would would be trusted     and
that would be uh you know a very  one-word  question for
the community to ask
""
uh uh it  ' s not the maturity  uh of of politics
""
i think we  we are having a a a movement towards fully
democratic e elected legislature
""
but i think people uh in hong kong want to see the 
one-word  of   any political  party stands uh stands
up   and  i think so far   uh  democratic
party you know has not been really fill that role either
""
  so  it  ' s been uh disappointing uh   uh
 for the people in hong kong and i i  ' m not  i  ' m not surprise that
that uh there are less people turn out to vote
""
uh in fact uh i think if if uh hong kong development in the future
is towards uh uh maturity type of legislature and the performance of
 one-word  the legislature   uh  is very
 import    for  our future development
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
now s k allen mention that uh we  ' re moving towards a fully uh
elected directly elected legislature
""
and of course one of the things  happening this year is that
the number of directly elected seats has gone from twenty to twenty four and
seat elected by election committee have dropped from ten to six
""
how would this change uh affect uh the various political parties
""
""
""
well i would say that uh uh  basically i think the
democrats may benefit  by the increase of a number of seat whereas the
pro-government forces may find the seat  static     
but basically i think because of the increase uh number of direct elected
seats   it is  always possible for the new legislature  to be
able to produce some ac hoc or occasional majority against government 
 particularly   on social economic and livelihood issues
""
that means  but if you count the twenty four directly elected
 uh members who are basically from the grassroots and then we will be add
a a few functional constituency members then easily there may be as as small
majority  uh or small coalition  in favour of  uh some 
one-word  policies some social welfare some labour policy the
things like that
""
  i would  say that government we would under
tremendous pressure uh or uh in the new  uh  legis  legislature
even though on political issue such as political reform such as attitude
toward beijing  or there might still be a small majority  against 
 uh  the democrats
""
but so we are we are going to see which the  one- word
 situation where  the government will under tremendous pressure
on  uh those  mandate  issues social economic and livelihood 
 but still  pretty safe on political issue
 
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm 
""
""
yeah while while i agree with s k uh on this point and i
think  uh it would be very  diff  for difficult for government now
uh after this selection
""
exceedingly difficult in two thousand and four   i mean
""
""
uh the difficulty is this i take on uh uh a lot of social  uh
uh also you know commute  ty  type of issues
""
uh it  ' s very difficult for the whole legislature of against
something that the people of hong kong would like to see    
""
so it  ' s very difficult of for the government to govern uh from
now on
""
secondly i see the relationship   uh between  the
executive uh and the uh legislature had not been uh established uh in the
last  uh   legislature
""
now  in the new  elected legislature even be e e the
government what even face more difficult time
""
so let me predict c h tung had to change  had to change to
communicate with them   more  directly more effectively
""
the executive council members got to be more effective  
got to  establish this channel communications
""
if they don't i think they  gone  to running into trouble
and and it would be a set back for hong kong
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
do do you see any sign that c h tung is changing    as
understand this   
""
""
 well not yet frankly   not yet okay
""
but he has to think and his his advisors    
""
i think they should and must advise him  that to to really
establish strong communication with the legislature
""
but don't forget they are not only making laws okay and they they
are  voting on all the budgets all the funding     and uh
if you if you look at it the legislature seems very easily now to turn
government down on the funding   requests  okay
""
and if if they continue  with this uh uh uh you know with the
chief executive only go to   legislature three  times a year
alright and with the officials happened to be lobbying and they don't have to
be responsible for their policies and we will continue to see political turn
what  until
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
okay we will continue uh discussing this after the break
""
don't go away we  ' ll be right back  commercial break 
""
welcome back we  ' re discussing the legislative council elections
""
s k one of the problem that hong kong has had is a pretty bad
relationship between the legislature and the executive and part of that is i
guess because of basic law
""
but are are they  also  uh personal factors involved that
is like the uh chief executive uh that that  ' s he make a difference 
""
""
oh i think the personal factor is very important
""
uh i think the basic law  does not  one-word
 c h tung from  trying to cooperate with the legislature but
instead he insists on a narrow definition of an executive lead  
government  and and take an exclusionary approach  towards the
legislature which does not allow the legislature to participate in meaningful
decision making
""
so that kind approach if want to break an oppositionist or or 
structurist    legislature  and that personal factor in the
way of c h tung approach toward the legislature particularly toward the 
uh popularly elected legislators
""
it brings a lot  to poor relationship between the executive and
the legislature in hong kong
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
can uhm can anything be done about this 
""
""
well i think he has to do something
""
i mean it  ' s not much time left for his this term now
""
uh and i think not only the uh the executive council and the
legislature had very poor or none at all of communications
""
uh you could see the exco members uh a lot of all are very afraid
of to speak out on policy in public
""
and some some of the exco members  one-word  or
you know we haven't heard them to say a thing in three years
""
that  ' s to me that  ' s not legco uh that  ' s not exco   okay
""
""
they are policy they decide on policy collectively and
collectively should be responsible for their decision instead   it is
the  officials to goes to uh     the legco   uh
 all the time not being for  boat    playing  the
political   road  yet has no political responsibility
""
so i think that the the problem if if c h tung does not see that
is a problem  then i i think there is   no cure okay
""
he  has to realize it is a   problem   uh
because the the executive branch and the legislature   had  to
work hand in hand   mainly  because at the present moment he
cannot assure himself   of how  many votes he  ' s got in 
 uh in  the legislature
""
you could say all sixty members of the legislature are belong to
the opposition     okay
""
he  ' s got to get the vote
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 yes  
""
now s k  uh the new election that will come the new
legislature that will come into office next month
""
uh do you think that it should take up the issue that have
preoccupied much of hong kong recently like the the hearings on uh robert
chung uh should should they uh hold hearings and also should they uh look
into the gary cheng affair 
""
""
well i think on on gary cheng affair i i agree that the the
legislators should look into the affair very closely but in the case of of
the robert chung affair  i have some reservation because  i would say
that the hong kong people have already had their mind set on on that issue is
to who is right and who is wrong
""
the other thing is that uh i don't very much whether the
legislature can really find the truth on this matter when there are so much
subjective element involved   in the  in that story
""
most importantly from hong kong  ' s  uh stability point of view
   the further  investigation may mean uh even more  uh
hostile executive   legislative  relationship and i  ' m afraid
that there this so called anti-tung pro- tung  confrontation  
will  become even more serious that may   destabilize  hong
kong
""
that  ' s that  ' s why  what i  ' m trying to say is that the less
the  legco  of course has the right and has the reason to further
investigate   but i  simply  and  worry about all the
 one-word  consequences   for hong kong 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
well s k though though you have concern uh similar  amend
 to a lot of people  ' s concern but i i i  one-word 
the new legislature  was that were was work to set up a select committee
to look into the uh robert chung affair uh for the various reason actually
the university senate   didn't  come into any type of conclusion
accepting or rejecting the   report  either it has laid the
responsibility though the two vice-chancellors resign   uh  of
of what why this incident came
""
uh whether uh andrew lo visited     uh to the
vice-chancellor has anything to do uh with with this whole affair
""
and besides and uh uh the report does say that uh andrew lo was a
uh was a very poor and  trueful    witness 
""
so when it says this kind  one-word  the truth
must come out
""
so when   when 
 
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm   so you think uh the new legco uh should hold
  hearings  
""
""
 while   i think now the i think a lot a lot of
new legco a lot of legco   members  are thinking of it now uh
even   during  their campaign they   say  they want
to set up a select   committee 
""
so it it would be very  important  but nevertheless it  ' s a
fact of life that there will be  one-word    now
 as far as uh gary  ' s concern gary cheung is concern
""
and i think he you know he he has suffer a great deal and it and
uh personally i don't think he should be uh uh a legco member because from
now on even if he  ' s selected because of the   system   uh he
would loss totally his effectiveness   as  a member of the
legislature
