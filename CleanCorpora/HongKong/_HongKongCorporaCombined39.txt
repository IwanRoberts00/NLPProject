i i i do different things sometimes i i stare at them and then they ' ll stop sometimes i bang  $a hits the table on the table   transcribers are gonna be torture one word  $a laughs one word torture but   uh and sometimes sometimes i will uh say okay you go on talking i ' m going to get the test paper   uhm  $z laughs gonna just sshh  and there is some time it just ju the the the student si sitting in in front you know say sshh   beca because they they know they know me  they know     uhm are tho are the students in front the ones they ' re usually the better students   or do they sit in order of   it it it differs in in different classrooms   it it really depends on on the way their form teacher would like them to go    uhm uhm  uhm uhm  do you ever relate this to your experience in school like  like when you are teaching do you ever remember when you were a student  i will   i can't i can't remember  no i have once had this crazy idea of you know it ' s my turn to torture students  now that become a teacher  but how did you torture me how did you torture my my fellow  schoolmates i forgotten   and also maybe because i meant i mean because i  i was a very very obedient pupil   so i have i ' ve i have not been tortured and     really   ha ha   yeah   yeah   right   right   right   right and possibly this disci the the kind of discipline area moves that the teacher had to make  we ' re not clear to you because they weren't direct control of you because you were you were better student yeah yeah   yeah   that ' s it that ' s it   so i i i i really don't know but  i mean now that i ' ve i ' ve read so many comments saying that i i ' m so different i ' m quite sure that i i have been doing the wrong things i mean wrong in the sense that you know with that quotes thing   right that scare quotes  what wr wrong because because it ' s not like what everyone else does so they ' re not expecting   yeah yeah   yeah  so it ' s politically incorrect  $a and $z laugh    yeah god  yeah wow yeah i just   that ' s summary what to say  one word  but we but but there there must must be ways to to give them the the right signal i mean i i don't want to be the kind of you know autocrat autocratic teacher you know    just giving out orders and and you have to listen to me because i am the authority i ' m not  i cannot even speak fluent english so i mean     yeah   yeah   right   oh well uh   who several words  $a and $z laugh  you did really is it several words     how   i mean so  now that that some of them had had said that you know you ' re very strange you you speak like a non-chinese but you are a chinese how could you speak like a non-chinese and then and then they and then they go somewhere else and then say  oh nineteen ninety seven is approaching do you think the english is still be so important  i mean they were writing i mean i mean this very student uh was writing under the topic of my new english teacher  something like that  and then go to nineteen ninety seven issue    several words   two words  wow good two words  oh good brilliant well done  $a laughs two words  i guess they expected an a or something and what do you think that they ' re are they playing game and response to like oh you make me do this exercise i ' m going to i ' m going to make a a game out of it and the game will suit me  you know like okay the teacher can can make me do this task that i ' m not use to doing and so in re in response i ' m just going to uhm you know write something   yeah screw up in some way  yeah basically just sort of make it not necessary make mistakes but i will take advantage of the fact that i can say anything   screw it up   several words  #> oh yes they they do they do take advantage of of this because someone had someone had really put down you know like me do put effort in doing this weekly journal and you did nothing you didn't give us any feedback  and then to respond to that i gave them a i i gave this this girl a full page of my feedback for her latest work   i meant i ' m always ready to write i mean i like writing i have this passion in writing  first of all i mean the problem is first i wonder whether they they understand my english  and and second is is really wasting their their own  book i mean i mean their exercise book    yeah   right   right   yeah   right  because you ' re just filling it up   be because i yes  and and it in reply to that this girl said don't worry  you can write what what whatever you want don't don't worry about the space  i have enough space for you  so they just want to get the teacher do something else i mean i mean do something in in accordance i mean    yeah   right   god  you know i ' ve i ' ve heard is that it ' s more important to get the students i i i kind just hear at the university that it ' s actually  in fact it ' s more important to get the students to write and to speak than it is for them to get the feedback of the teacher because it is the action of writing and speaking and trying to make sense out of things  that actually forms the basis of the education it ' s not whoever not the teacher tells them that they had the right answer or that it was good and that was bad because they don't i mean maybe they read the comments but they don't necessarily understand the comments in the way that they ' re   that ' s it  do you think is that true or   oh that ' s they test it  i several words they they they they just  mis misread the comments i mean one of them even put put the comments back on onto their corrections they think is is part of part of the correction   because i mean like maybe i i put a  good at the end and then they put a good  after the end of of their  $a and $z laugh right  $a and $z laugh of their corrections   some something like that several words     right   right   right  $z laughs   right   oh maybe i hear a bad story good  $a and $z laugh  may may maybe i ' ll i ' ll put some two words  symbols like you know oh this is not my my experience is from from my my friend she is only a she is also a teacher and she said she once put a r t meaning article in be in between two two words and this student put that art  $a and $z laugh     uhm  oh god yeah   some something like that would   several words  but but it ' s better than nothing because some of them really care about the the comments  so i mean if they they are not about to to read novels or whatever just read my my cheap stuff i mean  i ' m not writing a a novel here i ' m writing you something i ' ll use words that i feel comfortable with and  there are words that they don't feel comfortable with so they do have to go to check up with dictionary  so in in that sense i mean feedback is positive   and i don't mind doing that especially because i i like writing i mean the only thing is time  i don't have the time to to you know to write a page for every student    yeah   several words   uhm   right   one word   uhm   yeah   right   yeah  how long is school just out of curiosity how long is school every day i i would like is monday to saturday right  monday to friday   monday to friday  and and how many hours a day i mean is it seven or six    yes   from from eight i forgotten actually  $a and $z laugh  from eight to among three   right and then you usually spend some time afterwards disciplining students  $z laughs  but a lot of student   marking   marking marking a lots of marking i   uh my most traumatic experience    uhm tape change to side b    i ' m just going to run it because it ' s better  you know it ' s better to speak two words   because several words   where was where was where was i   we were talking about staying after sc staying after school  and then you said one of my most traumatic experiences and what was that one word   oh yeah yeah   and  oh it is  i i stay at school for twelve hours twelve hours non-stop  because i had i had no recess i had no lunch i  because i every recess some some student will come down and ask me something  i make them to do i make them do that    because i always you know put some see me you know at  at their books you know sometimes i don't understand or their sentences  sometimes i ' m going to see them because of their handwritings i cannot read their handwritings  sometimes because they make the same mistake over and over again i want to see why  so i have no rest so on that very day i work for twelve hours non-stop  i i ' m not sure maybe i have i haven't eaten at all i i ' m i ' m not sure i have i have no no rest for for most of the days i ' ve no break no break  so i mean after school someone will come down to me and and  and give give me the diary and i have to i have to mark it in front of her and she ' ll ask me some questions about about what i ' ve taught because she is a slow learner and i ' m i ' m i ' m more than prepared to to be her  private tutor i mean in some sense because i ' ve been giving her s special attention because of her special case    ah   right   one word   uhm uhm   uhm   right   uhm   god   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  why is this student special case  she is living in fanling  so she has she has to go to to shang wan everyday you know like very early at five i don't know at five  and she has this very peculiar uh habit she has she has to listen to some some uhm gwok  aa aaron kwok song before going to bed  and she insists on going to bed at ten so she had barely any time to to do any revision to read any newspaper you know i ask them to read young post she has no time   one word  okay you ' ve now that now that you ' ve told me all your all your troubles why not give me and give yourself thirty minutes after school right after school you come down everyday so  i ' ll talk with you you know about english not in english but about english for thirty se thirty minutes  so that means this stu student will persistently come down to me at that hour to to cure her   her her her english    wow   yeah   oh yeah   why   yeah   yeah   right   uhm   right right  yeah one word  to give her more of of the the   yeah two words more more exposure actually one word exposure    and also she needs uh to learn more grammar    yeah   one word yeah  so is is this do you think this is working one word how long has she been come in   it it it ' s working it ' s working  she she ' s going to she has picked up some some of the thing i  i told her  i ' m s i mean it ' s like i always use the word   anyway   so anyway they they know how anyway  anyway i mean n now now they they speak anyway  to me you know they speak and they write anyway  in their work  no matter they understand it or not they say  anyway any anywhere  so anyway so it ' s that ' s it is exposure is i have to get them i have to get them to take english as part of their life  so that they won't have to i mean my my goal is you don't have to revise    uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah   yeah  you just go in and do it  you just go into the examination hall and then you do it you don't have you don't have to do any revision  because i ' m several words  i mean i ' ve i ' ve written in in one of the books that you  you haven't ever worry about how to breathe have you    you haven't i mean it ' s part of you you don't have to worry about oh  how should i pose myself to breathe the next breath  i mean you don't  $a laughs do do that    one word   yeah   right   yeah  no although it ' s good not to think about it  $a and $z laugh  what so so it ' s it ' s like that for english    and also it ' s i i i uh wrote i wrote i put down another  analogies like when you are christian you attribute everything to to god  it ' s it ' s like because i ' m so fond of well $a laughs obsess with language learning it doesn't have to be a text book or or an an exercise book a a language book a grammar book  that provoke my thinking  just one sign you know one anything i mean just look at  look at the can you are holding before i mean i mean i mean the coca cola you know  can can i say some brand names    right   oh yeah   uhm uhm   uhm   yeah  yeah  $a laughs  no no brand names no brand names  $a laughs  no i reckon i think coca cola is okay yeah   you know several words  yeah right so you know you just hold that can and look around you know turn around with the can and see all he says e x p what does it mean then you check it up and then you learn another word   what does it mean   expire i guess   oh my ex expiry day   expiration day   yeah   yeah  yeah maybe expiry by you know sep  september ninety-five something like that  so so you ' ll learn you ' ll learn that    yeah   yeah uh  right now wait how what happen with this twelve hour days the student came in twelve hour day and then how was it that you didn't get finished until eight o'clock cos because of marking and stuff  oh marking marking marking   of course of course for for the recesses and lunch hour and and the first hour and a half after after school officially ends ended i i was with the students    yeah   several words   uhm   how long  how many classes do you teach a day  six   six classes a day  six right and   average  average   and uhm how and that ' s everyday of the week  yes and i i     how many students do you have all together    i ' m just curious in   is that   all   all together    yeah  can you count i mean if you have six classes is it forty students in each class or rough   yes yes  for roughly forty yeah   so when you have to do marking if you have one assignment that you ' ve given all six what would you dump because they are different one word   ah of course of course i don't   what you would have to do you know like regularly you would have to do say two hundred and forty assignments every every couple of weeks   a lot a lot a lot  i ' ve more than ten piles sitting you ' ve  $z yawns on top of my my desk   and i can i can i can never clear them  it it ' s usually this is like you know i i give them back one pile i get back four  so you don't have to have a very mathematical mind to figure out that i can never finish all the markings    yeah   yeah   several words   uhm   wow yeah   uhm  yeah like you say one step forward and four steps back  are you always yeah oh god  now   i don't know so it ' s very  it ' s very one word  it ' s it ' s very tiring it ' s   are you still working on your french  yes yes   you are  yes   you ' re taking lessons or  yes i ' m taking lessons   when you just cos it several words   and several words   uh  i well i as i as i ' ve told you earlier i ' m i ' ve i haven't told you the tape but i told you earlier    we we met on monday and then and then we ' ll meet on i mean tomorrow and then we ' ll meet again on friday for both latin and french so i have     right   yeah   right   uhm   so one word twice a week for both or three times a week for both  once a week for latin and three times a week for french  and it ' s just that i sort of have to be there  because i ' m a boy so i i have to be there i i don't know because mi because mrs b always say that it ' s important to have a boy in in a class    right   uhm   why ' s that   yeah  right just sort of have sort of what like to have a like a balance sort of this  yeah i think that ' s fair   yeah yes  so you know i ' ll i ' ll be the two words   every time    yeah  right it ' s useful because because otherwise you end up with a sort of mono-dimensional you end up with a mono-dimensional beautiful language because you ' ve only used it with a particular set of people  so like i speak french all the time but i only speak french to women  $a laughs  i never i never speak french to men i wouldn't dream  $a laughs you know yeah god forbid uhm what is so en en i mean what is your view about latin because you were we were kind of talking about the political status of english and the way students sometimes write things like nineteen ninety seven or something  $a laughs as if that was the date at which all english shall shall end or cease to be relevant  but but like what about latin you what do you   uhm yeah   i  i think i think it ' s very good i ' ve i i was very delighted to to hear that latin is back to to the stage i mean it ' s i mean back to back to school i mean they i ' ve heard in europe they they are now you know making it compulsory again   for especially for the science students  i think it ' s i think of course my my my view will be very loaded because i ' m so obsess with language    yeah   uhm   uhm  what about like are you are you more interested in romance languages than in say germanic languages you know when you speak english it ' s a bit romance language for  you   uhm  yes i like the word romance  $a and $z laugh  actually i i i don't know whether it should say that  say this but i i really don't what what what    yeah
