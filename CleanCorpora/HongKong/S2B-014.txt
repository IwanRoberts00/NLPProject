tough new laws on animal waste disposal is forcing some hong kong
farmers out of business
they say sewage treatment is not only costly but may not be
effective
kam suk ' s family has been farming in the new territories for three
generations
his farm like around two thousand others in hong kong pump out raw
sewage
new laws which came to effect in july means kam suk has to cut the
pollution by about fifty times
the waste treatment equipment will cost him at least eight hundred
thousand dollars speech in cantonese by kam suk 
but the government says they have been especially lenient to the
farmers already
they have three years to bring their farms in line with the law
but industries for example don't get such a long grace period to
comply with similar environmental requirements
 
alternative is they can get a loan or a capital grant from the
government in installing this treatment facility 
the fine is fifty thousand dollars for failure to keep up with the
new standard
kam suk can't afford to pay up should the sewage treatment not work
so for him the only answer is closing down the farm and for
hong kong the beginning of the end of the traditional way of life
