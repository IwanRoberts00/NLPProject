<I>
 
oh how have you been today 
yeah today i have been very fine except
 but i have some uhm quite very heavy workload
today
 
 well 
like what 
uhm because i have to go to my student ' s uhm home 
 to teach her some lessons because she ' s going to have her
exams next week 
 
 uhm 
 uh 
 tutori 
oh well you ' re you do tutoring then 
 you you can call it tutorials
 yeah yeah 
 three words 
 
yeah so you you get money then 
yeah but not very much 
 laughs 
 
oh oh well that ' s too bad 
by the way did you get your cosmetics last weekend 
yeah yes but uhm i ' ve not tried it 
yet
 
 you did 
uhm what did you buy 
uh 
 laughs 
just some lotions
uh 
oh by the way i think it ' s the first time you come to hong kong
yes 
and how do you find how do you find this place
 
yeah it ' s very nice but uhm can you explain me uhm uh
why people works so hard
i mean it seems that that they are working all the time 
you mean students
 
no well students work hard as well but also the uh the people
who who are already in work life 
well i don't think all of us are very 
$a-laughs very uh busy as you think but uhm i think it ' s
 like a tradition more or less like a tradition that we we have to
work hard so that we can get more in hong kong
maybe uhm hong kong is not a welfare state
we have to work hard in order to learn uh earn what we need
 
uhm uhm 
uhm
 
but uhm do you think that because i think that your gdp is
already quite high so uh then do you think that you could have a
little bit more free time 
oh i think it is that is the reason why we have uhm 
quite high gdp because we are busy people and tut well i
don't know
at this i ' m not very busy 
 and
 laugh 
 
well what do you think when you when you start working 
uhm uhm
 
uh will you become like uh people working from early morning
until late evening 
 si 
uh i don't know but if i take up a job like teaching it ' s not
 very it ' s not the job of very high workload
 
uhm uhm 
but if we if i take up a job in the business field i have to
work very hard
and i think that ' s not what i want 
 laughs 
 
you don't want to be uhm being in in business 
no because i i want my own free time
 
uh 
uhm and i ' m not that kind of aggressive people 
 laughs 
i prefer uhm tut a job which can give me some 
leisure time not uhm not that ad uh not
that i i have to worry for many many things for
every day
so i have to take up some tut relatively leisure job
 laughs 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm like teaching 
maybe
 
do you have a long uh summer vacations uhm well if you are
teacher 
 yeah yeah just like the students
 
uh ha like three months in which 
 uh 
 
 onl 
only in the university and tertiary institutions can we
have three months uhm of summer vacation
 
yeah 
for average primary schools and secondary schools it ' s only
 one and a half month
 
uh
uh do you get paid as well 
what
 
do you get paid well
i mean do you get a lot of money 
uh it ' s not a low wage for teachers in hong kong
nearly twenty thousand
 
wow that ' s well that ' s pretty good 
 very good but compared to the successful 
people in the business field it is not uh large sum of
money
 
 uh 
uhm uhm 
well uhm i think that uhm teachers uhm uh wou
 would you like to become a teacher in in primary school or in uhm
what type of school 
well i think it is si secondary school 
uh i like primary school students but i don't
think i can teach them si uhm in a way that to suitable
for them because i don't have the skill to teach very
low forms
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
and so maybe secondary school is more uh more suitable for
me
 
uhm uhm but uh have you seen this one uhm tv programme tv
series where the kids in the school
uh there was a young teacher and then these kids in the school
they were really nasty to him 
uh i think that everybody here watches it
a young guy 
oh leon 
 laughs 
leon lai
 
i don't know but uh are you afraid of that type of 
yes
 yes i ' m afraid of that type of students
uhm that ' s why i i prefer some schools with higher
standard 
 and
 laugh 
 
 two words 
you ' re sure that you 
 makes my life easier
 
so uh uh you ' re sure that you can go to those schools
is it easy to get a teaching job 
uhm for these some years it is not very difficult to
get in secondary schools because many many teachers have uhm
emigrated to other countries 
yes we have brain drains these years
and i don't know
maybe i ' ll try my luck
 
 uhm 
 oh 
well what about you i mean uh about the emigrating
what do how do you feel about it
and what do you like to 
uh i i did not like the idea of emigration some
years ago because maybe i was still very young
i cannot see the problems that may be uhm that maybe
arise from the issue of nineteen ninety-seven but
 uhm these years i ' ve seen tut some intolerable events
that happen in china or the attitude from the
chinese leaders towards hong kong uhm and
so i ' ve just think thinking about emigration
since i don't still don't have the ability to emigrate my parents
do not earn enough in order to have emigration
and they have to depend on me to count on
me
and so that ' s that is not a thing that i need to think about
seriously at the moment
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 yes 
 uhm 
 yeah 
uhm uhm but do you think that if you think too long you
cannot do that anymore 
yes that is a problem but if i can
really emigrate i have the ability to do that
i ' m i ' m just thinking about which country i ' m
 interested in
 
 yeah 
 uhm 
uh ha 
 laughs 
are there many possibilities 
uhm i think australia is very good for me 
and i uh have some relatives and friends there
 
and tut 
yeah that is my first priority 
 
 uh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
well it was you said that uh your parents depend on you in
 the way 
uhm i think that ' s different from 
western type of thinking 
 yes 
 uhm 
uhm uhm
yeah
 
do you i mean is it a huge burden for you 
it ' s quite a huge burden
uhm i realize that i realize this burden especially when i the
time when i came to university because uhm tut you may think that uh
 a university graduate should be very capable uh very
capable in the sense of earning money 
 laughs 
 
 uhm 
uh 
they may think that uhm after so many years of studying 
you can provide us with a more comfortable life 
and i think that is a type of burden 
and my sister is still a year one student 
i have to wait for two more years for her
graduation
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
yeah
but uhm is it that you really uhm i don't want to be too
personal
if you don't want to say you don't have to but do you really
pay uh uhm for your parents when you when you get to work
 will you will you 
 yeah of course 
yeah of course 
 
 so you ' ll you will
even though you would be living somewhere else 
yeah yeah 
 
 really 
yeah 
why not 
 
 that ' s really one word 
 laughs 
i mean i i could never think about that 
you haven't think about that 
 
 no no i don't need to pay anything for my
parents 
oh that means they have to live on their own savings
 
yeah wah i mean my my father still works
my mum can si 
 how about if they retire
 
well my mum mum is retired but uh she gets the uhm
well what ' s that thing 
 laughs 
what do you get the uhm 
payment
 
yeah uhm
because she has been working and she has been 
every month will take something away from the uhm tut
 salary to put away for your pension 
pension 
 oh 
 oh pension scheme 
 
 yeah 
yeah 
yeah
 
uhm uhm
so uhm 
yeah my mother will get this pension pension what
this pens 
 laughs this pension fund every month after 
it is not every month
it ' s a lump sum after you retire
 after you have finished you have used up that
 sum you will have nothing
 
 uh 
 uh 
 uh 
 yeah 
oh 
uhm uhm
 
i think that mum mum would 
 laughs get that as far because it sound like that they get like
from government and then they get something di 
they might get even something different
so they might might get two pen pensions 
uhm uhm
 
 so it would be 
 wow 
i ' m quite interested in uhm how do westerners
uh i mean uhm tut do the parents think the
children should take care of their lives after the children are grown
up
 
i don't think that they they want that 
 it is quite different
 
yeah it is 
chinese people
 
yeah it is but you really take care 
 how do they think 
 laughs 
 
i mean my parents give me money 
 laughs 
because you ' re not graduated yet
 
yeah 
after you graduate then
 
uhm well i mean they have said that well when you are rich then
you will give us something but it ' s nothing that i should
i mean it ' s not nothing that i really 
so you shouldn't
 
no it ' s nothing obligatory you know in a way 
oh
 
of course you take care of your parents and relatives 
uhm
 
but it is i think that there ' s basic difference 
uhm uhm
some modern chinese uhm tend to think this
way but many mon many of them still are very traditional
 
 uhm 
yeah 
yeah they might that uhm take taking care of their 
parents uh is sort of filial piety
 
 uhm 
uhm
uhm uhm
yeah it ' s like the confucian confucian 
ideology 
 yeah yeah yeah 
uhm uhm
 
what about on sundays
what do you do exactly
i mean i think that you spend the day with your family 
yes it ' s family day 
 
 so what do you do 
yeah 
what do i do or what do we do is uhm oh nothing
special
uh go to restaurant together and stay at home watch tv or
home videos and do our works
it is not ob 
$a-laughs obligatory that we must stay together but we
prefer to stay together
uhm uhm
 
 uhm 
is that also changing uh in a way for the modern like you
said that there are some modern 
yeah yeah yeah
 
uhm hong kong people do you think that they
don't care other people or they care 
 uhm uhm 
 cares for what 
 
for their family in that sense they just do something
individually 
yes but uh what we meant by family day uh nowadays is
not something that we should follow 
it ' s not is not so straight 
but uhm maybe it is what our practice
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
what we usually do
 
so you would go to some dim sum uh place
 and 
 and
 laugh 
 yeah 
yes
 
what do you like most uh dim sum 
 dim sum 
 
uhm yeah i mean tell me about those things 
$a-laughs because i 
$a-laughs might know

$a-laughs 
 
oh try to explain 
uhm that is some tut some chickens uhm with
 th

full but very delicious very expensive 
 laughs 
 
 they like strange rice 
 uh 
uh like 
like uhm
 
dessert 
yeah desserts uhm some dim sum with
seafood i think uhm etcetera 
 laughs 
 
 yeah but the food is really different 
 yeah totally different from finnish
 one
 
 what
do you think 
 yeah 
yeah it is
but do you think that uhm chinese when you make the
vegetables you know when you use oil when you uhm
 fry them 
 uhm uhm 
 of course we use oil
 
did don't you think that that ' s one-word
 really 
 and
 laughs 
well that is what our practice is 
if you don't have oils in vegetables i don't know what it
will become 
 and
 laugh 
 
yeah
what you to do 
 you ' re frying something you cannot do that
without oil 
 and
 laugh 
 
uh uh 
what do you do with vegetables
 
oh we we have them uh roll uh 
we make salad 
 yes 
uh
 
or then we cook them but we don't cook all types of vegetables
we might cook carrot cook carrots or uhm something else uhm
 uhm but 
 without oil
 
yeah we cook them just in water 
in water
no oil 
 in oh 
that is not frying
that is boiling
 
yeah yeah yes 
 that ' s why you don't need oil
 
yeah but it ' s not so oily then 
 laughs 
uhm
 
by the way what ' s that 
it ' s a dog
 
it ' s a dog 
 laughs 
 oh yeah you like

you go to see a movie by yourself
 
yeah sometimes 
 uhm i ' ve never
 
but i this one i think that i saw it on video 
uhm
 
do you like those uhm drawn film
how you say
i don't know what they are
i mean that type of movies that are drawn 
 what 
oh cartoons
 
yeah 
uhm cartoon is quite famous or popular in hong kong
 especially the uhm tut books
japanese cartoons is extremely popular but not
 very good morally i think
 
 oh 
 oh 
why 
maybe uhm it just meet the taste of the average
youngsters in hong kong
they tut most of them uhm are not very not
very what 
 laughs 
not very pure
i mean pure
 
uhm uh well i wonder what they what they uh
i mean did do do they have a lot of uh uh brutality or
what do you mean they are not poor 
not pure 
 
 pure 
 yeah 
 not pure
in the sense that they may like seeing others fighting
 
seeing uhm some sexy sexy uhm pictures
they they don't like very academic 
 and
 laugh 
very
well i don't know 
if some publishers or some cartoon drawers want
 to make money they have to meet the taste
 
 yeah yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm uhm do you think that the university students in hong
kong are uh certain type of people 
for example if you uhm if you think about some other people
who don't go to the univeristy aare they different
i mean the university students and other young people 
 who don't go to the univeristy 
 uhm uhm side b 
don't think they are very different except when they are in
school
i i mean they are having their lessons discussing some
very academic things or talking about their prospect
how they choose their job
because i think they themselves may think they can get
very they can get higher position or have higher
wages than others
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
yeah 
and de in that sense they may be quite proud of
themselves
 
yeah but do you have that uhm friends who are not in the
university who are working for example 
yes i have but not many
 
yeah i mean that you basically have friends who are in
the university
is this that like for many many university students
uh their friends friends are also from university
most of them are from university
 
 uhm yeah 
but for example in my church i know some some of our
fellows are not university students 
they have to work
 
 uhm 
 oh yeah 
yeah 
maybe because uhm they are church goers they
they are quite uhm good guys
 
 uhm 
yeah yeah
so you don't really know any uhm tut 
what ' s this tut chinese uh uh uh 
the the bad guys i mean who are shooting at each other
what is what is it called in hong kong 
 shooting each other 
 
 triads triads 
oh yeah
 
so you don't know anybody 
i don't know triad members 
 laughs 
 
because i ' ve heard that they they have 
 i ' m not involved in triad society 
 
 yeah but i i heard that they even even try
to get into the univeristies that they have everywhere people
 who belong to triads 
do you think it ' s true 
 uhm 
you mean some university student
 
yeah 
uh involved in triad society
i i don't know
 
 yeah 
uh i mean do you think well do you think that it could be
possible 
yeah i think it is possible but i think that is not a
serious problem as some secondary school have today because some uhm 
 si secondary school of lower standards and they 
have every sort of students from every part
of the society 
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
 uh uh 
uhm uhm
 
so you think that the tut uhm kids from lower
 social classes will get into the triads 
 yeah it is easier to get into
those society si 
 
 yeah 
 and
 laugh 
well what what will you do when you go back to
finland
 take up take up 
uhm continue your study immediately
 
 what will i do 
 yeah 
uhm almost
i ' ll be there on thursday morning i think and 
on monday i ' ll start
