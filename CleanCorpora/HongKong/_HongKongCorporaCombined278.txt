sar workers have yet to feel any benefit from the economics recovery this was the observation that premier zhu rongji made known to reporters after the association of southeast asian nations meeting in singapore last month for many of the compatriots living in hong kong who feel the pinch of the economic downturn this piece of remarks by one of the chinese leaders has definitely struck a chord premier zhu also added that he had learned a lesson from sar workers ' grievances and pledged a pay rise for mainland workers next year it was a rare occasion that mainland workers became the envy of their sar comrades in fact donald tsang yam-kuen financial secretary was quick to respond to the remarks he pointed out harshly but correctly that wages in hong kong are determined by the market when the economy further improves and companies make more profits employers would consider pay rises in light of the situation of their businesses  as a matter of fact hong kong economy has recorded a very strong growth for the first three quarters of two thousand following the growth of fourteen point two percent in the first quarter and ten point nine percent in the second quarter gdp again attained a double-digit growth at ten point four percent in real terms over the year earlier  for the first three quarters of two thousand as a whole gdp had a highly robust growth of eleven point seven percent in real terms over a year earlier as a result the forecast growth rate in real terms of gdp for two thousand as a whole was revised upward from the earlier eight point five percent to ten percent on the other hand the unemployment rate showed a further decline in september to november two thousand to four point six percent slightly lower than that in august to october two thousand at four point seven percent the unemployment rate stood at two point six percent in september to november two thousand same as that in august to october period with all these promising figures it is not surprising that a number of major local corporations and banks have already indicated that pay rises from two to five percent will be awarded to employees with all these good news premier zhu should be happy for these lucky ones again financial secretary tsang demonstrated his good understanding of the market economy good for you donald  then is hong kong really on the road of recovery maybe even if it is it would be a very long road particularly for those who are badly hurt by the troubled economy the middle class is among those most hard- hit many of them are facing shrinkage in the values of their assets as owners of negative-equity properties they lost their life savings when the property prices went downward in the past few years as investors they were beaten twice in the stock market  first in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis and second in the burst of the dot com bubble earlier this year as professionals they have to compete for jobs at lower fees as managerial executives they have to accept more workload with lower pay as entrepreneurs they have to face a tougher market as a matter of fact quite a number of them are among the statistics of layoffs and bankrupts as the government is cutting fat many middle-income earners working in the government also feel the pinch of the economic difficulties although civil servants are supposed to enjoy job security many of them are facing uncertainties with the possible privatisation of their departments or rigid adherence to their bosses to the enhanced productivity programme the government ' s cost-trimming exercise has also affected those non-civil servant professionals and staff working in the government projects take my constituents engineers as an example newly recruited resident site engineers for government projects have to accept salaries at lower entry points and a very harsh four-month break in service rule if the middle class is in such a sorry state you can imagine the predicaments of those who aspire to join the rank again i want to quote an example from my constituency to illustrate my point  in the past engineer graduates who wished to join civil service as government engineers would usually join the works bureau graduate training scheme a number of graduates of ninety-six and ninety-seven joined the scheme with the hope that they might follow the footsteps of their seniors and became civil servants upon the completion of the training scheme alas the economic downturn has completely wrecked their plans as government departments have to follow the enhanced productivity programme only a handful of permanent posts are made available to those young engineers it is most disappointing to see that these brilliant young engineers intensively trained by the government are only offered non-civil service contract with very unfavourable employment terms worse still they will have to leave the government when their current employment contracts expire like other young professionals these young engineers are facing many uncertainties in their future but one thing is certain they are on the wrong side of timing indeed some people have argued that the middle class is the only victim in this economic meltdown the rich are too wealthy to feel the pinch while the poor have nothing to lose i see their point about the rich particularly some of the super rich but i cannot agree with their argument about the poor they are right that the poor own no properties and they don't have the problems with negative-equity they are right that the poor own no stock shares and they don't have problems with slides in the stock prices  however they are wrong to say that the poor have nothing to lose at least there is one thing that the poor can lose and the only one thing that they cannot afford to lose ie their jobs as a matter of fact many low-skilled workers in hong kong were amongst the first casualties in the present economic adjustments the present economic situation has further marginalised the low-income group to no-income group believe it or not one-sixth of the households living in public rental housing flats about one hundred and fifteen thousand families are relying on welfare or the so-called comprehensive social security as  assistance the government was heartless enough to push through the increase in fees and charges last week although many colleagues in legco voted for the increase i did not agree with it  my line of thinking is very simple despite the promising economic figures released recently a strong recovery is not in sight it is not the right time to seek the increase as many people out there have difficulties in making ends meet while many businesses are struggling for the survival instead of wasting their precious time in lobbying the legco members to support the increase which will only bring in about seven million to the government coffers in the coming year the government officials should have much better things to do for instance to revive our economy  feeling the urgency i suggested to two legco members that we could join forces with construction- related professional bodies to push the government to speed up the implementation of infrastructure as you are aware the government has committed to invest more than two hundred and forty billion dollars in infrastructure development in the coming few years these projects will be instrumental in spurring our economy and creating many jobs for local professionals and workers however little progress has been made to many of these projects as they get entangled with bureaucratic red tape and land resumption problems we already had our first meeting with representatives of ten professional bodies to make out our action plan  so far the government is strong in its rhetoric and weak in its actions it is time for it to do something to speed up the economic recovery merry christmas and happy new year  the term sustainable development was first introduced in nineteen eighty seven in a report our common future produced by the world commission on environment and development wced there it was defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs the nineteen ninety two united nation conference for environment and development also known as rio earth summit adopted this definition and to date over one hundred countries are making efforts to promote sustainable development and hong kong is one of them  as i recall the chief executive raised the subject in his nineteen ninety eight policy address he went further in his policy address the following year and announced that the intention to establish a sustainable development unit sdu to monitor the impact of major new policy proposals and provide analysis and support to a proposed council for sustainable development csd the first legislative council also discussed the subject in a form of a motion debate in october nineteen ninety eight basically sustainable development provides a framework of economic growth and development with minimum negative impact on resources available to us and this allows our society to continue functioning into the indefinite future in order words the concept focuses growth maximizing benefits in the long run rather than short-term gains but one may wonder what exactly the concept is relevant to us the final definition of sustainable development for study on sustainable development for the twenty-first century in short susdev twenty one provides enlightenment  quote sustainable development in hong kong balances social economic environmental and resource needs both for present and future generations simultaneously achieving a vibrant economy social progress and a high quality environment locally nationally and internationally through the efforts of the community and the government unquote the elaboration of the secretary for planning and lands mr gordon siu at a recent press conference announcing the findings and recommendations of susdev may provide you a better guide he said sustainable development is an abstract concept to implement this concept we have to apply it in a practical life in different aspects including economy health hygiene natural resources social facilities cultural activities and transportation if you are still unable to grasp the concept don't blame yourself and don't put the blame on gordon either he made a very nice try by relating the concept to practical life you may perhaps be too occupied with problems in practical life to see the whole picture of its relevance to you think about it what sustainable development means to you if you are at home exposed to high levels of traffic noise what the sustainable development means to you when you walk in major roads and streets of causeway bay or central in days of high air pollution index api what sustainable development means to you when you look at the deplorable state of our treasured victoria harbour road traffic noise is one of the most pervasive forms of pollution in hong kong close to a million people suffer road traffic noise higher than the minimum acceptable standard seventy dba in the hong kong planning standards and guidelines there must be a finite but hard-to-calculate amount of adverse effect of traffic noise on these people and their health i don't think sustainable development means much to these people unless their homes become a quieter place indeed various measures can be introduced to address this traffic noise problem these include installing roadside barriers and enclosures roads resurfacing roads with low noise surface materials or change of road alignment can also bring some relief to those households being affected in areas where it is infeasible to introduce these measures the government ought to in identify other suitable non-engineering noise mitigation alternatives namely banning heavy vehicles on certain roads speed reduction or pedestrianization believe it or not even a simple measure such as covering manhole caps with asphalt in roads will definitely relieve thousands of nearby residents from the flip-flops caused by the metal caps being rolled over by passing vehicles talking about noise pollution it is very unfair not to mention those households being affected by the aircraft noise it is true the aircraft noise has ended for those living under the kai tak airport flight path with the relocation of the airport to chek lap kok  however the government must be responsive to the concern of the residents living under the new flight paths who were previously unaffected the government has the responsibility to study and implement noise mitigation measures to address their problems now let us turn to another subject about the air we breath in case you like many of our senior officials live in an air-conditioned environment all the time just take a walk in causeway bay central or mong kok you will get a pretty good idea of how bad our air quality has turned into or if you are a scientific-minded person just go to study the api records for the past few years the same conclusion can be reached every time when the api hits record high the authorities give us a list of factors accounting for the poor air quality such as airborne pollutants from the pearl river delta or the absence of air movement to dispel the pollutants at street level or emissions from buses and diesel vehicles et cetera et cetera as a routine the government always takes every opportunity to reiterate that cleaning up the air is high on its agenda but it takes time for the improvement i totally agree that there is no miracle we can't just have clean air overnight even so the air quality in hong kong should have stopped deteriorating however it seems not to be the case in hong kong if the government is incapable in solving our air pollution problem it is at least capable in screwing up our treasured victoria harbour i must say that the harbour looks more like a nullah now i don't want to repeat here the fiasco of the expensive strategic sewage disposal scheme ssds which is a long and controversial story all i hope is that the government can become wiser after the expensive lesson and will act shrewdly to come up with the best sustainable option for the urban sewage disposal and treatment unless the government can see things from the perspective of ordinary people it will have problems in enlisting the support and involvement of the community in the sustainable development in hong kong unless the government can show its determination to solve our environmental problems the term of sustainable development means no more than rhetoric or just another high-sounding concept
