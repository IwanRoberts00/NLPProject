and then uhm we wait 
uhm because we join a tour right and it was so
but it it was a bit rush cause uh people are like uhm
they don't give they don't give us uhm enough time to run around
 and then the the old quebec city it was so
it was so neat
the buildings are so nice and then uhm
and then the streets it was quite different from from those in
toronto
like the uhm the kind of old buildings they don't
seem 
toronto are like more than once
so it was like one word 
the feel is like going to europe because europe
what about you
what about your europe trip
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 oh 
oh that ' s good too
it ' s really great then
i ' ve just uhm talked i ' m mention it again with my classmate
yesterday
 uhm yes we really fun you know
we have we have uhm explore a lot and this is our ad 
adventure you know
we we don't uhm we haven't be like been like this in hong kong
you know
we we just uh carrying our our luggage and then we are
 
and we are rushing for for a train and we ' re we are going to
somewhere that we can't uhm we can't understand the language like french or
uhm
we go to france and go to holland but we can't speak their
language
 oh yeah 
 one word 
that ' s good because
maybe your trip is better than mine because uh
when i join the tour you know the food really suck
 and the food is really bad and then but the other
things are okay but the food is not that good
but when you go by yourself you can you can go to a rest 
you can go to find restaurant by yourself and then you one word
 much better than our
 uhm uhm 
yes but i i think the uhm
how to say the
the famous food of all of the countries not that good really good
for example in uh we went to switzerland and the fondue is very
famous
fondue
yes like like the the the cheese hot pot we are
but it ' s it ' s one word 
really disgusting really really
it ' s not suitable for us and we don't enjoy that that that dinner
but this ' s not that ' s not cheap you know
yeah it it ' s quite expensive in uh in europe
yes but 
 but we we should go some somewhere else
like when i come back to hong kong and then go to uh maybe go to
japan or thailand and have some fun
oh let ' s go to thailand
it is cheap
yeah but i i want to go to japan to do i want to go
shopping there
but it ' s too expensive we ' ve 
we have to spend a lot of money there
 i know 
but thailand is good though
you we can go to swimming and then uhm i i bet there there are not
much not much shark sharks in there as in hong
and and i know uhm
then we can also shopping and do shopping in thailand you know
just uhm
the things are cheap uh rather cheap
i think it ' s cheaper than in hong kong especially for the
something like lv or bally ' s
some famous brand you know 
 that ' s good 
let ' s go together
yes if you 
when you come back then we will go to the travel agency and we
will find the suitable uhm package okay
