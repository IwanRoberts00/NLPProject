uhm uhm
uhm uhm
for how long
 
last year since i had a long holiday i spent
almost two months in in japan 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
you must have taken a a very big rest in japan
 
no actually i 
$z and
$a laugh 
no but two months
 
uhm but i uh work
i had library work in japan 
really
uhm uhm
 
uhm 
 they have very good library in tokyo 
 for my study so i went to it 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
then are you a uh tokyo people

uh uh
 
i am from hokkaido 
uh from hokkaido
 
uhm 
and you study uhm in hokkaido
 
yes 
ah
 
have you been in hokkaido 
 no but 
 no but i want to all laugh 
yeah es especially the place called sapporo
 
uhm 
uhm uh yeah but i heard the news i i i think mr muraka
murakami also knew that uhm there is some fall of the of the big rocks
 in hokkaido during the winter
 
 yes yes 
 uhm 
uhm 
it ' s really a pity that over twenty
people inside the tunnel were buried
and because it takes it took the p uh the police it
take uhm it take the police some time to s to to how to say to move
the rock 
 and so a few days later all people inside were
died 
it ' s really
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh huh 
when did it happen
it ' s uhm
i think it ' s be just before the new year of hong kong
 
uhm 
it ' s really uh
it ' s really pitiful 
i ' ve heard that uhm hokkaido is very is a very beautiful place
 especially at at winter
 
uhm 
is it really true
 laughs 
do you think so
 
yeah but very very cold 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm
 
minus thirty twenty two-words all
laugh 
it is very uhm hot comparatively in hong kong
uhm
 
yes 
so i see you always wear uh not not 
$z laughs very much clothes
 wear uh 
yeah but on the week uh of the new year it ' s really very cold 
 just five or six degree in hong kong
 
 yes 
uhm yes
yeah i just can't move really stay in the bed all day but i
think sensei must be very uhm uh very active because it
it it ' s just like the summer time for you
 
no i don't i don't like cold 
ah really but 
 
 i don't like cold 
maybe because in japan there are always heaters inside indoor
so you you don't feel cold but in hong kong
no
really very cold
uhm uhm uhm 
have you been to other countries besides austria
uhm uhm
 
i was in singapore singapore 
for five years 
 uhm uhm 
 singapore 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm
working there
 
uhm 
research
 
uhm and teaching 
and teaching of course japanese i suppose
uhm
 
yes japanese
no in singapore i i taught japanese language only one year 
 
and the other four years i taught japanese literature 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
uhm
and the medium is japanese uhm
 
no i i was teaching second year student i then have honour
course four year 
uhm uhm secondary student 
 
 so i i was i was teaching second year student
 and fourth year one-word
 student and we can uh use japanese as teaching material 
teaching language in fourth year 
but in the second year i was teaching japanese literature in
english and i found it a bit strange 
so here i want to use two-words japanese
material but the language literary language level is a
bit higher than three words 
uh literary language level is a bit higher than second year
students 
 ah 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uh do you enjoy uhm teaching
 
uhm no 
$a and
$b laugh 
well i like uh to prepare for teaching
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
 
but actually i i don't like uh to teach in class 
really
uhm uhm really
uhm is it because uhm you like uhm preparing because uhm
 uh during your are preparing the work uh you learn something
 
uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
 
yeah perhaps that is one of the reasons i think 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm
but don't you think that when you really use your material
and s and sat in front of class and and tell the students that oh
what you have uhm made uhm from your from your hard work
then isn't uh don't you think that it is more fun to do so in
teaching
 
uhm uhm
yeah 
it ' s okay for me to do something together with student 
 but what i uh don't like is perhaps uh teaching is
something but to force someone to do 
 something right 
and in that sense to force student to do uhm what 
teachers think right 
it seems to me a bit arrogant isn't it
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm but i think uhm teach uhm to teach uhm
 is a thing that uhm help the student to learn something 
 but uhm i think uhm it is subjected to the students 
uhm themselves uh to uhm digest uh the materials
 uhm 
 
 uh 
 yes 
uhm 
i don't think it ' s it ' s something pushy 
uh because uhm when you teach you believe that it is good
for them right 
and actually uhm you are doing the job to stimulate the
student to learn so i don't think it is really something
pushy unless there are many many routines and similar
work then some sometime i think it ' s kind of pushy but if if it ' s just
kind something uhm some kind of assignment which is interesting and not d
 doing repeatedly then i think i don't think it is some uh really
something a a force to the students
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
 yes 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm 
uhm uhm
 
it ' s fine 
uhm uhm
uhm
 
but one point is we have to evaluate student standard 
 and we evaluate on the standard and that means that
means we are forcing these sort of criteria or standard to the students
you have to work on these uh ground 
otherwise you pay 
which means in a sense we are forcing these standard to you 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm in some in some sense laughs 
uhm uhm
 
well to say for example to pass on information or knowledge
 it ' s okay 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
 
but three words disappointed i i think
evaluation 
you know that evaluate we have to we need standard 
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
and it is the point that uhm every every teacher or
student are are arguing about
should we use assessment or should we use exam
 
uhm uhm 
some prefer continuous assessment then it will it seems more
fair
but at the same time something that uhm yeah exam is more uhm
appropriate to treat as a kind of uhm assessment of student ' s performance
 
uhm 
uhm uhm
yeah and both have their advantages and disadvantages 
 i i think
if you use continuous assessments it ' s fair because uhm you you
uhm the teacher assess your work uhm continuously and uhm but the the bad
point may be the students maybe uhm may have a heavy burden that he or she
has to do a constant work uhm regularly and it may spend them quite a lot of
time
uhm but if they if we use exam then there will also a problem that
 uhm your success is depended on one is uh depends only on one exam
 or just a few tests then it may not be fair too
maybe the students or is sick when he is uhm taking the exam or
maybe uhm there are some some kids troubled with some problems and
then he he cannot do well 
so sometimes i also wonder oh what what what what which one is
better for me 
ya and yet up till now both both two are not laughs very
suitable for me
i don't know
 uhm 
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
 
what i am talking about is language teaching probably 
 but i don't know how can i say to an extent
for example student say something and and teacher
say you were wrong because you it is illogical 
it ' s not logical
but in my mind sometimes i think it is logic right then
that without this logic we can't evaluate 
that means we are forcing this logic forcing
logic to students so we are not teaching then to
it ' s no i mean
it ' s very difficult to teach student to break this logic system
 and complain ground 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm do you mean that uhm uhm s it is uhm
 uh hard to uhm have the student to have uhm uh independent thinking
 
ya uh ya something like that 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm
sometimes i think especially for uhm language learning uhm
 uhm students usually don't have much uhm independent thinking
because it ' s it ' s just some uhm you get the meaning and then is and that ' s
all
but if you study other subject it work for many chinese study
or for others at least english literature you have to have your own ideas
 to appreciate the literature yeah
it ' s really different
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
uhm two words 
yeah some yes
that ' s why uhm i i found my think my independent thinking
getting less and less because what i needed to do is to yeah to study hard to
know the meaning and know how to use and yeah other part of my of
analytical mind is uhm because it ' s it ' s not very often used then 
 then it becomes less and less
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 
 sometimes i think that the the language teaching is
very very much arrogant job for native speaker 
 because no matter how hard you study 
 once native speaker says no you don't say so 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yeah
 
and you are wrong definitely 
yeah
uhm uhm
yeah i agree
but uhm back to your question i think uhm i think uhm to
uh to learn to be uhm independent in the thinking and to have analytical
thinking
i think uhm it is like a process
 one should 
like a process
 a road 
yeah
one has to uhm uhm roll along the road uhm before uhm 
uh when a when one learn to be analytical uhm he or she had to get uhm some
uhm information from others
she had to uhm uhm grasp a lot of things uh i think to teach is to
uhm uh to uhm to give the student to have such uh uh information
 
 like what 
 process three words 
uhm
uhm uhm
so i don't think uhm it is arrogant and because i think i don't i
think uh it is our action it is an action to uhm uhm to force the
student to think so 
maybe at that time uhm they uhm they may agree with you
but uh later when their experience grow and they will uhm learn more
uhm uhm yes
 
okay 
$a laughs i will do my best 
actually i heard that uhm yeah mr murakami is uhm yeah has
has one-word a lot and uhm very happy in the lesson 
$a laughs even though i am not a student i i heard this
yeah it ' s uhm it ' s interesting to uhm to join class of mr of mr
murakami ' s
have you have you received this kind of feedback from the
students 
 yes from your students 
 
no 
 laughs no 
 no 
 
no the first time 
how about how about 
$z laughs how about ophelia and belongna
 uh yeah 
 
ah 
yeah
we always heard that oh it ' s really interesting
 yes 
 actually i enjoy uhm uh attending uh your
class
 
japan in japanese 
uhm yes
 
uhm 
because uhm i think uhm it is interesting to uhm have
discussion during the class
 
uhm 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm
 
 is that right
thank you very much 
uhm but i i think it is true that uhm to teach is a
very difficult job and to teach uhm good is a difficult job
but it is also one-word but it is a
divine divine you know uhm very divine job that you have a a very uhm
import you are you are sharing a very important responsibility uhm to to pass
the knowledge to student and help them to equip themselves for the society
a kind of divine divine job you see the define uhm
divine means uhm uhm something related to the god very divine
uhm uhm uhm
do you get the meaning sensei 
 
uhm 
but you can say
 
but still i prefer studying to teach to to
teaching 
i mean if you uh what do you like to to do after your
graduation
teacher 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm
uhm i i had uh thought about uh uh uh being a teacher
when i ' m when i was young but i don't like all laugh 
well for me uhm yes same as you when we were young 
we appreciate the teacher very very much 
two-words 
 we were small 
 it is an interesting job
yeah we want to become a teacher at that time and right now
uhm yeah the the desire to become a teacher uhm is getting less but still
it is part of my consideration after my graduation
 uh uh 
me too
yeah but i think uhm to be a teacher uhm needs quite a lot of
experience
i think it is just too fresh for us to to teach after soon after
graduation
i think uh if i actually i think if i really uh want to become
a teacher uhm i plan to go to maybe if i can teach english and i i think i
should at least spend one year in england to uhm to experience uhm the
culture as well as to train up my language before i i really
teach the student
because even after graduation i don't think i am capable to to
teach student yeah
just uhm yeah both of the personality and also my uhm my 
abilities is not not really so much to do so
yeah
 
 yeah uhm 
 uhm 
uhm moreover uhm i think uhm the reason uhm is that uh
for me a a i don't like to be a teacher because first of all i think i get
the same problem as gloria
and because i think uhm uh i have not confidence to be teacher
 to be a good teacher
uhm one-word because i think uhm uh my
experience is not very much 
uh moreover uh the youth nowadays uhm is difficult to
teach
 uhm uhm 
yeah
uhm because there are currently many news uh talking
about uhm the suicides of students 
and students nowadays are very naughty and
the society is very complicated making the students uhm
 thinking a very hard to grasp
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm yeah i see 
 and i don't know uhm what they think
 
uhm uhm 
uhm
yes a long pause 
and what do you think laughs 
do you think we 
 
 no still i i i think i i like perhaps perhaps
no
i i have been no i like studying 
 uh more than teaching all laugh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
it is fine
i think yeah having your own uhm interest in certain subjects and
go ahead
i think yeah it ' s also a kind of pleasure
uhm i came across an interesting question
uh how will you teach your s son if you have a son 
 or a daughter
 uhm 
uhm
 
uhm 
uh will you think that uhm when you teach your son or
daughter will you think also think that uhm you are forcing uh your son or
daughter
 
uhm 
you think so
 
uhm 
so will you choose to let them do on the way they they like
 if you really have a son or daughter 
 i think two words 
 
 if if i force if it is three words
 about that
i think if i do that uh my son or
daughter who be can't living society right 
$a laughs so in order that make themselves i think i have to teach
them 
$a laughs i have to teach them what they must do 
what they should do and they but but they they must
not do one-word which i don't
want to teach 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
and uh i want to know uhm uhm do you have uhm any
religion
 
uhm 
no
no
but do you have some kind of traditional japanese uhm 
 religion 
 
 are you talking about shinto 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm
 
oh definitely two words 
 many japanese believe shinto and 
buddhist
yes
 
buddhist 
uhm uhm
 
it is said that many japanese uhm no 
i see
uhm then sensei uhm what what ' s your philosophy of your life
 
philosophy 
uhm your life 
what what you aim at in your life or what kind of uh attitude you
view your life is
 
aim of life 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 
no aim 
 ya 
do you have dreams then
 dreams 
 dreams 
 
dreams ideal or hope 
 uhm uhm uhm yeah
 
yes to live quietly and calmly 
uhm uhm 
$a &
$b laugh 
 
that ' s all
