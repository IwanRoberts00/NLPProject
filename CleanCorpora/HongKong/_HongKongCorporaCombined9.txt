yah i think i have if you want to play tennis i can help you to book a tennis court    aw okay but i need to uhm but i need to have like uhm do i need to have you with me all the time  i think so and you have to buy a ticket yah    okay still two words  you see every time i pass by there i see the tennis courts  uh huh   yah and i i don't know where else in hong kong where i can book tennis court i was told that the public court is very hard to book   uhm   yah   yeah yeah yeah  yah so thought we can just go in like pay a fee   and use it if the students are not using it   uhm  oh i i can uh help you to ask yah     okay okay that would be great thanks  you ' re welcome oh uh you live in singapore   uhm yeah most of my life  oh   yah  uh when     i was born i was born in singapore and  live there and educated there and just moved to hong kong recently   uh huh  oh i see   about five months ago  five months ago    yeah   uhm  what what do you think about like the difference between hong kong and singapore   uhm well and i think   uh the cleaning system right it ' s more clean than hong kong     yes yah it ' s lot like it ' s lot cleaner  and more orderly in singapore i guess yah but uhm hong kong is a livelier city   yeah  uhm   yah it ' s definitely a lot more people a lot more things happening yah you know there are four seasons in hong kong uh spring   s uh summer autumn and winter and it is very very hot in summer and very very cold in   w uh winter     uh   well not not not that cold in winter actually but colder than singapore  yeah  aw     yah s so uhm i quite enjoy the cold weather yeah because uhm you get to wear at least i get to buy more clothes yeah more fashionable yah i think   first   yeah   but you have no difficulty in adjusting  life in hong kong    uhm  uhm not really i suppose the the biggest thing that i uhm that took that took me a longer time to adjust was basically the lack of space  uh yah   yah uhm   so where do you live uh   uhm bonham road it ' s very near to hong kong u  aw    yah i rent i a place rent a place that eight hundred square feet and it is so small even though it ' s only my husband and i living there but it ' s just so small because back in singapore where we were used to having much bigger place than than this  plus all sort for the kind of rental we pay here   okay   yeah   yah yah  uhm  we could can we can get like you know a huge place a flat or house or one-word so that ' s that was quite hard to follow actually   in singapore   yeah   yah   the housing price is very high in hong  kong yah   yah   yeah   and for and for their price you don't get much yah you don't get much space or facilities that ' s my main regret you know but other than that uhm it ' s more fun here i like the cityscape i like the hills and the and the flat is next to the sea i like the harbour   aw   uhm uhm     yah   yeah   and i like to go hiking on wee uh during weekends  where  yah     yah  lantau island   lantua i ' ve not been i ' ve been to lamma island   uh ah   yah i ' ve been to sai gung sai kung, a place in hong kong and uhm where else i ' ve done uhm the wilson trail at uhm daaih daaih taahm two-words daaih taahm tai tam, a place in hong kong. the speaker repeats each word two to three times   a few words    yeah  where ' s daaih taahm tai tam    it ' s it ' s in eastern sai   sai kung yeah     it is it ' s on hong kong island but on eastern side   aw   yeah  aw yah   yah  i haven't been there   oh okay it ' s good it ' s good fun it took about three hour three three hours it ' s  quite a rough time   uh huh  yah   yah  usually i walk around shatin   oh okay is it where you stay  yah i live in shatin   shatin shatin is uhm is it on kowloon side  yeah kowloon side yeah    oh okay  not new territories uh it doesn't consider to be in new territories  it considers to be kowloon i think  oh     okay  uhm uhm  uhm uh do you know that uhm the student in hong kong u majoring in the translation and english  uhm    oh really okay  did alex tell you that before     no   no  so you have to tell her first     oh okay  yah so she knows japanese   oh okay   a little bit only okay that ' s enough     yeah so she ' s studying a few languages  including   uhm yah english uh cantonese uhm mandarin   cantonese  yah cantonese     do you still have to learn cantonese  yah but i can't speak cantonese   yeah like like the grammar     oh okay  yah like the grammar   oh okay just like english  okay okay   yup and a little bit japanese   okay and this is all part your of your course   at the university course of   yah   no no  usually i only take uhm translation and english studies in the campus and i also take uhm some courses from uh business administration such hu uhm as human resource and business law and these courses are more interesting than the courses offer by the translation department     okay  yah   okay translation is basically what mandarin to english is it  uh chinese to english and english to chinese   oh okay  yah   chinese you mean cantonese right or   uh written chinese and in oral  translation we translate uhm english it to uh cantonese and cantonese to chinese uh to english yah     oh okay   okay  i find it quite hard to learn cantonese  you can speak in mandarin yeah  yah i i can speak in mandarin i was educated in both languages mandarin and english  uh huh   yah uhm from age of six yah so i can do both pretty well but cantonese is a big big problem   uhm  why   the pronunciation is so difficult  ah   yah my husband   but you can hear    i can i yah i can understand because my  husband is cantonese   yeah   yeah  aw   even though he is also singaporean and because back in singapore we live with his parents and he always uhm communicate with his parents in cantonese so i pick up a lot of phrases yah i pick up a lot of phrases and i can uhm i understand it quest well  i actually know how to say it it just that i ' m shy about speaking because uhm my pronunciation is no one can understand me like in the past we can't understand    uhm   uhm uhm   uh   uh huh   that ' s okay just just like me to like to speak english yah may be a bit shy but only more practice yeah    yah i suppose  yah his english is good   uh at least you know the the the bad the bad thing right   yah   you have     but it ' s hard to get around my husband can tell ten thousand and one times about how to pronounce something in cantonese but i would not be able to get it because i ' ve got i ' ve got like english intonation and chinese intonation  and i ' ve i ' m hokkien so i ' ve got hokkien intonation  so it ' s so hard to get it right   oh yah   aw  aw i see but his english is good because he studied in canada  yah  in canada    oh okay   six years   oh okay  wow   yeah  did you do your so you you don't only did your you did your a-levels in canada as well   no just the uhm hkcee level   uh that ' s o level is it   yup   yeah o level yeah o level     oh o levels and okay  and then   and then go to the canada and studied for six years   six years  yeah   okay what did you major in  economics  oh okay  was it   the same as you   yeah   aw     that ' s right  which university in canada  uh western ontario   oh okay   do you know that   yeah yeah it ' s quite well known university oh okay why didn't you stay on there to work   uh i live in dom    oh okay   yeah live in dom and     but what oh okay  and will get back to home once a week because my home is in toronto yeah   so why did you decide to move back here  job   oh you mean you mean there are less there there are no jobs in canada  uh they got jobs but but i prefer to to work in here  more than than canada    okay  yeah   okay it ' s interesting because but if you if if you spend six years there you are already a canadian citizen  yeah yeah yeah yeah   aw okay   yeah    that ' s good   but i like the s life style it ' s so relax   yeah not more two words right  yah   yah it ' s not like here hustle and bustle everybody  rushing around rushing around and you can't walk in peace on the street  yeah  yeah yeah   and all the time you have to watch for for someone ' s laundry on top dripping on you yah   uhm uhm  but uhm i like in here uhm the opportunity is better than canada and uhm basically i like to stay here more than in canada   yeah okay   uhm    i suppose after all i shall go home right in a way i mean you   grew grew up here right  i proba  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah my father and sister is all there    okay   and my father is came in to got a job as well so i live with him too     okay and your grandma  yeah   who does all the lunch for you how lucky is that   that ' s the most important point for me to stay here how lucky at least i got a home homemade lunch it ' s more better to to get out right   like the cook  so he is fatter than before right   okay okay  yeah that ' s why     it ' s good at least you got an option yah and and did you go back to canada for holidays   yeah   one-word  yeah the coming oct uh coming april   uh i i thought you are studying for your exams  someone told me you took leave you are taking leave to study for your exams  aw not not this leave uh study leave the before the cfa exam    oh   that will be majar  yeah i just take the level one    so a lot to be one-word is  yeah   level one is quite simple it ' s multiple choice   yeah cos i heard some of my friend told me that uh level one is just like the honeymoon right   aw yeah in a way in a way but in a way it ' s also  harder because it ' s like the first term you don't really know what to expect any and how much time to put in and a lot of the syllabus would be uhm new to you but in the sense you have some of the syllabus that you are interested it ' s just that during the exam you actually have to write   rather than choose options   yeah   uhm uhm   yeah yeah   uhm uhm  what is the examination   it ' s like a financial uhm examination yah it ' s supposed to like study you know tons of materials and then go for the exam  and it lasts for three years you take three exams in three years   aw   uhm  three exams    yeah for three years   if  if lucky   yeah otherwise you have uh uh a max of seven years in which to take the three exams uhm max of three exams and after that you get a sort of you get a a accreditation uhm that is recognised worldwide in the financial industry yah so a lot of people in financial industry test it   uh huh   aw  so you take the examination in april yeah no no uh in june in june   have you started  yeah   you did uh good the important thing is to s to put in the effort uh   once you put in the effort and you actually do all the reading the exam is not difficult   yeah  uhm uhm yeah   uhm    a lot of people don't really go through the materials that prescribed yah and they just buy the study guides yah and they read the study guides memorize the study guide a months before the exam   one-word note yeah   cos there ' s lots of book to to study if you don't like to study the notes   yah  it costs so expensive  uhm    yah  uhm   in singapore though there ' s a is the pirated versions  uh yeah     some of the shops will buy the  actual and then copy a thousand of it and  they jus continue photocopying for for everyone and you can buy it for like one-word     yeah   and then make copy   yeah   aw   yeah   me too i got a pirate   yeah  yeah pirate one  so     and the one word licence is not very good it ' s just to be  yeah   anyway let ' s talk about you  why talk about me   otherwise you ' ll be excluded  oh no it ' s okay     what what what do you what do you want to do when you this is your final year right  yah   okay  actually i want to do a flight attendant    okay   yah because i like travelling yah  but many people say that oh it ' s a waste to become uhm flight attendant if you obtain your degree yah    okay  uhm i suppose uhm suppose in a way depends on your interest but  yo you uhm you should also think about the long term prospects  yah  yeah     yah because if you if you uhm do become a flight attendant for couple of years  uhm   uhm and then you ' re tired of it and you want to go to something else might be depending on the situation i don't know how easy it is to make the switch  uhm   aw     yeah because by then other people your age would have had a heat stuff  and got some experience   yah  yeah   and got some experience say in industry you  know or whatever yah   uhm uhm   yah  actually i also had some interviews before uh one is the assistant teacher assistant yah by the uh government yah so tut i don't know i think tut it ' s quite difficult to find job in hong kong    okay  really  yah   i thought there are tons of jobs the classified are so thick  but but the main point is you have luck yeah   yeah i suppose so yeah  [ > luck yeah  just like me cos before that job i work in a consulting firm to the firm is doing like uhm collecting some survey the survey is done by analysts, firm manager and the one-word companies so i got tons of address    uhm  okay  and then i send out the resume to all those companies  oh     oh okay and su is one of them   uhm  yes   oh okay  that ' s why i got the job   okay when di when when did you start  not too long ago it ' s right  uh you mean in here   yeah  just no it ' s six months already     okay   yeah     okay   but two months more than me two or three months three months more than me   are you  yeah cos i came to here last april it ' s almost a year   oh okay huh last april  yeah   oh okay so it ' s not it ' s more than six months you ' ve been here uh yeah but for this job it ' s just for six month  cos cos i got convosa convocation i have to go back to canada to to go my convocation   and coming back to here to get this job    oh okay   oh okay  oh okay your first job with the consulting firm was in hong kong as well oh okay   yes and then go back to canada in june for the convo convocation   okay  uhm uhm     it ' s quite a smart move writing to all the companies got jobs offering your  your first company ' s uh database   yeah   uhm cos cos i got the the information that ' s   it ' s just you ' ll enclose that you are interested in  this area   yeah in this this area like wha  whatever assistant what what assistant and then just wait see and wait and then i got reply    okay   oh     so it ' s actually yo you are actually lucky  because   i think so   yah because not many people also do cold call like like this su succeed   yes  yeah   yeah  actually i just got two two interview one is gk ko another one is this in here    okay  okay okay  i got three three round in here   three round wow it ' s it ' s cool   yeah   first  first to meet with the uhm garble   oh okay  garble and then philip   okay  and then the vp human resources   oh caroline  yeah     okay   and then i got the job   oh okay good  uhm now many big companies such as hang seng bank and hsbc are recruiting the fresh graduates in our campus and it says that oh we welcome all the all disciplines but actually most of the uhm positions offer to the students from bba i think    right   b  bba is business admin   yah  yah  okay yeah i suppose you should sort of uhm i mean i suppose your strength is in languages and in english in particular right so i suppose may be you could look for jobs that actually require proficiency in english and you might you might spend   yah   translator   trans    uhm not necessarily have you have you thought about like that uhm journalism   uh   uhm yah     yah in which you can because there ' re a lot of uhm a lot of uhm periodical articles here uhm the magazines are based here like far eastern economic review  uhm uh uh and then obviously the scmp uh south china morning post uhm asian wall street i think is a branch here as well yah so   uhm uhm uhm   is it kind of editor right   uhm as a jour uh i think you have to start off being a journalist  okay  yah you actually have to chase stories cover stories and write editor i think you needs quite a good ma a few years of experience as a journalist   uhm uhm  and the cable tv is now recruiting some uhm translators   yah  uh editors and even the anchors   yah  yah   but anc anchors you will need experience so if if you ' re joining the tv you probably start off as a broadcast journalist  uh huh   yah which is like uhm you still cover stories and you write stories uhm for the anchor woman or anchor man  uhm uhm   to do it you know but uhm if like for instance you need to go to site to report then you know you might appear on tv reporting something o  on site itself  aw   yah you see yeah as a the anchor needs some years of experience i think  uhm yeah tut     one-word is too young so but i mean it ' s it ' s it ' s good at least you can enrich of what you know your skills  uhm uhm   yah or or something to do with english teaching or something   yah   but i ' m not really interested in teaching   oh okay  yah you know the students are v very naughty nowadays yah   okay yah i ' m not very interested in teaching either  but both of you can teach economics    uh   no i don't think so   you don't think so you know i forgot of them most of it a maths i don't use it now do you  i forgot them just like a one-word any question i know how to one-word the question  oh it ' s     yah   that ' s what i remember  uhm    oh okay yah at least you have the base knowledge so it ' s all right  yeah   yeah  i also took ec economics in my year one   okay  did you like   and two words is not  is not the same as the reality   yah yah did you like it  no   okay  that ' s why she took the translation one or two words  yah i think english translation are much more interesting but actually translation is quite boring yah   i can imagine i can imagine just going through just probe into pages and pages of stuff and rewriting them  and this is very subjective you know some people say that oh you are very good but some people say that oh you your skills are not uh enough to translate those stuff yah   okay yeah you can think about journalism it ' s quite interesting but hard work though  yah you have to shift duty yah   uh  and actually the salary is not very high   i was told that uhm south china morning post pays quite well  uh oh   i was told by friend who used to be a journalist in hong kong scmp   yeah but she wasn't in scmp she was in another firm but she i mean she still has friends in the uhm in this circle  and she told me that s c m p actually pays pretty well  uhm uhm  oh  may be you can try to make a cold call to send the send your resume to them   aw     yah and then follow up with a call yah  yeah   when do you graduate  uh i hope in june   uh this a few months time   yah   is that three months time i think  this is your your project final project uhm not really it is one of my homework yah     oh okay so at the end of it what at least suppose to uhm produce  this project   yah yah at the end of this   af after the conversation i have to transcribe the whole conversation to uh english and then write a commentary   oh okay just do it for the team is it  like uhm you know she said this and and that is it you know  oh okay   yah   yeah   yeah  just like a story     oh it will take you some time you should have told me to speak slowly it ' s okay it ' s fine   yeah that ' s okay it ' s okay yeah just like a private conversation it ' s okay   okay  yah so why do you want to be an analyst   why  yeah   i thought was good money  yah it ' s good money    yah yah anyway it ' s it ' s pretty good it ' s okay yah but i uhm actually i ' m not sure whether you know i wasn't actually i interview for an ra job  aw   jonathan actually advertised for a research assistant  and that was why i wanted to because i wanted i wanted zero pressure in  my work i didn't want to be stressed up i just want to come in and do some numbers and then and that ' s it call it a day  aw   yeah  but now you are now   yah well anyway he told me that uh you get paid better as an analyst which   yeah yes   yah and   but you got a great pressure from that  cos you got a project the e kong     but  yeah but uhm in the way uhm in the way i ' m quite fortunate because uhm uhm no matter i mean jonathan is quite understanding he knows that this is uhm this is my first time in this industry and i probably wouldn't know what the sales people are looking for uhm   just like me   yah yah exactly so he ' s not he ' s not that demanding on me and he sort of he sort of facing me one-word  it ' s isn't too bad   uhm  but i think he is dealing good with girls   oh you you think he is very nice to girls  yeah   i heard he wasn't so nice to me though  huh  i heard he wasn't so nice to me though  uh i don't know   yah but anyway i mean he ' s he ' s alright he ' s quite cranky at times   yeah    but uh on the whole i suppose i had worse bosses yeah i mean he ' s tough i mean he ' s okay he ' s a he ' s he ' s a he ' s a quite new experience i hope he once i sort of uhm get over in the show bit uh i got a little bit more experience and i started to enjoy a bit more  yeah  yeah perhaps they work a long for a long time long working hour i mean   yeah yeah i see that ' s true   yeah  the compensation is the salary and the bonus yah i haven't seen it ant yet though  do you got a bonus for this yah uh that ' s cos you are just in here for three months   no when they paid out i only join in december  aw that ' s why     yah   so i got zero one-word    okay   no problem for me this year yeah this year aw   do you like your job  yes i like it cos this is my my job that i want to work it really yeah yes yeah cos the career path is just like to go to analyst and yes the main point is the same as you higher pay   yah   and     being an analysts that ' s why everyone works for yah  the salary is very high here   i don't know  i   not very h uhm yeah for  the industry it ' s very high    uh uh   aw i think   yah the industry as a whole pays quite well  financial industry but two words  i don't think pays that well  yes   uh huh  yeah i think yeah   you you agree or disagree  i i agree i think yeah     yah a lot of other firms in this industry pays a lot better than two words  aw    yeah   yah so your company will recruit all the students from economics and business administration    uhm i ' m not sure whether they do that  uh me too  i ' m not really sure cos you know like i just make a cold call    yah  yah and i ' m not fresh i ' m not a fresh graduate i ' ve been i ' ve worked for about six years  aw   yah but not in this industry   can't see it    huh  can't see it you work for six years     really   yeah   i ' m quite old how old are you  twenty five   i ' m four years older than you oh i ' m twenty two   to be twenty two again yeah aw  uh because i ' ve never uhm my experience hasn't been in this industry   uhm uhm   yah so and all what i wanted to be in this industry because of what i studied and my background and because i was so sick of corporate life uhm   so before that before this job you work in corporate finance   no as in uhm corporates as in companies  aw okay okay     yah in yeah in different industries  uhm uhm   yah  what industry   uhm i was first in uh the ship repair industry  uh huh ship repairing   yes and then and then uhm uh d doing business development and marketing and then i was in uh for a short while in uh food uhm f and b uhm food and beverage uhm company dèlifrance  aw   yah and then i was uh at the same time uhm i was in pacific internet  uhm they ' re all all singapore companies and then my last job i was in a hotel group  involve a lots of industry   yah but actually uhm mostly in one company because i was uhm because the companies sponsored my college uhm degree   so i have to uhm work for them  but the company is a conglomerate so it has got like operations in many manufacturing industries so i was posted around to uhm these different operations which included ship repair f and b and uhm internet and then subsequently when i my bond finished i left them and went to join the hotel group raffles   uhm uhm   aw   okay   aw   aw  uhm so among those jobs which one do you like the the most   none  include this one no     uh uhm i think i still prefer this one to  yah   okay  so was in uhm singapore   yah  before you come to hong kong     yah  yah   that ' s right  uhm   most yah for my in i i was basically up to my studies i was in singapore for about six years  and you study your degree in uk   yah  aw i see   three years best years of my life  why   uhm so much fun i was in london  uh huh   yah and it ' s it ' s an amazing city it ' s just amazing so many things to do and for for me personally uhm because i ' m quite uhm i in a way uhm i prefer their lifestyle  uhm   to say uh the lifestyle back in singapore yah and because i was away from my parents  a few words in my life  i like singapore yah     do you  yah it ' s very clean there   yah but apart from that there ' s something else you can't survive for cleanliness your whole life it ' s so boring  yah really   yah if you expect your life there it is so boring it ' s nothing to do on weekends seriously nothing  uhm uhm   yah and shopping even like you know uhm shopping it ' s there ' s no variety there you see the same shops everywhere you go   oh   aw     yeah  i suppose you will sa you will say the same of hong kong after a while if you live in your whole life but there ' s still a lot more brands here that you don't find in singapore  aw   yah and there ' re lot of uhm boutiques here and   especially around central that carries special names   and and and a lot of these goods are not just carried in singapore   uhm   yeah   uhm uhm  aw   yeah  just like in canada cos they got lots of malls but each malls is is like the same   yah you ' ve the same stores right  yeah   gap two words and uh   yeah    but i suppose i ' ve only been here five months so the novelty  several words  aw   i still find lots of things to do  five months in hong kong   yah yah  yah so have you been to china   uh no not yet i mean not not during my time here but  i ' ve been there several times on business trip   do   okay  aw   yah but i didn't to get see anything yah but i will go but sometime   where have you been there  uhm    i ' ve been to uhm bei jing mandarin pronunciation for beijing uh tian jin mandarin pronunciation for tianjin uh xia men mandarin pronunciation for xiamen uh where else some of the southern or oh i ' ve been to shang hai mandarin pronunciation for shanghai as well uhm two or three words uhm and the few few are the because i was with i travel to china mostly when i was with uhm the shipyard because we were looking at uhm the developing shipyard in china yah so we basically went to look at shipyards so it was all in the sort of coastal areas yah i think to is it island in the south what it ' s call  guangzhou   uh   aw  okay anyway   i can't remember anything else  no but but     is is it helpful  yeah very helpful i ' m sorry that uh it takes a    it it ' s okay no problem  it ' s okay it ' s not much time  so so much time   actually i thought of it ' s going to be a phone call yah  phone call     cos he gave me that impression that there was going to be a phone call  oh actually there ' s anther project that is phone call   oh okay   yah    okay okay okay  but i choose this one   uhm uhm  oh when i participate in this project oh oh my god i didn't know anybody uh who can speak native english yah so i wanted to give up but then i phoned alex did you know anybody     he can be recorded he can be recorded as an native english speaker as well   no i don't think so    but you but your home i mean you spent six years in canada so but the requirement is like uhm you haven't studied in here for like te ten years   oh okay  yah that ' s the major require     aw you ' re not supposed to have studied in hong   kong   yes    is that because uhm the syllabus in hong kong is still today all conducted in cantonese  uhm not actually yeah yeah     oh okay  actually our english is greatly influenced by cantonese yah   how  i don't know   except for the pronunciation it sometimes which is quite distinctive  it ' s like i hear someone speak english i can tell whether the person is from hong kong   yah   yah   uhm uhm  yeah  yeah     yeah because of the pronunciation and   and al and also from the uk or from us cos the the the accent is not the same   yah that ' s right yah  yah and the tenses we do not have tenses you know     in can in in the cantonese in  cantonese yah i guess so   okay  so we al always switch from uh present tense and then to past tense   and back to present tense  yah yah that ' s the problem of english in hong kong i think   but currently uhm only uhm uhm are all the under are all subjects taught in english like maths and science and   uh well in usually in the primary school uh most of the school are taught in cantonese   okay  and in secondary school there are one hundred and fourteen uhm secondary schools uh were taught are taught in english   okay one hundred and fourteen secondary schools out of how many uh   part of the total  have no idea about this  yeah     is it like thousands  i think   i think so   yah     oh okay that ' s a quite a small
