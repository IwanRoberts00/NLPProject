good morning  ladies and gentlemen 
""

our driver today uh is uh mr kwan
""

today uh you just uh  relax and enjoy yourself 
""
uh is my voice okay at the back 
""

""
our tour is called the land between tour
""
the land between just means the area between  the kowloon city
and the border of hong kong china and uh usually we call that the new
territories  because uh hong kong consists of the uh hong kong island 
kowloon peninsula  new territories and two hundred and thirty-five
outlying islands 
""
and uh  first of all i will give you a map  showing what we
are going to do today  long-break 
""
so uh we  ' re already now in kowloon
""
so uh we start our journey now  and uh we will first travel to
uh tsuen wan 
""
tsuen wan is the uh first satellite town here in hong kong 
""
hong kong got only an area of a thousand and seventy  s 
square kilometers  and uh  we have uh more than seven million people
 so the government have to uh develop many new towns  and tsuen wan is
the first one 
""
later on you will see other new towns in the uh new territories 
like uh tai po fanling and uh shatin
""
and uh  our first stop will be in uh  chuk lam monastery
""
it  ' s a very typical monastery practicing buddhism  and uh we
have uh enough time  to look at the monastery  and uh if you have time
to visit other monastery here in hong kong you can compare them 
""
actually today uh we have a tape commentary  explaining  to
you the things on our way  and i just give you uh  some more
information
""
and uh if you have uh any  question do not hesitate to ask me
""
""
i will try my best to answer your question 
""
after visiting uh chuk lam monastery we will  travel up to tai
mo shan
""
tai mo shan is the highest mountain in hong kong  so we are only
half way up  where there is a outlook  and there we can have a look in
a harbour and also the uh  out  some of the outlying islands 
""
then down the uh  tai mo shan we will pass through shek kong 
to uh luen wo market 
""
luen wo market is a very traditional  chinese style market and
uh is uh very interesting especially for the uh europeans 
""
and then we travel further north towards uh sha tau kok 
""
sha tau kok is a  restricted area  we can only go inside with
a permit  so uh we will turn south to luk keng 
""
later on the tape will tell you more about this uh interesting
place 
""
at luk kan in luk kan the scenery is uh completely different 
with a  1 word  there  because it  ' s a protected area
for the birds 
""
then we will pass through a country park uh  plover cove uh 
country park  further south back we will  visit the fishing village
""
it  ' s uh sha mun jai fishing village 
""
it  ' s a very  different from aberdeen 
""
have anyone of you gone to aberdeen  yeah 
""
aberdeen is also a fishing village but is now uh  develop into
an industrial and uh residential area  but uh sha mun jai still keep it as
a  uh fishing village so is more quite and uh peaceful 
""
and then we will have a visit to the shatin race course  and uh
have our lunch and uh back through the lion rock tunnel to ymca 
""
at at the back of the map  is uh what we are  going to have
uh  this afternoon 
""
if you don't like chinese food  you may also have a choice of uh
sandwich  or if  you don't like any meat you take you may take
vegetarians and uh later on i will ask uh about your choice  and i will
try to arrange with the uh restaurant 
""
our tour will last about uh  six hours so we will be back about
uh three o'clock uh in the afternoon 
""
this area is called uh yau ma tei  and uh we are doing a lot of
uh reclamation here  because uh we are going to build the new airport in
lantau island
""
and uh lantau island is the uh  largest outlying island in hong
kong 
""
and uh  we have a buddha monastery and the biggest outdoor
buddha there
""
anyone have visited the outdoor buddha 
""
no 
""
if you  want to pay a visit uh later on i i give you a sample of
the guidebook  uh telling you how to explore the lantau island by yourself
""
""
it  ' s uh very simple just take a ferry from uh central  and then
take a bus to po lin monastery  and the uh biggest buddha is just outside
the po lin monastery  and then you can compare po lin monastery with uh
chuk lam monastery today 
""
and the new airport  i  will be also built on the uh lantau
island on the northern  side of the lantau island  and then uh we have
a highway and also a airport railway  back to kowloon  and in here yau
ma tei we  we will have a  traffic exchange 
""
we will have a new cross harbour tunnel to the western side of hong
kong island  and also the airport railway will go  under the harbour to
central  so uh it will be a big project  and uh we hope to finish it by
uh nineteen ninety-seven  so uh you will see the reclamation start from
here 
""
originally uh this is the uh  ty  yau ma tei typhoon shelter
 but uh it is now relocated further out 
""
and you will see many cargo handling vessel there 
""
besides for the uh traffic exchange it also provide more land for
this uh part of kowloon 
""
if you  are going to visit hong kong again next time you may use
the uh new airport  anyone planning to visit hong kong again after ninety
seven yeah good 
""
because uh many people ask me  my opinion about uh ninety seven
i always answer them  it  ' s better for you to see the change  because
if even if i given you my opinion it  ' s only my opinion  because uh
everybody is hoping for the  bet  for the best and uh  we are only
guessing so it  ' s better for you to see the change
""
there  ' re some change so uh but but we don't we can't see  the
exact change  so better for you to come again
""
that there  ' s no problem for the uh new airport because it takes
you only twenty-three minutes from the new airport back to here  so it  ' s
also very convenient
""
because uh kai tak airport is uh too  close to the urban area
 so it  ' s no good to have the airport there 
""
this uh yau ma tei is a very uh interesting area  with a jade
market here  and uh also in the evening we have a temple street 
""
temple street is uh opened only in the evening from about uh six uh
six o'clock  so uh you may  pay a visit tonight  to the temple
street 
""
we have a lot of  uh different kinds of market here here in hong
kong the jade market the uh temple street and also uh stanley market
""
anyone visit stanley market yeah it  ' s a very interesting market
stanley market 
""
and also uh  we have a  the uh  ordinary markets uh for
the uh foods and uh  later on you will see a very interesting one  it  ' s
a temporary one
""
and uh nowadays uh we have uh some uh modernized uh complex  the
lower floors are for the uh markets and the upper floors are for other uses
""
so uh first of all you will try to look at the street  there  ' s
a lot of people gather there  next street you will see a lot of people
 gather there they actually it  ' s a temporary market 
""
people in uh other country may sometimes like to buy the things uh
 maybe once a week and keep it in the uh refrigerators  but uh here in
hong kong the housewife uh  like fresh food  they will go to the market
now and get the food  to prepare for the lunch  and uh in the afternoon
about four o'clock  they will go there again to get the food  to
prepare for the dinner 
""
and uh between this two time uh that is just like an ordinary
street  but uh they will gather together twice a day to form a temporary
market 
""
of course uh nowadays uh we have the modernised market  and the
upper floors are for the uh badminton court  uh squash court uh libraries
uh dancing rooms or gymnasium  to uh  uh the hong kong people  know
how to make use uh every space 
""
but uh luen wo market is uh always there  it  ' s the uh it  ' s now
the only  traditional chinese market in uh new territories
""
long time ago in new territories there are more than one of 
that kind of market but now we keep only keep uh luen wo market 
""
and also uh we we will uh we have uh  flea market uh in uh shek
kong 
""
later on we will pass through shek kong  and uh flea market is
only open on uh fridays friday morning because uh shek kong is quite  away
from the urban area to to form a special market every morning for the
soldiers 
""
later on the tape will tell you more about this uh shek kong army
camp 
""
we also have a flea market in uh repulse bay 
""
it  ' s open in uh saturday and sunday only 
""
uh this area is uh  tai kok tsui called tai kok tsui  uh this
flyover this side is uh very densely populated  but on the other side you
may find some uh industrial building  so they are too close together 
""
that  ' s why we have to develop some uh new towns for the industry
 and also for the people to live  especially in uh tai po we have a
very large area for the tai po industrial estate  break 
""
uh you see uh some high-rise building there those buildings are the
uh  houses uh public housing provided for the by the uh government  for
the low income people 
""
we have uh two main kind 
""
uh one is for rental 
""
the others uh will be sold to the uh low income people  at a
much lower price than the uh market price 
""
later on uh in a new town uh we will see a lot of this kind of uh
public housing
""
we have uh six million people and uh  more than half of the
population about three million live on public housing  so uh there  ' s no
problem for the people here in hong kong
""
but the private  housing is uh very expensive  uh  for
example the uh usual price is uh  uh maybe here  hong kong dollar five
thousand  per square foot  so i am standing on uh five thousand 
""
but uh but most uh low income people they they will get a house
from the uh government so there  ' s no problem 
""
of course uh if you want to invest you may buy one  uh for
yourself  break 
""
uh you see a  island there  and uh that is uh stonecutter
island
""
that  ' s the only island uh inside the victoria harbour but is no
longer an island now because of the reclamation  and we are going to build
a new container port there  so we can drive a car to the uh island 
""
so the number of island is uh  decreasing in hong kong 
because uh reclamation 
""
later we will see the uh kwai chung container port  and uh the
extension uh one more will be uh built in lan uh stonecutter island  and
the others are planning in uh tsing yi island and also lantau island 
""
somebody ask me where the lantau island is  later on uh in uh
 in tai mo shan outlook i will show you where it is but on this map you
will see part of the lantau island 
""
it it  ' s here  just a very small part  the whole  lan 
lantau island is uh  uh double the side of hong kong island 
""
that  ' s only the uh north eastern part of the uh lantau island 
""
here there is a lot of uh  hi  uh residential building here
""
""
it is a private housing
""
it is not public
""
it is private
""
it  ' s originally belong to the   mob  mobile oil company
but it  ' s now moved to tsing yi island and uh this is uh  re 
developed into a residential  areas
""
it may be a surprise to you that uh they are all together ninety
nine blocks  ninety nine blocks so we need some  space for  taking
 1 word  so there  ' s a swimming pool there and a sporting
centre  and also a chinese  1 word  there 
""
so this is the uh kwai chung container port 
""
it  ' s uh number one to uh seven here number eight uh in a some kind
of island  several words  
""
it handles uh more than uh nine million  standard  2
words  units  so it is the uh world busiest uh container port
 because uh we have uh great business with all the country all over the
world and also are re-entreport and and the uh goods from china we were 
to  1 word  hong kong as an entrepot
""
after passing through this uh kwai chung container port we are now
directing to uh tsuen wan and the tape will tell you more about uh this uh
first satellite town tsuen wan  long-break 
""
so uh we are now going to the uh chuk lam monastery
""
chuk lam means uh bamboo forest 
""
plenty of name uh here in hong kong is difficult for you to
understand because uh just translated from the chinese word so uh chuk lam
means uh bamboo forest  because a long time ago here is a just a bamboo
forest  and the monks and nuns uh find this a very good place to build a
monastery so uh in nineteen twenty seven  they uh start building uh this
monastery  but you will find the monastery still quite new
""
it  ' s quite new because uh most part was built in nineteen
eighties but they still keep a hall and that was built in nineteen twenty
seven
""
we have uh  uh half an hour stay here  and uh for the first
uh fifteen minutes i will try to explain the uh things to you and uh the
other fifteen minutes uh you will have time to take photos uh yourself
""
and if you want to take photo of the people the monks and nuns
there please ask for their permission first 
""
this is a very typical monastery so i try to uh explain to you the
uh technical things here so that you you may compare with the other monastery
here in hong kong
