maybe i can present my part first   you start first  yes   okay  okay sure uhm it is a book written by woodsworth and and and i just read the chapter uh about motives here    uh huh  this one  yeah but i haven't finished because i think there is other chapters which is relevant as well but i don't have the time to read it yet    uh huh  oh he wrote it  he wrote  yes yes so it and it ' s quite easy to read too  the english is e s is more simple than i think  because you know the book is like look   so old and i originally i think the one-word english  mus must be very complicated and old too but it ' s not the it ' s not the case    yeah   uhm   yeah  okay  you know first of all uhm uh to woodsworth motive is a power for actions and there is end uhm and it is pre-existing that means uhm uh it is present in the individuals he think  so i think it ' s it ' s kind of he treat it as kind of like uhm entity which possess by the  individuals  and he under understand behavior in terms of sor and o is the uhm characteristic of the individual so there he did have some uhm his stipulate stipulation about uh in internal mental state and later uh when when we uh go over     uhm   uh huh   wait wait motivation you mean  no no no it ' s the permanent characteristics of the individual of individuals and motive is only one of them    no   uh huh  right right right  you know  uh clears throat  and the to him there there are two kinds of motives the  instinctual motives and the learned motives and he think that uhm this is intertwined together in a sense that uh natural motives can be modified uh through learnings for example and it is in four ways uh the first is uhm these motives can be can become more specific through learning uh and this can com combine into more complex motives  and the third the the first one means that uhm for example sex instinct is inborn and instinctual right but uh it can modify and become more specific specific in a sense that for example some people like uh transvestites and some like homosexuality so it become more speci uh specific in the in the more general instinctual sex instinct so it it ' s kind of modify uh through learning   or maybe associations uh he did mentions pavlov ' s association and also the little albert do you remember    uh huh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  yeah  and the second he says motives are combine into more complex motives in a sense that uhm for example uh we do certain we do certain things our motive drives us to do certain things but uh the action itself maybe satisfied uh at same time different motives so it is it is combined already for example during uh eating it is uh satisfying the hunger as well as the s socialising uh motives of  human being uhm the the third uhm modification can be done through  uh in the sense that there are intermediate goals and and it is relative and  it ' s it ' s like uh we have some means to do an end for example we want to satisfy our uh pleasure needs so we earn money right but uh as time goes uhm uh at the steps uh of earning money goes we may lost our original goals and this means become  the motive itself  and that means for example in the case of earning money uh the money itself becomes originally it is money itself doesn't have any intrinsic  satisfying value right but as time goes it becomes uh satisfying as in in itself    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm  and the fourth characteristics is uh the new stimuli become associated with the motive and capable of arousing it to activity like uhm we we have the instinctual motive to escape from danger right    for example the uhm fire is dangerous to our to to us so we escape from it from it but uhm it can be paired like the pavlov  thinks for example we heard the alarm uh the fire drill in the fire drill we heard the alarm and then we will go for the alarm itself without seeing a fire or things like that  uhm and he and basically he has classified uh motives into different categories and it ' s just some categorization without  a lot of significance i think  $z laughs follows by that of $a  uh and and and he did mention that uhm motives is for survival so i think it ' s i think i think if it is compatible with  william james ' adaption theory because uhm because james did talk about adaptation right    uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  uh huh  so i don't know what if it is the com it is  comparable or not and also he he did talk about the strength of uh motivation and i think it ' s like educational psychology what is said in educational psychology that uhm there are different strength uh uhm our motivation to do certain things is a result of competition right between different things for example uh uh we we go to learn but at the same time we have the motivation to work but at the same at the same time uh we ' ve we may have the motivation to play as well but uh finally we do certain thing because the strength is different  and    uh huh   uhm uhm  intensity  yes you can say that  and also he he did mention about purpose because   uh motive is an although he ' s not a purposive psychology like tollman but uh he did mention about he mention about uhm the motives in satisfying certain things and actually the strength itself it reflects the effort or commitment about our towards certain action which is our purpose or our goal so our action is uh goal directed   as well    uh huh   laughs yeah   uh huh   uh huh  so so are we taking james ' w will you know  yeah actually   and then it isn't based on that isn't it  uhm   that ' s where we ' re supposed to start off with right  yes   but he cause he cause he went four words  uhm motivation is what woodsworth is yeah  in reference to james but but i don't know where  james ' motivations you know   uh where james talked about motivation   yeah how how does he talk about it  when you read when if we define motivation     two-words volition   where ' s volition i think it ' s     two-words will you know that ' s that ' s the will you know that you have and then just just uhm prove this person woodsworth i think you put it just in terms of the common language that we use now you know motivation  you mean uh james ' notion of will is equivalent to    yeah motivation   mo motivation   uh huh uh huh  like a drive and the needs you know  i think he elaborated further and then came up with the theory of motivation  driving will  see see see    reads-from-text  see that anticipatory cues is can be like uh  the stimulus   yeah yeah yeah it acts as if i don't know preparatory react reaction in drive states and the consummatory reaction  i think woodsworth uh concept of preparatory reaction is like uhm the motive is intrinsic is present already before any action so it ' s uhm it ' s a preparatory state and  you react when there is some stimulus act upon it    uhm uhm   uhm  it doesn't have to be internal  like here i mean that ' s what i read  uh huh    one-word reaction such as stalking a prey so you ' re ready to bark pounce onto the whatever the prey and then in the end the end result is you eat it up  you mean the mo the mo the motor action itself is a stimulus   yeah it four words   it ' s not the internal things   that ' s the reaction  but i don't ' know if he only meant external things but uh he can mean internal but he ' s talking about internal things as well  for the example he gives was you know it can be external as well well you can see  because when i read how the preparatory uh reaction on the motives actually uhm i was thinking about james react reactive re  reflex arc because uhm remember when a child saw the fire he had initially you can say that the withdrawal of his arm is because the heat of the fire and differ that the fact uh it burns    but initially he touch he go and touch it because it ' s he ' s out of curiosity    uh huh uh huh   uhm  yeah yeah yeah  so can we say that the curiosity is the motive for his actions   yeah yeah it is  yeah it is that ' s what made him go there in the first place but does james talk about it like that  yes i i remember dr blowers says about it   but i ' m not sure whether james says about it    laugh okay  oh yeah yeah hey you know in class yesterday uh he handed out this piece of paper  for everyone   yeah for second year four words  it ' s about all the courses listed and then which courses would you like to see nex offered next year  huh huh   and then  he ' s the course coordinator   i don't ' know he ' s just doing a survey he ' s just doing survey  uh huh   and then it ' s got uhm the compulsory courses right  yes   and then the  and there are six   b right yeah well there are seven or eight and then actually you don't have to do what compulsory is and what the non-compulsory  uhm uhm   you just choose any eight you want as a two-words   and then and then uhm  history and issues no one no one will choose it i think   oh i don't know but you know the the the the what elective courses yeah  yes   quite interesting courses  what they have offered   uh  what they have offered   uhm uhm what was it like actually it ' s not the ones that i ' ve ticked in i just ticked like health psychology and stress and management and then cross cultural psychology and also like adult aging and whatever is psychology   uhm uhm uhm uhm  because they have split uh the life span into different courses right  it but it ' s the list of every courses    one-word psychology   yeah yeah yeah yeah  yeah that the uhm department can offer you know and then they want to see the frequency of the highest number  four words people choose  is there any new courses which is different from ours   yeah  because cross cultural i already get it  three words     yeah  two words  engineering psychology but i don't think anyone would choose it  laughs  engineering psychology uh  i think it ' s uh i like industrial   uh huh  industrial psychology because in industrial psychology we have uhm  dr hui is teaching it right   uh huh  but to uh towards the end of the semester he has given some lectures to dr chau and he talks about engineering psychology   uh dr chau right right  two words that ' s what i was thinking it was dr chau ' s course but they didn't say which who was the teacher  because it ' s about how to you how to design the machines which fits to into humans ' kind of uh mental work and then    uhm  ai  uh no not ai ai is about how to make the machines functions like a  a human being right but it ' s like you know like a displace how is more i mean it ' s more compatible for human to use the machines how to design  design of the machines which fits into our  uhm you know con concept or perceptions or things like that  for example you u you use different colours for  different kind of control in pan in panel control things like that it ' s kind of technical and    alright   uh huh   uh huh   uhm uhm  yeah  boring i think  so when i when i read about it uh do you think there is anything compatible with what you ' ve read    it ' s true   sorry  oh what uhm what you ' ve done right  yeah   this one sor  yes i agree  i agree but and this because if even if it ' s just motive he talk of motives in relation to behavior and motive in relation to perception you know  it ' s so broad   you know it because  yeah because he has uh also talked about that motive cannot be observed but it can be it can only be only be inferred by the behaviour     uhm yeah   yeah yeah yeah  so what what aspects are we going to cover  are we just gonna one word and look at motivation in terms of behaviour like s s and r  actually we can extend it because julie says we don't have to   stick to it  uh yeah   stick to it    but i ' m just wondering it ' s it ' s very broad so which which  which one are we going to talk about  what are the choices we have   what are the choices  behaviour is a good choice don't you think both-laugh no isn't it easiest to talk about behavior you know  because you talk you can bring in pavlov you know  who else five words  the only i can think of uhm their common point is to talk about  i think he ' s uh more or less a functionalist as well because he  talks about process instead of uh content   uh huh  yeah  so in in what have you read uh what do you think is  the main point about  your book is wro wrote by who james   this is james so i don't really read it laughs  but i this one  i think there is one chapter on motivation if it ' s not written by him it ' s written by other people  about him   yeah about him  and there is one about the first one yeah perception and action the sor process  so that ' s what i wrote that ' s what i read  and also he had talked about the sensation   yes sensation one-word  yeah   but does that  how does that relate to james  we can we can we can talk about other ah area  in re in relation to james   yeah  and woodsworth talks about uh sensations uh it is sensation that motivate action right  and james is also uh talking about sensation because he has the s and r uhm no no s and m is uhm laughs the sensory the reflex arc the sensory and the motor things  so i think james is i think james uhm did think that uhm action comes from sensory stimulus    uhm uhm   uh huh  yeah  you know uhm we don't we don't really have to make comparisons do we  we don't have to make comparison because   two words because uhm     yeah we just making james as starting point of how  uhm woodsworth developed his ideas and how successful was he in developing his ideas  really   yeah  i was thinking the uh essay question is about how how woodsworth is influenced by james   yeah yeah yeah uh huh so in his work it ' ll you know it ' ll talk about james ' s influence you know we can figure out  so i guess that ' s the part where we ' re making a comparison but then how successful was his you know was his idea was  one-word   so you think the main purpose is on uh james   and     half  cos the question divided in two parts of  actually do you have the question  because julie ju  oh we ' re in the same tutorial    ah  yeah yeah  but julie hasn't really give us uhm very definite essay  question  we just say it  what do we need to put down in this in the essays    question yeah uh that tutorial she one word a hole in my file  tnn  anticipatory image we have the anticipatory set before we actually get the movement  he also talk about set i think     yeah yeah yeah  so i think that ' s that ' s fine  because it ' s i think it ' s because motive is primarily  uhm present   uh huh  a priori of the action so it is a set in the mind   right right  an entity in itselves  so it is as the same as james  james also says that   james said that yeah oh this is woodsworth yeah  yeah this is woodsworth     yeah yeah yeah  in what is in james ' s language   anticipatory image  yes  and he did talk about learning as well i think james   in a sense that uhm  the first time you know the first time uhm the child saw the fire and touch it and then withdraw but the next time when he saws it his reaction will be different because he has already got    yeah  he just exhausts it laughs  really both laugh     five words machine here  uh laughs i forgot what to say   when he sees it  well the next time he sees it   yeah  uhm   the fire right  yeah he won't he won't reach   reach out because he has the will go through the whole process of the experience the experience he had    and so that so there ' s     yeah yeah   yeah avoid the burning uh huh   uh huh   ur   but somebody says something different right  so is it learning   that is learning isn't it  but did he talk about it in terms of learning   three words  no no no   sorry   laughs he doesn't u use the word learning but     yeah so what does he  what is volition actually  cogni cognitive process     volition  i think volition is more to do with will   the will your  what you intend to do like an intention you know   uhm uhm  uhm   it that ' s not uh nothing concrete  yeah   but still that ' s several-words  you know what  what   something about cognitive science cognitive psychology  yesterday he talks about cognitive science   no  not yet   what did he talk about yesterday osgood a new character i ' ve got the notes and i ' ll photocopy for you yeah  uhm thank you   uhm osgood and some kind of you know it ' s kind of like personality something like you have uh dimensions you know good and bad and then you can select zero to seven  and then and you you rate people in terms of  di dimension the different dimension   uhm uhm  is it the psycho-matrix   evaluative and uhm you know like like strong and the   weak  and then you say what will you put the word friend in it and then they ' ll say oh very strong you know and then soft or hard you know    how do you define friend and then you rate you know like one to seven and then you you you rate friend as soft you know like number two number one like that   uhm uhm   uhm uhm
