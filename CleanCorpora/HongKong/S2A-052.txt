<I>
alright good afternoon uh welcome to town gas centre to our
cooking class
oh do you have the uh who who who were here last time 
only two of you
you are all here new so you are entitled to two 
demonstration two courses one this time and another will be next next
month so uhm you come again
uh every time you learn three dishes and the three dishes is chinese
food in chinese cooking only that uh written in english alright so you
know exactly what they are
and you find that as we choose the dishes we choose different
methods of cooking as well 
well let ' s check over the recipes see whether you have the same
as i do
one is called the fried beef with oyster sauce
it ' s a very common one so actually what we want to show you is
 in chinese cooking home style cooking it ' s always vegetable with meat
 alright so today we choose beef very common uh kind of meat that we
have at home and then we have vegetables
and vegetables now in the season is the choi sum 
so learn a bit of the cantonese choi sum alright
so beef and vege to cook together and we do the work of
stir frying so show you stir fry in cantonese they call chau 
 alright stir fry
so another one that we ' re going to do is stewed spare ribs with
potatoes alright 
so this one again is pork
pork again is a very common meat we use at home and in stewing
stewing today i show you is uhm i ' ll be using the earthenware
pot right
so earthenware pot it ' s a local chinese one you can also
have the japanese one nicer one taiwanese one as well same you do it the same
 that ' s stewed pork right so we ' re going to show you 
stewing in here
and then another one i ' m going to show you is steaming right
steaming the chinese way steam fish 2-words 
2-words is called waan yu so i show you later on
how they look like where can get it in the market right
so i ' ll be doing the beef and then i ' ll be doing the stew spare
ribs and the last one i ' ll be doing is steaming of fish the steaming of the
fish takes only about eight minutes right so very quick
so let ' s start with the several-words now
uh take a look at the fried beef with oyster sauce 
now fried beef with oyster sauce uh as you find in the recipe
we have five ounces of the beef fillet
now actually you can buy beef fillet from the local market from
the supermarket but normally when we go to the local market we don't call the
beef fillet we don't buy ngau nau that very often the two
chinese character there is called ngau nau alright
 ngau nau is really the fillet one long piece
but normally we buy ngau yuk right the meat and then we
tell them is chau stir frying alright so because stir frying
 need some tender cut so if you show them that we need it to stir fry they
will give you the cut of beef that is tender if you don't tell them they ' ll
give you just any other cut that it will be you will be in trouble
alright
so when you go to the local market either buy ngau nau
 or you buy ngau yuk for stir frying 
chau alright
so here it here it is so roughly about five ounces uhm
 i think if you go to the local market it takes about eight to ten dollars
 for something about that size right
so uh for family of four or even about five it should be enough
because apart from the meat itself you also got veges and also we
got two main three other dishes to go with rice right
so here you look at it that is the beef how are we going to cut the
beef
some people are lazy you ask the butcher that oh you help me to
cut the beef
sometimes they do it for you sometimes they don't so you have to
learn right
but when people get a piece of beef you find that there
are 1-word there ' re lines right
when you see the lines even with such a small piece i can see the
line running that way and that means i ' m going to cut across if you
cut along it it ' ll be tough because you don't cut up the fibers right
so the first thing to do is to turn the piece of meat and see how
the line goes when you see the line goes that way that means i ' m going to
cut it down cutting across the 1-word alright so cut
across the 1-word and then i ' m going to marinate
so one should know the where the 1-word lines
the second thing is i ' m going to cut
now this is a chopper that we use at home may be it looks a little
scary to start off with but once you get used to it it ' s a very very good
one
i use it for slicing i use it for chopping i use it for shredding
alright so ho this is how you ' re going to hold it
when you hold the chopper don't hold it like you are 
several-words it ' s very tiring here because 2-words
 heavy
so what we normally do is to grip the handle with the 
thre three fingers and then the two fingers standing in the position of
the blade
as we cut right this is more or less the the the the area that
we ' re going to cut seldom we cut on the top part because away from here
 you don't cut the beef nice nicely right so that is the way
where we to cut
now if you are going to slice the beef thin beef right that is
the way to do it then you are going to use it for stir frying not too
thick not too thin something about that size alright
so slice up all the five ounces of beef roughly about eight to
ten dollars of it 
and then the next thing you are going to do to ensure that you got
nice tender beef apart from buying the right cut you are going to add in the
seasoning
and you notice the seasoning there i ' ve written down all of
the five ounces of beef we start with something called the cooking soda so as
i finish up with my beef i ' m going to show you how i ' m going to
marinate them
so once you come to the very end sometime the beef doesn't look
very thick when you slice it it doesn't look like a ver very
neat piece
so what we ' re going to do we will do a cut what we call the
butterfly cut
may be from the camera alright you might see me cutting down a
piece don't cut through right this is one wing of the butterfly and
then we cut another piece down right through it and opening it out you
got a much larger surface that is what we call the butterfly cut
to cut off one wing of the butterfly and then another wing and
then you flat it
this is mostly done when you come to the end piece of the beef 
wher when you cut it ' s not a nice me decent meat pieces
alright
so here i ' m going to slice it off everything right
so once you got all the five ounces of meat ready alright you
are going to add in the seasoning okay here right
so that ' s supposed to be the seasoning for five ounces now you
notice that uh we got quite a number of you here i ' m going to do
double so everybody can taste 1-word later on
so when you got five ounces follow exactly as in the recipe
starting with a quarter teaspoon of you can call it the
 1-word soda i purposely reserve this 
1-word though it looks a little messy right because 
several-words soda you can call it cooking soda you can call it
baking soda it also used for baking you can call it 1-word
 soda right
and then what we ' re going to add in is if we have five ounces
you are going to add in a quarter level teaspoon you can add less but not
more than that otherwise it taste a little funny right
so when i add to my meat there i don't sprinkle you find me
whenever i add soda i measure level even less than what i mean is
alright put it by the side and the next thing i ' m going to add in 
hello take your place 
and the next thing i ' m going to add in is i ' m going to add in 
water so you notice the seasoning column i have one tablespoon of water
i ' m going to add it right in there mixing with the soda as
much as i can until they ' re well 1-word or dissolved
 alright because if you sprinkle the quantity of the soda on the
top of the beef because the soda will someway absorbed some inside
would not so you find some may be tender some may be not
those who absorb too much will taste a little bitter so the best
thing to do is to dissolve it as much in the water and then 
2-words alright
one should mix it take a look at the the water that all the
water disappear right i have two tablespoon because i got double
quantity but you don't find a single drop draining out
what happen to it it is absorbed inside the beef and it absorbed in
soda evenly as well
so whenever you use soda you do it my way which is a much
better way but mu much more uhm even way right
so you find nothing drains out okay and after that you can
simply add in the rest alright
so soda and water has been added in the next thing you find in
the seasoning column is that i ' ve got sugar right
so why do we add in sugar because we like to have a blended taste
alright and at home uh normally we don't add in too much of what we call
the msg 1-word alright so what to do is a pinch of
sugar to balance the taste out right so a quarter teaspoon of sugar half
the tablespoon of corn flour or corn starch whatever way you call it
i have double alright half a tablespoon and then i have
 half a tables three quarter tablespoon of the light soya sauce
right
light soya sauce how do you call it saan chau 
right and this is what we call the dark soya we call it the lou chau
 right
now how would you know the difference when you shake the bottle you
notice the colour stays there longer that is thicker and darker the
colour here is thinner alright and lighter then this is saan
chau 
 saan chau is more used for seasoning that
is more choose for colour or stewing right
so saan chau which is a three quarter tablespoon
for one portion three quarter tablespoon for my other portions it ' s
double alright and then i got oil or water is already in there you can
also add in a few shakes of pepper if you want to alright
so oil is about a tablespoon one for one portion that is
for my double alright
so everything is in there you mix
so you got a 1-word sugar a bit of soya sauce
and a bit of oil forming in nice and glossy because you notice when you
go to the local market to buy beef and vegetable to the uh
supermarket to buy rib eye you got no fat in alright
so add a bit of oil to make it nice and glossy and also the water
make it juicy later on right
adding up all the liquid there there should be about two to
three tablespoon of liquid but take a look nothing drains out the
reason for that is because several-words every single
piece of beef is nicely well seasoned okay right
so that is what we call the seasoning of the beef
now for beef you can season it well in advance may be for half
an hour an hour or even overnight 
now if you are going to marinate it overnight let ' s say you have
planned to do it tomorrow uhm guests coming you have to do some
preparation before you put into fridge one of the secret to keep in
the fridge to keep it nice and fresh is that have a little bit of oil 
like this on top and this little bit of oil you don't mix that is 
sits right on top of the beef and that some somewhat form a
covering right seals if off and then prevent it from drying and again
your 2-words your plaster wrap or your 1-word
 foil and the whole thing put into fridge
the next day when you take it out just stir and every single
piece of meat will be well used enough because of the oil that seeps through
it alright
so if you ' re going to leave overnight for hour or two 
morning till evening a little bit of oil on top alright so that ' s the
way to keep it okay
so that ' s my double portions of beef that i prepare same with
pork same with chicken it ' s only pork and chicken you don't add in soda
 beef we add in soda to make sure they ' re very nice and tender alright
so that is the marinating
