small depositors in bcc will get all their money back

more debate hong kong  ' s electoral system
""
""
good evening
""
thanks for joining us
""
no end to the impasse over the financing plans for the chek lap kok
airport
""
that  ' s despite a whole morning of discussion by the sino british
joint liaison group  ' s airport committee
""
another meeting is expected soon after the chinese side has
considered proposals put forward today by britain
""
neither side would say what the british proposals are but it  ' s
believed to concern financing arrangements for the future airport authority
which will handle the building and running of the airport itself  speech
by tony calsworthy jlg team leader 
""
the british side reportedly wants to resolve all the problems
involving the various airport projects as a package
""
the governor chris patten has said as much that he didn't want
residual fusses
""
but a chinese source said today the british proposal to the
committee did not contain concrete details
""
the chinese side is still worried about the government  ' s twenty
billion dollar  callable  equity
""
the future airport  ' s revenue especially where it involves
government taxes and airport franchises  speech by chinese team leader kwo
fung ming in mandarin 
""
chinese team leader kwo fung ming says both sides will continue
considering each other  ' s views and meet again in the near future
""
will the problems be resolved before british foreign minister
douglas hurd scheduled visit here next weekend  speech by tony calsworthy
""
""
the chinese side has also said they wanted the airport built on
time and has proposed that the site preparation contract be let out first
""
the provisional airport authority is to announce a final shortlist
of the bidders tomorrow aiming to let it out by september
""
but whether the successful bidder will trust the government to pay
for the contract without china  ' s approval of financing plans is uncertain
""
calsworthy  ' s said today there  ' s still a possibility of delays
""
legislator samuel wong however believes there  ' s still time
""
""
now the new method of reclamation it can certainly uh save
some time
""
and the maybe we wait for say uh october when we  re re 
when we meet again in the legco and vote for funding
""
""
legislator albert chan zero in on china  ' s hidden motives
""
""
but up till now the chinese government still haven't still
hasn't really come up with a concrete proposal regarding the  callable
 equity or the the uh cost of the airport railway
""
so uhm  it makes up  you know i mean  it makes one
suspect the the actual the motive of the china  ' s government in uh further
delaying the uh agreement on the airport financing plan
""
so that  i  if we further delay the overall cost of the
airport core project will go up definitely
""
""
calsworthy today also insisted that yesterday  ' s disclosure
of hong kong  ' s exchange fund was not tied to coincide with the jlg meeting
""
but he agreed with the financial secretary that it would help
prospective lenders for infrastructual projects
""
""
the government says the unemployment rate is dropping but
union says officials are hiding the real story
""
the last three months  '  seasonally adjusted figure showed two point
three percent of the workforce is out of a job
""
that  ' s point three percentage points lower than the figures
released a month ago
""
however the hong kong confederation of trade unions says later this
year eleven thousand foreign workers will flood the territory ready to accept
jobs at rock bottom wages
""
and that will drive more locals out of work
""
""
a scheme has been unveiled to pay small depositors in the
defunct bank of credit and commerce hong kong all the money they are owed
""
details were made public just the day before the first anniversary
of the government  ' s closure of the bank
""
depositors however are unhappy saying the scheme doesn't go far
enough
""
jeremy austin reports  report by jeremy austin with speeches by
nick etches bcc special manager and khanam noor shah from the bcc action
group respectively 
""
the financial secretary has welcomed the payment scheme
""
hamish macleod says it  ' s extremely rare in any bank liquidation
for small depositors to be repaid in full and so quickly
""
""
legco has voted down a proposal for an independent committee
to review functional constituency elections
""
peri chow reports
""
""
the call was made by frederick fung who thinks the practice of
returning candidates to legco by functional constituencies is a violation of
the bill of rights  speech by translator of fung  ' s speech 
""
emily lau wanted the government to take more drastic measures to
end what she calls an unfair system
""
""
it is organized in such a way that one man can have in
addition to his vote in the geographical constituency one or more votes in
one or more functional constituencies
""
through the system of having corporate voters or voters who are not
natural persons
""
this is a total perversion of one man one vote
""
so unlike mr k k fung i  subbord  i support the abolition of
the functional constituency system
""
""
while some legislators elected by functional constituencies
did agree there are room for improvement in existing system others simply
dismissed the suggestions  speech by translator of ngai shiu- kit  ' s (
legco member) speech 
""
in reply secretary for the constitutional affairs michael sze said
he didn't accept the accession  that the  bill of rights is being
violated but he agreed that the system could be improved
""
in the end frederick fung  ' s call was defeated by twenty seven to
twenty one votes with seven abstentions

the most contentious part of the debate on hong kong  ' s future
electoral system took place in the early hours of this morning
""
in an unprecedented overnight legco sitting liberals successfully
threw out the conservative proposal for a multi-seat single vote system
""
under the proposal voters would have gotten only one vote
regardless of the number of seats in their constituency
""
instead legco adopted a single vote single seat system
""
may wong wraps up last night  ' s debate  report by may wong with
speeches from ronald arculli ( legco member), jimmy mcgregor ( legco member)
""
""
""
clearly we will need to study all these with great care
together with any future public comments which we may receive in the next few
months
""
our goal surely is to identify the most equitable and practical
arrangements that will best serve the long term interests of hong kong 
report by may wong continues 
 
""
so i think this system has not yet earned wide spread support
among the hong kong people even among those legislators who supported this
one seat one vote system
""
i think many of them  uh supported it  out of expediency or
convenience for fear that if they don  ' s support it  the system of 
multi  multiple seats one vote introduced by the uh crc will be carried
through   report by may wong continues 
""
""
they they they couldn't get any support from the independence
""
and for the first time there were some appointed members voting
with us to defeat a proposal
""
now that was the only exception this year  report by may wong
continues 
""
""
after today legco breaks for its summer recess
""
with the introduction of directly elected members a lot of changes
occurred during the last session  one-word  of legco
""
tonight carmen luk takes us back to review some of the changes
""
""
legco is never the same again after the introduction of hong
kong  ' s directly elected legislature last september
""
close door meetings became open and gone are the days when a legco
sitting took just fifteen minutes
""
marathon question periods and debates many heated took some legco
meetings well past midnight
""
but legislators manage to pass a third  fewer  of those than
in the past legco session
""
""
 those  things have completely changed
""
we are no longer clearly no longer a rubberstamp
""
""
uh the system is is working uh
""
even though uh the efficiency may not be as as fast as what we
expected in the past but this is a normal evolution and i don't think we
should be alarmed
""
""
this new legco made history by forcing the government to amend
its budget
""
joseph cheng a founder member of lord wilson  ' s think tank says
hong kong civil service must adapt to change and make legco a partner in
government
""
""
since the nineteen ninety one elections the hong kong
government uh can no longer uh be certain that it has a majority support in
legco and it has to to rely on effective lobbying
""
there there  ' s no other way
""
""
with the arrival of the new governor legislators expect
further changes
""
""
he has uh brought in uh a breath of fresh air
""
perhaps breath of fresh air is an understatement
""
uhm i like to call him typhoon chris because he really brings in a
lot of changes to the administration and to the way uh civil servants are
dealing with the public
""
""
hong kong university senior lecturer owen wong says party
politics is still new to hong kong but he feels chris patten knows how to
play the game and balance power
""
by the next election in nineteen ninety five he says hong kong  ' s
legislature should become more efficient and mature
