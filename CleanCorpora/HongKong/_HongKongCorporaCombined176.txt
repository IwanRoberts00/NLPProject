the twelve of january or of uh which here write the minutes   because the last two meetings we are not really meetings one was the transcription section three words    two words   so we are the uh  the meeting of the twelve of uh january   uhm the end of twenty eight  for the uh another occasion several words  okay  now we we promise to let him take that i think so we have a meeting held on the twelve of january   and what about that  by the way uhm we will bring it up at about uh four the send is postage they ' re having a cold  yeah   uhm  so who ' s taking the minutes me oh okay on page one uhm at the bottom the very last line at that page should we also say to train modulators and page one yeah uh are we reading the same thing i don't   a minutes   a proper agenda   yeah student yeah  a minutes  yeah the very last line of this page  uhm  of page   yes to train to train interviewers uhm should it be modulators as well and the question is uhm did we say in uhm you know that ' s that ' s about student helpers it ' s not modulators number you you mean item number three no four the very last line oh that ' s uh that ' s   alright okay okay  oh okay so we got a different format  we got   one word  okay point four point four  yeah   number four alright  sorry  yeah point number four training of the interviewers should it be modulators too who when we say interviewers we need modulators actually okay now the question is uhm did we say in the plan uhm of our project that uhm the modulators or the interviewers should be  adults or  uh  adults yeah or i i sort of remember the word expert it ' s uhm i don't know   well we think expert is reserved for uhm other people uhm that we consult for the project people like doctor pennington  uhm   so my question is uhm if uhm ha so who are who who are going to be the interviews or modulators in the real tests  uhm  well at present we we we using ra and ourselves as  the modulators and also some student helpers for the junior form for for the junior level  so we have to discuss this i think uhm  yeah   and   some student helpers yeah yeah   yeah   yeah  is it any other points on the agenda  put the opposite   i get the feeling from from from the ras that they want us to use the news  you prefer i think you either you phone your  student and i give my my point of view  but  because our project that will one word  something it ' s uh   uhm uhm   yeah yeah well it ' s not that make because i i said did you remember and they don't only uh   because are two words   uh we were ask to sit as a interviewer just to get a few for example about what what the actual thing is like  live uhm yeah and that will be about uhm  if we are talking about three hundred speech samples three hundred subjects then there will be about hundred interviews and each one of us include uh seven of us there will be about fifteen interviews and each each of us will be sitting we have to think about the workload  uhm   uh  yes i know it ' s uhm a very large piece of forth work but the thing is i talk to eva yesterday on the phone and uhm uh uh both of us agree that uhm it would be much better for us to uhm do the interviews because uhm we we know very very well what what we are looking for and i don't know what what about the others what do you think yeah   well uhm   the answer the other think  well i think it ' s important i think a lot a lot of responsibilities been put on the ras   up till now  i think we need to to take responsibility for running it the point uh we can resure that we all know what we want it up  then it might be losing up so i think for for certainly the next period we need to be uh involve as much as possible i mean in in my si in my case because of not knowing about secondary school they were very informative and i would like to do form three and form five  for that very recent because i get as much better idea for the actual practical skill as well as they lost very simple technical thing which could be probably help so but uhm i can see it getting more spread around i think it ' s period when we do need to be because pro uh i would like to responsibility and then the period when we involve in because we will all participate enough to have feedback because it ' s the moment to speak coming from your side and so so now i think in fact that more of us have been involved is a good thing   uh i think   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   yeah that ' s exactly the the the next point that i want to raise uh is about the the ra duties it seems that we sort of raise that the issue one of the meeting but we we never solve it uh doris isn't here today uh i think he she was the one who raise it about the ra duties i see can i suggest to put bill uh that ' s one of the point oh a long pause  so so you ' re saying that you know we should do that we should do all the interviews  is that is that what you suggest to   no we should i i think it ' s practical uhm can we should do more like for us i don't mind doing it seems but seems that how you know the word implication for for uh you know for a full time jobs you know for our teaching you know yeah preparation and things like that  that ' s what that ' s what the two words   yeah i know but   the thing is   but i think we we can probably use in block i mean in a sense we shouldn't rush ahead in do  in a season all three hundred to get them i get we ' ve got uh this point we ' ve consolidating   in terms of both method and interviews technical problems and test  one word and the feedback and that so and so this is uh uh point to to think through what we ' re doing and then when we ' re ready for the next phrase and there will be a phrase uh south of the cross the different categories that we may not have them now uhm which is also will affect the methodology so i don't see it is three hundred as one job  i see it ' s breaking up into a series of target so we can say okay we need to make sure we got enough proper primary for example or different bands in form three so that we know whether they are lower form uh because a fact what we do later i think we don't the three hundred may not be the the sort of need object you may have at the very beginning it it will get modified because it goes along so i can see it in block i don't know uh well that ' s i think that ' s one of the things we need to work out it ' s what variables we are consciously taking in uh counting terms of types of schools that would be level and band  and if we would agree on that and have a simple strategy and say okay we need needs to school in each band at this level of the next stage and that will give us a target  and of course it ' s it is complicated to fit individual but it basically we should try to make sure that one of us gets into each of the categories is involved and then the follow up one is maybe not a critical i think you can say we ' ve been through that kind of school before uhm we we know what the problem alike that we it and and therefore we predict that lot of issues that need to be sort out beforehand so that we ' ve we try to take account of that so i can see it is uh uh it i think we can sort it out i mean what what well that ' s one well well  uhm   uhm   uhm   yes it ' s not a one job   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  yes i think  i think what we need is uh more detail to plan on what kind of job we are going to do for the next few months and what are we going to do in the summer before people go out for their holiday  and uh   several words   i think we have im implementation plan right from the beginning and uh just recently look at it again and we are far behind and that one worries is that we won't be able to finish it in time and and money will be taken back by the uh uh ugc what uhm well of course this is a very practical issue and and now it ' s uhm  if we uhm take the samples and not uhm for longer strict of time then we have to justify alright  uhm i agree with robert in in that uhm we have to modify our strategies we have to look at what we are looking for uhm we have to pause and then work in progress and then working in now it seems that the pilots are giving us a very clear indications what we should be looking for uhm in the uhm next block of work we use uhm robert ' s term block and uhm right now i think we are at the stage where we have to look at the levels and the kinds of students that we ' ve been tackling and what else we don't know about the lager sample out there i think we we are going to look at that and in on on item number  two actually  so we we will save this discussion for item number two okay any other points about the minutes that we we have to talk about a long pause  if not then we will move into item two item two we have on the table in front of us report of pilot test table of summary which are two copies of these three tables uh the first first one is uhm i mean we have some primary school as well as don't we seems that from   yeah   but   yes yes   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uh   uh   this is dynamic for the   this is the second one for this   yeah   uh it  this is the second round so we have to put both in it so we get a  better picture of what we ' ve got alright but then anyway so here we have got uhm have we got the bands here for the schools  yeah yeah  the first one is uhm the band five school from   okay cf is band five yeah kowloon tong is band three   kowloon tong is band three   it is one word schools are band three  yeah that ' s right   yeah band three   uhm uhm so we ' ve got uhm two schools at the moment  they ' ve got a three five seven what we haven't got is actually a band one in our case the two and four are in between believe that not very significant but we remember we have got st. francis uh sissy which is a band two school  alright band one or two what ' s the one was the band one we for the primary we have had st. joseph and heep woh which is a band one or the top range top range and then we have we have had island from island road or whatever which is a band uh which is one of the of the scale what we lack is the middle one in between so the next one we ' ll look at is the middle one i think we we up to the point where we can't say whe  whether it is pilot or not because now we know what we ' ve to control and we are up  there to look at uhm the the the real situation  uhm the one word are  basically solved at the moment like uhm the setting up of the room uhm the link of the interviews and and things like that i think we ' ll we ' ll tell we have to say how many speeches are go how many subjects are we going to to to tackle and what level and which plans do i i will sugg suggest from this table from that we will look for band one secondary school and we can't have five and seven at the moment but as i ' ve talked to the ra before they they four and the six are very close to five and seven because uhm  uhm   uhm   yeah   yeah   island   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah we may as well two words  form four form six   yeah  by this stage by by by now because the form five students in september will be poorer than a form four student in uh march because he he he would have lost so much of his english during the summer vacation unless he ' s into private tuition or whatever uhm otherwise i think they they they are rather similar in terms of the link of english tuition they they have received so i think we we ' ll have to look at two four and six i i believe  yeah   what doing two words   uhm
