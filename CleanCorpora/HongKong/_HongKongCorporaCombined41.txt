but uh how do you feel about uh uh your school life after you have promoted to lower six   uhm i like the school very much and i think uhm one has to work much harder now  uhm whereas before uhm you can more relax than not so much homework and now you have to work all the time    we get more free time now and i feel kind of grown-up maybe  uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm  really   yeah both laughed  we are treated like adults   yeah and the one-word   treated by by   the teachers  by the teachers   yeah and even though laughed it ' s kind still the same but we are kind of given more freedom uhm uhm now we kind of specify in our subjects which i do like you know doing because uhm i don't really like history and you know geography and those lots uhm so i can kind of like really do my own subject   yes   uhm uhm  $a laughed  uh uh then what kinds of freedom do you think that you have  that you you haven't have before or you have now   uhm well in the school side we are now able to go downtown and kind of enjoying the day uhm you just have to sign up  you are not allowed to do in lower forms   uh uhm not before  no we ' ve we had to stay in school during school time but now when you have free time or lunch hour  or even break time you can go down and kind of get some drinks or  or maybe food or meet or meet some friends uh from other schools   uhm   uh uh   uh uh  do you find this ins interesting   uhm personally not so interesting because i don't really go downtown but uhm but many of my friends do go and meet friends  other friends you know    $a laughed   uh uh  and what other kinds of freedom do you think you have now   uhm well in the boarding house we get more freedom    uhm before we couldn't kind of like locked up in the prison   in a way uhm because we were kind of young and it ' s not it ' s considered to be dangerous to go out you know  on your own but now we are a kind of grown-up and we can go down town on our own and we can go to the cinema at night and even go to kind of pubs  three words  i i don't really go but   uh uh   uhm uh   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh  $a laughed  you don't go to cinema even   yes cinema not so much because quite expensive  uh uh   uhm what i tend to do is kind of uhm maybe go downtown   in the in the morning with my friends and see you know clothes and shops and see what ' s new  uhm   uh uh  and and uh you you uh you have specified in in some some subjects you have said that  yes     yes  uhm i do physics chemistry maths  i did do music before but now i think i will give it up because i don't really like the teacher even though she ' s a very nice person   uh uh  but you are interested in the subject   yes very much so yes especially chemistry  but now a a-level is really hard i find  uhm it ' s not so straightforward you know before they just tell you that ' s it  and you are a kind of like you know f face it that ' s it but now you have to understand it and see how and why and you know kind of being more informed in the subject   uh uh   uh uh yeah i think so   uh uh   uh uh   yeah   uh uh  yeah you have to pay more effort in thinking about the subjects yes i i have passed the advanced level i think it ' s really hard   yeah i agree both laughed  i have to to to read inches inches of notes before the examination and and the notes doesn't tell you how to how to prepare the exam  but but you have to prepare yourself you have to think about uh what do the examination would ask it is not so straightforward as as in the   the form five level or or what two words      yeah   yes   i agree yes   we call it the fifth form  fifth form yes   tis uh examination is called     yes   is called gcse  gcse i see  then then how about the advanced level examination    yeah  i think it ' s quite similar to the one in hong kong but i ' m not too sure  but what i what it is called then     it ' s called a-level  a-level yes the same as hong kong     yes yes the same yes  uhm uhm uhm uhm then uh would the questions uh similar to that the hong kong   i would have thought so yes but people some people say that uhm uhm science in hong kong is much more difficult than it is in england    and that perhaps maths is even more difficult than  in england whereas like english is easier in hong kong than it is in england which one would have expected anyway  uhm so now that i am doing kind of science and mathematics  in uh in england i feel that perhaps i ' m not so clever as many others in hong kong   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uhm  uh uh uh uh no both laughed  then then what do you do in your leisure time   in in my leisure uhm i like to play the piano  i practise quite often now that i ' ve passed my grade seven   uh uh grade seven  but what a pity you didn't take the music subject    yeah i  yeah it ' s a pity but i still carry on with my piano i think    i also play the viola even though i don't practise both laughed to be honest uhm whereas on the piano i ' ve practised kind of like uhm usually about at least an hour a day   uh uh  uh uh uh uh you are very hardworking    both laughed  no not really so i have to spend quite a lot of time on it    i also like to read uhm not so much as chinese fiction but english novels like uhm maybe pride and prejudice   i like lots of novels from uhm jane austen  she is a great great writer   uh uh   uhm   uh uh   yeah three words  do you read uh sense and sensibility   yes i ' ve read it  yes   yes it ' s good   it ' s good both laughed  even though the language is a bit difficult to understand but the story outline and the kind of sense of humour in some of it  is quite interesting   uh uh  but you didn't take the english literature this year   i did and i did i did and i got a c   you did uh uh uh  uh uh i i mean in lower six   in lower six uhm no no i don't think so it would be rather difficult i think  well usually you take the subjects that you think you are best at   and if i have if i do english literature i have to kind of deal with other english girls who are really good at it   so  $b laughed   uh uh   yeah   uh uh   uh uh  you are interested in it but not take it as as a subject    yes  yes that ' s right  yes    $a laughed  then uh when will you come back to return to england   uhm i shall go back uhm on the tenth of january  tenth   uh uh uh uh     yes and school starts at on the twelfth i think    yes   uhm uhm you have a lot of homework to do do you bring your homework to hong kong to do   yes i do bring it but three words     five words  do you   uhm in chemistry yes the teacher is very very hard and she gives you kind of like loads of homework  it ' s really scary uhm not so much in other subjects  i ' ve got my math exam which is an a-level   exam  uhm it ' s kind of like we do modules and it ' s one of it and it ' s in january when we come back i think it ' s the next week that we ' ve after we ' ve come back   i ' m not so worried about it because this is p one and it ' s kind of like the easiest uhm among the most others yes  uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh  uhm  $a laughed  yes do you plan plan to uh return to hon hong kong to further your studies at the university level   uhm i ' m not too sure at the moment but i think uhm what i would do is to apply both universities in england and universities from hong kong  so i get kind of like both chance  uhm i ' d very much like to stay in england uhm at you know for university but on the other hand i would very much like to come back to hong kong to work so it ' s kind of like now i don't really know where to go at the moment  my parents would like me to come back because they want to see me more often uhm but whereas my point of view is i like the educational system in england uhm and also i think i ' m more used to that system   and i would kind of maybe do better at that system  whereas hong kong i get the impression that people kind of just work and both laughed kind of like non-stop and it ' s quite scary   uh uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm   yeah  but uh it ' s i i think it ' s not so pre pressing no no not so uh tense at the university level  yeah it ' s it ' s more relaxing and you you uh whether you work hard or not you can it ' s depend very much on on how how    yes   uhm  how well you want to do yes   yeah yeah  how how do you think about your work you think uh you are good enough then you you can pay less effort in it  but if you want to get a better degree you have to work hard really    yes  yes well when i whenever i come back to home on holidays i can never work you know as much as i would like to work because there is kind of like cinemas cinemas kind of televisions and i don't pay so much attention in my work  and even though i ' m kind of like i work in my room  uhm my sister four words  she is just four years old and she kind of like knocked on door and say have you finished you know every kind of every five minutes or so uhm so i think i ' ll be better off if i am not in hong  kong to work   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   your little sister one-word laughter    uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm  but you you can live in a hostel in hong kong not not exactly a hostel   a boarding kind of school   yeah  we we call hall   hall oh yes school hall  yes school hall   yes uhm yeah that would be a good idea but then it ' s quite also quite expensive i think isn't it   no no it ' s not quite expensive but at the same time you you have to uh take part in some activities ho   held by the school hall  if you want to live in there then you you have to  $a laughed spend more time on the activities then    yeah   i see   yes   yes spend more time yes yes  yes two words i see then that would uh  take my time off i suppose  yeah   yeah that ' s quite a good idea i must consider that  you seems quiet you you did you take part in any school activities in england   uhm  yes i do i i sing in a choir well i used to sing in a choir and i uhm play the viola in the orchestra and we have to practise kind of  uhm once a week for an hour  uhm i also like go you know like swimming we ' ve got a indoor swimming pool it ' s really nice and it ' s kind of warm even in the winter  uhm and i tend to go swimming quite often i suppose  uhm i suppose i also play chess   i ' m in the school chess club and i know i used to play bridge uhm but the teacher who taught us bridge has gone and he has left the school so there isn't the club any more  but i would very much like carry you know carry on with that  game   uh   uh uh   uh uh   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  yeah whe where do you go when you when you go to swimming   where do i go  yeah   uhm there is a swimming pool   swimming pools or beaches   uh swimming pool yes in the school  it ' s different from hong kong   oh very much so  yeah   yes uhm i mean it ' s so cold in england  $a laughed that i mean it rained  you you can never go to a beach   yeah it ' s kind of like rain every day and when it stops raining it ' s the summer and i come back to  hong kong so i don't really get the chance to go to the beach   you know and swim   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh  how about in the summer vacation you you you   i come back to hong kong you know come back home or else it ' s exams  then then you can go to swimming in to  the beach    yes  yeah  uh uh   yes  i used to like going to the beaches you know when  i was young  and kind of like make sand castles and collect sea shells  and et cetera   uh uh   uh uh  but the beaches are are are   polluted  yeah and uh very disappointing if if you go to see see the beaches  it ' s really terrible    yes   yes kind of  it ' s a kind of like rubbish everywhere  yeah when when i was young i do find the beaches are very beautiful and the water is very pure and very good but now it ' s when when when you jump into the water in the beach uh then you you come out you can find there is a film of oil  on on your body    yes  yes i i understand both laughed    quite provoking actually   do do you go go to the beaches in hong kong last summer   uhm no i no i don't now because since kind of as you said it ' s so polluted i tend to go to the swimming pool   more often  yes uhm   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh  are you not afraid of uh the coming of nineteen ninety-seven if you if you come back to hong kong to further your study or or you come to hong kong to work   am i worried or  yeah   no not worried at all i think i ' ll definitely come back to work  why   why uhm because  i think many people like you would would would prefer to stay in in england rather than go go back to hong kong to work   i don't think that ' s me i prefer to work in hong kong because kind of like my own country and my own people  i very much like to kind of just play a part you  know in the improvement of the country or something   uh uh   uh uh uh uh   uh uh  uh uh uh uh   yeah i don't i don't i think unemployment in england is getting really serious now and many you know graduates are kind of getting no job    uhm so i don't think i ' ll be able to get a decent job in england   uh uh uh uh  uhm uhm uhm uhm   so uhm i think and i think hong kong stands a better chance for me to work   uhm uhm  in in fact how do the english think about the coming of nineteen ninety-seven   many of them are really worried like my guardians who are who lived in hong kong for twelve years and they are now retired they are kind of especially my female guardian  she is really worried and she kind of like uhm really afraid where but i don't think there is anything to be afraid of   uh   uh uh   uh uh  why   why uhm  do you think there are too many differences between the chinese in mainland and the chinese in hong kong   i think there is probably a bit of difference but after all we are the same i think  maybe uhm in hong kong the people are kind of more  materialized kind of like  they kind of everything ' s got to have labels designs   and whereas the people in mainland china are more concerned with practical use maybe   uh uh uh uh   yeah   uh uh   uh uh  i i i don't know   you know uhm they are kind of like uhm it ' s got to be practical rather than kind of the label   uhm uhm  uhm uhm uhm uhm  then how about the english your your english friends or schoolmates how do they think about nineteen ninety-seven     i don't think i don't think they think of much about it in the least   uh uh but you you have you have said that to last summer is it you you have said that uh you have your school has held a discussion or your class about  nineteen ninety seven then i i i ' m curious and i ' m very interested in knowing about how do they think    uhm   yes   yes  uhm i think many don't really know what is it what it is about and they ge often get the year wrong   and some i mean if you ask younger ones they ask and they probably ask you where is hong kong anyway and some  uhm   uh uh   uh  $a laughed  really   yes truly and i mean some even don't know where japan is and one asked me whether japan was next to australia two words    but i i used to think most of the english would know about hong kong because this is their colony   i suppose so a bit too yeah maybe  kind of like twelve or thirteen or fourteen  but uhm some of my friends are quite worried but then i tell them there is one-word nothing to worry and  i suppose they believe me and so they ' re not so concerned now    uhm yeah they tend to ask me quite a lot of questions and  sometimes i don't even know how to answer it because it ' s quite politic you know political and i don't really quite understand it to be honest  uhm yeah they i suppose they are quite worried about me they keep asking me whether i ' m going to stay in england and when i tell them i ' m not they are quite surprised and say you know asked why and so on just like what you did   uhm i suppose they are no way quite concerned   on the subject but they are but not as concerned as kind of they would uh not eat or anything  they just kind of like on the back of their minds not really too worried   uh uh uh uh   uh uh uh uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh uh   uhm uhm  $a laughed   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uhm yeah  uhm uhm or or they may concern more about their internal problems have you have said that the u unemployment problem   is quite serious    yes  yes  uh uh   uhm yeah the un unemployment is really quite getting quite serious and many people are getting no job  uhm because they kind of get the really good benefits   from the government  and i think one of the cause one of the cause of get of this situation is that people young you know young uhm couples are getting  pregnant  i mean the woman is getting kind of getting pregnant too early maybe and sometimes they can't decide whether to want you know want the baby or not and  many of them are really young like fourteen and even thirteen   and i mean they ' re still in at school  and so uhm what they do some what some of them do is kind of like  uhm live together and get money from the government  and i think they get about ninety pounds for uhm every week   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh uh uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm   oh   uh  every week   yeah that ' s about one thousand dollars i guess  one thousand dollar every week    yes   but it ' s really good   it ' s really good yeah but they complain you know  if you don't work i think it ' s really good   yeah  you have one thousand dollars as a week   yeah  uh uh  yes do you do you travel to other countries in europe   uhm yes i did uhm i went to uhm france holland with my parents  uh my parents came over from hong kong uh   uhm uhm  to visit you   yeah to visit me and then we went to holland together   because my father ' s got a friend who lives in holland and we stayed there for a week or so and then we kind of drove  down to paris and stayed there for about three days it ' s great and it was really romantic as people said in paris but it was quite dirty  it was quite dirty kind of like   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   really  dirty   dirty yeah kind of rubbish everywhere  well not so exaggerated i suppose    uhm and al i also went to germany it was a german exchange and i went to stay with a family for two weeks and then she uhm on the other hand came over to england to stay with me for two weeks  i had great time in germany i saw lots of things i went to hamburg uhm but i stayed in uhm  one word which is north germany  north-west germany uhm it was the weather was much better than it is in england i mean it ' s kind of like sunshine for most of the time whereas england it rains all the time i think uhm i ' ve also uhm been to belgium  uhm it was a nice country but i most of all i i think i prefer holland and germany  it ' s kind of very very flat unbelievably flat and it ' s kind of no hills you could see kind of no hills at all and it ' s a very beautiful country both of them are   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   yes   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uh did you communicate with with uh the household in german   yes i did  one-word well   or in english  do they know english really    well  they did know one-word yeah they they know knew english much better than my german both laughed  and most of the time i communicate with them in english   rather than in german uhm but i did speak you know some german  and it was i suppose quite useful and i suppose in many ways it helped my german and it was a very good experience i thought   and the house they had was kind of really huge i think   you know in comparison with normal uhm normal  family in hong kong  uhm they had three floors and also a basement and then on the basement they had ta you know table-tennis room and also a sauna room   a mini sauna room uhm it ' s very very very lovely  i really enjoy my two-words   uh uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  many of my schoolmates have uh have gone to europe uh this summer vacation uh the past summer vacation yes they they found europe uh a very uh    yes  attractive  yeah very attractive and worth worthwhile to to pay a visit yes but i i haven't saved enough money to go with them   what a shame  yeah really what a pity   maybe next time  yeah they they had take some photographs uh and they showed to me and i i think uh it ' s very beautiful yeah my sister have have uh have gone to europe for uh uh for about three months or or or or more yes she have go to uh the eastern europe the western europe and uh except i i think except english she have visited more most of europe   i see yes   yeah  it ' s before uh eight yeah    is it the train so they can  travel kind of like everywhere   yeah   yeah  it ' s before uh nineteen eighty nine yeah  that ' s just before the uh the re   reforms yeah before before the reforms of the eastern europe yeah  most most of them are still uh were still uh communist   countries and and their living standards are are really low    yes   oh i see   yes i see   yes  yes  uhm uhm uhm uhm  two-words how about the the living standard in england do you find it ' s it ' s high or   uhm i think the part that live in is kind of like a countryside area  uhm so i think i mean people kind of tend to be more relaxed and this i think the standard is  i suppose the living standard is quite in a way quite i s i suppose depend which way you look at it    it can quite low or it can be quite high  uhm i mean people have got tend to have houses  rather than flats like they do in hong kong   and they you don't get so much new things coming in because it ' s such a long way from london  uhm it ' s i think it ' s just totally different so i don't it ' s difficult to compare the standard i think   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  yeah  then how about the necessities there uh do they the prices of them  how about the prices of them   uhm  i i mean the like uh detergents  $a laughed     okay i see i see yes detergents  something like that   yes uhm  shampoo   i think the chocolate definitely is cheaper in eng in england and also uhm dm boots you know doctor martens  you know things like that and but   uh uh   uh uh  next time  $z laughed i i ask you to to buy a pair for me    yeah  sure  sure   yes uhm but the uhm the choice is limited it ' s not so much so much styles  it ' s a kind of like fixed that   that type uhm but other things it used to be much more expensive than it is in hong kong when i first went there but now the standard of living in hong kong is so high   that the prices kind of just so similar  and maybe sometimes i tend to get things in england   and bring it back to hong kong because it ' s cheaper there  uhm maybe uhm uh pasta milk and those kinds of stuff are cheaper cheese and those lots   because there ' re more cows there both laughed  uhm   uh   uh uh   yeah   uhm uh uh   uhm   uhm uhm   uh uh uh uh   uh uh   yeah   uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm   yeah   one word you you have said that the stationery in england uh is uh is uh expensive yeah   yes but i suppose in com it it is expensive but in comparison with england it ' s not so expensive i guess   because uhm uhm i don't know everything kind of in england seems to me is more expensive yet in reality it may not be maybe i just got that impression when i first went that everything there is kind of expensive that ' s why but uhm in stationery and writing papers like that   things like that you get more choice in hong kong because they are mostly from japan aren't they  whereas in england they are mostly from their own country   and it ' s not kind of like you don't get lots of different  styles like pencils you don't get kind of mixture of colours   you only get kind of like either green or blue usually    yes   uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm pause and both laughed  uh don't you worry about that when you come back to hong kong uh you may not so uh uh  you can you you should adjust to yourself to to the lifestyle in hong kong because i think it ' s more more busy or more more fast  yeah do do you worry about this    yeah  yes i do worry a little but but i think i ' m prepared to  kind of settle down in hong kong again  because if i could settle down in england when i was just eleven i ' m sure i could do the same thing   and come back to hong kong  i mean after all i come back quite often about twice a year   and and i can feel the fast moving you know the action is really fast and i think i like it more   than in england  what i think i would do is kind of like work in hong kong or even in china i think then maybe when i retire i go back to mainland china   i i like the atmosphere is kind of quiet   uh uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  $a laughed   uh uh  have you visited uh to mainland china    uhm  no i haven't visited as such but i ' ve seen kind of like videos  and tapes and it ' s so kind of relaxing   yeah  uhm uhm you haven't vis visit mainland before   uhm yes i have visited the cities of china   uh only the cities   yeah but not country as such  i ' ve visited uhm one-word and  one-word  uhm the zoo and the wildlife  zoo wildlife zoo  uhm the miniature and things like that   uh uh   uhm uhm   uh uh   yeah   uhm uhm  this is a great difference between the north uh northern part of china and the southern part of china is i have visited  the north-eastern part of china yeah it ' s it ' s really what what you say like a countryside the people are uh uh are riding horses they they haven't much cars i i think it ' s i ' ve seen few cars uh except in beijing uh uh i have vi visited uh mongo mongolia is it mongolia yes  yeah and and even uh even northern than mongolia near near the yeah near the frontier of russia yeah so it ' s really different    yes   oh i see yes   yes   really  did you did you like the trip yes  yeah i i like the trip because you have seen something that  you can't  you have i have never seen and you you could never seen uh see in hong kong like a large pieces of grassland that you you can't see the limit  yes and and it ' s really impressing and a very large river  what what you saw what you see in hong kong a river is just like streams yeah a stream or a a pool of water yeah but they ' re very large and uh yeah it ' s really impressing yeah    you can't see   yes   yes   yeah  yes i would very much like to go i think but uhm i was going to go intended to go to beijing this christmas but uhm   uhm uhm  it ' s it ' s a new place yeah    yes  i think we go later on not so not quite ready yet   uhm uhm  uhm uhm uhm uhm what what about uh you you stay for uh how long do you stay in beijing   uhm i would like to stay for about two weeks  i guess  yes   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm  i i have gone to beijing before but uh i ' ve only just passed it because we we uh    oh i see  you had to go somewhere else   yeah yeah  i have to go to the northern part we have to take a train  in beijing     oh i see  yeah i take a uh yeah it ' s a difficult trip i i take a uh ship in hong kong to go to yes the jetfoil the jetfoil to uh to uh guangzhou a place in guangzhou i don't really what i i can't really remember what what el where it is or what what its name and then we i take a plane to beijing and then uh i  rest for a few days i i think two or three and then i take a train to the northern part of uh of china because you can't take a such a uh long way train from hong kong to the northern part of to    no no i see yes  i see how old were you when you  uh how old uh before uh before i enter the university  yeah    oh i see  i think eighteen eighteen or nineteen yeah eighteen yeah    do you go i see  do you go with some friends  yes i go with uh one two three yeah uh four three four uh they are boys   i see  uh because i can't i can't find uh some   girls  yes yeah there are because many of my uh girl friends they go to uh work in summer   oh i see  yeah they they get summer jobs then and they don't want to uh   yes i see spend their money both laughed yes i ' d very much like to do the same  i like to travel uhm and see other parts of the uhm other parts of the world  and i think one gains quite a lot by seeing different things  uhm uhm   uh uh   uh uh  uh uh uh uh uh uh yes but i don't like to visit to the southern part of china   you don't  yeah because it ' s too confusing   yeah  it ' s it ' s like a mess    uhm   yes  yes  there ' s many many uh you don't you you don't uh except yes we we find some beggars in beijing but in other parts uh of uh in the northern part of china uh we don't uh really see any beggars in fact uh but you in guangzhou you see many beggars in the  in the streets  i think uh the living standard in guangzhou is better but you find beggars in there but you can't find in the northern part of china it ' s really    uhm   i see  i see  ironical   yes both laughed  yes i have a relative in england uh she studies in form six in lower six too and she take chinese do you take the uh the chinese subject   uhm i did for gcse and it was quite easy because it was supposed to be for foreigners  i mean for the english people   uh uh  then you take the advantage     take the advantage  but now i think for a levels i think i will take it  because if i think i ' m prepared but uhm  yes but it ' s much harder even though it ' s supposed to be for foreigners  i have kind of left uhm primary school  and i ' ve uhm haven't really had any chinese lessons since i was kind of eleven and so i ' m quite worried i ' m i ' ve forgotten many many words   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   yes  the letter you have written to me you have many wrong words  both laughed    yeah yeah uhm so i ' m quite worried in a way but then my spoken chinese is all right because i come back and speak quite a lot   but my written is quite terrible i suppose uhm my parents told me that i often write the wrong wrong   word with the same syllable yes   uh uh   uh uh   yeah with the same sy yeah  same pronunciation yes  yes i i see i see both laughed     yes  so so uh do you find the uh chinese subject difficult in in lower six form   yes we we we don't have teachers   what one-word is really about   uhm it ' s about uhm the ching dynasty  the ching dynasty   and we have to kind of translate things to uhm   it ' s chinese history or uh     chinese history yes   or chinese language   i think it ' s the history well it ' s both parts there are two papers  one is concerned with the history of china   and the other part is kind of like translation you have to translate from english to chinese and then from chinese to english et cetera so it ' s both skills it ' s the lit uhm the history as well as the language  i suppose with the history one can kind of learn   and kind of read more  but with the language it ' s quite difficult i think   because i don't see much uhm chinese uhm language like newspapers  and i don't get it in in england i think it might be a good idea to read readers ' digest   because they have both versions  yes and then you can compare and see how they do it   and maybe follow   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh   uhm uhm   uh uh   uh uh   uhm   uhm uhm   three words   uhm uhm uhm uhm  uhm uhm  then you read when you read the books do you find one some words that you haven't learnt or you you don't know     oh yes   there are many times   then how then what what would you do   uhm first of all i don't read many but if i see words i don't know i usually ask my grandfather uhm when i ' m in hong kong of course  and i ask my grandfather he uhm he knows everything to me kind of like   uh uh   uh   whe when you are in england what what would you do   uhm i ask my other chinese friends  i mean they know much better than i do i think  will you check up in the chinese dictionary   i haven't got one but  uhm i haven't actually got one that so i usually ask other friends  uhm yes i usually ask my other friends and they usually know better than me because i i am the the first one that went to that school in in in my one-word yes    uhm uhm uhm   uhm uhm   they enter in in in higher forms   yes in my lot and they know uhm better than me because they ' ve been educated uhm in the secondary school in  england i mean in ch hong kong so they probably know better   uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm  yes yes one of my friends said that it ' s it ' s quite easy to take the chinese subject in the lower six uh he he uh he came to england to study for the for uh the lower six and upper six  after that then he he come back to hong kong uh in in the university  he find yes he find the subjects are easier    oh i see   he come back yes   yeah then he yes easy  yes two words i thought so yeah because  he ' s been he knows the history of probably of you know china and et cetera  yes uhm yes the problem with me is that we don't ac  actually have a teacher that teaches chinese in the school so   he finds the subjects are easier uhm uhm uhm uhm  then   you have to pretty much work on your own  who who teaches you about chinese   nobody actually  no teacher is in charge of the subject   no so it ' s really then you you either take it or not    then you have you any less lessons on it   no i haven't that ' s why i ask you actually   you have no lessons then you have to prepare by yourself all the things  uhm uhm     exact exactly that ' s why i have to kind of ask you to get  books maybe i go buy the books and kind of read by myself  uhm so it ' s quite uhm textful i think   uhm   uh uh uh uh  uh uh   so i ' m in a way i ' m quite worried but then on the other hand if you don't take it you you don't because after all it is an advantage you know   uhm uhm  uhm uhm yes two-words     yes you get points you know for university for doing for doing that   uh uh  do the english take the take this subject do any   oh no  no foreigners   no no foreigners no  or no english take     no english no foreigners  it ' s only the chinese from my school that take it  yeah  then what what is the points of   i suppose in of in london there ' re teachers that do teach chinese   one-word uh uh  and there one-word are  three words takes the subject but not in your  school   yeah three words yeah  i guess so three words  not in my school because it ' s so far away  and it ' s a bit i suppose it ' s a bit behind the world  so no   uh uh  then how about the gs gcse level   no no no  no no english take the chinese   no not really i took it uh and it ' s a kind of i had no preparation i just went in i mean it was quite even uh you know somebody from the junior school or primary school could you know could have done it  really   yeah  what do you do in the examination what what did the paper ask you about   uhm in gcse uhm they want you i think there are three parts or four parts i can't really remember there was a listening two-words   laughed  listening   yeah reading and oral it was on the tape you see and you have to answer questions and you hear conversation in you know in cantonese  in cantonese or in mandarin   in in cantonese you can choose  uh uh   uhm in cantonese so uhm they ask you maybe they will talk about uhm maybe their leisure and then they ask you probably about uhm what does uhm so and so do both laughed  you know at their free time and you kind of just put the answer it ' s quite i mean quite straightforward  no  and i mean the also in the writing you have to in the writing part you have to uhm compose you know compose uhm an essay   uh  an essay a short essay   a short very short   about how many words   uhm it says two hundred words but i did about  three hundred or four hundred  i just couldn't stop uh for reading you have just to see like   it ' s easy   uh uh  like a comprehension   yes and you see uh chinese words then you have to put the meaning uh in english down below i mean discover really really straightforward   uh uh  and h how about oral the oral examiners  ask you some chinese     three words   no there wasn't an oral because nobody would  you know would have come and and it would be difficult  i suppose   uh uh   uhm uhm    if we did have oral it will be yeah i think it ' ll probably be easiest   yeah  yeah yes it ' s interesting i think     yes it ' s quite interesting  so the syllabus uh of this uh of the chinese subs  subject in advanced level is quite different from the one in the gcse  gcse level /    oh yes  yes  yes   yeah you have to study chinese history do you have any experience   uhm not at all  learning chinese history   not at all yes two words  uh   yes  so it would be quite   yeah quite difficult   yeah  quite difficult   yes but but uhm some of my friends have tried last year    i think one of them got a b and three of them got a c so   uh uh   uh uh   uh uh uh uh i suppose you can get a a   oh i i would like to yeah but i don't know whether i can i doubt it  how many subjects do you take this year   uhm three subjects  three subjects   but i think  which three sub     chemistry physics and math  and i also try as further maths   physics and math  further maths   yes as  as   it ' s kind of like half of a level  uh we have the same  as level yeah it is called    uhm   yes   yes  yeah advanced supplementary you know that kind of  yeah  we have as level uh from in hong kong   oh i see  uhm uhm   yes i think you get half the points uhm it is uhm for the math you just basically do more modules    uhm for for an as maths you have to do three  for uhm for maths you ' ve to do six modules  and for as further maths you do nine and et cetera   uhm uhm uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   i mean it ' s quite  i don't really like maths really i don't know why i ' m doing it  but i suppose uhm it ' s one of the subjects that i ' m  good at that ' s why i think i think i ' d better do it  $a laughed  but you ' re interested in chemistry   yes i am very much so  so you you plan to uh take the subject in the university   yes i i hope so i hope so i i ' m thinking also of engineering and i think i ' m   engineering then you have to very good at uh mathematics if you do engineering    yes  yes and physics maybe  what what kinds of engineering   uhm i ' m thinking of chemical engineering  chemical engineering   yes i like chemistry and people tell me why don't you do chemical engineering   but but we haven't have have this subject in the university of hong kong  we have the mechanical     uhm three words  yes  uhm   you have isn't don't you have kind of like uhm industrial industrial yeah we have the industrial     i suppose that ' s kind of s quite similar in a way   uh uh
