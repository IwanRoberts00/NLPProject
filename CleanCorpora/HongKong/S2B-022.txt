""
as we enter into the final phase of transition  hong kong
people  ' s confidence over the future had greatly increased 
""
certainly it should not be a surprise 
""
if we look at the economic forecasts for nineteen ninety-seven our
economic growth predicted at five percent which will be better than that of
nineteen ninety-six 
""
our stock market is at all time high  and the transactions in the
stock market is more than that double of the same period of last year
""
confidence in property sector remains high 
""
therefore we should look forward to a very good nineteen
ninety-seven
""
yet there are people trying to paint a gloomy picture about hong
kong  ' s future 
""
i think at the end that they will be greatly disappointed 
""
the future chief executive and the provisional legislature had
already been in place 
""
it is my view that the provisional legislature should make lost
which are absolutely necessary on first of july nineteen ninety-seven 
such as nationality  definition of permanent residence sar emblem and flag
""
other than these  the provisional legislature can look into laws
to reflect article twenty-three of the basic law  and consider election
laws for the first legislature
""
the earlier we have the election laws for the first legislature 
the faster  we can conduct elections
""
there  ' re still people in our community trying to influence people
locally and internationally  that the provisional legislature is illegal
""
i would like to make it perfectly clear  that the provisional
legislature is not constituted by hong kong law 
""
it is constituted according to the national people  ' s congress
standing committee  ' s resolution on thirtieth of august nineteen ninety-four
 giving the power to the preparatory committee to handle affairs related
to the establishment of sar government 
""
therefore the provisional legislature is constituted by the chinese
law 
""
there is no question about the legality of the provisional
legislature 
""
of course there is added value  if the national people  ' s
congress can reiterate that the provisional legislature is established under
the chinese law 
""
i would like to talk about some of the concerns of the senior civil
servants 
""
i  ' m in constant contact with our senior civil servants 
""
i certainly understand  that they will wish to continue to serve
the sar government 
""
it is a good indication  that the civil servants are committed
to hong kong 
""
i believe  they will continue to serve hong kong 
""
i have always maintained  that the civil service should be
politically neutral 
""
unfortunately  as we witnessed the events unfold in the past few
years  that no one can deny that the civil service has been politicized
""
the need to push legislations through legislature knowingly that
some of these legislations may not have a future post nineteen ninety-seven
""
""
yet they had to take up the political role  such as
constitutional reform in nineteen ninety-four  sadly had destroyed the
political arrangement of through train
""
to this day they still had to say in public that the provisional
legislature is not necessary 
""
yet after nineteen ninety-seven they have to work with the
provisional legislature
""
therefore i  ' m in support of the civil servants being politically
neutral 
""
the executive council should take up the political responsibilities
in policy formulation and selling the policies to the public
""
the executive council must have the rule of confidentiality and
collective responsibility 
""
when they make decisions they should be held responsible
""
the liberal party is investigating the blueprint of managing hong
kong 
""
it was written based on our experience in public service 
""
we are of course concerned about the lack of attention being put on
economic restructuring  our economic development  and with particular
 emphasis  to industry 
""
we are also making proposals on people  ' s livelihood issues such as
housing education welfare for the elderly  transport  medical services
et cetera 
""
after completion  we will have the opportunity to meet mr tung
chee hwa to present our report
""
the liberal party is confident  over the future of hong kong 
""
we believe  we have a role to play in strengthen our economic
structure  and to improve the social needs of hong kong 
""
we will publish report  after our meeting with mr c h tung 
""
i notice that the chinese economy  grow by nine percent last
year and inflation was at six percent 
""
this is a very good news for hong kong 
""
after several years  the high inflation rate finally came under
control 
""
we should continue to expect a good growth rate of chinese economy
 and hong kong will benefit from the economic growth rate of china 
""
our economic link with china is closer than ever before 
""
for many years the liberal party has suggested to governor patten
 that china is our largest trading partner 
""
we should set up a china hong kong economic cooperation committee
with a term of reference  same as hong kong us economic cooperation
committee and hong kong japan economic cooperation committee 
""
as you know  these suggestions  fell on wayside 
""
china being our largest trading partner and we are the largest
investor in china it is unthinkable  that we do not have such a body to
coordinate the economic activities of the two sides 
""
we are now making the similar suggestion to mr tung chee hwa 
""
mr tung being the chairman of us hong kong economic cooperation
committee  certainly will see the merits of setting up such a committee
""
""
it is important for the future of hong kong  that we understand
the developments in china 
""
when our businessmen and investors seeking assistance then we could
have an avenue to coordinate with china
""
i  ' m hopeful that this committee will be setting up in the near
future 
""
finally a few words about housing 
""
i was greatly disappointed by the recent report that the production
of public sector housing will be short by fifty thousand units before  ni
 two thousand and one and from two thousand and one to two thousand and
four there will be a shortage of another fifty thousand units 
""
i  ' m sure the easy excuse is supply of land 
""
we should be clear that the supply of land of public housing is not
controlled by the land commission of the joint liaison group 
""
the hong kong government is solely responsible for the supply of
land for public sector housing 
""
there  ' re many people came to see me complaining of the long
waiting time for public housing 
""
why we are in this situation 
""
to me the answer is very simple 
""
the government had miscalculated the increase in population  and
mismanaged the housing production 
""
this situation must be remedied 
""
i  ' m glad to hear mr tung chee hwa during his  campaign said 
that housing is the number one problem in hong kong that he will take steps
to alleviate the situation 
""
i  ' m certain that the provisional legislature will monitor the
future plans for housing 
""
i  ' m looking forward to the improvements in this area 
""
i believe with determination  this problem  can be resolved
""
""
""
""
there  ' re only about a year left before the changing of
sovereignty
""
the hot subject at the moment  is who will be the chief
executive of hong kong special administrative region 
""
my own view is  whoever will be the chief executive should
possess the following criteria 
""
firstly the person must be acceptable and respected by china 
""
it is very important that he can work with the beijing authorities
on equal basis 
""
therefore a person respected by china will be easier for him to
perform his duty 
""
the chinese leadership will take his advice as he defends hong kong
interests 
""
secondly  the person must be accepted by the hong kong people
""
""
of course it is very difficult to guage  whether hong kong
people will support him 
""
nevertheless  the four hundred member selection committee surely
 in electing the chief executive  will consider the views of the hong
kong people  and members of the selection committee should be widely
represented
""
i  ' m sure the preparatory committee in establishing the selection
committee  will consider clearly about the representation of each
individual member of the selection committee 
""
therefore i  ' m in support of  nomination by organizations or
groups  even though the nominee will be there in individual capacity 
""
thirdly  the person must be supported by the civil service 
""
the civil servants are the important ingredient of our future
success 
""
the chief executive must be able to work with the civil servants
 and being respected by the civil servants 
""
and finally  i would like to see our chief executive enjoys good
international reputation 
""
because hong kong is an international business and financial centre
there are major investments from the international circle 
""
this is why hong kong is highly successful 
""
if our chief executive  establish himself with good
international reputation and knowing people in the political and business
circle will certainly enhance the confidence  of international investment
""
""
and to a larger extent  they will continue to invest in hong
kong and recognize hong kong as an international business and financial
centre 
""
before end of nineteen ninety-six  the chief executive will be
elected 
""
he will ensure a smooth transfer of power  and lay out policies
for governing hong kong in the future 
""
it will not be too long for the hong kong people to wait 
""
i certainly hope the uncertainty will be over by december nineteen
ninety-six 
""
the second topic i want to talk about is our economy 
""
the government announced the gdp growth for the first quarter was
at a disappointing three percent  yet our chief economist and financial
secretary maintained  the second half of the year would be better 
""
therefore they will not change the overall economic growth rate for
nineteen ninety six of five percent 
""
it does not take a great mathematician to figure out  what kind
of growth rate that would require in the subsequent quarters in order to
reach the five percent overall growth rate for nineteen ninety-six 
""
i  ' m not trying to talk down our economic performance 
""
nevertheless we are experiencing slow down in in the retail and
restaurant sectors 
""
our exports and re-exports may pick up a bit in the second half
 but it will be very difficult to reach the five percent overall growth
rate 
""
i have mentioned on numerous occasions  that the government
should do something about our economy
""
the liberal party has had made ten suggestions  which i do not
intend to repeat each and every one of them here but to our disappointment
the government had done nothing and take no measures to stimulate our economy
""
""
so far it is only lip service
""
we are not  only facing the challenge on the political front
but also face slow down in our economy 
""
i urge the government again  not only to pay attention to the
economic situation but  actively take measures to stimulate our much
needed recovery of the economy 
""
the third subject i would like to talk about is the provisional
legislature 
""
i  ' m fully aware  that there are opposition voices with regard
to the setting up of the provisional legislature yet we all know this is the
result of no through train arrangement 
""
after seventeen rounds of talks in nineteen ninety-four  the
british side decided to withdraw from the negotiations 
""
it is not the time now to blame neither the british nor the
chinese while we are facing this situation
""
the preparatory committee has already passed a resolution  of
establishing the provisional legislature  and it will last no more than
one year 
""
the provisional legislature would be elected by the same selection
committee which will elect the chief executive 
""
therefore i estimate the setting up of the provisional legislature
will be some time not later than early next year 
""
i hope to see all of my colleagues in the legislative council
today will stand for election to the provisional legislature 
""
whether one will be elected or not is  anoth  another
matter 
""
it is not the time to argue whether we need the set up of a
provisional legislature 
""
it is a fact  and it will be there 
""
it is time to participate  or at least to consider to
participate  in the process of its establishment 
""
finally i would like to speak on the subject of north west railway
""
""
i understand the consultancy contracts ready to be awarded by kcrc
amounts to seven hundred and fifty million dollars  and i also understand
this  will not be the end of consultancy contracts 
""
of course i  ' m not an expert in railways  but to build a
forty-kilometer railway  and to pay such a huge amount of consultancy fee
 i would question the wisdom of kcrc and the government 
""
furthermore i understand to build this forty-kilometer railway
will cost over eighty billion hong kong dollars  which included five point
four billion dollars land acquisition cost 
""
this means  the cost for the railway is almost at two billion
dollars per kilometer 
""
i ask  where in the world will have such an expensive railway
how much kcrc will charge the fares in the future in order to recover the
investment 
""
the transport panel of the legislative council certainly will ask
these questions and seek answers 
""
all in all  hong kong is prosperous  but not to the extent
to hand money to people 
""
we should never let it happen unless we understand what it is all
about 
""
we must do everything we can as legislators  to protect the
interests of the hong kong people
