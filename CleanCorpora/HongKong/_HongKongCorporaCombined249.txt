may i please you my lord ladies and gentlemen members of the jury i am making my address to you also slightly out of order a ahead of my learned friend for the first defendant because my client the third defendant is the principle culprit against whom is alleged the count of attempted rape not attempted yes attempted rape and indecent assault have been made by the victim of this case and therefore i feel that it is more appropriate if i were to go ahead first and dealt with those points before the counsel for the first defendant makes her speech to you now you ' ve been told members of the jury that there is this a distinction between the functions of a judge and your functions the function of his lordship would be to direct you on the relevant laws in relation to rape indecent assault attempted rape and the need for corroboration now those are his lordship ' s function it ' s it ' s not for me to tell you what the law is i ' m not really qualified to do that only his lordship his own court rooms is qualified to do that and you must take the law from his lordship as he tells you but on the other hand you will be told that you are the sole judges on the fact you are the body of persons who were ultimately decide what actually happened that evening or that early morning and that you will do by looking at the evidence that has been presented before you by my learned friend for the prosecution and modified or changed by cross-examination my learned friends have suggested their opinions of how you should look at the evidence and of course is our duty to do so but you are perfectly entitled to ignore that if you disagree that his lordship will also pass his own comments on the evidence to you you can ignore his comments if you want i think that would be the only opportunity in your life you can ignore a judge ' s comments for you  at the end of the day when you ask to deliver a verdict you don't even have to give reasons but remember at the beginning when you were selected each one of you either took oath or affirmed to return a true verdict according to the evidence and what does it mean it means that you must not speculate it means that you must cast aside your prejudices it means that you must be you must be you must not be impassionate you have been introduced to these defendants and in particular my my client the third defendant as an accused person your first re impression of the third defendant may not be that impressive i must say it ' s not a very nice set of circumstances in which you met my client he has been sitting behind bars he has been labelled the defendant accusation has been against him but he is innocent until he ' s proved to be guilty and before you retuned the verdict he is an innocent person and this is the beauty of our legal system and that is why we have the so-called burden of proof on the prosecution an accused person is does not have to prove anything he does not have to prove his innocence he is not presumed to be guilty because he is charged because of accusations made against him so i ask you members of the jury cast aside your prejudices cast aside your feelings of social awareness you may think that rape indecent assault attempted rape theses are great social evils i ' m sure you think that way but that is not your function that function will be performed when it comes to his lordship  in sentencing any of these defendants it ' s only then that he will reflect the public condemnation of such behaviour you are not the person to do that you can't say these boys they are so naughty they ' ve they deserve to go to prison that ' s not your function your functions is simply to look at the evidence to analyse it and then to decide whether you think that the evidence is sufficient to prove that they are guilty and you are sure that they are guilty now what does it mean that the burden of proof is on the prosecution my friends have explained it very clearly to you already but i would like to add this when the verdict remains with the prosecution it means the defendants do not have to prove anything and therefore it is not required of them to go into the witness box to give evidence they do not have to go into the witness box to say that i ' m innocent because they are until you think that otherwise because of what the prosecution has seduced before you so i ask you not to draw any adverse influence against them because they have not given evidence they have not deny that they are guilty i ' m sure his lordship will tell you about that in greater detail not only is the burden on the prosecution prove all the offences against these defendants they have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt you it may seem like a legal terminology but in fact it means what it says you must be sure you must have no reasonable doubt in your mind as to their guilt before you can convict if you have any reasonable doubt whatsoever that doubt must be given to the defendant and he must be acquitted now there are many many ways in which the prosecution may have failed to prove an offence beyond a reasonable doubt for example you may think that some of the prosecution witnesses are not really that reliable you may think that a victim that she she may be a liar you may think that her credibilities sus is is suspicious you have seen her give evidence you have watched how she changed her evidence you have watched how she evaded questions under cross-examination she was practically members of the jury refusing to supply details of how all these happened allegations are easy to make in this case the allegations are not supported by other evidence we have an extreme example of a case here members of the jury the police arrived according to the prosecution ' s case almost minutes after there has been an alleged rape it ' s alleged that the rapist did not use a condom it ' s alleged that there was full sexual intercourse he was alleged there was ejaculation inside the woman and minutes later the police arrived what more can you ask for from the prosecution ' s point of view the suspects were not arrested a few days later he was not arrested months later or years later they were arrested minutes after an alleged rape numerous items of clothings swabs samples were taken from the from the victim from suspects immediate action was taken by the police and what have we got here nothing no contact evidence whatsoever no evidence of transfer of fibre between clothings no forensic evidence to support the victim ' s allegation what what can you ask for if in a case of this nature you cannot have any forensic evidence to support the victim ' s bare allegation can you really have any forensic evidence and any other cases to support any allegation of rape we may as well do away of all these forensic tests in other cases of rape  absolutely nothing i tell you and excuses have been made excuses have been made for not turn out with these fruitful results matters of judgement by the doctor uh she doesn't think that it was necessary to do this test sixty one items were delivered to her this simply not good enough according to the prosecution these boys were virtually caught red-handed now what are we left with nothing except the words of a prostitute who didn't really care how old these boys were she was raped to render sexual services to them at a price she thought she was raped because she was never paid is she a credible witness can you really put the liberties of these boys at risk because of the words of this woman  you will be told members of the jury by his lordship that in all cases involving sexual allegation including rape attempted rape and indecent assault you should look for corroborating evidence and if you do not find corroborating evidence you can still convict provide that you believe the victim there is none there is no corroborating evidence against the third defendant in respect of any of these three charges which are left with which he face he faces my my learned friend for the prosecution has said corroboration is evidence which tends to support the victim ' s evidence now that ' s wrong that is not the right legal definition for corroborating evidence he is only partially right not all evidence which tends to support a victim ' s allegation or evidence is is corroborating evidence because if it is then you can say oh the knife under the bed is corroborating evidence uh you may say oh the finding of the of the uhm stolen property in the possession of the accused persons that is corroborating evidence because they support the victim ' s evidence that is absolutely wrong in order to be corroborating evidence in order to be evidence which can support the victim ' s evidence in such cases involving sexual allegations such corroborating evidence must be able to implicate particular defendants in respect of the particular offence for example if the third defendant had admitted to the police officers after he was arrested that he did attempt to rape the victim that is corroborating evidence  the towels on the bed is not so you must be careful now his lordship will direct you on on the law relating to corroborating evidence and i ' m sure that he will usually in very clear terms and it ' s very important for you to listen to his direction very carefully because otherwise you get mixed up and you may think that any any evidence which is consistent with the victim ' s evidences called corroborating evidence and that ' s not so and in this particular trial there is no corroborating evidence not even in respect of the not only in res in respect of the rape but also in respect of the attempted rape and the indecent assault there is no other evidence except the victim ' s bare words that she had been indecently assaulted by by the by the third defendant  miss sze had already drawn your attention to quite a number of discrepancies between the oral evidence of madam ng given in the court and what she told the police in various witness statements she gave in the beginning of nineteen ninety three i would refresh your memory on what i believe to be the some of the more significant discrepancies and i will not be able of course to deal with all discrepancies as we ' ve got there is quite a number of them firstly sh she reminded you that there is a discrepancy relating to the number of days left between the time madam ng left hotel conrad and the last time she stayed at the accused ' s flat at cheung shan estate another discrepancy she point out to you relate to madam ng ' s explanation as to why she left the accused ' s flat the day before the twentieth of november nineteen ninety two whether it was as a result of boredom as appeared in her cautioned statement or whether it was because she was scared as she had said of the third discrepancy your attention had been drawn to is whether  hau referred to a thursday or friday when madam ng told you that she was scolded by him for leaving him too soon another discrepancy your attention can be drawn to is whether the accused went back together with madam ng and hau and the other person  after they left the restaurant to the accused ' s home and you have also been reminded of the discrepancy as to whether the flat was in fact the accused ' s flat or as madam ng said in her statement to the police after identifying the accused that it was the accused ' s girlfriend ' s flat madam ng gave you her explanations in relation to those alleged discrepancies she also explained that she did not give the police as full account of the details or had given the police some inaccurate information because of the following reasons and i ' ll remind you of them she first said that at that time when she was giving her statement to the police she was too frightened to talk too much the reason of course mr hau was still at large had not yet arrested by the police then she suggested that mr hau had in fact threatened her by the phone over the phone she said that she felt a lot better in court now that mr hau had been arrested and she felt more secured and that ' s the reason why she i is able to tell us more detail and she also said that she did not really checked the witness statement carefully before she signed because she was tired she she told you that she had been for twenty four hour she also told you that she was able to remember more in court because crown counsel had led her through what happened day by day during that period carefully and step by step
