i i really don't have any plans at the moment because i ' m having
my term test at the beginning of the term
so i have to be studying because i ' ve got only two weeks more and
last few days i haven't been doing anything but just uh going out with my
friends
so from next week i ' m hoping to make a time table sit down and do
some work

yeah because i haven't been there before
and hopefully we ' ll be able to go there
i ' m not too sure about it yet 
uhm uhm
how how many people
 
uh about five or six i think
haven't still decided
because most of my friends are going back to their own countries
uh because most of my friends are overseas students and all of them are going
back to their countries during the holiday
so the people who are left here will go to macau with us 
well before christmas eve or after
 
actually they want to be in macau on the day after christmas eve
like on twenty fourth evening
so i ' m not too sure because some people have been telling us that
uhm there ' ll be a big crowd there during christmas because everyone is on
holiday and so and so forth
so i ' m not too sure we have to see
haven't still decided yet 
 uhm 
 uhm 
macau is very uh is a very interesting place you know
you can buy a lot of things
so remember to buy me something laughter 
 
okay but is it cheap there because i don't have lots of money 
well i i will introduce uh to you some private tuition 
laughter 
 
uhm okay but uh private tuition i ' m not too sure whether i can
you know whether we are able to teach
i i don't know
as university students may be we can but because i ' m an overseas
student and uhm because of that i ' m not too sure whether we can really work
in hong kong 
 uhm uhm 
well you know actually there ' s some families who ' re very like who ' re
very like uhm overseas students you know to talk to them

yah yah 
 
 uhm 
 really 
you know at at the time you teach them mathematics biology or
something like that you ' ll uhm you ' ll teach them also some english
 
uhm uhm

yah but still i haven't decided because actually i wanted to uh to
some private tuition after i got my results before but my brothers and my

and she like she likes food very much prinji laughter 
i think you you would like to meet her some day 
 
 oh 
well i ' m i don't like food very much but i like to
 cook i 
 what 
 you don't like food
 
no i like to cook but that doesn't mean i like food because i
don't know why but the past few days i haven't been able to really eat
because i don't have an appetite
and i i went for a buffet with a friend of mine and
sorry 
when
 
uh just last uhm last saturday 
 last year 
ah ha 
 
 no last sunday 
last sunday
 
 and 
 where 
where
 
sorry
in central 
aw
 
and i just couldn't eat you know like he he he served himself
twice and he ate most of the things but i just couldn't eat
i just ate very little and only when i came back i thought uh i
wish i ate some more 
$a-laughs 
 when is 
 
it ' s evening
uh no it ' s for it serves for lunch 
uh uh
chinese ch or western cuisines
 
no sri lankan cuisine 
really
sri lanka
 
yeah 
central
where where where is it in central
 
there ' s a place called club sri lanka which we went to
and actually one thing i didn't like the food there at that time
because it was vegetarian and i wanted some chicken or some kind of meat
so and i wasn't i didn't have a big appetite to eat so i was like
thinking ah i should have eaten some more because my friend he really really
like the food you know
 and 
 your friend
 
yes alice my friend
 my 
 do 
i know him
 
uh do you
i don't know 
what
what are you talking about both-laugh 
 
uh i ' m not too sure whether you know my friend
he ' s just a friend
he is just a good friend that is
the best of friends
and nothing more than that
okay alice
are you satisfied 
yeah very satisfactory
 
anyway he ate a lot
he was able to like really eat and after he could hardly walk
you know because he was supposed to go shopping
he was supposed to go shopping
yet about five minutes he said ah he can't hardly walk because he
ate so much 
uhm uhm
how much was it for one person
 
uh seventy 
seventy
 
uhm uhm 
uh uhm
that ' s very reasonable
yeah i may go some time
 
yeah actually the food is not is not very hot
it ' s not very spicy because most are the chinese and foreigners
go there
because back in sri lanka we eat a lot of spicy food but here
because of the other foreigners who come there and they don't make it very
spicy
so the day when i went the my friend eats spic spicy
food so they put more chillies for us 
do you think the cook are from are from sri sri
lanka
 
i think so because i was able to speak to one person in
singhalese
i spoke i spoke to that person in singhalese after lunch because
i haven't spoken to anyone in hong kong in singhalese except for some of my
family friends
so it was nice speaking to someone in my own language 
i i would like to learn singhalese some time
i think it ' s very interesting you know to learn uhm another
language
 yeah yeah i i think i have got talent laughter
 in this area 
well wh what about how how can you say uhm breakfast in
 s singhalese
 
 yah 
 wow 
uhm hold on just let me recall my singhalese 
 what 
what
pardon
 
 okay i must be telling you now uh my singhalese is i can't
say is very good because i haven't spoken in singhalese for some time
and even when i go home i speak to my parents mostly in english
 
so i think breakfast in singhalese means uh
 two-singhalese-words i think
 one-singhalese-word means uh in the morning
 one-singhalese-word means food 
so food in the morning is 
two-singhalese-words i think 
 uhm 
 two-singhalese-words a overlaps with z ' s unclear
speech 
uhm yeah thank you uh very good thank you laughter 
how come you s you talk t with your parents in
 eng in english but not in singhalese
that ' s very strange to me
you know it ' s your mother tongue
english is not your mother tongue
 
yeah in a sense i speak english plus singhalese so it ' s it ' s uh
it ' s a mixture of english plus singhalese
so if i say something about breakfast i might say something in
singhalese and say breakfast in english
so that ' s why as soon as you ask what does breakfast
 mean in singhalese i couldn't really quickly tell the word because
i wasn't too sure about it you know so 
i find it very interesting
you know in hong kong we often talk with people in a mixture of
english and cantonese
i think that ' s the same
is this the same case in sri lanka
is it a very uhm general situation or some or very special one
like you
 do you think you ' re special
 
 ah 
i ' m not too sure whether i ' m special but it ' s just that uh i
come from kuala lumpur
and that ' s the capital of sri lanka
and i guess most other people there who are educated and who have
been going to like leading schools in sri lanka speak a lot of english but
when they go to the rural areas most of them don't know english
they speak singhalese
so there are a lot of people who speak english in kuala lumpur
and the areas close to kuala lumpur 
so you mean people living in the big cities and uhm in on
urban area speak a lot of english rather than their mother tongue or a
mixture of them
 
uh it ' s a mixture of them
 yeah 
like you speak english as well as singhalese yeah 
 ah huh 
some people in hong kong uhm don't agree with this kind of
situation because they think uhm the english is degrade undermines the
cantonese because when yo you speak in both languages and one uhm
can't you can't speak very fluent cantonese you know
because you have to sometimes you ' ll use to uh to use some kind
of english words and then you you just forget your mother tongue laughter
so wh what do you think about that
 
uh actually i ' m not in the same situation 
$a-laughs because sometimes i forget my mother tongue 
$a-laughs just like now you know
so i speak a mixture of english plus singhalese 
even if i go back home even if i am speaking to someone who
doesn't know english sometimes i might put english first because i won't
realise that and you just i ' m got i got so used to english
just comes out a few words naturally 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
uhm what what what ' s the teaching medium in s uh sri
lanka
is it english or singhalese
 
it ' s it ' s singhalese
we do our o-levels as well as our a-levels in singhalese
it ' s the first language and we just do a paper in english as a
second language
but uh there are schools like international schools where you can
do either a-levels or latin o-levels 
do you study english since kindergarten
 
uh yes i study english since kindergarten uh as a second language
but i did my o- levels and my a-levels in singhalese 
 s s what o-levels and a-levels
you you have o-levels and a-levels in
 
 yeah 
 uh 
 
so uh did you go did you go home during the weekend 
oh i just come from home yesterday laughter 
 
really 
yah yah that ' s right because my mom miss misses me very much
and they needs me
 
oh 
$a-laughs 
yah well i shouldn't talk about that because we ' re just
having a quar we just have a quarrel last night 
 
 really 
 why 
because they don't want me to go to us
 
really
why
why is that 
because they want me to stay in hong kong and have uhm you
know to to think about my future
yeah because you know i have to graduate uh from university uhm in
nineteen ninety five
and until now i haven't finger out what i want to do anyway 
laughter 
 
oh yeah 
yeah because i you know tut i ' m studying uh english
and japanese but it ' s not a kind it ' s not professional
so i have to decide which field i like to tut you know to
join
uh uh i have to think about my career and future
uhm that it ' s really confusing laughter 
i hate it laughter 
 
i know
i a-few-words when i when i was after my
o-levels when i was doing my before i did a-levels i wasn't sure what i
wanted to do
i wanted to do dentistry but though my father was a dentist i
wasn't like they didn't push me saying go to dentistry
you know so i was thinking like am i choosing the correct field
you know i like dentistry but yet i wasn't sure so in that period
was very confusing because i wasn't sure what to do what is future going to
be
so you need to think a lot about it 
yeah i know
sometimes you have to think about what society what kind what kind
of people society needs
and i think family gives you a lot of influence
i think that ' s very that ' s very tut important
well anyway i don't know what ' s important laughter 
but i uh there is some i have uhm tut a pri a
priority right now
the first thing i would like to do is administration
something tut about administration in a companies or
organisation like that
and second thing is i ' ll i ' ll may be i would like to be a uhm
 tut inspector in police station
 
really
wow
yah then z overlaps with a ' s unclear speech we can get
some help from you alice 
do you need my help prinji
 
yeah i need your help
you never know 
all right i ' m i will always stand by you 
and give you my help if i can 
 
 wow 
 thank you 
thank you very much 
you ' re welcome laughter 
you know the payments very nice
 
really 
uhm in chi in hong kong royal police
 
wow that ' s great
so you ' ll be rich as well
so you ' re my friend alice 
$a-laughs 
and after your graduation you ' ll be dentist
and you ' ll you ' ll be rich
and you ' re my friend prinji laughter 
that ' s why i like you so much
 
uh bad influence both-laugh 
yeah we are the same kind of people aren't we
 
yeah but money is not everything you know
so you should never think about earning money you know
you should just do what you feel like doing what you want to do
uh whatever you earn is two-words 
you should never think about just money
it ' s not worth it 
$a-laughs 
yeah i i totally agree with you because money isn't
everything right
and in my life friendship is the most important thing prinji
 
 yeah 
 you ' re the people i really treasure
yeah i like you very much both laugh 
so what what ' s the most important thing in your life
 
well first comes my family and then comes my friends
because uh when i came to hong kong when i really realise the
value of friendship because i don't have anyone here except for some uh
family friends but like they are very busy with their own work so i don't
always like ask them for help
but during my difficult times my friends had been with me the
friends whom i ' ve got to know for one year like my overseas as well as my
local friends
so my i i really value friendship because friendship been
something very important to me
and i ' m a sort of a sensitive person so if something happens
between me and another friend it uhm bothers me a lot you know because i
always want to get friendship straight
i just want you know i don't want any quarrels or any
misunderstandings between friends
so you know what recently i had a big mis 
misunderstanding with a friend of mine
and it hurt me a lot
it hurt me very much and i it took me some time to get over the
whole thing and you now start new again
so i value friendship a lot and more than that i value my family
and you know two-words 
uhm uhm
yes indeed i agree with you because i think man can't stand alone
in this world
sometimes not sometimes i think all the times we need support and
love from our friends and people we love
 some uh i think sometimes we have to give and receive
love at the same time
but that ' s that ' s not very easy to do because i don't know
sometimes i think uhm tut i ' m still learning this kind of thing
yeah i i don't know when when shall i graduate from laughter
 from the school of you know uh in di different school of
society
well yeah that ' s true
friendship is very much it ' s very very important
 
uhm uhm but uh just as you said now that you have to give love
and have to receive love but i don't know it ' s like as i told you earlier i
got hurt form a misunderstanding sometimes some time back
and i was like telling my other friends you know i i try to help
my friends
i try to do something for them
and sometimes it doesn't go uh to the way i plan you know like
you give love to them but you don't receive it
you know so because of that i ' m not so keen on receiving love at
the moment
i just want to give what i have to them
and at that time i was just thinking you know am i giving too
much for them you know
i ' m doing so much for them but yet they don't see that you know
and they think it ' s like it ' s not very significant or something
 like that
yeah something they take it for granted you know
and i don't like that cos so i don't know
friendship is uh something very complicated you know so i don't
think i ever graduate from it because its really complicated
you can't like you have to everyday you learn something new from
friendship i think
learn about people and how they react to everything because each
person is different each person is an individual
so we have to always think from their point of view as well you
know
so uh i don't know 
 granted 
well i think i think friendship is something very uh delicate
you need time and you know your heart to cultivate it very in a
very careful way
uhm sometimes you ' ll you ' ll break it suddenly after laughter
 you you have cultivated for so lo for a long time
i think that ' s do you think it is there is a guarantee in
friendship
 
uh i don't know what do you mean by guarantee in friendship 
well i mean uhm its something that can you really trust your
friends forever
 
actually that ' s what i want to do because i want to like there ' s
a saying which says that to trust a person is much greater than to love that
person because before loving a person you should be able to trust that person
you know
so uhm i don't know like sometimes i feel that i trust people too
much and i think each person it ' s like me
each person is trust worthy
each person will do best for the other per other person
you know
but i guess it ' s not same as everyone
some people they just do for themselves what they want to do
so it depends on you know the person whom you ' re referring to
some people might be trust worthy some people might not be so i ' m
not too sure 
where are we just now laughter 
pringi help me
 
about friendship 
oh yes friendship 
let ' s talk about another thing laughter 
 
 yeah 
yeah 
uhm well do you think ho uh people in hong kong are
very money-oriented
 
yes i think so
uh i don't know hong kong is a very very busy place you know
it ' s it ' s like always rush rush everywhere
people running here and there like you know it ' s just too busy
for me
i i don't think i would like to after i graduate i think i would
like to go back to my own country because this place is too busy too crowded
and you know everywhere you go you see people everywhere
and just even on the mtr you know sometimes like i want my own
space you know around me and its so crowded in the mtr and i just don't i
just don't like that you know
and i think people are quite money-oriented in hong kong
they just work for just that you know 
yeah i wonder were what k what kind of life uhm 
tut you will lead in sri lanka
is it very harmonious very comfortable
what kind of life do you live in do you lead in sri lanka
 
uh very quiet life i think but at the moment there are a lot of
problems in sri lanka as for political problems
so actually me and my family we don't get involved in politics so
we don't really care about what ' s happening in politics you know so whatever
happens we just lead our own life and we just do our own thing
so i think i don't know like even when i went uh back home for
the summer it was so like it was a big difference because like whole of last
year like everyday school from eight thirty to five in the evening come back
eat and then go to the library studies
it was all this rush rush
and when i went back home i was able to really rest and have a
very quiet time
you know so i think it should you should visit sri lanka some
time and we can see it for yourself you know 
yeah i i would love to
 wh when will you go back to sri lanka
 
uh i think i might go back during the summer next year because
during uh dur 
 
this is you haven't mentioned this before
a fund 
uhm i i don't i don't know exactly the name of the fund but
it ' s a fund which uhm is created by one-word part of
the labourer ' s salary
and then uhm in the past uhm they cannot take back their fund
unless they are old or they are retired
but uhm many many labours are coming from other
provinces so they are afraid that they can't take back their funds
so when the regulation change they quit their job because they
want to get back their funds
 
 uh 
so it ' s a kind of provident fund 
uhm i think so
 
yes you have to look at find out about the term is in chinese and
then look it up and find the exact wording
 it ' s probably like a provident fund or retirement
fund
provident fund sounds more like the right term 
 yes 
uhm uhm
 
 but it 
 will it create a big problem because at that
time many labourers quit their jobs so the businessmen need to explain to
them that they can get back their fund in the future but they are not quite
sure because the regulations are changing rapidly
 
when was it 
i think it ' s a few months ago
 
oh good
okay
it ' s quite recent
yes i make a side about it
uhm
who you are going to find out about it from
 i suppose the officials people in business 
 uhm 
 i think i will interview my relative and some
companies which have a large number of labourers from other provinces
 
 will you 
will you be able to talk to some other workers 
uhm i i don't know
 
see if you can do that
uh i should imagine you can speak some uh putonghua 
some laughter 
 
i suspect that they ' re in the same situation but if you can get
direct to those people you might find some quite interesting comments
uh that ' s nice
uh and the pre-terms 
pre-terms
 
is it uh important pre-terms 
i don't know if it is called pre-terms from 
 
 i haven't heard anything called the pre-term
so it ' s typed so vat something like that 
it ' s something it ' s something like sales tax but 
 uhm you you need to pay the tax before you really sell the goods in
 s china
 
 uhm 
and you don't get the money back 
uh you can get the money back but we don't know when you can
get them back
 
do you mean you get all the money back or just part 
uh you can get part of the money back
 
yeah 
but uh you you don't know when you can get back all the money
because the amount that is given in each year is is quite constant
the office the officials will only give a num a number of
money or a an amount each year
so if uh if the number if the amount need to be refund is is
greater than that number so you need to wait for the next year
so and then you wait and wait wait
 
so otherwise they ask you to overpay 
uhm
 
say say that are not quite sure as they ask you to pay
say a million dollars and then the bill actually comes to eight
hundred thousands uh they ' re supposed to refund you the
two hundred thousand but in fact they don't do it 
or they take a long time to do it 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm so may be you you can get fifteen
thousand this year fifteen hundred this year and then next
year you can get some back but 
 
 uh 
 they call it one-word
 and drafts 
yeah but you don't know when you can get back all the money
 
all right
that sounds good
yes
 uhm 
 so so many companies uh tut don't
don't sell the goods in china because of this regulation
 
oh i see
and in a way that really comes under this part here
uh this part is is a good side about it because it ' s a specific
event that affect it the industry
and it ' s probably haven't been written about
so i think it ' s quite a good one
this one here is sort of a general problems that may fit better
under there unless you can find some change some reason for separating it out
your travel plan is fine but when are you suppose to have these
thing in 
i think may be on the sixth 
$z-laughs or seventh of april
 
 or was it uh april not may uh 
no april
 
well it can't be april because you want to go in easter holiday
which is in april 
yes 
is it eight or ninth april
 
may
i thought it was on twenty eighth of april but i ' ve forgotten
about that 
because the fourth of april is easter ho is ching
ming festival
 and from fifth to 
 
 yes 
 now what i ' m saying is when do you have to give
it in 
aw aw
 
it ' s twenty eighth of april 
 twenty twenty-sixth
 
will you will you be leaving yourself enough time 
uhm i think the most par the most of the most of the
contents i ' ll interview the people doing business in china 
 through phone calls or when they come back 
from china 
and i think i ' ll i will only do some interview about the
government officials or some labourers in the easter holiday
 
 uhm 
 yes 
 good 
well i think you can certainly prepare yourself by talking to
people on the phone even if you can't do the story from it
and gathering statistics and talking to as many people here who
are involved in investing in china and business in china
uhm so that you got a pretty good idea of what ' s going on before
you actually go there
and can know where your story is going even if you don't want to
write it to that point
so that you know what to look for in china and uh uh can write it
quickly when you come back
can you get chinese government publications here too 
i think i can get some and i can ask my
relatives to bring me some
 
 yeah i ' m looking to that 
yes
yup
right
that ' s what i call a shoebox job
you ' re going to have a big box to put all of your information in
because you can have to get together a lot
good
okay
you got any worries 
uhm not as worry as before
 laughter 
well that a bit more positive
what about the money to go to china 
uhm i think it ' s i think it ' s not a problem because i i
don't think it will be expensive
 
okay
have you worked out where you can stay 
uhm no
 
all right
okay
well nearer the time we will looking to the money
situation
and see what money is available what we can get for you to defray
your expenses
uhm cos i think it ' s a good to go there
uhm anyway anyway even if you ' re not doing business but uh it ' s
a good to go there and actually get information from the ground
you might find in the end that you can actually do most of your
story on what you get in china and that what you collect in hong kong is only
background but we shall see
we shall see
i ' ll be interested to hear what you get
and have other people in the third year been to china to do
reporting 
uhm they ' ve been to china for travelling laughter 
 
right z overlaps with a ' s unclear speech 
do you know anybody who has been to china to do any reporting
i don't know
 
your trip to china two-words the official
you know that that you can find uh for another business people that you can
find and ask if they might have interviewed the workers
you might even find workers works outside on the street i don't
know but how they would take to being stopped to interviewed
don't get yourself arrested but laughter 
you know thieves hang around the station i don't know if this
still a problem with finding work but people used to hang around the station
waiting for jobs because that was a sort of centre
it ' s possible you might be able to talk to people there
hard jobs
right it looks as if it ' s getting f on fine
your next uh job is to collect statistics to collect background
and start talking to people
is this my copy 
uhm uhm
 
yeah
okay i ' ll keep hold of this
uh get over this to tdc
get to the various organisations where but business people go who
are interested in investing in china
the american chamber of commerce will probably help you actually
 and the british chamber of commerce bound to have uh some
people there who are hong kong people
what do you want to talk to other foreigners too 
other foreigners
foreigners too laughter 
these days you ' re not quite sure what hong kong people are
are they really chinese or are they foreigners
uhm but you you might find that there ' s a uh some some foreign
business people who are willing to talk to you as well
might get some information from
okay so that ' s sort of gathering your basic information upon
which to start
and have you got a computer at home 
 uhm 
 uhm 
yes
