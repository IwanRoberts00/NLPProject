""
well a very good evening and welcome to the macau jockey club  ' s
taipo racecourse of course tuesday night  ' s sand racing  ten events on the
surface at the moment runners behind the barriers for the second event 
the ligurian handicap  class six gallopers over a thousand and fifty
metres
""
race one of course has already been completed
""
we will bring you a replay in around fifteen minutes  and for
this second event the early favourite number six yes boss by stephen chow
""
and louis corrales 
""
i tell you what as i speak  i  ' m predicting he  ' s he  ' s a late
scratching
""
he is in fact  so about to come through on your screens number
six yes boss a late scratching  now  as we came to air i can tell you
he certainly was in the field and the favourite for the race  but
obviously something amiss there and  yes boss a late withdrawal out of
this second event 
""
so the night starting really with a bang  the favourite out of
race number two
""
ah just quickly our commentators  '  selections franko lau  did go
 number six to win but that leaves now ten king warrior on top  to
defeat four new hero and five golden apple
""
harry troy four seven  and five
""
new hero to defeat no money no honey
""
and golden apple now gets a gurnsey in third myself don't like the
race  so i thought uh number seven no money no honey uh  i certainly
put him on top before the scratching of yes boss cos he was terrific value
and  i thought the favourite was under the odds 
""
uh i think new hero uh is a chance but wouldn't have him as
favourite 
""
king warrior is only uh horse i  ' d be rating a tierce chance in the
race  not the winner
""
and he  ' s second favourite at nine to two  so i just thought no
money no honey was the way to go and hard to see why golden apple uh is a
double figure quote 
""
he  ' s won his past two previous grade
""
on those occasions he did jump from barrier one and tonight a
different kettle of fish from barrier twelve but  uh i tell you what 
he  ' s won two-in-a-row and this isn't a very strong race
""
he uh actually uh  the way he  ' s uh burned the sand uh his past
couple of starts  barrier twelve he should at least be able to get in 
get in  somewhere near the lead  so he  ' s a silly price
""
i just like seven from five uh first two favourites are pretty much
layable for me although new hero uh showed a lot of speed last start but he
will have to do a lot of work from barrier nine 
""
quickly the changes tonight just repeating  the favourite in
race two number six yes boss is a late withdrawal and a riding change in race
two  jubilation is now to be ridden by chris maund 
""
number three is chris maund
""
now we get the blue light for the second event
""
race three another riding change chiu wah best also chris maund 
uh takes the ride there 
""
race four number eight god speed 
""
the new rider is hiden cheung  h k cheung aboard number eight
""
race five and six are clear of changes
""
race seven a withdrawal  one leung shan min is out  replaced
by the standby be a good horse barrier nine 
""
charlie c f chan take  ' s that ride
""
race eight  summer fly is out  no changes there  or sorry
no replacements there  so race eight number four summer fly withdrawal 
race nine is clear and in the ten  number four sparky has been withdrawn
 again no replacements  race ten number four sparky
""
shouldn't be too far away from the start in race two 
""
just repeating franko lau has gone ten four and five  harry troy
four seven five  and i thought no money no honey uh was the horse to beat
from golden apple uh but he has now come down to seven to two no money no
honey  and he needs to jump out of the gates but he  ' s got a good rider
aboard in danny beasley so if he can get him out and running he  ' s obviously
a chance seven from five
""
uh not a race i  ' d like to have a third selection in  sydney
 because uh yeah i  ' d rate new hero a chance  but it should be a far
bigger price than what he is the same case for king warrior
""
i  ' ve actually selected him to run some big races at big odds
recently but  uh only uh at at forty-nine dollars fifty you could only
really rate him a tierce chance in the race not the winner 
""
so  again you  ' re taking certainly uh short odds about a few of
these 
""
so shouldn't be too far away from the red light for race two
""
just repeating in around ten minutes we  ' ll bring you a replay of
the first race tonight 
""
i  ' m the captain steve mooney 
""
we  ' ll be joined a little later on tonight by franko lau  but
first of all  it  ' s a very good evening to our race caller for tonight as
we get the red light  harry troy 
""
""
thanks steve and a very good evening everyone 
""
very pleasant night for racing here at the taipo track
""
now they are starting to load for the second of the evening
""
favourite number four new hero jumps from gate nine 
""
early favourite was number six yes boss 
""
he was a late scratching  scratched at the barrier
""
so a field of eleven to do battle  
""
and good support late for no money no honey  number five golden
apple was around fifteen twenty to one

nineteen goes  and he runs on well for third
""
not too far away was win win  and in the black cap golden apple
just weakening away a touch 
""

put the writing on the wall last start i felt when he had a very
tough run  at one stage seven and eight deep  and still managed to
close  up  and finish the race off okay
""
tonight a bit more luck 
""
he  ' s ridden just off the speed
""
he  ' s been a bit too good for them

he  ' s a horse that can miss the start quite badly but was
positioned just behind the speed and they went a little quick also

gone to the line to win very easily

""
as they now  as we now have a look at the head-on replay 
new hero uh took the pace uh but he was uh found wanting over the extra fifty
metres tonight
""
also there was king warrior  but no money no honey in that
purple cap  he  ' s kept driven forward by danny beasley and  really
there was nothing coming out of the pack really to attack him
""
uh major moves maybe a bit unlucky there in the pink cap 
""
he didn't get through until the final stages
""
and  win win uh gets through late to grab fourth position
""
uh not really to much else to speak of out of the race i  ' d have
to say 
""
""
and let  ' s have a look at the getaway 
""
off and running  and getting in the air a touch at the start
was jubilation
""
he got back with grand duke
""
win win was slow away  and likewise golden apple
""
now no money no honey the eventual winner  that  ' s him in
midfield in the white cap  rather the purple cap  the light colours 
and he just gradually works across 
""
by the time they get to the first corner he  ' s two and three deep
 and then even manages to get a little closer to the rail after that
""
but as they settle into stride we  ' ve got forex supreme being
shaded by  on the outside  golden apple and new hero
""
no money no honey now just  with the drop on them  traveling
nicely for beasley in third spot
