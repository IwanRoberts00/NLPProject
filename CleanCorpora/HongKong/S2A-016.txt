<I>
well a very good evening welcome to the macau jockey club ' s
taipo racecourse course wednesday night racing this evening and we have
ten races on the sand surface the going tonight is normal watering 
runners ah behind the barriers now for race number two the moruya handicap
class six gallopers over sixteen hundred metres the early favourite number
four original ahead of one universe who ' s met with a lot of support in
this second event 
we will of course bring you a replay of race one that will come your
way in around fifteen to twenty minutes and we only have one change for
tonight ' s programme that comes in race five number one natural fortune has
been withdrawn and he ' s replaced by the first standby happy stride he ' ll
jump from barrier four and martin chan takes that ride c k chan aboard
happy stride number one in race five 
so runners behind the barriers the one and four is also favourite in
the q at eight to one and obviously we ' ve got a bit of time up our
sleeves i ' ll quickly go through the runners for this second event as we get
the blue light one universe
so often close up he ' s actually yet to fill a place in five runs on
the sand but most of those performances had actually been pretty good
including last start while he finished fourth he was most unlucky not to
figure in the top three victory together ' s not racing well for me 
martini star won well over the trip two starts back a little
disappointing last time original the favourite always catches the eye
gets a mile back flashes home 
so the runs always look good but he is still a maiden on the sand
 and uh i would only like him for the second or third position due to his
run stall just gets too far out of his ground while the run obviously
was good last time
he ' s likely to do the same again tonight 
siu yik will stay but mixes his form however has the services of
danny beasley 
dragon warrior goes forward number six i think
it ' s a big plus in the race and ah i can envisage him getting a
reasonable run up near the speed
so i think he ' s a chance of running a race here at odds 
explorer ran a little better last time but i i think he still needs
a little more time and under the odds at the moment at only nine to one 
asian glory won over fifteen hundred last time a fair run last
time but not out of the question to see him maybe grab a third position 
leun yat supreme recently trialled better but still his two
runs this season have been poor and i don't think twelve to one is much spoil
 and grand nam hoi a nine year old mare but ah she continues to finish
close up and she is an obvious chance for the minor end 
in this second event our commentator ' s selections franko lau
likes the way of four original to defeat three martini star and five siu yik
 four three and five for franko lau harry troy likes one five seven
and nine universe to defeat siu yik explorer and leun yat supreme and
i did like the chances of universe
as i said he has been ah close up quite a few times on the on the
sand so there ' s a zero from five record i think he will be able to
improve that this evening and didn't have much luck last time finished
fourth should have been much much closer 
so i thought he could win from five siu yik ah i thought he was
open to improvement fresh up will stay danny beasley aboard and six dragon
warrior uh
i think he will get a good run up near the lead to help his chances
out 
i ' ve gone one five six i really do only like original fill uh
fill a minor frame here because again he will get a mile back the run
pattern on the sand always against him and he just does catch the eye each
and every start and uh he ' s just likely to do that again tonight get
back storm and look like a good run 
i ' m the captain steve mooney we ' ll be joined later on by franko
lau but first of all it ' s a very good evening to our race caller harry troy
thanks steve and a very good evening everyone they ' re just
about set dragon warrior about to go forward flashing the favourite
number four original and just about set they ' re off and running 
absolutely flying the gates was dragon warrior he lands in front from asian
glory leun yat supreme away well tonight and going forward to be prominent in
that leading division as they run to the winning post for the first time is
universe 
crowded a bit deep grand nam hoi
now there ' s a line of four on the back of him favourite original
 over on the inside there in the white cap to his alongside of him i
should say explorer followed then by siu yik martini star victory together
the tail ender into the back they run dragon warrior the pilot a
length and a half in advance of asian glory universe gets to third
travels okay tacking on to the back of him but a bit deep then
is the mare grand nam hoi followed then by the favourite original
he ' s midfield the rail
he ' s just been shaded by martini star in the centre splitting
them was uh then explorer followed then by siu yik second last was
victory together and leun yat supreme is the tail ender and ten off the lead
 seven hundred metres out dragon warrior rolls along a half a length in
advance of asian glory
he travels well universe travelling in third appears to be
travelling okay favourite saves ground the rails
original not not too far away then explorer martini star going
forward around the outside to get into the race 
on the back of them was siu yik he ' s under a bit of pressure but
he is making ground grand nam hoi dropping off victory together and leun
yat supreme the tail ender on towards the corner and hard headed dragon
warrior about to be taken on by asian glory 
coming at them on the outside universe starting to wind up with
explorer and running on just fairly siu yik 
asian glory raced up and put the head in front of dragon warrior
they ' re out by three to explorer running on over on the inside victory
together and universe 
but asian glory got clear one hundred out asian glory a length
and a half from dragon warrior running on late then explorer and down the
outside universe but asian glory too good 
asian glory four on the wire to explorer dragon warrior runs third
close up then was universe followed then by victory together 
now let me see weakening away very quick then was dragon warrior
followed by grand nam hoi siu yik favourite never really going original 
and he ' s ran back towards the tail of the field with martini star
and leun yat supreme raced on the speed 
and a little bit too good for them got the upper hand here
inside the final one hundred metres and ah young james chio back in the
saddle after a recent injury 
and it makes it two out of three for asian glory ass he gets nicely
clear of dragon warrior he weakened away very quickly dragon warrior 
explorer gets into second and let ' s have a look how they fair
for third but a big space winner was asian glory explorer dragon
warrior just holding third from victory together and universe 
so it ' s eight seven six after the running of race number two eight
seven and six and the winner number eight asian glory james chio for
johnny chan seven year old brown new zealand bred gelding and he ' s by
honour grade from eulogy rose a sangtang mare
and uh he makes it two out of his last three 
did have the best record of any runner at the distance was
disappointing last start but he was a winner two starts back and he seems to
go okay for this young boy james chio number seven is second explorer
robbie burke for stephen chow and he ' s a five year old chestnut
new zealand bred gelding stark south hi there and officially third is
going to be number six dragon warrior
he held on for third t k nip and tai lam out of karma cruise
from kiakaha and the number one universe ricky choi for stephen leung winding
up in fourth eight seven six and one it ' s four and a quarter by three
quarters he got away and won quite convincingly 
favourite or or original he was disappointing and also
very well supported late was universe and he again was disappointing 
the run time of one forty-four point six and big dividends on
offer here
it ' s a hundred and eighteen dollars the win for number eight asian
glory thirty eight fifty the place 
number seven explorer twenty five dollars and number six dragon
warrior twenty four dollars

eighteen dollars
we ' re off to a break 
back shortly commercial break 
well welcome back live to taipo racecourse asian glory wins
race number two for johnny chan and james chio that ' s his fifth winner this
season so he ' s done a good job as he hasn't had too many rides and
asian glory
the dividends now confirmed one hundred and eighteen dollars the
win thirty eight fifty the place 
seven explorer returning twenty five dollars
number six dragon warrior held on for third at twenty-four dollars
the quinella five hundred and fifty seven the tierce eleven
thousand three hundred and eighteen four and a quarter by three quarters
the margins one forty four point six the run time as the 
it ' s a very slow run time also even for class six so uh the track
might even be riding slow but still um nothing to inspire out of that race
he ' s won it quite easily though asian glory
he ' s uh kept uh up to the mark by james chio uh really nothing
chasing at all
you can see universe in the red cap 
he uh has ran fourth but he has just battled and uh the favourite
original
he uh he usually gets a long way back and i think they ' ve just
tried to run him a little more forward tonight but by doing that he really
hasn't found under pressure 
yes he was under a fair bit of pressure a good way from home
never that far off them tonight but hasn't finished the race off that
flash now dragon warrior anticipated the start
he absolutely flew the gate and he lands a couple in front of asian
warrior asian glory i should say who was very prominent straight away
tonight 
now getting into third universe a bit deep as they run to the first
corner grand nam hoi and leun yat supreme are the four behind them
the favourite original right on the back of this leading brigade
 explorer in the yellow a little bit deep siu yik and alongside of him his
stablemate which was martini star who was about to take off and circle the
field as they run into the back 
and tacking on to the back was victory together into the back
and the speed not that quick
dragon warrior with a length and a half lead over asian glory 
in third spot universe travelled well but again didn't finish the
race off today
