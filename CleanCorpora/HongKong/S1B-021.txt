good evening and welcome to newsline
i ' m sally blyth and with me as usual is political commentator t l
tsim
this week newsline looks at the implication of china ' s move to
sack one of the few liberals as to appointed to become a hong kong affairs
advisor
no less than twelve chinese newspapers this week condemn beijing ' s
decision to withdraw its invitation to meeting point chairman anthony cheung
many commentators believe that it was meeting point ' s merger with
martin lee ' s political party united democrats which was the real motive
behind the decision to cancel mr cheung ' s appointment
udhk are considered hostile and subversive by beijing
if china feel they cannot tolerate hearing the views from
dissenting voices now what are the implications of this after nineteen ninety
seven
joining us on the programme is anthony cheung
we also have the leader of the other pro-democracy party in hong
kong frederick fung from association of democracy and people ' s livelihood
good evening to you both 
good evening
 
uhm perhaps if i could start first of all with you mr
 cheung and what are the reasons which china gave you for suddenly
withdrawing your appointment as an advisor 
 uhm 
 uhm 
well they gave only one official reason which was that uh they
initially appointed me in my own personal capacity
but subsequently they knew that uh should the new party i mean the
future democratic party decide uh not to support my role as a hong kong
affairs advisor then i would withdraw
but i told the chinese officials very clearly that even uh in
january when they uh invite me to become an advisor
i ' ve told them that uh i would only accept the invitation with the
agreement of my own party which is meeting point
because i ' m chairman of meeting point there ' s no question that i
can accept the invitation uh purely in my own personal capacity
and they knew about that
so i said well if the same principle which will apply in a new
democratic party
but uh they said well for meeting point they know us they
understand what we ' re doing but for a new party they ' ve no knowledge no
idea
so i guess my uh the cancellation of my appointment definitely has
something to do with the fact that i ' m uh participating in launching the
new party
 
isn't china ' s argument fair though that it is a new party they
know nothing about the new party 
and you almost deliberately misled china by accepting the
appointment without ever letting on that you ' re in negotiation with udhk
at that time about merging your party with udhk 
i don't think that there ' s any question of
misleading anyone
because uh early in this year when china invited me to become an
advisor we ' ve not yet started uh discussing with udhk about the possible
uh launching of the new party
uh so uh i mean that that took uh a bit of time
but in any case i don't think as a matter of principle uh we should
have to get china ' s blessing for whatever thing we are doing in
hong kong
mr fung you are still a member of the hong kong advisors
group and 
 i think so because i ' ve not yet accepted 
 the the invitation uh uh paper uh somewhat like that
 yes 
you you have not been 
 because you got the ceremony will hold hold 
will be hold on twenty fifth uh this month
yes yes and you have not received any communication
 uh which says your services are no longer required
 so we assuming you ' re still a member of the hong
kong advisors group 
now your party of course also wanted a merger with the other
democratic parties 
uh fortunately for your party uh this application uh was turned
down 
now uhm do you still want to seek an alliance with the united
democrat and meeting point after what ' s happen to mr cheung
 not not yet 
 no not 
 okay yes 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uh i think we did mention uh to mr cheung and martin lee that uh
we did have uh held a general meeting uh emergency meet general meeting uh
about ten days ago
uh we raise uh three points see whether the new party accept
our three points or not
if they uh they accepted i i think we have no doubt that we would
like to join it
and you are prepared to take the risk that china may now
cancel your appointment
actually uh uh when we discuss about whether we should join it
or not 
we prepare we prepare anything that may happen at that time 
not now
so the the application still stands but you have those three
conditions
 <
yes
 
don't you think your credibility thoughs a hong kong
advisor is now on the line
 since china obviously not wanting to hear any
views which it doesn't want to hear in order words mr cheung has now not be
included as one of the hong kong advisors 
 uhm 
uh i think i i i also told uh china clearly when they in uh 
invite me to to be advisor whether me whether i accept it or nor
i did told them that i 
even though they insist that their their invitation is indi
 by individual 
uh my acceptance will have the agreement with the adpl
if they do not agree i will i will i won't i won't accept that
and so uhm as to me i think uh i will discuss with them
anything that the adpl uh agr adpl agree me to talk or discuss with
them
 
now you ' re going to be prepared to be as outspoken as you might
 wanted to be in the light of what has happen this week 
uh i don't think we we need to change our attitude
mr cheung uh have you considered the possibility
at all of uhm detaching meeting point from the united democrat again so
as to enable you to serve
 uhm 
no i don't think that is uh uh any any question we will consider
because uh when when we discuss with udhk about the possible
launching of a new party of the two groups
uh we have not taken uh the hong kong affairs affairs advisor 
issue into consideration
we don't think that is a uh part of our consideration
uh we took a very careful and uh we think a very uh
important step forward by agreeing uh to launching new party on the basis of
meeting point and udhk
i think that is uh in the best interest of the democratic camp
in hong kong
and also by doing so we are are preparing to uh uh be very
committed to hong kong in the long run
i think this is uh uh we ' re on the right path and i don't think uh
we should change our timetable or our direction simply because china has done
uh uh there ' s about my appointment as advisor
if for the hell of it uhm meeting point and united
 democrats finally decide to include adlp into their camp then you you
would have the pressure of seeing mr fung either be excluded or china
having to bite the bullet and and take him as he is
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
well i think i must make one thing uh clear here
uh and no time have either meeting point or udhk said that
we are excluding adpl from this new democratic party
indeed we are welcoming anyone uh apart from meeting point
members and udhk members from join uh joining the new democratic party as
founding members
uh the only thing being that uh as far as the launching
organization is concerned
there ' re two meeting point and udhk the two uh parties in our
general meetings have decided that we should keep the launching part uh
launching organizations uh to only meeting point and udhk
but as far as membership is concerned it ' s entirely open
 
but that ' s they can only join on an individual basis not
as you say as an umbrella group as the adpl 
 well it uhm 
the new party has not uh uh uh fed a federated party
i mean even meeting point members and udhk members they join a new
party in their individual capacity as founding members
i mean that that that is the same treatment to be extended to uh
non-meeting point and non-udhk members
 
why don't you want mr fung ' s group as uh part of
the foundering members 
 uhm 
well i mean uh this is a new party which is open to anyone who is
committed to the manifesto of a new party
uh so obviously we want to see people apart from meeting point and
udhk members to be founding members
uh we have not uh we have decided not to include adpl as one of
the launching organizations
i think that is based on the decision of our general meetings
i mean uh uh it cannot be denied that among the membership i mean
there are views uh which are are not too positive about you adpl
but anyway i think that is a separate issue
would these views or objections have something to
do with adpl ' s attitude towards the basic law
uhm some of the leaders of adpl uh itself and some of the the
uh stance they have taken
 uhm 
well there were various views express within uh uh the
membership
i think these views were particularly uh stronger i would say uh
among adp uh udhk members
but we have managed to sec secure the membership ' s
support that adpl members i mean they they they can join the uh new party
as founding members
and as founding members they have the same rights and obligations
of course as other members founding members including members from 
meeting point and udhk
 
mr fung do you accept this 
i think there is difference you know uhm the first point
is that uh
if we join it individually it should it i i think there may be i
don't know whether is there any machinery that is it you we
have a hundred and twenty uh members 
is it a hundred and twenty member will be accepted 
 
or you will screen them 
uh sec third secondly is af after you
are uh the the forming process it means that we are we are what we could
do is we accept whole of of the the decision you you 
you decided in in october
or if you you have some different ideas or some points then we
we can't we can't change it or you you can't raise our uh
objection or other ideas
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
yes
 
mr fung you ' ve been accused actually of being a political
opportunist for blowing with the wind
and now you can see that the threat of a new large big
pro-democracy party is actually going to threaten your own
organization your election chances in the future
is this the only reason now why you want to join a new party 
 uhm uhm 
i i i don't accept the the comment because uh as our our
association ' s direction towards china we did say that we want to uh have
 try to communicate with them
on those things we do not accepted we will struggle with them 
uh of course somebody or the uh as uh hong kong will be some some
people thinking that uh you either stand against china or you support it 
but we are it seem that our our strategies may not be uh 
accepted by the the the people or by the by the mass media
but it it is true isn't it that china regards your party as
the the the less subversive the least subversive of the three let us say 
 
uhm that is not necessarily good for you in a 
general election yeah 
so you will have to come to terms with that or try to change tack
along the way
 yeah uhm 
 yeah agreed 
i think uh as uh our our direction or strategy if you think that
uh china is the central government of of the sar in the coming future i
don't think we should cut all the channels
but you you are in a very difficult position 
 i know
you have a united democrats meeting point
alliance on the one hand then you have the dab on the other
and there is uhm very little room for you to manoeuvre
you you have to you know join the the largest party in
hong kong which is going to be democratic party and run election on that
basis or be squeezed out
 uhm uhm 
uh i think the whether we join it or not join it e e is
not the the uh the crucial crucial moment for us you know
because uh as what our uh usual daily works uh you know our
candidates of the district broad of the uh urban council they did work with
the uh residents in their constituencies for years
i think they know them well 
 one-word for the uh legislative uh election
concern i think no matter we join the uh new party or not i don't think other
than k k fung there will be more than one candidate will be elected
 
well we just 
 so that join or not join is quite the same
 
well we ' ll continue this discussion in just a few
minutes if we could just take a break there
do join us again we ' ll be back 
 okay 
uhm a break 
 
welcome back to newsline
in the programme this week we ' re discussing the future of the
pro-democracy political parties in hong kong and their relationship with
beijing
we ' re joined by anthony cheung from the newly created democratic
party and fredrick fung whose own party has been excluded from the new
political group
mr cheung has been dumped as an advisor to china because of its
involvement with the new party leaving mr fung as the only pro-democracy
activist in beijing advisory ranks
uhm and we ' re just discussing at the end of that uh 
first part uh your bid to try and join this new democratic party which
is being rejected 
uhm why is it that you want to join a party when on a lot
of issues you ' ve actually in the past disagree with both udhk and meeting
point stance 
 yeah 
 yes 
uh i don't think so
even though some point some points we are disagree with each each
other but it ' s
most of them most of them are not uh disagreement in principle
but two-words some some sometimes always the
strategies or tactics
but uh you know i think we are quite closely with the meeting
point on the direction toward china
uh so when i i see that there there ' s a merge merger
between uh meeting point and udhk i think uh if meeting point haven't
changed their direction
it means that the udhk may change their direction towards
china
and i would like to see that direction you know
so you think that there shouldn't any conflict then
but but one-word 
 
 mr cheung is that something you agree with 
well i think it ' s uhm too simplistic to say that uhm
i mean meeting point ' s direction towards china different from
udhk ' s direction because i i don't think udhk would agree with that
but of course i mean our style may may differ in in handling the
relationship
but can i come back to the point about uh accepting adpl members
as founding members of a new democratic party
indeed we are extending invitation to uh members outside
meeting point and udhk to become funding members
we have done the same to adpl and we have done the same uh to
uh the hong kong democratic foundation
and indeed for the foundation they have not found uh uh pro
 problem by not be uh being one of the launching organizations
they are quite happy to encourage the members to join the new
party
uh there ' s going to be a procedure whereby uh people can apply to
become uh foundering members of the new party and so long as they are
committed to the uh beliefs and manifesto of a new party
i think that should be this the sole criteria
but of course we have noticed from newspapers that a couple of
adpl members they have uh i think a bit of hesitation about the new
party
i mean they have suggested that uh the uh approach i mean meeting
point ' s stance on the political reform in hong kong and also udhk ' s stance
on political reform
they found it a bit difficult to accept and they suggested
that uh uh uh we are sort of puppets of the american and the british
