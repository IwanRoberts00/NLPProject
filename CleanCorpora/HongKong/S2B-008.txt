the airport consultative committee will meet on monday to
discuss whether it should be consulted before each round of sino-british
airport negotiations 
member leung kwong cheung noted today the negotiating teams are
expected to seek the views of the committee according to the memorandum of
understanding on the airport project 
he said the teams had shown a lack of respect for the committee by
not consulting it on the agenda of the forthcoming airport talks in beijing
british foreign secretary douglas hurd has given his
undertaking that china won't be allowed to interfere in the running of hong
kong before nineteen ninety-seven 
but he said britain still intends to discuss with the chinese on
whether there should be more directly elected legco seats in nineteen
ninety-five 
the foreign secretary was answering some pointed questions on the
territory in the house of commons
we have these highlights house-of-commons-speeches 
as he mentioned in his reply the foreign secretary will be
dropping by the territory at the end of this month
his visit has been scheduled for july twenty-sixth to the
twenty-eighth
reactions from local legislators on the foreign secretary ' s
comments were varied but most welcome the fact that he had clarified his
position on the two sticky issues of appointments to exco and the speeding up
of democracy
may wong reports
well i think the british government must be quite fed up with
all the threats and warnings being uh deliver by the chinese government in
the last few weeks
and in order for the british to be able to govern effectively is it
very important that they assert their authority
and uh and that ' s why i am glad to see the foreign secretary mr
douglas hurd making this statement saying that they are in control uh they
are making all the big decisions may wong continued 
i would hope that mr hurd would discuss this with the chinese
 as soon as possible because the longer he leaves it uh it allows
more uhm space for political manoeuvring for speculation for
expectation to be built up may wong continued 
the government has decided to grant a pay tv licence and
the service is expected to be available as early as october next year
by that time star tv will also be allowed to partially broadcast in
cantonese 
for other broadcasters now in operation the government will be
introducing new rules 
peri chow has details
the government want to award one pay tv licence by january
next year and whoever gets it will be expected to run the service by
october at the latest 
the operator will be given an exclusive right to run the service
for three years during which time it cannot run advertisement
as to subscription fees the government won't set a limit in the
licence but the future operator will have to pay its royalties based on
subscription income 
neither will the government compel the operator to lay a cable
network but doing so can give it an edge over other competitors for the
licence 
the operator must also deposit fifteen million dollars with the
government 
that amount will be forfeited if the operator fails to provide the
services 
as to star tv from october next year it will be able to broadcast
in cantonese on three of its five channels on news sport and music 
at the same time it will automatically be allowed to charge
subscriptions but during the three years exclusivity of pay tv it cannot
charge for its cantonese programmes 
the government has dismissed criticism that star tv has been
favoured for running a subscription service without going through a
competition
and i don't think we are just offering it to star tv uh on a
silver platter 
i should emphasize that we are not allowing one-word
 operators to collect subscription 
only a hong kong base and uplink from hong kong service is
given that right
both tvb and atv will cease royalties cut from twelve to ten
percent
both stations will also be allowed to run advertisement on property
and financial services 
and they can cut their english services and run some programmes in
other languages 
peri chow tvb news
well the new broadcasting policy doesn't seem to have pleased
anyone in the industry
both established tv stations are dissatisfied with the new
framework and wharf which has been after the cable tv licence for years has
expressed hesitation
tvb welcomes the decision to introduce more television
services to the public but it ' s disappointed at the failure of the new
regulatory framework to create a level playing field from all operators in
the industry
 
not all the operators in the tv industry are subject to the same
set of rules
for example rules governing the uh terrestrial broadcasters and
those governing the satellite tv and pay tv operators are entirely different
so the the terrestrial broadcasters have to pay a very high
royalty 
atv wants the government to further relax its stringent
regulations governing free tv services
the company is unhappy with the small cut in royalty
 
atv is not making a profit
any available resources we would like to see them being channelled
to programme development so that uh shall we say we can live up to the
expectation of viewers
uhm however this is uh not to be the case
therefore i i am afraid our share holders will continue to dig in
their pockets to give part of that to the government in a form of royalties
wharf cable finds many fundamental questions unanswered
 
it is unclear to us whether government ' s intent is to award one
licence or two licenses 
the company will conduct a feasibility study before deciding
whether or not to bid for a cable tv licence 
star tv is reserving its comment until further studies

the china motor bus company has agreed to accept from the
government a new franchise that will reduce its routes to just ninety
the two-year franchise will become effective next september 
it will eliminate the company ' s existing profit control scheme 
in line with the government ' s goal to upgrade local bus services
cnb will also be required to meet other conditions 
the government believes there should not be any significant impact
on cnb staff who might be affected by the new franchise
that ' s because there are some five hundred vacancies in the bus
industry outside cnb and the new operator of the twenty-six routes being
taken away from cnb will also require four hundred drivers
