<I>
shall we start now
 
yes yes
what can i do for you 
just talk 
a natural conversation
 
 yeah okay 
alright 
i have seen the doctor before at lunch time with my
mother
 
uh uh 
yeah and uh this morning i go to the hospital the with
my mother and she is going to have a checking called mri
have you heard this before 
 
 uh uh 
 what is mri 
mri is something stand for magnetic something
 imaging im 
something like image and but it ' s very expensive
 
 uhm uhm 
oh 
very expensive
 
yeah yeah yeah
what is wrong with her 
uhm six years ago uhm she has an operation
 
right
she had an operation 
 at saint teresa 
yeah and at saint teresa hospital in hong kong 
and then uhm but recently her backbone is very painful 
 and she has admitted to the hospital last week
 
 right 
 oh 
alright
uhm 
so
 
has she got a slipped disc
what is the diagnosis 
what is 
 
 did they know what ' s wrong with her back 
difficult to check at the uh public hospital because uh the
facilities is not so good enough to check the details so
 uhm 
 
 oh right 
 oh 
a few years ago my husband had some back problem too you know
uhm uhm
 
and the he wanted an operation
the pain was so intense you know that he requested the doctor
if they can do something even if it is an operation you know 
uhm uhm
 
and uh the doctor said operation is not the answer for him you
know at that time because it wasn't that serious and uh
anyway they couldn't find the matching blood you
know 
his blood is uh is uh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
is s s special
 
yeah call it royal blood laughed 
he has the uhm 
 oh royal blood 
a plus 
 
 b positive with antibodies in his blood 
 you know which is quite rare 
and they tried to find matching blood two pints of blood for
him before this could operate on him 
but they could not find so 
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
 so what is the result
 
so he was in hospital for two days
they found one pint but uh the doctor did no
want to operate with just one pint of spare blood you know in case of
emergencies not enough so 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
but uhm my mother uh has this checking you know
the fee is very expensive 
five thousand and six hundreds 
six dol uh six hundred dollars if we if she needs an
injection four thousand dollars plus 
it ' s very expensive
 
 yeah of course 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 yeah 
medical fees are expensive 
 but no injection injection this morning
 
no 
no injection so uhm four thousands four
thousand dollars can be saved
 
 uhm 
yeah so anyway he didn't have his operation
thank god for that because the doctor said if you
 faithfully do your exercises you know you can strengthen your back
muscles to take over the job of your you know back bone 
and he did
and he is marvelous today 
he is 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
have you heard of one officer called uh major rowe
 
no
 i saw 
 dennis rowe
major dennis rowe in australia 
before she uh before he goes back to australia and he works in
hong kong
 
 no i do not know him
no 
oh he went back already 
yep because of the uh back pain
aw
it ' s difficult to get a recovery in hong kong 
 and he needs to come come go back go back 
 
 back pain 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm
many people have this problem 
but you know uh sh he is not an old man
 
no 
no
i think he ' s twenty over twenty to forty
 
 i think 
even young people if you do not have the right posture you do
not sit properly you know you slouch like that 
 for a long time you you get back problem backache
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
but uhm i thank god god because this morning is very difficult
to to pass to me
it ' s difficult to get the time pass
 
oh 
i have wai 
 
 difficult to pass uh time 
i have waited for two hours at the hospital 
 
 you waited two hours 
you know the uh 
is it 
 
 public hospital you do have to queue up for a long
 time 
 it ' s the private
it ' s private two-words so they 
 
private 
oh which one 
the saint teresa
 
saint teresa oh 
 yeah so it ' s very expensive
and i think in hong kong
 
whereabouts is saint teresa hospital 
saint teresa hospital
 
where is that 
uhm uh prince edward road
 
prince edward
oh it ' s here in kowloon 
yep 
prince edward yeah
or you can go from the waterloo road two words
uhm do you know the baptist church at kowloon city
 
 oh 
yes 
just down the road 
yeah but uh i think i thank god because we have one good
family doctor and she he is very caring 
 about my mother and myself 
and
 
 uh uh 
 yes 
 uhm 
 right right 
 right 
you you keep healthy 
i think it ' s okay but my stomach has some trouble 
again
 
gastric or what 
i don't know
i have seen a specialist at uh at my school 
because i ' m i am transferred from my school clinic to the uh specialist
clinic at western district 
four doctors said i just have uh the pain the stomach pain 
but i recently i have seen one doctor and he said
uh i get another problem but he don't know 
he doesn't know the problem so he want me wants me
to get another uh treatment and checking
i don't know the result yet but i
 
 uhm uhm 
 uh 
 uhm 
 oh 
 multiple words 
you need to have a proper check up before they can treat you
but you know it ' s uh it ' s difficult to say but i don't
trust the government the public hospital 
 
 why 
i don't know but you know uh one doctor will say
something and the other doctor will say another one-word 
so what you can one-word 
 
 you can always go for another second opinion or
another doctor 
so i will go to the family doctor to s
 to get another advice
 
 uhm 
 yeah 
you go to a family doctor and your family doctor advises this you
can always uh ask the doctor to uh recommend you to see a specialist or
you know if he is not able
sometimes family doctors are just gp and they they they you have
a special problem then they refer you to a specialist 
and i think i ' m in growing because i i don't i i ' m
not crying
 
no good you are more mature now 
 no ex 
yeah because if uhm my mother or my grandpa has some problems
then i will cry
but recently i haven't
 
uh sometimes you know your emotions uh you just cannot control
uhm uhm
 
it ' s uh as you grow older you learn to control 
 but i tell you my secret
 
uhm 
my secret is last night i have s seen a movie
 
you saw a movie 
yeah
 
what kind of movie 
uh something like walking with me someone walking with me
uhm the s story is talking about a blind girl
 
blind girl 
yeah she can't she can't see 
she can't see anything
 
 two-words 
blind 
blind
she is blind and the servant one servant of her family
is looking after her for a long time and s 
 it ' s very touching
 
 yeah 
a sad story 
not a sad a sad story
uh the story is talking about a person a blind person
yeah and how to achieve her goals 
and now i don't know she is dying or not but uhm the movie
is touching
and the most important thing is i have seen the grace of god
towards this person because it ' s it is a true story but i s i have
seen the miracle the power and the strength of god towards
 this person
 
 how to overcome the problem 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm and it ' s beneficial for you to you know that you
have seen this movie 
 and i i will uh think about my mother and my
grandmother 
they are not christians
 
 uhm uhm 
no and you are trying to witness to
 i hope 
yeah
i have taught my grand grandmother to play
 
to pray 
yeah
 
that ' s good 
because of uhm her pain 
you know the old the elderly will have pain usually so i i
have taught her to play but
 
say to pray 
to play
 
no
pray 
p r a y
 
yeah 
play
 
pray laughed 
 okay 
 
to play means you know
to play three cantonese words 
to pray 
 games laughed 
uhm uhm
and when i s have seen this movie i cried i have
i have cried because
 
 uhm uhm two-words 
very touching 
uhm it ' s touching and the other thing is uhm i have felt
and experienced the grace of god especially for my
family situation in all 
 
 uh uh 
 you went by yourself or you went with someone 
with my friends
 
you went with your friend 
yeah
 
uhm 
and and sometimes i think my grand my parents are
divorced divorced
 
they are divorced and who are you staying with 
i stayed with my mother
 
you are with your mother
do you see your father 
no
 
do you want to see him 
 i don't want to see him because if i see him
 he will ask for money
it ' s true
 
but do you love him 
honestly i
 
you don't know uh 
you have mixed feeling 
 i don't want 
i ' m not
i do not hate him but
 
 no 
but you maybe you haven't learned to love him yet or maybe
you love him but you cannot express you know 
you have lived a long time with your mother is that
true 
so you don't have very much contact with your father
inside you you have a little bit of link
you want to love him but you don't know how 
because he has no relationship right 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
and i think uhm the next step i want to have is
 sufficiency 
and i feel my mother ' s love towards me
 so i cried just for thanksgiving
 
 uhm uhm 
 right 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
you praise the lord for what you have what your
mother provides for you 
 yes 
and the my wish is to share the gospel with her
 
that ' s good uhm uhm 
so
 
is she responding 
i don't know
i haven't done this uh step yet but sometimes i will
 
it ' s not easy to uh witness to your own people 
i know
 
sometimes it takes a long long time 
what is your suggestion
 
patience and prayer 
yeah and prayer i have 
 
 you know 
in in what is god ' s time though we mustn't give up
we try our best you know 
and sometimes it takes many many years
perhaps not worried if you don't see this up quickly you know
but just be patient because god in his own time will work
something out
and in god ' s economy nothing is wasted 
 
it ' s very useful you know
you might think that it ' s not working
nobody and your parent your mother and your grandmama might not
be responding at the time this time now but you never know
you have sown some seeds and some day that seed will start to
grow
you never know 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 yes 
and i also worry about my future 
it ' s my final year you know laughed 
 
 oh 
 one-word about this
you can do your best 
i do my best and i am three-words
 
 
 yes and then you can't look back anymore
god do the rest 
yeah i know but you know it it ' s difficult to to get an
ideal job in hong kong
 
what is the ideal job you know in your books in your 
not in terms of money i think 
in my in my mind 
 
 no
something that it can make you happy 
yeah
 
you enjoy 
yeah
 
that ' s the ideal job 
yeah
uh but you know it ' s difficult
i want to i want to become an executive
 
uhm uhm
that is very good
aim high 
uh
 
aim high 
yeah but you know it ' s difficult
 
 one-word just like my son
he is aiming very high 
uhm but you know uhm i have uhm an examination for
the recruitment for some of some government posts positions like
executive officer trade officer something like that
i have taken these examinations before
it ' s okay but it ' s very boring 
from nine o'clock to five o'clock the whole day
 
 oh 
exam 
yeah examinations
common recruitment examinations
 
i see 
boring
 
and do they tell you your results whether you pass or not 
no not yet 
not yet
because i think next year april the 
resul the result will be released
 
 they will 
 uh uh 
they will tell you 
and if i i pass the examination 
 
 when is your exam 
for the university
 
uhm uhm 
may
 
may this may 
and when will you know your result whether you pass or
not 
 uhm uhm 
 two years 
the result uhm will be released at at the first day of 
july something like that
 
uh uh
by the start of next summer you will know 
i know
but uhm the the result of the government recruitment is
different from university 
it ' s uh earlier
 
 is different of course 
you want to work with the government 
i don't know but i think it ' s a chance 
it ' s it ' s a chance to 
 
 uh uh 
 to serve the country 
uh you can say that 
but it ' s not easy to get a position in the government ' s
department because the competition is very keen
 
is it 
yes 
i think is s five or six thousand people had 
ap applied these posts so the competition is very keen
 
right
do you have to go for a special training 
i don't know
different different departments will have different arrangements
 
so what is the criteria 
ah the criteria
uhm it ' s de it depends on what posts that you want
to apply
for example the
 
second one you are applying to
what is the criteria 
 i have applied to four posts
 four 1 posts
executive officer assistant trade officer 
administration officer and labour officer
the criteria is a degree-holder
 
 four posts 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm uhm
experience 
uh
 
because sometimes if you want a an executive job you have to
work your way up 
 you need some experience 
 uhm uhm 
uh i don't know because we uhm many of 
many of us
 
 you don't know 
you don't go straight well you know from straight from the
university to be an executive 
uhm uhm
 
you have to work your way up in the government 
office like that you know 
so
 
so maybe the the first few years it might be a little difficult
 but you learn multiple words 
 uhm uhm 
and i want to st to further my study
 
yeah that ' s good 
but not
i ' m i ' m thinking about that i didn't want i
want i do not 
 
 three words 
 think you want to go straight into 
study 
yeah go to study straight away instead of stopping and
what 
 master 
 i have i have thought about that this uh
planning but
 
 uhm 
you want a break 
not a break but does it the subject that you want to
study english or chinese even you choose english or chinese what course that
you want to specialize 
it ' s difficult to to choose and difficult
to choose a good supervisor to work with uhm to work with 
 
and the other thing is if you do not plan to do the doctor
degree it ' s a waste for doing a master degree
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
i don't think so
you can do a master first and then slowly go for a doctorate 
but a great investment a great investment for me you
know 
 
 it won't be wasted you know
it won't be wasted 
i know but i want to specialize in special field 
 
for example translation it ' s my interest 
 or management so i may i i think i may
take some special course
 
 uhm uhm 
 yeah 
 yeah 
 uhm uhm 
aw in translation 
translation or management 
yeah
 
we need a translator 
huh
 
we need a translator here 
i know
dora will
 
will leave us very soon 
i know twenty-first
 
yeah 
but i think i am not qualified because i just uhm study
chinese and english and translation is another branch of
 the uh the department 
and the skills is very important so i need to
learn if i want to be a translator 
but i enjoy to work here especially for the summer job
 
 uhm uhm 
 right 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
yeah 
anyway we are looking for another person to
replace dora
she is very good 
 uhm uhm 
yeah
 
she ' s been with us four years 
four years or three
three years
 
 three years 
three years 
i have heard this before
 
yeah 
yeah
 
she ' s quite good 
how long have you stayed in hong kong
 
i have been here more than four years and i 
uhm 
 oh another term 
another term 
 
this is my second term 
uhm three years for one term
 
this time will be three 
the first term was four 
 uhm 
uhm 
oh
 
they do away with the four-year term now
the new uh ruling now is a three-year term 
uhm uhm
 
so previously many years ago the officers used to do a
five-year term 
five years for the uhm foreigner
 
 uhm 
foreign uh officers 
uhm uhm
 
but then they felt that it was too long and so they cut it
down to four and now four they they find also too long they they bring it
down to three 
your son
 
my son
come here william
uhm we we will be uh two minutes yeah

 wouldn't it 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 oh it ' s the obedience 
 
yes i will go when they ask me to go 
what uh what countries that you have visited before or
worked before hong kong
 
 i this is my first uh trip overseas 
 two words 
yes i have not one-word anywhere out of my
own uh uh territory 
i actually served in singapore out of my country and
 one-word malaysian people 
i was born educated in malaysia and i worked
many years in malaysia until nineteen eighty
i went to singapore and i worked there for ten years until
nineteen ninety 
 first 
 uhm 
and then you came to hong kong 
 
 nineteen ninety august i came to hong kong
i work east in east and west malaysia for many years 
do you like hong kong
 
yes it ' s different 
different from singapore
 
of course
 very very unique 
 uhm 
unique
yeah
 
different languages too you know
i have a little problem because i don't speak much cantonese 
but you can speak very well now
 
well i ' m learning 
you are learning
 
well i ' m learning from you and from all my friends 
here learning 
 uh uh
oh 
but you have such a motivation to push you to work hard
 
uh i thank the lord for friends that or and colleagues you
know that work so close with me
you have no choice but to learn 
right 
can't help it because every day you are thrown into the situation
if you don't learn then you are lost two-words
 laugh 
you have to learn to swim and i pick up the language 
 uhm 
uhm can you speak mandarin
 
very little 
i have learned this
 
is it 
yeah 
it ' s uh twelve lessons 
tonight is the eighth eighth one
 
 oh 
from where
where do you learn it 
uh mongkok
 
mongkok
is it a school an evening school two words 
an evening school
uhm it ' s very good
the teacher is very good
he is very kind 
no homework but uhm he will get some some things for you 
to practise your language
 
 yeah 
but you have uh you have the chinese language
you can learn the you can read chinese characters 
it ' s much easier for you to learn than for me 
 yeah 
but i we need to uhm to read the phonetic writing
 
yes
 two words is it
is it uh 
something like uh
this i don't know how to say but the letters uhm 
three words 
 
 four words 
something like that so i have to learn this
 
i learn a little bit of mandarin when i was in singapore 
it ' s an elementary course and if i can uh
manage this course i ' m going to learn to join the the second class 
 
i don't know how to say
it ' s immediate
 
 one-word 
 uhm uhm 
intermediate 
intermediate yeah
intermediate course
 
elementary intermediate advance 
 and then advance
uhm two words it lasts for three months 
but it ' s good
 
is it conversational 
what
 
conversational chinese or written one 
written uh spoken
 
yeah 
because it ' s just for you know uh in in the group 
 just four of them are students 
other person other people are workers 
 
 yeah 
 the chine the written chinese that they
they use in uh china is different 
yeah 
i know
but uh there is no practice with written mandarin
 
they use two words 
uhm uhm
 s so uhm it ' s relaxing and interesting because i
think i think uhm the most important
the most aim the important aim for this course is to help the
 pe the working people to know more to learn more how to
speak not for
i think it ' s not for the students 
sometimes we are strangers in at at at the class 
especially we are the students of the university 
some people may ask why do you come here and choose to learn
mandarin 
you are the univers uh you are the student of university
you don't need to do that
 
why 
i don't know but they will say something like that
