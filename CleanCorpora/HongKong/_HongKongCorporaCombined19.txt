how long have you been in hong kong   uh i ' ve been here for one hour and half  one year  sorry one year and   one one year   one year and half and before that you ' re in you ' re in japan   yes i uh was  so uh you come here to study mandarin   yes  so are you are you intending to be a teacher or or doing business   uhm actually uhm i uhm so it ' s a long story   and  laugh  you know my father uhm yeah she has a friend in hong kong  uhm he is he is chinese and uh when i quit job   uhm uhm  you quit job    yeah  i i quit the job at that time my father suppose to me to uh going hong kong and uh to speak mandarin because uh fit he ' s my father so uh father ' s friend take care of me yeah   uhm  so you are living with your father ' s friend   uh no uhm i live alone but uhm my place is very close to her house his house yeah  so uhm what do you think about your school life right now   uhm yeah i think it ' s great uhm my course my my course is very intensive and uh uhm i have uh three teacher they are very good and uh  but uhm i think speaking mandarin opportunity is of mandarin is  very few in hong kong so i want to speak more more and more but almost people speak cantonese so yeah  yes i think uhm because this is  maybe a cantonese society  i for my i myself i have learnt mandarin uhm just uhm the the elementary course   but i i had an experience to know uhm to live with a taiwanese girl  uh but that taiwanese girl doesn't speak uhm english    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   oh  uhm   laughs  so everyday she forces me to to speak with her   in mandarin uhm so i ' ve i got to know mandarin but uhm not very good because uhm i share the stame the same problem with you  that ' s uhm i cannot talk to the mandarin people    uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm  maybe we can learn together   laughs    yeah yeah that ' s great yeah so yeah and uh uhm half of my classmate are japanese so   laughs we sometimes speak in japanese  oh have you thought of uhm learning cantonese   yes uhm yeah i want to to learn cantonese first but my friends uh told me uhm the hong kong is gonna be china in nineteen ninety-seven so you should learn mandarin  that ' s better than yeah cantonese   yes  i think uhm most of the chinese speak  mandarin  uhm yes but i ' ve i also think that cantonese is getting more important because in canton areas uhm i think most people speak cantonese  uh it ' s quite difficult to learn    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  yeah i think so too uhm  yes uhm  compare to mandarin maybe we have more uhm uh colloquial and also many uh tones two-words     uhm uhm  that ' s right so i hope uhm to learn uh cantonese be uh after finish the course of mandarin yeah  uh so how long does your course last   uh more than six month  more than six month     yeah  so so you ' ll be finishing that uhm quite soon   uhm uhm yeah that ' s right  and uhm  are you going to stay in hong kong after the course finish   i hope i hope but my parents  uh they they don't wish to my staying hong kong anymore   laughs  yeah my father uhm they are missing me very much so yeah  yes well i know that uhm to take up a new language is quite difficult  and it ' s uh yes because i learn japanese and it ' s already the the third year  but uhm my japanese is still very poor and i don't have the confidence to speak also     uhm uhm   uh ha   oh  but i heard uhm you have been learning japanese for th three years yes it ' s uhm nearly three years   and  laugh  yes from the first year when i uhm when i enter the university  i started to learn japanese uhm from the beginning level and right now i ' m the third year student  and i have still a few months to go and then   laughs school will kick me out   laughs  and then i have to work uhm i think learning japanese is a long  uhm we have a long long way to go because uhm it depends on my future career if i can get a job uh which allows me to have uh the opportunity to speak japanese then maybe my japanese will will become better  but if i if i if i work in uh government or bank  uh which requires uhm uhm no japanese maybe i ' ll forget everything  so i am now uh thinking of my career so i i should be very careful about it    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  so uh  how uhm  so i ' d like to know about your japanese uh uhm  so wah why did you take japanese course  uh it ' s a good question     yeah are you interested in japan or japanese or  something   oh  i think both  but uhm tut  actually uhm  in my secondary secondary school that is your high school  uh at that time i was uhm i was thinking to tut to study english to continue studying english literature  uhm but when i enter the university the school require me to uhm take uh four uh three or four courses so i had to take one more  and at that time because uhm most of my friends uhm they were they were thinking of japanese uhm as their minor and one reason is that i think uhm japanese is very practical and quite useful in my  career and also i like cartoons   laughs  yes you know cartoon songs   laughs  so uhm i think both  yes yes uhm right now i ' m crazy about one cartoon  that is slam dunk    both   uh ha i know   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   what ' s that  uh yeah   laughs  it ' s very popular in japan now uhm   uhm   yes  do you do you watch that tv    uhm   yeah i have  i ' ve yeah i watch that uhm several times   laughs  yeah but  i wonder we can watch the slam dunk in tv  uh  yes but not in uh japanese it ' s in cantonese now and uhm what time is it now six twenty five  so in six uhm thirty half past six so that ' s the slam dunk on uh at uhm i i forgot forget which channel but it ' s very interesting    no   oh   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  it ' s every night  uh yes actually i ' m i ' m watching it for the second time   uhm  yes   yeah uhm the younger generation generation uhm in japan uh also learn fraction fashion the style from slam dunk  fashion   yeah  but they ' re playing basketball   laughs    but uhm  yeah uhm  the you know it ' s the the black black people playing basketball  yes   uh in the states  uh   so the jap the japanese younger people  uhm want to wear like black people and also  playing basketball   yeah alright  yes and uhm in the programme there  there there is one guy  uhm who uhm who i like most   laughs  that is uh can you guess    uhm uhm  uhm which one i i remember two guys uhm is it  which colour uhm heap  blue hair   blue hair   laughs  is it blue that ' s hiro isn't he  uh i think his name is uhm bukarahin   bukaraki     uhm   kaki  it ' s the second character  second most important character    uhm  uhm so have you been to japan before  uh no  i haven't been there  because i think it ' s quite expensive  yes and  maybe after work after i i get out to work  and   laughs maybe i ' ll go there  i i ' d like to go there    no   uhm uhm   uh yes   uhm uhm   uhm yeah  yeah you should go yeah  yes but people say that if you uh if you don't bring enough money uhm you cannot but the clothes   laughs so will you  you ' ll feel you ' ll feel very sad about it   uhm yeah everything is quite expensive in japan yeah  so a lot of japanese woman come over to hong kong and buy anything they want to buy   laughs  yes i know  because uhm  actually in my second year of my study  uhm our school organized a trip to go to japan to study an intensive course for i think a few weeks  and uhm our department uhm we have about twenty people they went there last year  and when they came back uhm quite often they have to go to the the airport to receive the japanese friends    uhm   uhm uhm   uh ha   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uh  uhm   yes  they they come quite often to go shopping   uhm uhm  so you do a lot of shopping   in japan  in hong kong   yeah  but only uh bargain bargain season for two times a year summer or winter yeah  so you are waiting now   laughs    yeah so uhm yeah uhm have you got any japanese friend here   laughs  oh one  keiko     keiko   laughs  yes  i think  maybe we can meet uhm  even after this uh tape recording yes i must thank thank you to my teacher   laughs  mr bolton   laughs  so    uhm   uhm uhm  you will be my teacher of cantonese   laughs  yes yes i i love to yes yes one-word     really  yeah do you like dog   and  laugh  yes i like to watch the dogs    uhm uhm  you you would just just watch  yes i think they are very naughty   laughs  but   laughs  uhm but actually i ' m quite afraid of dogs  uhm  but this is okay this is small one  this is puppy    oh   yeah  she ' s only three month  three months     yeah  uh i like cats   like cats  oh   do you like it   yes i love  wha wha ouch   laughs aush  so do you have a dog at at home   except her  uh this is your dog   yes this is my dog   oh   laughs  i thought it is keiko keiko ' s dog   uh yeah uh she had  she had had before uh her brother but already die  yeah so so keiko told me uh she ' s been missing my dog because it ' s just so cute so today i brought her here and let keiko see   laughs   uh  yes uh uhm i think of something my friend uhm my friend previously she went to an interview  an interviewee ask ask her how do think about uh eating dogs    uhm uhm  so oh  in interview for what  job job interview  oh   uh it ' s   yes  job interview    si uh  eating dog   yes     but  i i heard cantonese could could be or  no  act actually in hong kong it ' s illegal     eat eat   uh yeah i know  but in china it ' s uhm quite common   laughs     hav hav have you try  yes   wow  but uh     tell me  only  only one bit one bit   uh ha   yes  and yes it was in my one-word in my childhood yes uh     uh  chow chow chow no  childhood yes when i was small  when i was uh still a young girl yes and because i have a relative she has a ho  she has his home in the new territories and it ' s a big house with a big garden  and he has lots of dogs  and large and small ones  and every year uh he will gather all the relatives there to have dinner to have party and uh   laughs     uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  and uh and  one one unfortunate dog will be will be killed uhm and be eaten by us but uhm  actually i i forgotten what what happen at that time but my mother ask me to to have a taste and and   but uhm  i wonder he is keeping the dogs for eat  uh uh i ' m i didn't ask that but i think uhm because uhm he also uhm he also has pigs  and the pigs are for selling  i think the dogs are for uhm uhm uhm are for keeping  keeping his house    oh pigs sell   uhm uhm   uhm  i think uhm   yes   and for keeping the pigs yes maybe   i think uhm the hong kong people likes keeping dog very much  yes the small one    uh  yes small one  yeah   yes   uhm uhm   yes     because uhm everywhere is very small only small flat so  but in many places uhm keeping dogs uh is not allowed such as in the public housing area  yes but uh people still ignore it    uh  uhm  why should are  yes you know when uh when the interviewee ask my friend such a question uh my friend answered oh do do what they want i don't care   laughs  because uh she doesn't like animals  but in my in my opinion i think people already have enough to eat  so i don't think they need to eat  uh cats such as in china dogs  and i personally i i don't like eating meat also    uhm   yes   uhm uhm  yeah i agree with you because uh sometimes uhm the the tv programme uhm shows us uhm the chinese market  there are a lots of puppy or cat yeah when i wa when i uh first saw them wow so cute but   laughs uh interviewer told us this this is for food   laughs  uh   yeah a long pause   laughs  she ' s a bit uhm so uhm do you plan uh to work for some company after graduate  after maybe   uh yes   yes of course  yes  uhm i think uhm  right now i think our work for for the whole for the whole of my life  i think even after i get marry if i can   laughs  because uhm  because i don't like cooking  and i don't do anything at home  but abo about uhm housework and which is uhm which is uh similar to my mother   uhm yes at home my father does a lots of housework he cooks and he wa uhm he washes uhm dishes   and  laugh  yeah so you are shocked about it    uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uh   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uh   wow   laughs  yes because uhm most of our japanese woman has to keep house  working after get marry  yeah   yes  i have heard of it   they they they should do  yeah   yes  but uhm when i tell uhm when when i tell my friends  my female friends  uh they all share   laughs  more or less the same opinion they all say that they all said that uh we cannot stay at home  uhm just uh to wait for our husband to come back and just uh watching tv just go shopping or play mahjong uh you know mahjong     uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   oh yeah  i know  yes uhm i think i like meeting people and meeting new things  and i can tell you that i i already uh grow tired of uh school life  after studying for two and half years uhm uhm i wants uhm i always want different environment and different people    so i don't think uhm i ' ll be a  uh i ' ll be a full time housewife    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm uhm uhm yes uhm  the the hong kong woman is very vividly yeah  yes independent and it ' s uh active    inde  uhm  yes uhm   and uh they looks very younger as their age   laughs   for they  yeah very  uhm   look younger   their age  really   yeah  oh maybe uhm because they don't put much make up on their face     uhm uhm  you know uhm i envious about you hong kong people  because  yeah you can work after get marry yeah   you  yes i i also feel lucky about it  uhm because uhm  maybe take for example  at home at my at uhm in my family uh i think uhm women have more power than men i have one brother  little brother and he ' s about eleven years old usually uhm my fa my my mother and i uhm we we together scold them   laughs everyday    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm uhm  wow  yes and my mother uhm is the main decision maker and she decides nearly everything   laughs  uhm about housing and school our school   uhm  yes i think uhm i ' m quite lucky   does your mother walks work too  no no   no  now she doesn't work  uhm but she still doesn't do much uh housework  she plays mahjong a lot she has a lot of friends yes actually uhm my mother ' s character is similar to me    we love making friends   laughs  and we love helping people    oh   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   ou  outgoing  yes quite outgoing  and yes we don't like uhm doing housework uhm  yes i remember that uhm in my secondary school there is a subject called home economics  uh which uh requires us to uh sometimes uh uh making a shirt and or uhm do some knitting    uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm   and  laugh  i remember that my result uhm wasn't was one of the poo uh the worst   laughs     the troublesome for you  yes   laughs   yes  i i prefer watching tv than doing housework    uhm   uhm  uh ha so a lot of hong kong woman hire maid  to avoid do doing house keeping   yes  yes yes  but we we need some money  but uh  i think uhm to hire a maid in hong kong uhm it takes about three to four thousand  dollars  hong kong dollars  a month yes    uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  but uh woman also can work uhm husband husband support her uh his wife yeah it ' s very lucky uhm  yes maybe you you should stay in hong kong   laughs    yeah i like to stay yeah for long time  but uhm  actually uhm women and men status is not uhm really equal  nowadays there is uhm there is still some inequality and and uhm some of my friends uh some of my male friends they still have the they still have the uhm the thinking that women should be subordinated to men and women should stay at home and woman should uh is uh weaker than men   laughs  and women is uhm uh should uh should be taken care by men    so i really tut i really don't like this kind of  people   laughs  i think they still uhm they still cannot accept the reality  and the  they seem uhm they seem that they ignore the fact also    why   uhm uhm   uhm  uhm but i think japanese man is more conservative yeah than other countries ' people yeah so  uhm a lot of guys want wife to be home and they ' ll take care of them and uhm   uh  yes that ' s really stupid  because uhm if you want to keep something at home  why don't you keep a pet instead of   and  laugh a wife  because uhm i think women uhm uhm also human being   i think they should be respected  and also and i think if everyday if you go home  looking at your wife uhm after staying at staying at home for a whole day and uhm not uhm getting getting in touch with the outside world i think men will will very very soon grow tired of the woman  so i think they are really stupid why don't you why don't they let let their wife uhm get in touch with uhm the world and have more topics to share with them    uhm   uhm uhm   yeah   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm so uhm you think  the woman ' s status is not high enough   well     in hong kong  i think it depends uhm it depends on the environment or situation i think uhm if uh if women go to work uhm maybe i don't know yet  because i ' m still a student  i think uhm the status is more or less equal  but at home because uhm the thing is still man orientated   yes and when you give uh give birth to a child the child will uh will have their surname after uhm the father  uhm and it ' s seem that uhm  only man can inherit the property uh from the  family    uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   two-words   uhm   uhm   uh  really  in many families  and uhm  i don't know what what will happen to myself  but uhm when i look around at my at my  relatives  uhm after the daughters uh get married uhm they treat uhm their hus their husband ' s home uh their husband ' s uhm mother and father as their their  hus uh their father also and when they get home they seem to be an outsider sometimes and when the when the fa  uhm when when their father and mother die it seems that only men can share the the property    oh   uhm uhm   uh ha   uhm uhm  oh i didn't expect that situation because my friend told me uhm  the wife the wife also working so they got money uhm to buy property so uhm the uhm how can we say uhm  but money is the woman  the woman ' s itself herself  yes but what i mean is uhm for example uhm when my when uhm when one ' s father and mother die  uhm and they will  they will give all their money to to their son  only     uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  that ' s same as in japan
