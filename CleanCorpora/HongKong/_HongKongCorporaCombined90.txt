hey actually uhm ming call uh i was talking with ming today   uhm uhm  and uhm she mentis uh she asked me if i if i could uh if i would be free on on friday   to do what  to to do uhm the or to to to be one of the guys looking looking after you guys   on friday   ah for the for the for the community service project   oh  do you know   no  the one which you     oh on the seventh  oh no no no not not the coming saturday yeah i got messed up  the coming saturday is tomorrow   so uh tomorrow  no no no uh next saturday no next tut friday what did i say did i say saturday   friday  okay yeah next friday uh a week from tomorrow   oh eleventh right  ah yes yeah   we ' ll go to chi-lin community school  yeah   oh so you will go  no i couldn't because 2 words i have school until until like   oh you are not missing a lot several words it will just be pretty boring i think  no but uh but the the place that you guys are going   yeah  uhm i haven't been there before one word   and i heard that it was like a really neat uhm place the the temple i mean do you know    oh  but i ' m not sure if we ' ll go to the temple we ' ll go to some school that maybe the school is part of the temple i ' m not sure  oh  okay   it ' s like a school for students i ' m not sure if it ' s in the one word    uh huh  it ' s oh it ' s a primary school or something   no maybe i ' m not sure  okay   i don't know more than you do but we have some meeting on the seventh about it so then i can tell you  oh   but never mind you can't go yeah but i have questions  yes   oh many many questions  really laughs    many no i just have one thing okay uhm i talked to daisy  yeah   uh that we want to make like a t-shirt for ourselves like for all the students right  oh laughs and she told you to ask me because   she told you that she told me that you you know a girl called something like iris or something like that  or celia  celia   celia  yeah   she also goes attends the college the university of hong kong  yeah   and uh and she knows someone  yeah and actually i kno i know i know that one too   oh really then i don't have to go through celia  yeah   uhm well anyway  you know   you know the any idea how much it is or what  less than thirty if you if you want yeah if you want a t-shirt like the the afs t-shirt that now you guys have    thirty  yeah  actually i did that one   uh huh  yeah   what you did the design  no no no no uh uh actually the the the the ordering and all that all that crap   oh really  yeah it was one word because because when when afs did that   yeah  it was like a uhm a lot of work because they they they need a lot of of work uh of t-shirts    uh huh uh huh  work yeah  lots of lots and lots of t-shirts then   of course  and then i i had to to uh the place was in shum shui po and then   yeah so far   but never mind i i don't want to to talk too much but uh   but  but yeah i still i still have the have the contact of that place then     i ' ll i ' ll tell you what i imagine that we would want  uhm uhm   it ' s like a collage you know what a collage is  uh forgot    laughs it ' s like a i don't know kind of a collection of pictures stuck on one page  uh huh   like probably the normal paper size like a four size  uh huh   and on it i don't know i want to like make some pictures of us and you know some afs logo and maybe  i don't i ' m not really sure  what else  like maybe something like mtr ticket or something to remember hong kong   uh huh  yeah   and like some hong kong letters or something  yeah   and uh so in that way we would uh it would be like a front design and that would come on the front of the shirt  uh huh   do you think that ' s possible  uh yes i think so uh but uh it would be another kind of uh printing i would say uh because the   yeah it would it would probably be more expensive a pause  uh i ' m not sure but uh they they are going to i think they are going to make it into  because the the one that like the one that that afs now has   yeah  uh is uh when they when they make the the picture   yeah  uh they have a frame and then they just uh they have a frame that that had you know cut out and then then they just put the uh color one color by one color and then     yeah yeah yeah yeah  on top of the white t-shirt then but then for for for the one that you are talking about i think they are going to to make uh  another kind of   yeah i ' m sure so because uh okay i ' ll tell you why i think it ' s possible first of all i know it ' s possible cos one girl  did that in czech republic as a present for a friend   three words kind of thing and uh secondly you can always see know how they print photographs on t-shirts and stuff   yeah it it is possible   yeah   yes   yeah uh huh   so i i ' m sure it ' s like possible i i ' m just not sure where how and how much you know  the price  the the price shouldn't be like sky high i think because   well i guess we ' re like willing to pay up to like seventy dollars or something  no no no no i don't think i don't think it would be  well the because because uh how uh the one the the  no the the production or the the actual co cost for the for the one that afs is selling    uhm uhm  yeah  uh is i think less than thirty   yeah how much were they selling it for  i don't know   because i bought mine but that was in september and there was a different one there was the old one  oh the old one they  the old one wasn't the the the old one had a another  very complicated story   oh right  it wasn't it wasn't really afs thing    uh huh   it was uh the the t-shirt of something called afs fun fun club   uh  i don't know if if you you have heard of that but that that thing just some afs returnees trying to to get something a accomplished but didn't quite work out at the end    uh  i paid like seventy dollars  yes that one that one i think it cost seventy dollars because they were they were trying to to make a profit out of that    jesus  ah  and then because that   profit organization  yes before because that so-called fun club did uh is not working anymore  2 words not work anymore but they have an account uh   okay  that the afs doesn't know how to uh the office actually doesn't know how to how to get how to get the like they they actually i don't think they are doing anything with the money they just keeping it for the fun club   yeah  still   well it doesn't matter  yeah   they will use it somehow but that ' s funny yep anyways that ' s uh   uhm yeah uh uh let me s see uh the i think you uh do you think you guys can uh  could have a like a draft of the of the whole picture   oh like a draft  yeah   oh well i guess it will be just easier if i just do the thing straight away you know what i mean  uh huh you you can do that   well yeah  okay   but i would need some time maybe  uhm uhm   to collect like some of the things like a little map of hong kong and you know things like that  uhm uhm   so i could do it definitely yeah  uh oh yeah maybe maybe it would it would i just remember maybe because you are probably not going to make a whole lot of t-shirts so it may it might be     it might be more expensive for each one   yeah yeah    i know i know we ' ll probably make like thirty or something but we ' ll see i i have to write to the to all the kids and  yeah   and we should also maybe like get a design competition or something too much too much trouble  do you think do you think it uh or is there is there any of you are good at that   in design  yeah   no i can do that i i i ' m quite good in design and i i don't really want like a big design. it ' s like a collage which is easy to make and i have a good idea of how to make it so i wouldn't be that worry about it but uhm   uh huh  that ' s good   but i just hope they will like it in the end laughed  uhm uhm   but you know i i ' m thinking you know that maybe everyone will have like will want to get one maybe for their first friends or want to get some for the office and you know support contacts and things like that so we might all like we we may get it up to maybe  fifty sixty  yeah   so that already could be a little cheaper  unless afs wants to sell them and make for profit so they could like get two hundred copies or something both-laugh   uhm uhm    uh well i don't know maybe because maybe they do maybe they will and i you know i ' m not sure don't worry we will just get like sixty or something like that and  that ' s okay   uhm uhm  uhm   uh i ' ll have to maybe start  yeah   so i ' ll start like doing the design and i ' ll start writing to people about it  how about that   uhm uhm  yeah and uh and when you get it done i can i can go to the place with you   oh very nice  that would be great   then we ' ll find the cost and everything   uh huh   yeah  yeah uh that place is is in shum shui po   yeah  oh closer to me than to you huh   laughed yeah yep   okay  are you still are you still doing your uh jeet kune do   yeah yeah but i must admit i haven't been there for a while  yeah   i ' ve been to beijing and  huh huh   there ' s also been something last time i was in china so  i ' ll be going in sunday again   huh huh  oh   yeah that ' s in shum shui po  you got a memory   yeah  uhm uhm so uh was was that your that ' s all your question   yeah i think so  that ' s about it cos then i i might have like more but i i guess i could get like also other people to help so you are not like the busiest guy in the world  $a laughs  we ' re going to need to print a yearbook   aw  uh sorry   we are going to need to print a yearbook  uh huh yeah   so uhm is it a yearbook or an yearbook it should be a yearbook right   an  a yearbook   it ' s funny that it ' s a yearbook cos it ' s a book a pause  why   you can educate me why is it a yearbook and not an yearbook  yearbook starts with a y  because a e a e i o u     oh it ' s a year is it a special exception  hmm no no actually uh i think i think most of the cases  just uh words start with the letters a e i o u the vowel   yeah  or or in some cases would if you say mtr you mtr station you would say an mtr station because   wow that ' s true  m is like if you if you want to s to spell it it would be am or em   yeah yeah   uhm and   but yearbook is strange   yearbook yearbook   yearbook is   you even say in a year in about a year   in about  yeah   wow very strange  i i think it ' s it ' s like because may maybe because y is a  i think i think it ' s called a semi-vowel or something   uh huh  so they they just don't   that ' s possible  don't see it as a real vowel   yeah probably  hey you know yesterday night it was it was quite interesting i i went uhm i went with uh with a lot of a f afs people   uh huh  uh to to uh one of the afs board members   afs what  board members one of one of uh    who  uh uh her name is anne forrest   and  anne forrest like forrest gump forrest   anne forrest that ' s a girl  yeah   it ' s a woman  yeah   it ' s american  yeah   oh i think i saw her at the at the volunteer forum or something  ah yeah could be i uhm because i i ' ve never seen any any of the board member   oh really  except daniel ng the the laughed  the mcdonald man and and and and iris iris and   debbie yeah    yeah   iris yeah  oh debbie ' s on the board i didn't know that  yeah   oh i know i know debbie i know iris i know some american guy  oh tom the very big like a very tall guy   he is kind of tall kind of old though so maybe it ' s a different one i forgot his name but he had a rather strange name so if you said it i will remember  oh   he ' s like some busine business man kind of guy  really   yeah anyways him and uh   uhm uhm  daniel   daniel yeah i met daniel and yeah so uh i ' m sure some one more person but never mind uh huh   so what what did you guys do  uh we we had a really uh big dinner because ther  there were so many people   yeah how many  uh i think there were like twenty of them of us   wow  uh the uh the whole staff was there   oh really  yeah uh and then and then   tara boyce  yeah yeah she organized the whole thing   oh  uh with with anne forrest uh  and daniel was there and then the the guy that i was i was mentioning tom i think i think his last name is masterson or something    yeah  oh  something ending with son   oh i ' m not sure  i don't know   yeah  and and then some volunteers uh but most of them are like the ad adults volunteers   yeah daisy   no     she ' s in south africa  yes   oh  yes but uh shelby was there   shelby was there  eddie was there   yeah  sorry   eddie  uh shelby said eddie was sick   oh i see  yeah but we we all thought she was lying   oh okay both-laugh  yeah uhm and the the young the young uh returnees or the young volunteers eddie shelby i    oh  yeah  uhm john   oh john really  yeah   oh cos he ' s in the he ' s going to take over the world right  $a laughed together with mr chan  yeah and also gloria gloria do you know    ngh sik cantonese for ' don't know ' no oh uh she she is the she is the the girl in the poster   oh that one yeah i never met her  uh huh yeah uh yeah oh actually i should know because i know she she has never met you   oh okay  yeah sorry laughed yeah i always i always tell her that uh she should meet you guys   oh  but she several words and too shy   okay  yeah   and so what did you do why was it interesting  uh well first of all because it was uh somewhere  up in the hill one word like   on the peak  yeah close to the peak very much close to the like the big thing at the peak    yeah  oh how nice  and then so the house was like really big and   yeah  really fancy   cool  uh and and what else and and then we we got to to talk quite quite a lot with each other and i don't know i think i think i always or i just feel it was really neat to  to actually finally get to meet   yeah  these board members   oh sounds nice  oh actually uh i just remember i i i did meet  like another uh board member before   oh  but it was it was just like a very brief thing and oh she wouldn't and i don't think she would remember     oh yeah and i met yeah i met this called   wah ' wah ' is a cantonese exclamation mei-sie  ah like a a chinese uh   she ' s malaysian  uh huh yeah uh she she but she wasn't there last night she she was supposed to be there but she had something else    oh  oh i see yeah she ' s very nice i think  uh and another person was supposed to be there but suddenly couldn't come was uh virginia   one word     virginia oh i don't know her  she works at the american consulate   oh that ' s right  yup and she she is the one she is the one that i was talking about that i ' ve met before because     oh okay  uh i once time to deliver some something   uh  to her   how come the members are americans or something huh  yeah laughs  i don't know  $z laughs  it ' s yeah but   never mind yes so did you discuss anything interesting  uhm no   no did they say how good we are  uh you mean you guys   yeah  yeah   of course  $a laughs we are very good  yeah  $a laughs    any personal qualities mentioned no never mind i ' m not that particularly curious so  uh no   of course not okay  yeah but but uh i think some of them will will go to you know there there there will be another thing coming up in june  uh i think it ' s the date is june sixteenth   oh  uh huh maybe maybe you know it already but uh it ' s like some celebration   oh it ' s the appreciation dinner   for for for the whatever yeah   yeah yeah  uh it ' s yeah and and then and then yes some of them will be there and and and you guys uh because uh ming mentioned that you guys will be doing something   oh no they just made it up i guess they just want us i ' m sure it ' s like another performance it ' s i ' m just so sick of it by now  really   yes because it ' s like what do they keep constantly expecting us to do it ' s like   uh huh   we ' ve been in we ' ve been asked like already like four times or five times to make a performance  uh huh   this is like so tiring  oh   every time you have to think of something  yep huh huh   it ' s just like we that that ' s why like you know we make like quite some we put some effort into the one on on the volunteer dinner  yeah   we practiced for it you know and came up with ideas and everything  yeah   but then we were asked to do another one for christmas you know  oh uh huh   and like it was supposed to be all in cantonese too. and then it was just like we didn't get any idea of what to do and it was like crap  oh   and then uh in beijing they also wanted us to do something and they just always want us to do a performance  $a laughed  so we ' ll just like well i guess we ' ll make one like  for the end for like of course but i don't know what it will be and i ' m not sure  uhm uhm     if it ' s gonna be fun  we ' ll see we ' ll see  yeah   plus we ' ll have the orientation before that you know  uh huh and like on the tenth right   no i thought it comes together  oh really oh i i didn't know because uh uh last time i heard it was   oh really  tenth of june   oh i ' m not sure   which was a which is a sunday oh so you several words saturday     maybe the appreciation one word   is also there  sorry   maybe the appreciation evening is also that day  sixth the tenth   yeah  no no sixteenth uh it ' s it ' s confirmed just confirmed uh the other day   so i don't know about that   like last week this week yeah   oh very interesting uhm  so yeah so you you don't have school tomorrow   no school  no school on monday   no school just lazing around oh today i met up with john after school  jonathan or john     yeah jonathan  okay   we had so much time you know  uh huh   like now that we finish at one thirty  yeah   so uh he finishes at one  yeah   bastard  yeah saint saint paul is is particularly late in in terms of summer summer school schedule   late  yes like one thirty-five or one thirty   one thirty  yeah   that ' s okay  but pretty late   well i know that who is it sora the swedish sora  uh huh   she ends at like two thirty that would that ' s the change to their summer schedule  but then they do they do they get a summer a  lunch break   i don't know maybe   they probably do   probably yeah  but then two words it would be the same   i ' m pretty hungry at one thirty three words    yeah that that is that is what what i was talking about like yeah and and like for me   yeah  when i was in in saint paul ' s uh for summer school   yeah  i got at i got back home at like two past two  okay and then i had my lunch    uh huh  oh really  yeah   but it ' s quite normal to eat at two or so it looks like in in in the europe at least for me it ' s quite normal  oh   but now i ' m used to you know eat at twelve thirty so  uhm uhm   one thirty is a little different plus we didn't get like  i don't know  we have two breaks and they are so short you can't even buy anything  $a laughs  i don't want to spend my money so i ' m just not eating anything   break   yeah   yeah   oh you you don't usually you don't uh  buy anything during the break the the break     usually not because first of all i feel so stupid in the line   laughs yeah   but i stand out like i stick out like all these little kids are  one word   yeah i i know what you are talking about   i really hate it  uh huh   and uh then i kind of i don't know i don't really like the stuff they have  oh   it ' s not healthy it ' s like crap  yeah   and but sandwich is pretty good but i just basically don't like to spend my money  uh huh   it ' s better to eat less and do more exercise right  yes   you see $a laughs there we go so now i just wait for lunch till like one thirty and it ' s actually good because then it ' s easier to wait till like eight for dinner   huh huh  yeah   cos you know before it was always like terrible when like last food i had is like one o'clock  yeah   and then i have to wait until eight  eight thirty   yeah for seven hours without any food  that ' s pretty frustrating  oh sorry i got you carried away from the from the stuff that you were talking about with john   oh never mind  $a laughs  yeah so anyway we met up  yeah   and that was quite nice because we wanted to like take a little tour of hong kong  wow where where were you guys   we just wanted to see a bit more so we went to the flower mar  no not the flower the the bird market  uh huh the place is in mongkok   yeah it ' s in prince edward  ah uh huh   it ' s on the boundary street  uhm uhm   so we went there and you know to check out the speech inaudible due the loud music and then we also wanted to see the jade market but that was closed  uh huh   but this as it was too late it close at like around two three or something  oh   by the time we got there  i thought it opened late oh it close late actually   oh really  maybe i don't read my guide properly   i i don't know i ' ve only been there once in my whole life   oh really  yeah   oh i i ' ve never been there so i might check it out later    uh huh   we have time time so much time now  $a laughs 2 words i love it anyway so uhm so we just uh went to check it out and then cos the jade market was closed we went to see the chung king man mansion yeah   so that was fun but i mean what is there to do there i didn't really know we just kind of walks around and then   did you did you go into any shops or anything   yeah but there wasn't much to buy  oh   then we just like went up to the seventeenth floor and went like a few stories down  uh huh seventeenth floor is like a special place is it   no just a normal guest house we just look in there and then we went like to fifteenth floor thirteenth floor and from eleventh we saw it was not very exciting and nothing different   okay  uh huh   so we just took the elevator back down  but it was still during the day right   huh  it was still during the day   yeah yeah why  i think no i don't know  may   i just have a feeling that it ' s it ' s a whole  lot different place if you go at night but i wouldn't go at night though    three words  you wouldn't go  hey because because it ' s supposed to be dangerous   really what ' s there  uh   prostitution and stuff like that uh like gangsters  a pause  i don't i don't know exactly what what they have there but   oh  maybe maybe a lot of uh well for for quite sure they they have a lot of illegal immigrants there    yeah i thought several words i thought the people there were rather nice there actually they were singing in the elevator and  oh uh huh   and they were like friendly and and i thought they were nice they were like usually indians pakistanis or like  africans   yeah and they are usually nice i think  uh huh   so that ' s what i feel  so that that that was where you guys ended up   yes well then we yeah then we walked around tsim sha tsui  uh huh   like the the area that we didn't go to before like the  rather like the east side of tsim sha tsui  oh   so uh that was nice  uh huh so are you guys going to like uh one place at a time and check it out   i guess we got so much time but then one word i i i can't figure what else is there to see you know so if you have some advice let me know because it seems like i have seen it all  uh where like chung king mansion you mean   no i mean yeah like the urban hong kong  oh uhm   what did you mean one at a time  uh one area   oh  like today you you you guys went to tsim sha tsui, yau ma tei and   yeah uhm well i guess maybe i don't know i don't know cos we ' ve seen lot of it you know we know a lot already so   uh  yeah   so it ' s hard to tell  $a laughs  i ' ve been everywhere maybe not  uhm well i i ' m i ' m thinking    approaching the outlying islands like the  yeah   the special small ones where you ' ll have to take a ferry that only goes like twice a day i really want to go to one of those but it ' s kind of hard  no no i don't think it ' s that hard actually i uh you can  i think they uh you can get the well maybe that that would be boring uh because uh at one time i almost went with my uh parents   uh huh  to uh i think the most northeast island in hong kong   oh is it cheung ping or something like that   uh    ping  ping yeah ping chau name of an outlying island of hong kong  ping chau   ping chau yeah  yeah but yeah but or maybe some people call it uh east ping chau or dong ping chau   uh huh  because there is another one another ping chau   oh  uh near lantau   oh no i mean this one the one close to china  yeah yeah yeah uh yeah that uh you you are right uhm   oh yeah that ' s what i want to go to actually  yeah and and and and that time when i almost did go   uhm uhm  uh we were uh we were thinking about joining some like one day tour   uhm uhm  but i don't know how uhm what they what they actually do for that one day tour do they let people go on their own or   i definitely wouldn't want to do that  yeah oh   i think it ' s quite easy according to my lonely planet in a way but it ' s just like too hard to organize the people and on the you know like get the ferry ticket and everything you need to get that   in advance i think   oh  talking about ferry uh the other day or i think yesterday uh aldi mentioned about uhm  she was thinking about organizing something    yeah   uhm uhm  uhm uhm  like a day one day thing to macau   yeah  did you heard about th uh hear about that   yeah she does want to do that i know  yeah and then and then but but the weird thing was she was asking me uh if i if i knew or if i had the number of some kowloon or some ferry company in kowloon laughs    oh i ' m no sure i ' m sure there is some in my in my guidebook and i can give her my number  oh but but but then i i i thought uh if you want to go to macau like most people would just go to   the ferry terminal  yeah in   and buy tickets there  in in sheung wan or in in central or or or but but then but then most people would would end up getting on the ferry there   yeah  which is in central or sheung wan near like in between sheung wan and central   i know where it is i went to chung shan from there  uh huh yeah yeah that that ' s the place uhm and   hong kong ferry terminal  yeah and then uh but but then but then uh some people can can or or a lot of people would go to travel agency  some smaller ones and they and they they sell like a package like    uhm uhm  uh huh  uh together with uh ferry ticket and also uh hotel stay for like one night or two nights they have all all kind of all sorts of deals and    uhm   yeah we will just go for one day  yeah and like and like i think like last year the uh  the simon   yeah  uh the the german student   yeah  uh he went he went on one of those things and it was like seven hundred for two nights i think or one night   uhm uhm  which which sounded very cheap to me   oh  including the the the ferry ticket   oh who did he go with  uh i think he went with two other exchange students.   oh  just two of them   was it a secret trip  uh no i don't think so   cos i think we are not allowed to go for longer than like one day anywhere out of hong kong  oh okay then it ' s a secret it was secret trip   really  i don't know uh i because at first i heard of uh  like afs was not going to let let them to do that but but somehow they ended up doing it so i thought maybe they they they got permission or something   very interesting maybe not huh
