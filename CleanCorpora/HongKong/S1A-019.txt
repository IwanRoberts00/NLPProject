""
you know i  ' m really glad
""
i  ' m going to be out of job by  april
 
""
what year  laugh  
""
""
next year    laugh  
 
""
 oh   
""
""
because i  ' ve learned something more today
 
""
yes 
""
""
we had a training and then there were some information shown to
us about  what this world  ' s like what this world  ' s like in the  in
the in the future
""
it  ' s sort of horrifying  of people who stay in a country like
this you know
""
not like this but for people who  ' s staying and working a job in an
organization
 
""
oh and they  think that  to  impress to show you that you  ' re
lucky    people  you come    
""
they  ' re buying their way out 
   laugh   
""
 no  
""
that  ' s not true
""
that  ' s why one of the way 
""
i think you know one of the way out is to  set up my own
business  in a this is  you just  one-word  this in
a  stage 
 
""
who told you that
""
nu skin or apl 
""
""
a  bl
""
it doesn't matter
""
it just
 
""
abl or apl
""
you work for   apl  not abl 
""
""
 apl  
""
apl 
""
the visitor said their show is 
""
the americans now are working on average  okay a hundred and
forty hours more  than before
""
and there will be fifteen more percentage of layoff  and all
these layoff will happen in the management levels because all the companies
are going to be layered and there  ' s no more managers and no more directors
""
and it turn out for all the companies are getting rid of the 
its management  heads you know 
""
so i guess i  ' m really lucky you know
 
""
why are you lucky 
""
""
because i  ' m the first one to go    laugh  
 
""
 oh   i see
""
you  ' re very optimist 
""
""
and i  two words  package you know
""
and they talk about at&t you know the company at&t
 
""
uhm 
""
""
they just laid off uh seventeen thousand people of which
fourteen thousands are managers
""
do you  believe it 
 
""
wow 
""
""
yeah 
""
it  ' s really quite amazing because now the model of business has
changed  and the entire business world has changed
""
and  in a new company there is no more chain of command you know
""
there is no more pyramid structure and just like that
""
all the companies i know of actually like apl they  ' re moving
towards a very  mobile structure very  one-word 
structure
""
so no managers are  immediately  required  in the future
 
""
you can specialize in training companies to make the move and then
 one-word  from one company to the other
""
that can keep you go on for ten years 
""
""
and you know what they   are saying 
 
""
 as a   consultant 
""
""
as there there  ' s a guy called peter drucker who wrote some
very famous business books and  he says 
""
he  ' s just revised his forecast you know
""
when he wrote that book uhm  i forgot re-engineering the company
 or something like that
 
""
the what company  two words  
""
""
re-engineering the company
 
""
oh 
""
""
and  when he first wrote the book uhm maybe a couple of
years back he was predicting thirty percent of the managers would be gone
""
and now he  ' s just revised the figure to fifty percent of the
managers would be gone  in the near future
""
so managers that are remaining are really  focusing on
something that is that is totally different from what they used to  handle
before 
""
you know what they deal with is just to manage change because
change is going to happen everywhere in a company and the magnitude and the
speed is only going to increase and it  ' s not going to slow down
""
so managers are only required to co-ordinate them you know
""
give people support and it  ' s funny they  they cannot predict
what skills are required in the future 
""
you want to know what skills are required in the future  for
managers to to survive 
""
first of all they have to have a second language because he said
because of the  technologies available  telecommunications everything
is available people are competing jobs not only within their own country
""
for example americans are not just competing jobs with their within
america
""
because  ther 
""
for us for example we are competing  1-word 
together so those who have a second language  is going to outwin  the
other 
""
i have two languages maybe two and a half languages
""
i speak a little bit of france  laugh  french now  laugh
""
""
i claim
""
i will claim that i speak a little bit of french
 
""
why
""
 pourquoi  
""
""
 pourquoi  parce que  
a-words-in-french 
 
""
ah  oui  
""
""
no no we  ' ll talk english not in france
""
not in french 
""
so this is how  it all  showed up in the statistics
""
and being a manager is not easy
""
i mean before they can just use their authority and you know
exercise their power you know as long as they stay well in the politics
""
they  they  ' ll survive but these days not any more 
""
going to be quite tough in the business world
 
""
uhm uhm
""
what else do they gonna be required of these guys 
""
""
what else
 
""
you said two languages but that  ' s not all 
""
""
oh that  ' s not all of course
""
there are other things you know
""
to be able to be uh to be able to adapt to change figure out things
and change you know 
""
everything is changed
""
i  ' m glad
""
you know   two-words 
 
""
don't cry darling
""
are you crying 
""
""
i  ' m not crying
 
""
okay 
""
""
i  ' m just trying to find out what was  rea  written in
my notes
 
""
 nuts 
""
did you say notes or  nuts  
""
""
notes
 
""
you said note 
  two words 
""
it  ' s funny you know 
""
i think people are getting 
""
okay
""
the other thing that managers are required is to become  expert
in confronting the touchy issues you know inter-personal issues only at the
 multiple words 
""
oh
""
my goodness
""
sorry wrong wrong notes
 
""
that  ' s your writing
""
you  several-words   both laugh  
""
""
my writing 
""
i  ' m human
""
what do you expect
 
""
 multiple words  
""
""
i am a human
 
""
you  ' re lying 
""
""
human being
 
""
define a human being 
""
""
human beings have  have  feelings and emotions and
thoughts and mistakes
 
""
 multiple words  
""
""
""
$a laughed 
""
and mistakes they  ' re not perfect
""
i  ' m not perfect
""
you  ' re not perfect
""
no one is perfect 
""
that  ' s the reality
""
oh
 
""
quite a speech  
$a laughs 
""
""
what else is there
 
""
 multiple words  
$a laughed 
""
 three words  
""
""
 one-word 
""
and also you know 
""
i can't find it  laugh 
""
i wrote it down  three words  read for myself
""
and i can't find it because i find it very interesting 
three words  job
""
and in fact i  ' m not not interested in working in  a job like
this but i  ' m interested in making studies about all these  things you
know
 
""
you consultant
""
a consultant    multiple words  
""
okay listen
""
as a consultant you  ' re working for these people
""
the knowledge goes through you
""
you accumulate the knowledge
""
you  ' re making    multiple words 
 
""
yeah
""
you you  ' ll be learning a you know
""
and you will be    
""
yes including 
""
""
 whatever you call it 
""
the one consultant  / { 1>
""
 something like that  
""
 of course i am learning  
""
okay
""
one of three you want to know what uh this uh of what goes in
before i can be a manager
 
""
uhm 
""
""
additional language
""
technical competency
""
that means if you don't know computer or anything else you  ' d
better be quick 
""
and the extraordinary people still you know have to be very very
good in handling people issues because all they have  in the future is
handling change
""
and change  affects people affects people  ' s mind affects
affects people  ' s emotion and affect people  ' s productivity and they have to
be very very good in that 
""
and they will be able to they are  flexible  they can work
as a team member a team player team leader and whatever angle you know 
when  whenever the situation arise they will just have to jump in and
help out 
""
very interesting you know 
""
and the training also mentions something about networking which is
going to lead to success
 
""
networking 
""
""
networking 
""
the power of networking
""
and  it it encourages all the people  to use more in
networking to minimize or increase actually to increase the predictability of
all these changes because you get information from people
""
now information is getting more and more powerful because of the
availability of  telecommunication 
""
this will give you an example you know
""
they mention about  the change in the transportation industry
""
""
are you listening
 
""
 two words  
""
that was french for yes
""
 two words 
""
okay    one-word   
""
""
 great  
""
just to  tell you the change is  trans  in
transportation
""
before no eight  at year six thousand before christ people were
riding on the camels and they were going at the speed of eight miles per hour
""
do you remember that
 
""
yes i remember 
""
""
okay
""
so in the year two thousand b c something was invented
 
""
the wheel 
""
""
yeah and they were going at twenty miles per hour and 
that was  a duration of four thousand years  '  development they  can 
increase the speed from eight  miles per hour to two to twenty miles per
hour
""
and then 
 
""
 laugh 
""
 multiple words    both laughed 
""
""
and then at eight hundred is it eight hundred
""
anyway and then we invented the locomotive you know and they were
going  a hundred miles per hour
""
all happened  in hundreds and thousands of years before people
invent the next thing
""
but from the year one nine one nine three zero in the nineteen
thirty the plane was  invented
""
aeroplanes were invented and they were going at four hundred miles
per hour compared to one hundred per miles per hours 
""
that  ' s an increase of three  hun  three times four times
 the speed okay
""
however  at the same time nineteen-sixty  they invented the
space capsule and the space capsule was going at a rate of how   fast
""
 
""
 twenty   five thousand miles 
""
""
eighteen thousand miles per hour
""
so all these things  and also information and knowledge is
exploding everywhere
""
if we look at the same time line  before you know in uh in the
year of one five zero zero there were less than one thousand books published
in europe per year
""
but in nineteen fifty a hundred and twenty thousand books were
published in one year
""
and in nineteen sixty just only ten years after three hundred
fifty thousand books per year
""
can you imagine all these books
""
all these information that people need 
""
and they  ' re predicting what we know of today will be completely
   out of date  in twenty months
""
so  the statistic is saying that every twenty years the
scientific knowledge doubles 
""
horrifying isn't it 
""
reminds me i  ' d better get on with my computer more 
""
stop using my secretary
 
""
 obsolete  
""
you would  get on with your computer more 
""
""
yeah
""
i've been relying on my secretaries for a long time because they  ' re
 very comfortable 
""
 i don't need    to do my 
 
""
 but you would   have to ask uh   two
words  
""
""
well the secretaries can handle the phone calls 
""
i  ' m becoming more  hands on now with you know doing things of
my own like letters and things like that  because i think it  ' s and it  ' s
fun as well you know in learning the computer these days
""
it  ' s very user-friendly  long pause 
 
""
you needed this 
""
""
uhm
 
""
it  ' s still one  one-word  variety in addition
to this
""
 multiple words  
""
""
no i just
 
""
you  multiple words  
""
""
i don't think i am going to
""
i  ' m i  ' m not going to be a consultant 
""
i  ' m just i  ' ll probably be just working on some  project that
i like
 
""
 two words  
""
""
that is only you know projects that will fit my  my uh
desire you know if the company is interested
 
""
oh but it  ' s very  multiple words  
""
""
i don't know
""
 six words 
 
""
oh  multiple words  
""
okay
""
more speech 
""
""
more speech   sneeze 
""
excuse me
 
""
oh bless you 
$a laughs 
""
i like the 
$a laughs  just  just sneeze again
""
 three words 
""
okay
""
one more 
""
""
it  ' s too hot
""
there  ' s no air   in this place 
 
""
 okay go on   
""
""
okay
 
""
alright 
""
""
and  it tells us how to  respond to all those changes
that is going on in this world you know
""
the changes going on in the business world
""
something
""
it talks about something that is very interesting 
""
one of the suggestions is to you know in order to maintain the
flexibility so that we can go through all these changes is get out of debt
and stay out of debt 
""
that means no more  borrowing money from the bank 
""
if you have a house sell it keep the money
 
""
who  ' s going to buy the house  two-words  
""
""
oh somebody  ' s going to keep the house of course
""
they can rent it on the  one-word  
""
it  ' s the very pessimistic  prediction of to some  in 
""
to a certain extent i think it  ' s quite true because the world is
really changing and the technology is rapidly taking place of the human being
""
""
but uh one thing that i  ' m glad to know is human resources is
because of this situation is highly in demand 
""
a lot of people issues need to be dealt with
""
and if people issue need to be addressed 
""
and i  ' ve just read another book you know the the the book that i  ' ve
just bought the  one-word  prophecy or something like that
 
""
you read the whole book 
""
""
no i read some part of it and it  ' s talking about uhm 
""
it was a kind of mystical but it mentions something uh it  ' s like
 a uhm
""
they  ' ve found something as the rule and the  something like
the prophet saying or something like that
""
it talks about the  the future world
""
it  ' s kind of  vaguely related to this  piece that i was
been talking
""
because the future world they say it  ' s going people are  going
through tough times and people  will finally realize that they have to go
through  some spiritual growth and unite together and go  go into a
warm spiritual world 
""
i don't know what i  ' m talking
""
i  ' m so sleepy 
""
""
""
okay
""
what do you want to know
 
""
what i want to want to know
""

""

""
""

""

 uhm either going to  ocean park or  you know a beach or a
recreation park in sai kung
 
""

""
""
usually we have thirty of these children and they

""

""

""
""

""

""
""
nine o'clock it started  raining  but the actual
playing time is around eleven to four 
""
and uh  a lot of fun playing with the kids that you don't speak
their language 
""
uhm  uhm  because  they  ' ve never been out
""
only a very few times they would have been out of from the camp
""
some of them are born in the camp  so they get sick on the bus
and they throw up everywhere
""
you have to pass the plastic bag to them
""
   two- words  
 
""
 the what bag   
""
""
plastic bag 
""
sick bag and then you wipe them clean  one- word
 
""
you know it  ' s not an easy job
""
it  ' s smelly 
$z laughed 
""
but it  ' s it  ' s okay
""
i got used to it already
 
""
how many times did you do it 
""
""
i don't remember
""
i started doing it since ninety-two  so i guess one or two
years
""
ever since then i  ' ve been doing it  once every one or two
months or three months 
""
this year i  ' ve been very lazy because i  ' ve been traveling a lot
so  only about maybe two one every two months
 
""
and when was the last time you did it 
""
""
i think probably  a couple of  weeks ago
 
""
you did 
""
""
yes
 
""
where did you go 
""
""
we went beside the camp
""
we took them out from the camp and went beside the beach
""
we we we took them out from the camp and  went to the beach
beside the camp 
""
very close and the water is very shallow so we don't have to worry
about kids getting drowned or you know
""
it was great that they they went out uhm in the water and then the
the adults were just playing among themselves talking chatting and 
barbecuing  two words 
""
the kids were not really aiming for the food they were aiming at
the water you know
""
we all have our 
""
we all have our needs met  yeah
