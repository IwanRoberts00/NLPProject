<I>
uh my name is dary lee
i am the cad systems manager of future solutions
welcome to this seminars 
first of all i would like to take some time to introduce our company
future solution laboratory limited is a software developer and 
system integrator based in hong kong
we are specialized in the architectural and engineering and
construction industry and also the gis industry
we carry a lot of products such as the tracer which will be
introduced today uh and other package such as optimus for 
machine management uhm
and also the autodesk uh fringe components
our major client in hong kong include the uh government bodies such
as the housing authority and also the public utilities uh such as the china
light and power and the hong kong electric company 
today we are going to present a new technology called autocad
system from igs
the software that we want to introduce today is called tracer from
autocad 
tracer has been in the market for two years time
it ' s quite new in hong kong just for one year
despite its short history tracer technology has been installed in
over forty countries world-wide 
so why do we begin tracer
because the history of cad is just about five to ten years uh in
this world
uhm before that we draw uhm we draw all the things on papers
so a lot of paper drawings is produced previously 
the existing paper drawings needs a lot of needs means a lot of
large investment 
so we get to think of how to utilize our previous in 
investment 
so the best way to utilize it is to con to convert all the
existing drawings into the digital format or the cad format
there ' re two methods to achieve this
the first one is to use the digitizers to digitize all the existing
drawing memory into the computer
and the second approach is to copy all the drawings to that is to
be drawn all drawings in the cad environment
both methods are very tedious and time consuming 
but now there ' s another alternative
with the help of tracer and recognizer from autocad you can easily
convert the raster drawings to one word 
drawings uh very uh easily
 one-word in time break induction and
conversion times uhm called saving 
under the ibs umbrella there are many alternatives for document
conversion
user can choose to have uh one-word digitizing
raster overlay raster everything or to do the what we call the 
meta-transition process using two functions
the first one is called the semi-automatic interactive line
tracing 
and second one is called the automatic text and graphic definitions
tracer is the only software available in this market
and it works on one-words autocad 
environment to provide the above functions 
beside from working all the paper document complete into
cad format we have another alternative which is called incremental conversion
this is to integrate the raster and res rester 
image into one single s system
what we call is the hypercad environment 
so we can have eliminated that because we convert drawing on a
as-is basis
so what is a hypercad system
uhm as you are familiar with autocad you use it to draw the line
circle text or dimension into the computer
those lines circles texts are called the four words
beside the four words there ' s ano 
another thing called raster
what ' s a raster
raster is those image that is scanned in from the scanner
those images are form of tiny dot uh which we use the term called
dpi to describe it say two hundred or three hundred or four hundred dpi
the dpi is called called the dots per inch 
traditional autocad environment cannot handle those uhm raster
image
it can only allow users to draw erectus 
but with the help of tracer user is allowed to overlay the
raster image in the autocad environment so that it can perform something
called the pilot editing
we will describe it uh later 
so what tracer provide to user is it it provides user with 
rasoframe capabi capabi capabilities 
and also a complete set of raster editing tools and also the
precision tool kit for ac and practical film 
uhm besides uh the editing function tracer also provide the uh some
other call the scanning post- one-word function such as
 one-word 
 one-word is the transformation of the geometry
of the scanned image into another form because uh what we talking about
scanning image we are refer to very old drawings all tho all the old
drawings uh may be still or distorted when scan in
so we need some tools uh to correct those stilling and distortion
those are a group those uhm methods is called worksheeting 
another thing is uh re regarding the uh one-word
 process is called the noise removal
noise removal is to because uh most of the old drawings are 
very dirty 
there may be spark on the drawings
the noise removal is to remove all those unnecessary spark 
we will demonstrate it later
also the tracer support eleven different raster formats so you can
communicate with other uh raster systems as well 
another superior function for tracer is the semi automatic line
following
it ' s the only way to provide one-word and
head frame one-word to convert the raster image
to one-word 
there is furthermore there ' s another module it ' s called the
recognizer for autocad
it ' s another module
it can automatically convert the graphic and text uhm image into
autocad as string arch circle and also one-word 
lines 
so why tracer is so important
because in this world there are one point eight billion paper
documents
only twenty percent of uh these documents are in visual format or
in cad format
so tracer is the only tool for you to re-utilized those paper
documents 
from this chart you can see that the productivity gains when using
tracer
for normal handy drafting uh uhm it takes about say uh ten times to
finish the drawing
but with the help of uhm tracer it can increase it five to to ten
times 
tracer can apply in these areas 
the first one is the architectural of the city management
uh the second is the mapping of gis area
the third one is the civil engineering field
and the fourth one is the electrical and the practical area as well
as the piping process and also uh the document management process 
in the architectural area we can one-word the
existing floor plan or the design or for one-word 
management purpose
also you can use it to update s as field plan
this is so what called incremental conversion 
for the civil engineer uh area you can use the tracer to trace the
contour lines to create the dtn model
the dtn is the three d digital terrain modeling models 
so that you can use the the result dtn model for one-word
 or or uh go about design 
for piping and processing you can use tracer to trace all the
piping facilities or piping network into autocad format
you can use this uh s what we call the schematic file 
grains later for network analysis 
for mapping conversion you know for gis system the the most tedious
thing is to do the data conversion that is to convert existing maps into uh
digital format
and tracer is the perfect partner to perform this because most
of the uh conversion three words using tracer for this
process instead of using the di the manual digitizer 
okay the trip the history the history of tracer 
#> tracer was announced uh in the nineteen ninety three
the first version is called the cad one-word 
tracer
and then it develop uh other uhm versions we are called the
recognizer the tracer the recognizer release one point one and also the
tracer for window and also two words tracer to
support the color and two words uh raster image
uhm and that ' s all for the presentations
we ' ll go through the uh demonstration
uh
uh future solution is the sole distributor of tracer in hong kong
as well as in china
if you are interested in these products you can contact us later
so let ' s demonstrate the function of tracer 
what we ' ll see is the one-word environment
what we are going to do is to load the raster image into this
environment 
the process is very simple
it ' s just like uh loading uh uh ordinary autocad drawings
on the excuse me on the upper right corner uh this ' s the
tracer menu
the tracer mainly occupy uh one menu in the autocad
environment
the tracer provide you functions to do the uh i/os to do the
editing and also to do the tracing or do the conversion 
ok
let ' s see the raster image
on the screen it ' s a a three size uh maps in hong kong area
tracer provide you i think you cannot see it very clearly so
we change the color to to brighter one
tracer provides you functions to handle those raster image on the
screen such as to hang in around or to zoom in zoom in in zoomer rate
 
also this map is in the resolution of this map is uh three hundred
dots per inch
it it occupies six megabytes of memory
what we are going to do now is to use a process called uhm noise
removal
you see there ' s sometimes dots uh in the screen
those dots uh we call it noise
tracer provides you a function to remove all these noise 
so we select uh rectangle area for noise and then 
you see
the noise is removed 
so after the noise removal we can go into more details
 rig right now we want to pro we we want to
demonstrate some raster editing function
as on the screen there is two building blocks the block thirty
four and the block thirty five
what we are going to do is to demolish these two blocks and then
replace it it with the block uh red here
so we use the functions called raster e erase to erase
those blocks
there are many approaches to erase the block
first one you can use the polygon area to define the area of
interest
and then it wi it will erase the area inside the polygon
uhm just click on the raster object
or you can use a rubber as you as you see in on the screen you can
control the size of the rubber to rub it out 
or use another method is to click on the raster object and it will
be erased completely 
after erasing the next step we are going to do is to copy this
block this block to this area
there ' s many approach to do it but we choose
first of all we convert this raster red block into 
bracket and then copy the brac bracket image from here
to here
mark that mark we going to be tracing because it ' s
we just click on the objects and on the on screen you can see the
red lines 
so when the tracer comes across an intersection point it will ask
the user which way to go something like that
you can choose the direction and then after you define the
direction you can continue the tracer 
so after that you we will convert into a autocad drawing lines
so we can move the two words now 
so configure image 
also you can copy besides copying the beside tracing the raster
image into one-word we can copy the raster image
directly 
we can define the polygons to include the raster image and
then move the raster image within that polygon 
and the operation is very simple 
right now we are going to move another raster image
beside direct copying we can also rotate the raster image or scan
it up or down
but first we want to move this drawing to another new area
this time we we rotate ninety degree and also scan it or use it
and also scan it up two times
as you see this is the new raster image 
beside tracing straight line you can also use it to trace uhm 
curve line 
you just get on the line we are going to trace and then the
tracing will start automatically
as we see on the screen it ' s very fast and accurate 
okay
and finished
it just takes less than one second to trace a curve line 
okay
the green line is the polyline traced from the raster
image 
the beauty of tracer is to allow users to config the behavior of
tracer because uhm for each type of straigh of uh tracing there ' s
uh some parameters to define the pe the behavior
the first stroke is to define the target traced image
that is the route of the traced line and also the gap and the step
and the second is the flow it is the flow of tracing
that is you can define it to stop at intersection or you can uh
use the default value to straight through any intersection or turn right or
turn left 
the third one is the uh adjustment of the outcome line
you can control the one-word factors of the
outcome
such as for a very straight line you can use a line rate for
straightening factor or for the curve line you can use a smaller rate
then more control import will be produced 
also you can control the attributes of the uh outcoming lines
that is the color the layers also the line time 
all those parameters can be saved 
beside interactive line tracing there is a process called
recognition
so we define the areas to do the recognition 
also for recognition we can define different parameters set 
so we can we define the rectangle area and start the recognition
process 
and the process is pretty fast when compared to other software
package in the market
