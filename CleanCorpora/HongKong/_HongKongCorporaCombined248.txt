may i please you my lord uh my lordship you have before you uhm my uhm written submission and my lord should have a uhm plaintiff ' s uh bundle of of authorities uh on on your right hand side my lord uhm my lord if i could just quickly uhm sort of break into that ' s page one of my submission and if i could skip the first paragraph introductory paragraph my lord uhm paragraph two the fourth line although the first defendant was prepared to sell the premises he pleaded his pleaded case being and indeed conformed at the first day of the hearing that he was not liable under the provisional sale and purchase agreement and the third defendant has failed to carry out the certificate instructions in getting the consent of the second defendant being uh before signing  my lord and i ' m now on page two my lord uh a very quick summary as to matters which are not in dispute my lord uhm the first and second defendants being tenants in common uh the first defendant had engaged the third defendant as an agent to check the market price and had handled potential purchasers of the uh uh of of the property including uh taking clients to view the property and the first defendant uh did indeed give the key to the third defendant on the twentieth eighth of august uh the third defendant signed on behalf of the first defendant as well as the second defendant with uh with the plaintiff a a provisional agreement my my lord these are not in dispute it ' s stipulated in the agreement that the third defendant signed on behalf of both both d one and d two on the twentieth eighth as prior to the signing uh d three had made telephone contact with both d one and d two  m my lord the matters that are in dispute whether the first second defendant consented to engaging the third defendant and it ' s merely for the limited propose of checking the market price and had not empowered the third defendant to act as an agent for for the sale whether the second defendant had agreed to sell the property and uh whether the third defendant had failed to obtain consent form the second defendant to sell on the on the twentieth eighth of au august d three confirmed uh with third defendant that her intention to sell at one point nine three eight million and also authorized d three to sign on her behalf my lord uhm the third defendant appointed to sell and signed on behalf of both uh first and the second defendant my lord it is the second defendant ' s case that he never authorized the third defendant to sell on his behalf there has never been any direct authorization from uh d two to d three second defendant only authorize the first defendant just to check the market price at the said premises d two further gave uh evidence that since he moved into the premises in uh late june ninety one he had no no intention to sell at all for any price he was happy uh living there and had spent a lot of money on decorations my lord in respect of the defendant ' s intention to sell my lord i respectfully submit it is more probable that the first and second defendant when originally purchased uh the happy valley premises intended uh that it ought it was to be resold uh uhm but decided to move in when they could not sell my lord i say this uhm because uh there there threre ' s of the uh inference from the five months du duration between the d  delivery of the property and the time they actually moved in uh d one and d two being interested in hong kong property market would have the just the prospect of selling the happy valley flat d one had raised the topic in numerous occasions it is incredible that the second defendant would not have discussed the prospect of sale with the first defendant or if he was not keen to sell at all it was incredible that d two would not have informed d d one of his intention uh this is especially so when d one and d two had known each other for twenty years uh it ' s incredible when realizing d one was keen to sell but d two would have let him waste his time and effort and give him false hope of there being any prospect of sale further d two admits he had a general idea as to how much the market price of the property was to instruct d three was to get the exact market price had he no intention intention to sell whatsoe ever there was no intension for him to instruct d three to check the exact market price uhm d two in his statement states that d three had in some social occasions informed him as to the price of the property uh that indicate my lord uh there was no reason why he would not have terminated his said instruction thereafter as far as he was concerned that d three could offer no further assistance to him uh and d one ' s statement d one evidence stands for appeared uh to support d two case that d two ex extension of authority to d three was only limited to price checking my lord how however one important piece of his evidence in his statement being in about august i together with second defendant specifically authorised the third defendant to sell the premises on our behalf at the price of one point nine seven million  d one had not given any reasonable explanation as stated in the statement and it ' s incredible that uh uh had d two only consented to price checking uh the witness statement should have been complied in an un a a a unambiguous form and my lord it should be d one uh would have put this signature to it d one and d two have known each other for twenty years known each other well enough to agree to live under the same roof there had been plenty of opportunities to discuss the matter both were interested in proper mar property market so naturally it is incredible that d one who was so keen to sell would not have been enquired from d two whether d two was willing to sell and what price d two would have been willing to sell at as he knew well he could not have sold without d two consent my lord it is also incredible that d one would not have informed d two when passing on keys to d three and my my lord uh the agent uh could not forewarning d two to put away valuables and beware of possible inconvenience caused it is improbable that d one could have come to a figure one point nine seven million when instructing d three to sell d one must have had some ideas to what region if not the exact figure would have been acceptable to d two my lord it is incredible that the first defendant would have engaged the third defendant and agreed to uh award her one per cent in the event of a successful sale sale without the discussing it with d two this is especially so when d two was to bear half the commission something that d two had consented to instruct d three with a view to sell my lord we note that uh the vendor kept paying agency fee is is rather unusual in in the uh in the hong kong property market uhm my lord had had there been such an arrangement one would have thought that that it ought to be made clear to a any co-owners my lord uh d three when signing when sign my my lord i ' m into the territory of why would d three uh signed without the authority paragraph fifteen d three when signed the agreement would have known full well that the consequence of signing without d two ' s authority  she was only that to get the commission of nineteen uh thousand and four hundred dollars it was not a matter of extreme urgency there was no pressure from the plaintiff uh for the for the third defendant to give her an answer on uh twentieth eighth uh of august d two was only a phone call away if it was the case then d d the second defendant had not responded in the first contact d three could have tried two words to contact d two that d two had not responded there ' s no apparent reason why d three when subsequently phoning d one would not have informed him that she could not get an answer from her d two in short my lord there is no apparent reason why d three would entered into the contact without the authority of d two especially when she had taken the trouble to seek my lord hereto the view on that day and uh d one had specifically told her to obtain d two ' s consent my lord i respectfully submit that d two version is less probable in that he was made aware from d one that on the twentieth that someone wanted to buy his flat he made no enquiry as to a offered price despite his intention to sell come what may uh my lord despite there ' s no intention to sell come what may uh he made uh note that rejection uh uh what contradict contrary to the previous attitude being checking the price was merely a business between d one and d three he was not to get involved in any sale but my lord on the twentieth eighth of august did he not even attempt to stop d two from asking d three to call him back my lord uh one would have thought that if he want to uh want to uh avoid getting into the picture he he could simply tell uh d d one to forget it there ' s no need to ask d three to contact any any further my lord further it is not likely d two uh had had many properties and that this was only one of them uh d two was dealing with the property that he was residing in and evidence being that that was the only property under his name at that time d two was aware of d d one intention to sell as d one had mentioned to him almost every few days uh since they moved in yet accepted that there could have been a prospect form d one only selling his share it is improbable that d two could have maintained his won't careless attitude and this is especially so when he take his order of viewing other properties but not even bother to make the return uh call to either d one or d three when you uh knew well there was a firm offered on the twentieth eight submitted it is incredible that d two could have been entirely uninterested in the progress not even interested in the asking price even if his mobile ran out of batteries he could phone uh d two d three at a regular phone before he went to radio hong kong after the meeting in radio hong kong i submit on uh balance the reason why why there were no further attempt for d two to contact d three or vice versa uh being there was expressed consent from d two uh for for d three to sign on sign on his behalf uh and the rest was left uh to be worked out with the uh the first defendant and the plaintiff my lord uh in respect of the sale of the flat with meagre furniture uh d two stated that d one was to move out of the property uh it would be interesting to note that who who had the ownership of the property and furnishing my lord notes that he had fifty percent of some two words  uh specific instruction would have been required in order to be in position to confirm the items uh that were to to go the exact uh my lord would note that the uh uh uh list of furnishing was an extensive list and it is improbable that d one alone wou would be in the position to confirm the sale of the uh furnishing without the prior of approval or consent of d two submit d one must have at some stage prior to his giving consent uhm discussing matter with d two my lord uh the significance of the uh date of completion being two months away in that uh d d three states that it was upon his instructions of d two that the date of completion was to be two months away d one confirmed that d three had informed him on twentieth eight uh of august there is no suggestion that her proposal had come from anyone other than d two d one was was anxious to sell uh the plaintiff had no problems in making down- payment and and  uh uh d three had no interest in setting the completion date three months away the two months completion date would make sense if d two ' s intention was to sell the happy valley flat in order to buy another flat so that it would have sufficient time to arrange for more my lord uh in any event my lord uh quite rightly observe that there there ' s no reason why there ' s there was a a concoction on the d three uh part uh to invent the the the two months uh two months completion time my lord uhm uh in respect of the uh issue on there being there ' re there ' re a re return of the deposit it is the d one and d two ' s contention there are fifteenth of uh september meeting the plaintiff accepted the return of his property of forty thousand dollars she has at that time purchased a flat in discovery bay the plaintiff states uh the only reason she mentioned discovery bay was when she left the meeting she refused to take blank cheque
