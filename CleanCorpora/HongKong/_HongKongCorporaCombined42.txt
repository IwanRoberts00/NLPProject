  i i want to know how how you people uh you ' re people of hong kong and how you feel about hong kong how how do you like hong kong  oh wow wow all-laugh  it is really a very difficult to answer     because it ' s in my in my home places i i know many of my colleagues are thinking of migrating  migrating away to places like australia  uh yeah  so how how how do you like hong kong   uh ha   uh ha   uh ha   uh ha uh ha  actually we like uh actually we like the environment of hong kong uh it is very convenient to live in hong kong for example of the good transport the uh although the housing is uh you know the private housing is very expensive  but for those uh for you know uh for those house are built by the government uh it is not  $b-coughs very expensive and it is near the working place when compare with uh for example western countries and some other places tut and the uh you knows the uh living standard in hong kong when compare with those uh western cities or even uh japan or others uh uh tut advanced city it is not very uh expensive actually in living in hong kong is a very convenience place uh however as you as long as you heard uh recently you heard that uh many people uh want to uh for example they want to migrant to australia want to migrant to canada and other western countries they i think the most reason is that they are under the influence of the uhm tut coming of the nineteen ninety-seven    yeah right  uhm uhm  uhm so personally i think hong kong is suitable for young people to live  because espec  yeah especially young people  those energetic ones  because i ' ve travelled to europe and i i like uh that environment very much very natural and very quiet but hong kong is too crowded    why young people   oh   oh   oh  yes hong kong is too crowded   but but yeah yeah yeah but it ' s uh it ' s very boring for people to live especially young people to live uh in europe because no entertainments and  $b's-mobile-phone-rings sorry all-laugh  but it ' s too crowded for me i like uh the environments of europe i like hong kong because hong kong is not boring oh it ' s   so  so as i said it ' s for young people   but but what what is so interesting for hong kong is it hong kong is not boring but what do you find that interesting in hong kong  yeah   uh ha uh ha  because i have friends i have i have friends i have my family in hong kong   oh so so to you it ' s it ' s the born it ' s a born   yeah yeah in born yeah   but if you look at it for another point of view about the place  would would would you say that it ' s interesting   uh yes  you you mean the condition right the living condition oh yeah     several words the environment  yes not not not not not so much your family and friends in uh   uh ha   uh ha uh ha  living condition yeah uhm  i think the living condition first of all i i mention before i uh mainly concern about the convenience of uh go out to uh elsewhere place go out to another place and then if you ' re really talking about the environment for example uhm when you compare uh when you in a view of uh uh geography or something other else you say uh talk about the environment for example the air the air quality or the uhm noise quality in hong kong   uh air pollution  i i mean pollution yes pollution in hong kong yeah uh if you are were talking about something like pollution in hong kong uh of course uh living in other uh western countries uh for example usa or other uhm usa or australia or uh new zealand uh of course they have uh a lot of uh green uh green lands there  and they have woods uh a a lot of uh woods and uh jungles there and uhm their uh surrounding environment and the scenery is much beautiful and uh that is much beautifuller than hong kong    yeah  so what do you think as compare to singapore   i ' m i i think hong kong hong kong uhm in in many way is similar to singapore  esp especially hong kong island is is a very tut it it ' s a city is it  just as singapore is a city  so when when i travel around at at hong kong island  everywhere looks about the same  there it all shopping centre and shopping centre and and nothing else but shopping centre you see so so to to me it like hong kong island is is is boring in this sense that is it ' s only shopping and cinema you know yeah  to to me it ' s it ' s boring   uh ha   yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uhm   uh ha   uh ha   uh   uh ha   oh i say uhm   how how about entertainment   yeah entertainment   do you think there are many variety of entertainment in hong kong   uhm okay what what let me see  karaoke yeah one-word yes  mov movies right uh what else do you have  bars you have discos   karaoke yeah   uh   uh  bars discos nightclub or     nightclubs  yeah cinemas ice-skiing  uhm     yeah   anything you think of  yeah  shopping mall yeah shopping mall   uhm uhm  or uh have you consider about the situa   one-word uh uh uh location i ' m sorry uh  it ' s about the location of uh for example uhm the uh schools in hong kong you know when you walk travel around and walking around walking along the hong kong island you will see that oh why is there is so many uh uh so many private uh pri  uh primary school they just situated uh next to the uh for example next to the uh uhm shopping mall uh next to the uh uh housing residence have you think about this problem oh this is not a problem but have you ever think about uh is it a characteristic or is it uh quite different from   singapore   it ' s okay     uh   yes  i i think it ' s quite strange   strange     yeah   yeah   uhm uhm  in what sense strange   i because uhm most of us in fact all the schools in singapore they they they have their own compound  oh yeah yeah    yeah  so they have each each school they have their tut  within their basketball court  and something like that and and it ' s enclosed  it ' s an enclosed area   oh uh ha uh ha uh ha   uh ha   uh   uhm    yeah you you you don't find  do you have better uh   that ' s why i think it ' s better uhm that that that you have to compare the facilities  yeah facilities in the schools i mean do they have sufficient uh recreational   facilities for the children in the school  things like that yeah   three words   oh   oh yeah yeah yeah uhm   uh ha ha ha ha   uh ha  uhm uhm     but but most of it a sidetrack uh we are talking about whether hong kong is interesting or not and now we ' re talking about school all-laugh  never mind   uhm uhm  oh how about uh the uh for example the commercial area is it the same as singapore i mean you know a lot of uh tall buildings establish   okay the the commercial area is is different in a few aspect okay first of all is the light in in hong kong when you walk along the street you you see the the several words  does it alright  in in singapore you don't you don't see such things   yeah the light box uhm  why ' s that   why why why is that so   yeah yeah yeah   i i suppose uhm they they the why why is the concern on electricity  the second the second thing is uh is so that the the city looks more more orderly  $z-laughs  not not so  not so messy  but but i i found that uh this this kind of uhm lights and signs they they are quite useful when when especially when you are looking for   uh ha uh ha   oh oh yeah   uh   uh  yeah yeah yeah   for something yeah and and the other thing is that in in singapore the residential area are are situated in different places from the commercial area  so so in in the in the older part in the yeah in the older part of singapore  $b-laughs  we have such thing called shop houses that is the first storey are the shop and then maybe the second and the third  storey yeah there ' s residen  yeah flat  and hong kong people to live in uhm that ' s that ' s the old the older part right now there uhm there there there no more uh there are very few of such shop houses now we we have flat you know shops are shops houses are houses you know some something like that  yeah  so so uhm   oh   yeah   uhm uhm uhm   residen  residential   uh ha   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   so it looks very neat right and clean and  that ' s the point of your government  right     uh   oh  in in in the way uh i mean look at it look at causeway bay  caus causeway bay to me is like uh a place to shop is it  so i i i i can't imagine myself living in such a noisy  yeah yeah  oh oh  in hong kong a a lot of places like that especially uh you know you know the term cbd  uh the other  uh around the china zone of cbd for example causeway bay even uh sheung wan or if in the kow if in the kowloon side it ' s uh near tsim sha tsui or mongkok uh the situation is all in a situation is more or less the same uh downstairs first second or third floor it is very crowded with a lot of uh shopping uh shopping uh shopping areas uh a lot of shops establish and upstairs is residential area  there is one thing quite interesting about hong kong uh i ' m not sure whether in singapore there is uh such kind of situation happen uh for example uh you know there is uh there is a big there is a big uh road between one side is the factory establish and one side is the residential area and that is happen in uh for example uh in the old industrial area for example in kwun tong uh have you ever been to kwun tong before    uh   oh yeah uh   uh ha  no  no uh the situation is that at one side there is a lot of factories establish you you know you ' re looking at the chimney and they had a lot of uh discharge coming out  and other side uh     yeah uhm   yeah   and such things in singapore uh but but are the industries uhm the heavy heavy industry or the light industry  it there is a difference you know because there is some light industry like embroidery you know embroidery or sewing you know it ' s uh it ' s it ' s okay because there is not there there isn't so much pollution  yeah we we have such thing you know but but the but the heavy industry there like like those uh that involve metal work  uh they are they are concentrated  together   and separated from the residential areas  but for the lighter uh indus  industry like what i say embroidery  yeah they are they can't be located within the the residential estate   uhm uhm   yeah   uh   uh ha uh ha   uh ha   uhm   uhm   oh   oh oh    yeah  oh how uhm uhm you first you first   but   but i prefer living in the area surrounding the shopping centre > because i think it is very convenient     yeah  may may maybe yeah yeah you used to it  yeah you really used to it   yeah uhm  uhm uhm uh there is a di  there is a a one point i want to uh follow up is that uh as you mention in singapore there is uh the places for the heavy industry as well as the places for the uhm light industry but in hong kong the situation is quite different uh for example for uh heavy industry for example those uh uh uh uh  those for uh ship building uh such kind of industry uh we have wear  but uh for the manufacturing of uh for example garments uhm tut high tech products uh we have such kind of industry and the government is uh doing a lot of uh planning about the uh location of the uh different kind of industry you know in ta uh in tai po uh that is in uh new territories  in tai po uhm there there ' s a lot of uh industrial area establish and that kind of industrial area is mainly for those high tech  indus uh industrial work for example making the uh the uh circuit board of computer uh they have such kind of industry however uh at the same place uh at at the same place no no not at the same place but uh in the in other area it is also uh a uh that area is uh yes tuen mun for tuen mun yes uh for ex uh therefore that area it is the uh re-establish of those uh old industry in hong kong for example uh uh there is some uh uh the land use in uh for example the land use in old urban areas for example one place is kwun tong uh government want to move uh some of the uh uh industry to go to tuen mun for example uh uh you know the vitasoy uh about vitasoy    uh uh  uhm vitasoy  vitasoy you know   vitasoy  vitasoy yeah there ' s a drinking  yeah there ' s a  there ' s a big dr uh uh uh big company  manufacturing a lot of drinks  uh the government want to move such kind of company for example manufacturer of drinks manufacturer of  those for example coca cola before     oh yeah yeah oh oh   uh   yeah yeah   uhm   oh so food food industry   those those  yes food industry before it is uh  si uh it before it is located in kwun tong you know in kwun tong it uh the situation is like that at one uh  at one side it is uh uh for example the food industry area and the next just next next is uh no no no not opposite but just beside beside that  beside that uh uh just beside that food uh manufacturing company there is a company making for example the uh  the apparatus the uh for cars all-laugh for vehicles and the government think     uhm   uhm   next just next   beside   uh   uhm   and it doesn't look so hygienic you know  yeah yeah so the government uh encourage the uh for example food manufacturing comp uh uh factories to go to tuen mun and they uh want to uh centralize them in tuen mun separate from uh in hong uh in kwun tong    yeah yeah  yeah  i think all this kind of city planning it it it takes time   uhm  yeah   it takes time yeah  uhm uhm is there any city planning for example the uh uh for example some renovation in the old urban area     yeah  yeah yeah we have this uh ur urban development board    uh yeah this this this is is responsible for city planning and and and also for the the preservation of the historic site  yeah you know  some some of the building that have historical value    although they are very old and like they look like they look like they look like to torn many times so so it is their responsibility to preserve this kind of  building  yeah   yup   uh ha uh ha   uh ha   uh   for the for the tourist industry or for us   some other     for not not  not only for the tourist indu industry but also for tut the sake of our history  oh    yeah   oh   i see     yeah  uh ha yeah uh uhm uhm and then uh i think i think there is a uh interesting point i want to ask you when the first day you come to uh you know you landed in the kai tak airport in the hong kong international airport what do you think have you uh look out have you look out and see why there is a lot of roof there  $z-laughs   have you ever think about such kind of  question  what what is the first impressions    uh   uhm  yeah when you see of hong kong     what are two-words  what ' s my first impression  they   or do you have any expectation before   yes i had  i did had expectation  yeah so you know something like that i expected so so i i wasn't really so so   surprise or so surprise yeah   yeah   what what   oh yeah   surprise  uhm uhm uh have you had get the experience for example uh in uh kowloon city and you just uh stand in the street and you watch oh there is an aeroplane over there all-laugh  over my head i can see the wheels there     yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i i can just   in singapore is this the same thing happen   no no no no no because uh our our airport is uh  is very far away from the city  yes i know i ' ve been there    yes yes   one-word  oh it ' s it ' s not exactly far but  it ' s not exactly far from the city i mean if you take a take a cab from the airport to the to hotel it take only twenty one-word  no just you take twenty one-word but but if it ' s located at the extreme end of of the island yeah   uh uh uh i see  uhm    yeah is  so there there are no residential area around the airport  i can discover    uhm  not not not near the airport  yeah  not not near the airport yeah   yeah   so  uhm so many plants and trees around the airport  an idol lands    uh  uh there there there are there are are the buildings but but those are offices  not not residential areas  yeah yes   yup   oh i see   oh ha ha ha   hong kong is quite different when you live in kowloon city all-laugh  and yeah well uh previously uh one of my uh i mean in secondary school one of my classmate uh living in kowloon city before he said that uh well he uh eve every for example every two to uh two minutes they have flat uh woo  $a-makes-aeroplane-sound  $z-laughs  there ' s the flying of the aeroplane upstairs  and they one-word     uh uh ha   is it very distributing is it is it very distributing for them   no they get used to it  they are get uh accustomed to such kind of environment  and they do not think it is a matter be but uh when they uh first first of all when they move to there they feel very uh you know irritating  but uh after uhm a few after a few weeks they feel they say that that ' s okay    uh   yeah yeah   irritating   yeah  uh   uhm   uhm   uhm  but the most affected is abo uh is the schools nearby under the uh you know under the airway under the uh un under the airline the uhm most uh there is quite a quite a quite a number of school are are there i mean the primary school uh even the secondary school is al are also located there and the most distributing is uh that uh that school  uhm uh  but but they have installation of special facility to minimize the noise right yeah they have installed uh air conditioning and uh for example uh you know uh it there is uh you know uh usually we have uh uh only uh uh one layer of windows  but they have double layer of  windows it reduces a lot of sound  some kind of several words   yeah   double layer yeah
