the government makes public one of hong kong ' s best kept
secrets
the pope undergoes surgery in a rome hospital
and chinese dissidents appeared at the democratic national
convention
good evening
thanks for joining us
the government has departed from tradition to disclose how much hong
kong has in its exchange fund
and from now on the balance sheet of the fund will be published
every year
making public one of hong kong ' s best kept secrets is seen as a
move to impress prospective lenders especially for the new airport
hong kong ' s exchange fund until now one of the best kept financial
secrets in town is used to safeguard the territory ' s exchange rates
stability
at the end of nineteen ninety-one it stands at two hundred and
thirty-six billion hong kong dollars
the bulk of which are foreign currency assets worth twenty-nine
billion us dollars equivalent to about two hundred and twenty-five billion
hong kong dollars speech by hamish macleod financial secretary of hk 
it gives hong kong a per capita foreign currency holding of
five thousand us dollars
the exchange fund has accumulated earnings of almost ninety-nine
billion hong kong dollars
this fund is separated from hong kong ' s fiscal reserves of
seventy-six billion hong kong dollars which can be used for public spending
and there ' s also twenty-five billion hong kong dollars excluding
interests in the land fund for the future ' s special administrative region
pledging to publish annual balance sheets of the exchange fund from
now on hamish macleod obviously saw it as a political move conducive to
attracting lenders for projects such as the new airport speech by hamish
macleod 
it also reflects the new open government policy statement
by hamish macleod 
the fund has been kept a secret before for good reason says
macleod
but circumstances have changed
hong kong ' s monetary framework has strengthened significantly in
recent years so that the territory is less vulnerable to speculative
pressures on the exchange rate
disclosure of foreign currency reserves is also established
practice in other major market economies
the new governor chris patten also hailed the move as a show of
hong kong ' s financial strength
not least to neighbours to the north speech by chris patten
the senior official of the new china news agency cheung
chung seng refused to comment
hong kong legislators and bankers have also welcomed the disclosure
of the territory ' s exchange fund
they also say it will serve to strengthen hong kong ' s financial
future speech by martin barrow 
the figures should be known to the chinese side long time ago
and uh the government announcing the figures at this time would
serve the purpose of showing to those potential uh financiers who are uh
willing to finance hong kong ' s project
and also it s shows that the hong kong government is quite
confident of china ' s and hong kong ' s political future
a a a good move to tell uh the world basically including the
international financial community that uh we do have a lot of uh reserves and
uh we do have the financial resources to uh meet the uh the need for airport
construction
 
given the strong fundamentals of hong kong economy the hong kong
dollar is not going to come under any pressure
uh furthermore was the exchange fund increasing its
control on hong kong interest rates
uhm the exchange fund has uh very useful interest rates tool to to
work with in case the hong kong dollar comes under pressure 
the governor says the new airport will be vital to hong kong ' s
economy
this comes as chris patten took his first tour at chek lap
kok this afternoon
the first stop for chris patten was kai tak to see how things are
run there
in the afternoon patten was flown to chek lap kok where he took the
driver seat of a tractor and was briefed on the progress of the port and
airport projects something he called important to the territory ' s future

while at chek lap kok the head of the provisional airport
authority called on britain and china to get on with the project which is
stalled over financial arrangements statement made by richard allen of
the provisional airport authority 
this afternoon the new china news agency deputy director said
it ' s not china ' s fault there is a deadlock over financing
 cheung chung seng says the airport should be built as soon
as possible without any burden to the future sar
the airport talks resume tomorrow in hong kong
a study group on the airport ' s infrastructure has called for the
cancellation of the rail link project
the group ' s convenor said a detailed study of government
information shows that the project would leave hong kong with an overwhelming
debt of one hundred twenty four billion dollars by the year twenty ten 
 
now if we are going to build this airport railways then we will
left with no money to improve our existing systems to modify our
existing systems and to build these new lines to solve the congestion
problems in the eastern part of kowloon city uh kowlo kowloon
peninsula i ' m sorry as well as the nathan road congestion systems

thirty instances in each of the past two months compared with the peak of

peri chow reports
it appeared that the police were prepared for the noisy
protesters
but the turnout was a staggering sixteen hundred
barricades were set up and only twenty representatives of each of
the ten groups demonstrating were allowed to come close to the legco building
the police managed to keep everything in order except for verbal
 pressures between the rival groups which don't see eye to eye on the
proposed multi-seat single vote system
supporters of the system say a voter should be allowed to cast one
ballot regardless of the number of seats in his constituency
they say that will prevent a weaker candidate from winning by
rallying with the stronger candidate
however those on the other side of the fence say the proposed
system will frustrate a voter ' s choice
they call for referendum on the issue to find out whether a one
vote for one seat is in the best interest of democracy
