<I>
so actually i did what i expected
this is uhm i hope i hope to say something of uh
 one-word uh these topic the topics 
among friends
 it ' s all good friends and we have no need for
introduction and no need for courtesy
actually this multiple words but but i i uh
 i really want to write a much much much longer essay on this and i think
that what i am going to say is only perhaps only one fifth of what i
uh intended to write uh but it ' s already uh uh quite a long essays
so i think the uhm one words then is uh
will be too sketchy and some slippery
so i think i hope that to multiple words later
and i certainly is a kind of draft for this uh for today
okay let ' s start to write to to read it
so the topic is the humanities and humanistic education
uhm uhm in a kind of introduction i would like to talk
about humanities and humanistic education today not because i have i have any
particular insight into this topic
on the contrary i ' ve too many questions on the meaning of these
two terms
i want to ask myself whether i understand the very subjects that i
have learnt and taught in the past twenty years
i began my university education first in architecture and later in
philosophy which took me almost twelve years to complete
thereafter i have been teaching philosophy and humanity subjects
and later took part in the es in the establishment of ba in 
humanities at the baptist college
in other words i have directly engaged in the humanities in
humanistic education for many years
yet i am not sure whether i have a clear idea of what the
humanities are and why they are being taught
i don't think that is only my problem
robert e palter in a recent book on the problems of the
humanities begins with the followings quote from palter ' s book
 palter ' s pobem problem is ours too
the original humanities refer to the western humanistic traditions
starting from socrates and aristotle through cicero quintilian and
the renaissance thinkers down to matthew arnold of the late nineteenth
century
this tradition is dead because their ideas and ideals embodied in
the humanities are no longer relevant in the content we wrote 
they are distinct they are disintegrated and forgotten
hence what we cannot define is not the meaning of the humanities in
the traditional sense but their contemporary usage
what apparently remained is only the name of an administrative
division of the u of the university and a cluster of mostly 
connected disciplines under th under the division of the humanities
or the arts
like philosophy appears in the in the degree of phd
it is just a name without any meaningful content
i would like to discuss this issue in the context of hong kong and
to see whether the humanities are dead
i would suggest that our situation here is more complicated than
that of palter ' s since we are not just facing the western but also
the chinese tradition of the humanities 
i would outline the difficulties in fig in define the
humanities in both traditions and the implication to the humanistic edition
uh education
number two 
so what are the humanities
one easy way to answer it is to check the meaning in the dictionary
the concise oxford dictionary reads learning quote learning
or literature con concern with human nature and culture especially
study of latin and greek classics 
it is clearly not very useful because it ' s both too broad and too
narrow
sociology and anthropology are concerned with human culture
yet it is rather difficult to include them under the humanities
if the humanities refer only to the study of latin and greek
classics as some universities in the usa still do then obviously most
commonly regarded as humanity subjects will fall outside this category
the definition given by the national endowment for the humanities
offers a no better option
this is a quote a long quote follows designating a number of
specific subjects as belonging to the field of humanities 
this array of disciplines does not take us very far in the search
for an understanding or the meanings of the humanities
however it gives an indication of the meaning of humanities through
the implication of their opposite the sciences
the humanities are concern with quality and value of human life and
culture employing historical and philosophical approaches while the realm of
the objective and the quantifiable belong to the scientific investigation
the humanities and the sciences are two distinctly separated areas
of discipline
one is subjective and speculative the and the other is objective
and realistic
i think c p snow has pointed out long time ago the danger
of this separation as two opposing cultures 
but the original meaning of humanities if we go back to the
classical root should not have any anti-scientific connotation
 d'estutia humanitatis in the renaissance
includes not only literature the arts the philosophy but also scientific
study of nature
the opposition between humanities and the sciences is only a
contemporary phenomenon
indeed the meaning of one-word humanities 
intuit is rooted deeply in the classical tradition
it grows out of the idea of men and the ideal of education
the term humanities comes from the latin humanitas
the roman one-word uh one-word
 in the second century gave a definitive formulation of the
term
this i quote quote of the formula 
in this passage the end of quote in this passage the meaning of the
humanities is determined by two interconnected ideas which eventually have
proved a proof to be of lasting important in understanding of the humanities
one is the axiological idea of a human being
a person is to be distinguished from all other creatures and in him
alone lies the possibility of actualizing the highest virtue of man that
is the human humanitas 
on the other hand there is a programmatic idea a curriculum the 
boneless artist yielding to this actualization 
hence the humanities are both the ideal of man and curriculum for
the humanistic education
nevertheless it ' s not very clear as to what exactly the ideal
of human being and what this curriculum should consist
the aim of education is to bring out the virtue of man to become
fully humanized
to model on the fully humanized man a person in the castle age i i
suggested is aristotle idea of philosopher and cicero ' s orator 
however philosopher and orator are not necessarily two contrary
ideas
both come f from the idea of padeia the greek
ideals of education
to be a free person as well as to be a good citizen
the difference lies only in the priority of the purpose of right
whether the pursuit of knowledge itself pertains to the goal of a
free man or the fulfillment of civic responsibility is the ultimate criterion
to qualify a good life 
to be free means to be free from ignorance prejudice from 
narrowness and aro arrogance
and at the same time to be free to seek an intellectual and
contemplative life
 full philosophy as the highest possible happiness attained
by a person
for aristotle the desire for knowledge is the basic and deepest
natural urge for the human being
this correlates to a famous definition of one-word
 quotation in another language followed by its translation 
 a living being possessing the potentiality of reasoning and
articulation 
the highest goal that man may achieve is actualization of
this potentiality of reason whe i which is realized in the form
of metaphysical knowledge 
hello 
so the last the last sentence is uh this correlates to a famous
definition of one-word quotation in another language
followed by its translation a living being possessing the
potentiality of of reasoning and articulation 
the highest goal that man may achieve is actualizing of this
potentiality of reason which is realized in the form of metaphysical
knowledge as formulated in this three words ethics that
is happiness
the idea that knowledge itself is intrinsically good and valuable
and the model of a philosopher serve as two important parameters or for
 for assessing the meaning of the humanities up to the modern times 
for cicero and quintilian on the other hand knowledge has no
intrinsic value except as a contribution to the formation of an orator
the status of the orator in the days of cicero is exceptionally
high
he is not just a good and eloquent speaker but the leader of
society
the proper use of language in the public sphere is the
most important political instrument for an orator
this i quote quotation from cicero said cicero in the
 de oratore 
 his is the emphasis an on the practical result of
the humanities
the artist one-word which are the basic
requirement for an orator
the orator as a good citizen political leader possesses not only
theoretical knowledge but also moral virtues
quintilian adds quote quotation from quintilian 
this moral character of the humanities remain as a fundamental
principle for all intellectuals who claim to have a humanistic education
the purpose of education is to serve society
the conception of d'estudia humanitatis in the
renaissance follows that tradition
leonardo bruin a humanistic ora a humanistic scholar in
the fifteenth century conceived the meaning of humanities in the echo of the
classical heritage
in a friend ' s in a letter to a friend asking him to devote more
time in the study of of the humanities he says quotation from leonardo
bruin 
these two are therefore called the humanities because the
perfect and adorned uhm human being homo 
i think this brief survey of the classical conception of the
lesson humanities in is enough for our purpose in the understanding of
the meaning of the humanities that is the idea of being human and the
curriculum leading to the actualization of this ideal 
if you look at the chinese tradition for the meaning of the
humanities we shall find a striking similarity between it and th i 
and the western ideas
both stress on the moral connotation or the purpose of human
learning
on comparable concept of the humanities yan man yan man
 appears first in the i ching
this i quote quotation from the i ching partly spoken in
cantonese 
the human activities mentioned here are not simply any hu 
human activities but a special set of moral activities
the late professor tan jung yee explains
it ' s a quote
this what i i translated
i think the translation is not very good actually
 quotation from professor tan translated by speaker a 
i think this is really with the tradition dominant 
confucian doctrinal education which aims is to one-word 
one ' s small virtue and to thereby extend these small activities to the world
 quotation in chinese 
so i come to the third part
perhaps i have lingered too long in the classical tradition
we have to go back where we started in the beginning
according to palter the original humanities is dead 
and the contemporary humanities have no direction and are in a chaotic
situation 
the obvious reason for the death of the humanities with the of the
humanities tradition is the result of the scientific technological revolution
which started in the seventeenth century and thereafter change the world
radically in all aspects of life notwithstanding the idea and aim of
education
the charm of scientific progress set the criterion of
truth based on the scientific paradigm
reliable knowledge can only be obtained through empirical
scientific methodologies
knowledge is no longer considered primarily a virtue as socrates
the socratic tradition maintains
knowledge beginning with the radical epistemological turn by
francis bacon is power
knowledge is directed outside the one-word 
activity towards the world
the moral character of knowledge we becomes a minor issue
whereas the ex explanatory power of scientific knowledge of the
world is a chief concern
furthermore the application of scientific knowledge to technology
proved to be extremely successful
hence the value of any knowledge is measured by its
practicality and usefulness
the humanities can by no means claim any sense of usefulness
the status as knowledge is problematic
the object of studies of one-word 
humanities is not the objective world of facts but the written texts
the study of philosophy is another set of ideas out of
some philosophers ' mind
it is at best only ideas upon ideas
what ' s the point to know the concept of transcendent in 
rousseau phenomenology or the idea of tragedy by shakespeare
to rephrase marx a little bit there is no indication of when
the paraphrase from marx ends 
so far the humanities have interpreted the world argued about
human nature explained the past
it described human suffering and happiness
but the point is how to change all of them
i don't think the humanities have the answer for that
what the world needs most so we are told are certainly not orators
or philosophers or virtuous men but scientists and techn 
technologies with concrete contribution to knowledge and ability to change
the world according to human needs 
at the same time, the demand for knowledge specialization and the
restructuring of the modern university for further disintegrate the
humanities into separate departments of learning
the organic unity of the artist one-word has
lost its bond
the classical unity of cla of chinese humanities that is
literature history and philosophy that should be man sze chit
 has broken down into three different departments which are most of
the time completely ignorant of each other
our situation in hong kong is even worse
literature is not only separated from history and philosophy but
also from culture
a graduate in english literature learnt a lot about shakespeare
but without a clue on who lee po might be
feels no embarrassment at all
no wonder
it ' s not his fault because his teacher probably does not even
recognize the need to know the chinese literature
perhaps maybe it ' s not a case if it ' s a comparativist 
the grouping of disciplines and to which faculties follows no
definite principles
history
a traditional humanity subject can be put under social sciences
the other disciplines are put together because of administrative
inertia
each every discipline can be an independent at would at as it
would claim
inter-disciplinary studies or research is a superficial and not a
very serious business
so is academic situation one words the death
of traditional humanities
the problem is apparently there is no problem at all
apparently we are all at ease with the present situation as long
as we have found our own haven in the academic world
the question wha what the humanities are and what the
aims of humanistic education is are barely discussed among colleagues
they were not even mentioned during the re 
one-word exercise of the degree ba in humanities
