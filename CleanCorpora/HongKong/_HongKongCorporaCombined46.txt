look at the dog it ' s really scared  i mean like you can put this huge thing in front of him you know i mean it ' s black and he ' s white you think he can see color you think he knows that this is a different color from himself   i don't think he can see color no he should be used to technology  why why should he used to technology   well look around you  yeah but he doesn't know it ' s technology does he    laugh  i mean i mean he ' s really sh  he is really shrinking away from it i mean he ' s ri he ' s ri retreated to the other end of the table keeping a safe distance from this thing   it ' s just bored two-words sleep  three-words   i don't think so  you think so   yep  well i don't know it ' s not really it ' s not really it ' s bedtime yet and this is the time when he becomes very active when he sort of gets up and said look you ' ve had your supper you ' ve sat down for long enough you ' ve ignored me for long enough and i ' ve been very good i haven't hassled you you know it ' s time we played duck   this is not the picture of an active dog with its chin on the table his eyelids drooping  i think it ' s to do with the fact that he ' s terrified of this machine that ' s whirring away in front of him   he ' s getting up to investigate   laugh  look i ' m i ' m almost finished sacred hunger  i ' m onto page two hundred and fifty and i ' ve got how many more pages uhm last page is six hundred and thirty ok so six thirty minus three fifty how how much is that   three three  uh two eighty   well i was reading that book when was i reading that book  i don't know   a year ago  well i started reading it when i when we went on to yangtze river    and then you stopped  yeah well the print is too small  th this this new one which is i think uhm thicker by about one third i bought in england and this one ' s got larger print  this has got larger print and this one is about what two thirds as thick as uh hitler and stalin   yeah laugh  that ' s next on your list right  yep hitler and stalin i i think hitler and stalin i ' m gonna sort of read it uhm in read it while reading other things and when i want a bit of you know excitement then i ' ll read hitler and stalin laugh   re rest of the time i ' ll read upamanyu chatterjee and you know folk like that    the other thing i remember about the sacred hunger apart from the fact that i really liked it is the very beginning which is about the  paradise nigger who turns up in either new orleans or st louis or somewhere  oh yes yes yes yes yes   and then the mutiny bit in the middle somewhere  well i haven't got to the mutiny bit   oh i ' d better not tell you then  no because i i look i ' ve passed gone past the middle the mutiny bit is obviously not in the middle laugh i but i think it ' s coming like the weather is coming  laugh  yeah it ' s coming  it ' s really jolly good i must say it ' s very impressive  very impressive indeed pause    well i think i ' m gonna finish singapore grip before you finish that  do you think so   uhm uhm  what ' s it about   it ' s about singapore in the nineteen forties uhm and it ' s just one-word  the japs were there   the japanese have just invaded malaya and they ' re coming steaming down the peninsula and there are a few chapters they ' re going to come to singapore  and that ' s gonna be the end of the line for most of them  it ' s very it ' s fun it ' s funny it ' s rather like that the first one uhm the irish one whose name i ' ve forgotten  $a laughed s story i ' ve also forgotten about a hotel in ireland anyway the main character in that first in the irish one turns up again here sort of twenty years older in the singapore grip but it ' s very peculiar because the middle one in the trilogy is set in the indian  mutiny back in eighteen fifty seven or nine or whenever it was so it goes in a funny direction  chris name  he he died shortly after writing this book he died in an accident i think he was he was drowned he went on a fishing expedition in in ireland somewhere so he wasn't all that old  how old was he when was he born   i don't know  does it say does it say on the blurb   i don't know  born in nineteen thirty-five  nineteen thirty-five   and died in nineteen seventy-nine  nineteen seventy-nine   yep  that ' s quite young then when he died    yep  yep he got the booker prize in seven t tr troubles that ' s right first one is called troubles  right   the middle one is the seige of krishnapur that ' s the one that got the booker prize in seventy-three  right   and this one seventy-eight the year before he died  booker prize has been on the go for a very long time  hasn't it  did you see that article on singapore on the in the in the eastern express today about how it was turning itself into into an a real hub of technology i think that ' s what the conference is about yeah the conference on the unwritten  because i mean the whole stuff of it if you get the article in in the eastern express which is it ' s actually got from the guardian actually begins by saying that all this stuff in the informations is about three words is that  you turn you turn the words into into machine code uh it travels down  some kind of you know uhm    i read about i read about half of it   five words  digital fibre optic   yeah yeah yeah and uhm i think that ' s what the unwritten is about all about   uhm  i ' ve been trying to interest my friends into going to this conference nobody laugh has shown slightest interest in it so far   well i will go to this conference  the only drawback that would prevent me from going to this conference is that you ' re going to go well i don't think we we should go to the same conference     no i don't want any more conferences four words  yeah i mean i think it ' s boring   thanks honey  anyway i thought the the unwritten was all about things like  performance  ah that ' s what you think   and and then three words   it ' s old rather old-fashioned view of the unwritten    multiple words problems there i mean you think it ' s all about the information superhighway well why not  it ' s unwritten right   well four words  it must be written to be on the information  superhighway   three words it depends on what you mean by but then yeah the the thing is that these words get translated into machine code  is the is machine code written   well it must be i mean dog barking  anyway so tell me about the conference today  well i don't know i mean it ' s  well the first session it was it was supposed to be two people there a wo this one woman from the philippines uhm who was supposed to talk about writing by american jews and filipino chinese    one-word  she she ' s a writer  no no no no she ' s i don't know what she is but she ' s affiliated to some school i think she ' s she ' s a high school teacher but the blurb she sent to the conference was extremely brief very vague  uhm and and oh and the only thing three words  the the the only thing i could make out from it was that she ' s going to talk about american jews and filipino chinese and and about the literature they produce   uhm sounds quite interesting  yeah but i mean you know i mean that ' s a rather vast leap across time and space without any indication i mean real indication i think as uh you know about what she was going to say apart apart from saying things like you know representing themselves but then you know so what so anyway but anyway she she didn't turn up i think she probably couldn't get funding to come or  something like that uhm and then there was this guy from uhm from melbourne and he was quite good he was quite good and he ' s he ' s really a historian and he seems he knows norman owen apparently   uhm uhm  or at least they introduced themselves to each other norman was i gather policing the precinct with all these guys wearing red badges as a sort of    he ' s he ' s chairing various things one-word  he  well yes he ' s also part of the one of the conference organizers so  there there are yellow badges red badges and white badges red badges were people like elizabeth and norman you know people actually sort of getting their you know sort of getting their hands dirty doing things    uhm  yep  uhm yellow badges are for some some kind of the general crowd and white badges are for people like myself chairing    who are the people like yourself  chairing sessions  i don't know what you get if both chair sessions and give papers that is not known to me  but anyway this guy came and he he wha well he thought  he he he gave his paper on what he called uhm sino what he called the sino-malay paradigm in modern indonesian literature he said the official view of indonesian literature uhm a modern indonesian literature is that it started in nineteen twenties  okay began in nineteen twenties a modern indonesian literature began in nineteen twenties etcetera  now     uhm is it when people started writing in something that wasn't dutch  well i suppose so i suppose that ' s what it meant but but the interesting thing  that this guy was saying was that there ' s actually a huge body of writing  what he called sino-malay writing and i picked him up on that uhm at question time because i wasn't sure what he meant by that he kept calling it the sino-malay paradigm and then at various  sort of moments in the paper he referred to chinese malay literature so i wasn't sure what sino-malay the term that he actually used uh meant does it mean uhm people of chinese ethnicity or ancestry writing in malay or low malay he calls it uh     what is it  low malay i ' ll i ' ll i ' ll i ' ll tell you what ' s the difference between low and high in a minute but low malay or is sino-malay a hyphenated term uhm does it refer to a hybrid language a creolized language or or or or you know things like that  and uhm it wasn't clear from his paper what he was talking about really whether he was so i i actually took him up on that and he got rather anxious for some reason and kept saying oh yes yes i uh wrote this paper very quickly and and very hurriedly and i didn't have time to clarify my terms very sorry there ' s this confusion i mean he was extremely apologetic  i mean i wasn't     one-word never thought about it  well i think he didn't but i thought that was actually basic  uhm to a paper that is about linguistic and cultural politics uhm and  he sees it well because it ' s just that ' s what the paper is about he said well the traditional view of malay of of sorry of indonesian uh national literature actually excludes this sino-malay stuff saying either that it ' s it ' s uhm a a separate autonomous development  right or saying that it ' s uhm exclusively chinese ok so it ' s got nothing to do with names you know what natives and other people presumably uhm or saying that it ' s uh in low malay and therefore not really kind of not really acceptable now l low malay uh seems really the malay of the market place as opposed to high malay which is educated malay and the established view the official view of indonesian literature seems to suggest that before independence most literature was written in high malay and that is the the tradition as it were     uhm yeah  yeah  but this guy was saying in fact the archive this he ' s s  said that there ' s a lot of archival material there ' s about three thousand items at least he said of stuff which is produced in the sino-malay uhm language or well we call it you know the sino-malay literature uhm and he said it it wasn't exclusively chinese people who were the people of chinese ancestors who ' s using this language but then everybody was uh who could use it used it and it wasn't exclusively on uhm uhm and it wasn't such and because of that therefore it wasn't sort of separate it wasn't autonomous on on on an autonomous tradition it should be con considered he said as a kind of moment in the development of modern indonesian literature   uhm  now of course he said and then he went on said that of course the political reasons as to why people take this view  especially after independence when all this high and low malay stuff was replaced by bahasa indonesia standard indonesian language and and you know the uh and people just just have to write in that language  so i asked him i said you know look i mean i wasn't try to pick holes in your arguments simple thing is that i want to know because is it a language uh sino-malay a language like the barbar language which is a hybridized language which is as english as its uhm main kind of uhm stand as it were uhm and then has you know malay words has sort of hokkian anglicized hokkian kind of words and things like that and i said the barbar language is dying out uh will the barbar community be dispersed    yeah  yeah  and i said oh no no no no he said that well it ' s not as clear-cut as that  two-words and in indonesia because he said i said is is low malay use there still he said the older generation still uses it and he said that people who speak bahasa indonesia or people who use high malay or use or know high malay actually recognizes the language  you see so it is    one word people can understand that  yeah can understand that although he said he gave the examples of the different grammatical forms but it ' s a recognizable it ' s it ' s a recognizable language    two words  was this guy chinese  no no no no no no no well his name is koppel k o p p uh c o p p no k o p p e l ss  australian so i assume australian german descent and uh well he ' s a historian and he ' s accumulated a huge amount of material but it ' s general he ' s generally interested in indonesia so he speaks indonesian  and uh i suppose bahasa indonesian  but anyway so it was it was actually quite interesting uhm i think he knows a bit about the kind of you know current theoretical literary cultural theory uhm on this sort of thing on identity   where ' s where ' s he from  uhm melbourne   university  yeah melbourne melbourne university and uhm so he was saying things oh you know whether you call the uh established view the official view as the master narrative or hegemonic discourse   oh  and other things you know but but taking a sort of rather sort of sort of   slightly cynical view of terms like that but basically it ' s it is that kind of theoretical framework that he is operating in   yep  and the idea of you know reinstating this uh sino-malay uhm literature in tradition or perhaps inflecting i would say the official paradigm with this you know sino-malay what he called sino-malay paradigm but it ' s actually he ' s trying to inflect the official paradigm with it  so that was quite interesting the afternoon session was were just three readings one by this  woman uhm who was i think a malaysian malaysian chinese woman who is now actually monash uh whom i told you about earlier on and was extraordinarily i mean she read her stuff it wasn't awful but you know she read it in this   this is the psychiatrist  yeah she read it in this kind of you know old dramatic way which or what she called grammatic way   doing different doing the voices  well no but gesturing and and and and and kind of pacing i think basically to make up for the lack of interest in the content    really
