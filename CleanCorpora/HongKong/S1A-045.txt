no i will try my best to prepare my exam
uhm
uhm i have i have i have 
i think i have a very good pan plan for my
examinations
uh i have already taken eight courses i want to finish had
the first round revision uh at the end of april
uhm
uh up to now i ' ve finished four courses
 
 uh uhm 
 wah 
yeah
that ' s very good
but uh sometime it ' s very easy to out of my schedule because
 uhm some some temptation laughs 
 uhm 
 
what kind of temptation 
too serious laughs 
 
temptation 
for example uh for example uhm two-cantonese-words
 uh maybe laughs maybe uh it ' s too uhm uh uh it ' s
difficult to concentrate uh on a cer on a certain uh thing
for example uh if i mean if i just concentrate on my uh study
 uh i will it will loaner lower my efficiency
so uh some i think some temptation maybe uh i i want to 
tal always like to talk with somebodies or or
somebody uh phone me and hey go go go to go to 
 uh 
 uhm 
 go for a movie
go to movie go to shopping
uh something like that 
yeah uh maybe i ' m because in study room man many brother
sisters ' re here
yeah
uh somebody will come to disturb me 
$b-and-$z-laugh say something uh very very long
 uhm 
meaningless all-laugh 
yes
how about you
then will will it be better if you stay here to study
because there are no one to disturb you
i don't think so 
because i ' m i ' ve i can't i ' m i ' m i ' m 
 
 can't stay in the house the whole
day 
 yes i will feel very lonely
 
uhm 
i can't uh i can't stand or if no one talk
with me the whole day
 
so these five days every day you will go back to study 
room to study 
 yes 
yes although i ' m very ill 
i i i i also insist uh to go back to study room because
there ' re many people here 
uhm i think it ' s it ' s maybe this uh problem of security
something like that
 uhm 
 
 yeah 
uh also uhm uh their uh there ' s now some construction
work outside 
 it ' s very noisy in the morning
 
 yeah oh 
 yeah 
yeah
 
uhm 
yes so so i think it ' s not good
and also it ' ll the atmosphere here is
 is very loose uh and sometime when i look look at
my bed i want to sleep all-laugh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 aiya 
too lazy
yes uh so uh i prefer to have study in uh hku
but don't you think it will be very tiring if you stay in the
study room all day
 
 uhm 
but i think there ' re many varieties there that i can uh go
outside to talk with somebody
i can uh go upstair to have tea or go down to do
something i like to do exercise laughs or 
 
 one-word and buy buy snacks at
 park'n shop 
 or yeah yeah yeah yeah to buy snacks
 oh it ' s very dangerous you know 
all-laugh 
i won't go to study room
yeah maybe
there ' s uh also the tv room reading room i can do anything i want
so uh maybe the area is much uhm large and 
also make me more comfort in a open area uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
then do you think other brother and sister will uh
return to study room to study during the easter holiday
 uhm 
uhm maybe maybe somebo somebody will come 
 who who will come laughs 
i don't know but uh
 
 uhm 
 your your guest

one star 
one star
 
i think he has to type his project

i i always think that it is 
$z-laughs monday
 aw because uh my family had planned
 to visit on monday
 no no 
 uhm 
oh yeah
but i easter holiday is too too short
 yeah 
 
 too short 
yeah 
almost invisible
yeah i remember that uh it quite a long holiday when
i ' m secondary school
yeah
 
uhm 
two weeks or about maybe
 
 uhm 
uhm
yeah 
uh oh it doesn't matter all-laugh 
uh i don't think we can do anything to celebrate 
because of the examination
 aw 
but uh yesterday i bought two two chocolate
oh
 
oh 
to to 
 i ' m wondering this morning who bought those
chocolates
yeah the chocolates uhm
 
eggs 
 eggs 
 with chicken
yeah chicken 
 
 easter eggs 
uh it ' s quite uh elegant packaging
is it expensive
twenty eight for all
 is it expensive 
actually laughs it ' s uh quite expensive for such 
s 
 four words 
yeah only three small chocolate eggs
yeah and only a what
a chicken
 
oh it ' s a small chicken in the egg 
 it ' s small chicken but actually it ' s very 
cheap as actually
 
yeah 
i think the cost less than ten dollar laughs 
 
oh yes 
uhm
but but the appearance quite attractive and i think it
will uh chong suk and binak will like it
 
oh you bought it for them 
 uhm 
yeah
oh yeah
but most of i think most of the children will like it if
i ' m chil i am ch children i would like
i have never eaten a real easter egg
have you ever eaten them
 uhm 
what ' s the real chocolate
 
 real easter egg 
real easter egg laughs 
 
 two-words a real egg 
uhm
 
a real easter egg is available 
look uhm 
for example if you uh if you if you go to some hotel
 
oh i see 
they will uh made some egg uh from
chocolate
 
 uhm 
 aw 
 aw 
with uh very beautiful decoration especially for easter
for example rabbits and houses chicken
 uhm 
oh oh e oh i i see cos i ' m some some of the easter egg
 uh in rabbit shape
yeah
but it ' s quite expensive laughs 
yeah
so i i can't buy them
 three-words 
have you ever tasted them
 
no not in the chocolate ones
i don't like so much 
 but real egg
 
i think a real easter egg is just a real hardboiled egg 
uhm
aw
 
that ' s what my a american friends do 
aw
 
they boil the egg and then they paint on the
egg
 they use food dye to
paint on the egg and they keep it and then on easter
day you go and look for the eggs and after that you can eat
it 
 uhm 
 oh 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 aw 
 three-words easter easter egg in the
church uh this year
 
 yeah 
uh i ' ve also got one
 
 they give you real egg 
oh in no no not in my church in ken ' s church 
because uh yes uh bap 
 oh 
 
baptism 
baptism and his church uh has has celebration and every
brother and sister have a red
 
red color 
red uh boiled egg
it ' s for easter or because of the baptism
for easter cause uh his baptism is in easter
 oh 
so 
anyway
last week when i when i went to church
 one of my sister ask me whether i will like to go for
baptism this uh this may
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
 oh 
uhm
this may
but i think
you have to prepare your exam
yeah because i have to attend many class if i really
want to 
 
 yeah no time to attend 
yes 
but really i quite like the church i am
attending and i think uh someday i will
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
uhm
baptised
yeah
oh i see
how about the next chance to have baptism
oh i think it will be
 
christmas 
perhaps
uhm 
uhm it ' s good i think uh uh it may be much better to
have uh to let you know more about your church and then
you ' ll baptise there
 yeah 
yeah and also i want to make friends with the
brother and sister and i want to get get to know them
more before i receive my baptism
 uhm 
 uhm 
 
uhm 
 
uhm uhm
i see 
why why why do you like what what uh what thing that uh
attract me
yeah
i think it uh it is mainly because of
their love 
because i even though sometimes when i went
to went to have fellowship with them they will play and
they will uh 
they will play and it seems that they don't have deep
relationship 
but uh i discover that it is not the case because uh 
 last week they went for a camp and in the camp they pray
together and they have very deep sharing and they cry
together because uhm they discover that there are sins in themselves
 uhm 
 oh 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
oh
 and i discover i discover that there are other aspects of them
 that that are really brother and sister uh just
like the environment here but i think the
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
they are much they ' re one-word 
 
 did you go for the camp 
no originally i would i would like to go but because oh
because i have many projects to finish so i 
cannot afford to go
 
 oh yeah 
 uhm 
uhm uhm
uhm uhm
and also i think they are very welcome
uhm
uhm uhm
and i really enjoy the morning praise and worship
with them
 
 uhm 
 oh 
the style is very similar to ccc they
also use transparency and most of the songs they sing i also
know 
and i think they are very alive and very uh energetic
when they sing a song 
for example they will do many action
 oh 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm
 two-words 
 uhm 
uhm uhm 
 and they will clap their hands
uhm uhm uhm
and and also sometimes uh they will invite some of the
brother and sister to share their personal experience
 on uh on uh sharing the gospel or helping the new
believer to get to know more about god
and i think i will i think this church can help me to know
god more even after i graduate from this school
and also i personally i think i can be
used by god in this church because the main objective of this
church is quite similar to
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
ccc
yeah for example uhm uh to share the
gospel with with uh the people in cheung chau or or to
uhm help help new believer to get to know more about god
 uhm 
 
 uhm 
uhm i ' m sorry
i i forgot the name of the church 
$a-laughs 
 
in english 
uh
 
cheung chau 
cheung chau what
 
alliance to 
ah yeah
alliance
because i never laughs i ' ve never called my church
in english 
actually i ' m planning to uhm ask you something the method to
study japanese uh huh and also some some may be further
about my career cos i ' m going to graduate this year and uhm
i have no idea about how to make use of those languages that i have learnt
such as japanese i ' m studying right now
so uhm i have no idea about how to use it in my later
career 
 
 uh hoh uh hoh uh hoh 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
so your question is difficult question because i don't know it
 edo so you you are going to nani to
include job in the in the japanese ' s company or uh the ordinary 
 i i i of course i want to take a job
in japanese company so that i can use the uhm japanese i have learned
right now 
but uhm my japanese is not that good so i ' m 
i ' m quite worried about this yup
 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uh uh 
 e choto evelyn san 
 hai hai hai hai 
 
you know that i think this question is very uh somehow serious
 i think
so if i had uh if i na ni i try to answer to
that question may be i consider longer or uh uh
and if you na ni if you want me just talk
 in english then i just the the the other
topic is better because this is how to say how to say this matter is very
serious to you and me both you and i uh i
so i have to consider if i answer to you 
 na ni so so so so how may be more just if
just you need the the nani english talking
itself no other no other of this yeah then 
okay then the then then when you we we how to say the other kind
of topic is better i think uh ha ha ha 
 uhm 
 uh uhm 
 yah 
 yeah just simply talk 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 may be at the previous 
 uhm uhm just english talking no matter what we talk yah yeah
but i just 
 uhm may be uh if you like we can have some casual talk 
 about your living style in hong kong uh
such kind of it depends which style you like 
 
 okay 
 uhm uhm yeah 
uhm uhm okay
so it ' s better to uhm talk with the general matters like uh
cultural or foods or something 
then may be yeah it ' s it ' s not respons 
i ' m i ' m not responsible to that eh that kind
 uh uhm problem you know about you career or your future 
and japanese study and i have to think it over
okay okay ii desu ka 
 let ' s start 
 uhm uhm 
 yes sure 
 of course it ' s better for me 
 yeah sure sure 
 yeah 
 yeah yeah 
 hai hai hai 
 
 hai edo uh soo desu 
then then then what uh uhm so any kind of na ni 
conversation is i ask you or you ask me to 
 uhm 
uhm yeah yeah it ' s okay both direction is okay but just
simply uhm yeah 
 
 na ni uhm hah oh i see uhm 
 so okay so then then then the then uh actually i ' m now how
to say uh uhm interested in uh what kind of activity do students are doing uh
outside of the university because in japan many
university student they are they they how to say they part 
 
 uhm 
 do the part-time job 
 
yes do the part-time job and they they do hold parties so many
times and so how about you the students in hong kong 
uhm uhm hong kong students uh 
for me and also for my friends also but have also part-time
jobs such as uhm uh private teacher to teacher to
teach those secondary students or the primary students english or
mathematics 
and apart from having the part-time job usually we ' ll
tend to play some kind of sports 
uh for me i like badminton and squash and some
of them they would like to play uhm other kinds such tennis 
 and but usually for girls they like shopping
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm 
uhm uhm uhm i see so okay and then uh but is it easy to find the
job part-time job uhm 
quite easy because uhm i uh i
 
 uhm uhm uhm 
you do find that kind of job by yourself or uh through 
some uh 
 by some introduction
 
uh huh 
uh actually there are there are many different kinds of ways
 to do so 
uh i don't know whether you notice it in parknshop or in welcome
 those supermarket 
 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm aw notice board 
yah yah yah the notice board and you will
 see that there are a lot of notice 
a lot of them are 
 
 aw aw aw aw 
 aw 
 notice 
 and they take some paper uh with the
contact number uhm 
 yah yah yah are put up by the students who want
to find to find some part-time jobs 
and then they will leave the contacted number there
 so that when the mothers or the fathers they want to
find a part-time tutor for their children they can contact it
is one of the means
 and also there are some other means such as some
some of my friends may try to telephone to some uhm to some
institute that institute are opened for those uh students
 to study there
yeah 
 
 aw 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm hoh hoh 
 aw 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
and do you like na ni uh the student
university student can teach there or with their tra 
training or without 
 yeah yeah 
 no they did without training
 
 wo wo so aw 
 in japan they need to be trained
 
uh usually home tutor they don't have any training 
 but the you know there are many institute uh or cra cram cram
cram school there there are many cram schools and the the
competition uh among the are really strict so they have to train the teachers
 so uhm uhm i think it ' s uh 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm cram school 
 oh so 
it ' s very different 
 
 uhm 
it ' s not very difficult but it ' s not very easy of
uhm beside there are many universities in japan so of course
there are more university students in japan uh than hong kong
uh there are only six universities in hong kong and 
so university students are prestigious in hong kong but in japan are you were
you university student and so what like that 
 uhm 
everyone is
 
yeah everyone is so uhm it soon 
 but it depends on the uh fame of that
university
 
uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm
yes it depends uhm so uhm like tokyo university uh and
they so they i think they are easy to find that kind of job
uh uhm so uhm and uh but uh i i think uh al they are
also many universities student do they are doing part-time job like uh
mcdonald ' s clerk or uhm ahno fa
 the restaurant waiter or waitress
so but i think who there are are few students university student
they ' re doing that kind of job they they are that ho ho ho
 
 uhm of course it is the best 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 yes but the salary is very low yeah 
uh as for for those who as in mcdonald the 
salary is about fifteen or eighteen dollars per
hour 
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 fifteen honto very
low 
 one five one eight per per hour 
but as for us if we work as a tutor then plus a
zero
 a hundred and fifty which is ten
 times more
so we seldom do that in mcdonald ' s 
 
 uhm 
 aw right right right 
 so ten ten times aw 
 but i think do doing a tutor you have to prepare
for them as or you do not 
uh for me it depends on the standard 
 of the child 
if he is really not very good then i have to get
 more some more exercise for him but for for those students in
hong kong usually they are not really bad but their parents
are just simply too anxious about their results so find a
tutor to help him more
 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 yeah uhm sometimes you can't get bonus from the
parents when they took it one-word good uhm
right 
 uh bonus not really bonus but uh for example if
in times of christmas than i may have a christmas present
 or uhm in times of the lunar year then i will
have the red packet yeah 
 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
wow ii desu ne good 
is that the same case in japan
 
uh i think so uh there are several rumour about that uh there is
a university student who who is how to say who is pupil no uh the child who
who uh he ' s teaching uh na ni entered a famous may be
famous high school or something then he had he has got new
car from the parents 
 uhm uhm 
 aw new car 
 wow 
 
 uhm i think so but this is all very how to say a
kind of legend not the true story legend i think 
may be but in sometimes we can get some present uh when the
pupils uh na ni got uh got the new good uh good grade
but the you know the na ni season of the examination how
to say we have summer cake during that during that
time don't you think so 
 aw 
 really 
 summer cake 
oh i don't have
 
oh you are now so responsible then
uhm uh we used to uhm right 
 so i uh may be uhm my student right
now the one student i ' m having right now uhm is not that he
doesn't study in the very famous uh school so 
the pressure is not that much 
but for the previous student he ' s studying in uhm
la salle primary school wh which is a very famous school
in hong kong 
and actually there ' s no particular season of 
examination because every week he got every three quizzes
 and one month then he will have the big test so every
every so i ' m i accustomed to to this kind of 
 
 yeah 
 aw 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm 
 aw uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 yeah aw 
 uhm uhm uhm 
and you you also has that kind of experience when you were in
that age right i assume and you want that i assume uh uhm uh uh
 yeah yeah similar 
actually i accustomed this yeah i think is it the
same case in japan because
 
 uhm uhm uhm oh i see 
uh the competition among the student
yes they are
uh you know the entrance examination of universities are really
competitive uhm uhm so yes and the to enter the prestigious university then
you have to uh enter the en enter the good high
school uhm
and to enter the good high school to enter you you have to to
enter the good primary school like that so it ' s it ' s
hierarchy that kind of
so uhm yup uhm but after the entrance examination then they want
they they they want to uh they then they how how to say they don't want to
study more anymore a kind of a uhm 
uhm yeah somehow uhm but normally its in my days uh is uh how to
say enjoyable i mean in the university the we we really enjoy not worry about
but now the uh how to say to for a for the university student it is its
really difficult to find a job in in japan now because uh
japanese economy is not very good now so uhm so i think they have to study or
they have to get some uh qualification or certification of 
some business skills 
 uhm 
 yes 
 enter high school 
 primary school 
 uhm 
 because tired of study 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 professional 
 
yes the professional skills
so i think they are studying more than 
before
 
before uhm much more than uhm uhm 
 now i think its also the same
case in hong kong cos really the unemployment rate is very
high recently
so and there are increasing number of universities graduates 
 so it ' s very also difficult for hong kong students 
 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 aw uhm uhm uhm 
uhm uhm so you ' re in third year now so you already started
started to na ni finding jobs 
 find jobs uhm yes
 
 uhm 
 i have uh quite a number of application fo
 letters have been posted but uhm i have been requested {
2> to perform some written test but uhm the result
is still not not over yet 
 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
uh so usually to find jobs uh as you were a the how to say
freshman in the uh i mean na ni uh you are just going to graduate so
you don't have uh business experience right
so so in in that case how na ni how do you
find jobs in private rela relationship or i mean through the private
relationship or you you use uh some uh how to say or organisation
 or something 
 uhm uhm uhm 
uh uh for right now i ' m finding some job as it ' s
for a life-long career so uh there is a career centre 
 in hong kong university in in somewhere out there 
so uhm i just go there
 and there are a lot of notices put up so
i can submit through this method
and for my previous experience i have tired
to find some job in my uh summer vacation uh for this i just read
 uh south china morning post 
so by this kind of means i apply it a few words
 jobs
 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm 
 uhm uhm uhm uhm 
aw it ' s a how to say open in the uhm uhm 
 it ' s open 
is it the same case in japan
 
uhm officially it ' s really open
but official open but they how to say all the students know there
are many how to say not not official ways you know uh how it ' s
difficult 
 officially 
 not official ways 
 
that mean uh 
 through relationship 
 
through relationship uh yes
not uhm of course they are of course they are open how to say
examination were na ni uh a noo uhm
yup but the uhm i don't know how how many percent but the memo a su
 uhm many part of the job na ni seeker they
find their jobs through their their parents rela relationships 
 or who were the the el elder students 
of their own own university uhm and yes through that kind
of relationship they ask them to introduce someone in charge and 
 uh huh 
 uh huh 
 uhm 
aw it ' s really good 
 
 uhm uhm uhm 
so yes so uhm so sometimes it ' s a it works i mean
 uhm uhm
uhm uhm really uhm yes because of course
there are many open area uhm but the uhm they how to say i i
mean the companies they want have some guarantee to na ni
 to hire new person so you know this person so you
want to have some guarantee so if they na ni
 find some person through the relationships then uhm uhm
like that 
so i think uhm of course there are some some students uhm yeah
their parents or their relatives are very powerful in the society 
like that so-called the this kind of na ni uhm
relationship work will help in uh uhm 
 it works 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 uhm 
 uh uh 
 since somebody know them better
oh i see 
 uh huh 
 but which one is not common
 
 uhm 
 through relationship or through those open area 
 
open uh through the open ways should be more advantage 
uhm but you know there are no actual uh na ni 
 statistics about this because they don't don't they don't tell
them uh about that so uhm
but uh i think yah i think uh men men the male students they can
 na ni they e they are is it easier to them to
find the job through the open way i think but to for female
student i think uhm i think some time they have to relay on this kind of 
 relationships uhm uhm 
 yah yah 
 yah yah yah 
 yeah 
 uhm 
 relationship 
is it really that uh women is very difficult to find job in japan
 much difficult than men 
 
 uhm generally yes uhm but uhm so ne
 much much better than before uhm 
so because there there are many capable uhm woman
now uhm i think
uhm yeah uhm so yeah somehow different but uh usually it is said
that uh jap in in japan there are hard discrimination among uh women
but uh i think it ' s a it ' s how to say it ' s uh a kind of st
 stereotype uhm information uhm
they yeah we we do have that kind of discrimination but it ' s not
the that simple i think
uhm because some woman really want to be in domestic in the house
 want they want
it ' s not discrimination so uhm
of course someone there are somebody they doesn't want want be in
uh they don't want to be in home but but they cannot find a

tokyo then nagono or shitsuke yoketa sensai
