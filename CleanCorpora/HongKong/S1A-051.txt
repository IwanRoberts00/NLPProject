 
""
well actually in fact i just finished my exams uhm this week 
 and so  
""
""
 oh / [ >  that  ' s great
 
""
yeah now uhm i  ' m on my summer holidays uh 
""
""
wow
 
""
yeah   however school  starts yah only two weeks
""
and school starts in april where uhm i  ' ll be going to uhm kowloon
hospital  dung wah  tung wah hospital and uhm queen elizabeth
hospital doing uhm ent uh which is surgery about    two words
  
""
""
 but this  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 ent  
""
is it something   related  to the housemen housemanship
 
""
 yeah from  
""
oh no this is not housemanship
""
it  ' s just uhm like what happen is have to uhm undergo three i
mean not ten specialty 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
and after my specialty i  ' ll be going on to my elective and then i  ' ll
start my houseman 
""
""
i see
 
""
yah but uhm because the like there are ten specialty right so it
takes at least one year to complete 
""
""
uhm
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
what about vernice are you going to the engineering field 
a  soon after your graduation
""
""
yes i think so
""
""
yes but uhm did you apply any jobs that  ' s related to your
field
""
""
no
""
""
not yet   or 
 
""
 not yet   
""
""
  or no reply  right now
""
""
 uh i  ' m writing  
""
uh i i like this job
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and yeah this job
 
""
so you are doing something already you mean she already had a job
""
""
""
no i mean is she on  cu  currently apply any jobs
related to the field
""
but don't you know that uhm the general you know the atmosphere in
economic field is not very  tut  i mean   keep it 
""
""
 pleasant  
""
""
yah it  ' s quite it  ' s quite gloomy that
 
""
that gloomy 
""
""
yah that people are actually worrying about whether yah they
have found a job or not
 
""
uh huh 
""
""
yes
 
""
but isn't the same as engineering field   because  
 i thought  
""
""
 yah  
""
 the  
 
""
i thought   engineering  is better 
""
""
 specialist  
""
""
i think uhm uh at this   moment  uhm  tut  uh
  jobs yeah  yeah have many chances
""
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
 available  
""
aw   still that  ' s  good 
""
""
 so yah  
""
""
yeah this is really great   because  you  ' re  
specialist 
""
""
 because  
""
   two-words   and many construction
projects in hong kong   yeah    the  large projects
 
""
 oh   
""
""
 uh huh 
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
actually if you work in the in this field what kind of
position uh will be given to a  fre  fresh graduate in civil
engineering
""
""
graduate engineer
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
uhm then i will be trained for   three  year
 
""
 training   
""
""
yah   for  three years and then will be promote to
uhm assistant engineer
""
""
 aw  
""
i   see 
""
assistant only
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yah
""
""
three years   of 
""
""
 if   i can pass   the professional  
 examination 
 
""
 three years of training  
""
 yah yah she take   she has to take the professional
exam yah 
""
""
i see
""
""
  right 
 
""
 for   getting promoted to become assistant 
""
""
yah
 
""
  uh i see  
""
""
 so   if you pass the exam you will become a
""
""
an just an engineer or a chartered engineer
""
""
a chartered that mean just like the certified accountant 
 that  mean they can carry out projects   really   
not  assistant anymore
""
""
 yah  
""
 yah  
""
 no  
""
yah   but  that is just the beginning because uhm uhm i
think uh we can also promote to uh senior the chief and the project manager
or something like that
 
""
 wow   
""
""
uhm uhm project manager
""
  i  see   uhm 
""
""
 yah  
""
 and   i think that is uhm  tut  will be in the
 mana  management level   and  uhm just to manage the whole
project will not uh just do the calculation or prepare the uhm design yah
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
but what about site site supervision uhm uhm
""
""
uhm in site supervision uhm there  ' s also uhm the uhm resident
engineer   the  uhm senior resident engineer and the chief resident
engineer
""
""
 uh huh  
""
i   see 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
that means you still need to carry out  ce  certain
kind of supervision that means you have to got to the site   and 
and have some kind   of  supervision
""
  i  see
""
""
 yah  
""
 yah  
""
 and   i think in my training the three year training
  i  should have uh to gain the uhm  tut  site experience
  for at  least one yeah
""
""
 uh huh  
""
 uhm uhm  
 
""
yeah i suppose so   yeah  
""
""
  two-words   
""
well it seems that it  ' s not so easy to become an civil engineer
""
""
because it   is a  professional
 
""
 long time almost 
""
yah definitely it  ' s professional 
""
""
is it the   same 
""
""
 just   like a doctor
""
""
yah is it the same uh with the medical field
 
""
well for medical training well uhm the basic bachelor are five
years
""
only gave you uhm years the the the the principle of the  ge
 general background of each uhm specialty
""
however uhm if you really want to specialise in one subject for
example head and neck   okay  or surgery then you have to go on
to post-grad training   which  last at least four to five years
""
and of course uhm you have to undergo uh progression exams 
   you know and uhm practical like uh bedside you know  
uhm    examination  and uh yeah that  ' s about it  
 
""
what i i don't know the programme exactly but uhm this is what
just what i  ' ve heard   from  my other uhm colleagues 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
  uhm  huh 
""
""
 then do you think  then you two do you think that
what you are right now doing   is  what you really uhm want to
strike in your life
 
""
 uh huh    b and z laugh 
""
well it  ' s difficult to say because uhm well at present i am only
in year three and i  ' ll be going to year four     and uhm
well for the for the past three years uhm well i still enjoy medicine and uh
i enjoy working with patients   yeah uhm  i think the subject
like it  ' s not easy okay and i probably have to spend a lot of time  
  uh i don't know studying yah and well it just likely that uhm
doctor will be my career 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 yeah huh  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
uhm uhm
 
""
yeah my future   job and  uh because i have already
spent what five years  two-words 
""
yeah well but if i cannot get a job   then  well i
probably have to what go back to canada   or  or or do nursing
something because it  ' s hard to say you know medicine are really saturated
like doctors   but  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
""
 aw  
""
""
 uhm uhm   because it  ' s my belief that  
if  you have the interest it motivates you towards what you are striking
for what you are looking   for 
 
""
 uh huh   
""
""
 oh  
""
""
uhm uhm and   is it  is it your i mean the perfect
job that you are looking looking for i mean the civil engineer
""
""
 interesting  
""
uhm  tut  at this moment i think so
""
""
you think so
""
""
yah
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
what about you tell me about your programme 
""
""
actually uhm you know as an english and japanese student i
really want to have a job that uh i can make use of what i  ' ve learnt 
 but  it still it still very general because what i learn is
something related to grammar or   or  related to linguistics
   
""
its nothing to do with language
""
so when i work what kind of work job should i should i choose 
 uh  well personally i like job that is related to  cul 
culture
""
  uhm  i mean if i can work in the museum or the any
kind of uhm that i see many relate to culture or culture exchange like uhm
the hong kong tourist association   like  uhm or even the
cultural centre any  pos  any position in the cultural centre or
related to the urban council in the cultural field it will be fine
 
""
 yeah   
""
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
 uhm  
""
uhm uhm
""
""
yah because i just love the environment
""
yah don't know what to what to see but yah i just like love love
the atmosphere yah
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
it  ' s not my pager
""
it  ' s your pager isn't it
""
""
yah
""
""
because i think there  ' s something shaking but   it  ' s
not may pager 
 
""
 oh my goodness   
""
""
are you fine
""
""
yah
""
""
your friend called you i suppose
 
""
so you are sitting on it 
""
""
   laughter  it still work 
""
""
 just   just next to me   no 
""
i haven't made anything on it
 
""
 okay okay   
""
""
really
""
""
really trust me
""
really yah
 
""
yah 
""
""
by the way do you know that the new uhm the new newly
released uh result on the lady ho tung hall
 
""
no 
 no   that  this old building will be   pulled  down
and then a new slab block will be built    and  together on the
side there will be uhm a building of student flats
 
""
 what happened  
""
 oh really  
""
 uh huh  
""
okay but when was that 
""
""
ninety eight nineteen ninety eight
 
""
oh that  ' s okay   i will be  off by then
""
i think i already graduate uh   huh  
""
""
 that  ' s  o   
""
 yah   but but it  ' s of course it will be fine if you
are  gra  if you are going to graduate and   will not 
disturb you  but   it will not disturb you but uhm yah i just
don't want this building to be pulled down   yah 
 
""
 huh huh  
""
 yah  
""
 aw     oh  
""
""
 but   after all after all we have been here for a
few years   and we  don't want to see  tut  this beautiful
being become   nothing  when we come back
 
""
 uhm uhm   
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
uhm but i think it  ' s quite difficult because if we don't pull
down this building   how  are they going to what build  s
 what something else like a student flat   and  those tall i
  don't  know buildings 
""
""
 uh  
""
 uh  
""
 yah  
""
""
advice from civil engineer or the would-be   civil 
engineer
""
""
 uh   i think if the old building is remained then
uhm  tut  if we want to change the internal uh design   or
 something like that and and i think that is very difficult  
because  uhm we should solve the problem uhm of the uhm loading because
uh we we should use something to support the building but   if we 
uh  want to just uh like uh to pull down this wall then how come
 
""
 uh huh  
""
 uhm   
""
""
 yeah  
 
""
are they 
""
""
  yeah 
""
""
 yeah   yeah you you mean that it will be the most
efficient ways to  h  to hold   more    people 
 
""
 yah   
""
""
 yah  
""
""
yah actually i see this point but i just feel it  ' s too it  ' s
really  tut  a pity that to to pull it down
""
""
uhm
""
""
but at least we have to view it from  ec  economic
point of view   to 
 
""
 yah   
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
hh 
""
""
uhm
""
""
because i really looking forward to to bring my children back
to this hall after they five or ten years
 
""
oh five years 
""
""
at least five years
""
okay just for example five years or ten   years   
yah 
""
""
 uhm uhm     it  ' s  your dream
 
""
well actually i like ho tung hall yeah 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
being a lady hall what a hundred of residents 
""
""
uhm uhm
 
""
yes you really get like the hall the relationship between
hall-mates     are really uhm gets what intimate or very
friendly uh huh

""

""
""

""
""

""

""

some like some place like new territories or sai kung   yah yah it  ' s

yah full   of  dust   i  think it  ' s
already better here   yah  and as you go to the southern side of
