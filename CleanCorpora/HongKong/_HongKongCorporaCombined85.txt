selfish you just want people to fill and   just receive actually   one-word   yeah   i see  sure   laughs  so you are going you are going back to campus tonight right  it ' s between   yeah uhm because i must finish all my job and before before the before the morning  because the assignment have been late for about three month    yeah  but three three weeks no   laughs   yeah   me too  actually it ' s not such a a big a big work a a very heavy work work workload to me tonight  yeah not a very fantastic typing speed usually i don't i i usually spend uhm about five hours to to prepare my essay and then i have to spend more than four hours typing    one-word   uhm   you only use two figures to try to one figure okay   laughs   to  to    one-word   no i i never look at the monitor right now type typing oh i just look at your keyboard  where is a where is b oh where is e z oh i can't find e z uh where is it  two-words so   oh  so the the the computer will be hang hang hang one- word   laughs  yes uh i i ' m i am just totally handicapped in using computer i know you are   why don't you learn how to type  uhm i have learnt actually but you are lazy and you are not clever enough  yes  i don't like it at all actually  i ' m not using computer but the computer using me actually   one- word   oh   but but if you if you type more then you you would learn how to type more uh quickly and  two-words  yeah just like i i i type the chinese word is even more faster than type the english because i use to type chinese all my essay is typed in chinese   laughs  all the dissertation yeah is typed in chinese   some typing mistakes   don't talk don't talk don't tell me about chinese words typing no   one-word it ' s very easy to you yeah   laughs  very easy and how about you clinton you one-word got very fast typing speed   very decent good enough for me to survive   laughs  but but do you look at the keyboard when you type   no i look at the at the screen when i type   wah  then you are very lucky uh and very happy   uh   uhm   you know sometimes i well when typing in computer centre i have to pretend that i can i can type very fast because someone beside me sometime may one-word  what are you doing no you know   laughs it ' s it ' s really embarrassing sometimes no i don't think it ' s embarrassing  because because i i i have seen some uh foreigner  the gwai lou cantonese=foreigner   they they type really really fast just like   one-word i don't know they are   one-word   no   uhm   faster faster than they ' re writing on their own no no i can say the the the letter show on the monitor show on the screen is even more lower than the than the typing speed  uh maybe maybe the gwai lou  cantonese=foreigner is different from  may maybe they begin to type since they are very young a long pause   uhm uhm  you may forget uhm  how to spell the word uh without keyboard yeah and they use to click click click   click  yeah yeah so what do you   and  laugh  so what do you think clinton  click click   yes    yeah   and  laugh  sometimes we do tend uh type faster than we write and most of the time no reason why we can type so quickly because we expressing our thought immediately into the word document rather than thinking about that and then having to translate it  uhm yes i have to tran translate it in a long pause  yeah sometimes uhm i found that uhm uh i found that the thing that uh i ' ve typed is quite different for more what i ' ve thought before really yes oh yes  then you must know how to type one- word   and  oh especially tut  you know i i si i was i studied uhm  history  typing  history yes in my in my a-level   uh you study history yes so i ' m used to to write essay you know a long pause   a-level   a-level or one-word  a-level in chinese in english    one-word  so that ' s why   a-level history  so that ' s why i i can write very fast  yes yes i can write very very fast  oh  oh one-word you you study a-level history and   what about other  yeah  history and chinese history yeah three a-level subjects   no uhm  chinese history is uhm as-level yeah  as-level   oh i see i studied the uh applied maths pure maths  and physics all in a-level   and you teaching chinese now  yeah because because in in in fact i i don't like maths  because uhm my maths is very poor poor enough  i ' ve got a e ten in my a-level and a e nine in my uh a  maths and the     one-word   me too     then how did you come into hong kong u  well because i because you you know you know the faculty of education uhm is mainly tut uhm come in by by interview but not look at your your your a-level result   so you got a two-words  you know the    several words of you guys   and  laugh  yeah pouring water to my lect to my uh to my lecturer then they say uh this guy his uh his skill of pouring water is very excellent then he is suitable for uh being a teacher to pour water to all the class but but but did you know uh my my uh my student when i have my teaching practice they said my penmanship your writing is very ugly   uhm uhm two-words   laughs   and and said oh oh uh sir you your penmanship very ugly why why why you can be a chinese teacher then i then then there even some student said oh you are so  short why can you be our you better sit here and i and i come out  one- word   laughs   yeah  and and and some and some student uh just uhm uh suddenly stand up at the in the lesson and when i just walk around they suddenly stand up and compare and then sit down and all the class laugh yes    uhm  he tries to tease you  yeah  yeah but i but i just told them well uh i can be your teacher not because of my height but because of my iq and wisdom so if you are clever than me then you can be my teacher  and and and in my uhm form two class there are one student he is older than me  yeah    uh  are you sure yeah because my class is mainly uh people come from china mainland china the new new immigrant from china   uhm uh  he must be ver he must be very old if he ' s older than you and     yeah  because he is study form two in my sing   cantonese=to-advance form two  uh he come from one-word a long pause    uhm uhm   one-word school i think you have to encourage him because you know maybe sometimes he will feel  one-word  he ' s quite embarrassing to one-word  yeah yeah a long pause  and and at the last day of my teaching they they give me a  a a gift  yeah a present a a photo film  and uh what is call the flower the flower and    what ' s that   uhm     one-word   flo the dry one the the the real one the paper one the silk one   laughs  the plastic one   uh no   no   they just and give me some flower and  and uh yeah  uh ha    he ' s very happy   laughs  so i think uhm yes i remember you have said that uhm when  when the lectures uhm because during one-word  you you are suitable for you are suitable uh for being a teacher  one-word   maybe they they will consider your presentation skill  even though you know a a lot of teachers they they really they do know yes they have a lot of yeah but they have learnt a lot but sometimes they cannot express what they are  one- word to students   yeah     no   yeah i know i know many many lecturer they they know a lot but they can't they can't two-words still   yeah   just like   laughs   yeah just like the the     some some lecturers in hong kong i think    but i but i i people  but i think they are still good teacher because they have they have the hearts of to to to teach their students yes yeah but not uh but i know i know some teacher maybe they have very good teaching skill but they no heart indeed yes i just know that they are earning a very high very high very high salary right
